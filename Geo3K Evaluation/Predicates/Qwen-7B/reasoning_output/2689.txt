STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2689
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two rectangles, one above the other, connected along one of their sides.
- The rectangles have vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- Each rectangle has dimensions specified as follows:
  - The top rectangle has dimensions 5 units by 2 units.
  - The bottom rectangle also has dimensions 5 units by 2 units.
- The rectangles are aligned such that the side connecting the rectangles is the same length as the width of each rectangle (2 units).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both rectangles are rectangles.
- The rectangles share a common side of length 2 units.
- The rectangles do not overlap; they are placed consecutively along the shared side.
- The rectangles are not rotated or tilted relative to each other.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The width of each rectangle is 2 units.
- The length of each rectangle is 5 units.
- The total length of the figure is the sum of the lengths of the rectangles minus the overlap (2 units).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of the figure.
- The perimeter of the figure will be the sum of the lengths of its outer edges.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangles and their dimensions.
- Represent the shared side as part of the perimeter calculation.
