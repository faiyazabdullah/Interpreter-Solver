STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2988
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 11 units
- Side BC is marked as 21 degrees
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular
- Side AC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 11 units (given)
- BC = 21 degrees (angle measure given, but not used for lengths)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle
- The problem involves finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
