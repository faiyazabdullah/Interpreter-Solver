STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2494
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram ABCD with points A, B, C, and D labeled.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, and DA are drawn, forming the parallelogram.
- Angles A, B, C, and D are marked with right angle symbols.
- Points E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z are labeled on the lines extending from the parallelogram.
- Numerical values are provided: 2x + 3, 6 - x, 4/3y + 1, 2y, and 2x + 3 are labeled near specific points.
- Right angle symbols are present at points A, B, C, and D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram.
- Angles A, B, C, and D are right angles.
- Line segments AB, BC, CD, and DA are equal in pairs due to the properties of a parallelogram.
- The numerical values suggest relationships involving lengths of sides and diagonals.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Numerical values 2x + 3, 6 - x, 4/3y + 1, and 2y are present.
- These values likely represent lengths of segments related to the parallelogram's diagonals and sides.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of x.
- The relationship between the numerical values suggests a linear equation involving x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, right angles, lengths, and the relationship between the numerical values.
- Must capture the linear equation involving x.
