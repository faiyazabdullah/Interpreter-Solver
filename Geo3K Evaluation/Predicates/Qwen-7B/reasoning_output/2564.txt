STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2564
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure consisting of a rectangle and two overlapping circles.
- The rectangle has dimensions 10 cm by 5 cm.
- The circles have a diameter of 5 cm, meaning the radius is 2.5 cm.
- The circles overlap such that their centers are aligned horizontally along the rectangle's width.
- The overlapping region forms a lens-shaped area where the circles intersect.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The rectangles' sides are parallel to the x-axis and y-axis.
- The circles are centered at points H and A.
- The circles are tangent to each other and to the rectangle.
- The overlapping region is symmetric about the horizontal axis passing through the centers of the circles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of the rectangle is 10 cm.
- The width of the rectangle is 5 cm.
- The diameter of each circle is 5 cm, so the radius is 2.5 cm.
- The distance between the centers of the circles (H and A) is equal to the length of the rectangle minus the diameter of one circle, which is \(10 - 5 = 5\) cm.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- The shaded region is formed by the intersection of the two circles within the rectangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle, circles, and the overlapping region.
- Use the radii of the circles and the dimensions of the rectangle to calculate the area of the overlapping region.
