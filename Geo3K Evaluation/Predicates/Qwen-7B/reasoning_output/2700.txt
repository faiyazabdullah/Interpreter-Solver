STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2700
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 15 mm.
- Side AD is marked as 15 mm.
- Side CD is marked as 15 mm.
- Side BC is marked as 15 mm.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.
- There is a diagonal AC connecting points A and C, forming a right triangle with a 30-degree angle at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Rectangle ABCD with all right angles.
- AB = BC = CD = DA = 15 mm.
- Diagonal AC forms a right triangle with angles at A and C.
- The angle at C is 30 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = BC = CD = DA = 15 mm (given).
- Angle at C is 30 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the rectangle.
- The area of a rectangle is calculated as length times width.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
