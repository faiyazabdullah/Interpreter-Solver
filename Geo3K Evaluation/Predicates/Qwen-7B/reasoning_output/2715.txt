REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Angles at vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are labeled as \((Ax - 8)^\circ\), \(\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^\circ\), \((x - 12)^\circ\), and \((3y - 4)^\circ\) respectively.
- The quadrilateral appears to have some symmetry or specific relationships among its angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral could be a parallelogram if opposite angles are equal.
- If \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, then \(\angle A = \angle C\) and \(\angle B = \angle D\).
- Given the angles, we need to check if they satisfy the properties of a parallelogram.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles at vertices \(A\) and \(C\) are \((Ax - 8)^\circ\) and \((x - 12)^\circ\) respectively.
- The angles at vertices \(B\) and \(D\) are \(\left(\frac{1}{2}y\right)^\circ\) and \((3y - 4)^\circ\) respectively.
- For the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, \(\angle A + \angle C = 180^\circ\) and \(\angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \(x\) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- We need to use the property of parallelograms where opposite angles are equal.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and their relationships to form a parallelogram.
- We will use the given angles to derive the value of \(x\).
