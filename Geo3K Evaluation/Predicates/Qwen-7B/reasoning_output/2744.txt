STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2744
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle A B C if m \angle C D A = 61.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Angle ABD is labeled as 69 degrees.
- Angle CDA is labeled as 55 degrees.
- Angle BDC is marked as 61 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is given.
- Angles ABD and CDA are marked with specific measures.
- Angle BDC is explicitly labeled as 61 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ABD = 69 degrees
- Angle CDA = 55 degrees
- Angle BDC = 61 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for m âˆ ABC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, angles, and the relationship between them.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
