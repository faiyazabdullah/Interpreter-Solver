STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2871
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the kite.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a kite labeled ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AD is marked as 21 cm.
- Side AB is marked as 32 cm.
- There is a dashed line from point A to point B, suggesting a perpendicular line segment within the kite.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The kite has two pairs of equal sides: AD = DC and AB = BC.
- The dashed line from A to B appears to be the height of the kite when AD is the base.
- The kite is symmetric along the dashed line.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 21 cm.
- AB = 32 cm.
- The height of the kite (dashed line from A to B) is the perpendicular distance between AD and AB, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the kite.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the kite.
- To find the area, we need the base and the height of the kite.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the kite, its sides, the height, and the area calculation.
