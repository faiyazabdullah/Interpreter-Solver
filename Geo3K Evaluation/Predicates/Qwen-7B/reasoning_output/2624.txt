STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2624
================================================================================
QUESTION: m \angle 9 = 2 x - 4, m \angle 10 = 2 x + 4. Find the measure of \angle 10.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, CE, and DE are present.
- Angles ∠9 and ∠10 are marked with numerical measures.
- ∠9 is labeled as 2x - 4 degrees.
- ∠10 is labeled as 2x + 4 degrees.
- Points B and C form a straight line.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line AB is collinear with line BC.
- Line BC intersects line CE at point C.
- Line CD intersects line CE at point C.
- ∠9 and ∠10 are adjacent angles formed by line BC and line CE at point C.
- ∠9 and ∠10 are supplementary angles since they form a straight line at point C.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠9 = 2x - 4 degrees.
- ∠10 = 2x + 4 degrees.
- The sum of ∠9 and ∠10 is 180 degrees because they form a straight line.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the measure of ∠10.
- Since ∠9 and ∠10 are supplementary, we can use the relationship ∠9 + ∠10 = 180 degrees to find the value of x and subsequently ∠10.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the angles, their measures, and the supplementary relationship.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
