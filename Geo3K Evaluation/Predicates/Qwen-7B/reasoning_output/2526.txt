STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2526
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 2 if A B \perp B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with several triangles and lines.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F are labeled.
- Angles are labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- Angles 1, 2, 3, 4 are part of triangle ABE.
- Angles 5, 6, 7, 8 are part of triangle BCE.
- Line segments AB, BC, BE, DE, EF, and FC are marked.
- Angles are labeled with numerical values: 36°, 104°, and 40°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABE and triangle BCE share side BE.
- Triangle ABE has angles 36°, 104°, and 2.
- Triangle BCE has angles 40°, 36°, and 104°.
- Since AB ⊥ BC, angle 2 must be 90° because the sum of angles in triangle ABE plus angle 2 equals 180°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle 2 is required to be found.
- The given angles are 36°, 104°, and 40°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 2.
- Since AB ⊥ BC, angle 2 must be 90°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the perpendicularity and the angles.
