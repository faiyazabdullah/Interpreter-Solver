STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2898
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a composite shape consisting of a rectangle and two semicircles.
- The rectangle has dimensions labeled as follows: the width is 8 units and the height is 3 units.
- The semicircles are attached to the top and bottom sides of the rectangle, with diameters equal to the width of the rectangle (8 units).
- There are right angle symbols at the corners of the rectangle.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The rectangle is composed of four right angles.
- The semicircles are attached to the top and bottom sides of the rectangle, forming a continuous shape.
- The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the width of the rectangle (8 units).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The width of the rectangle (base of the semicircles) is 8 units.
- The height of the rectangle is 3 units.
- The radius of each semicircle is half of the diameter, which is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the entire shape.
- To find the area, we need to calculate the area of the rectangle and add the areas of the two semicircles.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle and the semicircles.
- We will use the area formulas for a rectangle and a semicircle.
