STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2847
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \widehat J K L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center C.
- Points J and K lie on the circumference of the circle.
- There is a straight line segment HJKB.
- An angle ∠AJK is labeled with a measure of 116°.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- J and K are points on the circumference of the circle.
- HJKB forms a cyclic quadrilateral because J and K are on the same circle.
- ∠AJK is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AJK.
- Since ∠AJK = 116°, the central angle ∠ACJ subtended by the same arc AJK is twice the inscribed angle (∠ACJ = 2 * ∠AJK).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠AJK = 116° is given.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc JK.
- The measure of arc JK is related to the central angle ∠ACJ.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points on the circle, angle measures, and the relationship between the inscribed and central angles.
