STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2776
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral A B C D is a rectangle. m \angle 2 = 40. Find m \angle 8.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, and DA form the sides of the rectangle.
- Angles at vertices A, B, C, and D are right angles.
- Points E lies inside the rectangle.
- Angles ∠2 and ∠8 are marked within the rectangle.
- The measurement m∠2 = 40° is provided.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.
- All internal angles of a rectangle are right angles.
- ∠2 and ∠8 are angles within the rectangle, but they are not necessarily related directly through the provided information.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠2 = 40° (given)
- No other specific lengths or angles are provided except for the right angles and the rectangle's properties.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find m∠8.
- Since no direct relationship between ∠2 and ∠8 is provided, we cannot determine m∠8 from the given information alone without additional geometric relationships or properties of the rectangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle and its right angles.
- We also need to indicate that ∠2 is given as 40°.
- However, since there is no direct relationship provided between ∠2 and ∠8, we cannot generate predicates that would directly solve the question.
