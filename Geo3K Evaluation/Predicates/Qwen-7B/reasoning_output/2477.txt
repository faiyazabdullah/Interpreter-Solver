STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2477
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle.
- Angle \(ABC\) is given as \(122^\circ\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles is \(180^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle ADC + \angle ABC = 180^\circ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurement provided is \(\angle ABC = 122^\circ\).
- Using the cyclic property, we need to find \(\angle ADC\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle ADC\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral, the given angle, and the relationship between the angles.
