STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2478
================================================================================
QUESTION: If \triangle L M N \sim \triangle Q R S, Q R = 35, R S = 37, S Q = 12, and N L = 5, find the perimeter of \triangle L M N.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles labeled \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle QRS \).
- Triangle \( \triangle LMN \) has a right angle at \( L \) indicated by the small square symbol.
- Triangle \( \triangle QRS \) has sides labeled as \( QR = 35 \), \( RS = 37 \), and \( SQ = 12 \).
- There is no indication of a right angle at \( Q \) or \( R \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle QRS \) appear similar based on the given lengths and right angle.
- No direct parallelism or perpendicularity between corresponding sides of the triangles is indicated.
- The triangles do not appear to be congruent because the lengths of their sides are different.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths: \( QR = 35 \), \( RS = 37 \), \( SQ = 12 \).
- Right angle at \( L \) in \( \triangle LMN \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of \( \triangle LMN \).
- We need to determine the lengths of sides \( LM \) and \( MN \) using the similarity relationship.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and their relationships.
- Capture the lengths of sides.
- Represent the perimeter calculation.
