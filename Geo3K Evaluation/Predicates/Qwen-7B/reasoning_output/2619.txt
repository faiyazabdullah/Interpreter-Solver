STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2619
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral E F G H is a rectangle. If F K = 32 feet, find E G.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle EFGH with vertices labeled E, F, G, H.
- Side EF is marked as 32 feet.
- The figure has right angles at vertices E, F, G, and H.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral EFGH is a rectangle.
- Angles at vertices E, F, G, and H are right angles.
- Opposite sides EF and HG are parallel and equal.
- Opposite sides EH and FG are parallel and equal.
- Diagonals EG and FH intersect at point K.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- F K = 32 feet (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of EG.
- In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, and the diagonal length.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
