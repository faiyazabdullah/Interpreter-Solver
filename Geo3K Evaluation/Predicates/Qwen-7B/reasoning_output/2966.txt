STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2966
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find z in the given parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram labeled as ABCD.
- Points A, B, C, and D are marked.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, and DA are drawn.
- Angles at points A, B, C, and D are marked.
- Line segment EC is labeled as \(3z - 4\).
- Line segment EB is labeled as \(z + 5\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, implying opposite sides are equal.
- Therefore, AB = CD and AD = BC.
- Since AB is labeled as \(z + 5\) and CD is labeled as \(3z - 4\), we need to equate them due to the property of the parallelogram.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = \(z + 5\)
- CD = \(3z - 4\)
- To find \(z\), set AB equal to CD: 
  \[
  z + 5 = 3z - 4
  \]

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \(z\).
- We need to solve the equation obtained from the parallelogram's property.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, equal lengths of opposite sides, and the algebraic relationship involving \(z\).
