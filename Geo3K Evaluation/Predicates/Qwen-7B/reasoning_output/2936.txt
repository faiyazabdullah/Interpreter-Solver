STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2936
================================================================================
QUESTION: Express the ratio of \tan M as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \(PQN\) with vertices labeled \(P\), \(Q\), and \(N\).
- Side \(PN\) is marked as 15 units.
- Side \(QN\) is marked as 39 units.
- Side \(PQ\) is marked as 36 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(Q\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(PQN\) is a right triangle with right angle at vertex \(Q\).
- Sides \(PQ\) and \(QN\) are perpendicular.
- Side \(PN\) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(PN = 15\) units.
- \(QN = 39\) units.
- \(PQ = 36\) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(\tan M\) where \(M\) is the angle opposite side \(PN\) in triangle \(PQN\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and the tangent function.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties related to the tangent function.
