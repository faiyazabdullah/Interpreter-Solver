STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2812
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is inscribed in \odot V. Find m \angle X.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a cyclic quadrilateral \( WXYZ \) inscribed in a circle centered at \( V \).
- Points \( W, X, Y, Z \) lie on the circle.
- Angles \( \angle WZ \) and \( \angle WX \) are marked.
- \( \angle WZ = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle WX = 95^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \( WXYZ \) is inscribed in circle \( \odot V \).
- The opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( \angle WZ = 60^\circ \)
- \( \angle WX = 95^\circ \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( m\angle X \).
- To solve this, we need to use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral relationship and the given angles.
