STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2989
================================================================================
QUESTION: For the pair of similar figures, use the given areas to find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two similar quadrilaterals, one shaded blue and the other shaded green.
- The blue quadrilateral is labeled as ABCD with diagonals connecting opposite vertices.
- The green quadrilateral is labeled as ABCD' with side lengths labeled as \(x \ mm\).
- The area of the blue quadrilateral is given as \(400 \ mm^2\).
- The area of the green quadrilateral is given as \(64 \ mm^2\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both quadrilaterals are similar.
- The areas of the quadrilaterals are proportional to the squares of their corresponding side lengths.
- Since the quadrilaterals are similar, the ratio of their areas is equal to the square of the ratio of their side lengths.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Area of blue quadrilateral \( A_{\text{blue}} = 400 \ mm^2 \).
- Area of green quadrilateral \( A_{\text{green}} = 64 \ mm^2 \).
- Let the side length of the green quadrilateral be \( x \ mm \).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).
- We need to use the similarity property and the relationship between the areas of similar shapes.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the areas and the similarity constraint.
- The area ratio will help us find the value of \( x \).
