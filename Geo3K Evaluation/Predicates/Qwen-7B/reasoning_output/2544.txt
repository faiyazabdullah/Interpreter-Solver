STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2544
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle K L M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram JKLM with vertices labeled J, K, L, and M.
- Side JK is marked as 6 units.
- There is an angle at vertex K labeled as 109°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral JKLM is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
- Consecutive angles sum to 180°.
- Angles at opposite vertices are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 6 units (given).
- The angle at K is 109° (given).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle KLM.
- Since JKLM is a parallelogram, angle KLM will have the same measure as angle JKM because consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, the given angle measurement, and the relationship between the angles.
