STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2841
================================================================================
QUESTION: Express the ratio of \cos A as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 20 units.
- Side BC is marked as 15 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse and is marked as 25 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 20 units (given)
- BC = 15 units (given)
- AC = 25 units (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the ratio of \(\cos A\).
- This requires using the cosine function and the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and the cosine relationship.
