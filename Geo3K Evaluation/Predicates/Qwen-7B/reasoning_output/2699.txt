STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2699
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot X, A B = 30, C D = 30, and m \widehat C Z = 40. Find N D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center X, labeled as Circle(X).
- Points A, B, C, D, M, N, Y, and Z lie on the circle.
- The arc \(\widehat{CZ}\) is labeled as 40 degrees.
- Line segments AB and CD are each equal to 30 units.
- Point M lies on AB, point N lies on CD, and points Y, X, and Z are marked but not necessarily on the circle.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AB = CD = 30 units, they appear to be chords of the circle.
- Arc \(\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\), implying \(\widehat{ZY} = 40^\circ\) because arcs subtended by the same central angle are equal.
- Points M and N seem to be midpoints of AB and CD respectively, as suggested by the perpendicular lines from the center X.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 30 units.
- CD = 30 units.
- \(\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for ND.
- ND appears to be the distance between point N and the center of the circle X, as M is the midpoint of AB and N is the midpoint of CD.
- Given symmetry and equal lengths of chords AB and CD, ND likely equals the radius of the circle since N is equidistant from the circle's center along the chord CD.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, its center, the chords, the arcs, the midpoints, and the distances.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
