STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2865
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram A B C D to find A D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\).
- Side \(AB\) is marked as 18 units.
- Side \(CD\) is marked as 12 units.
- The angle \(\angle DAB\) is marked as \(115^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides \(AB\) and \(CD\) are equal in length and parallel.
- Opposite angles \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle CDA\) are equal.
- Adjacent angles \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle DAB\) sum up to \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 18\) units (given)
- \(CD = 12\) units (given)
- \(\angle DAB = 115^\circ\) (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(AD\).
- Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, \(AD = BC\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and relationships.
- Must include the given lengths and the property of a parallelogram.
