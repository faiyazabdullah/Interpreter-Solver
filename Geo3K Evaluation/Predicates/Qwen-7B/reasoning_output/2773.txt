STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2773
================================================================================
QUESTION: P is the incenter of \triangle A E C. Find m \angle D E P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple triangles and points.
- Points labeled are A, B, C, D, E, F, H, and P.
- Lines connecting these points form several triangles.
- Angles are marked at point A, D, and C.
- Specific measurements are given for some segments: AB = 13, BC = 10.9, AE = 14.9, EC = 10.9, and DE = 14.9.
- Right angle symbols are present at angles DPC and EPC.
- The point P appears to be the incenter of triangle AEC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle AEC has point P as its incenter.
- Triangle ADE is formed by point D and segments AD, DE, and AE.
- Triangles ADB and AEC share the common vertex A and segment AB.
- Angles at points D and C are marked, with ∠ADC = 33° and ∠ACB = 28.5°.
- Right angles are indicated at points D and E.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Lengths: AB = 13, BC = 10.9, AE = 14.9, EC = 10.9, and DE = 14.9.
- ∠ADC = 33° and ∠ACB = 28.5° are marked.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠DEP, where P is the incenter of triangle AEC.
- The incenter of a triangle is equidistant from all sides of the triangle, meaning ∠DPC and ∠EPC are equal to half the sum of the angles at the vertices minus the angle at the opposite vertex.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the incenter property, the given lengths, and the specific angles.
- The predicates will capture the incenter relationship, the lengths of the segments, and the marked angles.
