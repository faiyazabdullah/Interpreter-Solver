STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2626
================================================================================
QUESTION: What is the area of \parallelogram A B C D?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Side \(AD\) is marked as \(10\) meters.
- Side \(BC\) is marked as \(6\) meters.
- There are right angle symbols at vertices \(B\) and \(D\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.
- Angles \(ABD\) and \(BDC\) are right angles.
- \(AD\) and \(BC\) are parallel and equal in length.
- \(AB\) and \(CD\) are also parallel and equal in length.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AD = 10\) meters.
- \(BC = 6\) meters.
- The right angles imply specific relationships between sides.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of parallelogram \(ABCD\).
- To find the area, we need the base and height of the parallelogram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram, its sides, and the right angles.
- Capture the lengths of the sides and the relationship between them.
