STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2669
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a straight line segment DE extended infinitely in both directions.
- A point F lies on line segment BC.
- Line segments BF and EF form a right angle at point F.
- A point A is positioned such that AF is perpendicular to the line containing DE and BC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line segments DE and BC are parallel.
- Line segments BF and EF form a right angle at point F.
- Points D, E, F, B, and C lie on the same line.
- Line segment AF is perpendicular to the line containing DE and BC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle x, which is formed by the intersection of line segments BF and EF.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelism, right angle, and the relationship between the angles.
