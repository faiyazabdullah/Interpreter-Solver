STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2650
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Line segment \(AB\) is marked as 8.8 units.
- Line segment \(BC\) is marked as 8.5 units.
- Line segment \(AD\) is marked as 8.8 units.
- Line segment \(CD\) is marked as \(x\) units.
- Line segment \(BD\) is marked as \(y\) units.
- Line segment \(AC\) is marked as \(z\) units.
- There are right angle symbols at points \(B\) and \(D\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles \(ABD\) and \(BCD\) are right triangles because there are right angle symbols at \(B\) and \(D\).
- \(BD\) is perpendicular to both \(AB\) and \(CD\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 8.8\) units (given).
- \(BC = 8.5\) units (given).
- \(AD = 8.8\) units (given).
- \(CD\) is marked as \(x\) units (unknown).
- \(BD\) is marked as \(y\) units (unknown).
- \(AC\) is marked as \(z\) units (unknown).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(x\), which represents the length of line segment \(CD\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, right angles, lengths, and relationships between segments.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
