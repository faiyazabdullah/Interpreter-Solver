STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2687
================================================================================
QUESTION: The diameters of \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C are 10, 30 and 10 units, respectively. Find A C if A Z \cong C W and C W = 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three circles with diameters labeled as follows:
  - Circle A with diameter AZ = 10 units
  - Circle B with diameter BY = 30 units
  - Circle C with diameter CW = 10 units
- Points X and Y lie on the line segment AB.
- Points Z and W lie on the line segment CD.
- It is given that A Z ≅ C W and C W = 2 units.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Circle A has diameter AZ = 10 units.
- Circle B has diameter BY = 30 units.
- Circle C has diameter CW = 10 units.
- A Z ≅ C W implies A Z = C W.
- C W = 2 units, so A Z = 2 units.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AZ = 10 units (given).
- C W = 2 units (given).
- A Z = C W (congruence).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for AC.
- We need to determine the length of AC using the given information.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circles, diameters, lengths, and congruences.
- Must include the given lengths and relationships.
