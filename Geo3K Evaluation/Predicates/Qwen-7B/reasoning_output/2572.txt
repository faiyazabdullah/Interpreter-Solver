================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle M P Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a triangle \(MNP\) with point \(P\) lying on the line segment \(QN\).
- The triangle \(MNP\) has angles labeled as follows:
  - \(\angle MPN = 56^\circ\)
  - \(\angle MNP = 45^\circ\)
- Point \(Q\) is outside the triangle.
- The line segment \(QN\) passes through point \(P\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(MNP\) is a triangle with internal angles summing up to \(180^\circ\).
- The angle at vertex \(P\) is given as \(56^\circ\).
- The angle at vertex \(N\) is given as \(45^\circ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle MPN = 56^\circ\)
- \(\angle MNP = 45^\circ\)
- The third angle in triangle \(MNP\) can be calculated using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\):
  \[
  \angle MPN + \angle MPN + \angle MNP = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  56^\circ + \angle MPN + 45^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle MPN = 180^\circ - 56^\circ - 45^\circ = 79^\circ
  \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle MPQ\).
- To find \(\angle MPQ\), we need to use the properties of the angles formed by the intersection of lines and the angles within the triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and its angles.
- Capture the given angles.
- Calculate the third angle of the triangle.
