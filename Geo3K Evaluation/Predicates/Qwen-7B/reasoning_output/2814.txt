STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2814
================================================================================
QUESTION: If W X Y Z is a kite, find W P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a kite labeled WXZY.
- Points W, X, Y, Z are vertices of the kite.
- WX and XY are equal sides, as indicated by the kite's symmetry.
- WP is a line segment connecting point W to point P.
- PX is a vertical line segment from point P to point X.
- PX = 4 units.
- WX = 6 units.
- WP = ? (the question asks for this value).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- WXZY forms a kite.
- WP bisects PX, meaning WP is the perpendicular bisector of PX.
- WP is the median of the triangle WXP.
- PX is the height of the kite from point P to line WX.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 6 units.
- PX = 4 units.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of WP.
- In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.
- Therefore, WP is the median of triangle WXP and can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle WXP.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the kite, the lengths of the sides, and the relationship between WP, PX, and WX.
