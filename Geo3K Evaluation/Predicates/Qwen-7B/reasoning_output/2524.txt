STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2524
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot Z, \angle W Z X \cong \angle X Z Y, m \angle V Z U = 4 x, m \angle U Z Y = 2 x + 24, and V Y and W U are diameters. Find m \widehat W U X.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at \(Z\) with points \(W, X, Y, U, V, L\) marked on it.
- Points \(W\) and \(U\) are diametrically opposite each other.
- Points \(V\) and \(L\) are also diametrically opposite each other.
- Angles \(\angle WZX \cong \angle XZY\).
- The measure of \(\angle VZU\) is given as \(4x\).
- The measure of \(\angle UZY\) is given as \(2x + 24\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(W\) and \(U\) are diametrically opposite, \(\angle WZX\) and \(\angle XZY\) are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc \(WZ\).
- Given \(\angle WZX \cong \angle XZY\), they are equal.
- The total angle around point \(Z\) is \(360^\circ\).
- \(\angle VZU\) and \(\angle UZY\) are related through the circle's properties.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle VZU = 4x\).
- \(\angle UZY = 2x + 24\).
- Since \(WZUX\) forms a cyclic quadrilateral, the sum of opposite angles equals \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the measure of \(\widehat{WUX}\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Circle \(Z\) with points on it.
- Diametrically opposite points \(W\) and \(U\).
- Angles \(\angle WZX \cong \angle XZY\).
- Given angles \(\angle VZU = 4x\) and \(\angle UZY = 2x + 24\).
