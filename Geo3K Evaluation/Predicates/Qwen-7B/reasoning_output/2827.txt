STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2827
================================================================================
QUESTION: In rhombus A B C D, m \angle D A B = 2, m \angle A D C and C B = 6. Find m \angle A D B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- \(m \angle DAB = 2^\circ\).
- \(CB = 6\).
- The diagonals intersect at point \(E\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal, i.e., \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
- Therefore, \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).
- Since \(m \angle DAB = 2^\circ\), \(m \angle ABC = 2 \times 2^\circ = 4^\circ\) due to symmetry in a rhombus.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(CB = 6\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m \angle ADB\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, angles, lengths, and relationships.
