STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2981
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the rhombus.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- The diagonals of the rhombus are labeled as AC and BD.
- The length of diagonal BD is marked as 12 mm.
- The length of side AB is marked as 22 mm.
- Diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E, dividing the rhombus into four congruent triangles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure shows a rhombus with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point E.
- Diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
- Side AB is congruent to sides BC, CD, and DA.
- Angles ∠ABC and ∠ADC are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of diagonal BD = 12 mm
- Length of side AB = 22 mm
- Length of side AC can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem since the diagonals bisect each other perpendicularly.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- To find the area, we need the lengths of both diagonals.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rhombus and its diagonals.
- Capture the given length of diagonal BD.
- Calculate the length of diagonal AC using the Pythagorean theorem.
- Use the formula for the area of a rhombus (Area = (d1 * d2) / 2).
