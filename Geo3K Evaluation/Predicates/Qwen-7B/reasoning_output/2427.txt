================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( 5 \) units.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as \( 3\sqrt{2} \) units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( C \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( C \).
- Sides \( AC \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 5 \) units (given).
- \( BC = 3\sqrt{2} \) units (given).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AC \).
- To find \( AC \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
