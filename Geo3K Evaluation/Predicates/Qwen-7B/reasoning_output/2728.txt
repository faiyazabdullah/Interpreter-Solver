STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2728
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region formed by the circle and regular polygon. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a regular hexagon (Hexagon(A,B,C,D,E,F)) inscribed in a circle (Circle(A)).
- The center of the circle is point D.
- The radius of the circle is 10 cm.
- The vertices of the hexagon are labeled A, E, F, and C.
- The side length of the hexagon is not explicitly given, but we can use the radius to find it.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The hexagon is regular, so all sides are equal.
- The circle circumscribes the hexagon.
- The radius of the circle is the distance from the center D to any vertex, which is 10 cm.
- The vertices of the hexagon divide the circle into six equal arcs.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RadiusOf(Circle(A)) = 10 cm (given).
- The side length of the hexagon can be found using the formula for the side length of a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle, which is \( s = R \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region formed by the circle and the regular hexagon.
- The shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the hexagon.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the hexagon, the radius, and the area calculations.
- We will calculate the area of the circle and the area of the hexagon separately and then subtract them.
