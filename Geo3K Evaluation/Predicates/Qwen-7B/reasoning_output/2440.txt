STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2440
================================================================================
QUESTION: Polygon A B C D \sim polygon A E F G, m \angle A G F = 108, G F = 14, A D = 12, D G = 4.5, E F = 8, and A B = 26. Find m \angle A D C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure includes two distinct polygons: quadrilateral \(ABCD\) and quadrilateral \(AEFG\).
- The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has vertices labeled \(A, B, C, D\).
- The quadrilateral \(AEFG\) has vertices labeled \(A, E, F, G\).
- The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) contains a right angle symbol at vertex \(D\).
- The quadrilateral \(AEFG\) contains an angle \(108^\circ\) at vertex \(G\).
- The lengths \(AD = 12\), \(DG = 4.5\), \(EF = 8\), and \(AB = 26\).
- The length \(GF = 14\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle because it contains a right angle at \(D\).
- Quadrilateral \(AEFG\) appears to be a parallelogram since \(E\) and \(F\) are equidistant from \(A\) and \(G\) respectively, and the angles at \(E\) and \(G\) suggest symmetry.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AD = 12\)
- \(DG = 4.5\)
- \(EF = 8\)
- \(AB = 26\)
- \(GF = 14\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\).
- To solve this, we need to use the properties of rectangles and the fact that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the quadrilateral relationships, angles, and given lengths.
