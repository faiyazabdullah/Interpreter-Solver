STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2575
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral QRST inscribed in a circle with center O.
- Points Q, R, S, T lie on the circumference of the circle.
- The central angle ∠ROS is given as 32°.
- Angles ∠QRS and ∠QTS are marked with expressions involving x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral QRST is cyclic because it lies on a circle.
- Angles ∠QRS and ∠QTS are subtended by the same arc RS.
- Therefore, they are equal due to the property of cyclic quadrilaterals that opposite angles are supplementary and angles subtended by the same arc are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠ROS = 32°.
- ∠QRS = (5x + 4)°.
- ∠QTS = (6x - 2)°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find m∠S.
- Since ∠QRS and ∠QTS are equal, we can set up the equation: (5x + 4) = (6x - 2).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral, angles subtended by the same arc, and the given expressions for angles.
