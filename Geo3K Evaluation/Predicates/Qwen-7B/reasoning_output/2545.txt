STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2545
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a large semicircle with a smaller semicircle inside it.
- The smaller semicircle is positioned such that its diameter lies on the larger semicircle's diameter.
- Points A, F, C, G, and E are labeled along the diameter of the larger semicircle.
- The distance AF is labeled as 15 units.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The larger semicircle has a diameter of 15 units.
- The smaller semicircle fits exactly within the larger semicircle, meaning its diameter is half of the larger semicircle's diameter, i.e., 7.5 units.
- Points F, C, and G divide the diameter into three equal parts.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AF = FC = CG = GE = 5 units (since the diameter is divided into four equal parts).
- The total length from A to E is 15 units, which matches the given measurement.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- The shaded region consists of the area of the larger semicircle minus the areas of the two smaller semicircles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the semicircles, their diameters, and the area calculations.
