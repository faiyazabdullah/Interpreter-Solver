STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2622
================================================================================
QUESTION: For the pair of similar figures, find the area of the green figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two geometric figures.
- The larger figure is a parallelogram labeled as \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The smaller figure is a square labeled as \(EFGH\) with vertices \(E\), \(F\), \(G\), and \(H\).
- The parallelogram has sides \(AB = CD = 8 \, \text{yd}\) and \(AD = BC = 6 \, \text{yd}\).
- The square has side lengths \(EF = FG = GH = HE = 4 \, \text{yd}\).

- The parallelogram \(ABCD\) has its diagonal \(AC\) marked, and the area \(A = 36 \, \text{yd}^2\) is given for the parallelogram.

- The square \(EFGH\) is positioned next to the parallelogram, and its side length is indicated as \(4 \, \text{yd}\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both figures share a common property of having a right angle formed by the diagonal \(AC\) and side \(BC\) in the parallelogram.
- The parallelogram \(ABCD\) is divided into two congruent triangles by diagonal \(AC\).

- The square \(EFGH\) is positioned adjacent to the parallelogram such that one of its sides aligns perfectly with one side of the parallelogram (\(EF = BC = 4 \, \text{yd}\)).

- The square's diagonal \(EG\) is equal to the side length of the parallelogram (\(EF = 4 \, \text{yd}\)).

- The square is scaled down in size relative to the parallelogram.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is given as \(A = 36 \, \text{yd}^2\).

- The side length of the square \(EFGH\) is given as \(4 \, \text{yd}\).

- The diagonal of the square \(EFGH\) is \(4 \sqrt{2} \, \text{yd}\).

- The side length of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is \(4 \, \text{yd}\).

- The diagonal \(AC\) of the parallelogram divides it into two congruent triangles.

- The area of the parallelogram can be calculated using the formula \(A = \text{base} \times \text{height}\). Here, base \(= AD = 6 \, \text{yd}\), and height \(= BC = 4 \, \text{yd}\).

- Since the parallelogram is divided into two triangles by diagonal \(AC\), the area of each triangle is half the total area of the parallelogram.

- The scale factor of the square to the parallelogram is \(1:2\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the square \(EFGH\).

- The area of the square can be determined by multiplying the side length by itself (\(4 \, \text{yd} \times 4 \, \text{yd}\)).

- The scale factor of the square to the parallelogram is \(1:2\), meaning the square is half the size of the parallelogram along each dimension.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the shapes and their attributes.
- Capture the area relationship between the parallelogram and the square.
