STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2454
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked with a blue line extending horizontally, indicating it's the hypotenuse.
- Side BC is marked with a length of 9.7 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex A.
- Side BC is perpendicular to side AC.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BC = 9.7 units.
- AB is the hypotenuse and needs to be found.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AB, which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships involving the hypotenuse.
