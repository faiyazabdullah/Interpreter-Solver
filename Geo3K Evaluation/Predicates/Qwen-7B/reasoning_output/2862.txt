STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2862
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle W.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral XYZW.
- Angles at vertices X, Y, W, and Z are labeled as \(x^\circ\), \(2x^\circ\), \(3x^\circ\), and \(4x^\circ\) respectively.
- There are no special markings like parallel lines, perpendicular lines, or right angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral XYZW has four angles.
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\).

\[ x + 2x + 3x + 4x = 360^\circ \]

\[ 10x = 360^\circ \]

\[ x = 36^\circ \]

- Therefore, we need to find the measure of \(\angle W\).

\[ \text{Measure of } \angle W = 3x^\circ \]

\[ \text{Measure of } \angle W = 3 \times 36^\circ \]

\[ \text{Measure of } \angle W = 108^\circ \]

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We have determined that \( x = 36^\circ \).
- \(\angle W = 108^\circ\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle W\).
- We have already calculated the measure of \(\angle W\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral and its angles.
