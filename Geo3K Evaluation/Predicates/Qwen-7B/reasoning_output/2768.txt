STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2768
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60. Find the measure of \angle 4.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with various angles and lines.
- The angles are labeled as \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4 \).
- The specific angles \( \angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( \angle 3 = 60^\circ \) are given.
- There are no right angles or other special markings indicated in the diagram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- No specific geometric relationships such as parallelism, perpendicularity, or congruence are explicitly marked.
- Angles \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are given, but there is no direct relationship between them without additional context.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The only numerical values given are the measures of \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \).
- There are no lengths, widths, or other numerical measurements provided for lines or segments in the diagram.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 4 \).
- To solve for \( \angle 4 \), we need to use the given information about \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) and any relationships they might have within the figure.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Since no additional relationships or constraints are provided, we cannot generate specific predicates related to angles without making assumptions.
- The given angles \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) do not provide enough information to determine \( \angle 4 \).
