### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( V \).
- Points \( R, U, T, \) and \( S \) lie on the circle.
- Segments \( RU, RT, \) and \( UT \) are chords of the circle.
- Segment \( RS \) is a diameter of the circle.
- The length of chord \( RU \) is given as 8 units.
- The length of chord \( RT \) is given as 4 units.
- The length of chord \( UT \) is given as 4 units.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( RS \) is the diameter of the circle, it passes through the center \( V \).
- Chords \( RU \) and \( RT \) are both radii of the circle because they connect from the center \( V \) to the circle's circumference.
- Chord \( UT \) is equal to chord \( RT \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( RU = 8 \)
- \( RT = 4 \)
- \( UT = 4 \)
- The total length of the circle's circumference can be found if we know the radius.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the length of chord \( RS \).
- Since \( RS \) is the diameter of the circle, its length can be calculated using the formula for the length of a chord.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the chords, the diameter, and the lengths of the chords.
- The length of the diameter \( RS \) is twice the radius.
