STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2759
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of \parallelogram J K L M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram JKLM with vertices labeled J, K, L, and M.
- Side JM is marked as 4 cm.
- Side KL is marked as 7.2 cm.
- Height from J to KL is marked as 6 cm.
- There are no right angle symbols or perpendicular lines indicated.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a parallelogram.
- JM is parallel to KL.
- KL is parallel to JM.
- J to KL is perpendicular, indicating JM and KL are the lengths of the base and the height respectively.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of JM = 4 cm (base)
- Length of KL = 7.2 cm (base)
- Height from J to KL = 6 cm

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of parallelogram JKLM.
- To find the area, we need the formula: Area = base Ã— height.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, and the height.
