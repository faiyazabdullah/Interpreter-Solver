STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2995
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle B C D \cong \triangle W X Y. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle WXY\).
- In \(\triangle BCD\), vertex \(C\) is labeled with an angle measurement of \(20x - 4^\circ\).
- Vertex \(B\) has an angle measurement of \(24x + 5^\circ\).
- The third angle, \(\angle BDC\), is not explicitly labeled but can be calculated since the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
- Side \(BC\) is labeled as 11 units.
- In \(\triangle WXY\), vertex \(Y\) is labeled with an angle measurement of \(77^\circ\).
- Side \(WX\) is labeled as \(2x + 5\) units.
- Side \(WY\) is labeled as 77 units.
- No specific angles or sides are marked in \(\triangle WXY\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\triangle BCD\) and \(\triangle WXY\) are congruent, meaning they have the same shape and size.
- Therefore, corresponding angles and sides are equal.
- The angle at \(C\) in \(\triangle BCD\) is equal to the angle at \(Y\) in \(\triangle WXY\).
- The side \(BC\) in \(\triangle BCD\) is equal to the side \(WY\) in \(\triangle WXY\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angle at \(C\) in \(\triangle BCD\) is \(20x - 4^\circ\).
- The angle at \(Y\) in \(\triangle WXY\) is \(77^\circ\).
- The side \(BC\) in \(\triangle BCD\) is 11 units.
- The side \(WY\) in \(\triangle WXY\) is 77 units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(x\).
- Since \(\triangle BCD \cong \triangle WXY\), the angle at \(C\) in \(\triangle BCD\) should be equal to the angle at \(Y\) in \(\triangle WXY\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to express the equality of the angles.
- The lengths of corresponding sides must also be equal.
