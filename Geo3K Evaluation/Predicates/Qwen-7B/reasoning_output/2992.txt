STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2992
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of m \angle 2. Assume that segments that appear tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a tangent line and two radii extending from the center to the points of tangency.
- The circle is divided into arcs by a straight line segment connecting two points on the circumference, dividing the circle into two arcs.
- The arc measures are given as 85° and 230°.
- The points where the tangent meets the circle are marked, indicating the tangents are perpendicular to the radii at the point of tangency.
- The center of the circle is marked, and the radii are drawn from the center to the points of tangency.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The line segment connecting the points on the circumference is a chord of the circle.
- The tangents from the same external point are equal in length.
- The radii are perpendicular to the tangents at the points of tangency.
- The sum of the given arc measures is 315°, which means the remaining arc is 45°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Arc measures: 85° and 230°.
- The sum of the arc measures is 315°, so the remaining arc measure is 45°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 2 \).
- Since the total angle around a point is 360°, the remaining arc measure forms an inscribed angle subtended by the chord.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The circle's properties are represented.
- The relationship between the arc measures and the central angle is captured.
- The remaining arc measure forms an inscribed angle.
