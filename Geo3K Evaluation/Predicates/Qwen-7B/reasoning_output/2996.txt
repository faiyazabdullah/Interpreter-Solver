STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2996
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram P Q R S to find Q P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram PQRS with vertices labeled P, Q, R, S.
- Side QR is marked as 5 units.
- Side PS is marked as 3 units.
- Angle Q is marked as 128 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- PQRS is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
- Adjacent angles sum up to 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of QR = 5 units.
- Length of PS = 3 units.
- Angle Q = 128 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of PQ.
- Since PQRS is a parallelogram, PQ must be equal to RS, and PS must be equal to QR.
- We need to determine PQ using the properties of a parallelogram.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the relationships between them.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
