STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2746
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with vertices A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as \(2x + 5\).
- Side BC is marked as \(3x - 4\).
- Side AC is marked as 27.
- There are no right angle symbols or parallel marks visible.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a general triangle, not necessarily a right triangle.
- No specific geometric relationships are explicitly marked (like right angles or parallelism).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = \(2x + 5\).
- BC = \(3x - 4\).
- AC = 27.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AB.
- To find AB, we need to solve for \(x\) using the given lengths of BC and AC.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the given lengths, and the relationship between them.
- Since no specific relationships (like right angles) are marked, we will focus on the lengths alone.
