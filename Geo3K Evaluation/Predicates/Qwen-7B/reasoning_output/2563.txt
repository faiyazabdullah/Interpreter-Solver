STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2563
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle K J L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram \(JKLM\) with vertices labeled \(J, K, L,\) and \(M\).
- Diagonal \(KL\) intersects \(JM\) at point \(R\).
- Angles \(\angle JRL\) and \(\angle KRL\) are marked as \(30^\circ\) and \(70^\circ\) respectively.
- Sides \(JK\) and \(LM\) are marked as \(2b + 3\) and \(45\).
- Side \(KM\) is marked as \(3a\).
- Side \(KL\) is marked as \(21\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(JKLM\) is a parallelogram.
- Diagonals \(KL\) and \(JM\) bisect each other at point \(R\).
- \(\angle JRL = 30^\circ\) and \(\angle KRL = 70^\circ\).
- Since \(JKLM\) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal (\(JK = LM\) and \(KM = JL\)).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(JK = 2b + 3\)
- \(LM = 45\)
- \(KM = 3a\)
- \(KL = 21\)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle KJL\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram.
- Mark the given lengths and angles.
- Identify the intersection point \(R\) of diagonals.
- Use the properties of the parallelogram to find \(\angle KJL\).
