STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2467
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle N C L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center \( C \).
- Points \( R, M, N, L \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Angles \( \angle RCM \) and \( \angle RMN \) are labeled.
- \( \angle RCM \) is given as \( (x - 1)^\circ \).
- \( \angle RMN \) is given as \( 60^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The points \( R, M, N, \) and \( L \) form chords of the circle.
- The angle subtended by a chord at the center is twice the angle subtended at any point on the remaining part of the circle.
- \( \angle RCM \) and \( \angle RMN \) are inscribed angles that intercept arcs \( RM \) and \( MN \), respectively.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( \angle RCM = (x - 1)^\circ \).
- \( \angle RMN = 60^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle NCL \).
- To find \( m\angle NCL \), we need to understand the relationship between the angles at the center and the inscribed angles.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Define the angles and their relationships.
- Ensure the predicates capture all visible geometric constraints and properties.
