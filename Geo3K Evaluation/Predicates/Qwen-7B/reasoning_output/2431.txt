STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2431
================================================================================
QUESTION: In regular hexagon U V W X Y Z, the side is 12 centimeters long. Find W Y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a regular hexagon with vertices labeled U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- All sides and angles are equal.
- Side length UV is labeled as 12 centimeters.
- The hexagon is marked with a red dashed line indicating symmetry axes.
- There are no right angles, perpendicular lines, or other specific markings indicated in the diagram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The hexagon is a regular polygon, meaning all sides are congruent and all internal angles are equal.
- The hexagon has six equal sides, so UW = VW = WX = XY = YZ = ZU = 12 cm.
- There are no right angles or perpendicular lines explicitly marked in the diagram.
- The symmetry axes imply that the hexagon is symmetric along these lines, but this does not give additional geometric constraints beyond the side lengths being equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The side length of the hexagon is given as 12 cm.
- The question asks for the length of WY, which is a diagonal connecting two opposite vertices of the hexagon.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of WY in a regular hexagon where each side is 12 cm.
- In a regular hexagon, the diagonal connecting two non-adjacent vertices (like WY) is exactly twice the side length due to the properties of a regular hexagon.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the hexagon's properties and the specific measurement required.
- The hexagon's sides are all equal, and the diagonal length is twice the side length.
