STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2857
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find G H in the kite.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a kite with vertices labeled F, G, J, and H.
- The kite is divided into two triangles by the diagonal FG.
- There are two equal lengths marked as 12 units on sides GF and FJ.
- Another diagonal, FH, is marked as 15 units long.
- Points A, G, and J are marked as intersection points where the diagonals intersect.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a kite with diagonals intersecting at point A.
- Diagonal FG divides the kite into two congruent triangles.
- Diagonal FH is the longest diagonal of the kite.
- The kite has two pairs of congruent sides (GF = FJ = 12 units).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of GF = 12 units.
- Length of FJ = 12 units.
- Length of FH = 15 units.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for GH.
- GH is one of the sides of the kite that needs to be determined.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Kite(F,G,J,H)
- LengthOf(Line(G,F)) = 12
- LengthOf(Line(F,J)) = 12
- LengthOf(Line(F,H)) = 15
- LengthOf(Line(H,G)) = GH (to be found)
