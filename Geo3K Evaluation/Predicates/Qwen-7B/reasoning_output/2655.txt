STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2655
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as \( x \).
- Side BC is marked as 13 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 13 units (given)
- AB = \( x \) (unknown)
- AC length is what the question is asking for.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem since it's a right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
