STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2551
================================================================================
QUESTION: If X M = 4, X N = 6, and N Z = 9, find X Y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, Z.
- Side XN is marked as 6 units.
- Side NY is marked as 4 units.
- Side NZ is marked as 9 units.
- Triangle XNY appears to be a right triangle because it has a right angle symbol at vertex N.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XNY is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex N.
- The right angle is marked at vertex N, implying that angle XYN is a right angle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XN = 6
- NY = 4
- NZ = 9

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find XY, where XY is the hypotenuse of the right triangle XNY.
- Since XNY is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find XY.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and the relationship between the sides.
- We will use the Pythagorean theorem to find XY.
