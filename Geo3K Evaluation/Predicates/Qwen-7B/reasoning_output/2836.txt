STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2836
================================================================================
QUESTION: Circles G, J, and K all intersect at L. If G H = 10, find the measure. Find J L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three circles labeled G, J, and K.
- These circles intersect at point L.
- Point L is the intersection of all three circles.
- There is a segment GH labeled with a length of 10 units.
- No other measurements or angles are explicitly labeled in the diagram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Circles G, J, and K intersect at point L.
- This implies that L is the common point of intersection of all three circles.
- There are no other specified relationships between the circles or lines other than their intersection at L.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length GH is explicitly given as 10 units.
- No other lengths or angles are provided.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure JL.
- Given that we have the length of GH and that L is the intersection point of the circles, we need to determine if there is enough information to find JL.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circles and their intersection point.
- We will use the given length GH to infer the relationship between the circles and the segment JL.
