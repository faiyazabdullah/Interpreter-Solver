STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2897
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x in the given parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram JKLN.
- Points J, K, L, and M are labeled.
- Angles JKN and LMN are marked as 75° and 105° respectively.
- The angle at point M is marked as (2x - 1)°.
- Line segments JK, KN, NL, and LM form the sides of the parallelogram.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Parallelogram JKLN has opposite sides parallel and equal lengths.
- JKN and LMN are supplementary angles because they sum up to 180°.
- The sum of angles in a parallelogram is 360°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JKN = 75°
- LMN = 105°
- The angle at point M = (2x - 1)°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of x.
- The sum of angles in parallelogram JKLN must equal 360°.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram and its angles.
- The relationship between the angles must be captured to solve for x.
