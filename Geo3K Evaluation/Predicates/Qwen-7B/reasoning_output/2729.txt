STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2729
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram M N P R to find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram MNRQ with vertices labeled M, N, R, and Q.
- There are several line segments and angles labeled with numerical values or expressions.
- The parallelogram has two pairs of parallel sides, with MN || QR and MR || NQ.
- Angles at vertex M are labeled as 3x - 4 degrees.
- Angles at vertex R are labeled as 38 degrees.
- Other angles are labeled with expressions involving variables like w, y, z.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a parallelogram, implying opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- The sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.
- Angles adjacent to each other add up to 180 degrees due to parallel lines.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of side MN is 3x - 4.
- Length of side QR is 20.
- Length of side NR is 15.4.
- Length of side MR is 17.9.
- Length of side PQ is 11.1.
- Length of side RP is 2y + 5.
- Length of side MQ is 4w - 3.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of x.
- The properties of a parallelogram imply that opposite sides are equal: MN = QR and MR = NR.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the relationships between the lengths.
