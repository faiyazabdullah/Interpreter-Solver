STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2614
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle E F G is equilateral, and E H bisects \angle E. Find m \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle \( \triangle EFG \) with vertices labeled \( E, F, G \).
- Line segment \( EH \) is drawn from vertex \( E \) to a point \( H \) on side \( FG \).
- \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \).
- \( \angle EHF \) is labeled as \( 15x^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle EFG \) is equilateral, meaning all sides and angles are equal.
- Since \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \), \( \angle HEF = \angle HEG \).
- Given \( \angle EHF = 15x^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The question does not provide explicit numerical measurements for sides or angles other than \( 15x^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of \( \angle 2 \).
- Since \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \), \( \angle 2 \) is half of \( \angle E \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the equilateral triangle, angle bisector, and the relationship between angles.
