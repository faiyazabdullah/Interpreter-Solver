REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with various shapes, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Visible elements include triangles, right angles, and parallel lines.
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- Lines: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, GF.
- Angles: ∠A, ∠B, ∠C, ∠D, ∠E, ∠F, ∠G.
- Measurements: Lengths of segments, angles in degrees.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles ABC, CDE, and DEF are present.
- Right angles: ∠BGC, ∠EGF, ∠DFA.
- Angles: ∠A = 51°, ∠E = 25°, ∠B = 28°, ∠C = 35°, ∠D = 4°.
- Parallelism: Line EF || Line CD.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths: |AB| = 3, |BC| = 2, |CD| = 4, |EF| = 1, |DE| = 2.
- Angles in degrees: ∠A = 51°, ∠E = 25°, ∠B = 28°, ∠C = 35°, ∠D = 4°.
- Right angles: ∠BGC, ∠EGF, ∠DFA.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠6.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, right angles, angles, and lengths.
- Capture the relationships between the elements.
