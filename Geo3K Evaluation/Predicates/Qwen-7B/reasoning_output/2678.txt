STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2678
================================================================================
QUESTION: m \angle 2 = 2 x, m \angle 3 = x. Find m \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with several points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Points: A, B, G, J, H, E, F.
- Lines: Line(A,B), Line(B,G), Line(B,J), Line(B,H), Line(B,E), Line(B,F).
- Angles: ∠1, ∠2, ∠3.
- Measurements: ∠2 = 2x, ∠3 = x.
- Special markings: ∠2 and ∠3 are labeled with their respective measures.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure appears to be part of a larger geometric structure involving circles and triangles.
- ∠2 and ∠3 are labeled with their measures.
- ∠2 = 2x and ∠3 = x, implying a relationship between these angles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠2 = 2x
- ∠3 = x

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the measure of ∠2.
- The relationship ∠2 = 2x is already given.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and their measures.
- The predicates will capture the given relationships and measurements.
