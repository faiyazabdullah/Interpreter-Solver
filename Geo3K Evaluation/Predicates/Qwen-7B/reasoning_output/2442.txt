STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2442
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral labeled as ABCD.
- Points A, B, C, and D are marked with red dots.
- Lines AB, BC, CD, and DA are marked with blue arrows.
- Angles at vertices A, B, C, and D are marked with \(x^\circ\).
- Line segment CD appears to be vertical and line segment AB appears to be horizontal.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is likely a rectangle because the lines AB and CD are parallel and horizontal, and BC and AD are also parallel and vertical.
- Angles A, B, C, and D are right angles (\(90^\circ\) each).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurement for \(x^\circ\) is given as \(90^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(x^\circ\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, right angles, and the given measure of \(90^\circ\).
