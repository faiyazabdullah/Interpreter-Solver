STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2479
================================================================================
QUESTION: The two polygons are similar. Find U T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral \(RSUT\) with vertices labeled \(R\), \(S\), \(U\), and \(T\).
- Side \(RS\) is marked as \(x\) meters.
- Side \(ST\) is marked as \(18\) meters.
- Side \(TU\) is marked as \((y+2)\) meters.
- Side \(UR\) is marked as \(y\) meters.
- There are right angle symbols at vertices \(S\) and \(T\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(RSUT\) is a quadrilateral with right angles at vertices \(S\) and \(T\).
- \(RS\) is perpendicular to \(ST\), and \(TU\) is perpendicular to \(UR\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(ST = 18\) meters.
- \(TU = y + 2\) meters.
- \(UR = y\) meters.
- \(RS = x\) meters.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(TU\).
- We need to find the relationship between the sides and use the fact that the quadrilateral has right angles at \(S\) and \(T\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, right angles, lengths, and the relationship between the sides.
