STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2443
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 1.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \(PQR\) with vertices labeled \(P\), \(Q\), \(R\).
- \(PQ\) is perpendicular to \(PR\).
- Angle \(Q\) is labeled as \(51^\circ\).
- Angle \(R\) is labeled as \(33^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(PQR\) is a right triangle with right angle at \(Q\).
- \(PQ\) is perpendicular to \(PR\).
- Angle \(P\) is the remaining angle in the triangle, which can be calculated as \(180^\circ - 51^\circ - 33^\circ = 96^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle \(Q\) is \(51^\circ\).
- The measure of angle \(R\) is \(33^\circ\).
- The measure of angle \(P\) is \(96^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle \(1\), which is angle \(P\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, angles, and relationships.
