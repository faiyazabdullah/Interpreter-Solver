STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2428
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, a regular polygon is inscribed in a circle. Find the measure of a central angle.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle.
- The hexagon has vertices labeled J, K, L, M, N, and P.
- The circle is centered at R, which is also the center of the hexagon.
- The hexagon is circumscribed around the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The hexagon is a regular polygon, meaning all its sides and angles are equal.
- The center of the hexagon is the same as the center of the circumscribed circle.
- The hexagon divides the circle into six equal arcs.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Since it's a regular hexagon, each interior angle is 120 degrees.
- Each arc subtended by each side of the hexagon is 60 degrees because the circle is divided into six equal parts.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of a central angle of the hexagon.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the regular hexagon and its relationship with the circle.
