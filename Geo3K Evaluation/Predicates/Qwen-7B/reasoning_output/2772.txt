STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2772
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \widehat X Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral XYZW with vertices labeled X, Y, Z, W.
- Points X and Z lie on the circumference of a circle centered at C.
- Angles XYZ and XYZ are labeled.
- Angle XYZ is 68°.
- Angle WZY is labeled as 224°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since XYZW is a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum up to 180°.
- Angle WZY and angle WXY are supplementary angles because they are adjacent to the same arc WZY.
- The sum of angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is 360°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle XYZ = 68°.
- Angle WZY = 224°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle XZ.
- To find angle XZ, we need to use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals where opposite angles sum to 180°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral and its properties.
- The relationships between the angles need to be captured.
