STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2924
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find \cos C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 3 units
- Side BC is marked as 5 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 3 units (given)
- BC = 5 units (given)
- AC length is what we need to find

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for cos C
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle
- We need to determine the length of AC and then use trigonometric relationships

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
