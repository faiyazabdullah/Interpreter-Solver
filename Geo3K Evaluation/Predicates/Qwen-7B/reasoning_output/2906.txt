STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2906
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral A B C D is a rectangle. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Angles at A and D are marked as (2x + 1)° and (3y + 10)° respectively.
- Angles at B and C are marked as (y²)° and (5x + 5)° respectively.
- The figure indicates that ABCD is a rectangle, implying right angles at A, B, C, and D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, all four angles at A, B, C, and D are right angles.
- Therefore, the angles at A and D should sum up to 180°, and the angles at B and C should also sum up to 180°.
- This implies that (2x + 1) + (5x + 5) = 180 and (y²) + (3y + 10) = 180.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- From the given angles, we have two equations:
  - For angle at A: \(2x + 1 + 5x + 5 = 180\)
  - For angle at B: \(y^2 + 3y + 10 = 180\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to express the relationships from the angle measurements.
- We will use the equations derived from the angle sum property of the rectangle.
