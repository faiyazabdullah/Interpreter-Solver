STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2937
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 9 units.
- Side \( AC \) is marked as 15 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( C \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( C \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 9 \) units (given)
- \( AC = 15 \) units (given)
- \( BC = x \) units (unknown)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BC \).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem to find \( BC \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
