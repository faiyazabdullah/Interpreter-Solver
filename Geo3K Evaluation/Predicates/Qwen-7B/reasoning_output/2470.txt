STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2470
================================================================================
QUESTION: In rhombus L M P Q, m \angle Q L M = 2 x^ { 2 } - 10, m \angle Q P M = 8 x, and M P = 10. Find the perimeter of L M P Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus \( LM PQ \).
- Points \( L \), \( M \), \( P \), and \( Q \) form the vertices of the rhombus.
- \( MP = 10 \).
- \( \angle QLM = 2x^2 - 10 \).
- \( \angle QPM = 8x \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( LM PQ \) is a rhombus, meaning all sides are equal and opposite angles are equal.
- Since it's a rhombus, \( \angle QLM = \angle QPM \).
- Given \( \angle QLM = 2x^2 - 10 \) and \( \angle QPM = 8x \), we can set up the equation:
  \[
  2x^2 - 10 = 8x
  \]
- Solving this quadratic equation will give us the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( MP = 10 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of \( LM PQ \).
- Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, the perimeter \( P \) can be calculated as:
  \[
  P = 4 \times MP
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, its sides, and the given measurements.
