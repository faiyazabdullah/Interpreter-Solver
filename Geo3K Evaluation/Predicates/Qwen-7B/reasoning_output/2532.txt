================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a diameter AB.
- Points A, B, C, and D are labeled inside the circle.
- Angles ∠CAD and ∠BAD are marked with specific measures.
- The measure of ∠CAD is given as 150°.
- The measure of ∠BAD is given as 85°.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AB is the diameter of the circle, it implies that ∠ACB is a right angle (∠ACB = 90°).
- The sum of angles around point A is 360°.
- Therefore, ∠CAD + ∠BAD + ∠ACB + ∠BCD = 360°.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given ∠CAD = 150°.
- Given ∠BAD = 85°.
- ∠ACB = 90° (since AB is the diameter).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find ∠BCD.
- We need to use the sum of angles around point A to find ∠BCD.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, its diameter, and the angles involved.
- Capture the sum of angles around point A.
