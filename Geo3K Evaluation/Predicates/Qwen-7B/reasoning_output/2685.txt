STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2685
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram PQRS with vertices labeled Q, R, S, and P.
- Lines QR and PS are marked as parallel.
- Line QT is marked as perpendicular to line PR.
- Line RT is marked as congruent to line PT.
- The lengths of segments are labeled as \(5y\) for segment QT and \(2y + 12\) for segment PS.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral PQRS is a parallelogram because opposite sides are parallel.
- Segments QT and RT are congruent because they are marked with the same symbol.
- Segments QT and RT are perpendicular to segment PR because they are marked with perpendicular symbols.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of segment QT is \(5y\).
- Length of segment PS is \(2y + 12\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(y\) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- Since PQRS is already identified as a parallelogram, we need to ensure the lengths of the opposite sides are equal.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, the lengths of the segments, and the relationship between them.
