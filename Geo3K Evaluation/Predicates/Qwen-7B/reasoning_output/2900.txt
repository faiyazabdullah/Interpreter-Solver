STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2900
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the triangle. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 5 inches
- Side AC is marked as 5 inches
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 5 inches (given)
- AC = 5 inches (given)
- BC length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of BC
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle
- The problem involves finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
