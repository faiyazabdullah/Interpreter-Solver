STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2430
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find X Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a right triangle WYZ with vertices labeled W, Y, Z.
- Side WY is marked as \(18 + 2y\).
- Side WZ is marked as \(5y - 6\).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex W.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle WYZ is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex W.
- Sides WY and WZ are perpendicular.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WY = \(18 + 2y\)
- WZ = \(5y - 6\)
- The question asks for the length of WZ.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of WZ.
- This requires using the geometric relationships in the right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
