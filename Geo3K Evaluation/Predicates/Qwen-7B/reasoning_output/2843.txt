STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2843
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle L M N \cong \triangle Q R S. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two triangles, \(\triangle LMN\) and \(\triangle QRQ\).
- The triangles are congruent (\(\triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRQ\)).
- Angles \( \angle LMN \) and \( \angle QRQ \) have expressions \( (y + 6)^\circ \) and \( (2y - 12)^\circ \) respectively.
- Angles \( \angle MNL \) and \( \angle RQS \) are both \( 90^\circ \).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the triangles are congruent, corresponding angles are equal.
- Therefore, \( (y + 6)^\circ = (2y - 12)^\circ \).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The equation from the angles is the key measurement relationship.
- We need to find the value of \( y \) that satisfies the equality.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- From the image, there are no direct measurements involving \( x \). The angles and sides suggest that \( x \) might be part of the linear expressions related to the lengths of segments \( LM \) and \( QR \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the congruence of the triangles.
- Represent the equality of the angles.
- Ensure the predicates capture the geometric constraints and properties visible in the diagram.
