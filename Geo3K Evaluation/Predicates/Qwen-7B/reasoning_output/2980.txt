STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2980
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the length of \widehat Z Y. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center X.
- There is a central angle labeled as 75°.
- There are two radii: one connecting X to Y and the other connecting X to Z.
- The length of the radius XY is given as 6 inches.
- The point X is the center of the circle.
- Points Y and Z lie on the circumference of the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure represents a circle with a central angle.
- The central angle XYZ measures 75°.
- The radii XY and XZ have equal lengths of 6 inches.
- Points Y and Z are on the circumference of the circle centered at X.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius length is 6 inches.
- The angle XYZ is 75°.
- The arc length ZY is related to the central angle and the radius.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of the arc ZY.
- To find the arc length, we need the formula for the arc length of a circle, which is \( \text{arc length} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r \).
- Here, \( \theta = 75^\circ \) and \( r = 6 \) inches.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, central angle, radius, and arc length.
- Must include the relationship between the central angle and the arc length.
