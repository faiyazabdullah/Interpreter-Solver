STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2598
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of \triangle R U W if \triangle R U W \sim \triangle S T V, S T = 24, V S = 12, V T = 18 and U W = 21.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two triangles: \(\triangle R U W\) and \(\triangle S T V\).
- Points \(R, S, T, U, V, W\) are labeled.
- Lines \(R U, U W, W V, V T, T S, S R\) are drawn.
- Triangles \(\triangle R U W\) and \(\triangle S T V\) appear similar due to the given lengths and angles.
- Measurements: \(S T = 24\), \(V S = 12\), \(V T = 18\), and \(U W = 21\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles \(\triangle R U W\) and \(\triangle S T V\) are similar (\(\triangle R U W \sim \triangle S T V\)).
- The corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.
- Since \(\triangle R U W\) is similar to \(\triangle S T V\), the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths: \(S T = 24\), \(V S = 12\), \(V T = 18\), and \(U W = 21\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of \(\triangle R U W\).
- To find the perimeter, we need to determine the lengths of sides \(R U\) and \(W V\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the similarity of triangles.
- Represent the proportional relationships of the sides.
- Calculate the perimeter of \(\triangle R U W\).
