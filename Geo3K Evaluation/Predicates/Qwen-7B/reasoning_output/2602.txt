STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2602
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Vertex \( A \) is at the right angle.
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( x^\circ \).
- Side \( AC \) is marked as \( (2x)^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
- Side \( AB \) forms one of the legs of the right triangle.
- Side \( AC \) forms the other leg of the right triangle.
- Side \( BC \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = x^\circ \).
- \( AC = (2x)^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, and the relationship between the sides.
