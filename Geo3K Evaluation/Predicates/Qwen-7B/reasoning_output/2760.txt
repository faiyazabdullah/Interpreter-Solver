STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2760
================================================================================
QUESTION: Circle A has diameters D F and P G. If D F = 10, find D A.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle labeled as Circle(A).
- Two diameters are shown: DF and PG.
- The length of DF is given as 10.
- The center of the circle is point A.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- DF and PG are diameters of Circle(A).
- Since DF is a diameter, it passes through the center A and has its endpoints D and F on the circumference.
- The length of DF is 10.
- The center A is equidistant from all points on the circumference.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of DF is given as 10.
- Since DF is a diameter, the radius of the circle is half of the diameter.
- Therefore, the radius of Circle(A) is \( \frac{DF}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find DA.
- Since DA is a radius of the circle, and the radius of the circle is 5, DA = 5.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the diameter, the radius, and the relationship between the diameter and the radius.
- Must include the given length of the diameter and the calculated radius.
