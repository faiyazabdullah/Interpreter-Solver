STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2733
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AC is marked as 12 units
- Side AB is marked as x°
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular
- Side AC is the hypotenuse
- Angle A is labeled as x°

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = x° (angle measurement)
- BC = 12 units (given)
- AC length is marked as 12 units

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle
- The problem involves finding the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one side is given and the other is an angle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
