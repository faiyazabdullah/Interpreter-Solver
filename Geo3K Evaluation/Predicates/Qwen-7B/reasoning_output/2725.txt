STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2725
================================================================================
QUESTION: The diameters of \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C are 10, 30 and 10 units, respectively. Find Y W if A Z \cong C W and C W = 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three circles \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), and \(\odot C\) with diameters of 10, 30, and 10 units, respectively.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) lie on their respective circles.
- Points \(E\), \(Z\), \(X\), \(B\), \(Y\), \(W\), and \(C\) are marked on the circles.
- The segments \(AZ\), \(BW\), and \(CW\) are given as congruent (\(AZ \cong CW\)).
- Segment \(CW\) is explicitly marked as 2 units long.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The diameters of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) are both 10 units, and the diameter of \(\odot B\) is 30 units.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are equidistant from their respective centers due to the congruence of the diameters.
- Segments \(AZ\), \(BW\), and \(CW\) are congruent.
- Segment \(CW\) is explicitly marked as 2 units long.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The diameter of \(\odot A\) is 10 units.
- The diameter of \(\odot C\) is 10 units.
- The diameter of \(\odot B\) is 30 units.
- \(AZ = CW\) and \(CW = 2\) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(YW\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circles, diameters, congruences, and the length of \(CW\).
- We will also need to represent the congruence of \(AZ\) and \(CW\).
