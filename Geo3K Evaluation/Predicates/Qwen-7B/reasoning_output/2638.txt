STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2638
================================================================================
QUESTION: \triangle K L N and \triangle L M N are isosceles and m \angle J K N = 130. Find the measure of \angle J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with points \(K\), \(J\), \(L\), \(N\), \(M\), and \(P\).
- There are triangles \(\triangle KLN\) and \(\triangle LMN\).
- \(\triangle KLN\) is isosceles with \(m\angle JKN = 130^\circ\).
- \(\triangle LMN\) is also isosceles.
- Angles at point \(L\) are labeled as \(25^\circ\), \(18^\circ\), and \(20^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\triangle KLN\) and \(\triangle LMN\) are both isosceles triangles.
- The sum of angles in \(\triangle KLN\) is \(180^\circ\).
- The sum of angles in \(\triangle LMN\) is \(180^\circ\).
- \(\angle JKN = 130^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measures of angles at point \(L\) are given as \(25^\circ\), \(18^\circ\), and \(20^\circ\).
- The angle \(\angle JKN\) is explicitly stated as \(130^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle J\).
- The angle \(\angle J\) is part of \(\triangle KJN\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the isosceles triangles.
- Capture the given angles and relationships.
