STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2613
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with two intersecting circles, labeled as Circle(A) and Circle($).
- Points A, C, D, and E are marked on the circles.
- Angles are labeled as Angle(A), Angle(1), and Angle($).
- There is a specific measurement indicated for Angle(1): (x + 2.5)°.
- Another measurement is given for Angle($): (4x + 5)°.
- There is also a labeled angle at point D: 50°.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure involves circles and angles.
- Angle(1) is part of Circle(A).
- Angle($) is part of Circle($).
- Angle(D) is marked at point D within the intersection of the circles.
- The angles appear to be related to the arcs they subtend on the circles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle(1) has a measurement of (x + 2.5)°.
- Angle($) has a measurement of (4x + 5)°.
- Angle(D) has a measurement of 50°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of x.
- To solve for x, we need to use the relationship between the angles on the circles.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circles and the angles.
- We will capture the given measurements and the relationship between them.
