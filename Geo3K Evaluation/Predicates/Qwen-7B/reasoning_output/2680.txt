STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2680
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 4.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center F.
- Points R, U, S, T are on the circumference of the circle.
- Lines RS, RT, RU, SU are chords of the circle.
- Angles RUS and TUS are given as 92째 and 51째 respectively.
- Point F is the intersection of the chords RS and RT.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- RS and RT are chords of the circle intersecting at point F.
- RUS and TUS are inscribed angles subtended by the same arc RUT.
- The measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle RUS = 92째
- Angle TUS = 51째
- We need to find the measure of angle 4, which is the arc RUT intercepted by the inscribed angles RUS and TUS.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 4.
- Angle 4 is the arc RUT intercepted by the inscribed angles RUS and TUS.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points on the circle, chords, and inscribed angles.
- Must include the given angles and the relationship between them and the intercepted arc.
