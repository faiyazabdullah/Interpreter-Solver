STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2451
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle R.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle RQS with vertices labeled R, Q, and S.
- Side QR is marked as 18 units.
- Side QS is marked as 23 units.
- Side RS is marked as 37 units.
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks indicated.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RQS is a triangle with sides QR, QS, and RS.
- There are no specific geometric relationships such as parallelism or perpendicularity implied by the figure.
- No angles are marked or labeled in the diagram.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- QR = 18 units (given)
- QS = 23 units (given)
- RS = 37 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle R.
- This requires knowing the type of triangle or applying the Law of Cosines if necessary to find the cosine of angle R.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle and its sides.
- Must include the lengths of the sides but not the angle measure since we do not have enough information to calculate it from the given data.
