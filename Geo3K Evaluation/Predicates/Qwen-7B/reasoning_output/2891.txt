STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2891
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot B, C E = 13.5. Find B D. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a circle with center \( B \).
- Points \( C \) and \( E \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Point \( D \) lies on the diameter \( CE \).
- The segment \( CE \) is marked as 13.5 units.
- Line \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( CE \) and intersects it at point \( D \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( CE \) is a chord of the circle.
- \( BD \) is a perpendicular from the center \( B \) to the chord \( CE \).
- By the perpendicular bisector theorem, \( BD \) bisects \( CE \) at \( D \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( CE = 13.5 \) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( BD \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, its center, points on the circle, and the relationship between the chord and the radius.
