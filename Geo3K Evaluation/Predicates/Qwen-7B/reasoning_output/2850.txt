STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2850
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral E F G H is a rectangle. If E F = 4 x - 6 and H G = x + 3, find E F.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle \( EFGH \) with vertices labeled \( E, F, G, H \).
- \( EF = 4x - 6 \).
- \( HG = x + 3 \).
- All sides of the rectangle are perpendicular and parallel to each other.
- No right angle symbols are explicitly shown, but since it is a rectangle, we infer that all interior angles are right angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \( EFGH \) is a rectangle.
- \( EF \) is parallel to \( HG \).
- \( EH \) is parallel to \( FG \).
- \( EF = HG \) and \( EH = FG \).
- \( \angle EHF = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( EF = 4x - 6 \).
- \( HG = x + 3 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \( EF \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle and the given lengths.
- Ensure all necessary geometric properties are included.
