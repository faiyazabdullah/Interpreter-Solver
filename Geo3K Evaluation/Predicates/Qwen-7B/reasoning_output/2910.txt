================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( z \).
- Side \( BC \) is marked as \( 6x \).
- Side \( AC \) is marked as \( y \).
- There are right angle symbols at vertex \( B \) and vertex \( D \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Side \( AB \) is perpendicular to side \( BC \).
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side \( AB = z \).
- Side \( BC = 6x \).
- Side \( AC = y \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, lengths of sides, and the relationship between them.
