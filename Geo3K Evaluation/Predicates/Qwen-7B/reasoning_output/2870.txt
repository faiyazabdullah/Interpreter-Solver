STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2870
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Lines AD, DC, CB, BA form the quadrilateral.
- Angles ∠A, ∠B, ∠C, ∠D are labeled.
- ∠A = 95°, ∠B = 24°, ∠C = 109°, and ∠D is unlabeled.
- Side AB has length 2.
- Side BC has length 3.
- Side CD has length 24.
- Side DA has length 1.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral because opposite angles sum up to 180°.
- ∠A + ∠C = 95° + 109° = 204° ≠ 180°, so it's not a cyclic quadrilateral.
- No parallel lines or perpendicular lines are explicitly marked.
- No specific geometric relationships like congruence or similarity are indicated.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2
- BC = 3
- CD = 24
- DA = 1
- No other lengths are given.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠2.
- ∠2 is part of triangle ADE where ∠DAE = 33°.
- We need to find the measure of ∠2 using the fact that the sum of angles in triangle ADE is 180°.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, angles, sides, and relationships within triangle ADE.
- Must include the given measurements and the properties of triangles.
