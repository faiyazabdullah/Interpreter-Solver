STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2534
================================================================================
QUESTION: E B \parallel D C. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Line segment \(EB\) is parallel to line segment \(DC\).
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AD = 4\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(DA = x - 2\)

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(EB \parallel DC\): This implies that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AB \parallel CD\) (since \(EB\) being parallel to \(DC\) suggests a trapezoid).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(AD = 4\)
- \(DA = x - 2\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the trapezoid, its sides, and the relationship between them.
- We will use the given measurements and the property that the trapezoid's non-parallel sides are equal.
