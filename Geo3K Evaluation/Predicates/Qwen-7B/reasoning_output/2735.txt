STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2735
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the trapezoid.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Side AD is marked as 16 feet.
- Side BC is marked as 6 feet.
- Line segment BE is perpendicular to AD and BC.
- Side BE is marked as 12 feet.
- There are right angle symbols at point E, indicating that BE is perpendicular to AD.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid ABCD with AD || BC.
- BE ⊥ AD and BE ⊥ BC.
- BE = 12 feet.
- AD = 16 feet.
- BC = 6 feet.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 16 feet (given).
- BC = 6 feet (given).
- BE = 12 feet (given).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of trapezoid ABCD.
- This requires using the formula for the area of a trapezoid.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, lengths, and the perpendicular distance.
