STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2582
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find P N.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram MNPB with vertices labeled M, N, P, B.
- Side MP is marked as \(25^\circ\).
- Side PN is marked as \(3x + 6\).
- Side MB is marked as \(4x - 2\).
- Angle MNB is marked as \(25^\circ\).
- There are right angle symbols at the intersections of lines ML and MP, as well as NL and NP.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral MNPB is a parallelogram due to opposite sides being equal and parallel.
- Angles MNB and MPN are both \(25^\circ\) because they are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal NB intersecting the parallel lines MP and PB.
- Right angles are formed at L and N, implying that lines ML and NL are perpendicular to lines MP and NP respectively.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of MP is \(25^\circ\) (angle measure, not a linear measurement).
- Length of PN is \(3x + 6\).
- Length of MB is \(4x - 2\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of PN.
- PN is one of the sides of the parallelogram, and its length is expressed as \(3x + 6\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, right angles, and the given measurements.
