STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2816
================================================================================
QUESTION: In R S T V, R S = 6, V T = 3 and R X is twice the length of X V. Find X Y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a quadrilateral \(RSVT\) with vertices labeled \(R\), \(S\), \(T\), and \(V\).
- Lines \(RS\) and \(VT\) are marked with lengths \(6\) and \(3\) respectively.
- Line \(RX\) is marked with a red arrow pointing towards \(X\), indicating it extends from \(R\) to \(X\).
- Line \(XY\) is marked with a blue arrow pointing towards \(Y\), indicating it extends from \(X\) to \(Y\).
- The diagram includes a right angle symbol at vertex \(T\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral \(RSVT\) appears to be a rectangle because opposite sides are equal and there is a right angle at \(T\).
- \(RS = 6\) and \(VT = 3\).
- \(RX\) is twice the length of \(XV\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(RS = 6\)
- \(VT = 3\)
- \(RX\) is twice the length of \(XV\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(XY\).
- Given the relationship between \(RX\) and \(XV\), we need to find the length of \(XY\) in the context of the rectangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral as a rectangle.
- We need to express the relationships between the lengths given and the unknown length \(XY\).
