STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2905
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y. Round to the nearest tenth, if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \(P\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) lie on the circle.
- Line segment \(AB\) is drawn from point \(A\) to point \(B\) inside the circle.
- The length of \(AB\) is given as 10.
- The length of \(BC\) is given as 6.
- The point \(M\) lies on the extension of \(AB\) outside the circle.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are collinear.
- Segment \(AB\) is part of a larger line segment extending through \(M\).
- Segment \(BC\) is a chord of the circle.
- The length \(y\) represents the distance from point \(B\) to the point where \(AB\) extends beyond the circle to point \(M\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length \(AB = 10\)
- Length \(BC = 6\)
- Length \(y\) needs to be determined.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(y\).
- Since the problem involves a circle and segments, the key relationship here is the total length of the extended segment \(AM\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the line segment, and the length relationships.
