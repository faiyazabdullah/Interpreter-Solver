STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2849
================================================================================
QUESTION: m \angle 4 = 2 y + 32 and m \angle 5 = 3 y - 3. Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with several points, lines, and angles.
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- Lines: m, n, p, q, r.
- Angles: ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, ∠4, ∠5, ∠6, ∠7, ∠8.
- Special markings: Right angle symbols at ∠2 and ∠6.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC with right angles at ∠2 and ∠6.
- Parallel lines: m || n, p || q.
- Bisectors of angles ∠4 and ∠5.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠4 = 2y + 32°.
- ∠5 = 3y - 3°.
- ∠4 and ∠5 are related through a geometric relationship.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of y.
- The relationship between ∠4 and ∠5 is crucial to solve this problem.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and the right angles.
- Capture the parallel lines and bisectors.
- Capture the given angle equations to solve for y.
