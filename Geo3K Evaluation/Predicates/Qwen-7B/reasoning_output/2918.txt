STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2918
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that G J \parallel F K. G H = x + 3.5, H J = x - 8.5, F H = 21, H K = 7.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with a triangle \( \triangle HGIK \).
- Points \( G \), \( H \), \( I \), and \( K \) are labeled.
- \( GH \) is marked with the label \( x + 3.5 \).
- \( HJ \) is marked with the label \( x - 8.5 \).
- \( FH = 21 \).
- \( HK = 7 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( GH \parallel FK \) because the question specifies \( GJ \parallel FK \).
- Since \( GJ \parallel FK \) and \( HJ \) is a transversal intersecting both parallel lines, we can use the properties of corresponding angles.
- \( HJ = x - 8.5 \) and \( FK = FH + HK = 21 + 7 = 28 \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - \( FH = 21 \)
  - \( HK = 7 \)
  - \( GH = x + 3.5 \)
  - \( HJ = x - 8.5 \)
- We need to find \( x \) such that \( GJ \parallel FK \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \( x \) so that \( GJ \parallel FK \).
- Since \( GJ \parallel FK \), triangles \( \triangle GHJ \) and \( \triangle FHK \) are similar by AA similarity criterion.
- Using the similarity ratio, we set up the proportion:
  \[
  \frac{GH}{FH} = \frac{HJ}{HK}
  \]

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the lengths and similarity condition.
