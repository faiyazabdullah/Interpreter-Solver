STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2656
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Side \(AD\) is marked as 13 yards.
- Side \(DC\) is marked as 10 yards.
- A vertical dashed line \(DE\) is drawn from point \(D\) to point \(E\) on side \(BC\), forming a right angle at \(E\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure has a right triangle \(BCE\) within the parallelogram, where \(\angle BEC = 45^\circ\).
- \(DE\) is perpendicular to \(BC\), making \(\angle DEB = 90^\circ\).
- \(AD\) and \(BC\) are parallel sides of the parallelogram.
- \(AB\) and \(DC\) are also parallel sides of the parallelogram.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AD = 13\) yards.
- \(DC = 10\) yards.
- \(BC\) is the same as \(AD\) because opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
- Since \(\angle BEC = 45^\circ\), triangle \(BCE\) is a 45-45-90 triangle, meaning \(BE = EC\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- The area of a parallelogram is given by \( \text{base} \times \text{height} \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the right triangle formed within it.
- Must include the given lengths and the relationship between them.
