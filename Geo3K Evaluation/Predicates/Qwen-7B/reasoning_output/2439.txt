STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2439
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle R S T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T
- Angle RST is marked as 70 degrees
- There are no other angles explicitly labeled
- No other special markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruent segments are visible

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RST is not specified as having any special properties (e.g., right triangle, isosceles triangle)
- No parallel lines, right angles, or congruence are indicated
- No additional relationships or constraints are apparent from the diagram

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle RST = 70 degrees (given)
- No other numerical measurements are provided

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle RST
- Since there are no other angles provided in the triangle, angle RST is the only angle whose measure is known.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the angle, and its measurement
- Must include the angle's measure as the only numerical property visible
