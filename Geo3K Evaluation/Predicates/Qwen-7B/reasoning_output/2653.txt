STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2653
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 6 if m \angle 1 = 30.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle labeled WXZY.
- The vertices are labeled as W, X, Y, and Z.
- Angles 1 through 12 are marked within the rectangle.
- Right angle symbols are present at angles 6 and 12.
- Visible lengths include:
  - WX = 8
  - WY = 7
  - XZ = 1
  - YZ = 2
  - WX = XY = 5
  - XZ = ZY = 4

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXZY is a rectangle.
- Angles 6 and 12 are right angles.
- Angles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are interior angles of the rectangle.
- Angles 6 and 12 are supplementary to angles 5 and 11 respectively because they form linear pairs.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 8
- WY = 7
- XZ = 1
- YZ = 2
- WX = XY = 5
- XZ = ZY = 4

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 6 if \( m\angle 1 = 30^\circ \).
- Since WXZY is a rectangle, opposite angles are equal.
- Since WXZY is a rectangle, adjacent angles are supplementary.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
