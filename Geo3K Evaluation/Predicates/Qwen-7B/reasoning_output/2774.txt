STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2774
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle NOP with vertices labeled N, O, P
- Side ON is marked as \(x\) units
- Side OP is marked as \(20\sqrt{2}\) units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex O

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle NOP is a right triangle with right angle at vertex O
- Sides ON and OP are perpendicular
- Side NP is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ON length is \(x\) units (variable)
- OP length is \(20\sqrt{2}\) units (given)
- NP length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of ON (\(x\))
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side length

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
