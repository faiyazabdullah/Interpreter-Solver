STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2647
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that m \parallel n.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two parallel lines labeled as \(m\) and \(n\).
- Two angles are marked: one is \(4x - 23\) degrees, and the other is \(2x + 17\) degrees.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) are marked, connecting lines and angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines \(m\) and \(n\) are parallel.
- Angles \(ABE\) and \(BEC\) are formed by transversal \(BE\) intersecting lines \(m\) and \(n\).
- Since \(m \parallel n\), corresponding angles and alternate interior angles will have equal measures.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles \(ABE\) and \(BEC\) are given as \(4x - 23\) degrees and \(2x + 17\) degrees respectively.
- These angles are supplementary because they form a straight line along \(BE\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(x\) such that \(m \parallel n\).
- Since \(m \parallel n\), the corresponding angles and alternate interior angles are equal. Thus, the sum of these angles should be \(180^\circ\) (since they are adjacent).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallel lines and the supplementary relationship between the angles.
