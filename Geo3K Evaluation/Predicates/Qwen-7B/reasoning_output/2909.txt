STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2909
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 1.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, Z
- Angles at vertices X, Y, and Z are labeled as 105°, 24°, and 23° respectively
- Line XY, YZ, and ZX are the sides of the triangle
- There are no special markings like right angles or parallel lines

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is a triangle with known internal angles
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle X = 105°
- Angle Y = 24°
- Angle Z = 23°

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1, which is typically interpreted as angle YZX in the context of the given diagram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle and its angles
- Must include the given angles and their relationships within the triangle
