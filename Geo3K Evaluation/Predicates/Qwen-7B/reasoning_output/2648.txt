STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2648
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center O.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F lie on the circle.
- Angle ADE is a right angle (90 degrees).
- Angle ACD is labeled as 67 degrees.
- Angle BAC is marked as \(x\) degrees.
- Line segments AD, BD, and CD are radii of the circle.
- Line segments AB, BC, and AC form a triangle.
- Right angle symbol at point A.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at A.
- Triangle ACD is also a right triangle with right angle at A.
- Triangles ABD and ACD share common side AD.
- Line segments AD, BD, and CD are radii of the circle.
- Angle BAC is the angle we need to find.
- Since triangles ABD and ACD are right triangles, angle BAC is the sum of angles BAD and CAD.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ACD is 67 degrees.
- Since angle ADE is a right angle (90 degrees), angle ADB is also a right angle (90 degrees).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of angle BAC (\(x\)).
- We know that angle ACD = 67 degrees.
- Since triangles ABD and ACD are right triangles, angle BAC = angle BAD + angle CAD.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, right angles, and the relationship between angles.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
