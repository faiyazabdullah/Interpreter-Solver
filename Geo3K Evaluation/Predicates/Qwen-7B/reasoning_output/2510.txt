STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2510
================================================================================
QUESTION: Circle J has a radius of 10 units, \odot K has a radius of 8 units, and B C = 5.4 units. Find J K.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two circles, Circle J and Circle K, with centers at J and K respectively.
- Circle J has a radius of 10 units.
- Circle K has a radius of 8 units.
- Points B and C lie on both circles.
- The distance between points B and C is given as 5.4 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both circles intersect at points B and C.
- Points B and C are equidistant from the centers of both circles.
- The distance between the centers of the two circles (J and K) is the sum of their radii minus the given distance between points B and C.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of Circle J = 10 units.
- Radius of Circle K = 8 units.
- BC = 5.4 units.
- We need to find JK, the distance between the centers of the two circles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of JK.
- To find JK, we use the relationship involving the radii of the circles and the distance between their points of intersection.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circles, their radii, the distance between points B and C, and the distance between the centers J and K.
