STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2410
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find C D if A C = x - 3, B E = 20, A B = 16, and C D = x + 5.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a pentagon labeled A, B, C, D, E with vertices connected by lines.
- Side AB is marked as 16 units.
- Side BE is marked as 20 units.
- Side CD is marked as \( x + 5 \).
- Side AC is marked as \( x - 3 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure shows a pentagon with vertices A, B, C, D, and E.
- No specific geometric relationships are marked (e.g., parallelism, perpendicularity, congruence).
- No right angles or specific angles are indicated.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - \( AB = 16 \)
  - \( BE = 20 \)
  - \( CD = x + 5 \)
  - \( AC = x - 3 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( CD \) given the expressions for \( AC \) and \( CD \).
- No further geometric relationships or constraints are provided from the diagram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the pentagon and its sides.
- Must include the given lengths and the relationship between them.
