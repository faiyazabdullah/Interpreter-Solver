STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2956
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Lines AB and CD are marked as parallel.
- Lines AD and BC are marked as equal in length.
- Angle E is marked as a right angle.
- Side lengths AB = 5, BC = 8, and CD = 10 are provided.
- Point E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD has parallel sides AB || CD.
- Quadrilateral ABCD has equal sides AD = BC.
- Angle E forms a right angle at the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.
- Triangles ABE and CDE share angle E and have equal legs due to the right angle at E and equal sides AB = CD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 5 units.
- BC = 8 units.
- CD = 10 units.
- No direct measurement for AD or diagonal lengths are given.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AB, which is already provided as 5 units.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, right angle, parallel sides, equal sides, and given lengths.
