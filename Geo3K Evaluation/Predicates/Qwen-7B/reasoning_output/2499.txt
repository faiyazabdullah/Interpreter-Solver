STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2499
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 7 units.
- Side BC is marked as \( y \).
- Side AC is marked as \( x \).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 7 units (given).
- BC = \( y \) units (unknown).
- AC = \( x \) units (unknown).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( x \).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle ABC is a right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and the relationship between sides using the Pythagorean theorem.
