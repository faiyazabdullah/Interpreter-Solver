STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2458
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle C F D on \odot F with diameter A C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle with center \(F\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Angles \(\angle AFB\) and \(\angle AFD\) are labeled as \(72^\circ\) and \(4a - 1\) respectively.
- Angle \(\angle CAD\) is labeled as \(2a - 5\) degrees.
- The goal is to find the measure of \(\angle CFD\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum up to \(180^\circ\).
- \(\angle AFB + \angle AFD = 180^\circ\).
- \(\angle CFD\) is an internal angle of the cyclic quadrilateral formed by points \(C\), \(F\), and \(D\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle AFB = 72^\circ\)
- \(\angle AFD = 4a - 1\) degrees
- \(\angle CAD = 2a - 5\) degrees

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find \(\angle CFD\).
- The key relationship here is the sum of angles around point \(F\) in the cyclic quadrilateral.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the cyclic quadrilateral and its angles.
- Ensure all visible information and constraints are captured.
