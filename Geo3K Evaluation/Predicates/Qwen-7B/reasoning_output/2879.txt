STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2879
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 10 units.
- Side \( AC \) is marked as 20 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 10 \) units (given)
- \( AC = 20 \) units (given)
- \( BC \) is what the question is asking for.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BC \).
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle.
- The problem involves finding the missing side of a right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
