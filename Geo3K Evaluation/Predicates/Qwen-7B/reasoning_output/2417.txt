STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2417
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot P, the radius is 2 inches, find the length of \widehat R S. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at point \(P\) with a radius of 2 inches.
- Points \(R\), \(S\), \(T\), and \(Q\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Angles \(\angle PRS = 130^\circ\) and \(\angle PQS = 112^\circ\) are given.
- The goal is to find the length of the arc \(\widehat{RS}\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a circle with a central angle \(\angle PRS = 130^\circ\).
- The angle \(\angle PQS = 112^\circ\) is also provided.
- The arc \(\widehat{RS}\) subtends the central angle \(\angle PRS\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle \(P\) is 2 inches.
- The central angle \(\angle PRS = 130^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of the arc \(\widehat{RS}\).
- The formula for the length of an arc is given by:
  \[
  \text{Arc Length} = 2\pi r \cdot \frac{\theta}{360^\circ}
  \]
  where \(r\) is the radius and \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, the radius, the central angle, and the arc length.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties related to the circle and the arc.
