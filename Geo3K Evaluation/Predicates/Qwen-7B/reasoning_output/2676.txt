STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2676
================================================================================
QUESTION: M N \parallel B C. Solve for x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( 4x - 6 \).
- Side \( BC \) is marked as \( 24 \).
- Side \( AC \) is marked as \( 3x - 2 \).
- Side \( AB \) appears to be the hypotenuse of the triangle.
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel lines, or other special markings indicated.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a triangle with sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \).
- The lengths of sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are given, but there's no indication of a right angle or parallel lines between them.
- Since no specific geometric relationships are marked, we assume the triangle is not necessarily a right triangle or has any special relationships like parallelism.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \( AB \): \( 4x - 6 \)
- Length of \( BC \): \( 24 \)
- Length of \( AC \): \( 3x - 2 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we need to use the given lengths and any applicable geometric relationships.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the given lengths, and the relationship between the sides to solve for \( x \).
