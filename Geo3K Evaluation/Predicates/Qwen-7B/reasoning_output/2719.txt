STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2719
================================================================================
QUESTION: Refer to the figure at the right. Find the value of m \angle F C E if p \parallel q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two parallel lines \( p \parallel q \).
- There are points labeled \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
- Angles are labeled as \( y^\circ \) at point \( B \), \( (3x - 60)^\circ \) at point \( A \), and \( (2x + 15)^\circ \) at point \( F \).
- There is a right angle symbol at point \( C \).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines \( p \parallel q \) imply corresponding angles are equal and alternate interior angles are equal.
- Since \( p \parallel q \), the angles formed by the transversal through points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) have specific relationships.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle \( y^\circ \) at point \( B \) is part of the transversal formed by lines \( p \) and \( q \).
- Angle \( (3x - 60)^\circ \) at point \( A \) and angle \( (2x + 15)^\circ \) at point \( F \) are related due to the parallel lines.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( m \angle F C E \).
- To find this, we need to use the relationships between the angles formed by the transversal and the parallel lines.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallel lines, the angles formed by the transversal, and the relationships between them.
