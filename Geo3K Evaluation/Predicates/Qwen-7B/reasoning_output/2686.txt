STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2686
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle A B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Points \( A, B, C \) are labeled.
- Lines \( AB, BC, AC \) are drawn connecting these points.
- Angle \( \angle DBC \) is marked as \( 92^\circ \).
- Line \( AD \) is perpendicular to line \( BC \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is formed by points \( A, B, C \).
- Line \( AD \) is perpendicular to line \( BC \), implying \( \angle ADC = 90^\circ \).
- The measure of \( \angle DBC \) is given as \( 92^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific lengths are provided in the diagram except for the angles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( \angle ABC \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, angles, and the relationship between them.
- The goal is to determine the measure of \( \angle ABC \).
