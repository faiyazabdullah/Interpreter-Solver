STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2764
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of the variable y in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with intersecting lines forming several angles.
- Points Y, B, and G are marked.
- Angles at Y are labeled as (3x - 15)° and (y + 25)°.
- Angle at B is marked as 105°.
- Lines DA and BI appear to be parallel as indicated by the arrows pointing in the same direction.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle DBY is formed by the intersection of lines DY and BY.
- Angle GBY is formed by the intersection of lines GB and BY.
- Since lines DA and BI are parallel, angles DBY and GBY are corresponding angles.
- Therefore, angles DBY and GBY are supplementary to the given angles at Y.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle DBY = (3x - 15)°
- Angle GBY = (y + 25)°
- Angle at B = 105°

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of y.
- To find y, we need to use the fact that angles DBY and GBY are supplementary to the given angles at Y and the angle at B.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the angles and their relationships.
- Must ensure all visible geometric constraints and properties are captured.
