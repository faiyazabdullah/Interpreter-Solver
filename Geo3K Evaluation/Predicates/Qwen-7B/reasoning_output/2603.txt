STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2603
================================================================================
QUESTION: If L K = 4, M P = 3, P Q = 6, K J = 2, R S = 6, and L P = 2, find J H.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure contains multiple segments and points connected in a linear fashion.
- Points are labeled as S, R, Q, P, M, H, J, K, L, and M.
- Lines are labeled as segments connecting these points.
- Right angle symbols are indicated at JH and JP.
- Numerical values are provided for lengths: LK = 4, MP = 3, PQ = 6, RJ = 2, RS = 6, and LP = 2.
- No specific shapes like triangles, rectangles, or circles are explicitly marked, but the arrangement suggests a series of right angles and possibly intersecting lines.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines are marked with right angle symbols at JH and JP, implying right angles.
- Points P and Q divide the segment RS into segments RJ = 2 and QS = 4 (since RS = RJ + QS).
- Points L, K, and J form a sequence along a straight line, suggesting collinearity.
- Segment lengths indicate a linear progression with right angles at certain intersections.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - LK = 4
  - MP = 3
  - PQ = 6
  - RJ = 2
  - RS = RJ + QS = 2 + 4 = 6
  - LP = 2

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of JH.
- Given the right angles and linear progression, it's likely that JH is part of a larger configuration involving right triangles or a linear progression involving these right angles.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right angles, lengths, and the relationships between points and lines.
- Must include the lengths provided and the right angle constraints.
