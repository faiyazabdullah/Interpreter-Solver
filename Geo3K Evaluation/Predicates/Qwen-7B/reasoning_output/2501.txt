STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2501
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \triangle P Q R, S T \parallel R Q. If P S = 12.5, S R = 5, and P T = 15, find T Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a triangle \(PQR\) with vertices \(P\), \(Q\), and \(R\).
- The line segment \(ST\) is drawn parallel to \(RQ\).
- Points \(S\) and \(T\) lie on sides \(PR\) and \(PQ\) respectively.
- Given lengths are \(PS = 12.5\), \(SR = 5\), and \(PT = 15\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(ST \parallel RQ\), triangle \(PST\) is similar to triangle \(PQR\) by AA similarity (since \(\angle PST = \angle PQR\) and \(\angle PTS = \angle PRQ\)).
- The ratio of corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We know:
  - \(PS = 12.5\)
  - \(SR = 5\)
  - \(PT = 15\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find \(TQ\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and its similarity.
- Define the lengths of the sides related to the similarity.
