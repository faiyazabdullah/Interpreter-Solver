STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2627
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( O \).
- Points \( R \), \( B \), and \( T \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- \( B \) is the center of the circle.
- Angles \( \angle RBT \) and \( \angle RTB \) are labeled as \( x^\circ \) and \( 2x^\circ \), respectively.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( B \) is the center of the circle, \( BR \) and \( BT \) are radii of the circle, making \( BR = BT \).
- Angles \( \angle RBT \) and \( \angle RTB \) form a triangle \( \triangle RBT \).
- The sum of the angles in triangle \( \triangle RBT \) is \( 180^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The sum of the angles in \( \triangle RBT \) is:
  \[
  x + x + 2x = 180^\circ
  \]
- Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  4x = 180^\circ
  \]

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( x \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, its center, and the angles involved.
