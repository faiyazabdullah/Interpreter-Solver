STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2658
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with points \(E\), \(F\), \(G\), and \(D\) forming a circle with center \(G\).
- There is a line segment \(EF\) passing through point \(F\) and extending to points \(E\) and \(D\).
- Segment \(EF\) appears to be tangent to the circle at point \(F\).
- \(EF = 12\) and \(ED = 16\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Segment \(EF\) is tangent to the circle at point \(F\).
- Since \(EF\) is tangent to the circle, the radius from the center \(G\) to point \(F\) is perpendicular to \(EF\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \(EF = 12\).
- Length of \(ED = 16\).
- We need to find the length of \(GF\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(GF\).
- Given that \(EF\) is tangent to the circle at \(F\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(GF\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the tangency, the lengths of the segments, and the relationship between them.
