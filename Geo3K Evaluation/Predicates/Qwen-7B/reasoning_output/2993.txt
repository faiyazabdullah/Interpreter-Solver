STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2993
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot O, E C and A B are diameters, and \angle B O D \cong \angle D O E \cong \angle E O F \cong \angle F O A. Find m \widehat A C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a circle centered at point \( O \).
- Points \( E, D, B, A, F, \) and \( C \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Lines \( E B, D O, D E, D O, D F, F O,\) and \( F A \) are drawn.
- Angles \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are marked as congruent.
- \( EC \) and \( AB \) are indicated as diameters.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they intersect at the center \( O \).
- Angles \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are congruent.
- Each of these angles subtends half of the circle's circumference.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The circle is divided into four equal parts because the angles \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are congruent.
- Each angle measures \( 90^\circ \) since the total angle around a point is \( 360^\circ \).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of arc \( \widehat{AC} \).
- Since \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they divide the circle into two semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
- Each quarter-circle corresponds to \( 90^\circ \), so the arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is one of these quarters.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, diameters, congruent angles, and the arc.
