STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2945
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle H.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center B.
- There is a point J on the circle.
- Line segments JK and JG are drawn.
- Angle JGB is labeled as 26 degrees.
- Angle JKF is labeled as 88 degrees.
- Line segment HG is drawn from J to G, forming a triangle JHG.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JHG is formed by points J, H, and G.
- Angle JGB is given as 26 degrees.
- Angle JKF is given as 88 degrees.
- These angles are part of the circle and triangle relationships.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle JGB = 26 degrees.
- Angle JKF = 88 degrees.
- The sum of angles in triangle JHG needs to be analyzed.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle H.
- To find angle H, we need to use the properties of the circle and triangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, triangle, and the angles involved.
