STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2866
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 3 = 110 and m \angle 12 = 55. Find the measure of \angle 13.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple triangles and lines.
- Angles are labeled with numbers, such as \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), etc.
- Visible angles include \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \).
- \( m\angle 3 = 110^\circ \) and \( m\angle 12 = 55^\circ \).
- There are no explicit markings indicating right angles or parallel lines.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure consists of several triangles.
- \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are given angles within the figure.
- No direct relationships between specific angles are immediately obvious without further assumptions about triangle types or configurations.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The only numerical values provided are the measures of angles.
- No lengths or other numerical attributes are explicitly given for sides or segments.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of \( \angle 13 \).
- The given angles do not directly provide enough information to determine the measure of \( \angle 13 \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The diagram does not provide enough geometric relationships to solve for \( \angle 13 \) directly using the given information.
- No predicates can be generated from the provided data to answer the question as stated.

Since the question cannot be answered using the given information alone, the following predicates are generated based on the visible data:

```plaintext
Angle(3)
Angle(12)
```

These predicates represent the two given angles, \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \).
