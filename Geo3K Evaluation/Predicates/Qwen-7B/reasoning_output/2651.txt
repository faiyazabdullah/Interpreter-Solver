STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2651
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral A B C D is inscribed in \odot Z such that m \angle B Z A = 104, m \widehat C B = 94, and A B \parallel D C. Find m \angle Z A C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle \(\odot Z\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\) are marked.
- Angles and arcs are labeled with specific measures.
- \(m\angle BZA = 104^\circ\).
- \(m\widehat{CB} = 94^\circ\).
- \(AB \parallel DC\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is cyclic.
- \(AB \parallel DC\).
- \(m\angle BZA\) is an angle subtended by arc \(CB\).
- Arc \(CB\) is given as \(94^\circ\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given: \(m\angle BZA = 104^\circ\).
- Given: \(m\widehat{CB} = 94^\circ\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m\angle ZAC\).
- We need to use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and parallel lines to find \(\angle ZAC\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the cyclic quadrilateral and its properties.
- Represent the given angle and arc measures.
- Capture the relationship between the angles formed by the intersection of lines and the cyclic nature of the quadrilateral.
