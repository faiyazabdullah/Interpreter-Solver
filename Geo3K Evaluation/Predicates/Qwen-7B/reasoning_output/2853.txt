STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2853
================================================================================
QUESTION: a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50, find \cos A.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as \(a = 14\)
- Side BC is marked as \(b = 48\)
- Side AC is marked as \(c = 50\)
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular
- Side AC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(a = 14\)
- \(b = 48\)
- \(c = 50\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(\cos A\)
- This requires knowing the cosine of angle A in the right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
