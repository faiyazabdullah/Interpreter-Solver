STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2409
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 30 degrees
- Side AC is marked as 21 units
- Angle BAC is labeled as 60 degrees
- Angle ABC is labeled as 30 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a triangle with angles 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees).
- Side AB is opposite the 30-degree angle.
- Side AC is opposite the 60-degree angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 30 degrees
- AC = 21 units
- BC is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of BC.
- This requires using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, angles, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
