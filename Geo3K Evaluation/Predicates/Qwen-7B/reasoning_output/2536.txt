STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2536
================================================================================
QUESTION: The diameters of \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C are 10, 30 and 10 units, respectively. Find Z X if A Z \cong C W and C W = 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three circles labeled \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), and \(\odot C\) with diameters \(10\), \(30\), and \(10\) units, respectively.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) lie on the respective circles.
- Points \(E\), \(X\), \(Z\), \(B\), \(Y\), \(W\), and \(C\) are marked on the circles.
- \(A Z \cong C W\) and \(C W = 2\).
- Line segments \(A E\), \(B X\), and \(C Y\) are drawn.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Circle \(\odot A\) has a diameter of \(10\) units.
- Circle \(\odot B\) has a diameter of \(30\) units.
- Circle \(\odot C\) has a diameter of \(10\) units.
- \(A Z \cong C W\) implies \(A Z = C W\).
- Given \(C W = 2\), then \(A Z = 2\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Diameter of \(\odot A\) = \(10\).
- Diameter of \(\odot B\) = \(30\).
- Diameter of \(\odot C\) = \(10\).
- \(A Z = 2\).
- \(C W = 2\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(Z X\) given the relationships and measurements.
- We need to find the length of \(Z X\) based on the given diameters and congruences.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circles and their diameters.
- Represent the congruence between \(A Z\) and \(C W\).
- Calculate the length of \(Z X\).
