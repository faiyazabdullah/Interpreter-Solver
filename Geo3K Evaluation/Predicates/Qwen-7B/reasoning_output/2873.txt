STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2873
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AC is marked as \( y \).
- Side BC is marked as 12 units.
- Side AB is marked as 6 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex A.
- Side AB is perpendicular to side AC.
- Side BC is one of the legs of the right triangle.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 6 units (given)
- BC = 12 units (given)
- AC is the hypotenuse whose length needs to be found.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC (\( y \)).
- This requires applying the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
