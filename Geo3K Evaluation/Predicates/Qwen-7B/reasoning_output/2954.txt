STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2954
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a chord \(AB\) and a point \(C\) on the circumference such that \(C\) lies on the extension of \(AB\).
- Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the circle, making \(AB\) a chord.
- Point \(C\) is positioned on the extension of \(AB\) beyond \(B\), forming a straight line from \(A\) through \(B\) and \(C\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(AB\) is a chord of the circle.
- \(AC\) forms a straight line extending through the circle.
- Since \(AB\) is a chord and \(C\) lies on the extension of \(AB\), the angle \(\angle BAC\) is formed where \(BC\) is part of the circle's circumference.
- The angle \(\angle BAC\) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \(BC\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific lengths or angles are given in the diagram, so we cannot extract numerical values directly from the image.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 2\).
- Given the context, it appears that \(\angle 2\) might be an inscribed angle related to the circle, but without specific values or additional information, we cannot determine its measure directly.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the chord, and the straight line extending through the circle.
- Since no specific measures are provided, we focus on the geometric relationships and constraints.
