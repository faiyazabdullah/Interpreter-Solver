STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2761
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles labeled ABC and DEF.
- Triangle ABC has vertices A, B, and C.
- Triangle DEF has vertices D, E, and F.
- Side BC is marked as \(3x\).
- Side EF is marked as \(6\).
- Side AB is marked as \(8\).
- Side DF is marked as \(x\).

- Triangle ABC has a right angle at point B.
- Triangle DEF appears to have a right angle at point D.

- There are no right angle symbols explicitly shown on the diagram for triangle DEF, but it appears to have a right angle due to the labeling convention suggesting that the sides form a right triangle configuration similar to ABC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both triangles appear to be right triangles.
- In triangle ABC, the right angle is at vertex B.
- In triangle DEF, the right angle is at vertex D.
- Sides BC and EF are corresponding sides of the triangles and appear to be proportional.
- Sides AB and DF are also corresponding sides and appear to be proportional.
- The triangles are similar because they share a common right angle and their sides are proportional.

- Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.
- Therefore, we can write the proportionality equation: \(\frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AB}{DF}\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = \(3x\)
- EF = \(6\)
- AB = \(8\)
- DF = \(x\)

- From the proportionality equation, we have: \(\frac{3x}{6} = \frac{8}{x}\).

- Simplifying the left side of the proportion: \(\frac{3x}{6} = \frac{x}{2}\).

- So, the equation becomes: \(\frac{x}{2} = \frac{8}{x}\).

- Cross-multiplying gives: \(x^2 = 16\).

- Solving for \(x\): \(x = \sqrt{16} = 4\).

- Thus, \(x = 4\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\).
- We need to use the geometric relationship derived from the similarity of the triangles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, right angles, proportional sides, and the equality derived from the proportionality equation.
