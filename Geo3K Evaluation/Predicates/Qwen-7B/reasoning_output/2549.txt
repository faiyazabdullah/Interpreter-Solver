STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2549
================================================================================
QUESTION: If A E = m - 2, E C = m + 4, A D = 4, and A B = 20, find m.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A, B, C \).
- Points \( D \) and \( E \) are marked within the triangle.
- Lines \( AD \) and \( BE \) intersect at point \( E \).
- Segment \( AE = m - 2 \).
- Segment \( EC = m + 4 \).
- Segment \( AD = 4 \).
- Segment \( AB = 20 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- No specific geometric relationships are marked between the segments or angles in the diagram.
- The lengths of the segments are given but do not indicate any specific geometric relationships like parallelism, perpendicularity, or congruence.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - \( AE = m - 2 \)
  - \( EC = m + 4 \)
  - \( AD = 4 \)
  - \( AB = 20 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( m \).
- We need to use the given segment lengths to determine \( m \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the segments and their relationships.
- The lengths given imply a linear relationship between the segments.
