STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2433
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( x \).
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 17 units.
- Angle \( \angle B \) is marked as \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has an angle \( \angle B = 60^\circ \).
- Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \), the remaining angles in the triangle can be calculated if needed.
- No direct relationship between \( x \) and 17 is provided except through trigonometric functions or cosine rule.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side \( BC = 17 \) units.
- Side \( AB = x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AB \), which is \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we need to use the cosine rule in \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and its sides.
- Use the cosine rule formula to find \( x \).
