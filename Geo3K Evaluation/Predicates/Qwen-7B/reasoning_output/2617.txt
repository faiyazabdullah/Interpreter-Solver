STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2617
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \triangle D E F, m \angle E = 108, m \angle F = 26, and f = 20. Find d to the nearest whole number.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle DEF with vertices labeled D, E, F
- Angle E is marked as 108 degrees
- Angle F is marked as 26 degrees
- Side EF is marked as 20 units
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks visible

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle DEF has angles E, F, and D summing up to 180 degrees.
- The sum of angles in triangle DEF is calculated as follows: 
  Angle D = 180 - Angle E - Angle F = 180 - 108 - 26 = 46 degrees.

- No specific relationships such as parallelism or congruence are indicated.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle E = 108 degrees
- Angle F = 26 degrees
- Side EF = 20 units

- No other lengths or angles are marked.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of side DF to the nearest whole number.

- This requires using trigonometric relationships involving the known angle and side in triangle DEF.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, angles, and side lengths.
