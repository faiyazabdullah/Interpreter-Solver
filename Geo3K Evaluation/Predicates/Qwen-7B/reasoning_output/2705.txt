STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2705
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Angles at vertices B and D are labeled with expressions involving \(y\) and \(x\).
- Angles at vertices A and C are also labeled with expressions involving \(x\) and \(y\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD appears to have opposite angles that sum to \(180^\circ\), indicating it could be a parallelogram.
- The angles at vertices B and D are given as \((6y - 57)^\circ\) and \((3x + 9)^\circ\).
- The angles at vertices A and C are given as \((5x - 19)^\circ\) and \((3y + 36)^\circ\).
- Since opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, we can set up equations based on these relationships.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The expressions for the angles are:
  - \((6y - 57)^\circ\) at vertex B.
  - \((5x - 19)^\circ\) at vertex A.
  - \((3x + 9)^\circ\) at vertex D.
  - \((3y + 36)^\circ\) at vertex C.
- We need to find \(y\) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \(y\) so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- This requires setting the opposite angles equal to each other.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and the relationships between them.
- We will use the fact that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal to form the necessary equations.
