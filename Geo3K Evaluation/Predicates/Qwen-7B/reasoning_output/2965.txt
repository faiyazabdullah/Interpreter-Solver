STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2965
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle WXY with vertices labeled W, X, Y
- Side WX is marked as \(9x\)
- Side XY is marked as \(4x + 5\)
- Side WY is marked as \(6x + 3\)
- The triangle appears to be a scalene triangle as no specific markings indicate congruence or similarity.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle WXY does not appear to have any special markings indicating congruence or similarity.
- No parallel or perpendicular relationships are indicated between sides.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = \(9x\)
- XY = \(4x + 5\)
- WY = \(6x + 3\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\).
- We need to use the fact that the sum of the lengths of two sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, side lengths, and the relationship that the sum of two sides must be greater than the third side.
