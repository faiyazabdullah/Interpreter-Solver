STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2799
================================================================================
QUESTION: Chords A C and D F are equidistant from the center. If the radius of \odot G is 26, find A C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a circle with center \( G \).
- Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \).
- The radius of the circle \( G \) is given as 26.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are radii of the circle.
- Since \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \), they are equal in length.
- Both chords subtend equal arcs because they are equidistant from the center.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle \( G \) is given as 26.
- Since both chords are radii of the circle, \( AC = DF = 26 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( AC \).
- Since \( AC \) is a radius of the circle, its length is the same as the given radius.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its radius.
- Represent the equal length of the chords \( AC \) and \( DF \).
