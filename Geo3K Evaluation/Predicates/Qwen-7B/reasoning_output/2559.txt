STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2559
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as \( y \).
- Side BC is marked as \( 8\sqrt{3} \).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex B.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- Side BC is one of the legs of the right triangle.
- The angle at vertex A is 60 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( BC = 8\sqrt{3} \).
- The angle at vertex A is 60 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AB, which is the hypotenuse.
- We need to use the properties of the right triangle and the given angle to find AB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include the hypotenuse calculation using trigonometric functions.
