STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2949
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 8 km.
- Side CD is marked as 11 km.
- Side AD is marked as 10 km.
- There is a dashed line segment from point H on AD to point B on AB, which is perpendicular to AB and AD.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid ABCD has one pair of parallel sides (AB and CD).
- AB || CD.
- The perpendicular segment BH is drawn from point B to line AD.
- BH = 10 km.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 8 km.
- CD = 11 km.
- AD = 10 km.
- BH = 10 km.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the trapezoid ABCD.
- To find the area of a trapezoid, we use the formula: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{base}_1 + \text{base}_2) \times \text{height}
  \]
  where base_1 and base_2 are the lengths of the parallel sides, and the height is the perpendicular distance between them.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, parallel sides, height, and the area calculation.
- Must include the given measurements and the relationship between the sides and the height.
