STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2508
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle labeled \( \triangle ABC \).
- Vertex \( A \) is connected to vertices \( B \) and \( C \).
- Angle \( B \) appears to be a right angle.
- Side \( AB \) is labeled as \( 2x + 11 \).
- Side \( AC \) is labeled as \( 6x - 9 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( ABC \) has a right angle at vertex \( B \), making it a right triangle.
- Side \( AB \) and side \( AC \) form the legs of the right triangle.
- Side \( BC \) would be the hypotenuse if we were to find its length.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side \( AB = 2x + 11 \).
- Side \( AC = 6x - 9 \).
- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, the lengths \( AB \) and \( AC \) should satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: \( AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( x \).
- We need to use the Pythagorean theorem to establish the relationship between the sides.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and the right angle.
- Define the lengths of sides \( AB \) and \( AC \).
- Apply the Pythagorean theorem.
