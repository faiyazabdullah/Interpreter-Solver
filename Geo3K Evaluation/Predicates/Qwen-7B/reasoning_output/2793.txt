STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2793
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Angles at vertices are labeled as (8x - 8)°, (7y + 2)°, (6y + 16)°, and (6x + 14)°
- No special markings like parallel lines, right angles, or congruences are visible

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since no specific geometric properties are marked, we assume it's a general quadrilateral
- We need to determine if the quadrilateral can be a parallelogram
- For a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, opposite angles must be equal
- Therefore, we need to set up equations to check for equality of opposite angles

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angles are expressed in terms of x and y
- We have four angles: (8x - 8)°, (7y + 2)°, (6y + 16)°, and (6x + 14)°
- We need to find y such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram
- This implies opposite angles must be equal

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, angles, and the condition for being a parallelogram
- Must ensure opposite angles are equal
