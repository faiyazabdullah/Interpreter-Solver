STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2877
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the regular polygon figure. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a regular hexagon labeled with points A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- The center of the hexagon is labeled as H.
- A line segment HE is marked as 5 meters.
- All sides of the hexagon are equal in length.
- All internal angles of the hexagon are equal.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The hexagon is a regular polygon.
- All sides (AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GA) are congruent.
- All internal angles (∠A, ∠B, ∠C, ∠D, ∠E, ∠F, ∠G) are congruent.
- The distance from the center H to any vertex (HE, HF, HG, HA, HB, HC) is the same (5 meters).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The distance HE = 5 meters.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the regular hexagon.
- To find the area, we need to know the side length of the hexagon.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the hexagon, the center point, the radii, and the relationship between the side length and the given radius.
