================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a central angle marked as \(110^\circ\) and two arcs, \(97^\circ\) and \(x^\circ\).
- There is a point \(A\) inside the circle, connected to several points on the circumference (\(G, K, L, J, H\)).
- The arc \(GH\) subtends an angle of \(110^\circ\) at the center of the circle.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The circle has a central angle of \(110^\circ\).
- The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\).
- The arcs \(KG\), \(GL\), \(LK\), and \(JH\) form a complete circle around point \(A\).
- The sum of the arc measures \(97^\circ + x^\circ\) must equal \(360^\circ - 110^\circ = 250^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The arc \(KG\) measures \(97^\circ\).
- The central angle \(110^\circ\) is given.
- We need to find the measure of the arc \(x^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of the arc \(x^\circ\).
- This involves using the relationship between the central angle and the arc measures.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, its central angle, arcs, and the relationship between them.
