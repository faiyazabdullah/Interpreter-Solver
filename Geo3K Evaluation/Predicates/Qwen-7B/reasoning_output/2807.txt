STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2807
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Lines \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).
- The lengths of segments \(AE\) and \(EC\) are labeled as 3 and 4 respectively.
- The lengths of segments \(BE\) and \(ED\) are labeled as 4 and 6 respectively.
- There are no right angles or perpendicular lines indicated.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is cyclic.
- Angles \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) subtend the same arc \(BC\).
- Angles \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) subtend the same arc \(AD\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AE = 3\)
- \(EC = 4\)
- \(BE = 4\)
- \(ED = 6\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of \(\angle A\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral, lengths of segments, and the relationship between angles subtended by arcs.
