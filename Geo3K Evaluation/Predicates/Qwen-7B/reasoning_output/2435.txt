STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2435
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle labeled with vertices A, B, and C.
- Angles at vertices A and B are given as 40° and 25°, respectively.
- There is no right angle symbol, so triangle ABC is not a right triangle.
- The lengths of sides AB and BC are not explicitly given, but they are represented by the red segments.
- Side AC is marked with a blue segment and has a length of 25 units.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a general triangle, not a right triangle.
- The sum of angles in a triangle is always 180°.
- Therefore, the measure of angle C can be found by subtracting the measures of angles A and B from 180°.
- The relationship between the angles and sides of the triangle can be analyzed using the Law of Sines.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle A = 40°
- Angle B = 25°
- Angle C = 180° - 40° - 25° = 115°
- Length of side AC = 25 units

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of angle x, which is angle C.
- We have already calculated angle C to be 115°.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, angles, and the given length of side AC.
