STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2599
================================================================================
QUESTION: If S T = 8, T R = 4, and P T = 6, find Q R.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral PQSR with vertices labeled P, Q, R, S
- Points T lies on line PT and TR
- Lines PQ, PS, QR, and RT form the sides of the quadrilateral
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks visible
- Line PT is marked as 6 units long
- Line ST is marked as 8 units long
- Line TR is marked as 4 units long
- Line QT is marked as 10 units long
- Line PR is marked as 12 units long

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- No specific geometric relationships are explicitly marked (parallel, perpendicular, congruent, etc.)
- The quadrilateral PQSR does not appear to have any special properties like being a rectangle, parallelogram, etc.
- The lengths of segments PT, TR, ST, QT, PR, and QR are given.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- PT = 6
- ST = 8
- TR = 4
- QT = 10
- PR = 12
- QR is the unknown length we need to find

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of QR.
- We need to use the given segment lengths to determine QR.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral and its sides' lengths.
- We will not derive any relationships or solve for QR yet, just list the given lengths.
