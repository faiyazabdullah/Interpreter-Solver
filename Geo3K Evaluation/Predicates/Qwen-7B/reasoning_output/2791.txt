STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2791
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find a, if F G = 18, G H = 42, and F K = 15.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( O \).
- Points \( G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z \) lie on the circle.
- Segments \( FG, GH, KH, JK, KL, LJ, MJ, NJ, PJ, QJ, RJ, SJ, TJ, UJ, VJ, WJ, XJ, YJ, ZJ \) are drawn.
- \( FG = 18 \)
- \( GH = 42 \)
- \( FK = 15 \)

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The segments are chords of the circle.
- Chords \( FG \) and \( GH \) are connected at point \( G \).
- Chord \( FK \) is a segment from the center \( O \) to a point on the circle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( FG = 18 \)
- \( GH = 42 \)
- \( FK = 15 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of chord \( FG \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle and its chords.
- Represent the given lengths and the relationship between the chords and the circle.
