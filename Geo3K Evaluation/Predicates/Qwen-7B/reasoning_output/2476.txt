REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(MNPQ\) with vertices labeled \(M\), \(N\), \(P\), and \(Q\).
- Angles \( \angle PMN \) and \( \angle QPN \) are marked.
- The quadrilateral appears to have some specific properties, as indicated by the angles and side lengths provided.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral is a parallelogram (\(MNPQ\)) because opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- The angles \( \angle PMN = 33^\circ \) and \( \angle QPN = 83^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given side lengths:
  - \( MN = 3x - 4 \)
  - \( PQ = 11.1 \)
  - \( MP = 4w - 3 \)
  - \( NP = 2y + 5 \)
  - \( MR = 20 \)
  - \( PR = 17.9 \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \angle RMN \).
- Since \( \angle PMN = 33^\circ \) and \( MNPQ \) is a parallelogram, \( \angle RMN \) is supplementary to \( \angle PMN \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, angles, and side lengths.
- Must include the supplementary relationship between \( \angle PMN \) and \( \angle RMN \).
