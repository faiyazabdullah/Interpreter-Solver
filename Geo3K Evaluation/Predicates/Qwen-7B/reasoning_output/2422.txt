STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2422
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the length of \widehat A B. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center \(O\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- The radius of the circle is \(14\) meters.
- An angle \(\angle AOB\) is marked as \(80^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points \(A\) and \(B\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- \(O\) is the center of the circle.
- \(\angle AOB = 80^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of the circle = \(14\) meters.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of arc \(AB\).
- The length of arc \(AB\) can be calculated using the formula for the arc length of a circle, which is given by:
  \[
  \text{Arc Length} = 2 \pi r \left( \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \right)
  \]
  where \(r\) is the radius and \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle with its center and radius.
- Represent the points \(A\) and \(B\) on the circumference.
- Represent the angle \(\angle AOB\) and its measurement.
- Calculate the arc length using the formula.
