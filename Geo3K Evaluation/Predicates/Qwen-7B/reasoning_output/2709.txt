STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2709
================================================================================
QUESTION: Circle J has a radius of 10 units, \odot K has a radius of 8 units, and B C = 5.4 units. Find C K.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows two circles intersecting at point B.
- Circle J has a radius of 10 units.
- Circle K has a radius of 8 units.
- Line segment BC is given as 5.4 units.
- Points A, B, C, D, J, and K are marked.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The circles intersect at point B.
- BC is a common chord of both circles.
- AB is a tangent to circle K at point B.
- The distance between the centers of the circles (J and K) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem involving the radii and the given length BC.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of Circle J = 10 units.
- Radius of Circle K = 8 units.
- Length BC = 5.4 units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of CK.
- We need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between the centers of the circles and then use it to determine the length of CK.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circles, their radii, the intersecting point B, the common chord BC, and the distance CK.
- The length BC is given as 5.4 units.
- We will calculate the distance CK using the Pythagorean theorem.
