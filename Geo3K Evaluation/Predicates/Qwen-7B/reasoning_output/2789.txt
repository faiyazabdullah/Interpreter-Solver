STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2789
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot T, Z V = 1, and T W = 13. Find X Y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at point \( T \).
- Points \( X, Y, Z, \) and \( W \) lie on the circle.
- A right angle is marked between lines \( XV \) and \( TW \).
- The lengths \( ZV = 1 \) and \( TW = 13 \) are given.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( ZV \) is a vertical line segment from \( Z \) to \( V \).
- \( TW \) is a horizontal line segment from \( T \) to \( W \).
- \( XV \) connects \( X \) to \( V \).
- \( TW \perp XV \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( ZV = 1 \).
- \( TW = 13 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( XY \).
- Since \( XY \) is a chord of the circle passing through points \( X \) and \( Y \), we need to determine its length given the perpendicular distance \( ZV \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the chords, the right angle, and the given lengths.
- The key relationship here is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord.
