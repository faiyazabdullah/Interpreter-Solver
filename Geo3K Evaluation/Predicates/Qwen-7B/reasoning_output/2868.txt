STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2868
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 5 units long.
- Side BC is marked as 12 units long.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B, indicating that angle ABC is a right angle.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex B.
- Side AB is perpendicular to side BC.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 5 units (given).
- BC = 12 units (given).
- AC needs to be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC.
- To find AC, we use the Pythagorean theorem: \( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths of sides, and the relationship between them.
- We will not include the calculation of AC here as it is derived from the given lengths and the Pythagorean theorem.
