STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2408
================================================================================
QUESTION: If X N = 6, X M = 2, and X Y = 10, find N Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, Z.
- Side XY is marked as 10 units.
- Side XZ is marked as 6 units.
- Side YZ is marked as 8 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex X.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex X.
- Sides XY and XZ are perpendicular.
- Side YZ is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XY = 10 units (given)
- XZ = 6 units (given)
- YZ = 8 units (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of NZ.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
