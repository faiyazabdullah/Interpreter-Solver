STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2486
================================================================================
QUESTION: Circle O has a radius of 13 inches. Radius O B is perpendicular to chord C D which is 24 inches long. If m \widehat C D = 134, find m \widehat C B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at point \( O \).
- Radius \( OB \) is perpendicular to chord \( CD \).
- Chord \( CD \) is 24 inches long.
- The measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is 134 degrees.
- Point \( X \) is the midpoint of chord \( CD \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Radius \( OB \) is perpendicular to chord \( CD \).
- Chord \( CD \) is bisected at point \( X \).
- Since \( OB \perp CD \), triangles \( OXC \) and \( OXD \) are right triangles.
- Arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is given as 134 degrees, which implies the central angle \( \angle COB = 134^\circ \).
- Since \( OB \perp CD \), the angles \( \angle OXB \) and \( \angle OXD \) are both 90 degrees.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius \( OB = OC = OD = 13 \) inches.
- Length of chord \( CD = 24 \) inches.
- The measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} = 134^\circ \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc \( \widehat{CB} \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, radii, chords, arcs, and relationships.
- Ensure all visible information is captured without directly stating the solution.
