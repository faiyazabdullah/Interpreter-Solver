STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2831
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) inscribed in a circle.
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) are chords of the circle.
- Segments \(BC\) and \(AD\) are diagonals of the quadrilateral.
- Angles \(\angle BAC\) and \(\angle BDC\) are formed at point \(B\).
- Angles \(\angle ADB\) and \(\angle ABC\) are formed at point \(D\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is cyclic because its vertices lie on a circle.
- Chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect at point \(E\).
- Diagonals \(BC\) and \(AD\) intersect at point \(F\).
- Segments \(BE\) and \(EC\) form part of the chord \(BC\).
- Segments \(AF\) and \(FD\) form part of the chord \(AD\).
- Segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) are tangents at points \(E\) and \(F\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - \(AB = 15\)
  - \(CD = 8\)
  - \(BC = 12\)
  - \(AD = x\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \(AD\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral, tangents, chords, and lengths given.
- Must include the length of \(AD\) as the unknown to be found.
