STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2401
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see an isosceles triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 13 units.
- Side AC is marked as 13 units.
- Side BC is marked as 10 units.
- There is a perpendicular line segment from B to AC, indicating a right angle at vertex B.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC = 13 units.
- Side BC is 10 units long.
- The perpendicular line from B to AC creates two right triangles, ABP and CBP, where P is the foot of the perpendicular from B to AC.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 13 units.
- AC = 13 units.
- BC = 10 units.
- The perpendicular distance from B to AC splits AC into two equal parts if ABP and CBP are right triangles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the figure.
- To find the area, we need to determine the height BP and the base AC.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
