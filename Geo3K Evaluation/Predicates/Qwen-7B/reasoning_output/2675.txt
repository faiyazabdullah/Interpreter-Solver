STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2675
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of m \angle 1. Assume that segments that appear tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center E.
- Points B, D, and C lie on the circle.
- Angle BED is given as 102°.
- Segment BC is tangent to the circle at point C.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Segment BC is tangent to the circle at point C.
- Therefore, angle BDC is a right angle (90°).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle BED = 102°.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1, which appears to be angle BDC.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, tangency, and the given angle.
- Angle BDC is a right angle due to the tangent property.
