STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2917
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find T Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle RST \) with vertices \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).
- Side \( RS \) is marked as 7 units.
- Side \( ST \) is marked as 7 units.
- Side \( RT \) is marked as \( x + 3 \).
- Side \( QT \) is marked as \( 2x - 6 \).
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( S \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle RST \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( S \).
- \( RS \perp ST \).
- \( RS \) and \( ST \) are perpendicular sides forming the legs of the right triangle.
- \( RT \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle RST \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( RS = 7 \) units.
- \( ST = 7 \) units.
- \( RT = x + 3 \) units.
- \( QT = 2x - 6 \) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( QT \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, right angle, lengths, and relationships involving the right triangle.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties related to the right triangle.
