STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2845
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 58, m \angle 2 = 47, and m \angle 3 = 26. Find the measure of \angle 9.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple triangles and lines.
- Points are labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\).
- Lines are connecting these points forming several triangles.
- Angles are marked with numbers: \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 2\), \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 4\), \(\angle 5\), \(\angle 6\), \(\angle 7\), \(\angle 8\), \(\angle 9\).

#### Step 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles \( \triangle AEC \), \( \triangle BCE \), and \( \triangle BCD \) are visible.
- Angles \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), and \( \angle 3 \) are part of the larger geometric structure.
- Angles \( \angle 4 \), \( \angle 5 \), \( \angle 6 \), \( \angle 7 \), \( \angle 8 \), and \( \angle 9 \) are formed within these triangles.

#### Step 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given measurements: \( m \angle 1 = 58^\circ \), \( m \angle 2 = 47^\circ \), \( m \angle 3 = 26^\circ \).
- These angles are part of the geometric structure and are used to find the measure of \( \angle 9 \).

#### Step 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of \( \angle 9 \).
- We need to use the given angles and geometric relationships to find \( \angle 9 \).

#### Step 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all triangles, angles, and given measurements.
- Ensure all relationships and properties are captured.
