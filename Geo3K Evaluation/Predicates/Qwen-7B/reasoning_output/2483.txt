STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2483
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find Q P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle \( \triangle MNO \) with vertices labeled \( M, N, O \).
- Side \( MN \) is marked as 5 units.
- Side \( NO \) is marked as \( 3\frac{3}{5} \) units, which is equivalent to \( 3.6 \) units.
- Side \( MO \) is marked as 6 units.
- There is no indication of any special markings like right angles or parallel lines.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle MNO \) appears to be a general triangle with no specific properties mentioned.
- The sides \( MN, NO, \) and \( MO \) are labeled with lengths.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( MN = 5 \) units.
- \( NO = 3.6 \) units.
- \( MO = 6 \) units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( PQ \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle and its sides with given lengths.
