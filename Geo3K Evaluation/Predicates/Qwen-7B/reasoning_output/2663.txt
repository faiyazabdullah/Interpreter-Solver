STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2663
================================================================================
QUESTION: Trapezoid G H J K has an area of 188.35 square feet. If H J is 16.5 feet, find G K.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a trapezoid \( GHJK \).
- Points \( G, H, J, K \) are labeled.
- Line segments \( GJ \) and \( HK \) are parallel, indicating a trapezoid.
- \( GJ \) is the longer base.
- \( HK \) is the shorter base.
- \( HJ \) is a lateral side.
- The height from \( H \) to \( GJ \) is labeled as 8.7 ft.
- The length of \( GJ \) is 16.5 ft.
- The area of the trapezoid is given as 188.35 square feet.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid \( GHJK \) has parallel sides \( GJ \) and \( HK \).
- \( HJ \) is a non-parallel side.
- \( GJ \) is the longer base.
- \( HK \) is the shorter base.
- The height is perpendicular to both bases.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( GJ = 16.5 \) ft.
- \( HK = G \).
- \( HJ = 16.5 \) ft.
- The height \( h = 8.7 \) ft.
- The area \( A = 188.35 \) square feet.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( GJ \).
- Since the length of \( GJ \) is already given as 16.5 ft, the question seems to be redundant or there might be an error in the problem statement.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the trapezoid shape.
- Capture the parallel relationship.
- Capture the height and lengths involved.
