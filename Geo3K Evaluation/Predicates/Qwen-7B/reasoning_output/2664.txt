STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2664
================================================================================
QUESTION: What is the measure of \angle B if m \angle A = 10?

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - A circle is centered at point I.
  - A triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle, with vertices A, B, and C.
  - Points E, F, G, H, and D lie on the circle.
  
- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - ∠AIE is labeled as 15°.
  - ∠CIF is labeled as 95°.
  
- **Special Markings**:
  - No specific markings like right angles or parallel lines are indicated in the diagram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - ∠AIE and ∠CIF are given as 15° and 95° respectively.
  - These angles are inscribed angles subtending arcs EF and CFG respectively.
  - Since the sum of the angles around point I is 360°, the remaining angles can be deduced.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Visible Measurements**:
  - ∠AIE = 15°
  - ∠CIF = 95°
  - No lengths of sides or other specific measurements are provided.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Question**: What is the measure of ∠B if m∠A = 10?
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The measure of ∠B would depend on the properties of the inscribed triangle and the circle.
  - However, the question specifically asks for the measure of ∠B, which is not directly calculable from the given information without additional geometric properties or relationships within the circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates**:
  - Represent the circle and the inscribed triangle.
  - Represent the given angles.
  - Ensure all relationships are captured.
