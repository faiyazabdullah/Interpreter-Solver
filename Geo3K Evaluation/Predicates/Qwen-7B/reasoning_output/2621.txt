STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2621
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find S T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle STU with vertices labeled S, T, U
- Side ST is marked as \(12 + x\)
- Side TU is marked as \(3x + 3\)
- Side SU is marked as \(4x - 4\)
- No right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks are visible.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle STU is a general triangle with no specific geometric relationships (like right angle, parallel sides, etc.) indicated.
- The lengths of the sides are expressed as algebraic expressions.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ST = \(12 + x\)
- TU = \(3x + 3\)
- SU = \(4x - 4\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of ST.
- We need to express ST in terms of \(x\) or find its numerical value if possible.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle and its sides with their given expressions.
- Must include the algebraic expressions for the sides.
