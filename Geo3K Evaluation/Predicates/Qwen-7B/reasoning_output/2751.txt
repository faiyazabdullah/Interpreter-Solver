STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2751
================================================================================
QUESTION: If \frac { I J } { X J } = \frac { H J } { Y J }, m \angle W X J = 130 and m \angle W Z G = 20, find m \angle Y I Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a complex geometric figure involving several triangles and a line segment.
- Points labeled are W, X, Y, Z, I, J, G, H, L, C, D.
- Angles and segments are marked with specific measurements:
  - Angle WXJ is 130째.
  - Angle WZG is 20째.
  - The ratio of lengths IJ/XJ equals HJ/YJ.
- The figure includes triangles and a line segment connecting various points.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles WXYZ, WJI, and WGH are identified.
- Triangles WXYZ and WJI appear to have some proportional relationship due to the given ratios.
- Line segment WX is common to triangles WXYZ and WJI.
- Angles WXJ and WZG are given specific measures.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle WXJ = 130째.
- Angle WZG = 20째.
- The ratio \(\frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ}\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of angle YIZ.
- The given angles and ratios imply a specific geometric configuration where triangles WXYZ and WJI might be similar or have certain proportional relationships.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles WXYZ, WJI, and WGH.
- Capture the angles and their measures.
- Encode the proportional relationship between the segments.
