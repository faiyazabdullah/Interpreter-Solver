STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2718
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 1.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle EGF with vertices labeled E, G, F
- Side EG is marked as 25 degrees
- Side GF is marked as 65 degrees
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex G

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle EGF is a right triangle with right angle at G
- Sides EG and GF are perpendicular
- Side EF is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- EG = 25 degrees (given)
- GF = 65 degrees (given)
- EF length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1
- This requires using the geometric relationships visible in the triangle
- The problem involves finding the measure of an angle in a right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
