STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2875
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find P S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \(PQR\) with a point \(R\) where the right angle is marked.
- The vertices are labeled \(P\), \(Q\), and \(R\).
- The sides are labeled as follows:
  - \(PR = 9\)
  - \(QR = 7\)
  - \(PQ = 7\)
- \(P\) is directly above \(Q\) forming a vertical line segment.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(PQR\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(R\).
- \(PQ\) and \(QR\) form the legs of the right triangle.
- \(PR\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(PQR\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(PR = 9\)
- \(QR = 7\)
- \(PQ = 7\)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(PS\).
- Since there is no direct measurement or relationship involving \(PS\) in the diagram, we need to infer that \(S\) is the same as \(P\) because the diagram does not show any distinct point \(S\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the right triangle, the right angle, and the given measurements.
- Since the question asks for \(PS\), and \(P\) and \(S\) are assumed to be the same point due to lack of additional information, we will use the given length of \(PR\) which is 9.
