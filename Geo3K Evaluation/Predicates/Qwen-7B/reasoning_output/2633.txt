STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2633
================================================================================
QUESTION: m \angle 2 = 2 x, m \angle 3 = x. Find m \angle 3.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H are marked on the circle.
- Angles ∠2 and ∠3 are marked within the circle.
- Angle ∠2 is labeled as 2x.
- Angle ∠3 is labeled as x.
- Line segments are drawn connecting various points, forming triangles and quadrilaterals.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Angles ∠2 and ∠3 are part of the circle and its inscribed figures.
- The relationship between ∠2 and ∠3 is given as ∠2 = 2∠3.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The given measurement is ∠2 = 2x.
- The given measurement is ∠3 = x.
- ∠2 is twice ∠3.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠3.
- The relationship ∠2 = 2∠3 needs to be solved for ∠3.
- We need to find the value of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The predicates will represent the circle, the angles ∠2 and ∠3, and their relationship.
- The predicates will not involve the final solution but the given information and constraints.
