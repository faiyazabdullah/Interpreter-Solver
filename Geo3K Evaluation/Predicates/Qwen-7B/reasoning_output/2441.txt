STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2441
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 3 = 110 and m \angle 12 = 55. Find the measure of \angle 1.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with multiple triangles, lines, and angles.
- There are labeled angles like $\angle 1$, $\angle 2$, $\angle 3$, $\angle 4$, $\angle 12$, $\angle 13$, $\angle 14$, etc.
- Points and lines are marked with numbers indicating angles or lengths.
- Specifically, $\angle 3$ is marked as 110 degrees, and $\angle 12$ is marked as 55 degrees.
- There are no right angles, perpendicular lines, or other specific markings that imply special relationships between the lines.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure contains multiple triangles and lines intersecting at various angles.
- No specific relationships such as parallelism or perpendicularity are explicitly marked.
- Angles $\angle 3$ and $\angle 12$ are given, but there is no direct relationship between them provided in the image.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Numerical values provided are $\angle 3 = 110^\circ$ and $\angle 12 = 55^\circ$.
- No other lengths or angles are explicitly marked, so we cannot infer any additional measurements from the diagram alone.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of $\angle 1$.
- Since there are no direct relationships or additional angles connecting $\angle 1$ to $\angle 3$ or $\angle 12$, the question seems to be asking about an indirect relationship involving these angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the given angles and their measures.
- No other relationships or constraints are provided in the diagram.
