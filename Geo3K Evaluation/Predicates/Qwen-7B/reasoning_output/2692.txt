STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2692
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains two triangles labeled \( \triangle WEF \) and \( \triangle W'EF \).
- Points \( W, W', E, F \) are marked.
- Line segment \( EF \) is marked with a length of 10.5.
- Line segment \( WF \) is marked with a length of 14.
- Line segments \( WE \) and \( W'E \) are marked but not explicitly labeled for lengths.
- The triangles share side \( EF \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle WEF \) and \( \triangle W'EF \) are congruent triangles because they share side \( EF \) and have the same orientation.
- \( \angle WEF = \angle W'EF \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \( EF = 10.5 \).
- Length of \( WF = 14 \).
- \( WE \) and \( W'E \) are congruent sides in the respective triangles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( x \), which seems to refer to the length of \( WE \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the congruence of triangles.
- Represent the lengths of the sides involved.
