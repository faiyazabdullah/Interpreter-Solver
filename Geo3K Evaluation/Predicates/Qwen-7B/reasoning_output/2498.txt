STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2498
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 1.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Angle A measures 52 degrees.
- Angle B measures 27 degrees.
- Angle C is formed by extending line BC to point D, making it a straight line.
- Points A, B, and C lie on a straight line when extended through point D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a triangle with angles summing up to 180 degrees.
- Angles A, B, and C form a linear pair with angle DBC forming a straight line.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle A = 52 degrees.
- Angle B = 27 degrees.
- Angle C + Angle DBC = 180 degrees because they form a straight line.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1, which is angle C.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, angles, and relationships involving angle C.
