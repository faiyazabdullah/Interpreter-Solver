================================================================================
QUESTION: Find W R.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram \(WRSV\).
- Points \(W\), \(R\), \(S\), and \(V\) are labeled.
- Lines \(WR\), \(RS\), \(SV\), and \(VT\) form the sides of the parallelogram.
- Angles \(\angle WRS\) and \(\angle SRT\) are marked as right angles.
- Lengths \(WR = x + 6\), \(RS = 8\), \(SV = 10\), and \(VT = 2x + 6\) are given.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure shows a parallelogram \(WRSV\) with right angles at \(W\) and \(S\).
- \(WR\) and \(SV\) are opposite sides of the parallelogram.
- \(RS\) and \(VT\) are opposite sides of the parallelogram.
- Right angles imply perpendicularity between certain segments.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(WR = x + 6\)
- \(RS = 8\)
- \(SV = 10\)
- \(VT = 2x + 6\)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(WR\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, right angles, lengths, and relationships between sides.
