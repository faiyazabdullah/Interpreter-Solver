STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2631
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that a \parallel b.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines labeled as \(a\) and \(b\).
- Points \(A\) and \(B\) are on line \(a\).
- Points \(E\) and \(F\) are on line \(b\).
- Angles \((4x + 11)^\circ\) and \((8x + 1)^\circ\) are formed between the lines.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel.
- Angles \((4x + 11)^\circ\) and \((8x + 1)^\circ\) are corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angle \((4x + 11)^\circ\) is given.
- The angle \((8x + 1)^\circ\) is also given.
- These angles are equal because they are corresponding angles of parallel lines.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(x\) such that \(a \parallel b\).
- Since the angles are already equal due to the parallel lines, we need to solve for \(x\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallel lines and the corresponding angles.
- The angles must be equal for the lines to be parallel.
