STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2641
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle A B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A, B, C \).
- Side \( AB \) is labeled with the expression \( 2x - 15 \) degrees.
- Side \( BC \) is labeled with the expression \( x - 5 \) degrees.
- The sum of the internal angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
- External angle at vertex \( C \) is marked as \( 148^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The external angle at \( C \) is \( 148^\circ \), which means the interior angle \( \angle ACB \) is supplementary to this angle, so it must be \( 180^\circ - 148^\circ = 32^\circ \).
- Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle BAC + \angle ACB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  \angle BAC + 32^\circ + (x - 5) = 180^\circ
  \]

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- From the equation above, we have:
  \[
  \angle BAC + 32^\circ + (x - 5) = 180^\circ
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \angle BAC + x - 5 + 32 = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle BAC + x + 27 = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle BAC = 180^\circ - x - 27
  \]
  \[
  \angle BAC = 153^\circ - x
  \]

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle ABC \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, angles, and the relationship between the angles.
