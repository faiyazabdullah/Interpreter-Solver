STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2584
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 4 = 101. Find the measure of \angle 6.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple lines, points, and angles labeled.
- Points labeled are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- Lines are labeled as m, n, p, q.
- Angles are numbered from 1 to 8.
- Some angles are marked with right angle symbols.
- Visible measurements include:
  - ∠4 = 101°
  - ∠6 appears to be adjacent to ∠4.
- Lines seem to intersect at various points forming triangles and quadrilaterals.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure includes several triangles and quadrilaterals.
- ∠4 is a right angle (90°) because it is marked with a right angle symbol.
- ∠6 is adjacent to ∠4.
- Lines appear to form intersecting lines and possibly parallel lines in some parts of the figure.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠4 = 101°.
- No other specific lengths or angles are explicitly given in the image except for ∠4.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠6.
- Since ∠6 is adjacent to ∠4, we need to consider the relationship between these two angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the relationships and constraints observed in the diagram.
- The goal is to capture the geometric properties and relationships without solving the problem directly.
