STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2971
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram to find b.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram XYZW.
- Points X, Y, Z, W are labeled.
- Line segments XY, YZ, WZ, WX are drawn.
- The lengths of line segments are labeled as follows:
  - XY = 3a + 7
  - YZ = 2b
  - WX = b + 11
  - WZ = 4a

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Parallelogram XYZW has opposite sides parallel and equal.
- Therefore, XY = WZ and YZ = WX.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of XY = 3a + 7
- Length of WZ = 4a
- Length of YZ = 2b
- Length of WX = b + 11

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( b \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram and the relationships between its sides.
