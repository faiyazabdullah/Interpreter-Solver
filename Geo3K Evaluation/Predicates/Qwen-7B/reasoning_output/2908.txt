STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2908
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a right triangle \( \triangle JKL \) with vertices \( J, K, L \).
- The right angle is indicated at vertex \( J \).
- Side \( JK \) is marked as 20 units.
- Side \( JL \) is marked as 5 units.
- Side \( KL \) is marked as \( z \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle JKL \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( J \).
- Sides \( JK \) and \( JL \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( KL \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( JK = 20 \) units (given)
- \( JL = 5 \) units (given)
- \( KL = z \) (unknown)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( z \), which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle JKL \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and the relationship between sides.
