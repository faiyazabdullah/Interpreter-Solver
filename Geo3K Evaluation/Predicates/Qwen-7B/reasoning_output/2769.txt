STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2769
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Angles at vertices A and C are marked as 100° and 100° respectively.
- Angle at vertex B is marked as 25x°.
- Angle at vertex D is marked as 10y°.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°.
- The given angles are 100°, 100°, 25x°, and 10y°.
- Since the sum of the angles must be 360°, we have:
  \[
  100 + 100 + 25x + 10y = 360
  \]
- Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  25x + 10y = 160
  \]
- We need to determine if the quadrilateral can be a parallelogram.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific lengths are given for sides AB, BC, CD, or DA.
- The angles are the primary focus for determining if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( x \) so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- For a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, opposite angles must be equal.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles and the relationship that makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram.
- We will use the equation derived from the sum of angles.
