STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2571
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cyclic quadrilateral \(EFGH\) inscribed in a circle with center \(C\).
- Points \(E\), \(F\), \(G\), and \(H\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- The circle's center is denoted as \(C\).
- Angles \(EFC\) and \(EHG\) are given as \(10x - 4\) degrees.
- Angles \(FEG\) and \(FHG\) are given as \(8x + 6\) degrees.
- The diagram does not show any right angles, parallel lines, or specific lengths for sides.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(EFGH\) is a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles sum to \(180^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle EFC + \angle EGH = 180^\circ\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(\angle EFC = 10x - 4\)
- \(\angle EGH = 180 - (10x - 4)\)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).
- To solve for \(x\), we need to use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the cyclic quadrilateral and its properties.
- Must include the given angle expressions and their relationships.
