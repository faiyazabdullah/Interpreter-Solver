STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2802
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle C A D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex D, indicating ∠ADC is 92°.
- Line segments AD, DC, CB, and BA are connected.
- Points D and C appear to be collinear with line segment BC, suggesting DC is a horizontal line segment.
- The right angle at D implies CD is perpendicular to DA.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD appears to be a trapezoid due to the right angle at D.
- Line segment DC is horizontal and perpendicular to DA.
- Line segment BC extends horizontally from C to B.
- Angle ADC is marked as 92°, which implies ∠ADC is obtuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific lengths or angles are explicitly marked except for ∠ADC being 92°.
- We need to find m∠CAD.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle CAD.
- Since we do not have enough information about lengths or additional angles to determine ∠CAD directly, we need to infer relationships based on the given data.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, right angle, and the relationship between angles.
