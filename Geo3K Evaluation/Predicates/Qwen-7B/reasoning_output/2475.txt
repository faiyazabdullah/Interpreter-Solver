STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2475
================================================================================
QUESTION: If m \angle 5 = 7 x - 5 and m \angle 4 = 2 x + 23, find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two lines \(m\) and \(l\).
- There are angles labeled \( \angle 4 \), \( \angle 5 \), and others.
- The angles \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are adjacent and form a straight line because they add up to 180 degrees.
- There are specific angle measures given: \( m \angle 5 = 7x - 5 \) and \( m \angle 4 = 2x + 23 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are adjacent angles forming a straight line, they sum up to 180 degrees.
- Therefore, we have the relationship: 
  \[
  m \angle 4 + m \angle 5 = 180^\circ
  \]

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- From the given expressions:
  \[
  m \angle 5 = 7x - 5
  \]
  \[
  m \angle 4 = 2x + 23
  \]

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the value of \( x \) such that:
  \[
  m \angle 4 + m \angle 5 = 180^\circ
  \]

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to set up the equation based on the relationship between the angles.

\[
(2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
\]

Let's simplify this equation to solve for \( x \).

\[
2x + 23 + 7x - 5 = 180
\]
\[
9x + 18 = 180
\]
\[
9x = 162
\]
\[
x = 18
\]
