STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2496
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center G and diameter AD.
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on the circle.
- Segment AD is a diameter, so it passes through the center G.
- Segments AC and BD intersect at point E.
- The lengths of segments AE and EC are labeled as \(x\).
- The length of segment BE is labeled as 4.
- The length of segment EC is labeled as 9.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Segment AD is a diameter of the circle.
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on the circle, making them concyclic.
- Segments AC and BD intersect at point E.
- The length of segment BE is given as 4.
- The length of segment EC is given as 9.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of segment BE = 4
- Length of segment EC = 9
- We need to find the length of segment AE.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of segment AE.
- Since AD is a diameter, triangle AEC forms a right triangle with the right angle at E.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the diameter, the segments, and the intersection point.
- We will use the fact that the total length of the diameter AD is the sum of AE and EC.
