STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2872
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of m \angle 1.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a central angle labeled as \(218^\circ\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- There is no right angle or perpendicularity indicated.
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 1\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The angle subtended by arc \(BCD\) at the center of the circle is \(218^\circ\).
- Since the full circle is \(360^\circ\), the angle subtended by arc \(BCD\) at point \(A\) (which is the inscribed angle) will be half of the central angle.
- The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
- Therefore, \(\angle 1\) is half of \(218^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The central angle \(218^\circ\) is given.
- \(\angle 1\) is calculated as half of \(218^\circ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 1\).
- We need to find \(\frac{218^\circ}{2}\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the central angle, and the inscribed angle relationship.
