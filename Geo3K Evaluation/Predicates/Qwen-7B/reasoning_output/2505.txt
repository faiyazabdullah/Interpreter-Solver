STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2505
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the rhombus.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at point E, dividing it into four right triangles.
- The lengths of the diagonals are given as 12 ft and 7 ft.
- The diagonals are marked with right-angle symbols.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular to each other.
- The diagonals bisect each other at point E.
- The diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of diagonal AC is 12 ft.
- The length of diagonal BD is 7 ft.
- The diagonals are perpendicular, so they form right angles at point E.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- To find the area, we need to use the formula for the area of a rhombus, which is half the product of its diagonals.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, its diagonals, and the area calculation.
