STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2907
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle J K L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with several points and lines.
- Points: J, L, K, M, A, B, C.
- Lines: JK, KL, LM, JM, AB, BC.
- Angles: ∠JLM, ∠JKL, ∠KLM.
- Visible measurement: ∠JKL = 37°.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is formed with vertices J, K, L.
- Triangle JKM is formed with vertices J, K, M.
- Triangle KLM is formed with vertices K, L, M.
- ∠JKL is given as 37°.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠JKL = 37° (given).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for m∠JKL.
- We need to represent the angle ∠JKL directly without solving it.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle and the specific angle.
