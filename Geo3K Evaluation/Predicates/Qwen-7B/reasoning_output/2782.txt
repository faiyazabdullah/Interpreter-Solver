STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2782
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side BC is marked as \(14\sqrt{3}\).
- Side AC is marked as \(x\).
- Angle BAC is marked as 30 degrees.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C indicating that angle BCA is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.
- Side BC is perpendicular to side AC.
- Side AB forms a 30-degree angle with side BC.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse of the triangle formed by sides BC and AC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BC = \(14\sqrt{3}\).
- Length of AC = \(x\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AC (\(x\)).
- This requires using trigonometric relationships in the right triangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, the right angle, the lengths of sides, and the relationship involving the sine function.
