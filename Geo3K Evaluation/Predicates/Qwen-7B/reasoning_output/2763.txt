STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2763
================================================================================
QUESTION: A C is a diagonal of rhombus A B C D. If m \angle C D E is 116, what is m \angle A C D?

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
- Diagonal \(AC\) is labeled as a diagonal of the rhombus.
- Point \(E\) is labeled outside the rhombus such that \(\angle CDE = 6^\circ\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, implying all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel.
- \(AC\) is a diagonal of the rhombus.
- Since \(E\) is positioned outside the rhombus, it forms a triangle \(CDE\) where \(\angle CDE = 6^\circ\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurement \(\angle CDE = 6^\circ\) is given.
- The goal is to find \(\angle ACD\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to determine \(\angle ACD\).
- In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles they form.
- Since \(AC\) is a diagonal, it bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(\angle BCD\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rhombus and its diagonal.
- Represent the given angle \(\angle CDE\).
- Utilize the property that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles.
