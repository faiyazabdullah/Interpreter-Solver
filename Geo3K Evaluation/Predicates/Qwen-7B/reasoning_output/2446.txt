STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2446
================================================================================
QUESTION: M C = 7, R M = 4, and A T = 16. Find M B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are labeled.
- Lines \( AM \) and \( BM \) intersect at point \( M \).
- Point \( M \) lies on line segment \( BC \).
- Lengths \( RM = 4 \), \( MC = 7 \), and \( AT = 16 \) are marked.
- No right angles or perpendicular lines are marked.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point \( M \) appears to divide line segment \( BC \) into segments \( RM \) and \( MC \).
- Length \( RM = 4 \) and \( MC = 7 \), implying \( BM = BC - RM = BC - 4 \).
- Segment \( AT \) is marked, suggesting it might be related to some geometric property like a median, altitude, or cevian.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - \( RM = 4 \)
  - \( MC = 7 \)
  - \( AT = 16 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( MB \).
- Since \( M \) divides \( BC \) and \( MC = 7 \), we need to determine \( BM \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the division of \( BC \), and the given lengths.
- The relationships involve dividing a line segment and the length of a specific segment.
