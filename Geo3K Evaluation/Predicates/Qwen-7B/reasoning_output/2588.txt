STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2588
================================================================================
QUESTION: m \angle 3 = x - 12 and m \angle 6 = 72. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple points, lines, and angles labeled.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G are labeled.
- Lines are drawn connecting these points, forming several angles.
- Angles are labeled as ∠1, ∠2, ∠3, ∠4, ∠5, ∠6, ∠7, ∠8.
- The measure of ∠3 is given as \(x - 12\).
- The measure of ∠6 is given as 72 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- There are no explicit relationships between the lines or angles indicated in the image.
- The problem focuses on the measurement of ∠3 and ∠6.
- The relationship between ∠3 and ∠6 needs to be determined to solve for \(x\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠3 = \(x - 12\).
- ∠6 = 72°.
- The sum of angles around a point is 360°, but there is no direct connection between ∠3 and ∠6 that can be immediately derived from the given information.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(x\) such that ∠3 = \(x - 12\) and ∠6 = 72°.
- The relationship between ∠3 and ∠6 is not directly provided, so we need to infer or assume that ∠6 and ∠3 are related through a common geometric property or configuration.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Since ∠6 is a known angle and ∠3 is expressed in terms of \(x\), we need to express the relationship between them.
- We will use the given measurements to form a predicate that captures the relationship between ∠3 and ∠6.
