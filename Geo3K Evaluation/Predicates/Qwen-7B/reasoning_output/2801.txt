STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2801
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle A C D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Angles ABD and ADC are marked as 20째 and 49째 respectively.
- Side AD is marked as 13 units.
- Side CD is marked as 10 units.
- Angle ADC is marked as 49째.
- Angle BAD is marked as 59째.
- Side AB is marked as \(3y - 8\) units.
- Side BC is marked as \(2x + 7\) units.
- Point F is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Parallelogram ABCD implies opposite sides are equal: AB = CD and AD = BC.
- Diagonals AC and BD intersect at point F.
- Angles BAD and BCD are supplementary.
- Angles BDA and BDC are supplementary.
- Angles ABC and ADC are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 13 units (given).
- CD = 10 units (given).
- AB = 3y - 8 units.
- BC = 2x + 7 units.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(m\angle ACD\).
- We need to use the properties of parallelograms to determine the measure of angle ACD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, angles, sides, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
