STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2629
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 9 = 75. Find the measure of \angle 6.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a geometric figure with multiple lines, angles, and points.
- There are two triangles, ΔLMN and ΔMNP, with vertices labeled accordingly.
- Line segments are labeled with lengths and points are marked with small red dots.
- Angles are labeled with numbers near the vertices.
- Lines m and n appear to be perpendicular to each other.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle LMN has a right angle at M (angle 5).
- Triangle MNP appears to have a right angle at N (angle 8).
- Line segments m and n intersect at point P.
- There seems to be no explicit indication of parallelism or perpendicularity between specific line segments.
- Angles 6 and 9 are adjacent and form part of the same line segment MP.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurement of angle 9 is given as 75 degrees.
- No numerical measurements are explicitly stated for the sides of the triangles or angles other than angle 9.
- The relationship between angles 6 and 9 needs to be determined based on the given angle 9.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 6.
- The relationship between angles 6 and 9 must be established to find angle 6.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, angles, and their relationships.
- Must ensure all visible geometric constraints and properties are captured.
