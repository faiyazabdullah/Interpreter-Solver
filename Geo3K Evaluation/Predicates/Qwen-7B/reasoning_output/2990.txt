STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2990
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60. Find the measure of \angle 8.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a complex geometric figure with multiple triangles, lines, and angles.
- Points are labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W.
- Lines are labeled as m, n, l, p, q.
- Angles are labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- Measurements are given for some angles: \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure contains multiple triangles, including triangles with labeled angles.
- The angles 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 form specific relationships within the larger geometric structure.
- The given angles \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \) suggest that they might be part of a larger triangle or a combination of triangles forming a specific geometric configuration.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The specific angles provided (\( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \)) are key pieces of information.
- These angles could be parts of larger triangles or angles within a specific geometric formation.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( m\angle 8 \).
- To find \( m\angle 8 \), we need to use the given angles and the relationships between the angles and the triangles they belong to.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the given angles, the relationships between them, and the geometric configurations they belong to.
- Since the exact relationships between the angles are not explicitly provided, we will focus on the given angles and their possible configurations within the larger figure.
