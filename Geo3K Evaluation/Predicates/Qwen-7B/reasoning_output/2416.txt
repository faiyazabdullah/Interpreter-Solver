STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2416
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple angles and lines.
- Angles are labeled with expressions involving \(y\): \((8y + 2)^\circ\) and \((25y - 20)^\circ\).
- Lines are connected at points forming angles.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The angles at point \(B\) form a straight line.
- The sum of the angles around point \(B\) should equal \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angle expressions involve a variable \(y\).
- The equation formed by the sum of these angles will be used to solve for \(y\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \(y\).
- The relationship between the angles around point \(B\) needs to be solved to determine \(y\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the angles and their sum.
- Use the sum of angles around a point property to form the equation.
