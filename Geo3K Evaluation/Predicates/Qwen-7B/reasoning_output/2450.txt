STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2450
================================================================================
QUESTION: A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix, on to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is labeled as \(150x + 91\).
- Side BC is labeled as \(110x + 53\).
- Side AC is labeled as \(73.8x\).
- There are no right angles or specific markings indicating perpendicularity or parallelism between the sides.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is not a right triangle since there are no right angle symbols or perpendicular markings.
- The lengths of the sides are expressed as algebraic expressions, suggesting a linear relationship but not necessarily forming a geometric pattern like a rectangle or a parallelogram.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The lengths of sides AB, BC, and AC are given as \(150x + 91\), \(110x + 53\), and \(73.8x\) respectively.
- The total trip distance from Des Moines to Phoenix, then to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines is given as 3482 miles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta.
- The total distance traveled is the sum of distances AB, BC, and CA.
- The formula for the total distance is:
  \[
  AB + BC + CA = 3482
  \]
- Substitute the given lengths into the equation:
  \[
  (150x + 91) + (110x + 53) + 73.8x = 3482
  \]

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the lengths of the sides, and the total distance equation.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
