STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2837
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find a in the given parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram labeled WXZY.
- The vertices are W, X, Y, and Z.
- There is a diagonal intersection point labeled A.
- Side WX is marked as 10 units.
- Side XY is marked as 2 units.
- Side XZ is marked as \(a - 7\) units.
- Side WZ is marked as \(2b - 6\) units.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- WXZY is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides are equal: WX = ZY and XY = WZ.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 10 units (given).
- XY = 2 units (given).
- XZ = \(a - 7\) units.
- WZ = \(2b - 6\) units.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(a\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, side lengths, and the relationship between the sides.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
