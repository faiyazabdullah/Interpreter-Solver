STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2612
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure consisting of two parallel lines labeled as AD and EF.
- Points H, G, and I lie on the top line AD, while points M, N, and L lie on the bottom line EF.
- The lines AD and EF are parallel.
- Points H and M, as well as points G and N, as well as points I and L, are connected by horizontal lines.
- There are expressions given for lengths: \(20 - 5x\), \(2x + 6\), \(\frac{3}{5}y + 2\), and \(y\).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines AD and EF are parallel.
- Horizontal lines connecting H-M, G-N, and I-L are parallel to each other due to the parallelism of AD and EF.
- The expressions \(20 - 5x\), \(2x + 6\), \(\frac{3}{5}y + 2\), and \(y\) represent lengths of segments on the respective lines.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The lengths \(20 - 5x\), \(2x + 6\), \(\frac{3}{5}y + 2\), and \(y\) are numerical values representing segment lengths.
- The goal is to find the value of \(y\).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(y\).
- We need to use the parallelism and the given expressions to find the value of \(y\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelism of AD and EF.
- Represent the expressions given for lengths.
