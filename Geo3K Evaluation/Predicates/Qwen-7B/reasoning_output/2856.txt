STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2856
================================================================================
QUESTION: The segment is tangent to the circle. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with a tangent segment from point \( B \) to the circle centered at \( A \).
- Point \( B \) lies on the circle.
- Line \( BD \) is tangent to the circle at point \( D \).
- \( AD = 18 \).
- \( DC = 30 \).
- \( x \) represents the length of segment \( AB \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
- \( AB \) is one leg of the triangle.
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
- Since \( BD \) is tangent to the circle at \( D \), \( BD \perp AD \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AD = 18 \).
- \( DC = 30 \).
- The total length \( AC = AD + DC = 18 + 30 = 48 \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AB \).
- This requires applying the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABD \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, tangent segment, lengths, and the relationship between sides.
- Must include the tangent property and the Pythagorean theorem application.
