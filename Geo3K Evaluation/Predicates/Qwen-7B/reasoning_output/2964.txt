STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2964
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a rectangle \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The rectangle has a right angle at each corner.
- There are two triangles formed by drawing perpendiculars from point \(D\) to line segment \(AB\) and from point \(C\) to line segment \(AB\).
- The triangle \(ADZ\) is a right triangle with \(\angle Z = 30^\circ\).
- The triangle \(BCE\) is a right triangle with \(\angle E = 45^\circ\).
- The lengths of segments are given as follows:
  - \(AD = x\)
  - \(ZD = y\)
  - \(BC = 6\)
  - The hypotenuse of triangle \(ADZ\) is 8.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(ADZ\) is a right triangle with \(\angle Z = 30^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle A = 60^\circ\) and \(\angle D = 90^\circ\).
- Triangle \(BCE\) is a right triangle with \(\angle E = 45^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle C = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle B = 45^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of \(AD\) is \(x\).
- The length of \(ZD\) is \(y\).
- The length of \(BC\) is 6.
- The length of the hypotenuse \(ADZ\) is 8.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(ZD\), which is \(y\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the right triangles, the angles, and the given lengths.
- We will use the trigonometric relationships in the right triangles to find the length of \(ZD\).
