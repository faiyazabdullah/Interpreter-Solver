STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2456
================================================================================
QUESTION: If m \widehat F E = 118, m \widehat A B = 108, m \angle E G B = 52, and m \angle E F B = 30, find m \widehat C F.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a circle with center G.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, and F lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Angles ∠FEG and ∠ABG are labeled.
- Angle ∠EGB is labeled as 52 degrees.
- Angle ∠EFB is labeled as 30 degrees.
- Arcs and angles are marked, but no specific lengths or measures are given for arcs or sides.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The circle has center G.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, and F are on the circumference.
- Angles ∠FEG and ∠ABG are related through the circle's properties.
- ∠EGB = 52 degrees.
- ∠EFB = 30 degrees.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠EGB = 52 degrees.
- ∠EFB = 30 degrees.
- These angles are given and need to be used to find ∠CFE.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc CF.
- We need to use the given angles and circle properties to find ∠CFE.
- Since ∠EGB and ∠EFB are given, we can infer some properties about the circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent the given angles.
- Use the circle's properties to find ∠CFE.
