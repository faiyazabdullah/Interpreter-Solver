STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2738
================================================================================
QUESTION: Express the ratio of \tan L as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \(JKL\) with vertices labeled \(J\), \(K\), and \(L\).
- Side \(JK\) is marked as 13 units.
- Side \(KL\) is marked as 5 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(K\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \(JKL\) is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex \(K\).
- Side \(JK\) is the hypotenuse.
- Side \(KL\) is one of the legs of the triangle.
- Side \(JL\) is the other leg of the triangle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(JK = 13\) units (given).
- \(KL = 5\) units (given).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the tangent of angle \(L\).
- To find \(\tan L\), we need to use the definition of tangent, which is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side relative to angle \(L\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, lengths, and relationships involving the tangent function.
- We will focus on extracting the necessary geometric relationships from the diagram.
