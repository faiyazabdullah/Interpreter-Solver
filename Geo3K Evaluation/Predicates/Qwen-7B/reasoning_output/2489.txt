STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2489
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle R.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral PQRT with vertices labeled P, Q, R, T.
- Angles at vertices P, Q, R, and T are marked as \(x^\circ\), \((2x + 5)^\circ\), \(x^\circ\), and \((2x + 7)^\circ\) respectively.
- No specific geometric shapes like parallelogram, rectangle, etc., are explicitly marked or implied.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a quadrilateral PQRT with four angles.
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles at vertices P and T are both \(x^\circ\).
- The angles at vertices Q and R are \((2x + 5)^\circ\) and \((2x + 7)^\circ\) respectively.
- The equation for the sum of the angles in the quadrilateral is:
  \[
  x + x + (2x + 5) + (2x + 7) = 360^\circ
  \]

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(m \angle R\).
- Since \(m \angle R = 2x + 7\), we need to solve for \(x\) first and then substitute it into this expression.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to express the relationship between the angles and the sum of the quadrilateral's angles.
- The equation derived from the sum of the angles will be used to find \(x\).
