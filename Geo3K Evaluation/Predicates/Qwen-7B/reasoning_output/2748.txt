STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2748
================================================================================
QUESTION: Which of the following facts would be sufficient to prove that line d is parallel to X Z?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, Z.
- Line d intersects the triangle at point Y.
- Lines BX and CZ are extended.
- Angles at vertices Y and Z are labeled as 1 and 3 respectively.
- Angles at vertices X and Z are labeled as 2 and 3 respectively.
- There are no specific measurements or labels for lengths or angles.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is formed.
- Line d intersects triangle XYZ at point Y.
- Angles at vertices Y and Z are labeled as 1 and 3 respectively.
- Angles at vertices X and Z are labeled as 2 and 3 respectively.
- There are no specific constraints like parallelism or perpendicularity indicated.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical values are given in the diagram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks whether line d is parallel to XZ.
- To determine if d is parallel to XZ, we need to check if alternate interior angles, corresponding angles, or consecutive interior angles are equal.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the intersection point, and the angles formed.
