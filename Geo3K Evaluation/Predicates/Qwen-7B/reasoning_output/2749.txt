STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2749
================================================================================
QUESTION: If Z P = 4 x - 9 and P Y = 2 x + 5, find Z X.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- Points P and Q are marked within the rectangle, specifically inside the diagonal line connecting W to Y and X to Z respectively.
- Line segments WP, PX, PQ, and QY are drawn.
- ZP = 4x - 9 and PY = 2x + 5 are given.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- WP and PX form part of the diagonal PWX.
- PQ connects points P and Q within the rectangle.
- The lengths of ZP and PY are given in terms of x.
- The rectangle implies that WX and YZ are equal, and WZ and XY are equal.
- The diagonals of the rectangle intersect at point P, dividing them into two equal parts.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ZP = 4x - 9
- PY = 2x + 5

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find ZP given the expressions for ZP and PY.
- Since ZP and PY are parts of the diagonal PWX, the sum of ZP and PY should equal the length of the diagonal PX.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to express the relationship between ZP and PY.
- The total length of the diagonal PX can be expressed as the sum of ZP and PY.
- The length of the diagonal PX can also be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem if we consider the rectangle's dimensions.
