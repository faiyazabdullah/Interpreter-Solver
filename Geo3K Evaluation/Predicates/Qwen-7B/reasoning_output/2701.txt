STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2701
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram W X Y Z to find m \angle X Y Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram labeled WXZY.
- The vertices are labeled as W, X, Y, and Z.
- There is an angle marked at vertex W, measuring 105 degrees.
- Sides WX and XY have lengths 24 units and 28 units respectively.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since WXZY is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Therefore, WX = XY = 24 units and WZ = YX = 28 units.
- Adjacent angles in a parallelogram sum up to 180 degrees.
- Thus, angle XYZ is supplementary to angle WXY.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 24 units
- XY = 28 units
- Angle WXY = 105 degrees

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the measure of angle XYZ.
- Since angle WXY and angle XYZ are adjacent angles in a parallelogram and they sum up to 180 degrees, we can calculate angle XYZ.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram and its properties.
- We will also represent the relationship between the angles.
