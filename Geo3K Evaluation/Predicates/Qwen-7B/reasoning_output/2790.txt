STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2790
================================================================================
QUESTION: U J = 9, V J = 3, and Z T = 18. Find S V.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral UVST with vertices U, V, T, and S.
- Points U, V, T, and S are marked.
- Lines UT and VS are drawn with specific lengths indicated.
- The quadrilateral appears to have some symmetry or relationships implied by the parallel markings.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines UT and VS are marked as parallel, indicating that UVST could be a parallelogram or related to one.
- The lengths UT = 9 and VS are not specified, but we know UV = 3.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- UV = 3
- UT = 9
- No explicit length for VS is given, but it might be inferred from symmetry or other relationships.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find SV.
- Since SV is not marked with a specific length and no other lengths are given, it suggests we need to infer or use the given lengths to deduce SV.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallel lines and the lengths given.
- We also need to consider the geometric properties of the figure, such as whether it forms a parallelogram or similar structure.
