STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2632
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, \triangle A B C \sim \triangle D E F. B G is a median of \triangle A B C, and E H is a median of \triangle D E F. Find E H if B C = 30, B G = 15, and E F = 15.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure contains two triangles: \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DEF\).
- \(\triangle ABC\) has vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- \(\triangle DEF\) has vertices \(D\), \(E\), and \(F\).
- \(BG\) is a median of \(\triangle ABC\).
- \(EH\) is a median of \(\triangle DEF\).
- \(BC = 30\).
- \(BG = 15\).
- \(EF = 15\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF\) (similar triangles).
- \(BG\) is a median of \(\triangle ABC\).
- \(EH\) is a median of \(\triangle DEF\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(BC = 30\).
- \(BG = 15\).
- \(EF = 15\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the length of \(EH\).
- Given that the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding medians is equal to the ratio of the corresponding sides.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and medians.
- Capture the similarity relationship.
- Use the similarity ratio to find \(EH\).
