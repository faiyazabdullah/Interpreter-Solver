STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2707
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram labeled ABCD with vertices A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 15 inches.
- Side BC is marked as 13 inches.
- Side AD is marked as 15 inches.
- Side CD is marked as 13 inches.
- There is a dashed line from point C to point E, indicating a perpendicular line dropped from C to AB, intersecting it at point E.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD forms a parallelogram.
- AB || CD and AD || BC.
- AB = CD = 15 inches.
- BC = AD = 13 inches.
- CE ‚ä• AB.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15 inches.
- BC = 13 inches.
- CE = 5 inches (given).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, perpendicular line, lengths, and the area formula.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
