REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle GHI with vertices G, H, I.
- Side GH is marked as 9 units.
- Side GK is marked as 6 units.
- Side KJ is marked as 4 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex H.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle GHI is a right triangle with right angle at vertex H.
- Side GH is perpendicular to side HI.
- Side HI is perpendicular to side GK.
- Side GK is perpendicular to side KJ.
- The right angle is at vertex H.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GH = 9 units (given).
- GK = 6 units (given).
- KJ = 4 units (given).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length GI.
- Since GHI is a right triangle and we have the lengths of two sides, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find GI.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
