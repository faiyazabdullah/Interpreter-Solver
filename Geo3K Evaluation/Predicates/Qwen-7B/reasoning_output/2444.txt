STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2444
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABD with vertices labeled A, B, D.
- Side AB is marked as 40 units.
- Side BD is marked as 22 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B, indicating that angle ABD is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex B.
- Side AB is perpendicular to side BD.
- Side AD is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 40 units (given)
- BD = 22 units (given)
- AD length is what needs to be found.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AD.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
