STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2752
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60. Find the measure of \angle 6.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a geometric figure with various shapes, points, lines, and angles.
- Visible measurements include \( m \angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m \angle 3 = 60^\circ \).
- No right angle symbols, parallel marks, congruent marks, etc., are explicitly marked.
- Points are labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T.
- Lines are labeled as \( m \), \( n \), \( l \), etc.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- No specific geometric relationships like parallelism, perpendicularity, or congruence are explicitly marked.
- Angles \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are given with measures.
- Other angles such as \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 4 \), \( \angle 5 \), \( \angle 6 \), \( \angle 7 \), \( \angle 8 \) are implied but not measured or marked.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( m \angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
- \( m \angle 3 = 60^\circ \)
- No other lengths or angles are marked in the diagram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 6 \).
- To find \( \angle 6 \), we need to use the properties of triangles and the given angle measures.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the angles, point labels, and the given angle measures.
- We will focus on the relationships between the angles and the fact that they form a triangle.
