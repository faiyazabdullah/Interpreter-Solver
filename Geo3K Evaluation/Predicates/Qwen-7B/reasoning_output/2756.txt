STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2756
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of \triangle W Z X, if \triangle W Z X \sim \triangle S R T, S T = 6, W X = 5, and the perimeter of \triangle S R T = 15.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles labeled as \(\triangle WZX\) and \(\triangle SRT\).
- \(\triangle WZX\) has vertices \(W, Z, X\) with sides labeled \(WX = 5\) and \(XZ\).
- \(\triangle SRT\) has vertices \(S, R, T\) with sides labeled \(SR = 6\) and \(RT\).
- Both triangles share the similarity property indicated by the symbol \(\sim\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\triangle WZX \sim \triangle SRT\), meaning they are similar triangles.
- The ratio of corresponding sides is constant.
- Since \(WX = 5\) and \(SR = 6\), the scale factor between \(\triangle WZX\) and \(\triangle SRT\) is \(\frac{5}{6}\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given \(WX = 5\).
- Given \(SR = 6\).
- The perimeter of \(\triangle SRT\) is given as 15.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\).
- Using the similarity ratio, we need to find the perimeter of \(\triangle WZX\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, their similarity, and the given measurements.
- Ensure all relevant relationships are captured.
