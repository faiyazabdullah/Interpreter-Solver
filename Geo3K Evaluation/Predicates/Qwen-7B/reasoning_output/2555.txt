STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2555
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle J K L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram JKLM with vertices labeled J, K, L, M.
- Side JK is labeled as \(2b + 3\).
- Side LM is labeled as 45.
- Side KM is labeled as 21.
- Angle JLK is labeled as 70째.
- Angle JKM is labeled as 30째.
- Point R lies inside the parallelogram, forming diagonals JR and KR.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a parallelogram, meaning opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Diagonals intersect at point R.
- Angles JKL and JML are supplementary because they form a straight line with angle JLK and JKM.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = \(2b + 3\)
- LM = 45
- KM = 21
- Angle JLK = 70째
- Angle JKM = 30째

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle JKL.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the specific angle required.
