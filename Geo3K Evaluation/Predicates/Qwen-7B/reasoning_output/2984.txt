STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2984
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle Y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a quadrilateral labeled WXYZ with vertices W, X, Y, Z.
- Lines WX, XY, YZ, and ZX are present.
- Angles at vertices W, X, Y, and Z are marked with specific measures: \(a\), \(a - 28\), \(\frac{1}{2}a + 8\), and \(a + 2\) respectively.
- Right angle symbols are present at angles W and Z.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXYZ could potentially be a cyclic quadrilateral due to the right angles at W and Z.
- Angles at W and Z sum up to 180 degrees, which supports the possibility of cyclic quadrilateral properties.
- Angles at X and Y are given as \(a - 28\) and \(\frac{1}{2}a + 8\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angle measure at Y is \(a - 28\).
- The angle measure at X is \(\frac{1}{2}a + 8\).
- The sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
- The sum of angles at W and Z is 180 degrees due to the presence of right angles.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m \angle Y\), which is the measure of angle Y in quadrilateral WXYZ.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, angles, and their measures.
- The relationship between the angles and the sum of angles in a quadrilateral will help determine the measure of angle Y.
