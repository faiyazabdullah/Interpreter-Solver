STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2736
================================================================================
QUESTION: The segment is tangent to the circle. Find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \( Z \).
- Two tangents \( WZ \) and \( XZ \) are drawn from point \( Z \) to the circle.
- The lengths of the tangents \( WZ \) and \( XZ \) are given as \( 2x + 9 \) and \( 3x + 6 \) respectively.
- Since the lengths of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal, we have \( WZ = XZ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The tangents \( WZ \) and \( XZ \) are equal because they are radii of the circle from the same external point \( Z \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The lengths of the tangents are \( 2x + 9 \) and \( 3x + 6 \).
- We need to set these lengths equal to each other since they are equal tangents.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the equality of the two tangent lengths.
