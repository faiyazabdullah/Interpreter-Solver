STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2665
================================================================================
QUESTION: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two triangles labeled \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \).
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has vertices \( A, B, C \).
- Triangle \( \triangle DEF \) has vertices \( D, E, F \).
- In \( \triangle ABC \), sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are labeled as 12 units each.
- In \( \triangle ABC \), the side \( AB \) is labeled as \( 2x \).
- In \( \triangle ABC \), the side \( BC \) is labeled as 20 units.
- In \( \triangle DEF \), side \( DF \) is labeled as 12 units.
- In \( \triangle DEF \), side \( EF \) is labeled as 15 units.
- In \( \triangle DEF \), side \( DE \) is labeled as \( y + 4 \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both triangles appear to be similar, as they share corresponding angles.
- Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.
- The similarity implies that the angles in both triangles are the same.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- In \( \triangle ABC \):
  - \( AB = 2x \)
  - \( BC = 20 \)
  - \( AC \) needs to be found.
- In \( \triangle DEF \):
  - \( DF = 12 \)
  - \( EF = 15 \)
  - \( DE = y + 4 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).
- Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the corresponding sides should be equal.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, their sides, and the similarity relationship.
- Ensure that the relationships between the sides are captured correctly.
