STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2743
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
- Side lengths are marked as follows:
  - Side \(AB = 11\) units
  - Side \(BC = 12\) units
  - Side \(AC\) is the unknown side we need to find.
- An angle at vertex \(A\) is marked as \(60^\circ\).
- An angle at vertex \(B\) is marked as \(x^\circ\).
- An angle at vertex \(C\) is marked as an unknown angle, which we denote as \(\theta\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The triangle has one angle marked as \(60^\circ\).
- Since the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\), we can determine the remaining two angles.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Side \(AB = 11\)
- Side \(BC = 12\)
- We need to find the length of side \(AC\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of side \(AC\).
- To solve this, we will use the Law of Cosines since we know two sides and the included angle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, angles, and the relationship involving the cosine of the included angle.
- Ensure all given information and relationships are captured.
