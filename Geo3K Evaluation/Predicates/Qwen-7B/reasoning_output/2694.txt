STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2694
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram M N P R to find m \angle M N P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram MNPR with vertices labeled M, N, P, and R.
- Side MP is marked as \(3x - 4\).
- Side NR is marked as \(2y + 5\).
- Side MR is marked as \(4w - 3\).
- Side PR is marked as \(11.1\).
- Side NP is marked as \(15.4\).
- Angle MNR is labeled as \(33^\circ\).
- Angle MRN is labeled as \(83^\circ\).
- Angle PMR is labeled as \(38^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral MNPR is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
- Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.
- Adjacent angles of a parallelogram sum up to \(180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(MP = 3x - 4\)
- \(NR = 2y + 5\)
- \(MR = 4w - 3\)
- \(PR = 11.1\)
- \(NP = 15.4\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m \angle MNP\).
- To find \(m \angle MNP\), we need to use the properties of the parallelogram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram.
- Capture the given lengths.
- Identify the angles and their relationships within the parallelogram.
