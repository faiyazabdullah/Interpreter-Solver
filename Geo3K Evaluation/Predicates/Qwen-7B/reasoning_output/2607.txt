STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2607
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A, B, C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as \( x + 3 \).
- Side \( BC \) is marked as \( 2x - 8 \).
- Side \( AC \) is marked as 5.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse and its length is given as 5.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths:
  - \( AB = x + 3 \)
  - \( BC = 2x - 8 \)
  - \( AC = 5 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BC \).
- To find \( BC \), we use the Pythagorean theorem since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- The lengths \( AB \) and \( BC \) are variables, so they must be related through the Pythagorean theorem.
