STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2972
================================================================================
QUESTION: U J = 9, V J = 3, and Z T = 18. Find S J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with points, lines, and measurements.
- Points labeled: J, U, T, V, Y, Z, S.
- Lines connecting points: JU, JT, TV, VY, YZ, ZT.
- Measurements provided: UJ = 9, VJ = 3, ZT = 18.
- Right angle symbols are present at point J.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JTV is a right triangle with the right angle at J.
- Line segment JT is a common side in triangles JTV and UJT.
- Triangles JTV and UJT share the same base JT and have equal angles at J.
- Triangles UJT and VTU form a straight line at point T.
- Triangle YZT is a right triangle with the right angle at Y.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- UJ = 9
- VJ = 3
- ZT = 18

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find SJ.
- We need to use the given measurements and relationships between the triangles to determine SJ.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the right triangle JTV.
- Represent the right triangle UJT.
- Represent the right triangle YZT.
- Use the given lengths to establish relationships.
