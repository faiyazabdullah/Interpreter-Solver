STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2466
================================================================================
QUESTION: If A B = 12, A C = 16, and E D = 5, find A E.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are labeled.
- Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.
- The lengths of \( AB \) and \( AC \) are given as 12 and 5 respectively.
- The length of \( BD \) is not explicitly given but can be inferred from the problem statement.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
- \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular to each other.
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 5 \)
- \( AC = 12 \)
- The goal is to find the length of \( AE \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( AE \).
- The problem involves finding the length of a segment in a right triangle given the lengths of two sides.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, its right angle, lengths of the sides, and the relationship between them.
- The predicates should capture the given lengths and the right angle property.
