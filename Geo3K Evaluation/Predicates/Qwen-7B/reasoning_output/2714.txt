STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2714
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Angles at vertices A, B, C, and D are labeled as x°, 2x°, 2x°, and x° respectively.
- All four sides appear to be equal in length.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD appears to be a rhombus because all sides are equal.
- Angles at vertices B and C are both 2x°, indicating symmetry in the figure.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angles at A and D are both x°.
- Angles at B and C are both 2x°.
- Since opposite angles in a rhombus are equal, we have:
  - Angle A + Angle D = 180° → x + x = 180
  - Angle B + Angle C = 180° → 2x + 2x = 180
- Solving for x:
  - 2x + 2x = 180 → 4x = 180 → x = 45°

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle B.
- From our analysis, Angle B = 2x°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, angles, and the relationship between angles.
