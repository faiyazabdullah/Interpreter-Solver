STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2732
================================================================================
QUESTION: A square is inscribed in a circle having a radius of 6 inches. Find the length of the side of the square.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a square inscribed in a circle with a radius of 6 inches.
- Points A, B, C, D are vertices of the square.
- Line segments AB, BC, CD, and DA form the sides of the square.
- The center of the circle is the same point as the center of the square.
- The distance from the center of the circle to any side of the square is equal to half the length of the side of the square.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Square ABCD is inscribed in the circle.
- The center of the circle is also the center of the square.
- The diagonals of the square intersect at the center of the circle.
- The radius of the circle is 6 inches.
- The diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle.
- The diagonal length of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 6 inches.
- The diameter of the circle is twice the radius, so the diagonal of the square is \(2 \times 6 = 12\) inches.
- Since the diagonal of the square forms the diameter of the circle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the side length of the square.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of the side of the square.
- We need to find the side length of the square given its diagonal.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the square, circle, relationship between the diagonal and the side length of the square.
