STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2514
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find K J if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with a right triangle GHJ where G is the right angle vertex.
- Side GJ is marked as 8 units.
- Side GH is marked as 12 units.
- Side HI is marked as 4 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex G.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle GHJ is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex G.
- Side GJ is perpendicular to side GH.
- Side HI is a horizontal line segment extending from point H.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GJ = 8 units (given)
- GH = 12 units (given)
- HI = 4 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of KJ.
- Since KJ is a vertical line segment starting from point K and ending at point J, it represents the length of GJ because K lies on the same vertical line as G and J.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
