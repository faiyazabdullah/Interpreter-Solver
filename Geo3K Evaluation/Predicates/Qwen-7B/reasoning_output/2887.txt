STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2887
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot F, F H \cong F L and F K = 17. Find J G.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at point \( F \).
- Points \( J, H, G, M, K, L, \) and \( N \) lie on the circle.
- \( F \) is the center of the circle.
- \( FH \cong FL \) indicates that segments \( FH \) and \( FL \) are congruent.
- \( FK = 17 \) is given.
- \( GH \) and \( KL \) appear to be diameters of the circle.
- Right angles are marked at points \( H \) and \( L \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( F \) is the center of the circle.
- \( FH \cong FL \) implies \( \triangle FHL \) is isosceles.
- \( GH \) and \( KL \) are diameters of the circle, so they pass through the center \( F \).
- \( \angle FHK \) and \( \angle FLK \) are right angles because \( H \) and \( L \) are endpoints of the diameter \( GH \) and \( KL \) respectively.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( FH = FL \)
- \( FK = 17 \)
- \( GH \) and \( KL \) are diameters, so \( GH = KL = 2 \times \text{radius} \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( JG \).
- Since \( GH \) is a diameter and \( H \) is the midpoint of \( GH \), \( JG \) is the same as \( GH \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent the congruence of segments \( FH \) and \( FL \).
- Represent the diameter \( GH \).
- Represent the right angle at \( H \).
