STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2858
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- The angles at \( B \) and \( A \) are labeled as \( (3x - 15)^{\circ} \) and \( 2x^{\circ} \) respectively.
- The angle at \( C \) is labeled as \( (y^2)^{\circ} \).
- The angle at \( D \) is labeled as \( 68^{\circ} \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has three interior angles summing up to \( 180^{\circ} \).
- The angle at \( D \) is outside the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) and forms a straight line with the angle at \( B \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angle at \( B \) is given as \( (3x - 15)^{\circ} \).
- The angle at \( A \) is given as \( 2x^{\circ} \).
- The angle at \( C \) is given as \( (y^2)^{\circ} \).
- The angle at \( D \) is given as \( 68^{\circ} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question does not ask for specific numerical values but rather the setup of relationships within the triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, angles, and relationships between them.
