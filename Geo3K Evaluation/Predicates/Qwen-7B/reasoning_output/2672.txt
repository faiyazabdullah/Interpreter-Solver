STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2672
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with a triangle ABC and a point D on side BC.
- Side AB is labeled as 30 units.
- Side AC is labeled as 28 units.
- Side AD is labeled as 8 units.
- There are right angle symbols at vertex A and vertex B, indicating right angles at these points.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC has a right angle at vertex B.
- Triangle ABD forms a right triangle at vertex A.
- Triangle ACD forms a right triangle at vertex A.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AB = 30 units.
- Length of AC = 28 units.
- Length of AD = 8 units.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of BD, denoted as y.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangles, right angles, measurements, and relationships involving lengths.
