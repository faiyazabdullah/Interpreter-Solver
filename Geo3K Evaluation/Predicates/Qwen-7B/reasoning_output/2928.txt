STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2928
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find C F if B F bisects \angle A B C and A C \parallel E D, B A = 6, B C = 7.5, A C = 9, and D E = 9.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices labeled \( A, B, C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 6 units.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 7.5 units.
- Side \( AC \) is marked as 9 units.
- \( BF \) bisects \( \angle ABC \).
- \( AC \parallel ED \).
- \( DE \) is marked as 9 units.
- Right angle symbol is present at \( \angle ABC \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
- \( \angle ABC \) is bisected by \( BF \).
- \( AC \parallel ED \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( BA = 6 \)
- \( BC = 7.5 \)
- \( AC = 9 \)
- \( DE = 9 \)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( CF \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and its sides.
- Represent the right angle at \( B \).
- Represent the bisection of \( \angle ABC \) by \( BF \).
- Represent the parallelism of \( AC \) and \( ED \).
- Represent the lengths of the sides.
