STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2975
================================================================================
QUESTION: Tangent M P is drawn to \odot O. Find x if M O = 20.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle \( \triangle OPM \) with vertices labeled \( O \), \( P \), and \( M \).
- Point \( M \) lies on the tangent line passing through point \( P \).
- Line segment \( OM \) is labeled as 20 units.
- Line segment \( PM \) is labeled as 16 units.
- Line segment \( OP \) is labeled as 5 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at point \( P \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle OPM \) is a right triangle with right angle at point \( P \).
- \( PM \) is perpendicular to \( OM \).
- \( OP \) is the radius of the circle centered at \( O \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( OM = 20 \) units (given).
- \( PM = 16 \) units (given).
- \( OP = 5 \) units (given).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents \( OP \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, right angle, radii, and given lengths.
