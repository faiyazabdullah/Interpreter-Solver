STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2940
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \odot X, A B = 30, C D = 30, and m \widehat C Z = 40. Find m \widehat C D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \(X\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) lie on the circle.
- Segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) are equal in length (\(AB = CD = 30\)).
- Angle \(\widehat{CZ}\) is marked as \(40^\circ\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are concyclic (lie on the same circle).
- Segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) are equal, indicating they subtend equal arcs.
- The measure of arc \(\widehat{CZ}\) is \(40^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 30\)
- \(CD = 30\)
- \(\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(\widehat{CZ}\).
- The measure of \(\widehat{CZ}\) is already given as \(40^\circ\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the points, the equal lengths of segments, and the given arc measure.
- The predicates will capture all visible information without solving for the final value of the arc measure.
