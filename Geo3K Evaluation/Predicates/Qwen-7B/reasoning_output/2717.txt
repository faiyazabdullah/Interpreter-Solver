STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2717
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 3 = 43. Find the measure of \angle 11.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with multiple lines, angles, and points.
- There are three labeled lines \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) intersecting at several points.
- Points \(K\), \(M\), \(P\), \(Q\), \(F\), and \(H\) are marked.
- Angles are labeled as \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\).
- Measurement \(m \angle 3 = 43^\circ\) is given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure appears to be a complex geometric construction involving angles and lines.
- No parallel, perpendicular, or congruent relationships are explicitly marked.
- However, we know that \(m \angle 3 = 43^\circ\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The only numerical value provided is \(m \angle 3 = 43^\circ\).
- Other angles and lengths are not explicitly given or measured in the diagram.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 11\).
- Since no direct relationship between \(\angle 11\) and \(\angle 3\) is provided, we cannot determine \(\angle 11\) from the given information alone.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the given angle measurement and the query for \(\angle 11\).
