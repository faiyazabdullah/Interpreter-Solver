STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2487
================================================================================
QUESTION: Circles G, J, and K all intersect at L. If G H = 10, find F H.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three circles labeled G, J, and K.
- These circles intersect at point L.
- There is a line segment GH marked with a length of 10.
- Points B, F, G, H, J, D, C, K, and L are labeled.
- No right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks are visible.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Circles G, J, and K intersect at point L.
- The intersection point L is common to all three circles.
- No specific relationships such as parallelism or perpendicularity are indicated between the circles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length GH is given as 10.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find FH.
- Since no additional geometric relationships or measurements are provided, we cannot determine FH without more information.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circles and their intersection point.
- We need to indicate the given length GH.
- Since the question asks for FH and there is no additional information connecting F and H, we cannot form predicates related to FH.
