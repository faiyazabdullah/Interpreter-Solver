================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Line AB is horizontal, and line CD is also horizontal.
- Line AD is vertical.
- Line BC is perpendicular to both AB and CD.
- Angles ABD and DBC are given as 48° and 39° respectively.
- Right angle symbols are present at points B and C.
- Lines AF, BE, CF, and DE are drawn inside the quadrilateral, creating additional segments and angles.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD has two right angles at B and C, indicating that it might be a rectangle or a combination of rectangles.
- Angles ABD and DBC are given as 48° and 39° respectively, suggesting that angles ABC and ADC are supplementary to these angles.
- Line AB is horizontal, and line CD is also horizontal.
- Line AD is vertical, making angles ABD and DBC complementary to the angles at the endpoints.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical values are explicitly given for lengths or angles within the diagram except for the angles mentioned.
- Angles ABD and DBC are explicitly labeled as 48° and 39° respectively.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle 2.
- Angle 2 is part of the angle formed by lines AD and BC.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, right angles, and the given angles.
- We must ensure that all visible geometric relationships and properties are captured.
