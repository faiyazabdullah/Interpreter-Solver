STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2576
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find X Y of isosceles \triangle X Y Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle XYZ with vertices X, Y, and Z.
- Line segments XY, YZ, and XZ are labeled with expressions involving \(x\): \(2x + 3\), \(4x - 1\), and \(8x - 4\) respectively.
- No right angle symbols, parallel lines, or other special markings are indicated in the diagram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since no special markings (like right angles or parallel lines) are given, we assume that there are no specific relationships like perpendicularity or parallelism among the sides.
- The lengths of the sides are given as algebraic expressions involving \(x\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The lengths of the sides are expressed as linear functions of \(x\).
- We need to find a relationship between these expressions to determine if they could represent a specific geometric figure, such as an isosceles triangle where two sides are equal.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \(XY\).
- To find \(XY\), we need to determine if the triangle is isosceles and then solve for one of the side lengths.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle and its sides.
- We need to check if the triangle is isosceles and identify the lengths of the sides.
