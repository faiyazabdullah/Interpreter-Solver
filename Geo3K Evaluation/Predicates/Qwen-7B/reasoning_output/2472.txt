STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2472
================================================================================
QUESTION: Triangle L M N is equilateral, and M P bisects L N. Find the measure of the side of \triangle L M N.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle LMN with vertices labeled L, M, N
- Side LM is marked as \(3x + 1\)
- Side MN is marked as \(4x - 2\)
- There is a point P on LM such that MP bisects LN
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex L

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle LMN is equilateral, so all sides are equal.
- Since MP bisects LN, LP = PN.
- Since LMP is a right triangle, angles LPM and LMP are complementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LM = \(3x + 1\)
- MN = \(4x - 2\)
- Since LMN is equilateral, LM = MN = LN

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of the side of \(\triangle LMN\).
- We need to find the value of x first.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, equilateral property, lengths, bisection, right angle, and relationships
