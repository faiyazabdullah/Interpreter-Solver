STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2821
================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral A B C D is a rhombus. If A B = 2 x + 3 and B C = x + 7, find C D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
- Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are labeled.
- Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
- The lengths of sides \(AB\) and \(BC\) are given as \(2x + 3\) and \(x + 7\) respectively.
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all four sides are equal in length.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rhombus.
- All sides are congruent.
- Therefore, \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given: \(AB = 2x + 3\).
- Given: \(BC = x + 7\).
- Since \(AB = BC\) in a rhombus, we equate the two expressions:
  \[
  2x + 3 = x + 7
  \]

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find \(CD\).
- Since \(AB = BC\) and both are sides of the rhombus, \(CD\) will also be equal to \(BC\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rhombus and its properties.
- Use the equation from the measurement analysis to find the value of \(x\).
