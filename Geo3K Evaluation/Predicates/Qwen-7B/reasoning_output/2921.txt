STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2921
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle T to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T
- Side RS is marked as \(4\sqrt{3}\) units
- Side RT is marked as \(10\sqrt{3}\) units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex S

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RST is a right triangle with right angle at vertex S
- Sides RS and ST are perpendicular
- Side RT is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RS = \(4\sqrt{3}\) units (given)
- RT = \(10\sqrt{3}\) units (given)
- ST length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of ST
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle RST is a right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
