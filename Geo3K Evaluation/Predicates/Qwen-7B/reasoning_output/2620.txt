STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2620
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 15 units.
- Side \( BC \) is marked as 15 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( AB = 15 \) units (given)
- \( BC = 15 \) units (given)
- We need to find the length of \( AC \).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AC \).
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
