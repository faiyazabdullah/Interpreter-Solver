STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2635
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find T X if E X = 24 and D E = 7.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ADE with vertices labeled A, D, E
- Side AD is marked as 7 units
- Side DE is marked as 24 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex D

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ADE is a right triangle with right angle at D
- Sides AD and DE are perpendicular
- Side AE is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 7 units (given)
- DE = 24 units (given)
- AE length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of AE
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem since triangle ADE is a right triangle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties
