STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2893
================================================================================
QUESTION: Express the ratio of \cos P as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle RQP \).
- Vertex \( Q \) is marked as the right angle.
- \( QR = 15 \)
- \( QP = 17 \)
- \( PR = 8 \)

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle RQP \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( Q \).
- \( QR \) and \( QP \) are perpendicular.
- \( PR \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( QR = 15 \)
- \( QP = 17 \)
- \( PR = 8 \)

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the cosine of angle \( P \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the right triangle, right angle, lengths, and the cosine relationship.
- Must include the right angle property and the lengths involved in the cosine calculation.
