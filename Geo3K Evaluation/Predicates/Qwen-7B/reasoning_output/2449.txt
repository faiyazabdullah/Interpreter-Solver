================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle W.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a pentagon U VWYZ.
- The vertices are labeled U, V, W, X, Y, Z.
- Angles at vertices U, V, W, X, Y, Z are labeled as follows:
  - ∠U = (x - 8)°
  - ∠V = (3x - 11)°
  - ∠W = (x + 8)°
  - ∠X = x°
  - ∠Z = (2x + 7)°

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of interior angles of a pentagon is (n-2) × 180° where n = 5. Therefore, the sum of all interior angles is (5-2) × 180° = 540°.
- The relationship among the angles is:
  - ∠U + ∠V + ∠W + ∠X + ∠Z = 540°.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ∠U = (x - 8)°
- ∠V = (3x - 11)°
- ∠W = (x + 8)°
- ∠X = x°
- ∠Z = (2x + 7)°

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠W, which is ∠W = (x + 8)°.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the pentagon and the sum of its interior angles.
- We also need to express the equation formed by the sum of the angles.
