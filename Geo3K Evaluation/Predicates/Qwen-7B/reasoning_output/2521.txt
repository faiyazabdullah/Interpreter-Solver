STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2521
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x for the equilateral triangle R S T if R S = x + 9, S T = 2 x, and R T = 3 x - 9.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see an equilateral triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T.
- Side RS is marked as \(x + 9\).
- Side ST is marked as \(2x\).
- Side RT is marked as \(3x - 9\).
- All sides are equal in an equilateral triangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RST is an equilateral triangle.
- All three sides are equal.
- Therefore, \(x + 9 = 2x\) and \(x + 9 = 3x - 9\).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(RS = x + 9\)
- \(ST = 2x\)
- \(RT = 3x - 9\)
- Since it is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\).
- To find \(x\), we need to solve the equation \(x + 9 = 2x\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the equilateral triangle, equality of sides, and the equation to solve for \(x\).
