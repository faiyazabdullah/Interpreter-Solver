STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2530
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle K.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram JKLN with vertices labeled J, K, L, N.
- Side JK is marked as 6 units.
- Side JL is marked as 6 units.
- Angle JNL is labeled as 80 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Parallelogram JKLN implies that opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- Therefore, JK = LN and JL = KN.
- Since JK = JL, parallelogram JKLN could also be a rhombus.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of side JK = 6 units.
- Length of side JL = 6 units.
- Angle JNL = 80 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle K.
- Since JKLN is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal.
- Therefore, angle K should be equal to angle JNL, which is 80 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, lengths, and angles.
