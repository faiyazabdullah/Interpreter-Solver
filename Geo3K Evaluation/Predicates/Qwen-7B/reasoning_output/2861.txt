STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2861
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, line l is parallel to line m. Line n intersects both l and m. Which of the following lists includes all of the angles that are supplementary to \angle 1?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \).
- Line \( n \) intersects both \( l \) and \( m \) at points labeled \( E \) and \( G \) respectively.
- Angles are labeled around the intersection points: \( \angle 1 \) at point \( D \), \( \angle 2 \) at point \( F \), \( \angle 3 \) at point \( D \), and so on.
- The figure appears to be a complex geometric construction involving parallel lines and transversals.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel.
- Line \( n \) forms various angles at the intersections.
- The angles around the intersection points appear to be related through supplementary angles and vertical angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific numerical measurements are provided in the diagram.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the angles that are supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallel lines, the angles formed by the intersection of the transversal with the parallel lines, and the supplementary relationships.
