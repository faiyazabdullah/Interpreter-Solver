STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2783
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the length of \widehat J K. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center \( C \).
- There is a diameter \( AJ \) passing through the center \( C \).
- The length of the diameter \( AJ \) is \( 15 \) cm.
- An angle \( \angle CKJ \) is given as \( 105^\circ \).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( AJ \) is a diameter, it passes through the center \( C \).
- Therefore, \( AK = JK \) because they are equal radii of the circle.
- The angle \( \angle CKJ \) is given as \( 105^\circ \).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of the diameter \( AJ \) is \( 15 \) cm.
- Since \( AJ \) is the diameter, the radius \( AC \) and \( CJ \) are both \( 7.5 \) cm.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of arc \( JK \).
- To find the length of arc \( JK \), we need to know the measure of the central angle subtended by arc \( JK \).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the diameter, the radius, and the angle subtended by the arc.
- The length of arc can be calculated using the formula \( \text{Arc Length} = 2\pi r \times \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \).
