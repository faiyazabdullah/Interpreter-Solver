STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2565
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find \tan X.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle XAB \).
- Point \( X \) is at the top left, point \( A \) is at the bottom left, and point \( B \) is at the bottom right.
- The vertical line segment \( AX \) is labeled as 5 units.
- The horizontal line segment \( AB \) is labeled as 12 units.
- The hypotenuse \( XB \) is labeled as 13 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( A \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle XAB \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( A \).
- Sides \( AX \) and \( AB \) are perpendicular.
- Side \( XB \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
- The right angle is formed at vertex \( A \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of \( AX \): 5 units.
- Length of \( AB \): 12 units.
- Length of \( XB \): 13 units (hypotenuse).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( \tan X \).
- To find \( \tan X \), we need the lengths of the opposite side (\( AB \)) and the adjacent side (\( AX \)) relative to angle \( X \).
- However, the tangent of angle \( X \) is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side with respect to angle \( X \), which is not directly asked in the question but inferred from the triangle properties.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and the tangent function relationship.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
