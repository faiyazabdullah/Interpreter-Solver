STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2639
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find Q M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a parallelogram \(MNQP\) with vertices labeled \(M\), \(N\), \(P\), and \(Q\).
- The sides \(MN\) and \(PQ\) are parallel, as indicated by the double-headed arrows.
- The sides \(MQ\) and \(NP\) are also parallel.
- Right angle symbols are present at points \(M\) and \(P\), indicating that \(MN \perp MQ\) and \(NP \perp PQ\).
- The lengths of \(MQ\) and \(NP\) are labeled as \(2x + 2\) and \(4x - 8\) respectively.
- The lengths of \(MN\) and \(PQ\) are both equal to the length of \(MQ\) due to the properties of a parallelogram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a parallelogram.
- \(MN \parallel PQ\) and \(MQ \parallel NP\).
- \(MN \perp MQ\) and \(NP \perp PQ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(MQ = 2x + 2\).
- \(NP = 4x - 8\).
- Since \(MN = PQ\), we have \(MN = PQ = 2x + 2\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(MQ\).
- We need to find the value of \(MQ\) using the given expressions and the properties of the parallelogram.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, right angles, and the given lengths.
- Ensure all necessary relationships are captured.
