STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2418
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle A D C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are labeled with measures.
- Angle \(A\) is \(20^\circ\), angle \(B\) is \(40.1^\circ\), and angle \(C\) is \(32^\circ\).
- The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(F\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.
- Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other at point \(F\).
- The sum of interior angles in a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 9\)
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(AD = 6.86\)
- \(DC = 9\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(BD = 6\)
- \(AF = FC\) because \(F\) is the intersection point of the diagonals of a parallelogram.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of angle \(ADC\).
- To find \(m\angle ADC\), we need to use the properties of the parallelogram and the angles given.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the relationship between the diagonals.
