STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2832
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle 3.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Angles at vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\) are labeled as \(42^\circ\), \(72^\circ\), and \(38^\circ\), respectively.
- There is no indication of a right angle or other specific geometric constraints like parallelism or congruence.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since there are no explicit constraints like parallel lines, right angles, or congruence, we need to focus on the angles provided.
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles at vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\) are given as \(42^\circ\), \(72^\circ\), and \(38^\circ\), respectively.
- Therefore, the remaining angle at vertex \(C\) can be calculated as:
  \[
  360^\circ - (42^\circ + 72^\circ + 38^\circ) = 208^\circ
  \]

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m \angle 3\), which corresponds to the angle at vertex \(C\).
- We have already determined that the angle at vertex \(C\) is \(208^\circ\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, the angles at each vertex, and the calculation of the remaining angle.
