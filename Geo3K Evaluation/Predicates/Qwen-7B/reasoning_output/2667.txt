STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2667
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle D A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- Angles at point \(F\) are labeled as \(49^\circ\) and \(59^\circ\).
- Segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) are marked with lengths \(3y - 8\) and \(10\) respectively.
- Segments \(AD\) and \(BC\) are marked with lengths \(13\) and \(2x + 7\) respectively.
- There are no right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks visible in the diagram.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal (\(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\)).
- Given \(CD = 10\) and \(AD = 13\), we have \(AB = 10\) and \(BC = 13\).
- The sum of adjacent angles in a parallelogram is \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle A + \angle C = 180^\circ\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(AB = 10\)
- \(CD = 10\)
- \(AD = 13\)
- \(BC = 13\)
- \(3y - 8 = 10 \Rightarrow y = 6\)
- \(2x + 7 = 13 \Rightarrow x = 3\)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(\angle DAB\).
- Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle CDA\) are supplementary angles with respect to \(\angle DAB\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the relationships between them.
- Must include the given lengths and the fact that opposite sides are equal.
