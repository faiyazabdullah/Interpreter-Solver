STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2808
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that B E and A D are perpendicular.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a straight line segment AI extended through point F to point D, forming two angles at F.
- Angle AFN measures \(6x^\circ\) and angle BFC measures \(3x^\circ\).
- Line segment AF is perpendicular to line segment FD, implying angle AFN is a right angle.
- The question asks us to find x such that BE and AD are perpendicular.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points F, B, and E form a right angle, making BE perpendicular to AD if BE and AD intersect at a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle AFN = \(6x^\circ\)
- Angle BFC = \(3x^\circ\)
- The sum of angles at point F forms a full straight angle, thus:
  \[
  6x + 3x = 180^\circ
  \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[
  9x = 180^\circ \implies x = 20^\circ
  \]

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to ensure that BE and AD are perpendicular.
- From the relationship derived, \(x = 20^\circ\).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The key predicate here is to ensure the angles sum up correctly and that the lines are perpendicular.
