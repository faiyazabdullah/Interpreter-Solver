STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2926
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the trapezoid.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 10 cm.
- Side CD is marked as 14 cm.
- Side AD is marked as 15 cm.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex D.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid ABCD with right angle at D.
- AD and BC are perpendicular to AB and CD respectively.
- AB and CD are the legs of the trapezoid.
- AD and BC are the non-parallel sides of the trapezoid.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 10 cm (given)
- CD = 14 cm (given)
- AD = 15 cm (given)

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the trapezoid.
- The formula for the area of a trapezoid is \(\frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h\), where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the bases and \(h\) is the height.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
