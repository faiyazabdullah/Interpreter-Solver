STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2998
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- Side \( AB \) is marked as 14 units.
- Side \( AC \) is marked as \( x \) units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \).
- The angle \( \angle ACB \) is labeled as \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with a right angle at vertex \( B \).
- Side \( AB \) is the base of the right triangle.
- Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- The angle \( \angle ACB \) is \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of side \( AB \) is 14 units.
- The length of side \( AC \) is \( x \) units.
- The length of side \( BC \) can be found using trigonometric relationships.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of side \( AC \).
- Since \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \) and \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( B \) as the right angle, we can use trigonometric relationships involving cosine.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include all visible geometric constraints and properties.
