================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center \(A\).
- There are two intersecting chords \(XY\) and \(WZ\).
- Chord \(XY\) is divided into segments \(XW\) and \(YW\) where \(XW = 12\) and \(YW = 6\).
- Chord \(WZ\) intersects \(XY\) at point \(W\).
- \(W\) divides \(XY\) such that \(XY = XW + WY = 12 + 6 = 18\).

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The chords intersect inside the circle.
- By the Intersecting Chords Theorem, the product of the lengths of the two segments created by one chord equals the product of the lengths of the two segments created by the other chord.
- Therefore, \(XW \cdot YW = ZW \cdot WX\).

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \(XW = 12\)
- \(YW = 6\)
- \(XY = 18\)
- We need to find the length of \(WZ\).

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \(WZ\).

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, the intersection of the chords, and the given lengths.
- The Intersecting Chords Theorem will be used to find the unknown length \(WZ\).
