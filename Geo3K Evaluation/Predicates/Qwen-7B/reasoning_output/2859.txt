STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2859
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram ABCD.
- Side AD is labeled as 12 meters.
- Side CD is labeled as 10 meters.
- Angle DAB is labeled as 60 degrees.
- There is a dashed line from point B to point D, forming a right angle with AB.

### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram.
- Line AD is parallel to line BC.
- Line AB is parallel to line CD.
- Line BD forms a right angle with line AB.
- Angle DAB is 60 degrees.

### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 12 meters
- CD = 10 meters
- Angle DAB = 60 degrees
- BD is the diagonal and is perpendicular to AB.

### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram.
- To find the perimeter, we need the lengths of all sides of the parallelogram.

### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the relationship between the sides and the diagonal.
