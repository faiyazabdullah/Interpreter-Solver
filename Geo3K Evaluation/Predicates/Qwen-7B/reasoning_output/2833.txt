STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2833
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \triangle C D F, K is the centroid and D K = 16. Find C D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle \( \triangle CDF \).
- Point \( K \) is the centroid of \( \triangle CDF \).
- \( DK = 16 \).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( K \) is the centroid of \( \triangle CDF \).
- Centroids divide medians into a ratio of 2:1.
- Since \( DK = 16 \), it represents the longer segment of the median from \( C \) to \( DF \).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \( DK = 16 \).

STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- We need to find the length of \( CD \).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We will represent the triangle, centroid, and the measurement of the median.
