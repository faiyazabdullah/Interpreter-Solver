REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is centered at point \( X \).
  - Four points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) are drawn inside the circle.
  - Additional points \( M, N, Y, Z \) are marked along the chords and arcs, possibly indicating midpoints or intersections.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - Chord \( AB = 30 \).
  - Chord \( CD = 30 \).
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{CZ} \) is given as \( 40^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angles are marked at points \( A, C, D, Z \), indicating that certain lines might be perpendicular to others or that specific angles are \( 90^\circ \).
  - No other explicit parallel or congruence markings are visible.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Circle Properties:**
  - Both \( AB \) and \( CD \) are chords of the circle.
  - Since \( AB = CD = 30 \), the chords are congruent.
  - Congruent chords subtend equal arcs on the circle.

- **Arc Relationships:**
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is the sum of the measures of its sub-arcs, such as \( \widehat{CZ} \) and \( \widehat{ZD} \).
  - Since \( \widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \), we need to determine the remaining part of \( \widehat{CD} \).

- **Symmetry and Midpoints:**
  - Points \( M \) and \( N \) appear to be midpoints of chords \( AB \) and \( CD \), respectively.
  - This symmetry suggests that the circle may have rotational or reflective symmetry about the chords.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 30 \).
  - \( CD = 30 \).
  - \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \).

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are congruent chords, they subtend equal central angles.
  - The measure of \( \widehat{CD} \) can be determined by analyzing the given arc \( \widehat{CZ} \) and the symmetry of the circle.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What is Asked:**
  - We need to find the measure of arc \( \widehat{CD} \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - Congruent chords subtend equal arcs.
  - The measure of an entire arc depends on the central angle it subtends.
  - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates for Shapes and Points:**
  - Define the circle, its center, and the points on the circumference.
  - Indicate the chords and their lengths.
  - Specify the arc measures and their relationships.

- **Predicates for Measurements:**
  - Use `Equals` to specify the lengths of chords \( AB \) and \( CD \).
  - Use `MeasureOf` to specify the arc \( \widehat{CZ} \).

- **Predicates for Relationships:**
  - Use `Congruent` to indicate that \( AB \) and \( CD \) are congruent chords.
  - Use `Sub` to express the relationship between the arcs \( \widehat{CD} \) and \( \widehat{CZ} \).
