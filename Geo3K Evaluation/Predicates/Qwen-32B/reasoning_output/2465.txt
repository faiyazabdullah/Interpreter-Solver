REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image depicts a triangle \( \triangle PQR \).
  - There are three perpendicular bisectors \( l \), \( m \), and \( n \) that intersect at a common point \( T \).
  - Key points are labeled: \( P, Q, R, T \), and several intermediate points like \( G, H, I, J \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( l, m, n \) are labeled as perpendicular bisectors.
  - Segments are labeled with numerical expressions:
    - \( PT = 3y - 1 \)
    - \( TR = 8 \)
    - \( TQ = 2x \)
    - \( PR = z + 4 \)
    - \( QR = 7 \)
    - \( PQ = 2x \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - The perpendicular bisectors imply that \( T \) is the circumcenter of \( \triangle PQR \).
  - The segments \( PT, TQ, \) and \( TR \) are radii of the circumcircle, so they are equal in length.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( l, m, n \) are perpendicular bisectors of \( \triangle PQR \), meeting at the circumcenter \( T \).
  - Since \( T \) is the circumcenter, \( T \) is equidistant from all vertices \( P, Q, \) and \( R \). Therefore:
    \[
    PT = TQ = TR
    \]
  - The segments \( PT, TQ, \) and \( TR \) are radii of the circumcircle of \( \triangle PQR \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - \( TR = 8 \) is explicitly given.
  - \( TQ = 2x \) and \( PT = 3y - 1 \) are expressed in terms of variables.
  - The lengths \( PR = z + 4 \) and \( QR = 7 \) are sides of \( \triangle PQR \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values and Expressions:**
  - \( TR = 8 \)
  - \( TQ = 2x \)
  - \( PT = 3y - 1 \)
  - \( PR = z + 4 \)
  - \( QR = 7 \)

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( T \) is the circumcenter, the distances \( PT, TQ, \) and \( TR \) are equal:
    \[
    PT = TQ = TR = 8
    \]
  - This implies:
    \[
    2x = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad 3y - 1 = 8
    \]

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks us to find the value of \( z \).
- To find \( z \), we need to use the relationship between the sides of \( \triangle PQR \) and the given information about the circumcenter \( T \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key predicates will capture:
  1. The fact that \( T \) is the circumcenter and equidistant from \( P, Q, \) and \( R \).
  2. The given measurements and their relationships.
  3. The equality of the circumradius in terms of \( PT, TQ, \) and \( TR \).
