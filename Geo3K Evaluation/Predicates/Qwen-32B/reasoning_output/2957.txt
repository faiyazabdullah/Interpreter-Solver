REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There are two right triangles: \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are labeled.
  
- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \( AD = 10 \) (hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABD \)).
  - \( BD = 8 \) (one leg of \( \triangle ABD \)).
  - The vertical distance from \( D \) to \( B \) is 18 units (total height of the larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \)).
  - The vertical distance from \( D \) to \( A \) is 8 units.
  - Therefore, the vertical distance from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( 18 - 8 = 10 \) units.
  
- **Special Markings**:
  - There are right angle symbols at \( \angle ADB \) and \( \angle ABC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements**:
  - \( \triangle ABD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( AB \) is a common segment in both triangles.
  - \( AD \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABD \).
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( AD = 10 \) (hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABD \)).
  - \( BD = 8 \) (one leg of \( \triangle ABD \)).
  - Vertical distance \( DB = 8 \) and \( AB = 10 \) (from the difference in heights).
  - Total height \( DC = 18 \).
  - We need to find the length of \( AC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of \( AC \).
- To find \( AC \), we use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \):
  - \( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \).
  - We already know \( AB = 10 \). We need to find \( BC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the geometric shapes, lines, angles, and relationships.
- Include all visible measurements and constraints.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides of the triangles.
