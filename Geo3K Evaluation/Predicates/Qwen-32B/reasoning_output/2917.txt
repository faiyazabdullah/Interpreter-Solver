REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram contains a right triangle \( \triangle RQT \).
  - Points \( R \), \( Q \), and \( T \) are vertices of the triangle.
  - Points \( S \) and \( A \) are additional points.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( RS \) and \( ST \) are segments forming the base \( RT \).
  - \( RQ \) and \( QT \) are legs of the right triangle.
  - \( QS \) is a perpendicular segment from \( Q \) to \( RT \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( RS = 7 \) and \( ST = 7 \), so the total length of \( RT = RS + ST = 14 \).
  - \( RQ = x + 3 \).
  - \( QT = 2x - 6 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( \angle RQS \) and \( \angle TQS \) are right angles, indicated by the right-angle symbols.
  - \( QS \) is perpendicular to \( RT \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle RQT \) is a right triangle with \( \angle RQT = 90^\circ \).
  - \( QS \) is the altitude from \( Q \) to the hypotenuse \( RT \).
  - \( RS = ST = 7 \), so \( S \) is the midpoint of \( RT \).
  - \( RQ \) and \( QT \) are the legs of the right triangle.
  - The lengths of \( RQ \) and \( QT \) are expressed in terms of \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( RS = 7 \) and \( ST = 7 \), so \( RT = 14 \).
  - \( RQ = x + 3 \).
  - \( QT = 2x - 6 \).

- **Relationships**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to \( \triangle RQT \):
    \[
    RQ^2 + QT^2 = RT^2
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    (x + 3)^2 + (2x - 6)^2 = 14^2
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( TQ \).
- From the diagram, \( TQ \) is one of the legs of the right triangle \( \triangle RQT \).
- The length of \( TQ \) is given as \( 2x - 6 \). To find \( TQ \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the structure of the triangle, the right angles, the lengths of the sides, and the relationships between them.
