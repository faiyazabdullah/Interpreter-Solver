REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - A square \( \text{ABCD} \) is drawn.
  - A circle is inscribed within the square, with its center at point \( H \).
  - The square is circumscribed around the circle, meaning the circle touches the square at the midpoints of its sides.

- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points \( A, B, C, D \) are the vertices of the square.
  - Points \( E, F, G, I, M \) are marked where the circle touches the sides of the square.
  - Line segments connecting these points form the square and the tangents to the circle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols indicate that the square has four right angles.
  - The circle is tangent to the square at points \( E, F, G, I, M \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The side length of the square is given as 14 yards.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The square \( \text{ABCD} \) is circumscribed around the circle, meaning the circle is inscribed within the square.
  - The circle is tangent to each side of the square at its midpoint.
  - The diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.
  - The center of the circle \( H \) is also the center of the square.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The side length of the square \( \text{ABCD} \) is 14 yards.
  - Since the circle is inscribed in the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square.
  - Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 14 yards.
  - The radius of the circle is half the diameter, i.e., \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) yards.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the exact circumference of the circle.
- To find the circumference, we use the formula for the circumference of a circle:
  \[
  \text{Circumference} = 2\pi \times \text{radius}
  \]
- From the analysis, the radius of the circle is 7 yards. Thus, the circumference can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Circumference} = 2\pi \times 7 = 14\pi \text{ yards}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the form of predicates.
- The predicates should capture the square, the circle, the tangency relationships, and the measurements without directly stating the final answer.
