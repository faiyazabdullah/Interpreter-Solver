================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle M P Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a triangle \( \triangle MPN \).
  - Points labeled: \( M \), \( P \), \( N \), and an additional point \( Q \) outside the triangle.
  
- **Lines:**
  - Lines \( MP \), \( PN \), and \( MN \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - Line \( PQ \) extends from point \( P \) to point \( Q \), lying outside the triangle.

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle MPN = 56^\circ \).
  - \( \angle PNM = 45^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No special markings indicating parallelism, perpendicularity, or congruence are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Properties:**
  - \( \triangle MPN \) is a triangle with vertices \( M \), \( P \), and \( N \).
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

- **Relationships:**
  - Point \( Q \) lies on the extension of line \( PN \) beyond point \( P \).
  - \( \angle MPQ \) is an exterior angle formed by extending the side \( PN \) of the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \angle MPN = 56^\circ \).
  - \( \angle PNM = 45^\circ \).

- **Derived Information:**
  - To find \( \angle MPQ \), we need to use the property that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle MPQ \).
- To solve this, we need to use the exterior angle theorem, which states that the measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, its angles, and the relationship between the interior and exterior angles.
- Predicates will include the triangle, its angles, and the relationship that \( \angle MPQ \) is the exterior angle.
