REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - The image contains a large semicircle and three smaller semicircles nested within it.
  - The large semicircle has a diameter labeled as 15 units.
  - The smaller semicircles are tangent to the larger semicircle and to each other along the horizontal line.
  - The centers of the smaller semicircles lie on the horizontal line.

- **Points and Labels:**
  - Points \( A, F, C, G, E \) are labeled on the horizontal line.
  - Point \( A \) is the leftmost endpoint of the large semicircle's diameter.
  - Point \( E \) is the rightmost endpoint of the large semicircle's diameter.
  - Points \( F, C, G \) divide the diameter into segments corresponding to the diameters of the smaller semicircles.

- **Measurements:**
  - The total diameter of the large semicircle is 15 units.

- **Shaded Region:**
  - The shaded region is the area of the large semicircle minus the combined areas of the three smaller semicircles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements:**
  - The three smaller semicircles are tangent to the large semicircle and to each other.
  - The sum of the diameters of the three smaller semicircles equals the diameter of the large semicircle.
  - The centers of the smaller semicircles lie on the same horizontal line as the diameter of the large semicircle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - Diameter of the large semicircle: 15 units.
  - Let the diameters of the three smaller semicircles be \( d_1, d_2, d_3 \). Then:
    \[
    d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 15
    \]

- **Key Calculations:**
  - The radius of the large semicircle is:
    \[
    R = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5
    \]
  - The areas of the semicircles are proportional to the squares of their radii.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Find the area of the shaded region.
  - The shaded region is the area of the large semicircle minus the combined areas of the three smaller semicircles.
  - The formula for the area of a semicircle is:
    \[
    \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
    \]
  - We need to calculate the area of the large semicircle and subtract the areas of the three smaller semicircles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the semicircles and their radii.
  - Express the relationship between the diameters of the semicircles.
  - Calculate the areas using the formula for the area of a semicircle.
  - Represent the shaded region as the difference between the area of the large semicircle and the combined areas of the smaller semicircles.
