================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is shown.
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \) are marked on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines are drawn from external points to the circle, suggesting tangents.

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations:**
  - The segment from point \( D \) to the point of tangency is labeled as 5 units.
  - The segment from point \( E \) to the point of tangency is labeled as 4 units.
  - The segment from point \( C \) to the point of tangency is labeled as \( x + 8 \) units.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The lines from \( D \) and \( E \) to the circle are tangent lines, indicated by the right-angle symbols at the points of tangency.
  - The line from \( C \) to the circle is also tangent, as suggested by the context.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The lines from points \( D \), \( E \), and \( C \) to the circle are tangent lines.
  - Tangent segments drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length.
    - Therefore, the tangent segments from \( D \) to the circle are equal.
    - Similarly, the tangent segments from \( E \) to the circle are equal.
    - The tangent segments from \( C \) to the circle are equal.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The lengths of the tangent segments from a common external point to a circle are equal.
  - This property will help us set up equations to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Tangent segment from \( D \): 5 units.
  - Tangent segment from \( E \): 4 units.
  - Tangent segment from \( C \): \( x + 8 \) units.

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - Since tangent segments from a common external point are equal, we can use this property to set up equations.
  - The lengths of the tangent segments from \( D \), \( E \), and \( C \) must satisfy the equality conditions based on their respective points of tangency.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the value of \( x \).
  - The problem involves using the property of tangent segments being equal in length.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - Tangent segments drawn from a common external point to a circle are equal.
  - This property will allow us to set up an equation involving \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle and its tangents.
  - Indicate that the tangent segments from a common external point are equal.
  - Capture the given measurements and their relationships.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are represented.
