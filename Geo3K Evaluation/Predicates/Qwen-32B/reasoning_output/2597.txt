REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle centered at point \( U \).
  - An equilateral pentagon \( PQRST \) is inscribed in the circle.
  - The vertices \( P, Q, R, S, T \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The center of the circle is labeled as \( U \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - The pentagon is labeled as equilateral, meaning all its sides are equal.
  - The circle is labeled as \( \odot U \), indicating it is centered at \( U \).
  - No specific numerical measurements are provided for lengths or angles.

- **Special Markings:**
  - None (no right angles, parallel lines, or congruence markings are explicitly shown).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The pentagon \( PQRST \) is equilateral, so all its sides are congruent: \( PQ = QR = RS = ST = TP \).
  - The pentagon is inscribed in the circle, meaning all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The circle is the circumcircle of the pentagon.
  - Since the pentagon is equilateral and inscribed in a circle, it is also regular (all interior angles are equal, and all central angles subtended by the sides are equal).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - In a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle, each central angle subtended by a side of the pentagon is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{QR} \) is part of the circle and subtends the central angle \( \angle QUR \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - No explicit numerical measurements are provided for lengths or angles.
  - However, we can infer that the central angle subtended by any side of the pentagon is \( 72^\circ \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The measure of the arc \( \widehat{QR} \) is equal to the measure of the central angle \( \angle QUR \), which is \( 72^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Question Asked:**
  - Find \( m\widehat{QR} \), the measure of the arc \( \widehat{QR} \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - In a circle, the measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.
  - Since \( PQRST \) is a regular pentagon, the central angle subtended by each side is \( 72^\circ \).

- **Information Needed:**
  - The fact that the pentagon is equilateral and inscribed in the circle allows us to determine that the central angle \( \angle QUR \) is \( 72^\circ \).
  - Therefore, \( m\widehat{QR} = 72^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the pentagon, the circle, the inscribed relationship, and the central angle.
  - Capture the property that the pentagon is equilateral and regular.
  - Indicate the relationship between the arc \( \widehat{QR} \) and the central angle \( \angle QUR \).

- **Completeness Check:**
  - All visible information is captured, including the equilateral nature of the pentagon, its inscription in the circle, and the relationship between the arc and the central angle.
