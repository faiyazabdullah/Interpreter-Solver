================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a circle centered at point \( Z \).
  - Points \( W, X, Y, U, V \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( WU \) and \( VY \) are diameters of the circle.
  - Angles \( \angle WZX \) and \( \angle XZY \) are formed at the center \( Z \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( m\angle VZU = 4x \).
  - \( m\angle UZY = 2x + 24 \).
  - \( WU \) and \( VY \) are explicitly stated as diameters.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence symbols are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since \( WU \) and \( VY \) are diameters, they pass through the center \( Z \) and divide the circle into two semicircles.
  - \( \angle WZX \cong \angle XZY \): These central angles are congruent, implying that the arcs \( WX \) and \( XY \) are also congruent.
  - The sum of the central angles around the center \( Z \) is \( 360^\circ \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The total measure of the central angles around the center \( Z \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{WUX} \) is part of the circle and can be determined using the given angle measures.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Relationships:**
  - \( m\angle VZU = 4x \).
  - \( m\angle UZY = 2x + 24 \).
  - Since \( WU \) and \( VY \) are diameters, the remaining central angles can be expressed in terms of \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - Find \( m\widehat{WUX} \), the measure of the arc \( \widehat{WUX} \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its corresponding central angle.
  - Since \( WU \) is a diameter, \( \angle WZU = 180^\circ \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{WUX} \) corresponds to the central angle \( \angle WZX \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify that \( WU \) and \( VY \) are diameters.
  - Relate the given angle measures to the central angles.
  - Use the fact that the sum of central angles around the center is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Represent the congruence of angles \( \angle WZX \) and \( \angle XZY \).
