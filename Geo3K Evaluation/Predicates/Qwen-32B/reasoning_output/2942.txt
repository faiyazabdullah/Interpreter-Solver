### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The sides of the triangle are labeled:
    - \( AB = 9 \)
    - \( AC = 9 \)
  - The angle at vertex \( A \) is marked as \( 60^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings such as right angles or parallel lines are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has two sides of equal length (\( AB = AC = 9 \)).
  - The angle at vertex \( A \) is given as \( 60^\circ \).
  - Since two sides are equal and one angle is \( 60^\circ \), the triangle is an **equilateral triangle**. This is because in an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are \( 60^\circ \).

- **Implied Properties**:
  - In an equilateral triangle, all three sides are equal.
  - All internal angles are \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 9 \)
  - \( AC = 9 \)
  - \( \angle A = 60^\circ \)

- **Implications**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, the third side \( BC \) must also be equal to \( 9 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BC \).
- From the analysis, we know that \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, so all sides are equal.
- Therefore, \( BC = AB = AC = 9 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements without explicitly stating the final answer.
- Predicates should capture the fact that \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral, the side lengths, and the angle at vertex \( A \).
