================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - There is a circle with center \( O \).
  - Two tangent segments \( XC \) and \( XE \) are drawn from an external point \( X \) to the circle.
  - Segments \( AD \) and \( AE \) intersect the circle at points \( D \) and \( E \), respectively.
  - Points \( A \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), and \( X \) are labeled.
  - The lengths of segments \( XC \) and \( XD \) are given as 6 and 9, respectively.

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( XC = 6 \)
  - \( XD = 9 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - The segments \( XC \) and \( XE \) are tangent to the circle, as indicated by the right-angle symbols at points \( C \) and \( E \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since \( XC \) and \( XE \) are tangent segments from the same external point \( X \) to the circle, they are congruent by the Tangent Segment Theorem.
    - Therefore, \( XC = XE \).
  - The segment \( XD \) is part of the secant line \( XA \), and \( XE \) is also part of the secant line \( XA \).
  - The Power of a Point theorem applies here, as \( X \) is outside the circle, and the secant intersects the circle at two points (\( D \) and \( E \)).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( XC = 6 \)
  - \( XD = 9 \)
  - Since \( XC \) and \( XE \) are tangent segments, \( XE = XC = 6 \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \), which represents the length of \( DE \).
- To solve this, we use the Power of a Point theorem, which states:
  \[
  XC^2 = XD \cdot XA
  \]
  Here, \( XA = XD + DA \), and we need to determine \( DA \) to find \( DE \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using atomic predicates.
- The key relationships involve tangents, secants, and the Power of a Point theorem.
- Ensure that all relevant geometric properties and measurements are captured.
