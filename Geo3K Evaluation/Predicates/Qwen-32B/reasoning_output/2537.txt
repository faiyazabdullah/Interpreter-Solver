REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle with center \( F \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( A \) and \( C \) are endpoints of a diameter \( AC \).
  - \( B \) and \( D \) are other points on the circle.
  - \( F \) is the center of the circle.

- **Lines and Chords**:
  - \( AC \) is the diameter of the circle.
  - \( AB, BC, CD, DA \) are chords of the circle.

- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle BFD = 72^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AFD = (4a - 1)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AFB = (2a - 5)^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The angle measures are expressed in terms of the variable \( a \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties**:
  - Since \( AC \) is the diameter, \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle ADC \) are right angles (by the inscribed angle theorem).
  - The center \( F \) is equidistant from all points on the circumference.

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - \( \angle BFD \) and \( \angle AFD \) are central angles.
  - \( \angle AFB \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AB \).

- **Symmetry and Constraints**:
  - The circle's symmetry implies that the relationships between the angles and the arcs are consistent with the circle's properties.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle BFD = 72^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AFD = (4a - 1)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AFB = (2a - 5)^\circ \).

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - The sum of the angles around point \( F \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The inscribed angle \( \angle AFB \) is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle AFB \).
- To find \( \angle AFB \), we need to determine the value of \( a \) using the given angle relationships and the properties of the circle.
- The key relationships involve the central angles \( \angle BFD \) and \( \angle AFD \), and the inscribed angle \( \angle AFB \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all geometric shapes, points, lines, and angles.
- Capture the relationships between the angles and the circle's properties.
- Ensure all given measurements and constraints are included as atomic predicates.
