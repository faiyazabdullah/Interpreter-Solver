REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - A right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is depicted.
  - The right angle is marked at vertex \( C \).
  
- **Points**:
  - The vertices of the triangle are labeled as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

- **Lines**:
  - \( \overline{AB} \): One side of the triangle.
  - \( \overline{BC} \): Another side of the triangle.
  - \( \overline{AC} \): The hypotenuse of the triangle.

- **Measurements**:
  - \( \overline{AB} = 5 \) ft.
  - \( \overline{BC} = 12 \) ft.

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol is drawn at \( \angle ACB \), indicating that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).
  - \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{BC} \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( \overline{AC} \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The sides \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{BC} \) are perpendicular to each other.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \text{Length of } \overline{AB} = 5 \) ft.
  - \( \text{Length of } \overline{BC} = 12 \) ft.
  
- **Unknown Measurement**:
  - The length of the hypotenuse \( \overline{AC} \) is to be determined using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of the hypotenuse \( \overline{AC} \) of the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- To solve this, we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states:
  \[
  (\text{Hypotenuse})^2 = (\text{Leg}_1)^2 + (\text{Leg}_2)^2
  \]
  Here, \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{BC} \) are the legs, and \( \overline{AC} \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram using the provided predicate format.
- Predicates will include the triangle, its sides, the right angle, the lengths of the sides, and the relationship between them based on the Pythagorean theorem.
