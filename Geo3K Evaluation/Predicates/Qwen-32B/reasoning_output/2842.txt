REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - There is a point \(F\) inside the quadrilateral where diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - The sides of the quadrilateral are labeled with specific expressions or lengths:
    - \(AD = 13\)
    - \(DC = 10\)
    - \(BC = 2x + 7\)
    - \(AB = 3y - 8\)
    
- **Angles**:
  - \(\angle DAB = 59^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ABC = 20^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BFC = 49^\circ\) (at the intersection of diagonals).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No explicit right angles, parallel lines, or congruence marks are shown.
  - However, the problem specifies that \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Diagonals bisect each other.

- **Given Information**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, we can use the properties of parallelograms to establish relationships between sides and angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \(AD = 13\)
  - \(DC = 10\)
  - \(BC = 2x + 7\)
  - \(AB = 3y - 8\)

- **Expressions for Sides**:
  - From the parallelogram property \(AB = DC\), we have \(3y - 8 = 10\).
  - From the parallelogram property \(AD = BC\), we have \(13 = 2x + 7\).

- **Angles**:
  - \(\angle DAB = 59^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ABC = 20^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BFC = 49^\circ\) (not directly used for solving \(m \angle DAC\)).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle DAC\).
- To find \(m \angle DAC\), we need to use the properties of the parallelogram and the given angles.
- In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle ADC\) are supplementary:
  \[
  \angle DAB + \angle ADC = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle ADC = 180^\circ - 59^\circ = 121^\circ
  \]
- Since \(AC\) is a diagonal, it divides \(\angle ADC\) into two angles: \(\angle DAC\) and \(\angle DCA\). However, without additional information about the symmetry or specific division, we cannot determine \(\angle DAC\) precisely from the given data alone. The problem likely assumes basic properties or additional unstated assumptions.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided guidelines.
- Predicates will capture the shape, sides, angles, and relationships without directly solving for the final answer.
