REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle centered at point \( Z \).
  - There are points \( W \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) labeled.
  - Lines \( WX \) and \( XY \) are shown extending from the circle.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - Line \( WX \) is labeled with the expression \( 2x + 9 \).
  - Line \( XY \) is labeled with the expression \( 3x + 6 \).
  - The segment \( WX \) is tangent to the circle at point \( X \).
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruent segments are visible.
  
#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The segment \( WX \) is tangent to the circle at point \( X \). This implies that the radius \( ZX \) is perpendicular to \( WX \) at \( X \).
  - The segment \( XY \) is a secant line that intersects the circle at two points, one of which is \( X \).
  - The lengths of the tangent segment \( WX \) and the external part of the secant segment \( XY \) are related by the Power of a Point theorem.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Expressions:**
  - The length of the tangent segment \( WX \) is given as \( 2x + 9 \).
  - The length of the external part of the secant segment \( XY \) is given as \( 3x + 6 \).
  - These expressions represent the lengths of the segments in terms of the variable \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The problem states that the segment \( WX \) is tangent to the circle.
  - We need to find the value of \( x \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The Power of a Point theorem applies here. For a point outside a circle, if a tangent segment and a secant segment are drawn, the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the whole secant segment and its external part.
  - Mathematically, if \( WX \) is the tangent and \( XY \) is the external part of the secant, then:
    \[
    WX^2 = XY \cdot (XY + \text{internal part of secant})
    \]
    However, since the internal part of the secant is not given, we use the simplified form for a tangent and a secant intersecting at the same external point:
    \[
    WX^2 = XY \cdot (XY + \text{internal part of secant}) = XY \cdot (XY + 0) = XY^2
    \]
    But in this case, we directly use:
    \[
    WX^2 = XY \cdot (XY + \text{internal part of secant})
    \]
    Since the internal part is not given, we assume the simplified form:
    \[
    WX^2 = XY \cdot XY
    \]
    This simplifies to:
    \[
    WX^2 = XY \cdot (XY + \text{internal part of secant})
    \]
    But in this case, we directly use:
    \[
    WX^2 = XY \cdot (XY + \text{internal part of secant})
    \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, points, and lines.
  - Capture the tangency condition and the lengths of the segments.
  - Use the Power of a Point theorem to relate the lengths.
