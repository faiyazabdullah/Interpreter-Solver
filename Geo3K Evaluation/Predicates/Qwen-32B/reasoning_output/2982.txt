REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two lines \( a \) and \( b \) are intersected by a transversal line.
  - Points labeled: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L \).
  - Angles are numbered from 1 to 8.

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations:**
  - \( m\angle 4 = 42^\circ \) is explicitly given.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Lines \( a \) and \( b \) appear to be parallel (implied by the consistent angle markings).
  - No right angle symbols are present.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Parallel Lines:**
  - Lines \( a \) and \( b \) are parallel because corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles are consistent with parallel lines cut by a transversal.

- **Transversal Properties:**
  - The transversal intersects lines \( a \) and \( b \) at points \( D \) and \( E \), respectively.
  - Angles formed by the transversal and parallel lines have specific relationships:
    - Corresponding angles are equal.
    - Alternate interior angles are equal.
    - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurement:**
  - \( m\angle 4 = 42^\circ \).

- **Inferred Relationships:**
  - Since \( a \parallel b \), we can use the properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal to find other angles.
  - Specifically, \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for \( m\angle 7 \).
- To solve this, we need to use the property that consecutive interior angles are supplementary when lines are parallel.
- Therefore, \( m\angle 4 + m\angle 7 = 180^\circ \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- Represent the parallel lines and the transversal.
- Define the angles and their relationships.
- Capture the given measurement and the supplementary relationship between \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 7 \).
