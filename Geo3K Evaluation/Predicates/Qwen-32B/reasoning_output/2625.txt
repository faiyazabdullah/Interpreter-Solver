REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a quadrilateral \( D E F G \).
  - There are additional points labeled \( A \) and \( C \) inside the quadrilateral.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Lines connecting the vertices form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  - Diagonals \( D F \) and \( E G \) intersect at point \( A \).
  - Right-angle symbols are present at \( \angle D G F \) and \( \angle E F G \), indicating that \( D G \) and \( E F \) are perpendicular to \( G F \) and \( E G \), respectively.
  
- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - The measure of \( \angle E F D \) is given as \( 2x - 3 \).
  - The measure of \( \angle D F G \) is given as \( x + 12 \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties:**
  - Since \( D E F G \) is a rectangle, the following properties hold:
    - Opposite sides are equal: \( D E = G F \) and \( D G = E F \).
    - All interior angles are right angles: \( \angle D G F = \angle E F G = \angle D E F = \angle G F E = 90^\circ \).
    - Diagonals are equal: \( D F = E G \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - \( \angle E F D \) and \( \angle D F G \) are adjacent angles along the diagonal \( D F \).
  - Since \( D E F G \) is a rectangle, \( \angle D F G \) and \( \angle E F D \) are part of the larger right triangles formed by the diagonals and sides of the rectangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( m \angle E F D = 2x - 3 \)
  - \( m \angle D F G = x + 12 \)
  
- **Properties of Rectangles:**
  - In a rectangle, the sum of the angles around any point is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Specifically, since \( D F \) is a diagonal, the angles \( \angle E F D \) and \( \angle D F G \) are supplementary because they form a straight line along \( D F \):
    \[
    m \angle E F D + m \angle D F G = 180^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks us to find the measure of \( \angle E F D \).
- Using the given expressions for the angles:
  \[
  m \angle E F D = 2x - 3
  \]
  \[
  m \angle D F G = x + 12
  \]
- The key relationship is that these two angles are supplementary:
  \[
  (2x - 3) + (x + 12) = 180
  \]
- Solving this equation will give the value of \( x \), and subsequently, the measure of \( \angle E F D \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the structure of the rectangle, the right angles, the diagonals, and the given angle measures.
