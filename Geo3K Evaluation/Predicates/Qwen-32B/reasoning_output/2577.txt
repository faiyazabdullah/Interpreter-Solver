================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two triangles are visible: \( \triangle RPS \) and \( \triangle UVW \).
  - Points: \( R, P, S, T, U, Q, V, W \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines: \( RS, ST, TP, PR, UV, VW, WU, QU \).
  - Segments: \( RS = 13.5 \), \( UV = 3 \).

- **Angles:**
  - Markings indicate congruent angles at corresponding vertices:
    - \( \angle R \cong \angle U \) (both marked with a single arc).
    - \( \angle P \cong \angle Q \) (both marked with a double arc).
    - \( \angle S \cong \angle V \) (both marked with a triple arc).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The triangles appear to be similar due to the congruent angle markings.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similar Triangles:**
  - The triangles \( \triangle RPS \) and \( \triangle UVW \) are similar by the AAA (Angle-Angle-Angle) similarity criterion because all corresponding angles are congruent.
  - This implies proportional corresponding sides: \( \frac{RS}{UV} = \frac{RP}{UQ} = \frac{PS}{VW} \).

- **Proportional Sides:**
  - Given \( RS = 13.5 \) and \( UV = 3 \), the scale factor between the triangles is \( \frac{RS}{UV} = \frac{13.5}{3} = 4.5 \).

- **Corresponding Sides:**
  - \( RP \) corresponds to \( UQ \), and since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their lengths is also 4.5.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( RS = 13.5 \).
  - \( UV = 3 \).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \( \triangle RPS \sim \triangle UVW \), the scale factor is 4.5.
  - If \( UQ = x \), then \( RP = 4.5x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find \( x \), which represents the length of segment \( UQ \).
- Using the similarity of triangles, we know the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Specifically, \( \frac{RP}{UQ} = 4.5 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships, including similarity, congruent angles, and proportional sides.
- The predicates should capture the similarity of triangles, the congruent angles, and the proportional relationships between corresponding sides.
