REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure shows a quadrilateral \( FGHJ \).
  - The vertices are labeled as \( F, G, H, J \).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Lines \( FG, GH, HJ, JF \) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  - Angles are marked at vertices:
    - \( \angle GFH = 128^\circ \) (at vertex \( F \)).
    - \( \angle FJH = 72^\circ \) (at vertex \( J \)).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Two pairs of adjacent sides are marked as congruent, indicating that \( FG \cong JH \) and \( FH \cong GJ \). This confirms that \( FGHJ \) is a kite.
  - Diagonals \( FH \) and \( GJ \) intersect at right angles (marked with a right-angle symbol at the intersection point).

- **Measurements**:
  - The measure of \( \angle GFH \) is explicitly given as \( 128^\circ \).
  - The measure of \( \angle FJH \) is explicitly given as \( 72^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Kite Properties**:
  - A kite has two pairs of adjacent congruent sides: \( FG \cong JH \) and \( FH \cong GJ \).
  - The diagonals of a kite intersect at right angles.
  - One diagonal (the axis of symmetry) bisects the angles at its endpoints.

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - Since \( FGHJ \) is a kite, the diagonal \( GJ \) is the axis of symmetry. Therefore, \( \angle GFJ \) and \( \angle HFJ \) are equal because they are formed by the axis of symmetry.
  - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle GFH = 128^\circ \).
  - \( \angle FJH = 72^\circ \).

- **Implications**:
  - The diagonal \( GJ \) bisects \( \angle GFH \) and \( \angle FJH \) because it is the axis of symmetry.
  - Therefore, \( \angle GFJ = \angle HFJ \) and \( \angle GJF = \angle HJF \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle GFJ \).
- To find \( \angle GFJ \), we use the property that the diagonal \( GJ \) bisects \( \angle GFH \). Since \( \angle GFH = 128^\circ \), \( \angle GFJ \) is half of \( \angle GFH \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the kite and its properties.
- Include the given angle measures.
- Capture the bisection property of the diagonal.
- Ensure all relationships and measurements are represented.
