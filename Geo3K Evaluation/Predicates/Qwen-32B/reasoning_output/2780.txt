REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is shown with center \( O \).
  - Four points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines are drawn connecting these points, forming segments \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), and \( DA \).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Line \( AB \) is a chord of the circle.
  - Line \( BC \) is a chord of the circle.
  - Line \( CD \) is a chord of the circle.
  - Line \( DA \) is a chord of the circle.
  - An angle \( \angle 9 \) is formed at point \( B \) by the chords \( AB \) and \( BC \).

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - The measure of \( \angle AOB \) is given as \( 120^\circ \).
  - The angle \( \angle 9 \) is labeled as \( \angle ABC \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruent segments are indicated.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
  - The points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the same circle, forming a cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCD \).

- **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle:**
  - The central angle \( \angle AOB \) subtends the arc \( AB \).
  - The inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) subtends the same arc \( AB \).
  - According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

- **Relevant Relationships:**
  - \( \angle 9 = \angle ABC \) is part of the cyclic quadrilateral.
  - The measure of \( \angle 9 \) can be determined using the Inscribed Angle Theorem and properties of cyclic quadrilaterals.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \text{Measure of } \angle AOB = 120^\circ \).

- **Inferred Measurements:**
  - Since \( \angle AOB \) is a central angle, the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) that subtends the same arc \( AB \) is:
    \[
    \text{Measure of } \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } \angle AOB = \frac{1}{2} \times 120^\circ = 60^\circ.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 9 \), which is \( \angle ABC \).
- To find \( \angle ABC \), we need to use the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
- Since \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle ACB \) and \( \angle ABC \) are part of the cyclic quadrilateral, we can use the fact that opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to \( 180^\circ \) if necessary. However, the direct approach is through the Inscribed Angle Theorem.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the following:
  1. The circle and its center.
  2. The points on the circumference.
  3. The central angle \( \angle AOB \).
  4. The inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \).
  5. The relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle.

- Predicates will capture these relationships without directly stating the final answer.
