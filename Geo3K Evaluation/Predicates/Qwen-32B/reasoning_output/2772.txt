================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \widehat X Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present with center \( C \).
  - Points \( W, X, Y, Z, E, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( BX \) and \( DY \) are secants intersecting at point \( Z \) inside the circle.
  - Angles are marked at intersection points.
  
- **Labels and Measurements:**
  - \( \angle YZD = 68^\circ \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{WD} \) is labeled as \( 224^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Arrows indicate the direction of arcs around the circle.
  - No other specific markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruence are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - \( W, X, Y, Z, E, D \) are points on the circumference of the circle centered at \( C \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{WD} \) subtends an angle from the external intersection point \( Z \) via secants \( BX \) and \( DY \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - The angle formed by the secants at the intersection point \( Z \) is related to the intercepted arcs on the circle.
  - Specifically, \( \angle YZD \) is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs \( \widehat{XD} \) and \( \widehat{WY} \).

- **Secant-Secant Angle Theorem:**
  - The measure of the angle formed by two secants intersecting outside a circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \angle YZD = 68^\circ \).
  - \( \text{Measure of } \widehat{WD} = 224^\circ \).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Let \( \widehat{XD} = x \) and \( \widehat{WY} = y \). According to the secant-secant angle theorem:
    \[
    \angle YZD = \frac{1}{2} (\text{Measure of } \widehat{XD} - \text{Measure of } \widehat{WY})
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    68^\circ = \frac{1}{2} (x - y)
    \]
    Therefore:
    \[
    x - y = 136^\circ
    \]

- **Arc \( \widehat{WD} \):**
  - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \). Since \( \widehat{WD} = 224^\circ \), the remaining arc \( \widehat{DW} \) is:
    \[
    \widehat{DW} = 360^\circ - 224^\circ = 136^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \widehat{XZ} \).
- To find \( \widehat{XZ} \), we need to use the relationships between the arcs and the given angle \( \angle YZD \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, its center, and points on the circumference.
- Define the secants and their intersection point.
- Use the secant-secant angle theorem to establish relationships between the arcs.
- Ensure all given measurements and geometric properties are captured.
