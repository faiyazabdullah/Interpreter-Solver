QUESTION: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with labeled vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The sides of the quadrilateral are labeled with algebraic expressions:
  - \(AB = 2y + 12\)
  - \(BC = 3x - 18\)
  - \(CD = 5y\)
  - \(DA = 2x - 5\)
- There are no additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or symmetry indicators.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The goal is to determine the value of \(x\) such that the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.
- For a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, the following conditions must hold:
  1. Opposite sides are equal in length.
  2. Opposite sides are parallel (though this is implied by the first condition in Euclidean geometry).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The lengths of the sides are given as algebraic expressions:
  - \(AB = 2y + 12\)
  - \(BC = 3x - 18\)
  - \(CD = 5y\)
  - \(DA = 2x - 5\)
- To satisfy the parallelogram condition, we need:
  - \(AB = CD\) (opposite sides are equal)
  - \(BC = DA\) (opposite sides are equal)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- To solve this, we need to set up equations based on the equality of opposite sides:
  1. \(AB = CD \implies 2y + 12 = 5y\)
  2. \(BC = DA \implies 3x - 18 = 2x - 5\)
- Solving these equations will give us the values of \(x\) and \(y\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the relationships between the sides of the quadrilateral and the conditions for it to be a parallelogram.
- Predicates will be generated to express:
  1. The quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  2. The equality of opposite sides.
  3. The algebraic expressions for the side lengths.
