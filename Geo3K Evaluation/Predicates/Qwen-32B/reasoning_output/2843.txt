REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - Two triangles are shown: \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle QRS \).
  - Points labeled: \( L, M, N, Q, R, S \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines connecting the points form the sides of the triangles.
  - The sides are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( LM = 3x + 5 \)
    - \( MN = y + 6 \)
    - \( LN = 2x + 10 \)
    - \( QR = 2x + 10 \)
    - \( RS = 2y - 12 \)
    - \( QS = 3x + 5 \)

- **Angles**:
  - Angles at points \( N \) and \( S \) are marked with expressions involving \( y \):
    - \( \angle MNL = (y + 6)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle RQS = (2y - 12)^\circ \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles are marked at points \( M \) and \( R \):
    - \( \angle LMR \) and \( \angle QRS \) are right angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruence**:
  - The problem states \( \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS \). This implies:
    - Corresponding sides are equal: \( LM = QR \), \( MN = RS \), \( LN = QS \).
    - Corresponding angles are equal: \( \angle LMN = \angle QRS \), \( \angle MNL = \angle RQS \), \( \angle MLN = \angle QSR \).

- **Right Triangles**:
  - Both \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle QRS \) are right triangles because they have right angles at \( M \) and \( R \), respectively.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Expressions**:
  - Side lengths are given as algebraic expressions:
    - \( LM = 3x + 5 \)
    - \( MN = y + 6 \)
    - \( LN = 2x + 10 \)
    - \( QR = 2x + 10 \)
    - \( RS = 2y - 12 \)
    - \( QS = 3x + 5 \)
  - Angles are also given as expressions:
    - \( \angle MNL = (y + 6)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle RQS = (2y - 12)^\circ \)

- **Relationships**:
  - Since the triangles are congruent, corresponding sides and angles must be equal:
    - \( LM = QR \)
    - \( MN = RS \)
    - \( LN = QS \)
    - \( \angle MNL = \angle RQS \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the fact that corresponding sides of congruent triangles are equal. Specifically, we equate the expressions for the sides \( LM \) and \( QR \), and \( LN \) and \( QS \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will capture the congruence of triangles, the equality of corresponding sides, the presence of right angles, and the expressions for side lengths and angles.
