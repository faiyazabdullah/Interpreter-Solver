REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(F\).
  - The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram based on the labeling.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \(AD = 13\)
  - \(DC = 10\)
  - \(BC = 2x + 7\)
  - \(AB = 3y - 8\)

- **Angles:**
  - \(\angle D = 59^\circ\)
  - \(\angle B = 20^\circ\)
  - \(\angle AFC = 49^\circ\) (at the intersection of diagonals).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No explicit markings for right angles, parallel sides, or congruence, but the context suggests \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties:**
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AD = BC\) and \(AB = DC\).
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Consecutive angles are supplementary.
  - Diagonals bisect each other.

- **Given Constraints:**
  - \(AD = 13\) and \(DC = 10\).
  - \(BC = 2x + 7\) and \(AB = 3y - 8\).
  - Using the parallelogram property, we equate opposite sides:
    - \(AD = BC \implies 13 = 2x + 7\)
    - \(AB = DC \implies 3y - 8 = 10\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \(AD = 13\)
  - \(DC = 10\)
  - \(\angle D = 59^\circ\)
  - \(\angle B = 20^\circ\)
  - \(\angle AFC = 49^\circ\)

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram:
    - \(AD = BC \implies 13 = 2x + 7\)
    - \(AB = DC \implies 3y - 8 = 10\).
  - Solving these equations gives:
    - \(2x + 7 = 13 \implies x = 3\)
    - \(3y - 8 = 10 \implies y = 6\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m\angle DAB\).
- In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore:
  - \(\angle DAB + \angle D = 180^\circ\).
  - Given \(\angle D = 59^\circ\), we have:
    - \(\angle DAB = 180^\circ - 59^\circ = 121^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using atomic predicates.
- The predicates should capture the shape, measurements, and angle relationships without directly solving for the final answer.
