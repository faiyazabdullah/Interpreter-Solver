================================================================================
QUESTION: Circle O has a radius of 13 inches. Radius O B is perpendicular to chord C D which is 24 inches long. Find O X.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Circle with center \( O \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, X \) are labeled.
  - \( O \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( B \) lies on the circle, so \( OB \) is a radius.
  - \( CD \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( X \) is a point where the radius \( OB \) intersects the chord \( CD \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( OB \) is a radius of the circle.
  - \( CD \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( BX \) and \( DX \) are segments of the chord \( CD \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle OXB \), indicating \( OB \perp CD \).
  - \( CD \) is marked as 24 inches long.

- **Measurements:**
  - Radius \( OB = 13 \) inches.
  - Chord \( CD = 24 \) inches.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \), meaning \( OB \perp CD \).
  - Since \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \), \( X \) is the midpoint of \( CD \). This is a property of a radius perpendicular to a chord.
  - \( OX \) is part of the radius \( OB \), and \( BX \) is the remaining segment of the radius.
  - \( CX = XD = \frac{CD}{2} = 12 \) inches (since \( X \) is the midpoint of \( CD \)).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - Radius \( OB = 13 \) inches.
  - Chord \( CD = 24 \) inches.
  - Since \( X \) is the midpoint of \( CD \), \( CX = XD = 12 \) inches.

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - In the right triangle \( OXC \), we know:
    - \( OC = 13 \) inches (radius).
    - \( CX = 12 \) inches.
    - We need to find \( OX \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of \( OX \).
- To solve this, we use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( OXC \):
  \[
  OC^2 = OX^2 + CX^2
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  13^2 = OX^2 + 12^2
  \]
  Solving for \( OX \):
  \[
  169 = OX^2 + 144 \implies OX^2 = 25 \implies OX = 5 \text{ inches}.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will include:
  - Definitions of points, lines, and circles.
  - Relationships such as perpendicularity and midpoints.
  - Measurements of lengths and radii.
  - Geometric properties like the Pythagorean theorem for the right triangle \( OXC \).
