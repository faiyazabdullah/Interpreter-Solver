STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2525
================================================================================
QUESTION: Given that the perimeter of \triangle A B C = 25, find x. Assume that segments that appear tangent to circles are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a circle centered at point \( A \).
  - Points \( B \), \( C \), and \( E \) lie on the circumference of the circle.

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Line segment \( AE \) is a radius of the circle.
  - Line segment \( BE \) appears to be a tangent to the circle at point \( E \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The length of \( AB \) is given as \( 3x \).
  - The length of \( AE \) is given as 7 (since \( AE \) is a radius of the circle).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Point \( E \) is marked as the point where the circle touches the line segment \( BC \), suggesting that \( BE \) is tangent to the circle at \( E \).
  - The circle is tangent to the sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) of the triangle.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a triangle with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The circle is inscribed in \( \triangle ABC \), meaning it is tangent to all three sides of the triangle.
  - \( AE \) is a radius of the circle and is perpendicular to the tangent \( BE \) at the point of tangency \( E \).
  - Since the circle is inscribed, the lengths of the tangents from a point outside the circle to the points of tangency are equal. Thus:
    - The length of the tangent from \( B \) to the point of tangency on \( AB \) is equal to the length of the tangent from \( B \) to \( E \).
    - Similarly, the length of the tangent from \( C \) to the point of tangency on \( AC \) is equal to the length of the tangent from \( C \) to \( E \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 3x \).
  - The radius of the circle \( AE = 7 \).
  - The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is given as 25.

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Let the length of \( BC \) be \( y \).
  - Let the length of \( AC \) be \( z \).
  - Using the property of tangents from a point to a circle, we can express the sides of the triangle in terms of \( x \) and \( y \):
    - The tangent from \( B \) to the point of tangency on \( AB \) is \( 3x - 7 \) (since \( AB = 3x \) and the radius is 7).
    - The tangent from \( B \) to \( E \) is also \( 3x - 7 \).
    - The tangent from \( C \) to the point of tangency on \( AC \) is \( z - 7 \).
    - The tangent from \( C \) to \( E \) is also \( z - 7 \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \) given that the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is 25.
- The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is the sum of its sides:
  \[
  AB + BC + AC = 25
  \]
- Using the relationships from the tangents, we can express the sides in terms of \( x \) and solve for \( x \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the structure of the triangle, the circle, the tangency conditions, and the given measurements.
