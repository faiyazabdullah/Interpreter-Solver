QUESTION: Find the area of the regular polygon. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image depicts a **regular hexagon** \( GHEFCD \).
  - There is a central point \( B \) inside the hexagon.
  - A smaller triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed within the hexagon, with its base \( AC \) lying along one side of the hexagon.
  - The hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles by lines connecting the center \( B \) to each vertex.

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - The sides of the hexagon are straight lines.
  - The lines from the center \( B \) to the vertices of the hexagon divide it into six equal sections.
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has its base \( AC \) aligned with one side of the hexagon, and \( B \) appears to be the centroid or center of the hexagon.

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - The length of segment \( AC \) is given as \( 3 \) meters.
  - The hexagon is shaded blue, indicating it is the primary focus.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No specific angle markings or right-angle symbols are present.
  - The symmetry of the hexagon suggests regularity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Regular Hexagon Properties**:
  - A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal internal angles (\( 120^\circ \) each).
  - The distance from the center \( B \) to any vertex is the same (radius of the circumscribed circle).

- **Relationships Between Elements**:
  - The hexagon is divided into six equilateral triangles by lines from the center \( B \) to each vertex.
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed such that \( AC \) is one side of the hexagon.
  - Since \( AC = 3 \) meters, each side of the hexagon is also \( 3 \) meters.

- **Geometric Constraints**:
  - The hexagon is regular, so all sides and angles are equal.
  - The center \( B \) is equidistant from all vertices.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - Length of \( AC = 3 \) meters.
  - Since \( AC \) is a side of the hexagon, each side of the hexagon is \( 3 \) meters.

- **Implications**:
  - The apothem (perpendicular distance from the center to a side) and other dimensions can be derived using properties of a regular hexagon.
  - The radius of the circumscribed circle is equal to the side length of the hexagon, i.e., \( 3 \) meters.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The question asks for the area of the regular hexagon.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The area of a regular hexagon can be calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Area} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2
    \]
    where \( s \) is the side length of the hexagon.
  - Here, \( s = 3 \) meters.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the hexagon and its properties.
  - Specify the side length.
  - Indicate the regularity and symmetry.
  - Relate the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) to the hexagon.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are represented.
