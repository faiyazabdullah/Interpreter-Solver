### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Two triangles are shown: \( \triangle EFG \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Both triangles have their bases lying on a horizontal line, with the vertices \( G \) and \( H \) on one side, and \( F \) and \( B \) on the other.
  - \( \triangle EFG \) has a vertical side \( EF \) and a slanted side \( EG \).
  - \( \triangle ABC \) has a vertical side \( AB \) and a slanted side \( AC \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The base of \( \triangle EFG \) is \( FG \), with \( FG = 12 \).
  - The base of \( \triangle ABC \) is \( BC \), with \( BC = 15 \).
  - The vertical side \( AB \) of \( \triangle ABC \) is labeled as 10.
  - The height from \( E \) to \( FG \) is labeled as \( x \).
  - The height from \( A \) to \( BC \) is also 10 (since \( AB \) is vertical).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The triangles are marked with congruent angles, indicating that \( \triangle EFG \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are similar.
  - The parallel lines ensure that the triangles maintain the same angle structure.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similar Triangles**:
  - The triangles \( \triangle EFG \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are similar because they share corresponding angles (marked with congruent arcs).
  - Similarity implies that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

- **Proportional Relationships**:
  - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the heights to the bases will be the same:
    \[
    \frac{\text{Height of } \triangle EFG}{\text{Height of } \triangle ABC} = \frac{\text{Base of } \triangle EFG}{\text{Base of } \triangle ABC}
    \]
  - Let the height of \( \triangle EFG \) be \( x \). The height of \( \triangle ABC \) is 10.

- **Parallel Lines**:
  - The parallel lines ensure that the triangles maintain their similarity.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( FG = 12 \)
  - \( BC = 15 \)
  - \( AB = 10 \) (height of \( \triangle ABC \))
  - \( x \) is the height of \( \triangle EFG \).

- **Relationship Between Heights and Bases**:
  - The ratio of the heights is equal to the ratio of the bases:
    \[
    \frac{x}{10} = \frac{12}{15}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), the height of \( \triangle EFG \).
- To find \( x \), we use the similarity property of the triangles and the proportional relationship between the heights and bases.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric shapes, similarity, measurements, and proportional relationships.
- Predicates will capture the similarity, the proportional relationship, and the given measurements.
