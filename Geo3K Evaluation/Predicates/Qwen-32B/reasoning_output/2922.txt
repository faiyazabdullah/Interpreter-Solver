================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present with center \( E \).
  - Four points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Two tangents from point \( D \) touch the circle at points \( A \) and \( F \).
  - Two secants pass through the circle, connecting points \( C \) and \( D \), and points \( B \) and \( D \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - The external segment \( DA \) has a length of \( 3x \).
  - The external segment \( DF \) has a length of \( 8 \).
  - The internal segment \( AF \) has a length of \( x + 2 \).
  - The internal segment \( CF \) has a length of \( x \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The segments \( DA \) and \( DF \) are tangent to the circle at points \( A \) and \( F \), respectively.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Tangent-Secant Theorem:**
  - The tangent-secant theorem states that for a circle, if a tangent and a secant are drawn from an external point, the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant segment and its external part.
  - For tangent \( DA \) and secant \( DC \):
    \[
    DA^2 = DB \cdot DC
    \]
  - For tangent \( DF \) and secant \( DE \):
    \[
    DF^2 = DG \cdot DE
    \]

- **Tangent Segments:**
  - Since \( DA \) and \( DF \) are tangent segments from the same external point \( D \), they are equal in length:
    \[
    DA = DF
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( DA = 3x \)
  - \( DF = 8 \)
  - \( AF = x + 2 \)
  - \( CF = x \)

- **Relationships:**
  - Since \( DA = DF \), we have:
    \[
    3x = 8
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we use the equality \( 3x = 8 \) derived from the tangent-segment property.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the geometric shapes, points, lines, and relationships.
- Capture the tangent-segment equality and the given measurements.
- Ensure all visible constraints and properties are included.
