REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure shows a regular hexagon labeled \( U, V, W, X, Y, Z \).
  - There are additional points \( A \) and \( B \) inside the hexagon, connected by lines forming internal triangles and segments.
  - The hexagon is divided into smaller triangles and quadrilaterals.

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - The sides of the hexagon are labeled as equal lengths (since it is a regular hexagon).
  - Internal lines connect vertices and interior points, such as \( WY \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The side length of the hexagon is explicitly stated as 12 cm.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The hexagon is marked as regular, implying all sides are equal, and all internal angles are \( 120^\circ \).
  - The internal segments and triangles appear symmetric due to the regularity of the hexagon.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Hexagon Properties:**
  - A regular hexagon has all sides equal and all internal angles equal to \( 120^\circ \).
  - The center of the hexagon is equidistant from all vertices.
  - Diagonals connecting opposite vertices (e.g., \( WY \)) are diameters of the circumscribed circle.

- **Internal Relationships:**
  - The line \( WY \) is a diagonal of the hexagon, passing through the center.
  - Since the hexagon is regular, \( WY \) is twice the side length of the hexagon.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - Side length of the hexagon: \( UV = VW = WX = XY = YZ = ZU = 12 \) cm.

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - In a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite vertices (a diagonal like \( WY \)) is twice the side length.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( WY \).
- From the properties of a regular hexagon, \( WY \) is a diagonal connecting opposite vertices, which is equal to twice the side length of the hexagon.
- Therefore, \( WY = 2 \times 12 = 24 \) cm.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the hexagon, its regularity, the side lengths, and the relationship between the diagonal \( WY \) and the side length.
- The predicates should capture the geometric properties and relationships without directly stating the final answer.
