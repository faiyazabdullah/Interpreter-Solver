REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle with center \( O \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( O \) is the center of the circle.

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters of the circle.
  - Lines \( OD, OE, OF, OA, OB, OC, OD \) are radii of the circle.

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are marked as congruent.
  - \( \angle FOB \) is a right angle (marked with a square).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Congruent angles are indicated by arcs.
  - Right angles are indicated by square symbols.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Diameters:**
  - \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, so they pass through the center \( O \) and are equal in length.
  - Since \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they divide the circle into two semicircles.

- **Radii:**
  - \( OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF \) are radii of the circle, so they are all equal in length.

- **Congruent Angles:**
  - \( \angle BOD \cong \angle DOE \cong \angle EOF \cong \angle FOA \). This implies that the circle is divided into four equal central angles.

- **Right Angle:**
  - \( \angle FOB \) is a right angle, confirming that the circle is symmetrically divided.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Central Angles:**
  - Since the circle is divided into four equal central angles and the total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \), each central angle is:
    \[
    \frac{360^\circ}{4} = 90^\circ.
    \]
  - Therefore, \( \angle BOD = \angle DOE = \angle EOF = \angle FOA = 90^\circ \).

- **Arc Measures:**
  - Each arc corresponding to a \( 90^\circ \) central angle will have a measure of \( 90^\circ \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the measure of the arc \( \widehat{AD} \).
- From the analysis, we know that the circle is divided into four equal parts by the diameters \( EC \) and \( AB \), and the central angles are each \( 90^\circ \).
- The arc \( \widehat{AD} \) corresponds to one of these central angles, \( \angle DOA \), which measures \( 90^\circ \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the circle, its center, radii, diameters, congruent angles, and the relationship between central angles and arcs.
