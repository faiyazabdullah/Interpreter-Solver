REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Three circles labeled as \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), and \(\odot C\) are shown.
  - Points \(E, X, Z\) lie on \(\odot A\).
  - Points \(B, Y\) lie on \(\odot B\).
  - Points \(C, W, D\) lie on \(\odot C\).
  - Points \(A, B, C\) are centers of the respective circles.
  - Lines are drawn connecting points across the circles, forming diameters and tangents.

- **Measurements and Annotations:**
  - Diameters of the circles:
    - \(\odot A\): Diameter = 10 units.
    - \(\odot B\): Diameter = 30 units.
    - \(\odot C\): Diameter = 10 units.
  - Given: \(AZ \cong CW\) and \(CW = 2\).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The segments \(AZ\) and \(CW\) are marked as congruent (\(AZ \cong CW\)).
  - The segment \(CW\) is explicitly stated to have a length of 2 units.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \(\odot A\), \(\odot B\), and \(\odot C\) are tangent to each other along the line \(ED\).
  - \(AZ\) and \(CW\) are radii of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\), respectively, and are congruent.
  - \(B\) is the center of \(\odot B\), and \(BY\) is a radius of \(\odot B\).
  - \(ED\) is a straight line passing through the centers of all three circles.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - Since \(AZ \cong CW\) and \(CW = 2\), it follows that \(AZ = 2\).
  - The diameters of the circles determine their radii:
    - Radius of \(\odot A\) = \(5\) units.
    - Radius of \(\odot B\) = \(15\) units.
    - Radius of \(\odot C\) = \(5\) units.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - Diameter of \(\odot A\) = 10 units → Radius of \(\odot A\) = 5 units.
  - Diameter of \(\odot B\) = 30 units → Radius of \(\odot B\) = 15 units.
  - Diameter of \(\odot C\) = 10 units → Radius of \(\odot C\) = 5 units.
  - \(CW = 2\) units.
  - \(AZ = 2\) units (since \(AZ \cong CW\)).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The radii of \(\odot A\) and \(\odot C\) are both 5 units, and \(AZ\) and \(CW\) are segments within these radii.
  - The total length of the line \(ED\) can be determined by summing the relevant segments.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - Find the length of \(YW\).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The diameters and radii of the circles provide fixed lengths.
  - The congruence \(AZ \cong CW\) and the explicit length \(CW = 2\) allow us to deduce \(AZ = 2\).
  - The total length of the line \(ED\) is composed of segments involving the radii and given lengths.

- **Information Needed:**
  - Use the given diameters and the congruence \(AZ \cong CW\) to determine the relative positions of points \(Z\), \(W\), and \(Y\).
  - Calculate the distance \(YW\) based on the positions of \(Y\) and \(W\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the circles and their centers.
  - Specify the radii and diameters.
  - Indicate the congruence between \(AZ\) and \(CW\).
  - Represent the given lengths and positions of points.
  - Ensure all relationships are atomic and independent.
