STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2532
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present with center \( A \).
  - Points \( B, C, D, E \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( AB \), \( AD \), \( AE \), and \( AC \) are radii of the circle.
  - Angles are marked at various positions:
    - \( \angle BAD = 150^\circ \).
    - \( \angle DAE = 85^\circ \).
    - \( \angle CAE = x^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is marked at \( \angle BAC \), indicating \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Circumference and Radii:**
  - Points \( B, C, D, E \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( AB \), \( AD \), \( AE \), and \( AC \) are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BAD = 150^\circ \) is an arc subtended by the central angle from \( B \) to \( D \).
  - \( \angle DAE = 85^\circ \) is an arc subtended by the central angle from \( D \) to \( E \).
  - \( \angle CAE = x^\circ \) is the central angle we need to find.
  - \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \) is a right angle.

- **Circular Relationships:**
  - The total angle around the center \( A \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The sum of the central angles around point \( A \) must equal \( 360^\circ \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \angle BAD = 150^\circ \).
  - \( \angle DAE = 85^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).

- **Unknown Measurement:**
  - \( \angle CAE = x^\circ \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \), which is the measure of \( \angle CAE \).
- To find \( x \), we use the fact that the sum of all central angles around point \( A \) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key relationships involve the circle, its radii, and the central angles.
