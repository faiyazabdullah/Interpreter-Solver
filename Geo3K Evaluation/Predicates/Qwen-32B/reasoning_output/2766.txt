STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2766
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure contains triangles and a rectangle.
  - Key points are labeled: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - There is a vertical segment \( CD \) and a horizontal segment \( BC \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments: \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( AD \), \( AC \).
  - \( AB \) is horizontal.
  - \( BC \) is vertical.
  - \( CD \) is vertical.
  - \( AD \) is diagonal.

- **Measurements**:
  - \( CD = 16 \).
  - \( AD = 15 \).
  - \( BC = x \) (unknown).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles are indicated at \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle BCD \).
  - \( B \) lies on both \( AD \) and \( BC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABD = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle BCD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCD = 90^\circ \).
  - \( BC \) is shared between the two right triangles.
  - \( CD \) is the vertical side of \( \triangle BCD \).

- **Constraints**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to both right triangles.
  - The total height from \( C \) to \( D \) is split into \( BC \) and \( BD \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( CD = 16 \).
  - \( AD = 15 \).
  - \( BC = x \) (to be found).

- **Relationships**:
  - In \( \triangle ABD \): \( AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2 \).
  - In \( \triangle BCD \): \( BC^2 + CD^2 = BD^2 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of \( BC \).
- To find \( x \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem in both triangles and relate the segments \( BD \) and \( BC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all visible geometric shapes, points, lines, and relationships.
- Include all given measurements and constraints.
- Ensure all predicates are atomic and do not directly state the solution.
