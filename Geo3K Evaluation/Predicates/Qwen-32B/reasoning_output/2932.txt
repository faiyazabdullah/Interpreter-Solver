REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure shows a trapezoid \(ABCD\).
  - Points \(S\) and \(T\) are marked as midpoints of the legs \(AC\) and \(BD\), respectively.
  - The bases of the trapezoid are \(AB\) and \(CD\).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The bases \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel (\(AB \parallel CD\)).
  - The lengths are given:
    - \(CD = 14\)
    - \(ST = 10\)
    - \(AB = 2x\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No specific angle markings or right angles are indicated.
  - The midpoints \(S\) and \(T\) suggest the use of midsegment properties.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \(AB \parallel CD\) implies that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid.
  - \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints of the non-parallel sides \(AC\) and \(BD\), respectively.
  - The segment \(ST\) is the midsegment of the trapezoid, connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The midsegment \(ST\) of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases and its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases. This property is critical for solving the problem.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \(CD = 14\)
  - \(ST = 10\)
  - \(AB = 2x\).

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - According to the midsegment theorem for trapezoids, the length of the midsegment \(ST\) is the average of the lengths of the two bases:
    \[
    ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    10 = \frac{2x + 14}{2}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks us to find the value of \(x\).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The midsegment theorem for trapezoids is essential here:
    \[
    ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
    \]
  - We need to use this relationship to express \(x\) in terms of the given lengths.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the trapezoid and its properties.
  - Indicate the midpoints and the midsegment.
  - Capture the relationship between the bases and the midsegment.
  - Include all given measurements and their relationships.

- **Completeness Check**:
  - All visible information from the diagram is captured.
  - The relationships between the bases, midsegment, and midpoints are represented.
