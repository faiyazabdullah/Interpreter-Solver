QUESTION: Find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.
  
- **Measurements**:
  - The length of \( AC \) is explicitly given as 27.
  - The length of \( AB \) is expressed as \( 2x + 5 \).
  - The length of \( BC \) is expressed as \( 3x - 4 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - There are pink hash marks on \( AB \) and \( BC \), indicating that \( AB \) and \( BC \) are congruent.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruence**:
  - The pink hash marks on \( AB \) and \( BC \) imply that \( AB \cong BC \). Therefore, \( AB = BC \).

- **Triangle Properties**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a triangle with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Since \( AB = BC \), \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB \) and \( BC \) as the congruent sides.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The length of \( AC \) is given as 27.
  - The expressions for the lengths of \( AB \) and \( BC \) are:
    - \( AB = 2x + 5 \)
    - \( BC = 3x - 4 \)

- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( AB = BC \), we have the equation:
    \[
    2x + 5 = 3x - 4
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AB \).
- To find \( AB \), we need to solve for \( x \) using the congruence condition \( AB = BC \), and then substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( AB \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture:
  1. The triangle and its vertices.
  2. The congruence of \( AB \) and \( BC \).
  3. The lengths of the sides in terms of \( x \).
  4. The explicit length of \( AC \).
