================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Triangle \( \triangle ABD \) with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \).
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle BDC \) and \( \angle ADB \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), \( AC \), and \( BD \).
  - Segment \( BD \) is the altitude from \( B \) to \( AC \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 24 \) units.
  - \( BC = 14 \) units.
  - \( BD \) is the altitude whose length we need to find.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols at \( \angle BDC \) and \( \angle ADB \), indicating that \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( AC \).
  - \( D \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( B \) to \( AC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BAC \) as the right angle.
  - \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BDC \) are also right triangles formed by the altitude \( BD \).
  - \( BD \) is the altitude of \( \triangle ABC \) drawn to the hypotenuse \( AC \).
  - The altitude divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two smaller right triangles, \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BDC \), which are similar to \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - \( BD \perp AC \).
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to \( \triangle ABC \):
    \[
    AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
    \]
  - The altitude \( BD \) creates proportional relationships among the segments:
    \[
    BD^2 = AD \cdot DC
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AB = 24 \) units.
  - \( BC = 14 \) units.
  - The length of \( BD \) is the unknown we need to find.

- **Relationships**:
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can calculate \( AC \):
    \[
    AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{24^2 + 14^2}
    \]
  - Once \( AC \) is known, we use the properties of the altitude in a right triangle to find \( BD \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of the altitude \( BD \) drawn to the hypotenuse \( AC \) of \( \triangle ABC \).
- To solve this, we need to:
  1. Calculate the length of the hypotenuse \( AC \).
  2. Use the geometric property that the altitude \( BD \) in a right triangle satisfies:
     \[
     BD^2 = AD \cdot DC
     \]
     where \( AD \) and \( DC \) are segments of the hypotenuse \( AC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- Predicates should capture:
  - The right triangles and their properties.
  - The perpendicularity of \( BD \) to \( AC \).
  - The lengths of given segments.
  - The relationships among the segments created by the altitude.
