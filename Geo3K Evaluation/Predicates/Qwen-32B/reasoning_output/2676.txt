================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a large triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Inside \( \triangle ABC \), there is a smaller triangle \( \triangle AMN \) such that \( MN \parallel BC \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AB \) is one side of \( \triangle ABC \), with length 24.
  - \( BC \) is another side of \( \triangle ABC \), with length 20.
  - \( AC \) is the third side of \( \triangle ABC \), with length expressed as \( 3x - 2 \).
  - \( AM \) is a segment of \( AB \), with length \( 4x - 6 \).
  - \( AN \) is a segment of \( AC \), with length \( 3x - 2 \).

- **Parallel Markings**:
  - \( MN \parallel BC \) is explicitly stated.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem).

- **Similar Triangles**:
  - The similarity implies that corresponding sides of \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are proportional:
    \[
    \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{AN}{AC} = \frac{MN}{BC}
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 24 \)
  - \( BC = 20 \)
  - \( AC = 3x - 2 \)
  - \( AM = 4x - 6 \)
  - \( AN = 3x - 2 \)

- **Unknowns**:
  - The variable \( x \) needs to be determined using the proportionality of the similar triangles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem states that \( MN \parallel BC \), and we need to solve for \( x \).
- Using the similarity of triangles \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \), we can set up a proportion involving the segments \( AM \) and \( AB \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The key relationships are:
  1. \( \triangle AMN \sim \triangle ABC \) (similarity).
  2. Proportionality of corresponding sides: \( \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{AN}{AC} \).
  3. The lengths of the segments in terms of \( x \).
