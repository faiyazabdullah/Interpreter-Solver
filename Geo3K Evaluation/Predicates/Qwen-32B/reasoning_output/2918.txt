REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle FHK \) with points \( F, H, K \).
  - Inside the triangle, there is a segment \( GJ \) connecting points \( G \) and \( J \), which lie on the sides \( FH \) and \( HK \), respectively.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( FH \), \( HK \), and \( FK \) are sides of the triangle.
  - \( GH \) and \( HJ \) are segments within the triangle.
  - \( GJ \) is a line segment connecting points \( G \) and \( J \).

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - \( GH = x + 3.5 \)
  - \( HJ = x - 8.5 \)
  - \( FH = 21 \)
  - \( HK = 7 \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - The question specifies that \( GJ \parallel FK \), indicating that segment \( GJ \) is parallel to the base \( FK \) of the triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle FHK \) is a triangle with vertices \( F, H, K \).
  - \( GJ \parallel FK \) implies that \( GJ \) is a midsegment or a segment parallel to the base, dividing the triangle into similar smaller triangles.
  - Since \( GJ \parallel FK \), the segments \( GH \) and \( HJ \) divide \( FH \) and \( HK \) proportionally.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The parallel condition \( GJ \parallel FK \) imposes the similarity of triangles \( \triangle FGJ \) and \( \triangle FHK \).
  - The lengths \( GH \) and \( HJ \) must satisfy the proportional division of \( FH \) and \( HK \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( GH = x + 3.5 \)
  - \( HJ = x - 8.5 \)
  - \( FH = 21 \)
  - \( HK = 7 \)

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - Since \( GJ \parallel FK \), the ratio of the segments \( GH : HF \) must equal \( HJ : JK \). This is a direct consequence of the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' Theorem).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - Find the value of \( x \) such that \( GJ \parallel FK \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The condition \( GJ \parallel FK \) implies that the segments \( GH \) and \( HJ \) divide \( FH \) and \( HK \) proportionally.
  - Using the Basic Proportionality Theorem:
    \[
    \frac{GH}{HF} = \frac{HJ}{JK}
    \]
  - We need to express \( HF \) and \( JK \) in terms of the given lengths and solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the triangle, points, and lines.
  - Capture the parallel relationship \( GJ \parallel FK \).
  - Include the proportional division of segments \( GH \) and \( HJ \).
  - Use the given measurements and their relationships.
