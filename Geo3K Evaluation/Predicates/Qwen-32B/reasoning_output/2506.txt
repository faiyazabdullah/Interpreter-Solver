STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2506
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle K J L if J K = 2 b + 3 and J M = 3 a.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a parallelogram labeled \( JKLM \).
  - There is a point \( R \) inside the parallelogram, connected to vertices \( J \), \( K \), \( L \), and \( M \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \( JK = 2b + 3 \)
  - \( JM = 3a \)
  - \( KL = 21 \)
  - \( ML = 45 \)

- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle KLM = 70^\circ \)
  - \( \angle KML = 30^\circ \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - No explicit right angles, parallel lines, or congruence marks are indicated.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( JK = ML \) and \( KL = JM \).
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Adjacent angles are supplementary.

- **Triangle \( KLM \)**:
  - The triangle \( KLM \) has known angles \( \angle KLM = 70^\circ \) and \( \angle KML = 30^\circ \).
  - The third angle \( \angle LKM \) can be calculated as \( 180^\circ - 70^\circ - 30^\circ = 80^\circ \).

- **Relationship Between \( JK \) and \( ML \)**:
  - Since \( JKLM \) is a parallelogram, \( JK = ML \). Therefore, \( 2b + 3 = 45 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( KL = 21 \)
  - \( ML = 45 \)
  - \( JK = 2b + 3 \)
  - \( JM = 3a \)

- **Calculated Values**:
  - From \( JK = ML \), we have \( 2b + 3 = 45 \). Solving for \( b \):
    \[
    2b + 3 = 45 \implies 2b = 42 \implies b = 21.
    \]
  - The length of \( JK \) is therefore \( 2b + 3 = 45 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \angle KJL \).
- To find \( m \angle KJL \), we need to use the properties of the parallelogram and the triangle \( KLM \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the parallelogram properties, the triangle properties, and the angle relationships.
