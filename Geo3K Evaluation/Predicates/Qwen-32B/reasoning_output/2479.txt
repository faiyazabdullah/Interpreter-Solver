REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Left Figure:**
  - **Shapes:** Two polygons are shown: a quadrilateral \( RSTU \) and a triangle \( RVW \).
  - **Points:** \( R, S, T, U, V, W \).
  - **Lines:** \( RS, ST, TU, UR, RV, VW, WV \).
  - **Angles:** Right angles are marked at \( S, T, U, V \) (indicated by pink circular arcs).
  - **Measurements:** 
    - \( ST = 18 \) meters.
    - \( TU = y + 2 \) meters.
    - \( RV = x \) meters.

- **Right Figure:**
  - **Shapes:** A quadrilateral \( ABDE \) and a triangle \( BCD \).
  - **Points:** \( A, B, C, D, E \).
  - **Lines:** \( AB, BD, DE, EA, BC, CD \).
  - **Angles:** Right angles are marked at \( B \) and \( E \) (indicated by pink circular arcs).
  - **Measurements:** 
    - \( AB = 4 \) meters.
    - \( BE = 3 \) meters.
    - \( CD = 5 \) meters.
    - \( AE = 5 \) meters.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Left Figure:**
  - The quadrilateral \( RSTU \) is a rectangle because it has four right angles.
  - The triangle \( RVW \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( V \).
  - The segments \( RV \) and \( VW \) form the legs of the right triangle \( RVW \).

- **Right Figure:**
  - The quadrilateral \( ABDE \) is a rectangle because it has two right angles at \( B \) and \( E \).
  - The triangle \( BCD \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).

- **Similarity:**
  - The problem states that the two polygons (the left quadrilateral \( RSTU \) and the right quadrilateral \( ABDE \)) are similar.
  - This implies that corresponding sides are proportional, and corresponding angles are equal.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Left Figure:**
  - \( ST = 18 \) meters (height of the rectangle \( RSTU \)).
  - \( TU = y + 2 \) meters (base of the rectangle \( RSTU \)).
  - \( RV = x \) meters (one side of the right triangle \( RVW \)).

- **Right Figure:**
  - \( AB = 4 \) meters (height of the rectangle \( ABDE \)).
  - \( BE = 3 \) meters (width of the rectangle \( ABDE \)).
  - \( CD = 5 \) meters (hypotenuse of the right triangle \( BCD \)).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \( UT \), the base of the rectangle \( RSTU \).
- Since the two polygons are similar, we can use the proportionality of corresponding sides to relate the dimensions of the two figures.
- The key relationship is:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Height of } RSTU}{\text{Height of } ABDE} = \frac{\text{Base of } RSTU}{\text{Base of } ABDE}
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \frac{18}{4} = \frac{y + 2}{3}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram using the provided predicate format.
- Ensure that all visible geometric constraints and properties are captured without directly stating the final answer.
