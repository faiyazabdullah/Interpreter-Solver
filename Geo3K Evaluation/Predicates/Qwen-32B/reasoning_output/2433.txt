QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:  
  - The figure contains a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.
  
- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:  
  - Side \( BC \) is labeled with a length of 17 units.
  - Side \( AB \) is labeled with the variable \( y \).
  - Side \( AC \) is labeled with the variable \( x \).

- **Angles and Special Markings**:  
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( A \), indicating \( \angle CAB = 90^\circ \).
  - There is an angle labeled \( 60^\circ \) at vertex \( C \), i.e., \( \angle BCA = 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:  
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle because \( \angle CAB = 90^\circ \).
  - Since \( \angle BCA = 60^\circ \), \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \)).
  - The triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, which has specific side ratios:  
    - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)) is half the hypotenuse (\( BC \)).
    - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( AC \)) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Relationships**:  
  - Given:  
    - \( BC = 17 \) (hypotenuse).  
    - \( \angle BCA = 60^\circ \), so \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \).  
  - From the 30-60-90 triangle properties:  
    - \( AB = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{17}{2} \).  
    - \( AC = \sqrt{3} \times AB = \sqrt{3} \times \frac{17}{2} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which corresponds to the length of side \( AC \).
- To find \( x \), we use the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle:
  - \( AB = \frac{BC}{2} = \frac{17}{2} \).
  - \( AC = \sqrt{3} \times AB = \sqrt{3} \times \frac{17}{2} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate framework.
- Ensure that the predicates capture the right triangle properties, angle measures, and side-length relationships without explicitly solving for \( x \).
