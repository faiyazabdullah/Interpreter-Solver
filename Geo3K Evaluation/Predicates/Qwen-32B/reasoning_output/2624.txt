REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \).
- **Lines**: 
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), and \( CE \) are visible.
  - Lines \( BD \) and \( BE \) form angles at point \( C \).
- **Angles**:
  - Two angles are explicitly labeled as \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \).
  - \( \angle 9 \) is formed by lines \( BC \) and \( CE \).
  - \( \angle 10 \) is formed by lines \( BC \) and \( BD \).
- **Measurements**:
  - No explicit lengths are given for the line segments.
  - The measures of the angles are expressed algebraically:
    - \( m\angle 9 = 2x - 4 \)
    - \( m\angle 10 = 2x + 4 \)
- **Special Markings**:
  - No special markings (like right angles or parallel lines) are evident.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on a straight line, forming a linear pair with \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \).
  - Since \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \) share a common vertex and side \( BC \), they form a linear pair.
  - The sum of the measures of a linear pair is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The measures of \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \) are given in terms of \( x \):
    - \( m\angle 9 = 2x - 4 \)
    - \( m\angle 10 = 2x + 4 \)
  - These expressions represent the angular measures, and their relationship is constrained by the linear pair property.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the measure of \( \angle 10 \).
- To solve this, we need to use the fact that \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \) are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).
- The relationship \( m\angle 9 + m\angle 10 = 180^\circ \) will allow us to solve for \( x \) and subsequently find \( m\angle 10 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The key relationships are:
  1. \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 10 \) form a linear pair.
  2. The sum of their measures is \( 180^\circ \).
  3. The measures of the angles are given in terms of \( x \).
