QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a smaller right triangle \( \triangle GBC \) within \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - Line segment \( BC \) is labeled with a length of 10 units.
  - Line segment \( CA \) is labeled with a length of 20 units.
  - Line segment \( AB \) has an unknown length denoted as \( x \).

- **Angles:**
  - There is a right angle at \( \angle BGC \) and \( \angle BCA \), indicated by the right angle symbols.
  - Angle \( y^\circ \) is marked at \( \angle CBG \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Both \( \triangle GBC \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are right triangles due to the right angle symbols.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle GBC \) share the side \( BC \).
  - Both triangles are right triangles because they have right angles at \( \angle BCA \) and \( \angle BGC \), respectively.
  - The triangles are similar by AA similarity (both have right angles and share \( \angle BCG \)).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
  - The side lengths of \( \triangle GBC \) are proportional to those of \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 10 \) units.
  - \( CA = 20 \) units.
  - \( AB = x \) (unknown).

- **Derived Information:**
  - Since \( \triangle GBC \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Specifically:
    \[
    \frac{BC}{CA} = \frac{BG}{AB}
    \]
  - We need to find \( x \), the length of \( AB \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks for the value of \( x \), the length of \( AB \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The similarity of triangles \( \triangle GBC \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The proportionality of corresponding sides in similar triangles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangles and their similarity.
  - Capture the right angles and side lengths.
  - Express the proportional relationship between the sides of the similar triangles.
