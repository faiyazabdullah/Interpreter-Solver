REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present.
  - Several points are labeled: \( A, B, C, D, E, G \).
  - Lines connecting these points form chords within the circle.
  - Specific segments are labeled with numerical values.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - Segment \( DE = 4 \).
  - Segment \( EC = 9 \).
  - Segments \( BE \) and \( AE \) are labeled as \( x \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings indicate perpendicularity, parallelism, or symmetry. However, the setup suggests the use of intersecting chords within a circle.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle, indicating they are part of the circle's boundary.
  - Chords \( AD \) and \( BC \) intersect at point \( E \) inside the circle.
  - The lengths of segments created by the intersection of chords are given, suggesting the application of the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The Intersecting Chords Theorem states that if two chords intersect inside a circle, the product of the lengths of the segments of one chord equals the product of the lengths of the segments of the other chord.
    \[
    AE \cdot BE = CE \cdot DE
    \]

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( DE = 4 \)
  - \( EC = 9 \)
  - \( AE = x \)
  - \( BE = x \)

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - Using the Intersecting Chords Theorem:
    \[
    AE \cdot BE = CE \cdot DE
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    x \cdot x = 9 \cdot 4
    \]
    \[
    x^2 = 36
    \]

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- From the analysis, we know \( x \) is related to the products of the segment lengths via the Intersecting Chords Theorem.
- Solving \( x^2 = 36 \) gives \( x = 6 \) (since \( x \) represents a length, it must be positive).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The key relationships involve the points, lines, and the application of the Intersecting Chords Theorem.
