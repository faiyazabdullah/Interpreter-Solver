### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J, Y \).
- **Lines**: The figure consists of multiple straight lines:
  - Line \( DY \) passes through points \( D \) and \( Y \).
  - Line \( YA \) passes through points \( Y \) and \( A \).
  - Line \( EB \) passes through points \( E \) and \( B \).
  - Line \( BI \) passes through points \( B \) and \( I \).
  - Line \( BG \) passes through points \( B \) and \( G \).
  - Line \( HG \) passes through points \( H \) and \( G \).
- **Angles**: Several angles are labeled with expressions involving variables:
  - \( \angle DYA = (3x - 15)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle BYA = (y + 25)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle EBG = 105^\circ \)
- **Special Markings**: No explicit markings for perpendicularity, parallelism, or congruence are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Linear Pair**: Since \( \angle DYA \) and \( \angle BYA \) share the common vertex \( Y \) and lie on a straight line, they form a linear pair. Therefore, their measures sum to \( 180^\circ \).
  \[
  \angle DYA + \angle BYA = 180^\circ
  \]
- **Straight Lines**: The lines \( DY \) and \( YA \) form a straight line, as do \( EB \) and \( BI \). This implies that the angles along these lines must satisfy the linear pair property.
- **Given Angle**: The angle \( \angle EBG = 105^\circ \) is explicitly given, but its relationship to other angles is not immediately obvious without further context.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle EBG = 105^\circ \)
  - Expressions for angles:
    - \( \angle DYA = (3x - 15)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle BYA = (y + 25)^\circ \)
- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( \angle DYA \) and \( \angle BYA \) form a linear pair, we have:
    \[
    (3x - 15) + (y + 25) = 180
    \]
  - Simplifying this equation will help us find the value of \( y \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of the variable \( y \).
- To find \( y \), we need to use the linear pair relationship between \( \angle DYA \) and \( \angle BYA \):
  \[
  (3x - 15) + (y + 25) = 180
  \]
- Solving this equation will give us the value of \( y \) in terms of \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram using predicates.
- The key relationships involve the linear pair property and the given angle measures.
- Predicates will capture the angles, their measures, and the linear pair relationship.
