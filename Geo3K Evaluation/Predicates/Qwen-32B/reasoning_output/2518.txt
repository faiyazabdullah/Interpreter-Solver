REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure is a right triangle with vertices labeled \( V \), \( W \), and \( X \).
  - The right angle is at point \( W \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The hypotenuse \( VX \) is labeled as 75 units.
  - One leg \( VW \) is labeled as 72 units.
  - The other leg \( WX \) is labeled as 21 units.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right angle symbol at \( W \) indicates that \( \angle VWX = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle VWX \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( W \).
  - The sides \( VW \) and \( WX \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - The side \( VX \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( VW = 72 \) units.
  - \( WX = 21 \) units.
  - \( VX = 75 \) units.

- **Measurement Relationships**:
  - These measurements satisfy the Pythagorean theorem for a right triangle:
    \[
    VX^2 = VW^2 + WX^2
    \]
    Substituting the values:
    \[
    75^2 = 72^2 + 21^2
    \]
    \[
    5625 = 5184 + 441
    \]
    \[
    5625 = 5625
    \]
    Thus, the measurements are consistent with the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Question**: Express the ratio of \( \cos X \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
  - For \( \angle X \), the adjacent side is \( WX \) and the hypotenuse is \( VX \).
  - Therefore, \( \cos X = \frac{WX}{VX} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the triangle and its properties.
  - Specify the lengths of the sides.
  - Indicate the right angle.
  - Capture the relationship for \( \cos X \) without directly calculating it.
