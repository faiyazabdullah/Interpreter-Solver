REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Triangle \( \triangle AEC \) is the main triangle.
  - Points \( A, E, C \) form the vertices of \( \triangle AEC \).
  - Points \( B, D, F \) are additional points inside the triangle.
  - Point \( P \) is labeled as the incenter of \( \triangle AEC \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines \( AE, EC, CA \) form the sides of \( \triangle AEC \).
  - Other segments include \( AP, EP, CP, BP, DP, FP \).

- **Angles:**
  - Angles at vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are marked with specific measures or right-angle symbols.
    - \( \angle BAC = 33^\circ \)
    - \( \angle ACB = 28.5^\circ \)
    - Right angles are marked at \( \angle ABP, \angle BDP, \angle CEP, \angle DFP \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 10.9 \)
  - \( AF = 13 \)
  - \( EF = 14.9 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angles are indicated by square symbols at \( \angle ABP, \angle BDP, \angle CEP, \angle DFP \).
  - Point \( P \) is explicitly stated as the incenter of \( \triangle AEC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships:**
  - \( P \) is the incenter of \( \triangle AEC \), meaning it is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \( \triangle AEC \).
  - Lines \( AP, EP, CP \) are angle bisectors of \( \angle EAC, \angle AEC, \angle ACE \), respectively.
  - Right angles indicate perpendicularity at specific points:
    - \( BP \perp AC \)
    - \( DP \perp AE \)
    - \( FP \perp CE \)
    - \( EP \perp AB \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( AB = 10.9 \): Length of segment \( AB \).
  - \( AF = 13 \): Length of segment \( AF \).
  - \( EF = 14.9 \): Length of segment \( EF \).
  - Angles:
    - \( \angle BAC = 33^\circ \)
    - \( \angle ACB = 28.5^\circ \)

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( P \) is the incenter, the angles around \( P \) are bisected. For example, \( \angle BAP = \frac{1}{2} \angle BAC \) and so on.
  - The right angles imply that \( P \) is equidistant from the sides of \( \triangle AEC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:** Find \( m\angle DEP \).
- **Relevant Information:**
  - \( P \) is the incenter, so \( EP \) is the angle bisector of \( \angle AEC \).
  - \( \angle DEP \) is part of the configuration involving the incenter and the right angles.
  - The right angles at \( D \) and \( E \) suggest that \( DE \) is related to the perpendicular distances from \( P \) to the sides of \( \triangle AEC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the triangle and its components.
  - Specify the incenter and its properties.
  - Capture the right angles and perpendicular relationships.
  - Include angle measures and angle bisectors.
  - Relate the angles around point \( P \) and the incenter properties.
