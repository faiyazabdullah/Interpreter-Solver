STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2474
================================================================================
QUESTION: parallelogram M N P Q with m \angle M = 10 x and m \angle N = 20 x, find \angle M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure shows a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( M, N, P, Q \).
  - The quadrilateral is marked as a parallelogram (\(\text{Parallelogram}(M, N, P, Q)\)).
  
- **Lines and Angles**:
  - The sides of the parallelogram are indicated by lines \( MN, NP, PQ, \) and \( QM \).
  - Angles are marked at vertices \( M, N, P, \) and \( Q \). Specifically:
    - \( m\angle M = 10x \)
    - \( m\angle N = 20x \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - The figure uses red arcs to indicate the angles at vertices \( M, N, P, \) and \( Q \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Parallelogram**:
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \( MN \parallel PQ \) and \( MP \parallel NQ \).
  - Opposite angles are equal: \( \angle M = \angle P \) and \( \angle N = \angle Q \).
  - Adjacent angles are supplementary: \( \angle M + \angle N = 180^\circ \) and \( \angle P + \angle Q = 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle M = 10x \)
  - \( m\angle N = 20x \)

- **Implications**:
  - Since \( \angle M \) and \( \angle N \) are adjacent angles in the parallelogram, they must satisfy the supplementary property:
    \[
    m\angle M + m\angle N = 180^\circ
    \]
  - Substituting the given expressions:
    \[
    10x + 20x = 180^\circ
    \]
    \[
    30x = 180^\circ
    \]
    \[
    x = 6^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \( \angle M \).
- From the given information, \( m\angle M = 10x \).
- Using the calculated value of \( x = 6^\circ \):
  \[
  m\angle M = 10 \times 6^\circ = 60^\circ
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the shape, angles, and relationships without directly solving for the final answer.
