REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram contains a rectangle with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( W \).
  - There is a dashed line extending horizontally from \( W \) to \( W' \).
  - Another point \( F \) lies to the left of \( W' \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BW \), and \( AW \) form a rectangle.
  - Line segment \( WW' \) is horizontal and has a length of 8 units.
  - Line segment \( FW' \) is horizontal and has a total length of 12 units.

- **Measurements**:
  - The distance between \( W \) and \( W' \) is labeled as 8 units.
  - The total distance from \( F \) to \( W \) via \( W' \) is labeled as 12 units.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right-angle symbol at \( A \) indicates that \( \angle BAW \) is a right angle.
  - The dashed lines suggest reflections or projections.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( ABW \) forms a rectangle.
  - \( WW' \) is a horizontal segment extending from \( W \).
  - \( FW' \) is a horizontal segment extending from \( F \) to \( W' \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - Since \( ABW \) is a rectangle, \( AB \parallel WW' \) and \( AW \perp BW \).
  - The dashed lines suggest symmetry or scaling relationships.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( WW' = 8 \) units.
  - \( FW' = 12 \) units.
  - The distance from \( F \) to \( W' \) is composed of two parts: \( x \) (distance from \( F \) to \( W' \)) and 8 units (distance from \( W' \) to \( W \)).

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - The total distance \( FW' = x + 8 \).
  - Since \( FW' = 12 \), we can deduce that \( x = 12 - 8 = 4 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \)**.
- To determine the scale factor, we need to compare the distances involved:
  - The distance from \( W \) to \( W' \) is 8 units.
  - The distance from \( F \) to \( W' \) is 12 units, and the distance from \( F \) to \( W \) is \( x + 8 = 12 \) units.
  - The scale factor is determined by the ratio of the distances involved.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the geometric shapes and points.
  - Define the relationships between the points and lines.
  - Capture the measurements and their relationships.
  - Ensure all visible information is included without solving the problem directly.
