REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle labeled \( \triangle DEF \).
- Points \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) are the vertices of the triangle.
- The sides are labeled:
  - \( DE = f \)
  - \( EF = d \)
  - \( DF = e \)
- Angles are given:
  - \( \angle E = 108^\circ \)
  - \( \angle F = 26^\circ \)
- The length of side \( DE \) is given as \( f = 20 \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \( \triangle DEF \) is a scalene triangle since no equal sides or angles are indicated.
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can find \( \angle D \):
  \[
  \angle D = 180^\circ - \angle E - \angle F = 180^\circ - 108^\circ - 26^\circ = 46^\circ
  \]
- The Law of Sines can be used to relate the sides and angles of the triangle:
  \[
  \frac{DE}{\sin(\angle F)} = \frac{EF}{\sin(\angle D)} = \frac{DF}{\sin(\angle E)}
  \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given:
  - \( f = DE = 20 \)
  - \( \angle E = 108^\circ \)
  - \( \angle F = 26^\circ \)
  - \( \angle D = 46^\circ \)
- We need to find the length of side \( EF = d \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of side \( EF = d \) to the nearest whole number.
- To solve this, we use the Law of Sines:
  \[
  \frac{f}{\sin(\angle F)} = \frac{d}{\sin(\angle D)}
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \frac{20}{\sin(26^\circ)} = \frac{d}{\sin(46^\circ)}
  \]
  Solving for \( d \):
  \[
  d = \frac{20 \cdot \sin(46^\circ)}{\sin(26^\circ)}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, its sides, angles, and the given measurements.
- The relationships between the sides and angles will be captured using the Law of Sines.
