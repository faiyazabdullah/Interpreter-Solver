### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - \( AB \) is one side of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is the base of the triangle.
  - \( CA \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( A \), indicated by the right angle symbol.
  - There is a \( 30^\circ \) angle at vertex \( B \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The length of side \( AC \) is denoted as \( y \).
  - The length of side \( BC \) is denoted as \( x \).
  - The length of side \( AB \) is given as 6 units.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - The triangle has a \( 30^\circ \)-\( 60^\circ \)-\( 90^\circ \) angle configuration because one angle is \( 30^\circ \) and another is \( 90^\circ \).
  - In a \( 30^\circ \)-\( 60^\circ \)-\( 90^\circ \) triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).

- **Constraints**:
  - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)) is half the hypotenuse (\( CA \)).
  - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( BC \)) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 6 \) units.
  - \( \angle B = 30^\circ \).
  - \( \angle A = 90^\circ \).

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \( AB \) is the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle, it is half the length of the hypotenuse \( CA \).
  - Therefore, \( CA = 2 \times AB = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) units.
  - The side \( BC \) (opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side \( AB \):
    \[
    BC = AB \cdot \sqrt{3} = 6 \cdot \sqrt{3}.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \), which is the length of the hypotenuse \( CA \).
- From the properties of a \( 30^\circ \)-\( 60^\circ \)-\( 90^\circ \) triangle, we know:
  \[
  y = 2 \times AB = 2 \times 6 = 12.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The predicates will capture the structure of the triangle, the right angle, the \( 30^\circ \) angle, the side lengths, and the relationships between them.
