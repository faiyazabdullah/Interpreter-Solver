STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2640
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - There is a circle with center \( O \).
  - Several points are labeled on the circle and outside it: \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
  - Lines connect these points, forming segments and tangents.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( AD \) and \( CD \) appear to be tangents to the circle at points \( A \) and \( C \), respectively.
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( EF \) are chords within the circle.
  - Line segment \( DF \) connects point \( D \) outside the circle to point \( F \) on the circle.

- **Angles**:
  - An angle \( \angle AFD \) is marked as \( 3x^\circ \).
  - Another angle \( \angle CFD \) is marked as \( (4x + 50)^\circ \).
  - An external angle at \( D \) is marked as \( 30^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The red dots at points \( A \) and \( C \) suggest tangency points where the tangents \( AD \) and \( CD \) touch the circle.
  - The right-angle symbol at \( \angle AFD \) indicates that \( AD \) is tangent to the circle at \( A \).
  - Similarly, \( CD \) is tangent to the circle at \( C \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Tangency**:
  - Since \( AD \) and \( CD \) are tangents to the circle at points \( A \) and \( C \), respectively, they form right angles with the radii \( OA \) and \( OC \) at the points of tangency.
  - This implies:
    - \( \angle OAD = 90^\circ \)
    - \( \angle OCD = 90^\circ \)

- **External Angles**:
  - The external angle \( \angle CFD \) is formed by the intersection of tangents \( AD \) and \( CD \).
  - The measure of the external angle is given as \( (4x + 50)^\circ \).

- **Internal Angles**:
  - The angle \( \angle AFD \) inside the triangle \( AFD \) is given as \( 3x^\circ \).
  - The external angle at \( D \) is given as \( 30^\circ \).

- **Sum of Angles in Triangle**:
  - In triangle \( AFD \), the sum of the internal angles must be \( 180^\circ \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle AFD = 3x^\circ \)
  - \( \angle CFD = (4x + 50)^\circ \)
  - External angle at \( D = 30^\circ \)

- **Implications**:
  - Since \( AD \) and \( CD \) are tangents, the angles at the points of tangency are right angles.
  - The external angle theorem states that the external angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles in the triangle.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we need to use the relationships between the angles in the triangle \( AFD \) and the given external angle.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The predicates will capture the tangency, angle measures, and the external angle theorem.
