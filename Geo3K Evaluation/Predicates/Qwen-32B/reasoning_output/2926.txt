QUESTION: Find the area of the trapezoid.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - The figure is a trapezoid with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \).
  - The trapezoid has two parallel bases \( AD \) and \( BC \).

- **Points, Lines, and Angles:**
  - Points: \( A, B, C, D \).
  - Lines: \( AB, BC, CD, DA \).
  - Right angle symbols are present at \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle ADC \), indicating that \( AB \) and \( CD \) are perpendicular to the bases \( AD \) and \( BC \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( AD = 15 \) cm (length of the bottom base).
  - \( BC = 14 \) cm (length of the top base).
  - \( AB = 10 \) cm (height of the trapezoid, as it is perpendicular to both bases).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols at \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle ADC \) indicate that \( AB \) and \( CD \) are perpendicular to the bases.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Relationships:**
  - \( AD \parallel BC \) (bases of the trapezoid are parallel).

- **Perpendicular Relationships:**
  - \( AB \perp AD \) and \( AB \perp BC \).
  - \( CD \perp AD \) and \( CD \perp BC \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The trapezoid is a right trapezoid because it has two right angles.
  - The height of the trapezoid is the length of \( AB \), which is 10 cm.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( AD = 15 \) cm (bottom base).
  - \( BC = 14 \) cm (top base).
  - \( AB = 10 \) cm (height).

- **What Measurements Represent:**
  - \( AD \) and \( BC \) are the lengths of the parallel bases.
  - \( AB \) is the perpendicular distance between the bases (height).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **area of the trapezoid**.
- The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
  \]
- Here:
  - \( \text{Base}_1 = AD = 15 \) cm.
  - \( \text{Base}_2 = BC = 14 \) cm.
  - \( \text{Height} = AB = 10 \) cm.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates should capture the trapezoid's structure, parallelism, perpendicularity, and measurements without directly solving the problem.
