STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2581
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
- The sides of the quadrilateral are labeled with algebraic expressions:
  - \( AB = y + 11 \)
  - \( BC = x + 7 \)
  - \( CD = 3y - 5 \)
  - \( DA = 2x + 3 \)
- The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram, as indicated by the problem statement.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length.
- Therefore, we need to set up equations based on the equality of opposite sides:
  - \( AB = CD \)
  - \( BC = DA \)

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurements are given as algebraic expressions:
  - \( AB = y + 11 \)
  - \( BC = x + 7 \)
  - \( CD = 3y - 5 \)
  - \( DA = 2x + 3 \)
- These expressions represent the lengths of the sides of the quadrilateral.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- To do this, we use the property that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal:
  - From \( AB = CD \): \( y + 11 = 3y - 5 \)
  - From \( BC = DA \): \( x + 7 = 2x + 3 \)
- Solving these equations will give us the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the form of predicates.
- The key relationships are:
  - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
  - The algebraic expressions for the sides must be equated accordingly.
