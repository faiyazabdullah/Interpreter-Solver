STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2449
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle W.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: The image shows a quadrilateral \( UWYZ \) with vertices \( U, V, W, Y, Z \). The quadrilateral appears to be irregular.
- **Lines**: Lines connect the vertices \( U \) to \( V \), \( V \) to \( W \), \( W \) to \( Y \), \( Y \) to \( Z \), and \( Z \) to \( U \).
- **Angles**: The following angles are labeled:
  - \( \angle U = (x - 8)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle V = (3x - 11)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle W = x^\circ \)
  - \( \angle Y = x^\circ \)
  - \( \angle Z = (2x + 7)^\circ \)
- **Special Markings**: There is a right angle symbol at \( \angle Z \), indicating \( \angle Z = 90^\circ \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Quadrilateral Properties**: The quadrilateral \( UWYZ \) has four interior angles whose sum must equal \( 360^\circ \).
- **Right Angle Constraint**: Since \( \angle Z = 90^\circ \), we know one of the angles is fixed.
- **Variable Relationships**: The angles are expressed in terms of \( x \), suggesting a system of equations can be formed to solve for \( x \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values**: The angles are given as expressions involving \( x \):
  - \( \angle U = (x - 8)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle V = (3x - 11)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle W = x^\circ \)
  - \( \angle Y = x^\circ \)
  - \( \angle Z = (2x + 7)^\circ \)
- **Right Angle**: \( \angle Z = 90^\circ \) is explicitly marked, so \( 2x + 7 = 90 \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for \( m\angle W \), which is \( x^\circ \).
- To find \( m\angle W \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) using the sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral and the right angle constraint.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- Represent the quadrilateral and its properties.
- Capture the angle measurements and their relationships.
- Include the right angle constraint.
- Ensure all visible relationships and measurements are represented.
