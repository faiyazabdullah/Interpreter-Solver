REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A triangle \( \triangle RST \) is visible.
  - Points \( R, S, T \) are vertices of \( \triangle RST \).
  - Points \( X, Y, Z \) are marked within the triangle.
  - Lines \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are drawn inside the triangle.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - Line segment \( RT \) is labeled with a length of 13 units.
  - Line segment \( RX \) is labeled with a length of 7 units.
  - Angle \( \angle XYZ \) is marked as \( 124^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No explicit markings for perpendicularity, congruence, or symmetry are visible.
  - The problem states that \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments of \( \triangle RST \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Midsegments:**
  - By definition, a midsegment of a triangle is a line segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of the triangle.
  - Since \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments, \( X \) must be the midpoint of one side, and \( Y \) and \( Z \) must be midpoints of the other two sides.
  - Midsegments are parallel to the third side and half its length.

- **Parallelism:**
  - Midsegment \( XY \) is parallel to \( ST \).
  - Midsegment \( XZ \) is parallel to \( RT \).

- **Proportional Lengths:**
  - Since \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments, they divide the triangle into smaller similar triangles and parallelograms.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( RT = 13 \) units.
  - \( RX = 7 \) units.
  - \( \angle XYZ = 124^\circ \).

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( XY \) and \( XZ \) are midsegments, they are parallel to the sides \( ST \) and \( RT \), respectively, and half their lengths.
  - The length of \( ST \) can be determined using the properties of midsegments.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( ST \).
- Key geometric property: A midsegment of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length.
- Therefore, \( XY \parallel ST \) and \( XY = \frac{1}{2} ST \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, points, lines, and midsegments.
- Capture the relationship between midsegments and the sides of the triangle.
- Use the property that midsegments are half the length of the opposite side.
