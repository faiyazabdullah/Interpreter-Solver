REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)
  - Quadrilateral \( DEBF \)
  - Line segments \( AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FB, AG, GD \)
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \)

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( AB = x - 2 \)
  - \( BC = 5 \)
  - \( CD = 4 \)
  - \( DE = 10 \)
  - \( EF = 4 \)
  - \( FB = 5 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angles at \( \angle FDE, \angle FBC, \angle EAB, \angle GAD \)
  - Parallel lines: \( EB \parallel DC \) (as stated in the question)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Relationship:**
  - \( EB \parallel DC \) implies that quadrilateral \( DEBF \) is a parallelogram.
  - Since \( DE \parallel BF \) and \( EB \parallel DF \), opposite sides are equal: \( DE = BF \) and \( EB = DF \).

- **Right Angles:**
  - \( \angle FDE, \angle FBC, \angle EAB, \angle GAD \) are right angles.
  - This suggests several right triangles within the figure.

- **Similarity and Proportionality:**
  - Since \( EB \parallel DC \), \( \triangle AEB \sim \triangle ADC \) by AA similarity (corresponding angles are equal due to parallel lines).
  - The proportionality of corresponding sides will be used to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AB = x - 2 \)
  - \( BC = 5 \)
  - \( CD = 4 \)
  - \( DE = 10 \)
  - \( EF = 4 \)
  - \( FB = 5 \)

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \( EB \parallel DC \), the triangles \( \triangle AEB \) and \( \triangle ADC \) are similar.
  - The ratio of corresponding sides of similar triangles will be equal:
    \[
    \frac{AE}{AD} = \frac{AB}{AC}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the similarity of triangles \( \triangle AEB \) and \( \triangle ADC \).
- The key is to express the lengths of \( AE \) and \( AD \) in terms of known quantities and then set up the proportionality equation.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- The predicates should capture the similarity of triangles, parallel lines, right angles, and the given measurements.
