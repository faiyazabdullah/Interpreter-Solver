QUESTION: Find \cos C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image depicts a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The vertices are labeled as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - Side \( AB \) is labeled as 3 units.
  - Side \( BC \) is labeled as 5 units.
  - Side \( AC \) is not explicitly labeled but is part of the triangle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( A \), indicating that \( \angle BAC \) is a right angle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - Sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) are perpendicular.
  - Side \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 3 \) units.
  - \( BC = 5 \) units.
  - \( AC \) is the unknown side, which we will determine using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( \cos C \).
- To find \( \cos C \), we need:
  1. The lengths of sides \( AC \) and \( AB \).
  2. Use the definition of cosine in a right triangle: 
     \[
     \cos C = \frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{AB}{BC}.
     \]
- We already know \( AB = 3 \) and \( BC = 5 \). However, we need to verify the length of \( AC \) using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the given information and relationships in the form of predicates.
- The predicates should include:
  - The triangle and its vertices.
  - The right angle at \( A \).
  - The measurements of sides \( AB \) and \( BC \).
  - The relationship that \( BC \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The calculation of \( AC \) using the Pythagorean theorem.
