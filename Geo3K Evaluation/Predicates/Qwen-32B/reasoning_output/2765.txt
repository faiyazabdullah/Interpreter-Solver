REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains several triangles and lines.
  - Key points: \( A, B, Q, D, B', X \).
  - Triangles: \( \triangle ABQ \), \( \triangle DBB' \).
  - Lines: \( AB, BB', QB, BD, B'D \).

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( QB = 6 \).
  - \( BQ = 8 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbol at \( \angle AQB \), indicating \( \triangle ABQ \) is a right triangle.
  - Line segment \( BB' \) appears to be a scaled version of \( QB \), suggesting a dilation or similarity transformation.
  - Parallel lines are implied between \( AB \) and \( B'D \), as indicated by the parallel marking.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABQ \) is a right triangle with \( \angle AQB = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle DBB' \) shares the same orientation as \( \triangle ABQ \), suggesting similarity.
  - Line segments \( AB \) and \( B'D \) are parallel.
  - The scaling factor between \( B \) and \( B' \) needs to be determined based on the given measurements.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The right angle at \( Q \) implies specific trigonometric relationships in \( \triangle ABQ \).
  - The parallel lines and similar triangles suggest proportional relationships between corresponding sides.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( QB = 6 \).
  - \( BQ = 8 \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The length \( QB \) and \( BQ \) are given, and they form the legs of the right triangle \( \triangle ABQ \).
  - The length \( BB' \) is related to the scaling factor, which we need to determine.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks for the **scale factor** from \( B \) to \( B' \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The scale factor can be determined by comparing the lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles.
  - Since \( \triangle ABQ \) and \( \triangle DBB' \) appear similar, the ratio of corresponding sides will give the scale factor.

- **Information Needed:**
  - Lengths of corresponding sides in \( \triangle ABQ \) and \( \triangle DBB' \).
  - Specifically, the ratio \( \frac{BB'}{BQ} \) will give the scale factor.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the geometric shapes and points.
  - Specify the right angle and parallel relationships.
  - Capture the measurements and proportional relationships.
  - Ensure all visible constraints are represented.
