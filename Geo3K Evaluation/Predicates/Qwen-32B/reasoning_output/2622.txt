REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Shapes Identified**:
  - Two rhombuses are shown in the image.
  - The larger rhombus has vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D \).
  - The smaller rhombus is positioned to the right of the larger rhombus and is shaded green.

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - The larger rhombus has diagonals intersecting at point \( O \).
  - One diagonal of the larger rhombus is labeled as 8 yd.
  - The area of the larger rhombus is given as \( 36 \, \text{yd}^2 \).
  - The smaller rhombus has one diagonal labeled as 4 yd.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Both rhombuses have diagonals marked, indicating they are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
  - The smaller rhombus is shaded green, indicating it is the focus for the area calculation.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Both rhombuses are similar because their corresponding angles are equal, and their sides are proportional.
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
  - The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: 
    \[
    \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
    \]
    where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - Since the rhombuses are similar, the ratio of their corresponding diagonals is the same as the ratio of their sides.
  - The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides (or diagonals).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - Diagonal of the larger rhombus: \( d_1 = 8 \, \text{yd} \).
  - Area of the larger rhombus: \( 36 \, \text{yd}^2 \).
  - Diagonal of the smaller rhombus: \( d_1' = 4 \, \text{yd} \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - The ratio of the diagonals of the smaller rhombus to the larger rhombus is:
    \[
    \text{Ratio of diagonals} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
    \]
  - The ratio of the areas will be the square of this ratio:
    \[
    \text{Ratio of areas} = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - Find the area of the green rhombus (the smaller rhombus).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The similarity of the rhombuses and the relationship between their areas based on the ratio of their corresponding diagonals.

- **Information Needed**:
  - The area of the larger rhombus.
  - The ratio of the diagonals of the smaller rhombus to the larger rhombus.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the shapes and their properties.
  - Establish the relationship between the diagonals and areas of the rhombuses.
  - Capture the similarity and the ratio of the diagonals.
