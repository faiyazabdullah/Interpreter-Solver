================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram P Q R S to find Q P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure shows a parallelogram labeled \( P Q R S \).
  - Points \( P, Q, R, S \) are the vertices of the parallelogram.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines connecting the vertices form the sides of the parallelogram: \( PQ \), \( QR \), \( RS \), and \( SP \).

- **Angles**:
  - An angle \( \angle PQR \) is marked and its measure is given as \( 128^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The side \( RS \) is labeled as 5 units.
  - The side \( PS \) is labeled as 3 units.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings (like right angles or congruence symbols) are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( PQ = RS \) and \( QR = SP \).
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Consecutive angles are supplementary.

- **Given Information**:
  - \( RS = 5 \) implies \( PQ = 5 \) (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal).
  - \( PS = 3 \) implies \( QR = 3 \) (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - \( \angle PQR = 128^\circ \). Since \( PQRS \) is a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary:
    \[
    \angle QPS = 180^\circ - \angle PQR = 180^\circ - 128^\circ = 52^\circ.
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( RS = 5 \)
  - \( PS = 3 \)
  - \( \angle PQR = 128^\circ \)
  - Using the properties of a parallelogram, we deduce:
    - \( PQ = RS = 5 \)
    - \( QR = SP = 3 \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of \( QP \).
- From the properties of a parallelogram, we know \( QP = RS \).
- Therefore, \( QP = 5 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- The predicates will capture the shape, measurements, and relationships without directly stating the final answer.
