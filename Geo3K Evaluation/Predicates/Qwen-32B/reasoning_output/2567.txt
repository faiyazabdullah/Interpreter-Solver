REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Quadrilateral \(EFGH\) is a rectangle.
  - Diagonals \(EG\) and \(FH\) intersect at point \(K\).
  - Right angle symbol is present at \(\angle HGE\).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Lines \(EH\), \(HG\), \(GF\), and \(FE\) form the sides of the rectangle.
  - Diagonals \(EG\) and \(FH\) are drawn, intersecting at \(K\).
  - \(\angle HGE = 13^\circ\) is explicitly given.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol indicates \(\angle HGE = 90^\circ\), but the problem specifies \(\angle HGE = 13^\circ\). This suggests \(\angle HGE\) is part of a larger context involving the diagonals.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Rectangle:**
  - Opposite sides are parallel and equal: \(EH \parallel FG\) and \(EF \parallel HG\).
  - All interior angles are right angles: \(\angle EHG = \angle HGF = \angle GFE = \angle FHE = 90^\circ\).
  - Diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other: \(EG = FH\) and \(EK = KG\), \(FK = KH\).

- **Diagonals and Angles:**
  - The diagonals \(EG\) and \(FH\) intersect at \(K\), dividing each other into two equal segments.
  - Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement:**
  - \(\angle HGE = 13^\circ\).

- **Implications:**
  - Since \(EFGH\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(EG\) and \(FH\) are congruent and bisect each other.
  - The intersection point \(K\) divides the diagonals into equal segments, and the diagonals are symmetric with respect to the rectangle's center.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Find the measure of \(\angle FGE\).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - In a rectangle, the diagonals are congruent and bisect each other.
  - The diagonals of a rectangle form isosceles triangles with the sides of the rectangle.
  - The sum of angles around point \(G\) is \(360^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Shapes and Points:**
  - Define the rectangle and its vertices.
  - Define the diagonals and their intersection point.

- **Predicates for Angles and Measurements:**
  - Specify the given angle \(\angle HGE = 13^\circ\).
  - Use properties of rectangles and isosceles triangles formed by the diagonals.

- **Predicates for Relationships:**
  - Capture the relationships between the diagonals and the sides of the rectangle.
  - Ensure all geometric constraints are represented.
