================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure is a parallelogram with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - There is a vertical dashed line from point \( A \) to side \( DC \), labeled as the height of the parallelogram.
  - The parallelogram is shaded blue, indicating the region of interest.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - The base \( DC \) has a length of 21 cm.
  - The slanted side \( AC \) has a length of 17 cm.
  - The height from \( A \) to \( DC \) is labeled as 8 cm.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The dashed line from \( A \) to \( DC \) is perpendicular to \( DC \), indicating it is the height of the parallelogram.
  - No other specific angle markings are present, but the perpendicularity ensures the height is correctly aligned.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The figure is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are equal and parallel:
    - \( AB \parallel DC \) and \( AD \parallel BC \).
  - The height is perpendicular to the base, forming a right angle:
    - \( \text{Height} \perp DC \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The height is explicitly given as 8 cm, and it is perpendicular to the base \( DC \).
  - The base \( DC \) is 21 cm, and the slanted side \( AC \) is 17 cm, but these are not directly used in calculating the area.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Base of the parallelogram (\( DC \)): 21 cm.
  - Height of the parallelogram: 8 cm.
  - Slanted side (\( AC \)): 17 cm (not directly relevant for area calculation).

- **Measurement Relationships:**
  - The area of a parallelogram is calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
    \]
  - Here, the base is 21 cm and the height is 8 cm.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The area of a parallelogram depends on its base and height.
  - The height is already given as 8 cm, and the base is given as 21 cm.
- **Information Needed:**
  - The base and height are sufficient to calculate the area. No additional derivations are required.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the parallelogram and its properties.
  - Indicate the base and height measurements.
  - Capture the perpendicular relationship between the height and the base.
