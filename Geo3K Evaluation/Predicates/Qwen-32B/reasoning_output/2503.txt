REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle with center \( O \).
  - A chord \( AB \) passing through the circle.
  - A point \( E \) on the circumference of the circle.
  - A shaded region within the circle, bounded by the arc \( AE \) and the chord \( AB \).

- **Points:**
  - \( A \), \( B \), \( E \), and \( O \) are labeled points.
  - \( O \) is the center of the circle.

- **Lines and Chords:**
  - \( AB \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( OE \) is a radius of the circle.

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BOE = 30^\circ \) is explicitly marked.

- **Measurements:**
  - The radius \( OE \) is labeled as 5 units.

- **Shading:**
  - The region bounded by the arc \( AE \) and the chord \( AB \) is shaded.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships:**
  - \( O \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( OE \) and \( OB \) are radii of the circle, so \( OE = OB = 5 \).
  - \( \angle BOE = 30^\circ \) is a central angle subtending the arc \( BE \).
  - The shaded region is a segment of the circle, consisting of a sector minus a triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Radius \( OE = 5 \) units.
  - Central angle \( \angle BOE = 30^\circ \).

- **Implications:**
  - The area of the sector can be calculated using the formula for the area of a sector: \( \text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 \), where \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and \( r = 5 \).
  - The area of the triangle \( \triangle BOE \) can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle: \( \text{Area of } \triangle BOE = \frac{1}{2} \times OB \times OE \times \sin(\angle BOE) \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:** Find the area of the shaded region.
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The shaded region is a circular segment, which is the difference between the area of the sector \( BOE \) and the area of the triangle \( \triangle BOE \).
  - The area of the shaded region is given by:
    \[
    \text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of sector} - \text{Area of } \triangle BOE
    \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle, its center, and radius.
  - Define the points and lines forming the sector and triangle.
  - Specify the central angle and radius measurements.
  - Indicate the shaded region as the difference between the sector and triangle.
