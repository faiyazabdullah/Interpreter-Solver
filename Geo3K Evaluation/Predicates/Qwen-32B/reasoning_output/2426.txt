REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Shapes**: 
  - Two rectangles are shown.
  - The left rectangle has dimensions labeled as one side being 4 inches.
  - The right rectangle has dimensions labeled as one side being \( x \) inches and the area given as 32 square inches.

- **Labels and Measurements**:
  - Left rectangle:
    - One side is labeled as 4 inches.
    - The area is given as 8 square inches.
  - Right rectangle:
    - One side is labeled as \( x \) inches.
    - The area is given as 32 square inches.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Both rectangles appear to have right angles, indicating they are indeed rectangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Both figures are rectangles, meaning they have four right angles and opposite sides are equal.
  - The two rectangles are similar because their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - Left rectangle:
    - One side = 4 inches.
    - Area = 8 square inches.
  - Right rectangle:
    - One side = \( x \) inches.
    - Area = 32 square inches.

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - For the left rectangle, if one side is 4 inches and the area is 8 square inches, we can calculate the other side.
  - For the right rectangle, we know the area is 32 square inches and one side is \( x \). We need to find the other side and use similarity to relate it to the left rectangle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \) for the right rectangle.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The areas of similar figures are related by the square of the scale factor of their corresponding sides.
  - The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the rectangles and their dimensions.
  - Capture the area relationships and similarity.
  - Use the given areas and side lengths to establish the necessary relationships.
