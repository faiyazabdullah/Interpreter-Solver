REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a circle centered at point \( G \).
  - There are several points on the circumference: \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
  - Two chords are highlighted: \( AC \) and \( DF \).
  - The center of the circle is labeled \( G \).

- **Lines and Chords**:
  - Chord \( AC \) connects points \( A \) and \( C \).
  - Chord \( DF \) connects points \( D \) and \( F \).

- **Measurements and Annotations**:
  - The radius of the circle is given as 26.
  - The distance from the center \( G \) to the chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) is marked as 10.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The perpendicular distances from the center \( G \) to the chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are explicitly shown and equal to 10.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements**:
  - Both chords \( AC \) and \( DF \) are equidistant from the center \( G \).
  - The perpendicular distances from the center \( G \) to the chords are equal, indicating symmetry in their positioning relative to the center.
  - The radius of the circle is the hypotenuse of the right triangles formed by the perpendicular from the center to the chords and half the length of each chord.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord.
  - The radius, the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, and half the chord form a right triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - Radius of the circle: \( 26 \).
  - Perpendicular distance from the center \( G \) to both chords \( AC \) and \( DF \): \( 10 \).

- **Interpretation**:
  - The perpendicular from the center to a chord splits the chord into two equal segments.
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can relate the radius, the perpendicular distance, and half the chord length.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks for the length of chord \( AC \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The radius, perpendicular distance, and half the chord form a right triangle.
  - The relationship can be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem.

- **Information Needed**:
  - The radius of the circle (\( 26 \)).
  - The perpendicular distance from the center to the chord (\( 10 \)).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the circle, its center, and radius.
  - Represent the chords and their relationship to the center.
  - Capture the perpendicular distances and the right triangles formed.
  - Ensure all geometric relationships are atomic and clear.
