### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram shows a circle centered at point \( M \).
  - Points \( F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( FL \), \( HJ \), \( HP \), and \( PJ \) are chords of the circle.
  
- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - \( FL = 24 \)
  - \( HJ = 48 \)
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - Two right angle symbols are shown at points \( L \) and \( N \), indicating that the radii \( ML \) and \( MN \) form right angles with the respective chords \( FL \) and \( PJ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circles and Chords**:
  - \( FL \), \( HJ \), \( HP \), and \( PJ \) are chords of the circle.
  - The center \( M \) is equidistant from all points on the circumference.
  - The radii \( ML \) and \( MN \) are perpendicular to the chords \( FL \) and \( PJ \), respectively, since they intersect the chords at their midpoints (a property of circles).

- **Angles**:
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \) is given.
  - Since \( M \) is the center, the measure of the arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is twice the central angle subtended by it.

- **Chord Lengths**:
  - \( FL = 24 \) and \( HJ = 48 \) are given, but their specific positions relative to the arc \( \widehat{PJ} \) need further analysis.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Arc Measures**:
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \) is explicitly given.
  - We need to determine \( m\widehat{PJ} \).

- **Chord Properties**:
  - The perpendicularity of the radii to the chords indicates that the chords are bisected by the radii.
  - This property helps in understanding the symmetry and distribution of the arcs.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\widehat{PJ} \).
- To find \( m\widehat{PJ} \), we need to use the given information about the circle, the arc measures, and the symmetry of the circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will include the circle, its center, points on the circumference, chords, radii, and the given arc measure.
