================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present with center \( O \).
  - Several points are marked on the circumference: \( A, B, C, D, E, G \).
  - Line segments connect these points, forming various triangles and chords.

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - \( AB \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( CD \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( CE \) is a line segment inside the circle.
  - \( BG \) is a line segment.
  - \( AG \) is a line segment.

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CGE \) is a right angle (marked with a red right-angle symbol).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right-angle symbol indicates \( \angle CGE = 90^\circ \).
  - No additional parallel, perpendicular, or congruence markings are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Cyclic Quadrilateral:**
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E \) lie on the circumference of the circle, forming a cyclic quadrilateral.
  
- **Central and Inscribed Angles:**
  - \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( CB \).
  - The central angle subtended by the same arc \( CB \) would be twice the measure of the inscribed angle.

- **Right Triangle:**
  - \( \angle CGE = 90^\circ \) forms a right triangle \( CGE \).

- **Intersections and Collinearity:**
  - \( G \) is the intersection point of chords \( AB \) and \( CD \).
  - \( E \) lies on the extension of \( CD \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CGE = 90^\circ \).

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \), the central angle subtending arc \( CB \) is \( 2 \times 60^\circ = 120^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CGE = 90^\circ \) confirms \( \triangle CGE \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:** Find \( m\angle BGE \).
- **Relevant Information:**
  - \( \angle CGE = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \) helps determine the cyclic properties and relationships.
  - \( G \) is the intersection of chords \( AB \) and \( CD \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Define the circle, points, and lines.
  
- **Predicates for Angles and Measurements:**
  - Capture the given angles and their relationships.
  
- **Predicates for Relationships:**
  - Use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and right triangles.
