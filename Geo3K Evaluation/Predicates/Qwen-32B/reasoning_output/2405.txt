REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains labeled points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I \).
- **Lines**: Two parallel lines are labeled \( \ell \) and \( m \). Additional lines include \( AB, BC, CG, HI, EF, \) and others.
- **Angles**: 
  - \( \angle BAC \) is marked as \( 38^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BCA \) is marked as \( 33^\circ \).
- **Parallel Lines**: Lines \( \ell \) and \( m \) are explicitly marked as parallel.
- **Intersections**: 
  - Line \( AB \) intersects line \( \ell \) at point \( A \).
  - Line \( BC \) intersects line \( m \) at point \( C \).
  - Line \( CG \) intersects both \( \ell \) and \( m \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelism**: 
  - Lines \( \ell \) and \( m \) are parallel.
  - Since \( \ell \parallel m \), corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and alternate exterior angles formed by transversals are equal.
- **Transversals**: 
  - Line \( AB \) acts as a transversal to the parallel lines \( \ell \) and \( m \).
  - Line \( CG \) also acts as a transversal to the parallel lines \( \ell \) and \( m \).
- **Triangles**: 
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is formed by points \( A, B, \) and \( C \).
  - Angles within \( \triangle ABC \) are related by the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**: 
  - \( \angle BAC = 38^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BCA = 33^\circ \).
- **Unknown Angle**: 
  - The measure of \( \angle ABC \) is to be determined.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle ABC \).
- To find \( \angle ABC \), we use the property that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle BAC + \angle BCA + \angle ABC = 180^\circ.
  \]
- Substituting the given values:
  \[
  38^\circ + 33^\circ + \angle ABC = 180^\circ.
  \]
- Solving for \( \angle ABC \):
  \[
  \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 38^\circ - 33^\circ = 109^\circ.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram using atomic predicates.
- Predicates should capture the parallelism of lines, the angles within \( \triangle ABC \), and the relationships between the lines and points.
