REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - The quadrilateral is labeled as a parallelogram (\(ABCD\)).
  - There are additional points \(F\) inside the parallelogram, where diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(F\).
  - Sides of the parallelogram are labeled with expressions involving variables:
    - \(AD = 13\)
    - \(DC = 10\)
    - \(BC = 2x + 7\)
    - \(AB = 3y - 8\)
  
- **Angles:**
  - Angles are labeled at specific vertices:
    - \(\angle DAB = 59^\circ\)
    - \(\angle ABC = 20^\circ\)
    - \(\angle BFC = 49^\circ\) (at the intersection of diagonals).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Parallelogram:**
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Consecutive angles are supplementary.
  - Diagonals bisect each other.

- **Given Constraints:**
  - The lengths of sides are expressed in terms of variables.
  - Specific angle measures are provided.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Expressions:**
  - \(AD = 13\)
  - \(DC = 10\)
  - \(BC = 2x + 7\)
  - \(AB = 3y - 8\)
  - \(\angle DAB = 59^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ABC = 20^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BFC = 49^\circ\)

- **Relationships:**
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram:
    - \(AB = DC = 10\)
    - \(AD = BC = 13\)
  - Using these, we can solve for \(x\) and \(y\):
    - From \(AB = 10\): \(3y - 8 = 10\)
    - From \(BC = 13\): \(2x + 7 = 13\)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle ACD\).
- In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary.
- We know \(\angle DAB = 59^\circ\). Since \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle BCD\) are opposite angles:
  - \(\angle BCD = 59^\circ\).
- To find \(\angle ACD\), we use the fact that \(\angle ACD\) and \(\angle BCD\) are part of the same linear pair formed by diagonal \(AC\):
  - \(\angle ACD = 180^\circ - \angle BCD\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the shape, angles, side lengths, and relationships without directly solving for the final answer.
