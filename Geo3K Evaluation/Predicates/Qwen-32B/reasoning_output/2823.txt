REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - There is a circle with center \( U \).
  - Two tangents to the circle are drawn from point \( V \) and point \( T \). These tangents touch the circle at points \( B \) and \( T \), respectively.
  - A triangle \( VBT \) is formed by connecting points \( V \), \( B \), and \( T \).

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - The length of the tangent segment from \( V \) to \( B \) is given as 7 units.
  - The length of the tangent segment from \( T \) to the point of tangency (which is \( T \) itself since it is on the circle) is given as 11 units.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The segments \( VB \) and \( VT \) are tangent to the circle at points \( B \) and \( T \), respectively.
  - The lengths of the tangents from a common external point to a circle are equal if they are drawn to the same circle.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since \( VB \) and \( VT \) are tangents to the circle from the same external point \( V \), the lengths of the tangents from \( V \) to the points of tangency \( B \) and \( T \) are equal.
  - However, in this case, the lengths are given differently (7 and 11), suggesting that \( T \) is directly on the circle, and the tangent length from \( T \) to itself is effectively zero in terms of additional extension.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The key property of tangents is that the length of the tangent segment from an external point to the point of tangency is equal if drawn from the same external point.
  - Here, \( VB = 7 \) and the effective tangent length from \( T \) is 11, but \( T \) is already on the circle, so we focus on the triangle \( VBT \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( VB = 7 \)
  - \( VT = 11 \) (effective tangent length from \( T \) to the circle).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( T \) is on the circle, the length \( VT \) is effectively the straight-line distance from \( V \) to \( T \), which is part of the triangle \( VBT \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks us to find the length of \( x \), which represents the side \( BT \) of the triangle \( VBT \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem or the properties of tangents can be used to solve for \( x \). However, since \( T \) is on the circle and the tangents are given, we use the fact that the lengths of tangents from a point to a circle are equal if extended properly.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the points, lines, and circle.
  - Establish the tangency relationships.
  - Use the given measurements.
  - Represent the triangle and its sides.
