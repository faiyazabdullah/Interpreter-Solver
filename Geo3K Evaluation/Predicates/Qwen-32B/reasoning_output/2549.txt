STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2549
================================================================================
QUESTION: If A E = m - 2, E C = m + 4, A D = 4, and A B = 20, find m.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \).
- **Lines**: Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), \( AC \), \( AD \), \( DE \), and \( EC \) are visible.
- **Angles**: 
  - A right angle is marked at \( \angle ADE \) and \( \angle DEC \).
  - Another angle is marked at \( \angle BAC \).
- **Special Markings**:
  - \( DE \) is marked as perpendicular to \( AC \).
  - No parallel lines or additional congruence markings are evident.
- **Measurements**:
  - \( AE = m - 2 \)
  - \( EC = m + 4 \)
  - \( AD = 4 \)
  - \( AB = 20 \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Right Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle ADE \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ADE = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle DEC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle DEC = 90^\circ \).
- **Line Segments**:
  - \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AC \), making \( DE \) an altitude of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( AE \) and \( EC \) are segments of \( AC \), so \( AC = AE + EC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given:
  - \( AE = m - 2 \)
  - \( EC = m + 4 \)
  - \( AD = 4 \)
  - \( AB = 20 \)
- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( DE \) is perpendicular to \( AC \), \( DE \) divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two smaller right triangles.
  - The total length of \( AC \) is the sum of \( AE \) and \( EC \):
    \[
    AC = AE + EC = (m - 2) + (m + 4) = 2m + 2
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks us to find the value of \( m \).
- To solve for \( m \), we need to use the given measurements and relationships:
  - The total length of \( AC \) is \( 2m + 2 \).
  - We need to establish a relationship involving \( AB \), \( AD \), and the segments \( AE \) and \( EC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will include:
  - Shapes (triangles, lines).
  - Angles and their properties.
  - Line segment lengths and their relationships.
  - Perpendicular relationships.
