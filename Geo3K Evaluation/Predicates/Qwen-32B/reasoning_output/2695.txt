### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements**:
  - A circle is present with center \( N \).
  - Two tangents are drawn to the circle from an external point \( L \): one tangent at point \( M \) and another tangent at point \( P \).
  - Points \( M \), \( L \), and \( P \) lie on the tangents.
  - Points \( M \), \( N \), and \( P \) form an arc on the circle.
  
- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - The angle \( \angle MNL \) is labeled as \( 36^\circ \).
  - The angle \( \angle NLP \) is labeled as \( 78^\circ \).
  - The tangents \( LM \) and \( LP \) are perpendicular to the radii \( NM \) and \( NP \) respectively, indicated by the right-angle symbols.
  
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols indicate that \( NM \perp ML \) and \( NP \perp LP \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( NM \) and \( NP \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( LM \) and \( LP \) are tangents to the circle at points \( M \) and \( P \) respectively.
  - The radii \( NM \) and \( NP \) are perpendicular to the respective tangents \( LM \) and \( LP \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{MP} \) is subtended by the central angle \( \angle MNP \).
  - The sum of the angles around point \( N \) must equal \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle MNL = 36^\circ \)
  - \( \angle NLP = 78^\circ \)
  
- **Implications**:
  - Since \( NM \perp ML \) and \( NP \perp LP \), the angles \( \angle NML \) and \( \angle NPL \) are both \( 90^\circ \).
  - The central angle \( \angle MNP \) can be calculated using the fact that the sum of angles around point \( N \) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**:
  - Find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{LP} \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its corresponding central angle.
  - The central angle \( \angle MNP \) can be determined by analyzing the angles around point \( N \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the circle, points, and lines.
  - Indicate the perpendicularity of tangents to radii.
  - Specify the given angles and their relationships.
  - Represent the central angle \( \angle MNP \) and its relationship to the arc \( \widehat{LP} \).
