STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2452
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 58, m \angle 2 = 47, and m \angle 3 = 26. Find the measure of \angle 5.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( A, B, C, D, E \).
- **Lines**: There are several line segments connecting these points:
  - \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( DA \), \( BE \), \( EC \), and \( ED \).
- **Angles**: Several angles are labeled:
  - \( \angle 1 \) at point \( A \), \( \angle 2 \) at point \( B \), \( \angle 3 \) at point \( C \), and \( \angle 5 \) at point \( E \).
- **Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle 1 = 58^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 2 = 47^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \)
- **Special Markings**:
  - There are no explicit markings for parallel, perpendicular, or congruent lines. However, the diagram suggests that \( BE \) intersects \( AC \) at point \( E \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Shapes**:
  - The quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is formed by the points \( A, B, C, D \).
  - The triangle \( BCE \) is formed by the points \( B, C, E \).
- **Relationships**:
  - \( BE \) is a line segment intersecting \( AC \) at point \( E \).
  - \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3 \) are exterior angles relative to the intersections and internal angles of the triangles and quadrilateral.
  - \( \angle 5 \) is an interior angle of triangle \( BCE \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The given measurements are:
  - \( m\angle 1 = 58^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 2 = 47^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \)
- These angles are part of the larger geometric structure, and their relationships will help determine \( m\angle 5 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 5 \).
- To find \( m\angle 5 \), we need to use the properties of angles in a triangle and the relationships between the given angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the structure of the quadrilateral \( ABCD \), the triangle \( BCE \), and the relationships between the angles.
