REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure contains a circle with center \( O \).
  - There are two tangents to the circle: one from point \( B \) and another from point \( E \).
  - Points \( A \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( G \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Points \( B \) and \( E \) lie outside the circle, connected to the tangents.

- **Lines and Tangents**:
  - Lines \( AB \) and \( BE \) are tangent to the circle at points \( A \) and \( E \), respectively.
  - Line segments \( BD \) and \( DG \) form part of the circle's circumference.

- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - The angle \( \angle ACD \) is labeled as \( 50^\circ \).
  - The angle at point \( B \) is labeled as \( (x + 2.5)^\circ \).
  - The angle at point \( E \) is labeled as \( (4x + 5)^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The tangents from a single external point to a circle are equal in length and make equal angles with the line joining the external point to the circle's center.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Tangents and Circle**:
  - Since \( AB \) and \( BE \) are tangents to the circle, the radii \( OA \) and \( OE \) are perpendicular to the tangents at the points of contact.
  - The angles formed by the tangents and the radii at the points of contact are right angles:
    - \( \angle OAB = 90^\circ \)
    - \( \angle OEB = 90^\circ \)

- **Central Angles and Inscribed Angles**:
  - The inscribed angle \( \angle ACD \) intercepts the arc \( AD \). The measure of the central angle \( \angle AOD \) that intercepts the same arc is twice the measure of the inscribed angle:
    \[
    \text{Measure of } \angle AOD = 2 \times \text{Measure of } \angle ACD = 2 \times 50^\circ = 100^\circ.
    \]

- **Exterior Angles**:
  - The angles at points \( B \) and \( E \) are exterior angles formed by the tangents and the secant \( DE \).
  - By the property of tangents, the angles formed by the tangents and the line joining the external point to the center of the circle are equal. Thus:
    - \( \angle BOE = 180^\circ - 2 \times \text{(angle at } B \text{)} \)
    - \( \angle BOE = 180^\circ - 2 \times (x + 2.5) \)
    - Similarly, \( \angle BOE = 180^\circ - 2 \times (4x + 5) \)

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle ACD = 50^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = (x + 2.5)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle E = (4x + 5)^\circ \)

- **Relationships**:
  - The angles at points \( B \) and \( E \) are related through the circle's properties and the tangents.
  - The sum of the angles around point \( O \) (the center of the circle) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we need to use the relationships between the angles formed by the tangents and the circle's center.
- Specifically, the angles at points \( B \) and \( E \) are related to the central angle \( \angle BOE \), which can be expressed in terms of \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements using predicates.
- The key relationships involve the tangents, the central angle, and the inscribed angle.
- Predicates will capture the tangency, angle measures, and the relationship between the angles at points \( B \) and \( E \).
