REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle centered at \( M \) with radius \( r \).
  - Points \( F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( FL, HJ, NJ \) are chords of the circle.
  - \( M \) is the center of the circle.
  - Right angles are marked at \( L \) and \( N \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( FL = 24 \).
  - \( HJ = 48 \).
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angles at \( L \) and \( N \) indicate that \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are perpendicular to some radii from \( M \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is explicitly mentioned with a measure of \( 65^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements:**
  - \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are chords of the circle.
  - Since \( FL \) and \( HJ \) form right angles with radii at \( L \) and \( N \), respectively, they are diameters of smaller circles inscribed within the larger circle.
  - \( NJ \) is another chord of the circle.
  - The arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is subtended by the chord \( HP \), and its measure is given as \( 65^\circ \).

- **Implied Properties:**
  - The right angles at \( L \) and \( N \) imply that \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are diameters of smaller circles whose centers lie on the radii from \( M \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{HP} \) indicates that \( \angle HMP = 65^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( FL = 24 \): This is the length of a chord that forms a right angle with a radius.
  - \( HJ = 48 \): This is the length of another chord forming a right angle with a radius.
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \): This is the measure of the arc subtended by the chord \( HP \).

- **What These Measurements Represent:**
  - \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are related to the radius of the circle through the Pythagorean theorem since they form right triangles with radii.
  - The arc \( \widehat{HP} \) helps determine the central angle subtended by \( HP \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the length of \( NJ \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The length of a chord in a circle can be determined using the formula involving the radius and the central angle subtended by the chord.
  - The right angles at \( L \) and \( N \) suggest that \( FL \) and \( HJ \) are diameters of smaller circles, which simplifies the problem.

- **Information Needed:**
  - The radius \( r \) of the circle.
  - The central angle subtended by the chord \( NJ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify the points and lines (chords).
  - Indicate the right angles and their implications.
  - Include the given measurements and arc measures.
  - Ensure all relationships and constraints are captured.
