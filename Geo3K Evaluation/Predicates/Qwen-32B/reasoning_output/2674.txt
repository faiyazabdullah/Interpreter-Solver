================================================================================

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle with center \( F \) is shown.
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Line segments \( AB, CD, EF \) are chords of the circle.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - \( CF \) is drawn perpendicular to \( FB \), indicated by the right angle symbol at \( F \).
  - \( \angle DFA = 50^\circ \) is explicitly labeled.
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - \( CF \perp FB \) indicates a right angle.
  - \( \angle DFA = 50^\circ \) is a central angle subtended by arc \( DA \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - \( F \) is the center of the circle.
  - Chords \( AB, CD, EF \) are equidistant from the center if they are equal in length.
  - Central angles subtend arcs on the circle.
  
- **Perpendicularity:**
  - \( CF \perp FB \) implies that \( \angle CFB = 90^\circ \).
  
- **Central Angles and Arcs:**
  - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.
  - \( \angle DFA = 50^\circ \) subtends arc \( DA \), so \( m\widehat{DA} = 50^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( m\angle DFA = 50^\circ \).
  - \( CF \perp FB \), so \( \angle CFB = 90^\circ \).
  
- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \( \angle DFA \) is a central angle, \( m\widehat{DA} = 50^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CFB = 90^\circ \) implies that arc \( CB \) spans \( 180^\circ \) because \( CF \) and \( FB \) form a semicircle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - Find \( m\widehat{ACE} \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an arc is determined by its central angle.
  - The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Arc \( ACE \) can be calculated by considering the remaining arcs after subtracting known arcs.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify the points on the circle.
  - Indicate perpendicularity and central angles.
  - Use arc measures derived from central angles.
  
- **Key Relationships to Capture:**
  - \( F \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( \angle DFA = 50^\circ \) subtends arc \( DA \).
  - \( CF \perp FB \) forms a right angle.
  - Use the total circle measure to find \( m\widehat{ACE} \).
