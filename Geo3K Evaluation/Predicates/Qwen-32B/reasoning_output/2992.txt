REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains multiple labeled points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.
- **Lines and Segments**: 
  - Lines AE, BF, CH, DJ, and EI are drawn.
  - Line segments appear to be tangents to a circle.
- **Angles**: 
  - An angle labeled \(85^\circ\) is subtended by arc FG.
  - Another angle labeled \(230^\circ\) is subtended by arc GH.
- **Circle**: 
  - A circle is centered at point O (not explicitly labeled but implied).
  - Points F, G, H, and I lie on the circumference of the circle.
- **Tangents**: 
  - Lines AE, BF, CH, and DJ appear to be tangent to the circle at points F, G, H, and I, respectively.
- **Labels**: 
  - Angle 2 is subtended by arc HI at the center of the circle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Tangent Properties**: 
  - Since lines AE, BF, CH, and DJ are tangent to the circle, they form right angles with the radii at the points of tangency.
  - Radii OF, OG, OH, and OI are perpendicular to the respective tangent lines.
- **Central Angles**: 
  - The central angles subtended by arcs FG, GH, and HI are related to the given arc measures.
  - The total central angle around the circle is \(360^\circ\).
- **Arc Measures**: 
  - Arc FG subtends \(85^\circ\).
  - Arc GH subtends \(230^\circ\).
  - Arc HI subtends the remaining angle, which we need to calculate.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**: 
  - Arc FG measures \(85^\circ\).
  - Arc GH measures \(230^\circ\).
- **Derived Measurements**: 
  - The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\).
  - Arc HI can be calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Measure of Arc HI} = 360^\circ - (\text{Measure of Arc FG} + \text{Measure of Arc GH}) = 360^\circ - (85^\circ + 230^\circ) = 45^\circ.
    \]
  - Therefore, the central angle subtended by arc HI (which is angle 2) is \(45^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 2\).
- From the analysis, \(\angle 2\) is the central angle subtended by arc HI.
- The measure of arc HI is \(45^\circ\), so \(\angle 2 = 45^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements visible in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the tangency, central angles, arc measures, and the relationships between the elements.
