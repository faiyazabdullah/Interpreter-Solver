REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Triangle \( \triangle LMN \) with vertices \( L, M, N \).
  - Triangle \( \triangle MKP \) with vertices \( M, K, P \).
  - Triangle \( \triangle MLR \) with vertices \( M, L, R \).
  - Line segments: \( LN, NK, MP, KP, RM, LR, MQ, QP \).
  - Points: \( L, M, N, K, P, R, Q \).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Line \( P R \) is parallel to line \( K L \): \( PR \parallel KL \).
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle NMK \) and \( \angle LNK \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols at \( \angle NMK \) and \( \angle LNK \).
  - Parallel lines indicated by \( PR \parallel KL \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( KN = 9 \).
  - \( LN = 16 \).
  - \( PM = 2KP \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Relationship:**
  - Since \( PR \parallel KL \), triangles \( \triangle MLR \) and \( \triangle MKP \) are similar by AA similarity (both have right angles and share \( \angle LMR \)).
  
- **Right Triangles:**
  - \( \triangle LNK \) and \( \triangle NMK \) are right triangles.
  
- **Proportional Segments:**
  - Since \( PR \parallel KL \), the segments \( KP \) and \( PL \) are proportional to \( KM \) and \( ML \), respectively.
  
- **Similarity and Proportionality:**
  - By similarity of triangles \( \triangle MLR \) and \( \triangle MKP \), the corresponding sides are proportional.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( KN = 9 \).
  - \( LN = 16 \).
  - \( PM = 2KP \).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \( PR \parallel KL \), the triangles \( \triangle MLR \) and \( \triangle MKP \) are similar.
  - Using the similarity ratio, we can express the lengths of segments in terms of each other.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( KM \).
- To find \( KM \), we need to use the given relationships and the similarity of triangles.
- Key steps involve:
  1. Using the similarity of triangles to set up proportions.
  2. Expressing \( PM \) in terms of \( KP \) and solving for \( KM \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will include:
  - Definitions of points, lines, and triangles.
  - Right angles and parallel lines.
  - Given measurements.
  - Similarity relationships.
  - Proportional segments.
