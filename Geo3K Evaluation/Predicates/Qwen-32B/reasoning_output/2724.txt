### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Two triangles are shown: \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle QRS \).
  - Points labeled: \( L, M, N, Q, R, S \).

- **Lines and Sides**:
  - \( \triangle LMN \):
    - Side \( LM \) has length \( 2x + 11 \).
    - Side \( MN \) is unlabeled.
    - Side \( LN \) is unlabeled.
  - \( \triangle QRS \):
    - Side \( QS \) has length \( 3x - 9 \).
    - Side \( SR \) is unlabeled.
    - Side \( QR \) has length \( 2y - 40 \).

- **Angles**:
  - In \( \triangle LMN \):
    - \( \angle L \) is a right angle (marked with a right angle symbol).
    - \( \angle M \) is labeled as \( (y + 10)^\circ \).
    - \( \angle N \) is unlabeled.
  - In \( \triangle QRS \):
    - \( \angle Q \) is a right angle (marked with a right angle symbol).
    - \( \angle S \) is unlabeled.
    - \( \angle R \) is unlabeled.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Both triangles have right angles at \( L \) and \( Q \), respectively.
  - No explicit congruence or similarity markings are shown, but the problem states \( \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruence**:
  - \( \triangle LMN \cong \triangle QRS \) implies that corresponding sides and angles are equal.
  - Corresponding sides: \( LM \cong QS \), \( MN \cong SR \), \( LN \cong QR \).
  - Corresponding angles: \( \angle L \cong \angle Q \), \( \angle M \cong \angle S \), \( \angle N \cong \angle R \).

- **Right Triangles**:
  - Both triangles are right triangles, so the Pythagorean theorem applies if necessary.

- **Corresponding Angles**:
  - Since \( \angle L \) and \( \angle Q \) are both right angles, \( \angle M \) corresponds to \( \angle S \) and \( \angle N \) corresponds to \( \angle R \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Side \( LM \): \( 2x + 11 \).
  - Side \( QS \): \( 3x - 9 \).
  - Side \( QR \): \( 2y - 40 \).
  - Angle \( \angle M \): \( y + 10 \) degrees.

- **Relationships**:
  - Since the triangles are congruent, corresponding sides are equal:
    - \( LM = QS \).
    - \( MN = SR \).
    - \( LN = QR \).
  - Corresponding angles are also equal:
    - \( \angle M = \angle S \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the fact that corresponding sides of congruent triangles are equal:
  - \( LM = QS \).
  - This gives us the equation: \( 2x + 11 = 3x - 9 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using predicates.
- Predicates will include:
  - Geometric shapes and their properties.
  - Corresponding sides and angles of congruent triangles.
  - Numerical relationships between side lengths.
