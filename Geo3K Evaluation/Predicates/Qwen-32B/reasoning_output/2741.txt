REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - An equilateral pentagon \( PQRST \) is inscribed in a circle centered at \( U \).
  - The pentagon has vertices labeled \( P, Q, R, S, T \).
  - The circle is denoted as \( \odot U \).

- **Lines:**
  - The sides of the pentagon are \( PQ, QR, RS, ST, TP \).
  - These sides are chords of the circle \( \odot U \).

- **Angles:**
  - The interior angles of the pentagon are not explicitly marked, but we know the pentagon is equilateral.
  - The central angles subtended by the chords are equal since the pentagon is regular.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The pentagon is equilateral, implying all sides are equal.
  - The circle is circumscribed around the pentagon.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements:**
  - The pentagon \( PQRST \) is equilateral, so all its sides are congruent: \( PQ = QR = RS = ST = TP \).
  - The pentagon is inscribed in the circle \( \odot U \), meaning all vertices \( P, Q, R, S, T \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The center \( U \) of the circle is also the circumcenter of the pentagon.
  - The central angles subtended by the sides of the pentagon (e.g., \( \angle PUS, \angle QUR, \angle RUT, \angle SUT, \angle TUP \)) are all equal because the pentagon is regular.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - No explicit numerical values for lengths or angles are given in the diagram.
  - However, we know the properties of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle:
    - Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is \( 108^\circ \).
    - Each central angle subtended by a side of the pentagon is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - We need to find the measure of \( \angle PSR \).
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - Since \( PQRST \) is a regular pentagon, the measure of each interior angle is \( 108^\circ \).
  - The angle \( \angle PSR \) is an exterior angle formed by extending one side of the pentagon.
  - In a regular pentagon, the measure of an exterior angle subtended by two non-adjacent vertices (like \( P \) and \( R \)) can be calculated using the central angles and properties of cyclic polygons.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the pentagon, circle, and their relationships.
  - Capture the equilateral and regular properties of the pentagon.
  - Represent the inscribed nature of the pentagon in the circle.
  - Include relationships between the angles and sides.
