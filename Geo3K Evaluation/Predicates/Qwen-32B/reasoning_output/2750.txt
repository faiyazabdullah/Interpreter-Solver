REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains multiple geometric shapes including triangles, parallelograms, and a composite figure.
  - Key points are labeled: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \).
  - The overall figure appears to be a combination of several triangles and parallelograms.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( EC = 14 \) ft.
  - The vertical distance from \( E \) to \( A \) is 9 ft.
  - Several right angle symbols indicate perpendicularity at various points.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Red arrows indicate equal lengths along certain segments.
  - Right angle symbols are present at several intersections.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Shapes and Relationships:**
  - The figure appears to be composed of two larger triangles (\( \triangle AEC \) and \( \triangle ABF \)) and several smaller triangles and parallelograms within them.
  - The red arrows suggest symmetry and equal lengths in some segments.
  - The right angles indicate perpendicularity, which helps in identifying right triangles and parallelograms.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - \( \triangle AEC \) and \( \triangle ABF \) are likely similar or related in structure.
  - The vertical line segment \( EA \) is perpendicular to the horizontal base \( EC \).
  - The parallelograms and smaller triangles are nested within the larger triangles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( EC = 14 \) ft.
  - \( EA = 9 \) ft.
  - These measurements will be used to calculate areas of triangles and parallelograms.

- **Measurement Interpretation:**
  - \( EC \) serves as the base of \( \triangle AEC \).
  - \( EA \) serves as the height of \( \triangle AEC \).
  - Other dimensions can be inferred using symmetry and right-angle properties.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Task:**
  - Find the total area of the shaded region in the figure.
  - The shaded region includes several triangles and parallelograms.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - Area of a triangle: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
  - Area of a parallelogram: \( \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
  - Symmetry and equal-length markings suggest that some areas can be calculated using proportional reasoning.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define all points, lines, and shapes.
  - Capture relationships such as perpendicularity, equality of lengths, and right angles.
  - Include measurements for bases and heights.
  - Represent the composite nature of the figure using unions or intersections of shapes.
