REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram shows a right triangle with vertices labeled \( R \), \( P \), and \( Q \).
  - There is a vertical segment from \( Q \) to \( P \) forming one leg of the triangle.
  - There is a horizontal segment from \( P \) to \( R \) forming the other leg of the triangle.
  - The hypotenuse is the line segment from \( R \) to \( Q \).

- **Visible Measurements**:
  - The length of the hypotenuse \( RQ \) is 15.
  - The length of the vertical leg \( PQ \) is 17.
  - The length of the horizontal leg \( PR \) is 8.

- **Special Markings**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at point \( P \), indicating that \( \angle RPQ \) is a right angle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The triangle \( RPQ \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( P \).
  - The sides \( PR \) and \( PQ \) are perpendicular to each other.
  - The hypotenuse \( RQ \) is opposite the right angle.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies: \( PR^2 + PQ^2 = RQ^2 \).
  - The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( PR = 8 \) (horizontal leg).
  - \( PQ = 17 \) (vertical leg).
  - \( RQ = 15 \) (hypotenuse).

- **Relevant Measurements**:
  - The question asks for the cosine of \( \angle P \). In the context of the right triangle, \( \cos P \) refers to the cosine of the angle at \( P \), which is the ratio of the adjacent side \( PR \) to the hypotenuse \( RQ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The question asks for the ratio of \( \cos P \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
  - Since \( \cos P = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{PR}{RQ} \), we need to compute this ratio and round it to two decimal places.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the triangle and its components.
  - Define the right angle.
  - Specify the lengths of the sides.
  - Ensure all geometric relationships are captured without solving the problem explicitly.
