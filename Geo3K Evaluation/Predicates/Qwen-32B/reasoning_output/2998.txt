### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - There is a right angle at \( A \) (indicated by the right angle symbol).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( AB \) is one side of the triangle, with length \( 14 \).
  - \( AC \) is the other side adjacent to the right angle.
  - \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle, labeled as \( y \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BAC \) is a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
  - \( \angle ABC \) is labeled as \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - \( AB \) is one leg of the triangle, and \( AC \) is the other leg.
  - \( BC \) is the hypotenuse.
  - Since \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \), \( \angle BCA = 30^\circ \) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \)).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 14 \).
  - \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \).

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides have a specific ratio:
    - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( AC \)) is half the hypotenuse (\( BC \)).
    - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( y \), which is the hypotenuse \( BC \).
- To find \( y \), we use the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle:
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the length of the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.
  - Alternatively, we can use trigonometric relationships:
    - \( \cos(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{AB}{BC} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The predicates should capture the triangle's structure, the right angle, the given measurements, and the angle relationships.
