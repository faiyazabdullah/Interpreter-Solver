================================================================================
QUESTION: Find X Y of isosceles \triangle X Y Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a triangle labeled \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - The vertices are labeled \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - The sides of the triangle are represented as line segments:
    - \( XY \) with a length of \( 2x + 3 \).
    - \( YZ \) with a length of \( 4x - 1 \).
    - \( XZ \) with a length of \( 8x - 4 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - There are two hash marks on \( XY \) and \( YZ \), indicating that these two sides are congruent.

- **Measurements:**
  - The lengths of the sides are given as algebraic expressions:
    - \( XY = 2x + 3 \)
    - \( YZ = 4x - 1 \)
    - \( XZ = 8x - 4 \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruent Sides:**
  - The hash marks on \( XY \) and \( YZ \) indicate that \( XY \) and \( YZ \) are congruent.
  - Therefore, \( XY = YZ \).

- **Isosceles Triangle:**
  - Since \( XY = YZ \), \( \triangle XYZ \) is an isosceles triangle with \( XY \) and \( YZ \) as the equal sides.

- **Other Relationships:**
  - The base of the isosceles triangle is \( XZ \).
  - The lengths of the sides are related through the variable \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - The side lengths are expressed in terms of \( x \):
    - \( XY = 2x + 3 \)
    - \( YZ = 4x - 1 \)
    - \( XZ = 8x - 4 \)

- **Congruence Constraint:**
  - Since \( XY = YZ \), we have the equation:
    \[
    2x + 3 = 4x - 1
    \]
  - Solving for \( x \) will give us the specific lengths of the sides.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - The question asks for the length of \( XY \) in the isosceles triangle \( \triangle XYZ \).

- **Relevant Information:**
  - The triangle is isosceles with \( XY = YZ \).
  - The side lengths are given as algebraic expressions in terms of \( x \).

- **Steps to Solve:**
  1. Use the congruence condition \( XY = YZ \) to find the value of \( x \).
  2. Substitute the value of \( x \) back into the expression for \( XY \) to find its length.
