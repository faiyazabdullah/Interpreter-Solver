REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with vertices \( X, Y, Z \).
  - There is a smaller triangle \( \triangle WYT \) inside \( \triangle XYZ \), sharing the same orientation.
  - Points \( W, T, Z \) are collinear along one side of \( \triangle XYZ \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( XY = 16 \)
  - \( YZ = 10 \)
  - \( XZ = 20 \)
  - The segment \( WT \) is parallel to \( XZ \).
  - The segment \( WY \) is part of the triangle and is labeled as \( x \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Arrows indicate that \( WT \parallel XZ \), suggesting similarity between triangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - Since \( WT \parallel XZ \), triangles \( \triangle WYT \) and \( \triangle XYZ \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.
  - The corresponding sides are proportional.

- **Proportional Relationships**:
  - Because \( \triangle WYT \sim \triangle XYZ \), the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
    \[
    \frac{WY}{XY} = \frac{WT}{XZ} = \frac{YT}{YZ}
    \]

- **Shared Angles**:
  - \( \angle WYT = \angle XYZ \) and \( \angle WTY = \angle XZY \) due to parallel lines and corresponding angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( XY = 16 \)
  - \( YZ = 10 \)
  - \( XZ = 20 \)
  - \( WT = 10 \) (since \( WT \parallel XZ \) and \( WT \) is the segment along \( XZ \)).

- **Unknown Measurement**:
  - \( WY = x \) (to be determined).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), the length of segment \( WY \).
- To find \( x \), we use the similarity ratio between \( \triangle WYT \) and \( \triangle XYZ \):
  \[
  \frac{WY}{XY} = \frac{WT}{XZ}
  \]
- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \frac{x}{16} = \frac{10}{20}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key relationships are similarity, parallelism, and proportionality of sides.
