================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The vertices are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( C \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( AB \) is one side of the triangle, and its length is given as 73 units.
  - \( AC \) is another side of the triangle, and its length is denoted as \( x \).
  - The hypotenuse \( BC \) is the side opposite the right angle.

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BAC = 55^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) (right angle).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Properties:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle because it contains a right angle at \( C \).
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - Since \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \), the other two angles \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle ABC \) are complementary to \( 90^\circ \).

- **Side Relationships:**
  - In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies: \( AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \).
  - Alternatively, trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) can be used since the angles and one side are known.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 73 \) units.
  - \( \angle BAC = 55^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

- **Unknown Measurement:**
  - The length of side \( AC \) is denoted as \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of side \( AC \) (denoted as \( x \)).
- To find \( x \), we can use trigonometric relationships involving the given angles and the hypotenuse \( AB \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the right angle, the given angles, and the known side length.
- Trigonometric relationships will be used to express the connection between the sides and angles.
- The goal is to set up the necessary relationships without directly solving for \( x \).
