REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) is labeled as a rectangle.
  - Diagonals \(WZ\) and \(XY\) intersect at point \(A\).
  - Additional lines are drawn within the rectangle, forming triangles and smaller geometric figures.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \(WX\), \(XY\), \(YZ\), and \(ZW\) are the sides of the rectangle.
  - Diagonals \(WZ\) and \(XY\) intersect at \(A\).
  - Lines \(WA\), \(ZA\), \(XA\), and \(YA\) are drawn, dividing the rectangle into several triangles.

- **Angles**:
  - Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \ldots, \angle 12 \).
  - Right angle symbols are marked at corners \(W, X, Y,\) and \(Z\).

- **Measurements**:
  - \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) is given.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Rectangle**:
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel: \(WX \parallel YZ\) and \(WZ \parallel XY\).
  - All internal angles are right angles: \( \angle W, \angle X, \angle Y, \angle Z = 90^\circ \).
  - Diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other: \(WZ = XY\) and \(WA = AZ\), \(XA = AY\).

- **Triangles and Angles**:
  - Triangles are formed by the diagonals and additional lines. For example, \( \triangle WAX \), \( \triangle WAZ \), etc.
  - Angles at intersection points (like \(A\)) are related through properties like vertical angles and supplementary angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**:
  - \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).

- **Inferred Measurements**:
  - Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, all internal angles are \(90^\circ\).
  - The diagonals bisect each other, so \(WA = AZ\) and \(XA = AY\).
  - Angles around point \(A\) sum up to \(360^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 6 \).
- To find \( \angle 6 \), we need to use the properties of the rectangle, the given angle \( \angle 1 = 30^\circ \), and the relationships between angles formed by the diagonals and lines.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle, its diagonals, the intersection point, and the given angle.
- We must capture the relationships between the angles formed by the diagonals and the given angle \( \angle 1 \).
- The predicates should reflect the geometric properties of the rectangle and the relationships between the angles.
