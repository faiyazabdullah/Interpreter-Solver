================================================================================
QUESTION: If c = 5, find a.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are labeled as vertices of the triangle.
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( C \).

- **Lines and Sides:**
  - Line segments are labeled as follows:
    - \( a \): The vertical side \( BC \).
    - \( b \): The horizontal side \( CA \).
    - \( c \): The hypotenuse \( AB \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \) (right angle).
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CAB = 30^\circ \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The hypotenuse \( c = 5 \).
  - The other sides \( a \) and \( b \) are not explicitly given but need to be determined.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle at \( C \) is marked with a red square.
  - Angles at \( B \) and \( A \) are marked with blue arcs and degree measures.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Properties:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \).
  - The sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle CAB = 30^\circ \), making \( \triangle ABC \) a 30-60-90 triangle.
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \). Specifically:
    - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( a \)) is half the hypotenuse (\( c \)).
    - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( b \)) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) times the hypotenuse (\( c \)).

- **Side Relationships:**
  - Since \( c = 5 \), we can use the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle to find \( a \) and \( b \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( c = 5 \) (hypotenuse).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - For a 30-60-90 triangle:
    - \( a = \frac{c}{2} \).
    - \( b = \frac{c \sqrt{3}}{2} \).

- **Goal:**
  - Find the length of \( a \), which is the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( a \) when \( c = 5 \).
- Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we know:
  - \( a = \frac{c}{2} \).
  - Substituting \( c = 5 \):
    \[
    a = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5.
    \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram using atomic predicates.
- The predicates should capture the triangle, its angles, sides, and the specific properties of the 30-60-90 triangle without directly solving for \( a \).
