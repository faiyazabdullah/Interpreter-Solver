REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).
  - Points labeled: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DA\), \(AC\), and \(BD\).
  - Segments: \(AE\), \(EC\), \(BE\), and \(ED\).

- **Angles:**
  - Angles labeled: \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 8\).
  - Right angles at vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) (implied by the rectangle property).

- **Measurements:**
  - Side lengths: \(AB = 2\), \(BC = 7\), \(CD = 3\), \(DA = 6\).
  - Diagonal segments: \(AE = 1\), \(EC = 7\), \(BE = 6\), \(ED = 4\).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbol at \(\angle A\), indicating \(\angle DAB = 90^\circ\).
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at \(E\).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Rectangle Properties:**
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
  - All interior angles are right angles: \(\angle DAB = \angle ABC = \angle BCD = \angle CDA = 90^\circ\).
  - Diagonals are equal in length: \(AC = BD\).
  - Diagonals bisect each other: \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).

- **Diagonal Intersection:**
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\), dividing each diagonal into two segments.

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - \(\angle 2\) is part of \(\triangle ABE\).
  - \(\angle 8\) is part of \(\triangle CDE\).
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the diagonals are equal and bisect each other, making \(\triangle ABE\) and \(\triangle CDE\) similar by symmetry.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(m\angle 2 = 40^\circ\).
  - Segment lengths: \(AE = 1\), \(EC = 7\), \(BE = 6\), \(ED = 4\).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the diagonals are equal: \(AC = BD\).
  - Diagonals bisect each other: \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\) (though the segment lengths differ here, the property still holds conceptually).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for \(m\angle 8\).
- Key observations:
  - \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle 8\) are related through the symmetry and properties of the rectangle.
  - Since the diagonals bisect each other and the rectangle is symmetric, \(\angle 8\) will be equal to \(\angle 2\) due to the congruence of triangles formed by the diagonals.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- Represent the rectangle and its properties.
- Capture the relationships between the diagonals and their intersection.
- Include angle measurements and the symmetry properties of the rectangle.
- Avoid direct solutions but ensure all necessary relationships are represented.
