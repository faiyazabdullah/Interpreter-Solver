REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a pentagon \( ABCDE \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E \) are the vertices of the pentagon.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Lines connect the vertices sequentially to form the pentagon.
  - Angles are marked at specific vertices:
    - \( \angle C = (x + 24)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle D = x^\circ \)
    - \( \angle B = 115^\circ \)
    - \( \angle A = (2y - 56)^\circ \)
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols are present at \( \angle C \) and \( \angle D \), indicating that these angles are \( 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Analysis:**
  - The pentagon can be divided into a quadrilateral \( ABCE \) and a triangle \( CDE \).
  - Since \( \angle C \) and \( \angle D \) are right angles (\( 90^\circ \)), the quadrilateral \( ABCE \) has two right angles.
  
- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
  - The given angles \( \angle C = (x + 24)^\circ \), \( \angle D = x^\circ \), \( \angle B = 115^\circ \), and \( \angle A = (2y - 56)^\circ \) must satisfy this property.
  - The presence of right angles simplifies the problem since \( \angle C = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle D = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( \angle C = 90^\circ \) (right angle)
  - \( \angle D = 90^\circ \) (right angle)
  - \( \angle B = 115^\circ \)
  - \( \angle A = (2y - 56)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle E \) is the remaining angle in the pentagon, which we will calculate later.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Find the value of \( x \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
  - The given angles \( \angle C = 90^\circ \), \( \angle D = 90^\circ \), \( \angle B = 115^\circ \), and \( \angle A = (2y - 56)^\circ \) must satisfy this equation.
  - The value of \( x \) is part of the angle \( \angle C = (x + 24)^\circ \), which is already known to be \( 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the pentagon and its vertices.
  - Define the angles and their measurements.
  - Capture the property that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is \( 540^\circ \).
  - Use the given information about right angles and the expressions for the angles.
