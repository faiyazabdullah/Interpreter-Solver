QUESTION: Find z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( Y, X, Z, A, B \).
- **Lines**: 
  - Line \( YA \) is horizontal and has a length of 5.
  - Line \( AB \) is vertical and has a length labeled as \( z \).
  - Line \( YB \) is diagonal and has a length of 14.
  - Line \( AX \) is diagonal and intersects \( YB \) at point \( X \).
  - Line \( XB \) is also diagonal.
- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle at \( \angle YAX \) indicated by the red square.
  - There is a right angle at \( \angle AXB \) indicated by the red square.
- **Special Markings**:
  - The diagram suggests that \( AX \) and \( XB \) form two segments of the diagonal \( YB \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles**:
  - Triangle \( YAB \) is formed by points \( Y, A, B \).
  - Triangle \( YAX \) is a right triangle with \( \angle YAX = 90^\circ \).
  - Triangle \( AXB \) is a right triangle with \( \angle AXB = 90^\circ \).
- **Perpendicular Relationships**:
  - Line \( YA \) is perpendicular to line \( AB \).
  - Line \( AX \) is perpendicular to line \( XB \).
- **Segments**:
  - Line \( YB \) is divided into two segments by point \( X \): \( YX \) and \( XB \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( YA = 5 \) (horizontal segment).
  - \( YB = 14 \) (diagonal segment).
  - \( AB = z \) (vertical segment, to be determined).
- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \( \triangle YAB \) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate \( YA, AB, \) and \( YB \).
  - Similarly, \( \triangle YAX \) and \( \triangle AXB \) are right triangles, and their properties will help us solve for \( z \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( z \), which represents the length of segment \( AB \).
- To find \( z \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( YAB \):
  \[
  YB^2 = YA^2 + AB^2
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  14^2 = 5^2 + z^2
  \]
  Solving for \( z \):
  \[
  196 = 25 + z^2 \implies z^2 = 171 \implies z = \sqrt{171}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Ensure that all visible information is captured without directly stating the solution.
