REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present.
  - Four points are labeled: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - Point \( D \) is located inside the circle, likely the center.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Chords \( AB \) and \( AC \) are drawn within the circle.
  
- **Angles:**
  - An angle \( \angle BAC \) is marked, and its measure is given as \( 122^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, congruence, or parallelism are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( AB \) and \( AC \) are chords of the circle.
  - \( D \) is the center of the circle, as it is equidistant from \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The angle \( \angle BAC \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( BC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Visible Measurements:**
  - The measure of \( \angle BAC \) is \( 122^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle B \).
- Since \( \angle B \) is part of the cyclic quadrilateral formed by the circle, we need to use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and inscribed angles.
- The key property is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. However, since \( \angle B \) is not explicitly an inscribed angle, we need to consider the cyclic quadrilateral properties or other angle relationships.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- The relationships involve the circle, its center, the inscribed angle, and the cyclic nature of the quadrilateral.
- Predicates will capture the circle, its center, the chords, and the given angle measure.
