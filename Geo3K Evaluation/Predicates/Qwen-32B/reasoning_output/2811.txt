REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines**:
  - \( AB \) is one side of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is another side of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

- **Measurements**:
  - The length of \( AC \) is given as 16 units.
  - The length of \( BC \) is given as 10 units.
  
- **Special Markings**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \), indicating that \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies: \( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \).

- **Constraints**:
  - The lengths of \( AC \) and \( BC \) are given.
  - The angle \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( AC = 16 \) units.
  - \( BC = 10 \) units.
  - The length of \( AB \) is not given but can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The question asks for the measure of the angle \( x \) at vertex \( B \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, the sum of the angles in the triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The angle \( x \) is the angle opposite the side \( BC \) and adjacent to the side \( AB \).
  - Using trigonometric relationships (specifically the tangent function), we can find \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the triangle, its sides, and the right angle.
  - Capture the given measurements and the relationships between them.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are included.
