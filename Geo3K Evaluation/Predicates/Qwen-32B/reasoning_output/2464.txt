REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The image contains points labeled \( W, X, Y, Z, D, T \).
- **Lines**: 
  - A vertical line passing through \( Y \), which is labeled as \( m \).
  - Lines connecting \( W \) to \( X \), \( W \) to \( Z \), and \( D \) to \( T \).
  - Line segments \( WX \), \( WZ \), \( XZ \), and others.
- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol at \( \angle XYZ \), indicating \( \angle XYZ = 90^\circ \).
  - \( m \) is marked as the perpendicular bisector of \( XZ \).
  - The segment \( WZ \) is given as \( 14.9 \) units.
- **Shapes**: 
  - Triangle \( WXZ \) is formed by points \( W, X, Z \).
  - The perpendicular bisector property suggests symmetry around \( Y \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Perpendicular Bisector Relationship**:
  - Line \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( XZ \). This implies:
    1. \( XY = YZ \) (perpendicular bisector divides the segment into two equal parts).
    2. \( m \) is perpendicular to \( XZ \) at point \( Y \).
- **Right Angle**:
  - \( \angle XYZ = 90^\circ \), confirming that \( m \) is indeed perpendicular to \( XZ \).
- **Symmetry**:
  - Since \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector, \( W \) is equidistant from \( X \) and \( Z \) due to the symmetry.
- **Triangle Properties**:
  - Triangle \( WXZ \) is isosceles because \( WX = WZ \) due to the symmetry imposed by the perpendicular bisector.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( WZ = 14.9 \) units.
- **Implied Measurements**:
  - Since \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector, \( XY = YZ \).
  - Due to symmetry, \( WX = WZ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( WX \).
- From the analysis, we know:
  1. \( WZ = 14.9 \).
  2. Due to the perpendicular bisector property and symmetry, \( WX = WZ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Predicates should capture:
  - The perpendicular bisector relationship.
  - The right angle at \( \angle XYZ \).
  - The equality of lengths \( WX \) and \( WZ \).
  - The given measurement \( WZ = 14.9 \).
