REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image depicts a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - Side \( AB \) is labeled with an angle of \( 60^\circ \) at vertex \( A \).
  - Side \( AC \) has a length of 11 units.
  - Side \( BC \) has a length of 12 units.
  - Angle \( \angle BAC \) is explicitly marked as \( 60^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No special markings indicating perpendicularity, parallelism, or congruence are visible.
  - The problem focuses on solving for the unknown angle \( x^\circ \) at vertex \( B \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a scalene triangle because all sides have different lengths.
  - The angle at vertex \( A \) is given as \( 60^\circ \).
  - The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( AB \): Side length is not directly given but can be inferred from the context.
  - \( AC = 11 \) units.
  - \( BC = 12 \) units.
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \).

- **What Measurements Represent:**
  - The lengths \( AC \) and \( BC \) are sides of the triangle.
  - The angle \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \) is one of the interior angles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks to find the measure of angle \( x^\circ \) at vertex \( B \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The Law of Sines or Cosines could also be used if needed, but the problem can be solved using basic angle relationships.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and its vertices.
  - Define the given angle and side lengths.
  - Use the property that the sum of the interior angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - Avoid directly stating the solution but ensure all necessary relationships are represented.
