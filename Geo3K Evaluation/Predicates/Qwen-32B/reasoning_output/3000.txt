REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - The quadrilateral is marked as a rhombus, meaning all sides are equal.
  - There is a point \(P\) inside the rhombus where diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect.
  - The diagonals appear to bisect each other at right angles.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - \(PB = 12\).
  - \(AB = 15\).
  - \(\angle ABD = 24^\circ\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at \(P\), and they seem to form right angles at \(P\).
  - The sides \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are equal since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus:
    - All sides are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
    - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect each other at right angles.
    - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect the angles of the rhombus.
  - Point \(P\) is the intersection of the diagonals, and it is the midpoint of both diagonals.
  - \(\angle ABD = 24^\circ\) implies that \(\angle ABD\) is one of the angles formed by the diagonal \(BD\) and a side of the rhombus.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \(PB = 12\): The segment from \(P\) to \(B\) along diagonal \(BD\).
  - \(AB = 15\): The side length of the rhombus.
  - \(\angle ABD = 24^\circ\): The angle between side \(AB\) and diagonal \(BD\).

- **Implications**:
  - Since \(P\) is the midpoint of \(BD\), \(BD = 2 \times PB = 2 \times 12 = 24\).
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, so \(\angle APB = 90^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle BDA\).
- To find \(\angle BDA\):
  - Use the property that the diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles of the rhombus.
  - Since \(\angle ABD = 24^\circ\), the diagonal \(BD\) bisects \(\angle ABC\) and \(\angle ADC\).
  - \(\angle BDA\) is part of the angle bisected by diagonal \(BD\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the rhombus and its properties.
  - Represent the diagonals and their relationships.
  - Represent the given measurements and angles.
  - Capture the fact that diagonals bisect each other at right angles and bisect the angles of the rhombus.
