REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a circle centered at point \( T \).
  - Points \( X, Y, Z, W \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( T \) is the center of the circle.
  - Lines \( XZ, ZV, VW, WT, TX, XY \) are drawn.

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations:**
  - \( ZV = 1 \): The segment \( ZV \) has a length of 1 unit.
  - \( TW = 13 \): The segment \( TW \) has a length of 13 units.
  - There is a right angle at \( \angle TVW \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( \angle TVW \) is marked as a right angle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( T \) is the center of the circle, so \( TX, TY, TZ, TW \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( XY \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( ZV \) is a segment inside the circle, and \( TW \) is a radius.
  - Since \( \angle TVW \) is a right angle, \( TV \) and \( VW \) form a right triangle \( TVW \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( ZV = 1 \): The length of segment \( ZV \).
  - \( TW = 13 \): The length of radius \( TW \).

- **Measurement Interpretation:**
  - \( TW \) is a radius of the circle, so the radius \( r \) of the circle is 13 units.
  - Since \( T \) is the center, \( TX = TY = TZ = TW = 13 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the length of \( XY \).
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - \( XY \) is a chord of the circle.
  - To find \( XY \), we need to use properties of circles, such as the fact that the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord.
  - The right angle at \( \angle TVW \) provides additional information about the configuration of points.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify the points on the circle and their relationships.
  - Capture the given measurements and the right angle.
  - Represent the relationships between the segments and the circle.
