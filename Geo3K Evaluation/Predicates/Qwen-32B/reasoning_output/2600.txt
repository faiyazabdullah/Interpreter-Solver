REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - The figure is a rectangle \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - A diagonal \(AC\) is drawn inside the rectangle.

- **Points:**
  - \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are the vertices of the rectangle.

- **Lines:**
  - \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are the sides of the rectangle.
  - \(AC\) is the diagonal connecting \(A\) and \(C\).

- **Measurements:**
  - The length of side \(AB\) (or \(CD\)) is labeled as \(8\).
  - The length of side \(AD\) (or \(BC\)) is labeled as \(x\).
  - The length of the diagonal \(AC\) is labeled as \(16\).

- **Angles:**
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(B\), indicating that \(\angle ABC\) is a right angle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rectangle Properties:**
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD = 8\) and \(AD = BC = x\).
  - All internal angles are right angles: \(\angle A = \angle B = \angle C = \angle D = 90^\circ\).

- **Diagonal Properties:**
  - The diagonal \(AC\) divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles (\(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ADC\)).
  - In \(\triangle ABC\), \(AC\) is the hypotenuse, and \(AB\) and \(BC\) are the legs.

- **Right Triangle Relationship:**
  - Since \(\triangle ABC\) is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies: \(AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(AB = 8\)
  - \(AC = 16\)
  - \(BC = x\)

- **Unknown Measurement:**
  - The length \(x\) represents the side \(AD\) (or \(BC\)) of the rectangle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(x\), which is the length of side \(BC\) (or \(AD\)).
- To find \(x\), we use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABC\):
  \[
  AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  16^2 = 8^2 + x^2
  \]
  Solving for \(x\):
  \[
  256 = 64 + x^2 \implies x^2 = 192 \implies x = \sqrt{192} = 8\sqrt{3}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints in the figure.
- Predicates will include the rectangle, its sides, the diagonal, the right angle, and the Pythagorean relationship.
