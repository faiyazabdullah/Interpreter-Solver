REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A square \(ABDC\) is inscribed in a circle \(\odot K\).
  - The center of the circle is labeled \(F\).
  - Additional points \(G\) and \(C, D\) are marked on the square.
  - Right angles are indicated at \(C\) and \(D\).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - The square \(ABDC\) has sides \(AB\), \(BD\), \(DC\), and \(CA\).
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(F\), the center of the circle.
  - Right angles are explicitly marked at vertices \(C\) and \(D\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The square is symmetric, and its diagonals are diameters of the circle.
  - The circle is centered at \(F\), and the square's vertices lie on the circumference.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Square Properties**:
  - All sides of the square are equal.
  - All interior angles are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
  - The diagonals of the square are equal and bisect each other at right angles.
  - The diagonals are also diameters of the circumscribed circle.

- **Circle Properties**:
  - The square is inscribed in the circle, meaning all four vertices of the square lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The center of the circle \(F\) is also the intersection point of the diagonals of the square.

- **Key Relationships**:
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are diameters of the circle.
  - The diagonals are perpendicular to each other.
  - Each side of the square subtends a central angle at the center of the circle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - No explicit numerical values are given for lengths or angles in the diagram.
  - However, the properties of the square and circle allow us to deduce certain relationships.

- **Inferred Measurements**:
  - Since the square is inscribed in the circle, each side of the square subtends a central angle.
  - The total angle around the center of the circle is \(360^\circ\).
  - The square divides the circle into four equal arcs, so each arc corresponds to a central angle of \(90^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of a central angle.
- Given that the square is inscribed in the circle, each side of the square subtends a central angle.
- Since the square divides the circle into four equal parts, each central angle corresponding to a side of the square is \(90^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and properties identified above.
- The predicates should capture the square, the circle, the center, the diagonals, and the central angles.
- The final answer will be derived from the fact that each side of the square subtends a central angle of \(90^\circ\).
