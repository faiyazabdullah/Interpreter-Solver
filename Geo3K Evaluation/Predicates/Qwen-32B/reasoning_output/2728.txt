REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - A circle is shown with center \( D \).
  - A regular hexagon is inscribed within the circle, with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
  - The shaded region is the area between the circle and the hexagon.

- **Points and Lines:**
  - Center of the circle: \( D \).
  - Vertices of the hexagon: \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
  - Radii of the circle: \( DA, DB, DC, DE, DF \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The radius of the circle is given as \( 10 \) cm.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The hexagon is regular, indicating all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal.
  - The shaded region represents the area outside the hexagon but inside the circle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The hexagon is inscribed in the circle, meaning all its vertices lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The circle is circumscribed around the hexagon.
  - The radius of the circle is the distance from the center \( D \) to any vertex of the hexagon.
  - Since the hexagon is regular, it is equilateral and equiangular.

- **Implied Properties:**
  - The central angles subtended by the sides of the hexagon are equal (each \( 60^\circ \)).
  - Each side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circle (since it is a regular hexagon inscribed in a circle).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Radius of the circle: \( 10 \) cm.
  - Side length of the hexagon: \( 10 \) cm (equal to the radius).

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - The area of the circle can be calculated using the formula \( \pi r^2 \).
  - The area of the regular hexagon can be calculated as the sum of six equilateral triangles, each with side length \( 10 \) cm.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the area of the shaded region, which is the difference between the area of the circle and the area of the inscribed hexagon.
  - Round the result to the nearest tenth.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - Area of a circle: \( \pi r^2 \).
  - Area of a regular hexagon: \( \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2 \), where \( s \) is the side length.
  - Shaded area = Area of the circle - Area of the hexagon.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the circle, its center, and radius.
  - Define the hexagon and its properties (regular, inscribed).
  - Relate the radius of the circle to the side length of the hexagon.
  - Represent the shaded region as the difference between the circle's area and the hexagon's area.
