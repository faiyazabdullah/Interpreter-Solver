REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle with center \( O \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, E, F \) are shown.
  - Segments \( AE \) and \( AF \) appear to be tangents from point \( A \) to the circle.
  - Segments \( BE \) and \( CF \) are chords of the circle.
  - The segment \( BC \) is part of the circle's circumference.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - The length of segment \( AE \) is given as \( \sqrt{174} \).
  - The length of segment \( BE \) is given as \( 3x + 5 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The segments \( AE \) and \( AF \) are marked as tangents to the circle, implying they are equal in length due to the tangent-tangent property.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since \( AE \) and \( AF \) are tangents from the same external point \( A \) to the circle, they are congruent: \( AE = AF \).
  - The lengths of the tangents from a point to a circle are equal.
  - The segment \( BE \) is part of the circle's structure, and its length is related to the variable \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( AE = \sqrt{174} \).
  - \( BE = 3x + 5 \).

- **Measurement Relationships:**
  - Since \( AE \) and \( AF \) are tangents, \( AE = AF = \sqrt{174} \).
  - The length \( BE \) is expressed in terms of \( x \): \( BE = 3x + 5 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The problem requires finding the value of \( x \) to the nearest tenth.
  - The key relationship here is the use of the tangent-tangent property and the given lengths.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, tangents, and chords.
  - Capture the equality of tangents \( AE \) and \( AF \).
  - Express the length of \( BE \) in terms of \( x \).
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are included.
