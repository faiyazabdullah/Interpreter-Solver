REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure consists of a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are labeled.
  - \( B \) is the top vertex, \( A \) is the bottom-left vertex, and \( C \) is the bottom-right vertex.
  
- **Lines and Angles**:
  - \( \overline{AB} \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - \( \overline{BC} \) is one of the legs of the triangle.
  - \( \overline{AC} \) is the other leg of the triangle.
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle (marked with a square symbol).

- **Measurements**:
  - The hypotenuse \( \overline{AB} \) is given as 10 units.
  - The leg \( \overline{BC} \) is labeled \( y \).
  - The leg \( \overline{AC} \) is labeled \( x \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \overline{AB} \) is the hypotenuse.
  - \( \overline{AC} \) and \( \overline{BC} \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - The angle \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \) implies that \( \angle BCA = 30^\circ \) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \)).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - Hypotenuse \( \overline{AB} = 10 \) units.
  - One angle \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \).
  - The other angle \( \angle BCA = 30^\circ \).

- **Implications**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides have a specific ratio:
    - Hypotenuse (\( \overline{AB} \)) = \( 2x \),
    - Longer leg (\( \overline{AC} \)) = \( x\sqrt{3} \),
    - Shorter leg (\( \overline{BC} \)) = \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of the leg \( \overline{AC} \).
- To find \( x \), we use the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle and the given hypotenuse length.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will include the triangle, its angles, sides, and the specific properties of the 30-60-90 triangle.
