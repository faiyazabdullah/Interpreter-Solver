REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a quadrilateral labeled \( D E F G \).
  - There are additional points \( A \) and \( C \) inside the quadrilateral.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines connecting the vertices of the quadrilateral: \( D E \), \( E F \), \( F G \), and \( G D \).
  - Diagonals \( D F \) and \( E G \) intersect at point \( A \).
  - A vertical segment \( G C \) is drawn from point \( G \) to the diagonal \( D F \).

- **Angles:**
  - Angles \( \angle E D F \) and \( \angle D F G \) are explicitly mentioned in the problem.
  - A right angle symbol is marked at \( \angle D G F \), indicating \( \angle D G F = 90^\circ \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The measure of \( \angle E D F \) is given as \( 5x - 3 \).
  - The measure of \( \angle D F G \) is given as \( 3x + 7 \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties:**
  - Quadrilateral \( D E F G \) is specified as a rectangle.
  - In a rectangle, all interior angles are right angles (\( 90^\circ \)).
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol at \( \angle D G F \) confirms one of the right angles in the rectangle.
  - The diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other.

- **Relevant Constraints:**
  - Since \( D E F G \) is a rectangle, \( \angle E D F \) and \( \angle D F G \) are part of the internal angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals.
  - The sum of the angles around point \( D \) must satisfy the properties of a rectangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measures:**
  - \( m \angle E D F = 5x - 3 \)
  - \( m \angle D F G = 3x + 7 \)
  
- **Inferred Relationships:**
  - Since \( D E F G \) is a rectangle, the diagonals \( D F \) and \( E G \) intersect at point \( A \), dividing the rectangle into four triangles.
  - The angles \( \angle E D F \) and \( \angle D F G \) are adjacent angles forming part of the larger right angles in the rectangle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks us to find the measure of \( \angle E D F \).
- To solve this, we need to use the given expressions for \( m \angle E D F \) and \( m \angle D F G \) and the fact that the sum of angles around point \( D \) in the context of the rectangle must be consistent with the properties of a rectangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the shape, angles, and relationships without directly solving for the final answer.
