================================================================================
QUESTION: The perimeter of this polygon is 60 centimeters. Find the length of the side of the polygon.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: The image shows a pentagon with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the pentagon are represented by lines connecting these vertices: \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( DE \), and \( EA \).
- **Special Markings**: Each side of the pentagon has small tick marks indicating that all sides are congruent. This suggests the pentagon is regular.
- **Colors and Labels**: The pentagon is outlined in blue, and the vertices are marked with red dots. There are no explicit numerical measurements given in the image.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Regular Pentagon**: The tick marks on each side indicate that all sides are equal in length. Therefore, the pentagon is regular.
- **Congruent Sides**: Since it is a regular pentagon, all sides are congruent: \( AB = BC = CD = DE = EA \).
- **Symmetry**: Regular pentagons exhibit rotational and reflectional symmetry.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**: The perimeter of the pentagon is explicitly stated as 60 cm.
- **Unknown Measurement**: The length of each side of the pentagon is unknown but needs to be determined.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of one side of the pentagon.
- To find this, we use the relationship between the perimeter and the number of sides in a regular polygon:
  \[
  \text{Perimeter} = \text{Number of sides} \times \text{Length of one side}
  \]
- Here, the perimeter is 60 cm, and the number of sides is 5. Thus, the length of one side can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Length of one side} = \frac{\text{Perimeter}}{\text{Number of sides}} = \frac{60}{5} = 12 \text{ cm}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the pentagon, its regularity, the equality of its sides, and the given perimeter.
- Predicates should capture the fact that the pentagon is regular, all sides are congruent, and the perimeter is 60 cm.
