### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Point \( C \) is the vertex of the right angle.
  - Points \( A \) and \( B \) are the endpoints of the hypotenuse.
  - There is a perpendicular line segment \( CD \) dropped from \( C \) to the hypotenuse \( AB \), forming two smaller right triangles: \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle BCD \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( AC \) and \( BC \) are the legs of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( CD \) is the altitude from \( C \) to \( AB \).
  - \( AD \) and \( DB \) are segments of the hypotenuse \( AB \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( AD = 8 \) units.
  - \( DB = 12.5 \) units.
  - \( AB = AD + DB = 8 + 12.5 = 20.5 \) units.

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle, indicated by the right angle symbol.
  - \( CD \) is perpendicular to \( AB \), indicated by the right angle at \( D \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
  - \( CD \) is the altitude from the right angle \( C \) to the hypotenuse \( AB \).
  - \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle BCD \) are also right triangles.
  - By the properties of right triangles, the altitude \( CD \) divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two smaller right triangles that are similar to each other and to \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to \( \triangle ABC \): \( AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2 \).
  - The altitude \( CD \) creates proportional segments on the hypotenuse: \( \frac{AD}{DB} = \frac{AC^2}{BC^2} \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( AD = 8 \) units.
  - \( DB = 12.5 \) units.
  - \( AB = 20.5 \) units (sum of \( AD \) and \( DB \)).
  - \( y \) represents the length of \( AC \).
  - \( z \) represents the length of \( BC \).
  - \( x \) represents the length of the altitude \( CD \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem: \( y^2 + z^2 = AB^2 = 20.5^2 \).
  - Using the property of the altitude in a right triangle: \( CD^2 = AD \cdot DB = 8 \cdot 12.5 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( y \), which is the length of \( AC \).
- To find \( y \), we need to use the relationships established by the right triangle properties and the altitude \( CD \):
  - The altitude \( CD \) divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two smaller right triangles, and the segments \( AD \) and \( DB \) are related to the squares of the legs \( AC \) and \( BC \).
  - We can use the similarity of triangles and the Pythagorean theorem to solve for \( y \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the triangle and its components.
  - Specify the right angle and perpendicular relationships.
  - Capture the measurements and their relationships.
  - Represent the similarity and proportionality induced by the altitude.
