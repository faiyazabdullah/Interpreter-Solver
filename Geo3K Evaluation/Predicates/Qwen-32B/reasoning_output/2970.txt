REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure consists of two right triangles, \( \triangle BWX \) and \( \triangle CWZ \).
  - Points labeled: \( A, B, C, X, W, Y, Z \).
  - Line segments: \( BX, CX, WY, WZ, XY, YZ \).

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( BX = 4 \).
  - \( CX = 4 \).
  - \( \angle WYZ = 23^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols at \( \angle BWX \) and \( \angle CWZ \).
  - \( \angle BWX \) and \( \angle CWZ \) are both right angles (90Â°).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle BWX \) and \( \triangle CWZ \) are right triangles.
  - \( BX \) and \( CX \) are legs of the right triangles.
  - \( WY \) and \( WZ \) are hypotenuses of the right triangles.
  - Since \( BX = CX = 4 \), the triangles share a common hypotenuse \( WY = WZ \).

- **Implied Properties:**
  - \( \triangle BWX \cong \triangle CWZ \) by the properties of isosceles right triangles.
  - \( W \) is the center of symmetry for the configuration.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( BX = 4 \) and \( CX = 4 \) imply the legs of the right triangles are equal.
  - \( \angle WYZ = 23^\circ \) is given.

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( \triangle BWX \cong \triangle CWZ \), \( WY = WZ \).
  - The configuration suggests symmetry about the line \( XY \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Goal:** Find \( m\angle WYZ \).
- **Relevant Information:**
  - \( \angle WYZ = 23^\circ \) is explicitly given in the diagram.
  - No additional calculations are required since the angle is already provided.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the right triangles, their sides, and the given angle.
  - Capture the equality of lengths and the right angles.
  - Ensure all visible relationships are included.
