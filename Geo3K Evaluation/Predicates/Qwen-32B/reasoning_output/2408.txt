REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram shows a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - Points \( X, Y, Z \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Points \( M \) and \( N \) lie on the sides of the triangle.
  - Line segments \( XM \), \( MN \), and \( NZ \) are part of the triangle's sides.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( XY, YZ, XZ \) form the sides of \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - Line segment \( XM \) is part of \( XY \).
  - Line segment \( MN \) is part of \( XZ \).
  - Line segment \( NZ \) is part of \( XZ \).

- **Angles**:
  - There are right angles at \( \angle XMY \) and \( \angle ZNY \). This is indicated by the right-angle symbols.

- **Measurements**:
  - \( XN = 6 \)
  - \( XM = 2 \)
  - \( XY = 10 \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle XMY \) and \( \triangle ZNY \) are right triangles because of the right angles at \( M \) and \( N \).
  - \( M \) and \( N \) divide the sides of the larger triangle into smaller segments.
  - \( XZ \) is divided into two parts: \( XN \) and \( NZ \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - Since \( M \) and \( N \) lie on the sides of the triangle, they create similar sub-triangles within \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - The right angles imply that the triangles formed are right triangles, which can help in applying the Pythagorean theorem or similarity principles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( XN = 6 \): Length of segment \( XN \).
  - \( XM = 2 \): Length of segment \( XM \).
  - \( XY = 10 \): Length of side \( XY \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - Since \( M \) lies on \( XY \), the remaining part of \( XY \) is \( MY = XY - XM = 10 - 2 = 8 \).
  - \( XZ \) is composed of \( XN \) and \( NZ \), where \( XZ = XN + NZ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - Find the length of \( NZ \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The right angles at \( M \) and \( N \) suggest that the triangles \( \triangle XMY \) and \( \triangle ZNY \) are right triangles.
  - The problem likely involves using the properties of similar triangles or the Pythagorean theorem to find \( NZ \).

- **Information Needed**:
  - The length of \( NZ \) can be determined by analyzing the relationship between the segments \( XN \) and \( NZ \) along the side \( XZ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the points, lines, and angles explicitly.
  - Capture the right angles and the lengths of the segments.
  - Represent the relationships between the segments \( XN \), \( NZ \), and \( XZ \).
