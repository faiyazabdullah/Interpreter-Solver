STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2748
================================================================================
QUESTION: Which of the following facts would be sufficient to prove that line d is parallel to X Z?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( X \), \( Y \), \( Z \), \( A \), and \( B \).
- **Lines**: 
  - Line segment \( XY \) is part of the triangle \( XYZ \).
  - Line segment \( YZ \) is part of the triangle \( XYZ \).
  - Line segment \( XZ \) forms the base of the triangle \( XYZ \).
  - Line \( d \) passes through points \( A \) and \( B \) and is drawn parallel to \( XZ \).
- **Angles**: 
  - Angles are marked at vertices \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) of the triangle.
  - The angles formed by line \( d \) and the sides of the triangle are labeled as \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( 3 \).
- **Special Markings**: 
  - The red dots indicate vertices of the triangle and points where lines intersect.
  - There are no explicit right-angle or congruence markings.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle**: The points \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) form a triangle \( XYZ \).
- **Parallel Lines**: Line \( d \) is drawn parallel to the base \( XZ \) of the triangle.
- **Intersection**: Line \( d \) intersects the sides \( XY \) and \( YZ \) of the triangle at points \( A \) and \( B \), respectively.
- **Angles**: 
  - The angles labeled \( 1 \), \( 2 \), and \( 3 \) are formed by the intersections of line \( d \) with the sides of the triangle.
  - Corresponding angles and alternate interior angles can be used to establish parallelism.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical measurements are provided for lengths or angles in the diagram.
- The focus is on the geometric relationships and properties rather than specific measurements.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks which facts would be sufficient to prove that line \( d \) is parallel to line \( XZ \).
- To prove parallelism, we need to use geometric properties such as:
  - Corresponding angles being equal.
  - Alternate interior angles being equal.
  - Co-interior angles being supplementary.
- The key is to identify the relevant angle relationships between line \( d \) and the sides of triangle \( XYZ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships that can be used to prove parallelism.
- The predicates should capture the structure of the triangle, the parallel line, and the angle relationships.
- We will focus on the angles formed by the intersections of line \( d \) with the sides of the triangle.
