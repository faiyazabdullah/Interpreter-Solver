================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 2 if A B \perp B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The image contains points labeled \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \).
- **Lines**: Lines connecting these points form various segments, such as \( AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GC \).
- **Angles**: Several angles are marked with specific measures:
  - \( \angle DAB = 36^\circ \) (angle 2).
  - \( \angle ABC = 104^\circ \) (angle 1).
  - \( \angle CEF = 40^\circ \) (angle 7).
- **Special Markings**: The statement specifies \( AB \perp BC \), indicating a right angle at \( B \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Perpendicular Relationship**: \( AB \perp BC \) implies \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle.
- **Angle Relationships**: The angles around point \( B \) are part of a linear pair and a triangle.
  - \( \angle ABC = 104^\circ \) is given, but since \( AB \perp BC \), there might be a contradiction unless we interpret it differently (likely a mislabeling or additional context).
- **Triangle Formation**: Points \( A, B, C \) form a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle DAB = 36^\circ \) (angle 2).
  - \( \angle ABC = 104^\circ \) (but interpreted as \( 90^\circ \) due to \( AB \perp BC \)).
  - \( \angle CEF = 40^\circ \) (irrelevant to the primary question but useful for understanding the diagram).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 2 \), which is \( \angle DAB \).
- Since \( AB \perp BC \), \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \). This affects the interpretation of the angles around point \( B \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the right angle at \( B \), the given angles, and the relationship between them.
- The key is to focus on the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) and the given angle \( \angle DAB = 36^\circ \).
