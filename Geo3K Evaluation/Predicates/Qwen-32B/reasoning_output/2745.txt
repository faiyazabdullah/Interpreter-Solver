STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2745
================================================================================
QUESTION: A B C D is a parallelogram with side lengths as indicated in the figure at the right. The perimeter of A B C D is 22. Find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - The quadrilateral is marked with specific side lengths, indicating it is a parallelogram.
  
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - Lines: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\).

- **Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 2y + 1\)
  - \(BC = x - w + 1\)
  - \(CD = 3 - 4w\)
  - \(DA = 3x - 2\)

- **Special Markings**:
  - The figure is labeled as a parallelogram, implying opposite sides are equal.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = DA\).
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(BC \parallel DA\).

- **Constraints**:
  - The perimeter of the parallelogram is given as 22.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 2y + 1\)
  - \(BC = x - w + 1\)
  - \(CD = 3 - 4w\)
  - \(DA = 3x - 2\)

- **Relationships**:
  - Since \(AB = CD\), we have \(2y + 1 = 3 - 4w\).
  - Since \(BC = DA\), we have \(x - w + 1 = 3x - 2\).

- **Perimeter**:
  - The perimeter of the parallelogram is the sum of all sides: 
    \[
    AB + BC + CD + DA = 22
    \]
  - Using the property \(AB = CD\) and \(BC = DA\), the perimeter simplifies to:
    \[
    2(AB) + 2(BC) = 22
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of \(AB\).
- To solve this, we need to use the relationships derived from the parallelogram properties and the given perimeter constraint.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints using predicates.
- The predicates should capture:
  - The fact that \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.
  - The equalities of opposite sides (\(AB = CD\) and \(BC = DA\)).
  - The perimeter constraint.
  - The given side lengths.
