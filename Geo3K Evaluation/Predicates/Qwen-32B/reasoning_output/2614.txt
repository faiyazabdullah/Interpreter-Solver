REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a triangle \( \triangle EFG \).
  - Points \( E, F, G \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Point \( H \) lies on the line segment \( FG \).
  - Line \( EH \) is drawn from vertex \( E \) to point \( H \) on \( FG \).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Line segments \( EF, EG, FG \) form the sides of \( \triangle EFG \).
  - Line \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \).
  - Label "1" indicates one half of \( \angle E \), and label "2" indicates the other half.

- **Measurements:**
  - The angle at \( F \) is labeled \( 15x^\circ \).
  - No other specific measurements are given for angles or lengths.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruence marks are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle EFG \) is equilateral, meaning all sides are equal, and all internal angles are \( 60^\circ \).
  - Since \( \triangle EFG \) is equilateral, \( \angle E = 60^\circ \).
  - Line \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \), so it divides \( \angle E \) into two equal parts.
  - Therefore, \( \angle 1 = \angle 2 \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - Since \( \triangle EFG \) is equilateral, \( \angle E = \angle F = \angle G = 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - The angle at \( F \) is given as \( 15x^\circ \). However, since \( \triangle EFG \) is equilateral, \( \angle F = 60^\circ \). Thus, we can deduce that \( 15x = 60 \), which implies \( x = 4 \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( \angle E = 60^\circ \) and \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \), each half-angle is \( 30^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle 1 = \angle 2 = 30^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 2 \).
  - Given that \( \triangle EFG \) is equilateral and \( EH \) bisects \( \angle E \), we need to determine the measure of one of the halves of \( \angle E \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The property of an equilateral triangle: All angles are \( 60^\circ \).
  - The property of an angle bisector: It divides the angle into two equal parts.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the equilateral triangle \( \triangle EFG \).
  - Represent the angle bisector \( EH \).
  - Capture the fact that \( \angle E = 60^\circ \) and is divided into two equal parts.
  - Ensure all relationships and constraints are explicitly stated.
