REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is labeled as \(\odot P\).
  - Points \(K\), \(J\), \(N\), \(M\), and \(L\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Point \(P\) is the center of the circle.
  - Segments \(PM\), \(PN\), \(PJ\), \(PK\), and \(PL\) are radii of the circle.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - \(NP\) is perpendicular to \(PL\) (indicated by a right angle symbol).
  - \(\angle MPL\) is labeled as \(65^\circ\).

- **Arcs:**
  - The arc \(\widehat{NM}\) is part of the circle and is the focus of the problem.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - All radii of a circle are equal in length.
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
  
- **Perpendicularity:**
  - \(NP \perp PL\) implies \(\angle NPL = 90^\circ\).

- **Central Angles and Arcs:**
  - The central angle \(\angle MPL\) intercepts the arc \(\widehat{ML}\).
  - The arc \(\widehat{NM}\) is part of the remaining circle after removing \(\widehat{ML}\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(m\angle MPL = 65^\circ\).
  - \(NP \perp PL\), so \(m\angle NPL = 90^\circ\).

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Since \(NP \perp PL\), the arc \(\widehat{NL}\) is a semicircle, so \(m\widehat{NL} = 180^\circ\).
  - The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks for the measure of the arc \(\widehat{NM}\).
- To find \(m\widehat{NM}\), we need to use the given angle measures and the properties of circles.
- The key steps involve:
  1. Determining the measure of the arc \(\widehat{ML}\) using the central angle \(\angle MPL\).
  2. Using the fact that \(NP \perp PL\) to find the measure of arc \(\widehat{NL}\).
  3. Subtracting the measures of arcs \(\widehat{ML}\) and \(\widehat{LN}\) from the total circle to find \(m\widehat{NM}\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will cover:
  - The circle and its center.
  - The radii and their equality.
  - The perpendicular relationship between \(NP\) and \(PL\).
  - The measure of \(\angle MPL\).
  - The relationship between central angles and arcs.
