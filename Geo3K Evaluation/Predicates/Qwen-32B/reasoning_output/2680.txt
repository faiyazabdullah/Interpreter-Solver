REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a circle with center \( V \).
  - Four points \( R, S, T, U \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( RS, ST, TU, UR \) form a cyclic quadrilateral \( RSTU \).
  - Angles are marked at the intersections of the lines and the circle.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( \angle RUS = 92^\circ \)
  - \( \angle SUT = 51^\circ \)
  - The angle labeled \( \angle 4 \) is formed by lines \( RV \) and \( VS \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - None explicitly marked as right angles, parallel lines, or congruent segments.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( R, S, T, U \) are points on the circumference of the circle, making \( RSTU \) a cyclic quadrilateral.
  - The center of the circle is \( V \), so \( VR, VS, VT, VU \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( \angle 4 \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( RS \).
  - The central angle corresponding to arc \( RS \) is twice the measure of the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle RUS = 92^\circ \)
  - \( \angle SUT = 51^\circ \)

- **Determine Additional Relationships:**
  - The sum of the angles around point \( U \) is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore, we can find \( \angle RUT \):
    \[
    \angle RUT = 360^\circ - (\angle RUS + \angle SUT) = 360^\circ - (92^\circ + 51^\circ) = 217^\circ.
    \]
  - Since \( RSTU \) is a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to \( 180^\circ \). However, this is not directly needed to find \( \angle 4 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 4 \), which is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( RS \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.
  - To find \( \angle 4 \), we need the measure of the central angle \( \angle RVS \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, its center, and the points on the circumference.
  - Define the angles and their measures.
  - Capture the relationship between the inscribed angle and the central angle.
