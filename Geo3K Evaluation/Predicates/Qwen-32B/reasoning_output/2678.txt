REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a circle with center \( G \).
  - There are several points labeled: \( A, B, C, F, H, J \).
  - Lines are drawn connecting these points, forming segments and chords within the circle.

- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3 \).
  - \( \angle 2 \) is labeled as having measure \( 2x \).
  - \( \angle 3 \) is labeled as having measure \( x \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The lines \( BF \) and \( BH \) appear to be diameters of the circle, as they pass through the center \( G \).
  - No explicit right angles or other specific markings are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( BF \) and \( BH \) are diameters of the circle, so they are equal in length and both pass through the center \( G \).
  - \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are central angles subtended by arcs of the circle.
  - Since \( BF \) and \( BH \) are diameters, \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are likely related to the circle's properties.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The sum of the measures of the central angles around the center \( G \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are part of this total.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( m\angle 2 = 2x \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = x \)

- **Relationship Between Measures**:
  - Since \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are central angles, their measures are directly proportional to the arcs they subtend.
  - The problem provides the relationship \( m\angle 2 = 2x \) and \( m\angle 3 = x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The question asks to find \( m\angle 2 \) given \( m\angle 2 = 2x \) and \( m\angle 3 = x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The sum of the central angles around the center \( G \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Using the given relationships, we can express \( m\angle 2 \) in terms of \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Define the points and lines forming the diameters.
  - Define the angles and their measures.
  - Capture the relationships between the angles \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \).

- **Completeness Check**:
  - All visible information is captured.
  - Predicates are atomic and do not include derived solutions.
