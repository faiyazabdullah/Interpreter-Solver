### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Points**: The diagram contains several labeled points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q \).
- **Lines**: There are multiple lines intersecting and forming angles. Notable lines include:
  - Line \( q \) passing through points \( K \) and \( P \).
  - Line \( \beta \) passing through points \( M \) and \( O \).
  - Line \( c \) passing through points \( C \) and \( Q \).
  - Line \( d \) passing through points \( G \) and \( J \).
  - Other intersecting lines forming various angles.
- **Angles**: Several angles are labeled with numbers (e.g., \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \ldots, \angle 16 \)).
- **Special Markings**: The diagram uses triangular markings to indicate corresponding angles (likely indicating parallel lines and transversals).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Parallel Lines**: The triangular markings suggest that certain lines are parallel. Specifically:
  - Line \( q \) is parallel to line \( \beta \) (indicated by the corresponding angles \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \), \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 4 \)).
  - Line \( c \) is parallel to line \( d \) (indicated by the corresponding angles \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 11 \), \( \angle 10 \) and \( \angle 12 \)).
- **Transversals**: Lines intersecting the parallel lines act as transversals, creating corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles.
- **Corresponding Angles**: Angles such as \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \), \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 4 \), \( \angle 9 \) and \( \angle 11 \), \( \angle 10 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are corresponding angles.
- **Alternate Interior Angles**: Angles such as \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 5 \), \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \), \( \angle 10 \) and \( \angle 14 \), \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 15 \) are alternate interior angles.
- **Consecutive Interior Angles**: Angles such as \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 6 \), \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 5 \), \( \angle 10 \) and \( \angle 15 \), \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 14 \) are consecutive interior angles.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurement**: \( m\angle 3 = 43^\circ \).
- **Relationships**: Since \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are corresponding angles (due to the parallel lines \( c \parallel d \) and the transversal \( q \)), they are equal.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 11 \).
- From the analysis, \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 11 \) are corresponding angles. Corresponding angles are congruent when the lines are parallel.
- Therefore, \( m\angle 11 = m\angle 3 \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the relationships between the lines, angles, and the given measurement.
- The predicates should capture the parallelism of lines, the correspondence of angles, and the equality of corresponding angles.
