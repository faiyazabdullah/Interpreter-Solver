================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Three circles are shown: Circle(G), Circle(J), and Circle(K).
  - Points are labeled: G, H, J, K, L, B, C, D, F.
  - Circle(G) is the largest circle, containing smaller circles J and K.
  - Circle(J) and Circle(K) intersect at point L.
  - Circle(G) intersects Circle(J) at points G and D.
  - Circle(G) intersects Circle(K) at points G and C.
  - Lines are drawn connecting various points, such as GH, GL, JK, JL, KL, etc.

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations:**
  - GH = 10 (Given in the problem statement).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No explicit right angles, parallel lines, or congruence markings are visible.
  - The diagram suggests that points G, J, K, and L are significant intersection points of the circles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements:**
  - Circle(G), Circle(J), and Circle(K) intersect at point L.
  - Circle(G) contains Circle(J) and Circle(K), implying a concentric or overlapping configuration.
  - Points G, J, and K are centers of their respective circles.
  - GH is a segment from the center G to a point H on the circumference of Circle(G).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - Since Circle(G) is the largest circle, its radius determines the overall size.
  - GH = 10 implies that GH is a radius of Circle(G).
  - Circle(J) and Circle(K) share the point L, indicating they are tangent or intersecting at L.
  - The configuration suggests that Circle(J) and Circle(K) are smaller than Circle(G) and are possibly tangent to it at certain points.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - GH = 10 (Given).

- **What These Measurements Represent:**
  - GH represents the radius of Circle(G).
  - The problem does not provide explicit lengths for other segments like FJ, FK, or FL, so we must infer relationships.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks to find the length of FH, where H is a point on the circumference of Circle(G).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - Since GH is the radius of Circle(G), the distance from the center G to any point on the circumference (like H) is constant and equal to the radius.
  - To find FH, we need additional information about the position of F relative to G and H. However, the diagram does not provide explicit coordinates or additional distances.

- **Information Needed:**
  - The position of F relative to G and H.
  - Any relationships involving F, such as whether F lies on a specific line or circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the circles and their centers.
  - Indicate the intersections and tangencies.
  - Use the given measurement GH = 10.
  - Represent the relationships between points and circles.

- **Ensuring Completeness:**
  - Capture all visible geometric constraints and properties without assuming additional information not present in the diagram.
