REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are labeled as vertices of the triangle.
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( C \), indicating \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - \( AB \) is labeled as \( a \).
  - \( BC \) is labeled as \( b \).
  - \( AC \) is labeled as \( c \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( a = 14 \): The length of segment \( AB \).
  - \( b = 48 \): The length of segment \( BC \).
  - \( c = 50 \): The length of segment \( AC \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol at \( C \) indicates that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The sides satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The lengths of the sides are given as \( a = 14 \), \( b = 48 \), and \( c = 50 \).
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) can be used to find angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( a = 14 \): Length of the side opposite \( \angle C \) (leg \( AB \)).
  - \( b = 48 \): Length of the side adjacent to \( \angle A \) (leg \( BC \)).
  - \( c = 50 \): Length of the hypotenuse \( AC \).

- **Relationships:**
  - The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
  - For \( \angle A \):
    \[
    \sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{b}{c}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks to find \( \sin A \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - \( \sin A \) can be calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{b}{c}
    \]
  - Given \( b = 48 \) and \( c = 50 \), we can directly compute \( \sin A \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the triangle and its properties.
  - Specify the right angle and the relationships between the sides.
  - Include the given measurements.
  - Represent the trigonometric relationship for \( \sin A \).
