STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2564
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure consists of a rectangle and two circles inscribed within it.
  - The rectangle has vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D \).
  - Two circles are inscribed in the rectangle, with centers \( O \) and \( H \). These circles are tangent to the sides of the rectangle.
  - The shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the areas of the two circles.

- **Lines and Dimensions**:
  - The rectangle has dimensions \( 10 \, \text{cm} \) (width) and \( 5 \, \text{cm} \) (height).
  - The circles are tangent to the sides of the rectangle, meaning their diameters are equal to the width and height of the rectangle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings such as right angles or congruence symbols are visible. The focus is on the dimensions and the shaded region.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements**:
  - The circles are inscribed in the rectangle, meaning their diameters are equal to the dimensions of the rectangle.
  - The circles are tangent to the sides of the rectangle.
  - The shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the combined area of the two circles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - Width of the rectangle: \( 10 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Height of the rectangle: \( 5 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Diameter of the horizontal circle: \( 10 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Diameter of the vertical circle: \( 5 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Radius of the horizontal circle: \( 5 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Radius of the vertical circle: \( 2.5 \, \text{cm} \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The area of the rectangle: \( \text{Area}_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{width} \times \text{height} \).
  - The area of each circle: \( \text{Area}_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2 \).
  - The shaded region's area is the area of the rectangle minus the sum of the areas of the two circles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the rectangle and its dimensions.
  - Define the circles and their radii.
  - Relate the dimensions of the circles to the dimensions of the rectangle.
  - Capture the shaded region as the difference between the rectangle's area and the combined area of the circles.
