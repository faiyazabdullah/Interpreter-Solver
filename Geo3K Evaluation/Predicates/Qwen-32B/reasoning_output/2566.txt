QUESTION: Find the height of the parallelogram given its area with 2000 square units.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - The figure is a **parallelogram** with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - There is a vertical segment from point \( B \) to point \( E \) on line \( AD \), which represents the height of the parallelogram.
  
- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \).
  - Lines: \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( DA \), and \( BE \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The base of the parallelogram (\( BC \)) is labeled as \( x + 10 \).
  - The height of the parallelogram (\( BE \)) is labeled as \( x \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - There is a right angle symbol at \( \angle BEA \), indicating that \( BE \perp AD \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties:**
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \( AB \parallel CD \) and \( AD \parallel BC \).
  - Opposite sides are equal in length: \( AB = CD \) and \( AD = BC \).

- **Height and Base:**
  - The height \( BE \) is perpendicular to the base \( AD \).
  - The base \( AD \) is equal to the side \( BC \), so \( AD = x + 10 \).

- **Right Angle:**
  - \( BE \perp AD \) implies that \( \angle BEA \) is a right angle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - The height of the parallelogram is \( x \).
  - The base of the parallelogram is \( x + 10 \).
  - The area of the parallelogram is given as 2000 square units.

- **Relationships:**
  - The area of a parallelogram is given by the formula: 
    \[
    \text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
    \]
  - Here, the base is \( x + 10 \) and the height is \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the height of the parallelogram.
- We know the area of the parallelogram is 2000 square units.
- Using the area formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \implies 2000 = (x + 10) \cdot x
  \]
- Solving this equation will give us the value of \( x \), which is the height of the parallelogram.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- The predicates should capture the shape, measurements, and relationships without directly solving for the height.
