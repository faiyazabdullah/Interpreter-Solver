REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present with center \( L \).
  - Points \( G \), \( H \), \( J \), \( K \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( GK \), \( GH \), \( GJ \), \( KH \), and \( KJ \) are chords of the circle.
  - Point \( A \) lies on the circle's circumference.
  
- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - Angle \( \angle GKH = 97^\circ \).
  - Angle \( \angle GAH = 110^\circ \).
  - Angle \( \angle GXH = x^\circ \) (to be determined).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No special markings (e.g., right angles, parallel lines) are explicitly indicated.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Points \( G \), \( H \), \( J \), \( K \) are concyclic (all lie on the same circle).
  - Chords \( GK \), \( GH \), \( GJ \), \( KH \), and \( KJ \) intersect within the circle.
  - Angles subtended by the same arc are equal.
  - The central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The circle's properties (e.g., inscribed angles, central angles) will be used to relate the given angles to the unknown angle \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle GKH = 97^\circ \): This is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( GH \).
  - \( \angle GAH = 110^\circ \): This is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( GH \).
  - \( \angle GXH = x^\circ \): This is a central angle subtended by arc \( GH \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The central angle \( \angle GXH \) is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc \( GH \). This is a key property of circles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the measure of the central angle \( \angle GXH = x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.
  - The inscribed angle \( \angle GAH = 110^\circ \) is already given, so we can use it to find \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, its center, and points on the circumference.
  - Capture the relationships between inscribed and central angles.
  - Include the given angle measures and their relationships.
