================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The image contains multiple labeled points: \( L, M, N, T, G, C, B, P, E, D \).
- **Lines**: Several lines are drawn:
  - Lines \( \ell, m, n, t \) are labeled.
  - Line segments connect various points, forming intersections.
- **Angles**: Angles are labeled numerically from 1 to 12. Notably:
  - \( \angle 9 = 75^\circ \) is explicitly given.
  - Other angles are formed at intersection points.
- **Special Markings**: Right-angle symbols are present at certain intersections, indicating perpendicularity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**: Lines \( \ell, m, n \) appear parallel to each other.
- **Perpendicular Lines**: Some lines are perpendicular to others, as indicated by the right-angle symbols.
- **Intersections**: Points \( B, P, J \) are intersection points where lines meet.
- **Angles**: Angles are formed at these intersections, and their measures are related due to parallelism and perpendicularity.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**: \( \angle 9 = 75^\circ \).
- **Inferred Measurements**:
  - Since lines \( \ell, m, n \) are parallel, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles will have specific relationships.
  - Perpendicular lines create right angles (\( 90^\circ \)).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 6 \).
- To find \( \angle 6 \), we need to use the relationships between angles formed by parallel lines and transversals, as well as the given measurement \( \angle 9 = 75^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships between the lines and angles.
- Key relationships include:
  - Parallel lines and their corresponding angles.
  - Perpendicular lines creating right angles.
  - The given angle \( \angle 9 = 75^\circ \) and its implications for other angles.
