STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2423
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find A B if \triangle A B C is an isosceles triangle with A B \cong B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- **Points**: The vertices of the triangle are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the triangle are:
  - \( AB \) with length \( 2x - 7 \)
  - \( BC \) with length \( 4x - 21 \)
  - \( AC \) with length \( x - 3 \)
- **Annotations**: No additional markings such as right angles or parallel lines are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The problem states that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB \cong BC \). This implies that the lengths of \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal.
- The equality of \( AB \) and \( BC \) provides a constraint that can be used to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 2x - 7 \)
  - \( BC = 4x - 21 \)
  - \( AC = x - 3 \)
- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB \cong BC \), we have:
    \[
    AB = BC \implies 2x - 7 = 4x - 21
    \]
  - Solving this equation will give us the value of \( x \), which can then be used to find the lengths of \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AB \).
- To find \( AB \), we need to:
  1. Solve the equation \( 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \) to determine \( x \).
  2. Substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( AB \) to find its length.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the given information and relationships in the form of predicates.
- The key relationships are:
  - \( AB = 2x - 7 \)
  - \( BC = 4x - 21 \)
  - \( AC = x - 3 \)
  - \( AB \cong BC \) implies \( 2x - 7 = 4x - 21 \).
