REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a circle centered at point \( M \).
  - There are several points on the circumference: \( F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P \).
  - Line segments connect these points, forming chords within the circle.

- **Lines and Chords**:
  - \( FL \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( HJ \) is another chord of the circle.
  - \( HP \) is an arc of the circle.

- **Angles**:
  - There are right angles indicated at points \( L \) and \( N \). This suggests that \( ML \perp FL \) and \( MN \perp NJ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( FL = 24 \).
  - \( HJ = 48 \).
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \).

- **Other Observations**:
  - \( M \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( FG \) is a chord that needs to be determined.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties**:
  - \( M \) is the center, so \( ML \) and \( MN \) are radii of the circle.
  - Since \( ML \perp FL \) and \( MN \perp NJ \), \( L \) and \( N \) are midpoints of chords \( FL \) and \( NJ \), respectively.

- **Chord Properties**:
  - The perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord.
  - Therefore, \( FL \) is bisected at \( L \), and \( HJ \) is bisected at its midpoint.

- **Arc and Central Angle**:
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \) implies that the central angle \( \angle HMP \) subtending arc \( \widehat{HP} \) is also \( 65^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( FL = 24 \): The length of chord \( FL \).
  - \( HJ = 48 \): The length of chord \( HJ \).
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \): The measure of the arc \( \widehat{HP} \).

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \( ML \perp FL \), \( L \) is the midpoint of \( FL \). Thus, \( FL \) is split into two equal segments, each of length 12.
  - Similarly, since \( MN \perp NJ \), \( N \) is the midpoint of \( HJ \). Thus, \( HJ \) is split into two equal segments, each of length 24.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of \( FG \).
- To solve this, we need to use the properties of the circle, such as the relationships between chords, arcs, and central angles.
- The key is to leverage the given information about the lengths of \( FL \) and \( HJ \), as well as the arc \( \widehat{HP} \), to determine the radius of the circle and then use it to find \( FG \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates will include the circle, its center, chords, radii, perpendicularity, and the given measurements.
- The goal is to ensure all visible relationships are captured without directly solving for \( FG \).
