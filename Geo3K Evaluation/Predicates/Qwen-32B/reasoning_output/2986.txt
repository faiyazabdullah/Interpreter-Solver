================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present.
  - Points labeled: \( S, T, R, U \).
  - Lines:
    - \( ST \) is tangent to the circle at point \( T \).
    - \( SR \) is tangent to the circle at point \( R \).
    - \( SU \) is a secant line intersecting the circle at points \( T \) and \( U \).
  - Measurements:
    - \( ST = 5 \).
    - \( SR = 9 \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( ST \) and \( SR \) are tangents from the external point \( S \) to the circle.
  - \( SU \) is a secant line.
  - Since \( ST \) and \( SR \) are tangents from the same external point \( S \), they are equal in length according to the tangent-tangent theorem.
  - However, the problem states \( ST = 5 \) and \( SR = 9 \), indicating a discrepancy. Assuming the diagram's visual representation is correct, we infer that the secant intersects the circle at two points, and the segment lengths must be analyzed using the Power of a Point theorem.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( ST = 5 \): Length of the tangent segment from \( S \) to the point of tangency \( T \).
  - \( SR = 9 \): Length of the tangent segment from \( S \) to the point of tangency \( R \).
  - The secant \( SU \) intersects the circle at points \( T \) and \( U \). Let \( TU = x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length \( x \) of the segment \( TU \) to the nearest tenth.
- To solve this, we use the **Power of a Point theorem**, which states that for a secant-segment configuration:
  \[
  ST^2 = SR \cdot (SR + RU)
  \]
  where \( ST \) is the tangent segment, \( SR \) is part of the secant, and \( RU \) is the remaining part of the secant inside the circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The key relationships involve the tangent-secant configuration and the application of the Power of a Point theorem.
