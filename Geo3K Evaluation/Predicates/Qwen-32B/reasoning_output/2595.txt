REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - Two circles are shown:
    - Circle \( S \) (larger circle) with diameter \( DB \).
    - Circle \( R \) (smaller circle) with diameter \( RC \).
  - Points \( R, C, D, S, B \) are labeled.
  - Line segments \( DS \) and \( RC \) are diameters of their respective circles.
  - Point \( D \) lies on both circles, indicating it is a common point.
  - Point \( C \) lies on the smaller circle \( R \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - Diameter of \( \odot S \): 30 units.
  - Diameter of \( \odot R \): 20 units.
  - Length \( DS = 9 \) units.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence indicators are present.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Circle Properties:**
  - \( DS \) is the diameter of \( \odot S \), so \( S \) is the center of \( \odot S \).
  - \( RC \) is the diameter of \( \odot R \), so \( R \) is the center of \( \odot R \).
  - Since \( D \) lies on both circles, it is equidistant from both centers \( S \) and \( R \) along the radii.

- **Key Relationships:**
  - The radius of \( \odot S \) is half its diameter: \( \text{Radius of } \odot S = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
  - The radius of \( \odot R \) is half its diameter: \( \text{Radius of } \odot R = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \).
  - Since \( D \) is a common point, the distance \( SD \) is the radius of \( \odot S \), and \( RD \) is the radius of \( \odot R \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Diameter of \( \odot S \): 30 units → Radius of \( \odot S \): 15 units.
  - Diameter of \( \odot R \): 20 units → Radius of \( \odot R \): 10 units.
  - Distance \( DS = 9 \) units.

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( S \) is the center of \( \odot S \), \( SD = 15 \) units (radius of \( \odot S \)).
  - Since \( R \) is the center of \( \odot R \), \( RD \) is part of the radius of \( \odot R \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What is asked:**
  - Find the length \( RC \), which is the diameter of \( \odot R \).

- **Relevant Information:**
  - The diameter of \( \odot R \) is given as 20 units.
  - The problem involves understanding the relative positions of points \( R, C, D, S \) and leveraging the given distances and diameters.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates to Capture Relationships:**
  - Define the circles and their centers.
  - Specify the diameters and radii.
  - Indicate the distances between key points.
  - Ensure all given measurements and relationships are represented.
