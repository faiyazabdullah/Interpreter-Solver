STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2898
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- The image depicts a composite geometric figure consisting of:
  - A rectangle with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D \).
  - Two semicircles attached to the top and bottom sides of the rectangle.
  - The top semicircle is attached at points \( D \) and \( E \).
  - The bottom semicircle is attached at points \( E \) and \( F \).
- Visible measurements:
  - The width of the rectangle (distance between \( A \) and \( B \)) is \( 8 \) units.
  - The height of the rectangle (distance between \( A \) and \( E \)) is \( 3 \) units.
- Special markings:
  - A right angle symbol indicates that the rectangle's sides are perpendicular to each other.
  - The semicircles have diameters equal to the width of the rectangle.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Shapes:**
  - The main shape is a combination of a rectangle and two semicircles.
  - The rectangle has vertices \( A, B, C, D \).
  - The top semicircle is inscribed above the rectangle, with its diameter along \( DE \).
  - The bottom semicircle is inscribed below the rectangle, with its diameter along \( EF \).
- **Relationships:**
  - The diameters of the semicircles are equal to the width of the rectangle (\( AB = 8 \)).
  - The height of the rectangle (\( AE = 3 \)) is the same as the vertical distance between the centers of the semicircles.
  - The figure is symmetric about the vertical axis passing through the center of the rectangle.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Rectangle:**
  - Width (\( AB \)) = \( 8 \) units.
  - Height (\( AE \)) = \( 3 \) units.
- **Semicircles:**
  - Diameter of each semicircle = \( 8 \) units.
  - Radius of each semicircle = \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) units.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the **area** of the entire figure.
- To find the total area, we need to calculate:
  1. The area of the rectangle.
  2. The area of the two semicircles.
  3. Sum these areas to get the total area of the composite figure.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements using predicates.
- Predicates should cover:
  - The shapes (rectangle and semicircles).
  - The dimensions of the rectangle and semicircles.
  - The relationships between the shapes (e.g., the semicircles being attached to the rectangle).
