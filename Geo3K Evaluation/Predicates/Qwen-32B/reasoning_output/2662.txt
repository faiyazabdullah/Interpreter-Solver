REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is present with center \( L \).
  - Points \( H, I, J, K, G \) are marked on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( HK \) and \( IG \) are drawn through the center \( L \), indicating they are diameters of the circle.
  - A right angle is marked at point \( L \) where the diameters intersect.

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations**:
  - The arc \( \widehat{IH} \) is labeled with a measure of \( 59^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The intersection of diameters \( HK \) and \( IG \) forms a right angle at \( L \).
  - The circle is symmetric, and the diameters divide it into four equal quadrants.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( HK \) and \( IG \) are diameters of the circle, passing through the center \( L \).
  - The diameters are perpendicular to each other because they form a right angle at \( L \).
  - The circle is symmetric, and the diameters divide it into four equal quadrants.
  - Arcs subtended by diameters are semicircles, and arcs subtended by radii are related to central angles.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{IH} \) is part of the circle and has a measure of \( 59^\circ \).
  - Since \( HK \) and \( IG \) are diameters, they divide the circle into quadrants, each measuring \( 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{IH} \) is \( 59^\circ \).
  - The diameters \( HK \) and \( IG \) divide the circle into four equal quadrants, each \( 90^\circ \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) spans from point \( I \) to point \( J \) through point \( H \). To find its measure, we need to determine the full arc from \( I \) to \( J \) and subtract the arc \( \widehat{IH} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks for the measure of the arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) is part of the circle and can be calculated using the properties of the circle and the given arc \( \widehat{IH} \).
  - Since \( HK \) and \( IG \) are diameters, the arc \( \widehat{IJ} \) is a semicircle, which measures \( 180^\circ \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) is the portion of the semicircle \( \widehat{IJ} \) excluding the arc \( \widehat{IH} \).

- **Information Needed**:
  - The measure of the arc \( \widehat{IJ} \) (semicircle).
  - The measure of the arc \( \widehat{IH} \) (given as \( 59^\circ \)).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Indicate that \( HK \) and \( IG \) are diameters.
  - Specify the right angle formed by the diameters.
  - State the measure of arc \( \widehat{IH} \).
  - Relate the arc \( \widehat{IHJ} \) to the semicircle \( \widehat{IJ} \).
