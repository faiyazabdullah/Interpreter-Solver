REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a circle with center \( C \).
  - Points \( E, F, G, H \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Chords \( EF \) and \( HG \) are drawn inside the circle.

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments \( EF \) and \( HG \) are chords of the circle.
  - The lengths of the chords are given as expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( EF = 8x + 6 \)
    - \( FG = 10x - 4 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - There are no additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence indicators.
  - The problem appears to focus on the lengths of the chords.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Both \( EF \) and \( FG \) are chords of the same circle.
  - Since no additional geometric properties (e.g., perpendicularity, symmetry) are indicated, we assume the chords are simply intersecting or non-intersecting within the circle.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The problem does not specify any additional constraints beyond the given lengths of the chords.
  - The goal is to find the value of \( x \) based on the given expressions for the chord lengths.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - The lengths of the chords are expressed as:
    - \( EF = 8x + 6 \)
    - \( FG = 10x - 4 \)
  - These expressions suggest that the problem may involve setting up an equation based on the equality or some relationship between the two chord lengths.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
  - To solve for \( x \), we need to establish a relationship between the given expressions for the chord lengths.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - Since no additional geometric relationships are provided (e.g., equal chords, intersecting chords), the most straightforward approach is to assume the lengths of the chords are equal or use another logical relationship based on the problem context.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle and its center.
  - Represent the points on the circumference.
  - Represent the chords and their lengths.
  - Establish the relationship between the chord lengths (e.g., equality or another constraint).

- **Completeness Check:**
  - All visible information from the diagram is captured.
  - The predicates will allow another system to solve for \( x \) based on the given relationships.
