REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - There is a right triangle \(ABD\) with right angle at \(D\).
  - There is a right triangle \(BCD\) with right angle at \(D\).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the quadrilateral.
  - Line segment \(BD\) is shared by both right triangles \(ABD\) and \(BCD\).
  - Line segment \(AD\) is one side of triangle \(ABD\).
  - Line segment \(CD\) is one side of triangle \(BCD\).

- **Measurements:**
  - \(AB = 8.8\) units.
  - \(BC = 8.5\) units.
  - The right angle is marked at point \(D\).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at point \(D\) for both triangles \(ABD\) and \(BCD\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Triangles \(ABD\) and \(BCD\) are right triangles with the right angle at \(D\).
  - Line segment \(BD\) is the common leg of both right triangles.
  - Line segment \(AD\) is the hypotenuse of triangle \(ABD\).
  - Line segment \(CD\) is the hypotenuse of triangle \(BCD\).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - Since \(D\) is the right angle, \(BD\) is perpendicular to both \(AD\) and \(CD\).
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to both right triangles:
    - For \(\triangle ABD\): \(AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\).
    - For \(\triangle BCD\): \(BC^2 = CD^2 + BD^2\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \(AB = 8.8\) units.
  - \(BC = 8.5\) units.
  - \(BD\) is a shared leg of both right triangles and is unknown.
  - \(AD\) and \(CD\) are unknown but can be expressed in terms of \(BD\).

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem:
    - In \(\triangle ABD\): \(8.8^2 = AD^2 + BD^2\).
    - In \(\triangle BCD\): \(8.5^2 = CD^2 + BD^2\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the value of \(x\), which represents the length of \(CD\).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The right triangles \(ABD\) and \(BCD\) share the leg \(BD\).
  - The Pythagorean theorem will be used to express the relationships between the sides of the triangles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the points, lines, and angles.
  - Indicate the right angles and the right triangles.
  - Specify the lengths of known segments.
  - Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides of the triangles.
