STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2497
================================================================================
QUESTION: In H, the diameter is 18, L M = 12, and m \widehat L M = 84. Find H P. Round to the nearest hundredth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present with center \( H \).
  - Points \( J, K, L, M, P \) are marked on or around the circle.
  - Lines are drawn connecting these points:
    - \( JH \) and \( HK \) appear to be radii of the circle.
    - \( LP \) is a vertical line segment.
    - \( PM \) is a horizontal line segment.
    - \( LM \) is a chord of the circle.
  - Angles are marked:
    - \( \angle LPM \) is a right angle (indicated by the red square).
    - \( \widehat{LM} \) is an arc of the circle subtended by chord \( LM \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - Diameter of the circle is given as 18.
  - Length of \( LM \) is given as 12.
  - Measure of arc \( \widehat{LM} \) is given as \( 84^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols indicate \( \angle LPM \) is \( 90^\circ \).
  - The center of the circle is labeled \( H \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( H \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( JH \) and \( HK \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( LP \) and \( PM \) form a right triangle \( LPM \) with \( \angle LPM = 90^\circ \).
  - \( LM \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( \widehat{LM} \) is an arc subtended by the chord \( LM \), and its measure is \( 84^\circ \).
  - The radius \( HP \) is part of the right triangle \( LPM \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The diameter of the circle is 18, so the radius \( r \) is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
  - The right triangle \( LPM \) has \( LM \) as the hypotenuse, and \( LP \) and \( PM \) as legs.
  - The arc \( \widehat{LM} \) and the chord \( LM \) are related through the central angle subtending the arc.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Diameter of the circle: 18.
  - Length of \( LM \): 12.
  - Measure of arc \( \widehat{LM} \): \( 84^\circ \).

- **Interpretation of Measurements:**
  - The radius \( r \) of the circle is \( 9 \) (since diameter = 18).
  - The chord \( LM \) has a length of 12.
  - The arc \( \widehat{LM} \) subtends a central angle of \( 84^\circ \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What is Asked:**
  - Find the length of \( HP \), where \( P \) is the foot of the perpendicular from the center \( H \) to the chord \( LM \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - In a circle, the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord.
  - The right triangle \( LPM \) can be used to find \( LP \) and \( PM \).
  - The radius \( HP \) is one of the legs of the right triangle \( LPM \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle, its center, and radius.
  - Define the chord \( LM \) and its length.
  - Define the arc \( \widehat{LM} \) and its measure.
  - Define the right triangle \( LPM \) and its properties.
  - Relate the radius \( HP \) to the right triangle and the chord.
