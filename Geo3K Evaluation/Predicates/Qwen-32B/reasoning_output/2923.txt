### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - The right angle is at vertex \( A \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AB \) is one side of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is another side of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The segment \( AB \) has a length of 2 units.
  - The segment \( BC \) has a length of 5 units.

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol is present at vertex \( A \), indicating \( \angle CAB = 90^\circ \).
  - The hypotenuse \( BC \) is labeled with its length (5 units).
  - The side \( AB \) is labeled with its length (2 units).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - \( AB \) and \( AC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) are perpendicular to each other.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.
  - The relationship between the sides is given by \( AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AB = 2 \) units.
  - \( BC = 5 \) units.
  - \( AC \) is the unknown side, denoted as \( x \).

- **What Measurements Represent**:
  - \( AB \): One leg of the right triangle.
  - \( BC \): The hypotenuse of the right triangle.
  - \( AC \): The other leg of the right triangle, which we need to find.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of the side \( AC \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  2^2 + x^2 = 5^2
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  4 + x^2 = 25
  \]
  Solving for \( x \):
  \[
  x^2 = 21 \implies x = \sqrt{21}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The predicates should capture the structure of the triangle, the right angle, the lengths of the sides, and the relationships between them.
