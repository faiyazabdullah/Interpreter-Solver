QUESTION: Find z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains two triangles: ΔABC and ΔABD.
  - Points labeled: A, B, C, D.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments: AB, BC, AD, BD, AC.
  
- **Angles:**
  - Right angles are marked at ∠ADB and ∠ABC.
  
- **Measurements:**
  - AD = 3.
  - BD = x.
  - BC = 12.
  - AB is the shared side between both triangles.
  - z represents the length of segment AB.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles:**
  - ΔABD is a right triangle with the right angle at D.
  - ΔABC is a right triangle with the right angle at B.
  
- **Perpendicular Lines:**
  - Line AD is perpendicular to line BD.
  - Line AB is perpendicular to line BC.
  
- **Shared Side:**
  - Segment AB is common to both triangles ΔABD and ΔABC.
  
- **Relationships:**
  - Since ΔABD and ΔABC share the side AB, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in both triangles to establish relationships.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Known Measurements:**
  - AD = 3 (leg of ΔABD).
  - BD = x (other leg of ΔABD).
  - BC = 12 (one leg of ΔABC).
  - AB = z (hypotenuse of ΔABD and one leg of ΔABC).
  
- **Unknowns:**
  - The value of z (length of AB).
  - The value of x (length of BD).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( z \), the length of segment AB.
- To find \( z \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem in both triangles:
  - In ΔABD: \( AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 \).
  - In ΔABC: \( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \).
- However, since the problem does not ask for \( AC \) or \( x \), we focus on solving for \( z \) using ΔABD.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will include definitions of shapes, angles, lengths, and relationships like perpendicularity and right angles.
