REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains a right triangle \( \triangle PMN \).
  - Points \( P \), \( M \), and \( N \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - The right angle is marked at point \( P \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \( PM \) is one leg of the triangle with length 36.
  - \( PN \) is the other leg of the triangle with length 15.
  - \( MN \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle with length 39.

- **Special Markings**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at \( \angle P \), indicating that \( \angle P \) is a right angle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle PMN \) is a right triangle because it has a right angle at \( P \).
  - \( PM \) and \( PN \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( MN \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies: \( PM^2 + PN^2 = MN^2 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( PM = 36 \)
  - \( PN = 15 \)
  - \( MN = 39 \)

- **Implications**:
  - The lengths satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: \( 36^2 + 15^2 = 39^2 \).
  - This confirms that \( \triangle PMN \) is indeed a right triangle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The question asks for the ratio of \( \sin N \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - In a right triangle, \( \sin \) of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
  - For \( \angle N \):
    - The side opposite \( \angle N \) is \( PM \).
    - The hypotenuse is \( MN \).

- **Formula**:
  \[
  \sin N = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{PM}{MN}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the triangle and its properties.
  - Specify the right angle.
  - Provide the measurements of the sides.
  - Relate the sides to the trigonometric function \( \sin N \).
