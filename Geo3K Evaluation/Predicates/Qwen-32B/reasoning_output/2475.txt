================================================================================
QUESTION: If m \angle 5 = 7 x - 5 and m \angle 4 = 2 x + 23, find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The image contains several labeled points: \( G, H, A, B, C, D, E, F \).
- **Lines**: There are two lines labeled \( p \) and \( m \). Additionally, there are intersecting lines forming angles.
- **Angles**: Angles are numbered from 1 to 8. Specifically:
  - \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of lines.
  - \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are supplementary because they form a linear pair.
- **Special Markings**: There are no explicit right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks visible in the image.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Supplementary Angles**: Since \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) form a linear pair, they are supplementary. This means:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle 4 + \text{Measure of } \angle 5 = 180^\circ
  \]
- **Given Information**: 
  - \( \text{Measure of } \angle 5 = 7x - 5 \)
  - \( \text{Measure of } \angle 4 = 2x + 23 \)

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The problem provides expressions for the measures of \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \):
  - \( m\angle 5 = 7x - 5 \)
  - \( m\angle 4 = 2x + 23 \)
- These expressions are used to determine the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \) given the expressions for \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \).
- Since \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are supplementary, we use the relationship:
  \[
  m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substituting the given expressions:
  \[
  (2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- The key relationship here is the supplementary nature of \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \).
- The predicates will capture the definitions of the angles, their measures, and the supplementary relationship.
