REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is present.
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Sides:**
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - \( AB \) is labeled as \( y \).
  - \( BC \) is labeled as \( 14\sqrt{3} \).
  - \( AC \) is labeled as \( x \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle (marked with a right angle symbol).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \), so \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \)).
  - \( BC \) is one of the legs of the right triangle, and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( BC \)) is half the length of the hypotenuse (\( AC \)) in a 30-60-90 triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 14\sqrt{3} \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

- **Derived Information:**
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the sides is:
    - Opposite \( 30^\circ \): \( BC = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{2} \).
    - Opposite \( 60^\circ \): \( AB = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \times \text{hypotenuse} \).
    - Hypotenuse: \( AC = 2 \times \text{opposite } 30^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the length of \( AC \).
- To find \( x \), we use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:
  - Since \( BC \) is the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle, \( AC = 2 \times BC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, angles, and relationships.
- Include the given measurements and the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle.
- Ensure all visible information is captured without directly solving for \( x \).
