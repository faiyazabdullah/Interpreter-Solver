REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present with center \( O \) (not explicitly labeled but implied).
  - A secant line \( MC \) intersects the circle at points \( B \) and \( C \).
  - A tangent line from point \( M \) touches the circle at point \( A \).
  - Points \( M \), \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( P \) are marked.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( MA \) is a tangent segment with length 10.
  - \( MB \) is part of the secant line, and its length is denoted as \( y \).
  - \( BC \) is a chord of the circle with length 6.
  
- **Measurements:**
  - \( MA = 10 \)
  - \( BC = 6 \)
  - \( MB = y \) (to be determined).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( MA \) is tangent to the circle at \( A \).
  - \( MC \) is a secant intersecting the circle at \( B \) and \( C \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The Power of a Point theorem applies here because \( M \) is an external point relative to the circle.
  - The tangent-secant case of the Power of a Point theorem states:
    \[
    MA^2 = MB \cdot MC
    \]
  - \( MA \) is tangent to the circle, and \( MC \) is the full secant segment.

- **Constraints:**
  - \( MA = 10 \)
  - \( MB = y \)
  - \( BC = 6 \), so \( MC = MB + BC = y + 6 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( MA = 10 \)
  - \( BC = 6 \)
  - \( MB = y \)
  - \( MC = MB + BC = y + 6 \).

- **Relationships:**
  - The Power of a Point theorem relates the tangent segment \( MA \) to the secant segments \( MB \) and \( MC \):
    \[
    MA^2 = MB \cdot MC
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    10^2 = y \cdot (y + 6)
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \), the length of segment \( MB \).
- To find \( y \), we use the equation derived from the Power of a Point theorem:
  \[
  10^2 = y(y + 6)
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  100 = y^2 + 6y
  \]
  Rearrange into standard quadratic form:
  \[
  y^2 + 6y - 100 = 0
  \]
- Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
  \[
  y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]
  where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 6 \), and \( c = -100 \):
  \[
  y = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{6^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-100)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 + 400}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{436}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 2\sqrt{109}}{2} = -3 \pm \sqrt{109}
  \]
- Since \( y \) represents a length, it must be positive:
  \[
  y = -3 + \sqrt{109}
  \]
- Approximating \( \sqrt{109} \approx 10.44 \):
  \[
  y \approx -3 + 10.44 = 7.44
  \]
- Rounded to the nearest tenth:
  \[
  y \approx 7.4
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints without solving the problem directly.
- The key relationships involve the Power of a Point theorem and the lengths of the segments.
