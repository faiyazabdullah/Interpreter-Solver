================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a vertical line segment from point \( B \) to point \( D \) on \( AC \), forming two right triangles: \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle CBD \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( AC \) (indicated by the right angle symbol at \( D \)).
  - \( AC \) is divided into segments \( AD \) and \( DC \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BAD = 55^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CAD = 47^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ \) (right angle).
  - \( \angle CDB = 90^\circ \) (right angle).

- **Measurements:**
  - The length of segment \( CD \) is given as 12 units.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Right Triangles:**
  - \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle CBD \) are right triangles because \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( AC \).
  - \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle CDB = 90^\circ \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - In \( \triangle ABD \):
    - \( \angle BAD = 55^\circ \).
    - \( \angle ABD = 90^\circ - 55^\circ = 35^\circ \).
  - In \( \triangle CBD \):
    - \( \angle CAD = 47^\circ \).
    - \( \angle CBD = 90^\circ - 47^\circ = 43^\circ \).

- **Segment Relationships:**
  - \( AC = AD + DC \).
  - \( DC = 12 \) units.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( CD = 12 \) units.
  - \( \angle BAD = 55^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CAD = 47^\circ \).

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Since \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( AC \), we can use trigonometric relationships in the right triangles \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle CBD \) to find the lengths of segments and angles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( y \), which corresponds to the hypotenuse \( AB \) of \( \triangle ABD \).
- To find \( y \), we need to determine the lengths of \( AD \) and \( BD \) using the given angles and the length of \( CD \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all visible geometric shapes, lines, angles, and relationships.
- Use trigonometric relationships to express the connections between the sides and angles without directly solving for \( y \).
