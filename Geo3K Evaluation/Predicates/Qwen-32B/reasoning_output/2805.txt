REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle \(\odot O\) with center \(O\).
  - Points \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines connecting points form various segments and diameters.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \(E C\) and \(A B\) are labeled as diameters.
  - Angles \(\angle B O D\), \(\angle D O E\), \(\angle E O F\), and \(\angle F O A\) are marked as congruent.
  - Right angle symbols indicate perpendicularity at certain intersections.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The circle is divided into equal angular sections by the radii.
  - The diameters \(E C\) and \(A B\) intersect at the center \(O\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \(E C\) and \(A B\) are diameters, so they pass through the center \(O\) and are perpendicular to each other.
  - Since the circle is divided into equal angular sections, each central angle (\(\angle B O D\), \(\angle D O E\), \(\angle E O F\), \(\angle F O A\)) measures \(90^\circ / 4 = 22.5^\circ\).
  - The arcs subtended by these central angles are also equal in measure.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The circle is symmetric, and the diameters divide it into four quadrants.
  - The central angles sum up to \(360^\circ\), and since they are congruent, each measures \(90^\circ / 4 = 22.5^\circ\).
  - The arc lengths corresponding to these central angles are proportional to the central angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Each central angle (\(\angle B O D\), \(\angle D O E\), \(\angle E O F\), \(\angle F O A\)) measures \(22.5^\circ\).
  - The total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since the circle is divided into eight equal angular sections (four central angles of \(22.5^\circ\) each), the arc \(\widehat{A E}\) spans two of these sections.
  - Therefore, the measure of \(\widehat{A E}\) is \(2 \times 22.5^\circ = 45^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - Find the measure of the arc \(\widehat{A E}\).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its corresponding central angle.
  - Since \(\widehat{A E}\) spans two central angles of \(22.5^\circ\) each, its measure is \(45^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify the diameters and their properties.
  - Indicate the congruence of central angles.
  - Relate the arc \(\widehat{A E}\) to the central angles.

- **Completeness Check:**
  - All visible relationships and constraints are captured.
  - The predicates will allow another system to deduce the measure of \(\widehat{A E}\) without directly stating the final answer.
