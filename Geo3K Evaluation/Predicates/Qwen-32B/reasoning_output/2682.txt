================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure is a parallelogram \(ABCD\).
  - There is a dashed line segment \(DE\) drawn from \(D\) perpendicular to \(BC\), indicating it is the height of the parallelogram.

- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(E\).
  - Lines: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DA\), and \(DE\).

- **Measurements**:
  - Side \(AB = 20 \, \text{cm}\).
  - Side \(BC = 12 \, \text{cm}\).
  - Angle \(\angle ABC = 60^\circ\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The dashed line \(DE\) indicates the height of the parallelogram.
  - The right-angle symbol at \(E\) confirms that \(DE\) is perpendicular to \(BC\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\).
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).

- **Height and Base**:
  - The height \(DE\) is perpendicular to the base \(BC\).
  - The height can be calculated using trigonometry since \(\angle ABC = 60^\circ\).

- **Right Triangle Formation**:
  - The height \(DE\) forms a right triangle \(\triangle DBE\) with \(DB\) as the hypotenuse and \(BE\) as part of the base \(BC\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 20 \, \text{cm}\) (one side of the parallelogram).
  - \(BC = 12 \, \text{cm}\) (base of the parallelogram).
  - \(\angle ABC = 60^\circ\).

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - The height \(DE\) can be found using the sine of \(\angle ABC\):
    \[
    DE = AB \cdot \sin(60^\circ) = 20 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 10\sqrt{3} \, \text{cm}.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- The formula for the area of a parallelogram is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}.
  \]
- Here, the base is \(BC = 12 \, \text{cm}\) and the height is \(DE = 10\sqrt{3} \, \text{cm}\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The predicates should cover the parallelogram, its sides, angles, height, and the relationships between them.
