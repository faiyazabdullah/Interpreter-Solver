REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a quadrilateral labeled \(WXYZ\).
  - The quadrilateral is identified as a parallelogram.
  - Points \(W, X, Y, Z\) are the vertices of the parallelogram.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \(WX = 24\)
  - \(ZY = 28\)
  - \(WZ\) and \(XY\) are the other sides of the parallelogram, but their lengths are not explicitly given.
  
- **Angles:**
  - \(\angle W = 105^\circ\) is labeled at vertex \(W\).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence are explicitly shown beyond the identification of the parallelogram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Parallelogram:**
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel: \(WX = YZ\) and \(WZ = XY\).
  - Opposite angles are equal: \(\angle W = \angle Y\) and \(\angle X = \angle Z\).
  - Consecutive angles are supplementary: \(\angle W + \angle X = 180^\circ\), \(\angle X + \angle Y = 180^\circ\), etc.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(WX = 24\)
  - \(ZY = 28\)
  - \(\angle W = 105^\circ\)

- **Inferred Measurements:**
  - Since \(WXYZ\) is a parallelogram:
    - \(YZ = WX = 24\)
    - \(WZ = XY = 28\)
  - Using the property of consecutive angles being supplementary:
    - \(\angle X = 180^\circ - \angle W = 180^\circ - 105^\circ = 75^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m \angle XYZ\).
- From the properties of a parallelogram:
  - \(\angle XYZ\) is the same as \(\angle W\) because opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal.
  - Therefore, \(\angle XYZ = \angle W = 105^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the properties of the parallelogram, the given measurements, and the relationships between angles and sides.
