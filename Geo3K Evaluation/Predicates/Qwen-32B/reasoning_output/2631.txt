STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2631
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that a \parallel b.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
- **Lines**: 
  - Line \(a\) passes through points D and G.
  - Line \(b\) passes through points E and C.
  - Line segment GH passes through points G and H.
  - Line segments BD, BE, AF, and AC are shown.
- **Angles**: 
  - \(\angle DBE = (4x + 11)^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BAC = (8x + 1)\)
  - These angles are formed by the intersection of lines \(a\) and \(b\) with line segment GH.
- **Special Markings**: 
  - Lines \(a\) and \(b\) are labeled separately, suggesting they may be related in some way (e.g., parallel).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelism**: The question asks us to find \(x\) such that \(a \parallel b\). For two lines to be parallel, the corresponding angles formed by a transversal must be equal.
- **Transversal**: Line segment GH acts as a transversal intersecting lines \(a\) and \(b\).
- **Corresponding Angles**: The angles \(\angle DBE\) and \(\angle BAC\) are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal GH and above lines \(a\) and \(b\), respectively.
- **Equality of Corresponding Angles**: For \(a \parallel b\), we need \(\angle DBE = \angle BAC\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of \(\angle DBE\) is given as \((4x + 11)^\circ\).
- The measure of \(\angle BAC\) is given as \((8x + 1)^\circ\).
- These are algebraic expressions involving the variable \(x\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem requires finding the value of \(x\) such that lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel.
- For \(a \parallel b\), the corresponding angles \(\angle DBE\) and \(\angle BAC\) must be equal.
- This leads to the equation:
  \[
  4x + 11 = 8x + 1
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The key relationship is that for \(a \parallel b\), the corresponding angles must be equal.
- We will use predicates to express the equality of these angles and their measures.
