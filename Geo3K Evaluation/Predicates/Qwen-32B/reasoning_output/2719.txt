### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- **Lines**: 
  - Line \( p \) passes through points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
  - Line \( q \) passes through points \( I, J, K, L, M, N, O \).
  - Line \( r \) passes through points \( G, H \).
- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle B \) is labeled as \( y^\circ \).
  - \( \angle C \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).
  - \( \angle F \) is labeled as \( (2x + 15)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle A \) is labeled as \( (3x - 60)^\circ \).
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle BCD \) and \( \angle EFG \).
  - Parallel lines are marked between \( p \) and \( q \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - Line \( p \) is parallel to line \( q \) (\( p \parallel q \)).
- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle BCD \) and \( \angle EFG \) are right angles.
- **Transversals**:
  - Line \( r \) acts as a transversal intersecting lines \( p \) and \( q \).
- **Corresponding Angles**:
  - Since \( p \parallel q \), corresponding angles formed by the transversal are equal.
- **Supplementary Angles**:
  - Angles on a straight line sum to \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle A = (3x - 60)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle F = (2x + 15)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = y^\circ \)
  - \( \angle C = x^\circ \)
- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle BCD = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle EFG = 90^\circ \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( m\angle FCE \).
- To find \( m\angle FCE \), we need to use the properties of parallel lines, right angles, and the relationships between angles formed by transversals.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the geometric relationships and constraints using the provided guidelines.
- Ensure all visible information is captured in atomic predicates.
