REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image contains triangles, specifically \(\triangle DEF\) and \(\triangle CBF\).
  - Key points: \(A, B, C, D, E, F\).
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines connecting the points form the sides of the triangles.
  - Specific segments are labeled: \(DF = 6\), \(FC = 8\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The triangles appear to share certain proportional relationships, as indicated by the problem statement (\(\triangle DEF \sim \triangle CBF\)).
  - No explicit right angles or other specific angle measures are marked.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similar Triangles**:
  - The problem states that \(\triangle DEF \sim \triangle CBF\). This implies corresponding sides are proportional, and corresponding angles are equal.
  
- **Proportional Sides**:
  - Since \(DF\) and \(FC\) are given, we can use the similarity ratio to relate the sides of \(\triangle DEF\) to those of \(\triangle CBF\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - Perimeter of \(\triangle CBF = 27\).
  - \(DF = 6\).
  - \(FC = 8\).

- **Implications**:
  - The perimeter of \(\triangle CBF\) is the sum of its three sides.
  - Using the similarity ratio, we can determine the scale factor between \(\triangle DEF\) and \(\triangle CBF\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Goal**: Find the perimeter of \(\triangle DEF\).
- **Relevant Properties**:
  - The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of its side lengths.
  - Similar triangles have proportional perimeters.
  - The scale factor between similar triangles is the ratio of corresponding side lengths.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Shapes**:
  - Define the triangles \(\triangle DEF\) and \(\triangle CBF\).
  
- **Predicates for Similarity**:
  - Use the `Similar` predicate to indicate the similarity between the triangles.
  
- **Predicates for Measurements**:
  - Define the given side lengths and the perimeter of \(\triangle CBF\).
  
- **Predicates for Proportions**:
  - Use the `ScaleFactorOf` predicate to relate the sides of the similar triangles.
