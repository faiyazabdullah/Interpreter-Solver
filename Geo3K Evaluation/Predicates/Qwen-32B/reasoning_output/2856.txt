REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: Image Analysis
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present with center \( D \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are labeled.
  - \( B \) lies on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( C \) is outside the circle.
  - \( A \) and \( D \) lie on the same horizontal line, with \( D \) being the center of the circle.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( AB \) is a radius of the circle.
  - \( BC \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( B \).
  - \( AD \) is a radius of the circle.
  - \( DC \) is a straight line passing through the center \( D \) and extending beyond the circle.
  
- **Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 30 \).
  - \( CD = 18 \).
  - The radius of the circle is denoted as \( x \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The segment \( BC \) is tangent to the circle at point \( B \), indicating that \( \angle DBC = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: Relationship Identification
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( AB \) and \( AD \) are radii of the circle, so \( AB = AD = x \).
  - Since \( BC \) is tangent to the circle at \( B \), \( \angle DBC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( DC \) is a straight line, so \( DC = DB + BC \).
  - By the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle DBC \), \( DB^2 + BC^2 = DC^2 \).

#### STEP 3: Measurement Analysis
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 30 \).
  - \( CD = 18 \).
  - The radius \( AB = x \), and since \( D \) is the center, \( DB = x \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - In \( \triangle DBC \):
    - \( DB = x \) (radius).
    - \( BC = 30 \) (tangent segment).
    - \( DC = 18 \) (hypotenuse).

#### STEP 4: Question Analysis
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \), the radius of the circle.
- The key geometric property used here is the tangent-secant theorem and the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \( \triangle DBC \).

#### STEP 5: Predicate Planning
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using atomic predicates.
- The predicates will describe the shapes, points, lines, angles, and measurements without directly solving for \( x \).
