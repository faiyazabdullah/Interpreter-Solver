STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2960
================================================================================
QUESTION: find \sin S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains a triangle \( \triangle SRT \).
  - The vertices of the triangle are labeled \( S \), \( R \), and \( T \).
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - The sides of the triangle are labeled with lengths:
    - \( ST = 4 \)
    - \( TR = 3 \)
    - \( SR = 5 \)
  
- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( T \), indicating \( \angle STR \) is a right angle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right angle symbol at \( T \) confirms that \( \triangle SRT \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle SRT \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( T \).
  - \( ST \) and \( TR \) are the legs of the right triangle.
  - \( SR \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( ST = 4 \)
  - \( TR = 3 \)
  - \( SR = 5 \)

- **Implications**:
  - Since \( \triangle SRT \) is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies:
    \[
    ST^2 + TR^2 = SR^2
    \]
    Substituting the given values:
    \[
    4^2 + 3^2 = 5^2 \quad \text{(which is true: } 16 + 9 = 25\text{)}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( \sin S \).
- In a right triangle, \( \sin S \) is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse:
  \[
  \sin S = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{TR}{SR}
  \]
- From the diagram:
  - The side opposite to \( \angle S \) is \( TR = 3 \).
  - The hypotenuse is \( SR = 5 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, its sides, the right angle, and the relationships between the sides.
- The predicates should capture the geometric structure and measurements without explicitly solving for \( \sin S \).
