REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure consists of a combination of right triangles and rectangles.
  - Key points are labeled as \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), and \( DA \) are the sides of the figure.
  - \( BD \) is a diagonal connecting points \( B \) and \( D \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 10 \)
  - \( CA = 8 \)
  - \( AD = 4 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols are present at \( \angle BCA \), \( \angle CAD \), and \( \angle ADB \), indicating that \( \triangle BCA \), \( \triangle CAD \), and \( \triangle ADB \) are right triangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle BCA \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle CAD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle CAD = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle ADB \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \).
  - \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ADB \).
  - \( BD \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle BCD \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 10 \)
  - \( CA = 8 \)
  - \( AD = 4 \)
  
- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BCA \):
    \[
    BA = \sqrt{BC^2 + CA^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{100 + 64} = \sqrt{164} = 2\sqrt{41}
    \]
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle CAD \):
    \[
    CD = \sqrt{CA^2 + AD^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 16} = \sqrt{80} = 4\sqrt{5}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **perimeter** of the figure.
- The perimeter is the sum of all the side lengths: \( AB + BC + CD + DA \).
- We need to compute \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), and \( DA \) using the given measurements and relationships.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- The predicates will include definitions of points, lines, angles, right angles, and measurements.
- We will use the Pythagorean theorem to express relationships between the sides of the right triangles.
