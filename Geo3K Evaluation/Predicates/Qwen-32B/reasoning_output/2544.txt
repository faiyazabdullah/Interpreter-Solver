REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure is a parallelogram labeled \( JKLM \).
- **Points**: 
  - The vertices are labeled \( J, K, L, \) and \( M \).
- **Lines**: 
  - The sides of the parallelogram are \( JK, KL, LM, \) and \( MJ \).
- **Angles**: 
  - The angle \( \angle JKL \) is explicitly marked as \( 109^\circ \).
  - The angle \( \angle KLM \) is the one we need to determine.
- **Measurements**: 
  - The side \( ML \) is explicitly marked as \( 6 \) units.
- **Special Markings**: 
  - The figure is marked as a parallelogram, indicating opposite sides are equal and parallel.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \( JK \parallel ML \) and \( KL \parallel MJ \).
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( JK = ML \) and \( KL = MJ \).
  - Opposite angles are equal: \( \angle JKL = \angle MLM \) and \( \angle KLM = \angle MJL \).
  - Consecutive angles are supplementary: \( \angle JKL + \angle KLM = 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle JKL = 109^\circ \).
  - \( ML = 6 \) units.
- **Implications**:
  - Since \( JKLM \) is a parallelogram, the side \( JK = ML = 6 \) units.
  - The angle \( \angle KLM \) is related to \( \angle JKL \) through the property of consecutive angles being supplementary.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle KLM \).
- Using the property of consecutive angles in a parallelogram, we know:
  \[
  \angle JKL + \angle KLM = 180^\circ.
  \]
- Therefore, we can calculate \( \angle KLM \) as:
  \[
  \angle KLM = 180^\circ - \angle JKL = 180^\circ - 109^\circ = 71^\circ.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using predicates.
- The predicates will capture the parallelogram structure, angle measures, and side lengths without directly stating the final answer.
