REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - The figure consists of several intersecting lines forming triangles, parallelograms, and other polygons.
  - Key shapes include parallelograms (e.g., \(PQRS\) and \(KLMN\)) and triangles formed by intersections of lines.
  - Lines \(j\), \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) are marked with arrows, indicating they are likely parallel or related in some way.

- **Points and Labels:**
  - Points labeled \(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\) are present.
  - Specific angles are labeled with numbers: \(\angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4, \angle 5, \angle 6, \angle 7, \angle 8\).

- **Measurements:**
  - \(m\angle 1 = 50^\circ\) and \(m\angle 3 = 60^\circ\) are explicitly given.
  - Other angles are unlabeled but can be inferred from the relationships between lines and shapes.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Parallel lines are indicated by arrowheads on lines \(j\), \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\).
  - Corresponding angles and alternate interior angles are formed due to the transversals crossing parallel lines.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Parallel Lines:**
  - Lines \(j\), \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) appear to be parallel based on the arrowheads.
  - Transversals intersect these parallel lines, creating corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles.

- **Triangles and Parallelograms:**
  - Parallelogram \(PQRS\) is formed by lines \(p\) and \(q\) as opposite sides.
  - Triangle \(ABC\) is formed by the intersection of lines and has angles \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 3\), and \(\angle 8\).
  - Other triangles and quadrilaterals are formed by intersections of lines.

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - Angles \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) are given, and their relationships with other angles (e.g., \(\angle 8\)) can be deduced using properties of parallel lines and transversals.
  - Corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles will play a key role.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(m\angle 1 = 50^\circ\)
  - \(m\angle 3 = 60^\circ\)

- **Inferred Relationships:**
  - Since lines \(j\), \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) are parallel, angles formed by transversals will follow specific rules:
    - Corresponding angles are equal.
    - Alternate interior angles are equal.
    - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

- **Goal:**
  - Find \(m\angle 8\). This requires analyzing the relationships between \(\angle 1\), \(\angle 3\), and \(\angle 8\) through the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 8\).
- To find \(m\angle 8\), we need to use the given angles (\(\angle 1 = 50^\circ\) and \(\angle 3 = 60^\circ\)) and the properties of parallel lines and transversals.
- Specifically, we need to identify how \(\angle 8\) relates to \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 3\) through the geometric relationships in the figure.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate framework.
- Predicates will capture:
  - The parallelism of lines.
  - The formation of triangles and parallelograms.
  - The angle measures and their relationships.
  - The specific geometric properties (e.g., corresponding angles, alternate interior angles).
