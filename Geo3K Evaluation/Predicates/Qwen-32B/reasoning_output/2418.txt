================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle A D C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram includes a parallelogram \(ABCD\).
  - Additional triangles and smaller shapes are formed within the parallelogram, such as \(\triangle ABF\), \(\triangle BCF\), and \(\triangle DAF\).
  - Points \(A, B, C, D\) are vertices of the parallelogram.
  - Points \(E, F\) are internal points forming additional segments and triangles.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DA\) form the sides of the parallelogram.
  - Segments \(AF\), \(BF\), \(CF\), \(DF\) connect internal point \(F\) to the vertices.
  - Segments \(AE\), \(BE\), \(CE\), \(DE\) connect internal point \(E\) to the vertices.
  
- **Angles**:
  - \(\angle DAB = 20^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ABC = 40.1^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BCA = 32^\circ\)
  - Other angles are formed by intersections but are not explicitly labeled.
  
- **Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 6\)
  - \(BC = 9\)
  - \(CD = 6.86\)
  - Other segment lengths are not explicitly provided.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
  - Opposite angles are equal: \(\angle DAB = \angle BCD\) and \(\angle ABC = \angle CDA\).
  
- **Triangles**:
  - \(\triangle ABF\), \(\triangle BCF\), and \(\triangle DAF\) are formed within the parallelogram.
  - These triangles share common vertices and sides with the parallelogram.
  
- **Parallel and Perpendicular Relationships**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel: \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 6\), \(BC = 9\), \(CD = 6.86\).
  - Angles: \(\angle DAB = 20^\circ\), \(\angle ABC = 40.1^\circ\), \(\angle BCA = 32^\circ\).
  
- **Inferred Measurements**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, \(AD = BC = 9\) and \(CD = AB = 6.86\).
  - Opposite angles are equal: \(\angle BCD = \angle DAB = 20^\circ\) and \(\angle CDA = \angle ABC = 40.1^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m \angle ADC\).
- From the properties of a parallelogram, \(\angle CDA = \angle ABC\).
- Therefore, \(m \angle ADC = 40.1^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, its properties, and the given measurements.
- Ensure all relationships between points, lines, and angles are captured.
- Predicates should reflect the structure and constraints of the parallelogram without directly stating the final answer.
