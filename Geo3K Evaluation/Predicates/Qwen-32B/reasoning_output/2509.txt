### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains several labeled points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O.
- **Lines**: Multiple lines connect these points, forming a grid-like structure. Some lines appear to intersect at specific points.
- **Angles**: Angles are labeled numerically (e.g., ∠1, ∠2, ..., ∠14). The measure of ∠1 is given as 123°.
- **Measurements**: Numerical labels indicate specific angles (e.g., ∠1 = 123°).
- **Special Markings**: No special markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence are explicitly indicated.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The diagram appears to be a network of intersecting lines, forming various angles.
- The numbered angles suggest that the problem involves analyzing angle relationships, such as corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, or supplementary angles.
- Since no explicit parallel lines are marked, we need to infer relationships based on the given angle measures and the geometric structure.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of ∠1 is explicitly given as 123°.
- Other angles are labeled numerically (e.g., ∠2, ∠3, ..., ∠14), but their measures are not given directly. These must be deduced from the relationships between the angles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠14.
- To find ∠14, we need to use the relationships between the angles formed by intersecting lines. This likely involves identifying supplementary angles, vertical angles, or angles formed by transversals.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships between the angles and lines in the diagram.
- Predicates will include the existence of points, lines, angles, and relationships such as supplementary or vertical angles.
- The given measure of ∠1 will be used as a starting point to deduce other angle measures.
