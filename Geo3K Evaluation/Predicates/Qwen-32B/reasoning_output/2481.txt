STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2481
================================================================================
QUESTION: \odot P \cong \odot Q. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two circles are depicted:
    - Circle centered at \( P \) with points \( R \) and \( S \) on its circumference.
    - Circle centered at \( Q \) with points \( T \), \( U \), and \( V \) on its circumference.
  
- **Lines and Chords:**
  - Line \( RS \) is a chord in the circle centered at \( P \).
  - Line \( TU \) is a chord in the circle centered at \( Q \).

- **Angles and Arcs:**
  - An arc is subtended by the chord \( RS \) in the left circle, with a central angle of \( 155^\circ \).
  - An arc is subtended by the chord \( TU \) in the right circle, with a central angle of \( 205^\circ \).

- **Labels and Measurements:**
  - In the left circle, the length of the chord \( RS \) is given as \( 3x \).
  - In the right circle, the length of the chord \( TU \) is given as \( 7x - 44 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Both circles are marked as congruent (\( \odot P \cong \odot Q \)).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruence of Circles:**
  - Since \( \odot P \cong \odot Q \), the radii of both circles are equal.
  
- **Central Angles and Arcs:**
  - The central angle subtending the arc in the left circle is \( 155^\circ \).
  - The central angle subtending the arc in the right circle is \( 205^\circ \).
  - These angles determine the relative sizes of the arcs and the chords subtending them.

- **Chords and Radii:**
  - The lengths of the chords \( RS \) and \( TU \) are related to the central angles and the radii of the circles.
  - Since the circles are congruent, the relationship between the chords and their corresponding central angles will help us solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Left circle:
    - Central angle: \( 155^\circ \)
    - Chord length: \( 3x \)
  - Right circle:
    - Central angle: \( 205^\circ \)
    - Chord length: \( 7x - 44 \)

- **Relationships:**
  - The chords \( RS \) and \( TU \) are subtended by their respective central angles in congruent circles.
  - The length of a chord in a circle is determined by the formula:
    \[
    \text{Chord length} = 2r \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right),
    \]
    where \( r \) is the radius of the circle and \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we need to use the fact that the circles are congruent, meaning their radii are equal. The lengths of the chords \( RS \) and \( TU \) are given in terms of \( x \), and their relationship is governed by the central angles.
- We will set up an equation relating the chord lengths and solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the congruence of the circles and their radii.
- Represent the central angles and the chords.
- Use the relationship between the chord length and the central angle to set up an equation involving \( x \).
