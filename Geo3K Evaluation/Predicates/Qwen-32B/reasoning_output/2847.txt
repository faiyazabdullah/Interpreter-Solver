REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present with center \( C \).
  - Points \( L \), \( H \), \( J \), \( K \), and \( E \) lie on or around the circle.
  - Lines \( LJ \), \( JK \), and \( KE \) form segments connecting these points.
  - \( LJ \) appears to be a diameter of the circle since it passes through the center \( C \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - The arc \( \widehat{JLK} \) is labeled as \( 116^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings indicating perpendicularity, parallelism, or congruence are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - Since \( C \) is the center of the circle, any segment passing through \( C \) (like \( LJ \)) is a diameter.
  - The arc \( \widehat{JLK} \) subtends an inscribed angle at point \( K \).

- **Key Relationships:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
  - The arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) is the remaining part of the circle after subtracting \( \widehat{JLK} \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{JLK} \) is \( 116^\circ \).

- **Relationship Between Arcs:**
  - The total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Therefore, the measure of arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) can be calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Measure of } \widehat{JKL} = 360^\circ - \text{Measure of } \widehat{JLK}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Question Objective:**
  - Find the measure of arc \( \widehat{JKL} \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The total circumference of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The measure of an arc is related to the central angle subtending it.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, its center, and the points on the circle.
  - Indicate the measures of arcs and their relationships.
  - Use the property that the sum of arc measures in a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
