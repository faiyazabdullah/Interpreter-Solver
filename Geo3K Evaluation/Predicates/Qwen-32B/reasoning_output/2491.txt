REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( B \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 26 \): The length of the base of the triangle.
  - \( BC = 10 \): One of the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC = 24 \): The hypotenuse of the triangle.

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is drawn at \( \angle ABC \), indicating that \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 26 \): The base of the triangle.
  - \( BC = 10 \): One leg of the triangle.
  - \( AC = 24 \): The hypotenuse of the triangle.

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, the lengths of the sides satisfy the equation:
    \[
    AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
    \]
    However, the given values do not satisfy this equation:
    \[
    26^2 + 10^2 = 676 + 100 = 776 \quad \text{(but)} \quad 24^2 = 576
    \]
    This indicates a potential inconsistency in the problem statement or diagram. For the purpose of answering the question, we will proceed with the given measurements and focus on calculating \( \cos B \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the ratio of \( \cos B \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - In a right triangle, \( \cos B \) is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse:
    \[
    \cos B = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
    \]
    Here, the adjacent side to \( \angle B \) is \( BC \), and the hypotenuse is \( AC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the triangle and its properties.
  - Specify the right angle and the side lengths.
  - Ensure all geometric relationships are captured without deriving the final answer.
