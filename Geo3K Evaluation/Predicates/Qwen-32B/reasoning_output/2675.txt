REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is present with center \( E \).
  - Points \( B, C, D, \) and \( F \) are labeled.
  - Lines \( BC \) and \( DF \) are drawn, intersecting the circle.
  - Angles are marked at point \( D \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - The angle \( \angle BDF \) is labeled as \( 102^\circ \).
  - The angle \( \angle 1 \) is labeled near point \( F \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The line segment \( DF \) appears to be tangent to the circle at point \( F \).
  - The line segment \( BD \) appears to be a secant passing through the circle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( DF \) is tangent to the circle at \( F \).
  - \( BD \) is a secant passing through the circle, intersecting it at points \( D \) and \( F \).
  - The angle \( \angle BDF \) is an external angle formed by the secant \( BD \) and the tangent \( DF \).
  - The angle \( \angle 1 \) is related to the tangent-secant configuration.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of contact is equal to the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.
  - The external angle \( \angle BDF \) is related to the internal angles of the circle via the tangent-secant theorem.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle BDF = 102^\circ \).

- **Measurement Relationships**:
  - The tangent-secant theorem states that the external angle \( \angle BDF \) is equal to the sum of the angles subtended by the arcs created by the secant and tangent.
  - Since \( DF \) is tangent and \( BD \) is secant, \( \angle 1 \) is part of the internal angle configuration that relates to \( \angle BDF \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The tangent-secant theorem states that the measure of an angle formed by a tangent and a secant drawn from a point outside a circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
  - Here, \( \angle BDF \) is the external angle, and \( \angle 1 \) is one of the internal angles related to the tangent and secant.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the circle, points, lines, and angles.
  - Capture the tangent and secant relationships.
  - Represent the given angle \( \angle BDF = 102^\circ \).
  - Use geometric properties to relate \( \angle 1 \) to \( \angle BDF \).
