REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a triangle \( \triangle RST \).
  - Points \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Point \( S \) is marked with a right angle symbol, indicating that \( \angle RST \) is a right angle.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - Line segment \( RS \) has a length of \( 4\sqrt{3} \).
  - Line segment \( ST \) has a length of \( 10\sqrt{3} \).
  - Line segment \( RT \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle RST \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol at \( \angle RST \) confirms that \( \triangle RST \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( S \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle RST \) is a right triangle with \( \angle RST = 90^\circ \).
  - \( RS \) and \( ST \) are the legs of the right triangle.
  - \( RT \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies: \( RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2 \).
  - The trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) can be used to find the measures of the angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( RS = 4\sqrt{3} \)
  - \( ST = 10\sqrt{3} \)
  - The lengths of \( RS \) and \( ST \) are given, and we need to use them to find \( \angle T \).

- **Relevant Measurements:**
  - The lengths of the legs of the right triangle are known, so we can use trigonometric functions to find \( \angle T \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle T \) to the nearest tenth.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
  - Here, \( \tan(\angle T) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{RS}{ST} \).

- **Information Needed:**
  - The lengths of \( RS \) and \( ST \) are given, so we can compute \( \tan(\angle T) \) and then find \( \angle T \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the triangle and its components.
  - Specify the right angle at \( S \).
  - Provide the lengths of the sides \( RS \) and \( ST \).
  - Indicate that \( RT \) is the hypotenuse.
  - Use trigonometric relationships to express the connection between the sides and the angle \( \angle T \).
