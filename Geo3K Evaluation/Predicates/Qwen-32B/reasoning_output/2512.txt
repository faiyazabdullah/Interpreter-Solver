REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a right angle at point \( B \) (marked with a square symbol).
  - Point \( B \) is the vertex where the right angle is formed.
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( AB \) is one side of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is another side of the triangle.
  - \( CA \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - There is a vertical line segment \( BD \) from \( B \) to \( AC \), where \( D \) lies on \( AC \).

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( AB = 12 \) units.
  - \( AD = z \) units (part of the hypotenuse \( AC \)).
  - \( DC = 10 \) units (the remaining part of the hypotenuse \( AC \)).
  - The length of \( BD \) is denoted as \( x \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol at \( B \) indicates that \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - The segments \( AD \) and \( DC \) suggest that \( D \) is a point dividing \( AC \) into two parts.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( BD \) is the altitude from the right angle \( B \) to the hypotenuse \( AC \).
  - The altitude \( BD \) divides the hypotenuse \( AC \) into two segments: \( AD = z \) and \( DC = 10 \).
  - By the geometric mean theorem (altitude-on-hypotenuse theorem), \( BD^2 = AD \cdot DC \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to \( \triangle ABC \): \( AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 \).
  - Since \( BD \) is the altitude, it creates two smaller right triangles \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BDC \), both similar to \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( AB = 12 \) units.
  - \( DC = 10 \) units.
  - \( AD = z \) units (unknown).
  - \( BD = x \) units (unknown, to be found).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The total length of the hypotenuse \( AC = AD + DC = z + 10 \).
  - Using the altitude-on-hypotenuse theorem: \( BD^2 = AD \cdot DC \Rightarrow x^2 = z \cdot 10 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the value of \( x \), the length of the altitude \( BD \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The altitude-on-hypotenuse theorem: \( BD^2 = AD \cdot DC \).
  - The Pythagorean theorem can be used to find additional relationships if needed.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and its sides.
  - Indicate the right angle and the altitude.
  - Capture the segment lengths and their relationships.
  - Use the altitude-on-hypotenuse theorem to relate \( x \), \( z \), and \( 10 \).
