### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a point \( D \) outside the triangle, and a line segment \( AD \) is drawn extending from \( A \).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - \( \overline{AB} \) is one side of the triangle.
  - \( \overline{BC} \) is another side of the triangle.
  - \( \overline{AC} \) is the third side of the triangle.
  - An external angle \( \angle DAB \) is marked as \( 123^\circ \).
  - A right angle symbol is marked at \( \angle ACB \), indicating \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The side \( \overline{AB} \) is labeled as 4 units.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right angle at \( C \) indicates that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
  - The external angle \( \angle DAB \) is formed by extending \( \overline{AD} \) beyond \( A \).
  - The external angle \( \angle DAB \) is related to the internal angles of \( \triangle ABC \) through the external angle theorem.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \overline{AB} = 4 \) units.
  - \( \angle DAB = 123^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

- **Derived Information**:
  - Since \( \angle DAB \) is an external angle, it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles of \( \triangle ABC \). Specifically:
    \[
    \angle DAB = \angle BAC + \angle ABC
    \]
  - We need to find \( \angle 4 \), which is \( \angle ABC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 4 \), which is \( \angle ABC \).
- To find \( \angle ABC \), we use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \) and the external angle theorem.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- The predicates should capture the triangle, its sides, angles, and the external angle relationship without directly solving for the final answer.
