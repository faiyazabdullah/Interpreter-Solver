================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present with center \( G \).
  - Points \( F, E, H, J, A, B \) are labeled on or around the circle.
  - Lines connect these points to form segments and chords.
  - Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3 \).

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations:**
  - \( \angle 2 \) is labeled with measure \( 2x \).
  - \( \angle 3 \) is labeled with measure \( x \).
  - No other numerical measurements are explicitly provided.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings (e.g., right angles, congruence marks) are visible beyond the angle labels.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The circle has its center at \( G \).
  - \( B \) appears to be the intersection of two chords, possibly making it a point of interest for angle relationships.
  - \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are angles subtended by arcs of the circle.
  - The relationship between \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) suggests a proportional relationship involving \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle 2 = 2x \)
  - \( \angle 3 = x \)

- **Measurement Relationships:**
  - The measures of \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are given in terms of \( x \). This indicates a proportional relationship between the two angles.
  - Since no other numerical values are provided, the solution will rely on the relationship \( \angle 2 = 2 \times \angle 3 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Question Objective:**
  - The question asks to find \( m \angle 3 \) given \( m \angle 2 = 2x \) and \( m \angle 3 = x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The relationship \( \angle 2 = 2 \times \angle 3 \) is already provided.
  - No additional geometric constraints or properties are necessary to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, its center, and the points on the circle.
  - Capture the angle measures and their relationships.
  - Ensure all visible geometric elements and their interactions are represented.
