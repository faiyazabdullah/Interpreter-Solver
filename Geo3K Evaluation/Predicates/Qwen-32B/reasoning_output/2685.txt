================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - A quadrilateral \( QRSP \).
  - Diagonals \( QS \) and \( RP \) intersect at point \( T \).

- **Points**:
  - \( Q, R, S, P, T \).

- **Lines**:
  - \( QR, RS, SP, PQ, QS, RP \).

- **Measurements**:
  - Side \( RS \): \( 2y + 12 \).
  - Side \( PQ \): \( 5x - 28 \).
  - Segment \( QT \): \( x \).
  - Segment \( TP \): \( 5y \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No explicit markings indicating right angles, parallel lines, or congruence.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral \( QRSP \) is not explicitly marked as any specific type (e.g., rectangle, rhombus). However, the question asks us to find \( y \) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- In a parallelogram:
  1. Opposite sides are equal: \( RS = PQ \).
  2. Diagonals bisect each other: \( QT = TP \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- From the diagram:
  - \( RS = 2y + 12 \).
  - \( PQ = 5x - 28 \).
  - \( QT = x \).
  - \( TP = 5y \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The goal is to find the value of \( y \) such that \( QRSP \) becomes a parallelogram.
- To achieve this:
  1. Use the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal: \( RS = PQ \).
  2. Use the property that diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other: \( QT = TP \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the relationships between the sides and diagonals of the quadrilateral.
- The predicates will capture:
  1. The equality of opposite sides (\( RS = PQ \)).
  2. The bisection of diagonals (\( QT = TP \)).
  3. The geometric structure of the quadrilateral.
