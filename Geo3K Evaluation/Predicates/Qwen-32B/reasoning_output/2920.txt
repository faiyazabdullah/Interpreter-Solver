REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure depicts a trapezoid \( QRUT \) with bases \( QR \) and \( UT \).
  - Points \( V \) and \( S \) are marked on the legs \( QU \) and \( RT \) respectively.
  
- **Points**: 
  - \( Q, R, T, U, V, S \) are labeled points.
  
- **Lines/Segments**: 
  - Segments \( QR \), \( RT \), \( TU \), \( UQ \), \( QU \), and \( RT \) form the trapezoid.
  - Segments \( QV \), \( VS \), and \( ST \) are also present.
  
- **Special Markings**: 
  - No explicit angle markings or congruence symbols are visible.
  - Midpoints \( V \) and \( S \) are indicated on the legs \( QU \) and \( RT \), respectively.

- **Measurements**: 
  - \( QR = 4 \)
  - \( UT = 16 \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( QR \) and \( UT \) are parallel sides of the trapezoid (\( QR \parallel UT \)).
  - \( V \) and \( S \) are midpoints of the non-parallel sides \( QU \) and \( RT \), respectively.
  - The segment \( VS \) is the midsegment of the trapezoid, connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides.

- **Implied Properties**:
  - The midsegment \( VS \) of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases \( QR \) and \( UT \).
  - The length of the midsegment \( VS \) is the average of the lengths of the two bases \( QR \) and \( UT \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( QR = 4 \)
  - \( UT = 16 \)
  
- **Relevant Measurements**:
  - The length of the midsegment \( VS \) depends on the lengths of the bases \( QR \) and \( UT \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks for the length of the midsegment \( VS \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Property**:
  - The midsegment of a trapezoid is equal to the average of the lengths of its two bases.
  - Formula: \( VS = \frac{QR + UT}{2} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the trapezoid and its components.
  - Indicate the parallelism of the bases.
  - Specify the midpoints and the midsegment.
  - Relate the lengths of the bases and the midsegment.
