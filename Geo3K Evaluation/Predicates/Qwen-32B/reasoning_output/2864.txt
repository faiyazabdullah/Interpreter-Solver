REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a right triangle \( \triangle PMN \).
  - Points labeled: \( P \), \( M \), and \( N \).
  - Line segments: \( PM \), \( MN \), and \( PN \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( PM = 36 \) (horizontal side).
  - \( PN = 15 \) (vertical side).
  - \( MN = 39 \) (hypotenuse).

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol at \( \angle P \), indicating \( \angle MPN = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle PMN \) is a right triangle because it has a right angle at \( P \).
  - \( PM \) and \( PN \) are the legs of the right triangle.
  - \( MN \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies: \( PM^2 + PN^2 = MN^2 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( PM = 36 \) (one leg of the right triangle).
  - \( PN = 15 \) (the other leg of the right triangle).
  - \( MN = 39 \) (hypotenuse of the right triangle).

- **Relationships**:
  - The given measurements satisfy the Pythagorean theorem:
    \[
    PM^2 + PN^2 = 36^2 + 15^2 = 1296 + 225 = 1521 = 39^2.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **ratio of \(\cos N\)** as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
- In a right triangle, \(\cos N\) is defined as the adjacent side over the hypotenuse:
  \[
  \cos N = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{MN}{PN}.
  \]
- However, since \( N \) is the vertex opposite the hypotenuse, the correct interpretation is:
  \[
  \cos N = \frac{\text{adjacent to } N}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{PM}{MN}.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Ensure all visible information is captured, including the right triangle, its sides, and the right angle.
