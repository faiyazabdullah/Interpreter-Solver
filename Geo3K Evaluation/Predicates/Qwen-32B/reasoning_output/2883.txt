REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a rectangle \( TXYZW \).
  - Diagonal \( TZ \) is drawn inside the rectangle, dividing it into two triangles.
  - Another diagonal \( WY \) intersects \( TZ \) at point \( Z \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( TY, YX, XZ, ZW, WT \) form the perimeter of the rectangle.
  - Diagonals \( TZ \) and \( WY \) intersect at \( Z \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle TYX = 52^\circ \).
  - \( \angle WYZ = 38^\circ \).
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle TXZ, \angle WZY, \angle YZX, \) and \( \angle XYZ \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( TY = 1 \).
  - \( WX = 2 \).
  - \( XZ = 3 \).
  - \( ZW = 4 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols indicate that \( TXYZW \) is a rectangle.
  - The intersection of diagonals forms four angles labeled \( 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rectangle Properties:**
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel: \( TY = XZ = 3 \) and \( YX = ZW = 4 \).
  - All interior angles are right angles.

- **Diagonals:**
  - Diagonals \( TZ \) and \( WY \) intersect at \( Z \).
  - The diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other.

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle TYX = 52^\circ \) and \( \angle WYZ = 38^\circ \) are given.
  - Since \( TXYZW \) is a rectangle, the angles at the intersections of diagonals are related by complementary and supplementary angle properties.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( TY = 1 \), \( WX = 2 \), \( XZ = 3 \), \( ZW = 4 \).
  - These values confirm the dimensions of the rectangle.

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - \( \angle TYX = 52^\circ \) and \( \angle WYZ = 38^\circ \) imply that the diagonals divide the rectangle into triangles with specific angle measures.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \angle 3 \), which is the measure of the angle labeled \( 3 \) at the intersection of diagonals \( TZ \) and \( WY \).
- To find \( m \angle 3 \), we need to use the properties of the rectangle and the given angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle and its properties.
- Define the diagonals and their intersection.
- Use angle relationships and the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other to determine \( m \angle 3 \).
