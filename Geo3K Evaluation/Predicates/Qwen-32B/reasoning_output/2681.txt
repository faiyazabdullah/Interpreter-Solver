REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram consists of two triangles: ΔABC and ΔABD.
  - Points labeled: A, B, C, D.
  - Lines: AB, BC, CD, DA, BD.
  
- **Measurements**:
  - Side AD = 4.
  - Side AC = 6.
  - Side BD = y (to be found).
  
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols are present at ∠ABD and ∠BCD, indicating that:
    - Line AB is perpendicular to line BD.
    - Line BC is perpendicular to line CD.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - ΔABD is a right triangle with the right angle at B.
  - ΔBCD is a right triangle with the right angle at C.
  - Line BD is the hypotenuse of ΔABD.
  - Line AC is the hypotenuse of ΔBCD.
  - Since both triangles share the side BC, they are connected through point B and C.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - Both triangles satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.
  - The lengths of sides AD, AC, and BC are related through the triangles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - AD = 4 (leg of ΔABD).
  - AC = 6 (hypotenuse of ΔBCD).
  - BD = y (hypotenuse of ΔABD, to be found).
  
- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - In ΔABD: \( BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 \).
  - In ΔBCD: \( AC^2 = BC^2 + CD^2 \).
  - Since BC is common to both triangles, its length can be expressed in terms of the other sides using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \), which is the length of side BD.
- To find \( y \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem in ΔABD:
  \[
  BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2
  \]
- However, we do not have the direct length of AB. Instead, we will use the relationship between the triangles and the given measurements to solve for \( y \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will include descriptions of the triangles, right angles, side lengths, and the Pythagorean theorem relationships.
- The final predicates will ensure that all visible information is captured without directly solving for \( y \).
