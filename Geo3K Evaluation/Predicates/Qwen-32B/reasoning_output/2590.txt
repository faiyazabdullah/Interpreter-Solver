REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains multiple triangles and segments.
  - Key points labeled: \( G \), \( H \), \( I \), \( J \), \( K \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments \( GH \), \( GK \), \( KJ \), \( HI \), and \( JI \).
  - Arrows indicate parallelism between segments \( KJ \) and \( HI \), and \( JI \) and \( KH \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols are present at points \( G \), \( K \), and \( H \). This indicates that \( \triangle GKH \) and \( \triangle JKH \) are right triangles.
  - Parallel lines are indicated by arrowheads on \( KJ \parallel HI \) and \( JI \parallel KH \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( GH = 9 \)
  - \( GK = 6 \)
  - \( KJ = 4 \)

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Parallel Relationships:**
  - \( KJ \parallel HI \)
  - \( JI \parallel KH \)

- **Right Triangles:**
  - \( \triangle GKH \) is a right triangle with \( \angle KGK \) being the right angle.
  - \( \triangle JKH \) is also a right triangle with \( \angle KJH \) being the right angle.

- **Similarity and Proportionality:**
  - Since \( KJ \parallel HI \) and \( JI \parallel KH \), quadrilateral \( JKHI \) is a parallelogram.
  - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length: \( KJ = HI \) and \( JI = KH \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( GH = 9 \)
  - \( GK = 6 \)
  - \( KJ = 4 \)

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( \triangle GKH \) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( KH \):
    \[
    KH = \sqrt{GH^2 - GK^2} = \sqrt{9^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{81 - 36} = \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5}
    \]

  - Since \( JKHI \) is a parallelogram, \( JI = KH = 3\sqrt{5} \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the length of \( GI \).
- To find \( GI \), we need to consider the entire configuration:
  - \( GI \) is the sum of \( GK \) and \( KI \).
  - Since \( KI = KH + HI \) and \( HI = KJ = 4 \), we have:
    \[
    KI = KH + HI = 3\sqrt{5} + 4
    \]
  - Therefore:
    \[
    GI = GK + KI = 6 + (3\sqrt{5} + 4) = 10 + 3\sqrt{5}
    \]

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will include:
  - Definitions of points, lines, and triangles.
  - Right-angle relationships.
  - Parallel relationships.
  - Lengths of segments.
  - Relationships within the parallelogram.
