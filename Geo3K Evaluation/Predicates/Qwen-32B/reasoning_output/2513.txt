### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image depicts a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \( AB \) is labeled as \( x \).
  - \( BC \) is labeled as 16.
  - \( AC \) is labeled as 21.
  
- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle CAB = 97^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ACB = 21^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Properties**:
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is scalene because no sides or angles are marked as equal.
  - The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can calculate \( \angle ABC \):
    \[
    \angle ABC = 180^\circ - \angle CAB - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 97^\circ - 21^\circ = 62^\circ.
    \]

- **Relationships**:
  - The sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - The angles \( \angle CAB \), \( \angle ACB \), and \( \angle ABC \) are the interior angles of the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AB = x \) (to be determined).
  - \( BC = 16 \).
  - \( AC = 21 \).
  - \( \angle CAB = 97^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ACB = 21^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 62^\circ \) (calculated).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**:
  - The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \), which represents the length of side \( AB \).
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - We can use the Law of Sines or the Law of Cosines to solve for \( x \). Since we have two sides and the included angle (\( \angle ACB \)), the Law of Cosines is suitable:
    \[
    AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 - 2 \cdot AC \cdot BC \cdot \cos(\angle ACB).
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    x^2 = 21^2 + 16^2 - 2 \cdot 21 \cdot 16 \cdot \cos(21^\circ).
    \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Elements**:
  - Define the triangle and its vertices.
  - Define the sides and their lengths.
  - Define the angles and their measures.
- **Predicates for Relationships**:
  - Use the Law of Cosines to express the relationship between the sides and the angle.
