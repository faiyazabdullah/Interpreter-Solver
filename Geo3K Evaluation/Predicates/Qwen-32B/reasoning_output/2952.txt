REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a trapezoid \( QRST \).
  - Points \( A \) and \( B \) are midpoints of the non-parallel sides (legs) \( QT \) and \( SR \), respectively.
  - Lines \( QA \) and \( RB \) are parallel to each other, making \( QR \) and \( ST \) the bases of the trapezoid.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( QR = 20 \) (base of the trapezoid).
  - \( TS = 12 \) (top base of the trapezoid).
  - \( TA \) and \( SB \) are segments connecting the midpoints to the top base.
  
- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle QTA = 120^\circ \).
  - \( \angle SBR = 45^\circ \).

- **Midpoints:**
  - \( A \) is the midpoint of \( QT \).
  - \( B \) is the midpoint of \( SR \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelism:**
  - \( QR \parallel TS \) (bases of the trapezoid).
  - \( QA \parallel RB \) (since \( A \) and \( B \) are midpoints of the legs).

- **Midpoints:**
  - Since \( A \) and \( B \) are midpoints, \( AB \) is the midsegment of the trapezoid, which is parallel to the bases and equal to the average of the lengths of the bases.

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - \( \angle QTA = 120^\circ \) implies that \( \angle TQR = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ \) (since \( QR \parallel TS \)).
  - \( \angle SBR = 45^\circ \) is directly given.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Base Lengths:**
  - \( QR = 20 \).
  - \( TS = 12 \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle QTA = 120^\circ \).
  - \( \angle SBR = 45^\circ \).

- **Midsegment:**
  - The midsegment \( AB \) is parallel to the bases and has a length equal to the average of the bases: \( AB = \frac{QR + TS}{2} = \frac{20 + 12}{2} = 16 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle S \).
- To find \( \angle S \), we need to use the properties of the trapezoid and the given angles. Specifically, we need to consider the internal angles formed by the trapezoid's sides and the given angles at \( T \) and \( R \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the trapezoid structure, the midpoints, the parallelism, and the given angles.
