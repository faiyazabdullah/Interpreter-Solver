================================================================================
QUESTION: Find a in the given parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( W, X, Y, Z \).
  - Diagonals \( WX \) and \( YZ \) intersect at point \( A \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \( WX = 10 \).
  - \( WY = 2 \).
  - \( YZ = 2b - 6 \).
  - \( XZ = a - 7 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The diagonals \( WX \) and \( YZ \) intersect at point \( A \), suggesting symmetry or specific relationships.
  - No right angles or parallel lines are explicitly marked, but the problem specifies it as a parallelogram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( WX = YZ \) and \( WY = XZ \).
  - Diagonals bisect each other: The intersection point \( A \) divides each diagonal into two equal segments.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( WX = 10 \): One diagonal of the parallelogram.
  - \( WY = 2 \): Half of one side of the parallelogram.
  - \( YZ = 2b - 6 \): Opposite side to \( WX \).
  - \( XZ = a - 7 \): Opposite side to \( WY \).

- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( WX \) and \( YZ \) are opposite sides of the parallelogram, \( WX = YZ \). Therefore, \( YZ = 10 \).
  - Similarly, \( WY \) and \( XZ \) are opposite sides, so \( WY = XZ \). Therefore, \( XZ = 2 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( a \).
- From the measurement \( XZ = a - 7 \), we know \( XZ = 2 \) (as derived from the parallelogram property).
- Thus, we need to solve for \( a \) using the equation \( a - 7 = 2 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram and its properties.
- Include all given measurements and their relationships.
- Ensure that all geometric constraints are captured without directly solving for \( a \).
