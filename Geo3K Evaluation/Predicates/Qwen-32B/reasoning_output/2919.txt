STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2919
================================================================================
QUESTION: One diagonal of a rhombus is twice as long as the other diagonal. If the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters, what are the lengths of the diagonals?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - The figure depicts a rhombus with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( X \).
  - The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at point \( B \), dividing the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.

- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( X \).
  - Diagonals: \( AC \) and \( BX \).

- **Measurements:**
  - One diagonal (\( AC \)) is labeled as having a length of \( 2x \).
  - The other diagonal (\( BX \)) is not explicitly labeled but is described as being half the length of \( AC \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The diagonals appear to intersect perpendicularly at point \( B \), which is a property of rhombuses.
  - The diagonals bisect each other at point \( B \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
  - The diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.
  - One diagonal is twice as long as the other diagonal.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The area of the rhombus is given as 169 square millimeters.
  - The formula for the area of a rhombus using its diagonals is:
    \[
    \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
    \]
    where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the lengths of the diagonals.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Area of the rhombus: 169 square millimeters.
  - One diagonal (\( AC \)): \( 2x \).
  - The other diagonal (\( BX \)): \( x \) (since it is half the length of \( AC \)).

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - Using the area formula:
    \[
    169 = \frac{1}{2} \times (2x) \times x
    \]
    Simplifying:
    \[
    169 = x^2
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question seeks the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus.
  - From the problem, one diagonal is \( 2x \) and the other is \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The relationship between the diagonals and the area of the rhombus.
  - The fact that the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the rhombus and its properties.
  - Specify the diagonals and their relationships.
  - Represent the area of the rhombus and the relationship between the diagonals.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are captured.
