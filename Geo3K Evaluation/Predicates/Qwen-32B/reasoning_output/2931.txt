STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2931
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find w in the given parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( F, G, H, J \).
  - There is a point \( A \) inside the quadrilateral, which appears to be the intersection of diagonals.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Diagonals \( FG \) and \( JH \) intersect at \( A \).
  - The sides of the quadrilateral are labeled with algebraic expressions:
    - \( FG = 2b + 5 \)
    - \( JH = 3b + 1 \)
    - \( GH = 2w + 3 \)
    - \( FJ = 4w - 7 \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - The figure is marked as a parallelogram, indicating opposite sides are equal and parallel.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Properties of a Parallelogram**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( FG = JH \) and \( GH = FJ \).
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \( FG \parallel JH \) and \( GH \parallel FJ \).
  - Diagonals bisect each other: \( FA = AG \) and \( JA = AH \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( FG = 2b + 5 \)
  - \( JH = 3b + 1 \)
  - \( GH = 2w + 3 \)
  - \( FJ = 4w - 7 \)

- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( FG = JH \) in a parallelogram:
    \[
    2b + 5 = 3b + 1
    \]
  - Since \( GH = FJ \) in a parallelogram:
    \[
    2w + 3 = 4w - 7
    \]

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks us to find the value of \( w \).
- To solve for \( w \), we use the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal:
  \[
  GH = FJ \implies 2w + 3 = 4w - 7
  \]

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The predicates will capture the properties of the parallelogram, the equality of opposite sides, and the algebraic expressions for the sides.
