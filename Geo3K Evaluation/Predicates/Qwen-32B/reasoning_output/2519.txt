QUESTION: Find m \angle R C M.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is present with center \( C \).
  - Points \( R \), \( M \), \( N \), and \( L \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines connecting \( C \) to \( R \), \( M \), \( N \), and \( L \) are radii of the circle.
  
- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - \( \angle MCN = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle RCN \) is labeled as \( (x - 1)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle RCL \) is labeled as \( (3x + 5)^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings (like right angles, parallel lines, etc.) are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( R \), \( M \), \( N \), and \( L \) are points on the circumference of the circle, so they form arcs.
  - \( CR \), \( CM \), \( CN \), and \( CL \) are radii of the circle, meaning they are equal in length.
  - \( \angle RCN \) and \( \angle RCL \) are central angles subtended by the respective arcs.
  - \( \angle MCN = 60^\circ \) is given, which is part of the larger angle \( \angle RCL \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle MCN = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle RCN = (x - 1)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle RCL = (3x + 5)^\circ \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - Since \( \angle RCL \) is the sum of \( \angle RCN \) and \( \angle NCN \), we have:
    \[
    \angle RCL = \angle RCN + \angle MCN.
    \]
    Substituting the given expressions:
    \[
    3x + 5 = (x - 1) + 60.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle RCM \).
- To find \( m\angle RCM \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) from the equation derived in Step 3 and then use it to find \( \angle RCN \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the circle, its center, points on the circumference, radii, and the given angles.
- The relationships between the angles \( \angle RCN \), \( \angle MCN \), and \( \angle RCL \) should be explicitly stated.
