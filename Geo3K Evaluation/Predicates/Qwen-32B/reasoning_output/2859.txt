STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2859
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure is a parallelogram with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( B \) (indicated by the right angle symbol).
  - There is an angle of \( 60^\circ \) at vertex \( D \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - The sides of the parallelogram are labeled with lengths:
    - \( AB = 10 \) m (side adjacent to the right angle).
    - \( AD = 12 \) m (opposite side to \( BC \)).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The dashed line from \( B \) to \( AD \) indicates the height (altitude) of the parallelogram, perpendicular to \( AD \).
  - The right angle symbol at \( B \) confirms that \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( BC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( AB = CD = 10 \) m and \( AD = BC = 12 \) m.
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Adjacent angles are supplementary.

- **Right Angle Constraint**:
  - The right angle at \( B \) implies that \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.

- **Height and Base**:
  - The height from \( B \) to \( AD \) forms a right triangle with \( AB \) and part of \( AD \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 10 \) m.
  - \( AD = 12 \) m.
  - \( \angle D = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle B = 90^\circ \).

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since it is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal:
    - \( AB = CD = 10 \) m.
    - \( AD = BC = 12 \) m.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **perimeter** of the parallelogram.
- The perimeter of a parallelogram is given by:
  \[
  \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length of one pair of opposite sides} + \text{length of the other pair of opposite sides})
  \]
- Using the given side lengths:
  \[
  \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (AB + AD) = 2 \times (10 + 12) = 2 \times 22 = 44 \text{ m}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Ensure that all given information and constraints are included without directly stating the final answer.
