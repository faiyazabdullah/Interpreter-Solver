REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a right triangle with vertices labeled \( X \), \( A \), and \( B \).
  - The right angle is at vertex \( A \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - Line \( AX \) is one leg of the triangle, and its length is given as 5 units.
  - Line \( XB \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and its length is given as 13 units.
  - Line \( AB \) is the other leg of the triangle, and its length is not explicitly given but can be calculated.

- **Annotations and Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at vertex \( A \), indicating that \( \angle XAB = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle XAB \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - \( AX \) and \( AB \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( XB \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to the right triangle: \( AX^2 + AB^2 = XB^2 \).
  - The tangent of angle \( X \) (\( \tan X \)) is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in the right triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( AX = 5 \) (one leg of the triangle).
  - \( XB = 13 \) (hypotenuse of the triangle).
  - \( AB \) is the unknown length of the other leg, which needs to be calculated.

- **Measurement Relationships:**
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem: \( AX^2 + AB^2 = XB^2 \).
  - Substituting known values: \( 5^2 + AB^2 = 13^2 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks for \( \tan X \).
  - To find \( \tan X \), we need the lengths of the sides opposite and adjacent to angle \( X \):
    - Opposite side: \( AB \)
    - Adjacent side: \( AX \)

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - \( \tan X = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{AB}{AX} \).
  - We already know \( AX = 5 \). We need to calculate \( AB \) using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the right triangle and its properties.
  - Indicate the right angle at \( A \).
  - Define the lengths of the sides.
  - Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides.
  - Ensure all visible relationships and constraints are captured.
