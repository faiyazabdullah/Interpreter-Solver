================================================================================
QUESTION: Find B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure contains multiple triangles and lines.
  - Key points: \( A, B, C, D, E \).
  - Triangles: \( \triangle ABE \), \( \triangle BCD \), and others formed by intersections.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments are labeled with lengths:
    - \( AE = 5 \)
    - \( BD = 3 \)
    - \( BE = x + 3 \)
    - \( BC = 2x - 8 \)
  
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle AEB \), \( \angle BEC \), and \( \angle BDC \).
  - These indicate perpendicularity among certain lines.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle AEB \) is a right angle, so \( AE \perp BE \).
  - \( \angle BEC \) is a right angle, so \( BE \perp EC \).
  - \( \angle BDC \) is a right angle, so \( BD \perp DC \).

- **Perpendicular Lines**:
  - \( AE \perp BE \)
  - \( BE \perp EC \)
  - \( BD \perp DC \)

- **Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle ABE \) is a right triangle with \( \angle AEB = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle BCD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle BEC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BEC = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AE = 5 \)
  - \( BD = 3 \)
  - \( BE = x + 3 \)
  - \( BC = 2x - 8 \)

- **Variables**:
  - The length of \( BE \) is expressed as \( x + 3 \).
  - The length of \( BC \) is expressed as \( 2x - 8 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BC \).
- To find \( BC \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) using the given relationships and measurements.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The predicates should include:
  - Geometric shapes and points.
  - Line segments and their lengths.
  - Right angles and perpendicularity.
  - Relationships between variables and numerical values.
