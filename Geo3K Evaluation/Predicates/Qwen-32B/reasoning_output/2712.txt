================================================================================
QUESTION: If D B = 24, A E = 3, and E C = 18, find A D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E \) are labeled.
  - Line segments \( AD, DE, EC, AB, BC, AC \) are visible.
  - \( D \) and \( E \) lie on \( AB \) and \( AC \), respectively.

- **Special Markings:**
  - There are pink arrowheads on \( DB \), \( AE \), and \( EC \), indicating direction but no specific geometric property like parallelism or perpendicularity.

- **Measurements:**
  - \( DB = 24 \)
  - \( AE = 3 \)
  - \( EC = 18 \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Points and Lines:**
  - \( D \) lies on \( AB \), so \( D \) divides \( AB \) into segments \( AD \) and \( DB \).
  - \( E \) lies on \( AC \), so \( E \) divides \( AC \) into segments \( AE \) and \( EC \).

- **Proportional Segments:**
  - Since \( D \) and \( E \) divide \( AB \) and \( AC \) respectively, the problem likely involves similar triangles or proportional segments.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( DB = 24 \)
  - \( AE = 3 \)
  - \( EC = 18 \)

- **Relationships:**
  - The total length of \( AC \) is \( AE + EC = 3 + 18 = 21 \).
  - The problem involves finding \( AD \), which requires understanding the proportionality between segments \( AD : DB \) and \( AE : EC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Goal:**
  - Find the length of \( AD \).

- **Relevant Relationships:**
  - The problem involves the division of sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) by points \( D \) and \( E \), respectively.
  - The key is to use the proportionality of segments \( AD : DB \) and \( AE : EC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define points, lines, and segments.
  - Represent the given lengths and their relationships.
  - Capture the proportional relationship between segments.
