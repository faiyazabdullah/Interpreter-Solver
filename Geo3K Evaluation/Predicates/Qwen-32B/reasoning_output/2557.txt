REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is present with center \( B \).
  - Points \( D \), \( E \), \( C \), and \( B \) are labeled on or within the circle.
  - Lines \( DE \) and \( CE \) form chords in the circle.
  - Angles are labeled at points \( E \) and \( C \).

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations**:
  - The angle at point \( E \) is labeled as \( 3x^\circ \).
  - The angle at point \( C \) is labeled as \( (5x - 12)^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No specific markings for parallel, perpendicular, or congruence are visible.
  - The figure suggests that \( DE \) and \( CE \) are chords intersecting inside the circle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( DE \) and \( CE \) are chords of the circle.
  - The angles \( \angle DEB \) and \( \angle CEB \) are formed by the intersection of these chords.
  - The angles \( \angle DEB \) and \( \angle CEB \) are part of the cyclic quadrilateral \( CDEE' \) (where \( E' \) is the intersection of the extensions of \( DE \) and \( CE \)).

- **Implied Constraints**:
  - The angles \( \angle DEB \) and \( \angle CEB \) are related by the properties of intersecting chords in a circle.
  - The sum of the measures of opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle DEB = 3x^\circ \)
  - \( \angle CEB = (5x - 12)^\circ \)

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - Since \( \angle DEB \) and \( \angle CEB \) are supplementary angles (they form a linear pair at point \( E \)):
    \[
    \angle DEB + \angle CEB = 180^\circ
    \]
  - Substituting the given expressions:
    \[
    3x + (5x - 12) = 180
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks to find the value of \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The property of supplementary angles is key here. The angles \( \angle DEB \) and \( \angle CEB \) add up to \( 180^\circ \).

- **Information Needed**:
  - The relationship between the angles \( 3x \) and \( 5x - 12 \) must be used to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the points, lines, and angles.
  - Represent the supplementary angle relationship.
  - Ensure all visible relationships are captured without solving for \( x \) directly.
