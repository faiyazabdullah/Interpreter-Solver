REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure is a trapezoid labeled \(ABCD\).
  - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are the vertices of the trapezoid.
  - Points \(S\) and \(T\) are marked on the legs \(AC\) and \(BD\), respectively.

- **Lines**:
  - \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are the sides of the trapezoid.
  - \(ST\) is a line segment connecting the midpoints \(S\) and \(T\) of the non-parallel sides \(AC\) and \(BD\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No right angle symbols or congruence marks are visible.
  - \(AB\) and \(CD\) appear to be the parallel bases of the trapezoid.
  - \(S\) and \(T\) are marked as midpoints of the non-parallel sides.

- **Measurements**:
  - \(AB = x + 4\)
  - \(CD = 3x + 2\)
  - \(ST = 9\)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel sides (bases) of the trapezoid.
  - \(AC\) and \(BD\) are the non-parallel sides (legs) of the trapezoid.
  - \(S\) and \(T\) are midpoints of the legs \(AC\) and \(BD\), respectively.
  - \(ST\) is the midsegment of the trapezoid, which connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides.

- **Implied Properties**:
  - The midsegment \(ST\) of a trapezoid is parallel to the bases \(AB\) and \(CD\).
  - The length of the midsegment \(ST\) is the average of the lengths of the two bases:
    \[
    ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \(AB = x + 4\)
  - \(CD = 3x + 2\)
  - \(ST = 9\)

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - The midsegment formula relates \(ST\) to \(AB\) and \(CD\):
    \[
    ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
    \]
  - Substituting the given values:
    \[
    9 = \frac{(x + 4) + (3x + 2)}{2}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of \(AB\).
- To solve this, we need to use the midsegment property of the trapezoid:
  \[
  ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
  \]
- We are given \(ST = 9\), \(AB = x + 4\), and \(CD = 3x + 2\). Substituting these into the formula will allow us to solve for \(x\) and then find \(AB\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- Predicates should capture the trapezoid structure, the midsegment property, and the given measurements without directly solving for the final answer.
