================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image contains a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are labeled.
  - Lines \( AC \), \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( BD \) are drawn.
  - \( BD \) is perpendicular to \( AC \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \( AC = 8.8 \) units.
  - \( BC = 8.5 \) units.
  - \( BD = y \) (to be determined).
  - \( AD = x \) (not explicitly given but part of \( AC \)).
  - \( DC = z \) (not explicitly given but part of \( AC \)).

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle BDA \), indicating \( BD \perp AC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a triangle with sides \( AC \), \( AB \), and \( BC \).
  - \( BD \) is the altitude from \( B \) to \( AC \), dividing \( \triangle ABC \) into two right triangles: \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BDC \).
  - Since \( BD \perp AC \), \( \angle BDA \) and \( \angle BDC \) are right angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AC = 8.8 \) units.
  - \( BC = 8.5 \) units.
  - \( BD = y \) (to be found).
  - \( AD = x \) and \( DC = z \) are parts of \( AC \), so \( x + z = 8.8 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \), the length of \( BD \).
- To find \( y \), we use the geometric properties of right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BDC \) and \( \triangle ABD \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- The key relationships involve the right angles, the lengths of the sides, and the division of \( \triangle ABC \) by the altitude \( BD \).
