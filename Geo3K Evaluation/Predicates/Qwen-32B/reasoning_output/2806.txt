================================================================================
QUESTION: Find \angle C of quadrilateral A B C D.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are the vertices of the quadrilateral.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  
- **Angles**:
  - Angles at vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are labeled or indicated.
  - \(\angle A\) is labeled as \(3x^\circ\).
  - \(\angle D\) is labeled as \(x^\circ\).
  - \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) are both marked with right angle symbols (\(\perp\)), indicating they are \(90^\circ\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols at \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) indicate these angles are \(90^\circ\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties**:
  - Since two adjacent angles (\(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\)) are right angles, the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
  - In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, and all interior angles are \(90^\circ\).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).
  - Given \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle C = 90^\circ\), the remaining angles \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) must satisfy the equation:
    \[
    \angle A + \angle D + \angle B + \angle C = 360^\circ.
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    3x + x + 90 + 90 = 360.
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \(\angle A = 3x^\circ\).
  - \(\angle D = x^\circ\).
  - \(\angle B = 90^\circ\).
  - \(\angle C = 90^\circ\).

- **Equation from Angle Sum**:
  - From the equation \(3x + x + 90 + 90 = 360\), we can solve for \(x\):
    \[
    4x + 180 = 360 \implies 4x = 180 \implies x = 45.
    \]
  - Therefore, \(\angle A = 3x = 3 \times 45 = 135^\circ\) and \(\angle D = x = 45^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle C\).
- From the image and analysis, \(\angle C\) is explicitly marked as a right angle (\(90^\circ\)).
- However, we also confirm this using the fact that \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, where all interior angles are \(90^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- The predicates should capture the shape, angles, and relationships without directly stating the final answer.
