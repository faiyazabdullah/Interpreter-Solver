================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is depicted with center \( F \).
  - Chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect at point \( E \) inside the circle.
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are labeled.
  - Segments \( AE \), \( EC \), \( BE \), and \( ED \) are formed by the intersection of chords.

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( AE = x \)
  - \( EC = 3 \)
  - \( BE = 4 \)
  - \( ED = 6 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence indicators are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( AB \) and \( CD \) are chords of the circle.
  - The intersection of two chords inside a circle creates segments whose products are equal according to the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**.
    \[
    AE \cdot EC = BE \cdot ED
    \]
  - The theorem states that the product of the lengths of the segments created by the intersection of two chords is equal.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( AE = x \)
  - \( EC = 3 \)
  - \( BE = 4 \)
  - \( ED = 6 \)

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - According to the Intersecting Chords Theorem:
    \[
    AE \cdot EC = BE \cdot ED
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    x \cdot 3 = 4 \cdot 6
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we use the Intersecting Chords Theorem and solve the resulting equation:
  \[
  x \cdot 3 = 4 \cdot 6
  \]
  \[
  3x = 24
  \]
  \[
  x = 8
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Geometric Relationships:**
  - Define points, lines, and the circle.
  - Represent the chords and their segments.
  - Capture the Intersecting Chords Theorem relationship without explicitly solving for \( x \).
