QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram consists of a large triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is an additional point \( E \) inside the triangle, creating smaller triangles and segments.
  - Lines are drawn from \( E \) to vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments \( AE \), \( BE \), and \( CE \) are visible.
  - Line segment \( AB \) is one side of the triangle.
  - Line segment \( BC \) is another side of the triangle.
  - Line segment \( AC \) is the third side of the triangle.

- **Angles:**
  - Angles are labeled at various vertices:
    - \( \angle DAB = 95^\circ \)
    - \( \angle CAB = 33^\circ \)
    - \( \angle CBE = 109^\circ \)
    - \( \angle EBC = 24^\circ \)
    - \( \angle 2 \) is the angle at vertex \( A \) formed by lines \( AE \) and \( AB \).

- **Labels and Numbers:**
  - The numbers 1, 2, 3 appear to label specific segments or angles, but they do not seem to provide direct measurements beyond identifying parts of the diagram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is the main triangle.
  - Smaller triangles are formed by point \( E \):
    - \( \triangle ABE \)
    - \( \triangle BCE \)
    - \( \triangle ACE \)

- **Angles:**
  - The sum of angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The angles at point \( E \) form linear pairs or are part of the larger triangle's internal angles.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings indicate parallel lines, perpendicular lines, or congruent segments. All relationships must be deduced from angle measures and triangle properties.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles:**
  - \( \angle DAB = 95^\circ \)
  - \( \angle CAB = 33^\circ \)
  - \( \angle CBE = 109^\circ \)
  - \( \angle EBC = 24^\circ \)

- **Unknown Angle:**
  - The measure of \( \angle 2 \) (denoted as \( \angle BAE \)) needs to be determined.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 2 \).
- To find \( \angle 2 \), we need to use the properties of angles in a triangle and the fact that the sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
- Specifically, \( \angle 2 \) is part of \( \triangle ABE \), and we can use the given angles to find it.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and angle measures in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the structure of the triangles, the angles, and their measures.
- The goal is to set up the problem so that the measure of \( \angle 2 \) can be deduced from the given information.
