================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - Two rectangles are visible in the image: one larger rectangle \(ABCD\) and one smaller rectangle \(EFGH\).
  - Points \(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\) are labeled.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Horizontal lines: \(AB\), \(EF\), \(GH\).
  - Vertical lines: \(AD\), \(BC\), \(EH\), \(FG\).
  - Other segments: \(BE\), \(CF\), \(DG\).

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - \(AD = x\)
  - \(DG = 7.5\)
  - \(AG = x + DG = x + 7.5\)
  - \(BE = 5\)
  - \(BC = x - 2\)

- **Special Markings**:
  - The rectangles appear to have right angles at all corners, indicating they are indeed rectangles.
  - The problem states that the two rectangles are similar.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similarity of Rectangles**:
  - Since the rectangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional. This means:
    \[
    \frac{\text{Length of } AD}{\text{Length of } EH} = \frac{\text{Length of } AG}{\text{Length of } EF}
    \]
  - The corresponding sides are:
    - \(AD\) and \(EH\)
    - \(AG\) and \(EF\)
    - \(BC\) and \(FG\)
    - \(DG\) and \(HG\)

- **Proportional Relationships**:
  - The similarity implies:
    \[
    \frac{x}{EH} = \frac{x + 7.5}{EF}
    \]
    \[
    \frac{x - 2}{FG} = \frac{x}{EH}
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \(AD = x\)
  - \(DG = 7.5\)
  - \(AG = x + 7.5\)
  - \(BE = 5\) (height of the smaller rectangle)
  - \(BC = x - 2\) (width of the smaller rectangle)

- **Relationships**:
  - The height of the larger rectangle \(EH\) is equal to the height of the smaller rectangle \(BE\), i.e., \(EH = 5\).
  - The width of the larger rectangle \(EF\) is equal to the sum of the widths of the smaller rectangles, i.e., \(EF = x + 7.5\).
  - The width of the smaller rectangle is \(x - 2\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks to find the value of \(x\).
- Using the similarity of the rectangles, we set up the proportionality equation:
  \[
  \frac{x}{5} = \frac{x - 2}{7.5}
  \]
- Solving this equation will give us the value of \(x\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric shapes, their dimensions, and the similarity relationship in atomic predicates.
- The predicates should capture the structure of the rectangles, their dimensions, and the proportional relationships without directly solving for \(x\).
