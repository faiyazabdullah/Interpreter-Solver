REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains several triangles and straight lines.
  - Key points labeled: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \).
  - Triangles include \( \triangle ABC \), \( \triangle BFG \), and \( \triangle DEG \).

- **Lines**:
  - Straight lines connecting points, such as \( DE \), \( GH \), and \( BF \).

- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - Angles are labeled at specific points:
    - \( \angle DBC = 50^\circ \)
    - \( \angle CBG = 78^\circ \)
    - \( \angle BGF = 120^\circ \)
    - \( \angle EGA = 56^\circ \)
  - The angle \( \angle 3 \) is part of \( \triangle BFG \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No special markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruence are visible.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle BFG \) is formed by points \( B, F, G \).
  - \( \triangle DEG \) is formed by points \( D, E, G \).
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is formed by points \( A, B, C \).

- **Connections**:
  - Point \( G \) is common to both \( \triangle BFG \) and \( \triangle DEG \).
  - Line segments \( BF \) and \( BG \) form part of \( \triangle BFG \).
  - Line segments \( DG \) and \( EG \) form part of \( \triangle DEG \).

- **Constraints**:
  - The angles around point \( B \) sum up to \( 180^\circ \) because they lie on a straight line.
  - Similarly, the angles around point \( G \) must satisfy the properties of the triangles involved.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle DBC = 50^\circ \)
  - \( \angle CBG = 78^\circ \)
  - \( \angle BGF = 120^\circ \)
  - \( \angle EGA = 56^\circ \)

- **Unknowns**:
  - We need to find \( \angle 3 \), which is one of the angles in \( \triangle BFG \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 3 \) in \( \triangle BFG \).
- To solve this, we need to use the angle sum property of triangles and the relationships between the angles around points \( B \) and \( G \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will include:
  - Definitions of triangles and lines.
  - Labeling of angles and their measures.
  - Relationships between angles around points \( B \) and \( G \).
