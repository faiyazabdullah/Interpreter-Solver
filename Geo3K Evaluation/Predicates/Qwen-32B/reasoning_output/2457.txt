STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2457
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use a Pythagorean Triple to find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The vertices are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( B \), indicated by the right angle symbol.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( AB \) is one of the legs of the triangle, and its length is \( x \).
  - \( BC \) is another leg of the triangle, and its length is 24.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and its length is 74.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle at \( B \) indicates that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = x \) (unknown length to be determined).
  - \( BC = 24 \) (one leg of the triangle).
  - \( AC = 74 \) (hypotenuse of the triangle).

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - According to the Pythagorean theorem, the relationship between the sides of the triangle is:
    \[
    AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    x^2 + 24^2 = 74^2
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks us to use a Pythagorean triple to find the value of \( x \).
  - We need to solve for \( x \) using the Pythagorean theorem and verify if the resulting triple \( (x, 24, 74) \) is a valid Pythagorean triple.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and its properties.
  - Indicate the right angle at \( B \).
  - Specify the lengths of the sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \).
  - Capture the relationship between the sides using the Pythagorean theorem.
