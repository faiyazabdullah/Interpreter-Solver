QUESTION: Find m \angle R.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( R, Q, T, S \).
  
- **Points**:
  - Four points: \( R, Q, T, S \).

- **Lines**:
  - Four sides: \( RQ, QT, TS, SR \).

- **Angles**:
  - Angles at each vertex are labeled:
    - \( \angle R = x^\circ \)
    - \( \angle Q = (2x + 5)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle T = x^\circ \)
    - \( \angle S = (2x + 7)^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The interior angles are expressed in terms of \( x \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Quadrilateral Properties**:
  - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \( 360^\circ \).
  - The given angles are \( x, 2x + 5, x, 2x + 7 \).

- **Constraints**:
  - The quadrilateral is not specified as any particular type (e.g., rectangle, rhombus), so we assume it is a general quadrilateral.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The angles are given as expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( \angle R = x \)
    - \( \angle Q = 2x + 5 \)
    - \( \angle T = x \)
    - \( \angle S = 2x + 7 \).

- **Relationships**:
  - The sum of the interior angles must satisfy:
    \[
    x + (2x + 5) + x + (2x + 7) = 360^\circ.
    \]

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle R \), denoted as \( m\angle R \).
- To find \( m\angle R \), we need to solve for \( x \) using the sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the given information in terms of predicates, ensuring that all relationships and constraints are captured.
- Predicates will include the quadrilateral, its vertices, sides, angles, and the relationship that the sum of the interior angles equals \( 360^\circ \).
