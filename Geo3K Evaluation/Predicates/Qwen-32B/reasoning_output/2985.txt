REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains two right triangles: \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEC \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E \) are labeled.
  - Line segments \( AB, BC, AC, DE, EC, DC \) are shown.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - \( AB \perp BC \): There is a right angle at \( B \).
  - \( DE \perp EC \): There is a right angle at \( D \).
  - Lines \( AC \) and \( EC \) appear to be hypotenuses of their respective triangles.

- **Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 4 \) units.
  - \( BC = x + 7 \) units.
  - \( DE = 12 - x \) units.
  - \( DC = 6 \) units.
  - \( EC = 4 \) units.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols at \( B \) and \( D \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AB \perp BC \).
  - \( \triangle DEC \) is a right triangle with \( DE \perp EC \).
  - The problem states that the two triangles are similar, implying proportional sides and equal angles.

- **Similarity:**
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEC \), the corresponding sides are proportional:
    \[
    \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EC} = \frac{AC}{DC}
    \]

- **Connections:**
  - Point \( C \) is the common vertex shared by both triangles.
  - The hypotenuses \( AC \) and \( EC \) are aligned along the same line.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 4 \)
  - \( BC = x + 7 \)
  - \( DE = 12 - x \)
  - \( DC = 6 \)
  - \( EC = 4 \)

- **Unknowns:**
  - The value of \( x \) needs to be determined from the similarity condition.
  - The length of \( AC \) is the primary goal.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks for the length of \( AC \).
- To find \( AC \), we use the similarity of the triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEC \). The similarity implies:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EC} = \frac{AC}{DC}
  \]
- We need to determine \( x \) first using the proportionality of the sides, then use it to find \( AC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the geometric shapes, points, lines, and angles.
- Capture the similarity relationship and the given measurements.
- Ensure all visible relationships and constraints are included.
