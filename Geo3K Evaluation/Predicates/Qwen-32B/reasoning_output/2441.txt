================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 3 = 110 and m \angle 12 = 55. Find the measure of \angle 1.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains multiple lines intersecting at various points.
  - There are labeled points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L \).
  - Angles are marked at intersections, numbered from 1 to 16.
  - Two angles are explicitly labeled with measures: \( m\angle 3 = 110^\circ \) and \( m\angle 12 = 55^\circ \).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Lines are drawn connecting points, forming multiple intersecting segments.
  - Angles are formed at the intersections of these lines.
  - Specific angles are marked with numbers (e.g., \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \ldots, \angle 16 \)).
  - Some angles have additional markings (e.g., pink triangles, right-angle symbols).

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right-angle symbol is present at \( \angle 12 \), indicating it is a right angle.
  - No explicit indication of parallel or perpendicular lines is visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements**:
  - The lines appear to form a network of intersecting segments.
  - Angles are formed where lines intersect.
  - Given the right-angle symbol at \( \angle 12 \), we know \( \angle 12 = 90^\circ \).
  - The angles \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 12 \) are explicitly measured.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Adjacent angles formed by intersecting lines are supplementary if they form a linear pair.
  - Vertical angles are congruent.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( m\angle 3 = 110^\circ \).
  - \( m\angle 12 = 55^\circ \) (but note the right-angle symbol indicates \( \angle 12 = 90^\circ \); this discrepancy needs clarification).

- **Interpretation**:
  - The angle \( \angle 12 \) is marked as both \( 55^\circ \) and a right angle. Assuming the right-angle symbol takes precedence, \( \angle 12 = 90^\circ \).
  - The measure of \( \angle 3 = 110^\circ \) is consistent with the diagram.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - Find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - Angles around a point sum to \( 360^\circ \).
  - Adjacent angles formed by intersecting lines are supplementary.
  - Vertical angles are congruent.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent all points, lines, and angles.
  - Capture the given angle measures (\( \angle 3 = 110^\circ \) and \( \angle 12 = 90^\circ \)).
  - Include relationships such as supplementary angles and vertical angles.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are captured.
