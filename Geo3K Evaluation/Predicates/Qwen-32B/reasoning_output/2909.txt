REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a triangle \( XYZ \) with vertices \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \).
  - Another triangle \( WXZ \) is formed by extending the sides of \( XYZ \).

- **Lines:**
  - Lines \( XY \), \( YZ \), \( ZX \), \( WX \), and \( WZ \) are visible.

- **Angles:**
  - Angles are labeled as follows:
    - \( \angle YXZ = 105^\circ \)
    - \( \angle WXZ = 23^\circ \)
    - \( \angle XZV = 24^\circ \)
    - Angle \( \angle 1 \) at vertex \( Y \) is the target angle to find.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings for parallel, perpendicular, or congruent lines are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles:**
  - \( \triangle XYZ \) and \( \triangle WXZ \) are the primary triangles.
  - \( \triangle WXZ \) shares the side \( XZ \) with \( \triangle XYZ \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - The sum of angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - External angles are formed by extending sides of the triangle, and they are related to the internal angles.

- **Key Observations:**
  - \( \angle WXZ = 23^\circ \) is an external angle for \( \triangle XYZ \) at vertex \( X \).
  - \( \angle XZV = 24^\circ \) is another external angle for \( \triangle XYZ \) at vertex \( Z \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \angle YXZ = 105^\circ \)
  - \( \angle WXZ = 23^\circ \)
  - \( \angle XZV = 24^\circ \)

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( \angle WXZ \) is an external angle, it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles of \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - Similarly, \( \angle XZV \) is another external angle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle 1 \), which is the measure of angle \( \angle 1 \) at vertex \( Y \) in \( \triangle XYZ \).
- To find \( m\angle 1 \), we need to use the angle sum property of triangles and the relationships between internal and external angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The predicates will include:
  - Definitions of triangles and points.
  - Specifying angles and their measures.
  - Relationships between internal and external angles.
