REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present.
  - Points \( A, B, C, D \) are labeled on the circle.
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) form a triangle inscribed in the circle.
  - Line segment \( BD \) is drawn from point \( B \) to point \( D \) on the circle.
  - An angle \( \angle 2 \) is formed at point \( D \) by the intersection of lines \( BD \) and \( DA \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - No specific numerical measurements are provided for lengths or angles.
  - The angle \( \angle 2 \) is explicitly labeled.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No special markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence are visible.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle, indicating they are points on the same circle.
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed in the circle.
  - \( BD \) and \( DA \) are chords of the circle.
  - \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( BA \).

- **Implied Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.
  - Since \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( BA \), its measure depends on the measure of arc \( BA \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Information:**
  - No numerical values are given for lengths or angles.
  - The only measurement-related detail is the relationship between inscribed angles and their corresponding arcs.

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is determined by the arc \( BA \). However, without additional information about the arc or another angle related to it, we cannot compute a numerical value for \( \angle 2 \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 2 \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.
  - To find \( m\angle 2 \), we need the measure of arc \( BA \) or another angle related to it.

- **Information Needed:**
  - The measure of arc \( BA \) or another angle that helps determine \( m\angle 2 \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the circle and its points.
  - Indicate that \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed in the circle.
  - Specify that \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( BA \).
  - Capture the general property that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc.

- **Completeness Check:**
  - All visible elements and relationships are represented.
  - No additional assumptions are made beyond what is shown in the diagram.
