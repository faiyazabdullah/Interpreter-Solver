REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle centered at point \( X \).
  - Four points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Two chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) are drawn, intersecting at point \( M \).
  - Two additional segments \( CN \) and \( ND \) are drawn within the circle, with \( N \) lying on \( CD \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Chords \( AB \) and \( CD \) are shown with lengths \( AB = 30 \) and \( CD = 30 \).
  - Segment \( CN \) and \( ND \) are parts of the chord \( CD \).
  - Line segments \( AM \) and \( BM \) are parts of chord \( AB \).
  - Line segments \( CM \) and \( DM \) are parts of chord \( CD \).

- **Angles:**
  - Angles \( \angle AMB \) and \( \angle CMD \) are marked as right angles.
  - Angle \( \angle CZD \) is marked as \( 40^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols indicate \( \angle AMB \) and \( \angle CMD \) are right angles.
  - The arc \( \widehat{CZ} \) is explicitly mentioned with measure \( 40^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Chords and Circle Properties:**
  - Both \( AB \) and \( CD \) are equal-length chords (\( AB = CD = 30 \)).
  - Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect at \( M \), the Power of a Point theorem applies:
    \[
    AM \cdot MB = CM \cdot MD
    \]
  - The right angles at \( M \) suggest perpendicularity between the intersecting chords.

- **Arc and Central Angle Relationship:**
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{CZ} \) is \( 40^\circ \). This implies the central angle subtended by \( \widehat{CZ} \) is also \( 40^\circ \).

- **Segment Division:**
  - Point \( N \) divides chord \( CD \) into two segments: \( CN \) and \( ND \).
  - Since \( M \) is the intersection point, it may be the midpoint of one or both chords due to symmetry.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 30 \)
  - \( CD = 30 \)
  - \( m\widehat{CZ} = 40^\circ \)

- **Derived Information:**
  - Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are equal chords, they are equidistant from the center \( X \).
  - The right angles at \( M \) imply perpendicular bisectors, suggesting \( M \) could be the midpoint of both chords.
  - The arc \( \widehat{CZ} \) provides a direct measurement of the central angle subtended by \( CZ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length \( ND \).
- To solve this, we need to use the given information about the circle, the equal chords, and the right angles at the intersection point \( M \).
- The key relationships involve the Power of a Point theorem, the division of the chord \( CD \) by point \( N \), and the symmetry of the circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will capture the circle, chords, right angles, arc measures, and segment divisions.
- The solution will rely on these relationships without directly stating the final answer.
