REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
- **Lines**: There are several lines connecting the points:
  - Line segment \( CD \) with point \( B \) lying on it.
  - Line segments \( CE \) and \( EA \) forming a triangle \( CEA \).
  - Line segments \( CB \) and \( BA \) forming another triangle \( CBA \).
- **Angles**: The diagram explicitly labels three angles:
  - \( \angle 6 \) (formed by lines \( CB \) and \( BD \)).
  - \( \angle 7 \) (formed by lines \( CB \) and \( BA \)).
  - \( \angle 8 \) (formed by lines \( BA \) and \( AD \)).
- **Measurements**: The measures of angles are partially given:
  - \( m \angle 8 = 47^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are stated to be complementary.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Complementary Angles**: Since \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are complementary, their measures sum to \( 90^\circ \):
  \[
  m \angle 6 + m \angle 8 = 90^\circ.
  \]
- **Linear Pair**: Angles \( \angle 6 \), \( \angle 7 \), and \( \angle 8 \) form a linear pair around point \( B \). Therefore, their measures sum to \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  m \angle 6 + m \angle 7 + m \angle 8 = 180^\circ.
  \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- From the problem statement:
  - \( m \angle 8 = 47^\circ \).
- Using the complementary relationship:
  \[
  m \angle 6 = 90^\circ - m \angle 8 = 90^\circ - 47^\circ = 43^\circ.
  \]
- Using the linear pair relationship:
  \[
  m \angle 6 + m \angle 7 + m \angle 8 = 180^\circ.
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  43^\circ + m \angle 7 + 47^\circ = 180^\circ.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  m \angle 7 = 180^\circ - 43^\circ - 47^\circ = 90^\circ.
  \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 7 \).
- To find \( m \angle 7 \), we use the relationships between complementary angles and the linear pair property.
- The key relationships are:
  1. \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are complementary.
  2. \( \angle 6 \), \( \angle 7 \), and \( \angle 8 \) form a linear pair.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the relationships between the angles, their measures, and the complementary and linear pair properties.
