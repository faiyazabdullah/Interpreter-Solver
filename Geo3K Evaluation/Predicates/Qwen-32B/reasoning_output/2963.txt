STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2963
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, C P is an altitude, C Q is the angle bisector of \angle A C B, and R is the midpoint of A B. Find m \angle A C Q if m \angle A C B = 123 - x and m \angle Q C B = 42 + x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is shown.
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Points \( P \), \( Q \), and \( R \) are additional points inside the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( CP \) is drawn from vertex \( C \) to side \( AB \).
  - \( CQ \) is drawn from vertex \( C \) to side \( AB \).
  - \( CR \) is drawn from vertex \( C \) to side \( AB \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( CP \) is labeled as an altitude, meaning it is perpendicular to \( AB \).
  - \( CQ \) is labeled as the angle bisector of \( \angle ACB \).
  - \( R \) is labeled as the midpoint of \( AB \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle ACB \) is given as \( 123 - x \).
  - \( \angle QCB \) is given as \( 42 + x \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Altitude:**
  - \( CP \) is perpendicular to \( AB \). Thus, \( \angle CPA = \angle CPB = 90^\circ \).

- **Angle Bisector:**
  - \( CQ \) bisects \( \angle ACB \), so \( \angle ACQ = \angle QCB \).

- **Midpoint:**
  - \( R \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), so \( AR = RB \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - Since \( CQ \) is the angle bisector, \( \angle ACQ = \angle QCB \).
  - Given \( \angle ACB = 123 - x \) and \( \angle QCB = 42 + x \), we can use these to find \( \angle ACQ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \angle ACB = 123 - x \).
  - \( \angle QCB = 42 + x \).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \( CQ \) is the angle bisector, \( \angle ACQ = \angle QCB \).
  - Therefore, \( \angle ACQ = 42 + x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks us to find \( m \angle ACQ \).
- We know:
  - \( \angle ACB = 123 - x \).
  - \( \angle QCB = 42 + x \).
  - \( CQ \) is the angle bisector, so \( \angle ACQ = \angle QCB \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will include:
  - The triangle and its vertices.
  - The altitude, angle bisector, and midpoint.
  - The given angle measures and their relationships.
