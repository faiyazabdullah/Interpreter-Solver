### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains several labeled points: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), \( F \), \( G \), \( H \).
- **Lines**: Several lines connect these points, forming multiple segments such as \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( DE \), \( EF \), \( FG \), \( GH \), \( HA \), and others.
- **Angles**: There are specific angles labeled:
  - \( \angle BOF = (7x + 9)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle DOA = (7y - 4)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle AOE = (11x - 1)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle DOE = (2y + 5)^\circ \)
- **Special Markings**: There are no explicit markings for parallelism, perpendicularity, or congruence. However, the context suggests that the angles around point \( O \) are related.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Angles Around a Point**: The angles \( \angle BOF \), \( \angle DOA \), \( \angle AOE \), and \( \angle DOE \) are all around point \( O \). The sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
- **Linear Relationships**: The relationships between \( x \) and \( y \) are given through the expressions involving these angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**: The angles are expressed in terms of variables \( x \) and \( y \):
  - \( \angle BOF = (7x + 9)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle DOA = (7y - 4)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle AOE = (11x - 1)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle DOE = (2y + 5)^\circ \)
- These expressions need to be combined to satisfy the property that the sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we need to use the relationship that the sum of the angles around point \( O \) is \( 360^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle BOF + \angle DOA + \angle AOE + \angle DOE = 360^\circ
  \]
- Substituting the given expressions:
  \[
  (7x + 9) + (7y - 4) + (11x - 1) + (2y + 5) = 360
  \]
- Simplify and solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and angle measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key relationships involve the angles around point \( O \) and their sum being \( 360^\circ \).
