REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is shown with center \( W \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( AB, CD, EF \) are chords of the circle.
  - Right angles are marked at points \( C \) and \( F \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( ED = 30 \).
  - \( CW = WF \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angles at \( \angle ACB \) and \( \angle EFD \).
  - \( CW = WF \) implies \( W \) is the midpoint of \( CF \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Circles and Chords:**
  - \( AB, CD, EF \) are chords of the circle.
  - Since \( \angle ACB \) and \( \angle EFD \) are right angles, the chords \( AB \) and \( EF \) subtend diameters of the circle. Therefore, \( AB \) and \( EF \) are diameters of the circle.

- **Midpoints and Symmetry:**
  - \( CW = WF \) indicates that \( W \) is the midpoint of \( CF \). This symmetry is consistent with \( W \) being the center of the circle.

- **Right Angles and Diameters:**
  - A right angle inscribed in a semicircle implies that the hypotenuse is the diameter of the circle. Thus, \( AB \) and \( EF \) are diameters.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( ED = 30 \).
  - \( CW = WF \).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \( W \) is the center of the circle and \( CW = WF \), \( CF \) is a diameter of the circle.
  - \( ED \) is part of the chord \( EF \), and since \( EF \) is a diameter, \( ED \) is half the length of the diameter minus the segment \( DF \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the length of \( DF \).
- From the analysis, we know:
  - \( EF \) is a diameter.
  - \( ED = 30 \).
  - \( W \) is the midpoint of \( CF \), so \( CF \) is twice the radius.
  - Using the properties of the circle and the given right angles, we can determine \( DF \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the structure of the circle, the diameters, the right angles, and the given lengths.
