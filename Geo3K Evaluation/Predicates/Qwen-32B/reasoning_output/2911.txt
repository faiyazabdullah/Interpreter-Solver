================================================================================
QUESTION: If c = 5, find b.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure consists of a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Sides**:
  - \( AB \) is one side of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is another side of the triangle.
  - \( CA \) is the third side of the triangle.
  
- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \) (implied by the right angle symbol).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( c \): The hypotenuse \( AB \) is labeled as \( c \).
  - \( a \): The side \( BC \) is labeled as \( a \).
  - \( b \): The side \( CA \) is labeled as \( b \).
  - Given: \( c = 5 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol at \( \angle BCA \), indicating \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \).
  - The angles \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) indicate that \( \triangle ABC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle.
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( c = 5 \): The hypotenuse \( AB \) is 5 units long.
  
- **Implications**:
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle:
    - The side opposite the 30-degree angle (\( a \)) is half the hypotenuse.
    - The side opposite the 60-degree angle (\( b \)) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) times the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of \( b \), the side opposite the 60-degree angle.
- Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:
  - \( a = \frac{c}{2} \)
  - \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot c \)

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the structure of the triangle, the right angle, the angles, and the side ratios without directly solving for \( b \).
