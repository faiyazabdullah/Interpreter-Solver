QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a large right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a smaller right triangle \( \triangle ADE \) within \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points labeled: \( A, B, C, D, E \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( BC \) is one leg of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( AC \) is the other leg of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( AD \) is one leg of \( \triangle ADE \).
  - \( DE \) is the other leg of \( \triangle ADE \).
  - \( AE \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ADE \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( BC = 12 \).
  - \( CE = 5 \).
  - \( AD = 4 \).
  - \( AB = x \) (to be found).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols are present at \( \angle ABC \), \( \angle ADE \), and \( \angle CED \).
  - This indicates that both \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle ADE \) are right triangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle ADE \) are similar triangles because they share the same angles (AA similarity criterion):
    - \( \angle BAC = \angle DAE \) (common angle).
    - \( \angle ABC = \angle ADE = 90^\circ \).
    - \( \angle ACB = \angle AED \) (corresponding angles).
  - The sides of similar triangles are proportional.

- **Constraints**:
  - \( \triangle ADE \) is a scaled-down version of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The ratio of corresponding sides of similar triangles is constant.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( BC = 12 \).
  - \( CE = 5 \).
  - \( AD = 4 \).
  - \( AB = x \) (to be found).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - Since \( \triangle ADE \sim \triangle ABC \), the ratio of corresponding sides is:
    \[
    \frac{AD}{AB} = \frac{DE}{BC} = \frac{AE}{AC}.
    \]
  - \( DE \) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle CDE \):
    \[
    DE = \sqrt{CE^2 + CD^2}.
    \]
    However, we do not need \( DE \) explicitly since the similarity ratio will suffice.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AB \), denoted as \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we use the similarity of \( \triangle ADE \) and \( \triangle ABC \):
  - The ratio of the hypotenuses \( AE \) and \( AC \) is equal to the ratio of the corresponding legs \( AD \) and \( AB \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships, similarity, and measurements using atomic predicates.
- The key relationships are the similarity of triangles and the proportionality of their sides.
