REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is present.
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are marked on the circle.
  - Lines \( AB, CD, EF \) are chords of the circle.
  - Lines \( CE \) and \( DF \) are diameters of the circle, as they pass through the center and are perpendicular to the chords \( AB \) and \( DF \).

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - Chord \( AB \) has a length represented as \( 9x \).
  - Chord \( DF \) has a length represented as \( 2x + 14 \).
  - The diameters \( CE \) and \( DF \) are perpendicular to the chords \( AB \) and \( DF \), respectively.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols are present where the diameters intersect the chords, indicating perpendicularity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The diameters \( CE \) and \( DF \) are perpendicular to the chords \( AB \) and \( DF \), respectively.
  - Since \( AB \cong DF \), the lengths of the chords \( AB \) and \( DF \) are equal.
  - The circle is symmetric, and the diameters divide the chords into two equal halves.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - Length of chord \( AB \): \( 9x \).
  - Length of chord \( DF \): \( 2x + 14 \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - Since \( AB \cong DF \), the lengths of \( AB \) and \( DF \) are equal. Therefore, we have the equation:
    \[
    9x = 2x + 14
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question states that \( AB \cong DF \), meaning the lengths of the chords \( AB \) and \( DF \) are equal.
- We need to find the value of \( x \) using the given lengths of the chords.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The key relationships involve the equality of the lengths of the chords \( AB \) and \( DF \).
- The predicates should capture the geometric shapes, points, lines, and the equality of the chord lengths.
