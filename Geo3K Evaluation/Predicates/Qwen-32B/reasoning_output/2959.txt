QUESTION: Find the area of the rhombus.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The figure is a rhombus \(ABCD\).
- **Points**: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are the vertices of the rhombus.
- **Lines**: 
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).
  - The diagonals are marked with dashed lines and perpendicular cross-hatching, indicating they are perpendicular to each other.
- **Measurements**:
  - One diagonal \(AC\) is labeled as \(12 \, \text{m}\).
  - The other diagonal \(BD\) is labeled as \(11 \, \text{m}\).
- **Special Markings**:
  - The diagonals are shown to intersect at right angles (\(\perp\)).
  - The diagonals bisect each other (as indicated by the midpoints).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rhombus Properties**:
  - All sides are equal in length.
  - Diagonals are perpendicular (\(AC \perp BD\)).
  - Diagonals bisect each other at the point of intersection (\(E\)).
- **Constraints**:
  - The diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.
  - The lengths of the diagonals are given as \(12 \, \text{m}\) and \(11 \, \text{m}\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - One diagonal \(AC = 12 \, \text{m}\).
  - The other diagonal \(BD = 11 \, \text{m}\).
- **Interpretation**:
  - Since the diagonals bisect each other, the segments created are:
    - \(AE = EC = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \, \text{m}\).
    - \(BE = ED = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \, \text{m}\).
  - These segments form the legs of the right triangles within the rhombus.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **area of the rhombus**.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
    \]
    where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.
  - Here, \(d_1 = 12 \, \text{m}\) and \(d_2 = 11 \, \text{m}\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the rhombus and its vertices.
  - Indicate the diagonals and their perpendicularity.
  - Specify the lengths of the diagonals.
  - Capture the bisection property of the diagonals.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are represented.
