================================================================================

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:  
  - The main shape is a quadrilateral labeled \(WXYZ\).
  - There are additional triangles formed within the quadrilateral, specifically involving diagonals and internal segments.
  - Key points are labeled: \(W, X, Y, Z, A\).

- **Lines and Segments**:  
  - Diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) intersect at point \(A\).
  - Other segments include \(WZ\), \(XY\), and smaller internal segments connecting the vertices and intersection point \(A\).

- **Angles and Measurements**:  
  - Angles are labeled as \(1, 5\).
  - Specific measurements are not provided for lengths, but angle measures are given: \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
  - Right angles are indicated at vertices \(W, Y, X, Z\), confirming the quadrilateral is a rectangle.

- **Special Markings**:  
  - Right-angle symbols at \(W, Y, X, Z\) indicate that the quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:  
  - \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all interior angles are \(90^\circ\).
  - Diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) are congruent and bisect each other.
  - Triangles \(WAX\) and \(WAY\) are formed by the diagonals and sides of the rectangle.
  - Angles around point \(A\) are related due to the properties of intersecting lines and the rectangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:  
  - \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\): This is explicitly given.
  - No explicit lengths are provided for segments, but the relationships between angles can be analyzed.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle 5\).
- Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, we know:
  - Diagonals bisect each other.
  - Opposite angles formed by the diagonals are equal.
  - Adjacent angles formed by the diagonals are supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).
- The key is to use the given \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) and the properties of the rectangle to find \(m\angle 5\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Predicates need to capture:
  - The rectangle \(WXYZ\).
  - The diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) and their intersection at \(A\).
  - The angles formed by the diagonals, especially \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\).
  - The relationship between \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) based on the properties of the rectangle.
