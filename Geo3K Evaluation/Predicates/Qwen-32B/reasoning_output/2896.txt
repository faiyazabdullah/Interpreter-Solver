================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle J M L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure is a quadrilateral labeled as \( J K L M \).
  - It is explicitly mentioned in the problem statement that \( J K L M \) is a parallelogram.
  
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \( J, K, L, M \).
  - Lines: \( J K, K L, L M, M J \).

- **Angles**:
  - One angle is explicitly marked: \( \angle J K L = 109^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - One side length is given: \( L M = 6 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings such as right angles or parallel lines are explicitly indicated beyond the context provided in the problem statement.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \( J K L M \) is a parallelogram:
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \( J K \parallel M L \) and \( J M \parallel K L \).
  - Opposite sides are congruent: \( J K = M L \) and \( J M = K L \).
  - Opposite angles are congruent: \( \angle J K L = \angle M L J \) and \( \angle J M L = \angle K L M \).
  - Consecutive angles are supplementary: \( \angle J K L + \angle K L M = 180^\circ \), \( \angle K L M + \angle M L J = 180^\circ \), etc.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given:
  - \( \angle J K L = 109^\circ \).
  - \( L M = 6 \).
  
- Implications:
  - Since \( J K L M \) is a parallelogram, \( \angle J M L \) is the consecutive angle to \( \angle J K L \). Therefore, \( \angle J M L + \angle J K L = 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \angle J M L \).
- To find \( m \angle J M L \), we use the property that consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.
- We know \( \angle J K L = 109^\circ \), so:
  \[
  m \angle J M L = 180^\circ - 109^\circ = 71^\circ.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the shape, angles, and the given measurement without directly stating the final answer.
