REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The image shows a pentagon \( EFGHIJ \).
- **Points**: The vertices of the pentagon are labeled \( E, F, G, H, J \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the pentagon are connected by lines.
- **Angles**: The interior angles at each vertex are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
  - \( \angle E = x \)
  - \( \angle F = x + 20^\circ \)
  - \( \angle G = x + 5^\circ \)
  - \( \angle H = x - 5^\circ \)
  - \( \angle J = x + 10^\circ \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a pentagon, so it has five sides and five interior angles.
- The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ = (5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
  \]
- The angles at each vertex are expressed in terms of \( x \). These expressions must sum to 540°.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The numerical values are embedded in the expressions for the angles:
  - \( \angle E = x \)
  - \( \angle F = x + 20^\circ \)
  - \( \angle G = x + 5^\circ \)
  - \( \angle H = x - 5^\circ \)
  - \( \angle J = x + 10^\circ \)
- These expressions represent the measures of the interior angles of the pentagon.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \angle H \), which is the measure of the angle at vertex \( H \).
- To find \( m \angle H \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon is 540°.
- Once \( x \) is found, we can substitute it into the expression for \( \angle H = x - 5^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the pentagon, its vertices, sides, and the given angle expressions.
- We also need to express the relationship that the sum of the interior angles equals 540°.
- Predicates will capture the structure of the pentagon, the angle expressions, and the sum constraint without directly solving for \( x \) or \( m \angle H \).
