REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure shows a quadrilateral \(WXYZ\).
  - There are additional points and lines inside the quadrilateral, forming smaller triangles and intersecting diagonals.
  - Key points: \(W, X, Y, Z, A\).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) intersect at point \(A\).
  - Other segments include \(WZ\), \(XY\), \(WA\), \(AX\), \(AY\), \(AZ\), etc.

- **Angles:**
  - Angles are labeled numerically (\(\angle 1, \angle 2, \ldots\)).
  - Right angles are marked at vertices \(W, X, Y, Z\) indicating that \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle.

- **Measurements:**
  - The problem states that \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols at \(W, X, Y, Z\) confirm that \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties:**
  - \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and parallel, and all interior angles are right angles.
  - Diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) are equal in length and bisect each other.

- **Triangle Properties:**
  - The intersection of diagonals forms triangles such as \(\triangle WAX\), \(\triangle ZAY\), etc.
  - The problem involves analyzing the angles formed by the diagonals and sides of the rectangle.

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, the diagonals divide it into four right triangles.
  - The angles around point \(A\) sum to \(360^\circ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement:**
  - \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).

- **Inferred Measurements:**
  - Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, \(\angle W, \angle X, \angle Y, \angle Z\) are all right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
  - The diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) bisect each other, and the triangles formed are congruent by symmetry.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks for the measure of \(\angle 2\).
- To find \(m\angle 2\), we need to use the properties of the rectangle and the relationships between the angles formed by the diagonals.
- Since \(m\angle 1 = 30^\circ\) and the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, the angles around point \(A\) are related by symmetry and the fact that the sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and constraints clearly.
- Predicates will include the definition of the rectangle, the diagonals, the angles, and the relationships between them.
- The final goal is to express the relationships without directly solving for \(m\angle 2\).
