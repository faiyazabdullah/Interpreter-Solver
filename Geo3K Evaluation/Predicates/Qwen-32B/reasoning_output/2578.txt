REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present with center \( E \).
  - Several chords and secants intersect within and outside the circle.
  - Points \( A, B, C, D \) are marked on the circumference or outside the circle.
  - Lines \( DB \) and \( CA \) are secants intersecting inside the circle at point \( G \).
  - Chords \( BC \) and \( CD \) are also present.

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - The segment \( DA \) (part of secant \( DB \)) is labeled as \( x \).
  - The segment \( BA \) (part of secant \( DB \)) is labeled as 24.
  - The segment \( CA \) (part of secant \( CA \)) is labeled as 9.
  - The segment \( CG \) (part of secant \( CA \)) is labeled as 12.25.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings indicating parallelism, perpendicularity, or symmetry are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Secant-Secant Relationship:**
  - The secants \( DB \) and \( CA \) intersect at point \( G \) inside the circle.
  - According to the **Secant-Secant Power Theorem**, for two secants intersecting inside a circle:
    \[
    (DA)(DB) = (CA)(CG)
    \]
  - Here, \( DA = x \), \( DB = DA + BA = x + 24 \), \( CA = 9 \), and \( CG = 12.25 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( DA = x \)
  - \( BA = 24 \)
  - \( CA = 9 \)
  - \( CG = 12.25 \)

- **Relationships:**
  - Using the Secant-Secant Power Theorem:
    \[
    (DA)(DB) = (CA)(CG)
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    x(x + 24) = 9 \times 12.25
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we use the Secant-Secant Power Theorem and solve the resulting quadratic equation:
  \[
  x(x + 24) = 9 \times 12.25
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  x^2 + 24x = 110.25
  \]
  Rearranging:
  \[
  x^2 + 24x - 110.25 = 0
  \]
  Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
  \[
  a = 1, \quad b = 24, \quad c = -110.25
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{-24 \pm \sqrt{24^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-110.25)}}{2 \cdot 1}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{-24 \pm \sqrt{576 + 441}}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{-24 \pm \sqrt{1017}}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = \frac{-24 \pm 31.9}{2}
  \]
  Taking the positive root (since \( x \) represents a length):
  \[
  x = \frac{7.9}{2} = 3.95
  \]
  Rounding to the nearest tenth:
  \[
  x \approx 4.0
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The predicates must represent the geometric relationships and measurements without directly stating the solution.
- Key relationships to capture:
  - The secant-secant power theorem.
  - The lengths of the segments involved.
  - The intersection of the secants inside the circle.
