REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is present with center \( C \).
  - Several points lie on the circumference of the circle: \( L \), \( M \), \( N \), and \( R \).
  - Lines are drawn from the center \( C \) to these points on the circumference, forming radii.

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Radii \( CL \), \( CM \), \( CN \), and \( CR \) are drawn from the center \( C \) to the points on the circumference.
  - Angles are marked at the center:
    - \( \angle NCM = 60^\circ \)
    - \( \angle MCR = (x-1)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle RCL = (3x + 5)^\circ \)

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - The angles are expressed in terms of the variable \( x \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties**:
  - All radii of a circle are equal.
  - The angles subtended by the radii at the center sum up to \( 360^\circ \).

- **Angular Relationships**:
  - The central angles \( \angle NCM \), \( \angle MCR \), and \( \angle RCL \) are adjacent and together form part of the full circle.
  - Since \( \angle NCM = 60^\circ \), the remaining angles \( \angle MCR \) and \( \angle RCL \) must satisfy the equation involving \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( \angle NCM = 60^\circ \)
  - \( \angle MCR = (x-1)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle RCL = (3x + 5)^\circ \)

- **Relationships**:
  - The sum of the central angles around the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Therefore, the equation relating these angles is:
    \[
    \angle NCM + \angle MCR + \angle RCL = 360^\circ
    \]
    Substituting the given expressions:
    \[
    60 + (x-1) + (3x + 5) = 360
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle NCL \).
- To find \( m\angle NCL \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) first by solving the equation derived from the angular relationships.
- Once \( x \) is known, we can calculate \( \angle RCL \) and then use it to find \( \angle NCL \):
  \[
  \angle NCL = \angle NCM + \angle MCR + \angle RCL
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will capture the circle, its center, points on the circumference, radii, and the given angles.
