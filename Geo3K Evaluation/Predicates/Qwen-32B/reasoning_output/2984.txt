REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure shows a quadrilateral \( WXYZ \).
  - Points \( W, X, Y, Z \) are the vertices of the quadrilateral.
  
- **Lines:**
  - Lines connect the vertices \( WX, XY, YZ, ZW \).

- **Angles:**
  - Angles are labeled at each vertex:
    - \( \angle X \) is labeled as \( a^\circ \).
    - \( \angle Y \) is labeled as \( (a - 28)^\circ \).
    - \( \angle Z \) is labeled as \( (a + 2)^\circ \).
    - \( \angle W \) is labeled as \( \left(\frac{1}{2}a + 8\right)^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings (e.g., parallel lines, right angles) are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \( 360^\circ \).
  - Therefore, we can use this property to set up an equation involving the angles at \( W, X, Y, Z \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - The angles are expressed in terms of \( a \):
    - \( \angle X = a^\circ \)
    - \( \angle Y = (a - 28)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle Z = (a + 2)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle W = \left(\frac{1}{2}a + 8\right)^\circ \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral is:
    \[
    \angle X + \angle Y + \angle Z + \angle W = 360^\circ.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the measure of \( \angle Y \), denoted as \( m \angle Y \).
- **Relevant Information:**
  - The measure of \( \angle Y \) is given as \( (a - 28)^\circ \).
  - To find \( m \angle Y \), we need to determine the value of \( a \) using the sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the quadrilateral and its vertices.
  - Define the angles at each vertex in terms of \( a \).
  - Use the property that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \).
