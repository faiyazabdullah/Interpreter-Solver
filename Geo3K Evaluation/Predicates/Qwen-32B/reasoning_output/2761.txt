REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Two triangles are shown: one larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \) and a smaller triangle similar to it.
  - Both triangles have right angles, as indicated by the right-angle symbols.
  - The larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The smaller triangle has vertices corresponding to the larger triangle's sides.

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - In \( \triangle ABC \):
    - \( AB = 8 \)
    - \( BC = 3x \)
  - In the smaller triangle:
    - One side is marked as 6.
    - Another side is marked as \( x \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Congruent marks are shown on corresponding sides of the two triangles, indicating similarity.
  - Right-angle symbols indicate that both triangles are right triangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similarity**:
  - The two triangles are similar because they have corresponding congruent angles (right angles and equal marked angles).
  - Corresponding sides are proportional.

- **Proportional Relationships**:
  - The sides of the smaller triangle are proportional to the sides of the larger triangle.
  - The ratio of corresponding sides will be used to find \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - Larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \):
    - \( AB = 8 \)
    - \( BC = 3x \)
  - Smaller triangle:
    - Corresponding side to \( AB \): 6
    - Corresponding side to \( BC \): \( x \)

- **Relationships**:
  - The ratio of the corresponding sides of the larger triangle to the smaller triangle is constant.
  - This ratio can be expressed as:
    \[
    \frac{\text{Side of larger triangle}}{\text{Corresponding side of smaller triangle}}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the property of similar triangles: the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
- We need to set up a proportion using the given side lengths and solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, their similarity, and the proportional relationships.
- Include all given measurements and the fact that the triangles are similar.
- Ensure all visible geometric constraints and properties are captured in the predicates.
