REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is depicted with center \( A \).
  - Points \( D, F, P, G, L \) are marked on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( D F \) and \( P G \) are diameters of the circle.
  - Point \( A \) is the center of the circle.
  
- **Lines and Diameters:**
  - \( D F \) is a diameter passing through the center \( A \).
  - \( P G \) is another diameter passing through the center \( A \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The length of diameter \( D F \) is given as 10 units.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional special markings like right angles or congruence are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - The center of the circle is \( A \).
  - Both \( D F \) and \( P G \) are diameters, meaning they pass through the center \( A \).
  - All diameters of a circle are equal in length.

- **Diameters and Radii:**
  - Since \( D F \) and \( P G \) are diameters, their lengths are twice the radius of the circle.
  - The radius \( r \) is half the length of any diameter.

- **Symmetry and Center:**
  - The center \( A \) is equidistant from all points on the circumference.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement:**
  - \( D F = 10 \) (diameter of the circle).

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - The radius \( r \) of the circle is half of the diameter:
    \[
    r = \frac{D F}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - Find the length \( D A \), where \( D \) is a point on the circumference and \( A \) is the center of the circle.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Property:**
  - The distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference is the radius of the circle.
  - Therefore, \( D A \) is the radius of the circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Indicate that \( D F \) and \( P G \) are diameters.
  - Relate the diameter to the radius.
  - Establish that \( D A \) is the radius.
