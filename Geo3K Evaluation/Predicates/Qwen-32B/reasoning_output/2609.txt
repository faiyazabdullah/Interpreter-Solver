================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a circle centered at point \( M \).
  - Various points are labeled on the circumference: \( F, G, H, J, K, L, N, P \).
  - Chords are drawn within the circle, connecting pairs of points on the circumference.
  - Right-angle symbols are present at points \( L \) and \( N \), indicating that \( ML \perp FL \) and \( MN \perp JP \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( FL = 24 \).
  - \( HJ = 48 \).
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angles at \( L \) and \( N \) suggest that \( ML \) and \( MN \) are radii perpendicular to the chords \( FL \) and \( JP \), respectively.
  - The arc \( HP \) is explicitly mentioned with a measure of \( 65^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( M \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( ML \perp FL \) and \( MN \perp JP \) imply that \( ML \) and \( MN \) are radii perpendicular to the respective chords, making them the perpendicular bisectors of the chords.
  - \( FL \) and \( JP \) are chords of the circle.
  - \( HJ \) is another chord, and its length is given as 48.
  - The arc \( HP \) has a measure of \( 65^\circ \).

- **Implied Constraints:**
  - Since \( ML \perp FL \), \( L \) is the midpoint of \( FL \). Therefore, \( FL = 2 \times LF' \), where \( F' \) is the intersection of \( ML \) and \( FL \).
  - Similarly, \( N \) is the midpoint of \( JP \), so \( JP = 2 \times JP' \), where \( P' \) is the intersection of \( MN \) and \( JP \).
  - The arc \( HP \) subtends an angle of \( 65^\circ \) at the center \( M \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( FL = 24 \): This is the length of the chord \( FL \).
  - \( HJ = 48 \): This is the length of the chord \( HJ \).
  - \( m\widehat{HP} = 65^\circ \): This is the measure of the arc \( HP \).

- **Interpretation:**
  - The arc \( HP \) subtends a central angle of \( 65^\circ \). This angle is related to the length of the chord \( HJ \) through the circle's radius and trigonometric relationships.
  - The perpendicular bisectors \( ML \) and \( MN \) divide the chords \( FL \) and \( JP \) into equal halves.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - Find \( m\widehat{HJ} \), the measure of the arc \( HJ \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an arc is directly related to the central angle that subtends it.
  - The length of a chord can be related to the central angle and the radius of the circle using trigonometric formulas.
  - The arc \( HJ \) subtends a central angle at \( M \), and we need to determine this angle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify the perpendicular relationships and midpoints.
  - Indicate the lengths of the chords and the measures of the arcs.
  - Use relationships between chords, radii, and central angles.
