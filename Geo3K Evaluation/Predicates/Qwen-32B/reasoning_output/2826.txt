REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Quadrilateral \(WXYZ\) is labeled as a rectangle.
  - The vertices are labeled \(W\), \(X\), \(Y\), and \(Z\).
  - Diagonals \(WX\), \(YZ\), and \(WZ\) are drawn inside the rectangle.
  - Additional lines are present, creating several triangles and angles within the rectangle.

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - The diagonals intersect at point \(A\).
  - Various angles are labeled as \(\angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \ldots, \angle 12\).

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - The angle \(\angle 1\) is explicitly given as \(30^\circ\).
  - Other angles are unlabeled but can be deduced from the properties of the rectangle and intersecting lines.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols are present at corners \(W, X, Y,\) and \(Z\), indicating that \(WXYZ\) is indeed a rectangle.
  - No additional congruence or parallel markings are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rectangle Properties:**
  - Opposite sides of the rectangle are parallel and equal in length.
  - All interior angles are right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
  - Diagonals of the rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other.

- **Intersecting Lines:**
  - The diagonals \(WX\) and \(YZ\) intersect at point \(A\), dividing the rectangle into four smaller triangles.
  - The diagonal \(WZ\) intersects the sides \(XY\) and \(YZ\) at points, forming additional angles.

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, the diagonals bisect each other.
  - The angles formed by the intersection of diagonals are related by symmetry and the properties of the rectangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement:**
  - \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Since \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, all interior angles are \(90^\circ\).
  - The diagonals bisect each other, so the triangles formed by the diagonals are symmetric.
  - The angles around point \(A\) sum up to \(360^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:** Find the measure of \(\angle 3\).
- **Relevant Information:**
  - \(\angle 1 = 30^\circ\).
  - The properties of the rectangle and the symmetry of the diagonals will help determine \(\angle 3\).
- **Approach:**
  - Use the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and create congruent triangles.
  - Analyze the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals and the sides of the rectangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle and its properties.
- Include the given angle \(\angle 1\) and its relationships with other angles.
- Use symmetry and the properties of the diagonals to deduce the measure of \(\angle 3\).
