### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( C \).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Line \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - Line \( BC \) is one leg of the triangle.
  - Line \( AC \) is the other leg of the triangle.
  - The angle at \( B \) is labeled as \( 61^\circ \).
  - The angle at \( C \) is a right angle (marked with a square).

- **Measurements:**
  - The length of \( AC \) is given as 24 units.
  - The length of \( AB \) is denoted as \( x \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).
  - The sides \( AC \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
  - \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The angle at \( B \) is \( 61^\circ \), and the angle at \( C \) is \( 90^\circ \).
  - The third angle at \( A \) can be determined using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AC = 24 \) units.
  - The angle \( \angle ABC = 61^\circ \).
  - The angle \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

- **Derived Information:**
  - Using trigonometry, we can relate the sides and angles of the triangle.
  - Specifically, we can use the cosine function to find the hypotenuse \( AB \):
    \[
    \cos(61^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{AC}{AB}
    \]
    \[
    \cos(61^\circ) = \frac{24}{x}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of the hypotenuse \( AB \), denoted as \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we need to use the trigonometric relationship involving the cosine of the angle \( 61^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the triangle, its angles, sides, and the trigonometric relationship without directly solving for \( x \).
