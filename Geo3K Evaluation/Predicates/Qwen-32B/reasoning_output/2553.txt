REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains several labeled points: \( N, M, J, K, L, O, H, G, F \).
- **Lines**: There are multiple intersecting lines forming transversals across two sets of parallel lines:
  - Lines \( NM \) and \( OH \) appear to be parallel.
  - Lines \( JG \) and \( LF \) appear to be parallel.
- **Angles**: Various angles are labeled from 1 to 14. Specifically:
  - \( \angle 11 = 62^\circ \)
  - \( \angle 14 = 38^\circ \)
- **Markings**: The diagram includes markings indicating parallelism between certain lines.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**: Based on the markings, we can infer:
  - Line \( NM \) is parallel to line \( OH \).
  - Line \( JG \) is parallel to line \( LF \).
- **Transversals**: Line \( MK \) acts as a transversal cutting through the parallel lines \( NM \) and \( OH \), creating corresponding, alternate interior, and supplementary angles.
- **Angle Relationships**: Since \( NM \parallel OH \), the angles formed by the transversal \( MK \) will have specific relationships:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle 11 = 62^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 14 = 38^\circ \)
- **Implications**:
  - Since \( NM \parallel OH \), and \( MK \) is a transversal, we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals to find other angles.
  - Specifically, \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 1 \) are corresponding angles, so they are equal.
  - Similarly, \( \angle 14 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are consecutive interior angles, so they are supplementary.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 1 \).
- From the analysis, \( \angle 1 \) corresponds to \( \angle 11 \) because they are corresponding angles formed by the transversal \( MK \) and the parallel lines \( NM \) and \( OH \).
- Therefore, \( m\angle 1 = m\angle 11 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements accurately.
- Predicates should capture the parallelism, transversal properties, and angle relationships without directly stating the final answer.
