REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure contains multiple triangles:
    - Triangle \( \triangle PQR \)
    - Triangle \( \triangle PQS \)
    - Triangle \( \triangle QRS \)
  - Key points are labeled: \( P, Q, R, S \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments are drawn connecting the points:
    - \( PQ \)
    - \( QR \)
    - \( PR \)
    - \( QS \)
    - \( PS \)

- **Angles**:
  - Angles are labeled:
    - \( \angle PQR = 90^\circ \) (indicated by a right angle symbol).
    - \( \angle QPR = 51^\circ \).
    - \( \angle QRS = 33^\circ \).
    - \( \angle 1 \) is formed at point \( S \) by the intersection of lines \( QS \) and \( PS \).

- **Other Markings**:
  - No additional markings for parallelism, congruence, etc., are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Right Triangle**:
  - \( \triangle PQR \) is a right triangle because \( \angle PQR = 90^\circ \).

- **Triangle \( \triangle PQS \)**:
  - \( QS \) is a segment inside \( \triangle PQR \), creating two smaller triangles:
    - \( \triangle PQS \)
    - \( \triangle QRS \).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - Since \( \triangle PQR \) is a right triangle, the sum of the acute angles \( \angle QPR \) and \( \angle QRP \) must be \( 90^\circ \):
    \[
    \angle QRP = 90^\circ - \angle QPR = 90^\circ - 51^\circ = 39^\circ.
    \]
  - In \( \triangle QRS \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore:
    \[
    \angle QSR = 180^\circ - \angle QRS - \angle QRP = 180^\circ - 33^\circ - 39^\circ = 108^\circ.
    \]

- **Intersection at Point \( S \)**:
  - Point \( S \) is the intersection of \( QS \) and \( PS \), forming \( \angle 1 \) at \( S \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle PQR = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle QPR = 51^\circ \)
  - \( \angle QRS = 33^\circ \)

- **Derived Angles**:
  - \( \angle QRP = 39^\circ \) (from the right triangle property).
  - \( \angle QSR = 108^\circ \) (from the angle sum property of \( \triangle QRS \)).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 1 \), which is formed at point \( S \) by the intersection of lines \( QS \) and \( PS \).
- To find \( \angle 1 \), we need to use the angle sum property around point \( S \) and the fact that \( \angle QSR = 108^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- The key relationships involve the right triangle \( \triangle PQR \), the angles in \( \triangle QRS \), and the intersection at point \( S \).
