REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains a square \(ABCD\) and a smaller parallelogram inside it.
  - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\) form the vertices of the larger square.
  - Points \(Q\), \(Q'\), \(X\) are additional points within the diagram.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DA\) form the sides of the square.
  - Line segments \(QQ'\) and \(QC\) are shown, with specific lengths indicated.
  
- **Measurements:**
  - The segment \(QC\) is labeled as 5 units.
  - The segment \(QQ'\) is labeled as \(x\).
  - The total length from \(Q'\) to \(C\) through \(Q\) is 15 units.
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - The square \(ABCD\) is marked with equal side lengths.
  - The parallelogram inside the square is highlighted in blue, indicating a focus on its scaling or similarity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Square Properties:**
  - \(ABCD\) is a square, so all sides are equal, and all angles are right angles.
  
- **Parallelogram Properties:**
  - The smaller parallelogram is similar to the larger square because it shares proportional dimensions.
  
- **Scaling Relationship:**
  - The parallelogram is a scaled-down version of the square, centered around point \(X\).
  - The points \(Q\) and \(Q'\) lie along a horizontal line, suggesting a scaling transformation.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(QC = 5\) units.
  - \(QQ' = x\) units.
  - Total length \(Q'C = 15\) units.
  
- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \(Q'C = QC + QQ'\), we have:
    \[
    Q'C = QC + QQ' \implies 15 = 5 + x \implies x = 10.
    \]
  - This indicates that the scaling factor is related to the ratio of the distances from \(Q\) to \(Q'\) and from \(Q\) to \(C\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **scale factor from \(Q\) to \(Q'\)**.
- To find the scale factor, we need to determine the ratio of the distances involved in the scaling transformation.
- From the measurements, \(QC = 5\) and \(QQ' = 10\), so the scale factor is:
  \[
  \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{QQ'}{QC} = \frac{10}{5} = 2.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- The key relationships involve the square, the parallelogram, and the scaling transformation.
- The scale factor is derived from the ratio of the distances \(QQ'\) and \(QC\).
