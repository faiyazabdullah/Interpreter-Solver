================================================================================

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Shapes Identified**:
  - \( J K L M \) is a rectangle.
  - \( M L P R \) is a rhombus.
  
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \( J, K, L, M, P, R \).
  - Lines: \( J K, K L, L M, M J, M L, L P, P R, R M \).

- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle J M K \cong \angle R M P \).
  - \( m \angle J M K = 55^\circ \).
  - \( m \angle M R P = 70^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The rectangle \( J K L M \) has right angles at all vertices.
  - The rhombus \( M L P R \) has equal sides and opposite angles equal.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rectangle Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \( J K \parallel M L \) and \( J M \parallel K L \).
  - All interior angles are right angles: \( \angle J M K = 90^\circ \), \( \angle K L M = 90^\circ \), etc.

- **Rhombus Properties**:
  - All sides are equal: \( M L = L P = P R = R M \).
  - Opposite angles are equal: \( \angle M L P = \angle R P M \) and \( \angle L M R = \angle P R L \).

- **Given Congruent Angles**:
  - \( \angle J M K \cong \angle R M P \) implies \( m \angle J M K = m \angle R M P = 55^\circ \).

- **Other Relationships**:
  - Since \( M L P R \) is a rhombus, \( \angle M R P = 70^\circ \) implies \( \angle R M L = 70^\circ \) (opposite angles in a rhombus are equal).
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles they form.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Known Measurements**:
  - \( m \angle J M K = 55^\circ \).
  - \( m \angle R M P = 55^\circ \) (by congruence).
  - \( m \angle M R P = 70^\circ \).

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - In the rectangle \( J K L M \), \( \angle J M K = 90^\circ \). However, the angle \( \angle J M K \) in the context of the rhombus is given as \( 55^\circ \), so we need to consider the internal geometry of the rhombus.
  - Since \( M L P R \) is a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. Thus, \( \angle K M L \) is part of the geometry involving the intersection of diagonals.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \angle K M L \).
- To find \( m \angle K M L \), we need to use the properties of the rectangle and rhombus, along with the given angle measurements.
- Key relationships to use:
  1. The sum of angles around point \( M \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  2. The diagonals of the rhombus bisect the angles at the vertices.
  3. The rectangle's right angles provide additional constraints.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric shapes, relationships, and measurements.
- Predicates should capture the structure of the rectangle and rhombus, the congruence of angles, and the angle measurements.
