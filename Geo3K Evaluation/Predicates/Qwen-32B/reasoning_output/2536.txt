REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Three circles are present, centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The circles are tangent to a straight line \( ED \).
  - Points \( E \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( D \) lie on the line \( ED \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - Diameter of \( \odot A \): 10 units.
  - Diameter of \( \odot B \): 30 units.
  - Diameter of \( \odot C \): 10 units.
  - Segments \( AZ \) and \( CW \) are marked as congruent.
  - Given: \( CW = 2 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( AZ \cong CW \) indicates congruence of segments.
  - The circles are tangent to the line \( ED \), implying specific geometric constraints.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements**:
  - The circles \( \odot A \), \( \odot B \), and \( \odot C \) are tangent to the line \( ED \).
  - The diameters of the circles determine their radii:
    - Radius of \( \odot A \): \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \).
    - Radius of \( \odot B \): \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \).
    - Radius of \( \odot C \): \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \).
  - The segments \( AZ \) and \( CW \) are congruent, and both have a length of 2 units.
  - The line \( ED \) acts as a common tangent to all three circles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - Diameter of \( \odot A \): 10.
  - Diameter of \( \odot B \): 30.
  - Diameter of \( \odot C \): 10.
  - \( CW = 2 \).
  - \( AZ = CW = 2 \) (since \( AZ \cong CW \)).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The radii of the circles determine the distances from the centers \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) to the line \( ED \).
  - The segment \( ZX \) lies on the line \( ED \) and is part of the overall configuration involving the tangency and congruence conditions.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - Find the length of \( ZX \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The tangency of circles to the line \( ED \) ensures that the distances from the centers to the line are equal to the radii.
  - The congruence \( AZ \cong CW \) implies \( AZ = CW = 2 \).
  - The total length of segments along the line \( ED \) must be analyzed to determine \( ZX \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the circles, their centers, and radii.
  - Capture the tangency condition of the circles to the line \( ED \).
  - Represent the congruence \( AZ \cong CW \) and the given length \( CW = 2 \).
  - Relate the positions of points \( Z \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( W \) on the line \( ED \).
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are captured without deriving the final answer.
