QUESTION: Find the area of the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure is a rectangle.
  - The rectangle has vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  
- **Points**: 
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are the vertices of the rectangle.
  
- **Lines**: 
  - Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), and \( DA \) form the sides of the rectangle.
  
- **Angles**: 
  - Right angle symbols are present at each vertex (\( \angle A \), \( \angle B \), \( \angle C \), \( \angle D \)).
  
- **Measurements**: 
  - The length of side \( AB \) is 12 ft.
  - The length of side \( AD \) is 10 ft.
  
- **Special Markings**: 
  - All four angles are marked as right angles, indicating the figure is a rectangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**: 
  - Opposite sides of the rectangle are parallel: \( AB \parallel CD \) and \( AD \parallel BC \).
  - Adjacent sides are perpendicular: \( AB \perp AD \), \( AB \perp BC \), \( BC \perp CD \), and \( AD \perp CD \).
  - All interior angles are right angles.
  
- **Constraints and Properties**: 
  - The figure satisfies the definition of a rectangle: a quadrilateral with four right angles and opposite sides equal.
  - The lengths of opposite sides are equal: \( AB = CD = 12 \) ft and \( AD = BC = 10 \) ft.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**: 
  - \( AB = 12 \) ft
  - \( AD = 10 \) ft
  
- **Measurement Interpretation**: 
  - \( AB \) and \( CD \) are the lengths of the longer sides (width).
  - \( AD \) and \( BC \) are the lengths of the shorter sides (height).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked**: 
  - The question asks for the area of the rectangle.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**: 
  - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
    \[
    \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
    \]
  - Here, the length is \( AB = 12 \) ft and the width is \( AD = 10 \) ft.
  
- **Information Needed**: 
  - The lengths of the sides of the rectangle are already provided.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**: 
  - Define the rectangle and its properties.
  - Specify the measurements of the sides.
  - Indicate the right angles and parallel sides.
  
- **Predicates to Avoid**: 
  - Avoid directly stating the final answer or performing calculations.
  - Focus on representing the given information and geometric relationships.
