### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains several labeled points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Q.
- **Lines**: Multiple horizontal and vertical lines are present, connecting the points.
- **Shapes**: The figure appears to consist of parallelograms and rectangles formed by the intersecting lines.
- **Measurements**:
  - Horizontal segments:
    - Segment \( EF \): Length \( 6 - x \)
    - Segment \( HI \): Length \( 2x + 3 \)
    - Segment \( IL \): Length \( \frac{4}{3}y + 1 \)
    - Segment \( JC \): Length \( 2y \)
  - Vertical segments:
    - Segment \( AM \): Length \( 6 - x \)
    - Segment \( EN \): Length \( 2y \)
- **Special Markings**:
  - Parallel lines are indicated by small arrowheads on the horizontal and vertical lines, suggesting that opposite sides of the shapes are parallel.
  - All horizontal and vertical lines appear to be straight and evenly spaced.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - Horizontal lines \( EF \parallel HI \parallel IL \parallel JC \).
  - Vertical lines \( AM \parallel EN \).
- **Parallelograms and Rectangles**:
  - The shapes formed by the intersecting lines suggest parallelograms and possibly rectangles.
  - For example, \( EFHI \), \( HIIL \), \( ILJC \), and \( AMEN \) appear to be parallelograms or rectangles.
- **Congruence**:
  - Opposite sides of the parallelograms are congruent.
  - For example, \( EF = HI \), \( HI = IL \), etc.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Horizontal Measurements**:
  - \( EF = 6 - x \)
  - \( HI = 2x + 3 \)
  - \( IL = \frac{4}{3}y + 1 \)
  - \( JC = 2y \)
- **Vertical Measurements**:
  - \( AM = 6 - x \)
  - \( EN = 2y \)
- These measurements are related through the properties of parallelograms and rectangles, where opposite sides are equal.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we need to use the relationships between the horizontal and vertical measurements, particularly the fact that opposite sides of parallelograms are equal.
- From the diagram, we observe that:
  - \( EF = HI \)
  - \( HI = IL \)
  - \( IL = JC \)
  - These equalities will help us set up equations involving \( x \) and \( y \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and measurements in the form of predicates.
- Key predicates will include:
  - Defining the shapes (parallelograms and rectangles).
  - Indicating parallel lines.
  - Stating the lengths of the segments.
  - Using the property that opposite sides of parallelograms are equal.
