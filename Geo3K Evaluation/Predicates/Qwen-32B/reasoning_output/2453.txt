REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The image depicts a rhombus labeled \( FGHJ \) with its diagonals intersecting at point \( K \).
- **Points**: The vertices of the rhombus are labeled \( F, G, H, J \). The intersection of the diagonals is labeled \( K \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the rhombus are \( FG, GH, HJ, JF \). The diagonals are \( FH \) and \( GJ \).
- **Special Markings**:
  - The diagonals intersect at right angles, indicated by the right angle symbol at \( K \).
  - The lengths of two sides are given: \( GH = x + 9 \) and \( JH = 5x - 2 \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rhombus Properties**:
  - All sides of a rhombus are equal in length.
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
- **Constraints**:
  - Since \( FGHJ \) is a rhombus, \( FG = GH = HJ = JF \).
  - The diagonals \( FH \) and \( GJ \) intersect at \( K \) such that \( FK = KH \) and \( GK = KJ \).
  - The diagonals are perpendicular: \( Perpendicular(FH, GJ) \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( GH = x + 9 \)
  - \( JH = 5x - 2 \)
- **Implications**:
  - Since \( FGHJ \) is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, \( GH = JH \).
  - This gives us the equation \( x + 9 = 5x - 2 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the property that all sides of a rhombus are equal, leading to the equation \( x + 9 = 5x - 2 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- Predicates will include the definition of the rhombus, the properties of its diagonals, and the given side lengths.
