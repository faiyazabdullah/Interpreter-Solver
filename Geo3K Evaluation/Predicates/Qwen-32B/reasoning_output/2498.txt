### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains a triangle \( \triangle ABD \) and an extension of one of its sides.
  - Points labeled: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  
- **Lines**:
  - \( AB \), \( BD \), \( AD \), and \( BC \) form the sides of the triangle and the extended line.
  
- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle BAD = 52^\circ \) (labeled).
  - \( \angle ABC = 27^\circ \) (labeled).
  - \( \angle 1 \) is the angle formed between \( AD \) and \( DC \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The angles \( 52^\circ \) and \( 27^\circ \) are explicitly labeled.
  - No lengths are provided, so we focus solely on angle relationships.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABD \) is a triangle with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \).
  - \( BD \) is part of the larger triangle, and \( DC \) extends from \( D \) along the same line as \( BC \).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - \( \angle BAD \) and \( \angle ABC \) are interior angles of the larger triangle formed by extending \( BD \) to \( C \).
  - \( \angle 1 \) is an exterior angle to \( \triangle ABD \) at vertex \( D \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle BAD = 52^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 27^\circ \).
  
- **Objective**:
  - We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \), which is an exterior angle to \( \triangle ABD \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 1 \).
- To solve this, we use the property that an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of the triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, its angles, and the relationship between the exterior angle and the interior angles.
- The key predicate will involve the relationship \( \angle 1 = \angle BAD + \angle ABC \).
