================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - Two triangles are shown: \( \triangle XYZ \) and \( \triangle JKL \).
  - Both triangles have one common angle marked with a pink arc, indicating that the angles at \( X \) and \( J \) are congruent.
  - Both triangles have one side marked as 51° at vertices \( Y \) and \( K \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - In \( \triangle XYZ \):
    - \( XY = 5 \)
    - \( YZ = 15 \)
    - \( XZ \) is not explicitly given.
    - \( \angle XYZ = 51^\circ \)
    - \( \angle XZY \) is marked with a pink arc.
  - In \( \triangle JKL \):
    - \( JK = 4 \)
    - \( KL \) is not explicitly given.
    - \( \angle KJL = 51^\circ \)
    - \( \angle JLK \) is marked with a pink arc, indicating it is congruent to \( \angle XZY \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The pink arcs indicate that \( \angle XZY \) and \( \angle JLK \) are congruent.
  - The 51° angles at \( Y \) and \( K \) suggest that these are corresponding angles in the two triangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruent Angles:**
  - \( \angle XYZ = \angle KJL = 51^\circ \)
  - \( \angle XZY = \angle JLK \) (marked with the same pink arc).
  - By the AA similarity criterion, \( \triangle XYZ \sim \triangle JKL \).

- **Proportional Sides:**
  - Since the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional:
    \[
    \frac{XY}{JK} = \frac{YZ}{KL} = \frac{XZ}{JL}
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( XY = 5 \)
  - \( YZ = 15 \)
  - \( JK = 4 \)
  - \( KL \) is the unknown we need to find.
  - The proportionality of sides will help us determine \( KL \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( KL \).
- To find \( KL \), we use the similarity ratio between the corresponding sides of the triangles:
  \[
  \frac{YZ}{KL} = \frac{XY}{JK}
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \frac{15}{KL} = \frac{5}{4}
  \]
  Solving for \( KL \):
  \[
  KL = \frac{15 \times 4}{5} = 12
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships, measurements, and similarity between the triangles.
- Predicates should capture the similarity, congruence of angles, and proportional sides without directly stating the final answer.
