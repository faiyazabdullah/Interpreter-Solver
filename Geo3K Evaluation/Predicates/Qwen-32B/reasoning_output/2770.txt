QUESTION: Find m \angle A.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with four vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - The sides are represented as straight lines connecting these points.
  
- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - Angles are labeled with variables:
    - \(\angle A = x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle B = 2x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle C = 2x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle D = x^\circ\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No special markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties**:
  - The figure is a quadrilateral, so it has four sides and four angles.
  - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - The angles are expressed in terms of \(x\):
    - \(\angle A = x\)
    - \(\angle B = 2x\)
    - \(\angle C = 2x\)
    - \(\angle D = x\).
  - These relationships imply symmetry in the quadrilateral, particularly in the angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The angles are given in terms of \(x\):
    - \(\angle A = x\)
    - \(\angle B = 2x\)
    - \(\angle C = 2x\)
    - \(\angle D = x\).
  - Using the property that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\), we can set up an equation:
    \[
    x + 2x + 2x + x = 360^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle A\), denoted as \(m \angle A\).
- To find \(m \angle A\), we need to determine the value of \(x\) using the angle sum property of the quadrilateral.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, its angles, and the relationship between the angles.
- The key predicate will involve the sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral.
- We will use the given angle measures in terms of \(x\) to form the necessary equations.
