REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Point \( B \) lies on the x-axis, point \( C \) lies on the y-axis, and point \( A \) lies in the first quadrant.
  
- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Line \( BC \) is vertical (along the y-axis).
  - Line \( BA \) is horizontal (along the x-axis).
  - Line \( CA \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The angle \( \angle CBA = 90^\circ \) (right angle).
  - The angle \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The length of the hypotenuse \( CA = 20 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings for parallel, perpendicular, or congruent segments are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle CBA = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \) implies that \( \angle BCA = 30^\circ \) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \)).
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle, which has specific side-length ratios:
    - Opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle: \( x/2 \) (half the hypotenuse).
    - Opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle: \( x\sqrt{3}/2 \).
    - Hypotenuse: \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The hypotenuse \( CA = 20 \).
  - Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:
    - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( BC \)) is \( 20/2 = 10 \).
    - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)) is \( 10\sqrt{3} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the horizontal distance \( AB \).
- From the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle, we know:
  - \( AB = 10\sqrt{3} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships, measurements, and constraints in the figure.
- Predicates will include the triangle, angles, sides, and the specific properties of the 30-60-90 triangle.
