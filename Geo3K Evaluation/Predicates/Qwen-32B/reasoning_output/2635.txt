================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is shown with center \( Q \).
  - Points \( A, D, E, F \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( XD \) and \( XE \) are tangents to the circle at points \( D \) and \( E \), respectively.
  - \( AD \) and \( AE \) are radii of the circle.
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle ADX \) and \( \angle AEX \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( EX = 24 \)
  - \( DE = 7 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols at \( \angle ADX \) and \( \angle AEX \), indicating tangents from a common external point to a circle are perpendicular to the radii at the points of tangency.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( XD \) and \( XE \) are tangents from point \( X \) to the circle.
  - \( AD \) and \( AE \) are radii of the circle.
  - By the tangent-tangent theorem, the lengths of the two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal. Therefore, \( XD = XE \).
  - Since \( EX = 24 \), it follows that \( XD = 24 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( EX = 24 \)
  - \( DE = 7 \)
  - From the tangent-tangent theorem, \( XD = XE = 24 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - Find the length \( TX \).
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The tangent-tangent theorem states that the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal. Thus, \( XD = XE \).
  - Since \( D \) and \( E \) are points of tangency, \( \angle ADX \) and \( \angle AEX \) are right angles.
  - The total length \( TX \) can be determined once all segment lengths are established.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, its center, and points on the circumference.
  - Represent the tangents and their properties.
  - Capture the equality of tangent segments from a common external point.
  - Include the given measurements and relationships.
