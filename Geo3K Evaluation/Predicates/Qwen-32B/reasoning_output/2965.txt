STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2965
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \) with vertices labeled \( X \), \( Y \), and \( W \).
  
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \( X \), \( Y \), \( W \).
  - Lines: \( XY \), \( YW \), \( WX \).

- **Measurements**:
  - Side \( XY \): \( 4x + 5 \).
  - Side \( YW \): \( 6x + 3 \).
  - Side \( WX \): \( 9x \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The sides \( XY \), \( YW \), and \( WX \) have tick marks indicating they are equal in length. This suggests that the triangle is equilateral.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Equilateral Triangle**:
  - Since all three sides of the triangle have tick marks indicating equality, \( \triangle XYZ \) is an equilateral triangle.
  - In an equilateral triangle, all sides are congruent, and all angles are \( 60^\circ \).

- **Constraints**:
  - The lengths of the sides are given in terms of \( x \). These lengths must be equal because the triangle is equilateral.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Side \( XY \): \( 4x + 5 \).
  - Side \( YW \): \( 6x + 3 \).
  - Side \( WX \): \( 9x \).

- **Relationships**:
  - Since the triangle is equilateral, the lengths of the sides must satisfy the equation:
    \[
    4x + 5 = 6x + 3 = 9x
    \]
  - This implies that all three expressions must be equal.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the fact that all sides of the equilateral triangle are equal. This gives us two equations:
  1. \( 4x + 5 = 6x + 3 \)
  2. \( 6x + 3 = 9x \)
  3. \( 4x + 5 = 9x \)

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and constraints in the form of predicates.
- The key relationships are:
  - The triangle is equilateral.
  - The lengths of the sides are equal.
  - The sides are given in terms of \( x \).
