REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two triangles are present: \( \triangle DEF \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points labeled: \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments: \( DE, EF, FD, AB, BC, CA, AC, CB \).

- **Angles:**
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle CBA \) and \( \angle EFD \).
  - Congruent angles are marked between \( \angle EDF \) and \( \angle CAB \), and between \( \angle DEF \) and \( \angle CBA \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( CB = 15 \).
  - \( AC = 45 \).
  - The side \( x \) in \( \triangle DEF \) is the unknown we need to find.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Triangles:**
  - \( \triangle DEF \) and \( \triangle ABC \) appear to be similar due to the congruent angles marked.
  - Both triangles have right angles, so they are right triangles.

- **Similarity:**
  - The congruent angles indicate that \( \triangle DEF \sim \triangle ABC \) by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.
  - Corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.

- **Proportional Sides:**
  - Since \( \triangle DEF \sim \triangle ABC \), the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. Specifically:
    \[
    \frac{DE}{AB} = \frac{EF}{BC} = \frac{FD}{CA}
    \]

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( CB = 15 \).
  - \( AC = 45 \).

- **Unknown Measurement:**
  - The length \( DE = x \) needs to be determined.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the length \( DE \), which is labeled as \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we use the similarity of triangles \( \triangle DEF \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
- The key relationship is the proportionality of corresponding sides.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and constraints clearly.
- Predicates will include the shapes, angles, measurements, and similarity relationships.
- The final goal is to set up the proportionality equation without directly solving it.
