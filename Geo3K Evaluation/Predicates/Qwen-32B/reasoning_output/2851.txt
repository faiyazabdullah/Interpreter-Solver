REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a triangle with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The triangle is denoted as \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Lines:**
  - The sides of the triangle are represented by lines connecting the vertices:
    - \( AB \): The line segment from \( A \) to \( B \).
    - \( BC \): The line segment from \( B \) to \( C \).
    - \( CA \): The line segment from \( C \) to \( A \).

- **Angles:**
  - The angle at vertex \( A \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).
  - The angle at vertex \( C \) is labeled as \( 52^\circ \).
  - The angle at vertex \( B \) is labeled as \( 35^\circ \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The interior angles of the triangle are explicitly labeled.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Properties:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \).
  - The angles at vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) form the three interior angles of \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - The angles \( x \), \( 52^\circ \), and \( 35^\circ \) are related through the triangle angle sum property.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles:**
  - \( \angle C = 52^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = 35^\circ \)
  - \( \angle A = x \) (to be determined).

- **Relevant Property:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
    \[
    \angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks us to find the measure of \( x \), the angle at vertex \( A \).

- **Relevant Information:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The given angles are \( 52^\circ \) and \( 35^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and its vertices.
  - Define the angles and their measures.
  - Capture the relationship that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
