REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure appears to be a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( J, K, L, M \).
  - There are four sides: \( JK, KL, LM, MJ \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( JK \) and \( ML \) are marked as parallel (implied by the arrows).
  - \( JM \) and \( KL \) are also marked as parallel (implied by the arrows).
  - The lengths of \( KL \) and \( MJ \) are both given as 6 units.
  - The length of \( JM \) is not explicitly given but is part of the quadrilateral.
  - The angle \( \angle M \) is explicitly marked as \( 80^\circ \).

- **Angles:**
  - The angle at vertex \( M \) is given as \( 80^\circ \).
  - No other specific angles are marked, but we can infer properties from the parallel sides.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines:**
  - \( JK \parallel ML \) and \( JM \parallel KL \).
  - This implies the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

- **Properties of Parallelograms:**
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( JK = ML \) and \( JM = KL \).
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

- **Given Information:**
  - \( KL = 6 \) and \( MJ = 6 \).
  - \( \angle M = 80^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( KL = 6 \).
  - \( MJ = 6 \).
  - \( \angle M = 80^\circ \).

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( JK \parallel ML \) and \( JM \parallel KL \), the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
  - In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle K \), the measure of angle \( K \).
- To find \( m\angle K \), we use the property that adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary.
- Since \( \angle M = 80^\circ \), the adjacent angle \( \angle K \) must satisfy:
  \[
  m\angle K + m\angle M = 180^\circ
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  m\angle K = 180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, angles, and the given measurements.
- The predicates should capture the properties of the parallelogram and the relationships between the angles.
