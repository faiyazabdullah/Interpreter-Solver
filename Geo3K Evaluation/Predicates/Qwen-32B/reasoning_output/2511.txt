================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a triangle with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The triangle appears to be isosceles, as two sides are marked as \( x \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - Line \( AB \) is labeled with a length of 20 units.
  - Lines \( AC \) and \( BC \) are both labeled as \( x \).

- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( C \), indicating that \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The red dot at each vertex suggests these are specific points of interest.
  - The pink right-angle marker at \( C \) confirms \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Properties**:
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle because \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
  - Since \( AC = BC = x \), the triangle is also isosceles.

- **Constraints**:
  - The hypotenuse \( AB \) is given as 20 units.
  - The legs \( AC \) and \( BC \) are equal in length, both denoted as \( x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AB = 20 \) units (hypotenuse).
  - \( AC = x \) units (one leg).
  - \( BC = x \) units (the other leg).

- **Relationships**:
  - In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies: \( AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \).
  - Substituting the known values: \( 20^2 = x^2 + x^2 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), the length of the legs \( AC \) and \( BC \).
- To find \( x \), we use the Pythagorean theorem and solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and measurements explicitly.
- Predicates will include the triangle, its sides, the right angle, and the equality of the legs.
