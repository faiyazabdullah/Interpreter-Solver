REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains multiple points labeled \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \).
  - Lines connect these points, forming several segments: \( AC, AB, BE, CD, \) and others.
  - Triangles are formed, such as \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle BDE \).

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations**:
  - \( AC = x - 3 \)
  - \( BE = 20 \)
  - \( AB = 16 \)
  - \( CD = x + 5 \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols are present at \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle DBE \), indicating that both are right triangles.
  - No other special markings (e.g., parallel lines, congruent sides) are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
  - \( \triangle BDE \) is also a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
  - The points \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \) form a larger geometric configuration, but no specific quadrilateral or other shapes are explicitly indicated beyond the triangles.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The lengths \( AC, AB, \) and \( BE \) are given in terms of \( x \) and constants.
  - The goal is to find \( CD \), which is expressed as \( x + 5 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( AC = x - 3 \)
  - \( BE = 20 \)
  - \( AB = 16 \)
  - \( CD = x + 5 \)

- **Measurement Interpretation**:
  - \( AC \) and \( CD \) are segments involving the variable \( x \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BE \) are fixed lengths.
  - The right-angle symbols indicate that Pythagorean relationships may be applicable.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The question asks for the value of \( CD \), which is given as \( x + 5 \).
  - To find \( CD \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) using the given relationships and measurements.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies: \( AC^2 + AB^2 = BC^2 \).
  - Similarly, \( \triangle BDE \) is a right triangle, so \( BD^2 + BE^2 = DE^2 \).

- **Information Needed**:
  - The value of \( x \) can be determined by analyzing the relationships between the given lengths and applying the Pythagorean theorem to one or both right triangles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the points, lines, and triangles.
  - Specify the right angles and the Pythagorean relationships.
  - Include the given measurements and their relationships.

- **Completeness Check**:
  - All visible geometric elements and relationships are captured.
  - Predicates are atomic and do not include derived solutions or the final answer.
