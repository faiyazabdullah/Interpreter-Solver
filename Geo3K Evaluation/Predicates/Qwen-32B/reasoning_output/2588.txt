REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows two intersecting lines: one passing through points \( F \) and \( B \), and the other passing through points \( A \) and \( D \). These lines intersect at point \( H \).
  - Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \ldots, \angle 8 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols are present at \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \). This indicates that \( \angle 3 = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle 6 = 90^\circ \).

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( m\angle 3 = x - 12 \)
  - \( m\angle 6 = 72^\circ \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines:**
  - The vertical lines through points \( A \) and \( E \) appear to be parallel to each other.
  - Similarly, the horizontal lines through points \( F \) and \( D \) appear to be parallel to each other.

- **Perpendicular Lines:**
  - The lines intersecting at \( H \) form right angles at \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \).

- **Angles:**
  - Since \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are both right angles, they are congruent.
  - The angles formed by the intersection of the lines at \( H \) are related by the properties of linear pairs and vertical angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Information:**
  - \( m\angle 3 = x - 12 \)
  - \( m\angle 6 = 72^\circ \)

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( \angle 3 \) is a right angle, its measure is \( 90^\circ \). Therefore, we have:
    \[
    x - 12 = 90
    \]
  - Solving for \( x \):
    \[
    x = 102
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \) given the relationships \( m\angle 3 = x - 12 \) and \( m\angle 6 = 72^\circ \).
- From the image, we know \( \angle 3 \) is a right angle, so its measure is \( 90^\circ \). This allows us to set up the equation \( x - 12 = 90 \) and solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The key relationships are:
  - \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 6 \) are right angles.
  - The measure of \( \angle 3 \) is given as \( x - 12 \).
  - The measure of \( \angle 6 \) is given as \( 72^\circ \).
