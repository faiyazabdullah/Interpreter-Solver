QUESTION: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram includes a circle and several line segments.
  - Key points: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \).
  - The circle is centered at point \( E \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AE \) and \( BE \) are tangent segments from points \( A \) and \( B \) to the circle.
  - \( CD \) is a chord of the circle, and \( CE \) and \( DE \) are radii.
  - \( EF \) is a segment connecting the center \( E \) to a point \( F \) on the circle.

- **Measurements**:
  - \( AE = 8 \) and \( BE = 8 \) (tangent segments).
  - \( CF = 6 \) (part of the chord \( CD \)).
  - \( CD \) is a straight line segment passing through the circle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Tangent segments \( AE \) and \( BE \) are marked as equal in length, indicating they are tangent from the same external point to the circle.
  - The circle is centered at \( E \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( AE \) and \( BE \) are tangent to the circle at points \( F \) and \( G \) respectively.
  - Tangent segments from the same external point to a circle are congruent (\( AE = BE \)).
  - \( CE \) and \( DE \) are radii of the circle, so \( CE = DE \).
  - \( EF \) is perpendicular to the tangent \( AF \) at the point of tangency \( F \).
  - \( CD \) is a chord, and \( CE \) and \( DE \) are radii.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AE = 8 \)
  - \( BE = 8 \)
  - \( CF = 6 \)

- **Implications**:
  - Since \( AE \) and \( BE \) are tangent segments from the same external point \( B \), they are equal.
  - The radius \( CE \) and \( DE \) are equal because they are radii of the same circle.
  - The length \( CD \) can be split into \( CF + FD \), where \( FD \) is the remaining part of the chord.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of the segment \( FD \).
- To find \( FD \), we need to use the fact that \( CD \) is a chord and the properties of tangents and radii.
- Since \( CF = 6 \) and \( CD = CF + FD \), we need to determine \( FD \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key relationships involve the tangents, radii, and the chord.
- We will use predicates to describe the tangency, equality of tangent segments, radii, and the structure of the chord.
