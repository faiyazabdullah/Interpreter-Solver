STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2608
================================================================================
QUESTION: Triangle L M N is equilateral, and M P bisects L N. Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A triangle labeled \( \triangle LMN \).
  - Points \( L \), \( M \), \( N \), \( P \) are labeled.
  - Line segments \( LM \), \( MN \), \( LN \), and \( MP \) are visible.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( LM = 3x + 1 \).
  - \( MN = 4x - 2 \).
  - \( LN \) is divided into two equal parts by point \( P \): \( LP = PN \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle LMP = 5y^\circ \).
  - \( \angle NMP = 5y^\circ \) (since \( MP \) is the angle bisector).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( MP \) bisects \( \angle LMN \).
  - \( MP \) also bisects \( LN \) into two equal segments.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, meaning all sides are equal: \( LM = MN = LN \).
  - \( MP \) is both the angle bisector of \( \angle LMN \) and the median of \( \triangle LMN \) because it divides \( LN \) into two equal parts.
  - Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, \( MP \) is also the altitude of the triangle.

- **Implied Properties:**
  - In an equilateral triangle, the angle bisector, median, and altitude from a vertex to the opposite side coincide.
  - Each internal angle of an equilateral triangle is \( 60^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle LMN = 60^\circ \).
  - Since \( MP \) bisects \( \angle LMN \), \( \angle LMP = \angle NMP = \frac{1}{2} \times 60^\circ = 30^\circ \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values:**
  - From the diagram, \( LM = 3x + 1 \) and \( MN = 4x - 2 \).
  - Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, \( LM = MN = LN \).
  - The angle \( \angle LMP = 5y^\circ \) and \( \angle NMP = 5y^\circ \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the value of \( y \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The angle bisector property of \( MP \) implies \( \angle LMP = \angle NMP = 30^\circ \).
  - Therefore, \( 5y = 30 \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the equilateral triangle and its properties.
  - Capture the relationships involving the angle bisector and median.
  - Include the given measurements and the derived relationships.
