QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram contains two triangles: \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E \) are labeled.
  - Lines connect these points to form the triangles and intersecting segments.

- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - \( \angle DAB = 47^\circ \)
  - \( \angle ABC = 55^\circ \)
  - \( \angle BAC = 57^\circ \)
  - Angles \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3 \) are formed at point \( E \) where the diagonals intersect.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No special markings (like right angles, parallel lines, etc.) are explicitly indicated.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) share the common side \( AB \).
  - \( \triangle ABD \) has vertices \( A, B, D \).
  - \( \triangle ABC \) has vertices \( A, B, C \).

- **Intersecting Lines**:
  - Diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersect at point \( E \), forming angles \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3 \).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - The sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The angles around point \( E \) must satisfy the property that the sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle DAB = 47^\circ \)
  - \( \angle ABC = 55^\circ \)
  - \( \angle BAC = 57^\circ \)

- **Derived Angles**:
  - In \( \triangle ABD \), we can find \( \angle ADB \) using the triangle angle sum property.
  - In \( \triangle ABC \), we can find \( \angle ACB \) using the triangle angle sum property.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 2 \).
- To find \( \angle 2 \), we need to use the properties of intersecting lines and the angles in the triangles.
- Key relationships involve the angles around point \( E \) and the angles within \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the given angles, the triangles, and the intersecting lines.
- The predicates should capture the relationships between the angles and the geometric shapes without directly solving for \( \angle 2 \).
