REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Quadrilateral \( ACDB \) formed by extending the sides of the triangle.
  - Right triangle \( \triangle ADC \) inside \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AB \): Horizontal side of the larger triangle.
  - \( BC \): Hypotenuse of the larger triangle.
  - \( CD \): Vertical segment forming part of the smaller triangle.
  - \( BD \): Hypotenuse of the smaller triangle.
  - \( AD \): Horizontal segment forming part of the smaller triangle.

- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle ACD \) is a right angle (marked with a square symbol).
  - \( \angle ABD \) is a right angle (implied by the setup).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( BD = 8 \) units (given).
  - \( BC = 12 \) units (hypotenuse of the larger triangle).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles at \( \angle ACD \) and \( \angle ABD \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ADC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle ABD \) is also a right triangle with \( \angle ABD = 90^\circ \).
  - \( BD \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABD \).
  - \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - \( \triangle ADC \) and \( \triangle ABD \) share the side \( AD \).
  - \( BD \) is a segment of \( BC \), and \( D \) lies on \( BC \).
  - Pythagorean theorem applies to both right triangles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( BD = 8 \) units.
  - \( BC = 12 \) units.

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \( D \) lies on \( BC \), \( DC = BC - BD = 12 - 8 = 4 \) units.
  - In \( \triangle ADC \), \( CD = 4 \) units and \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).
  - We need to find \( y \), which is the length of \( AD \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \), which is the length of \( AD \).
- To find \( y \), we use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ADC \):
  \[
  AD^2 + CD^2 = AC^2
  \]
  However, since \( AC \) is not directly given, we first use \( \triangle ABD \) to find \( AD \):
  \[
  AD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all visible geometric shapes, lines, angles, and relationships.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides of the triangles.
- Ensure all predicates are atomic and capture the given information without direct solutions.
