REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure consists of a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D \) are labeled.
  - \( AD \) is drawn perpendicular to \( BC \).
  - \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( AC \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( AB \), \( BC \), \( AC \), \( AD \), and \( BD \) are lines/segments.
  - \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( BC \) (marked with a right angle symbol at \( D \)).
  - \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( AC \) (marked with a right angle symbol at \( A \)).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 10 \) units.
  - \( BD = 5 \) units.
  - No direct measurement is given for \( BC \), \( AC \), or \( DC \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angles are indicated at \( A \) and \( D \).
  - \( AD \) is an altitude of \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - \( AD \) is the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \), dividing \( BC \) into two segments \( BD \) and \( DC \).
  - \( AB \perp AC \) implies \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( AD \perp BC \) implies \( \angle ADB = \angle ADC = 90^\circ \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ADC \) are smaller right triangles formed by the altitude \( AD \).
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to \( \triangle ABC \) and its sub-triangles.
  - The altitude \( AD \) creates similar triangles \( \triangle ABD \sim \triangle ADC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 10 \) units.
  - \( BD = 5 \) units.
  - No direct measurement for \( BC \), \( AC \), or \( DC \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - \( BC = BD + DC \).
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \):
    \[
    AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
    \]
  - Using the altitude properties in right triangles:
    \[
    AD^2 = AB \cdot BD \quad \text{(since \( \triangle ABD \sim \triangle ADC \))}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is the Question Asking?**
  - The question asks for the length of \( BC \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The altitude \( AD \) divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two smaller right triangles, \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ADC \).
  - The Pythagorean theorem will be used to relate the sides of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The altitude properties (such as \( AD^2 = AB \cdot BD \)) will help find missing lengths.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle, points, lines, and right angles.
  - Capture the perpendicular relationships and the altitude property.
  - Include the given measurements and relationships between segments.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are represented.
