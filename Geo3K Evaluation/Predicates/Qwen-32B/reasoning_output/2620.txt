REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines:**
  - \( AB \) is a vertical line segment.
  - \( BC \) is a horizontal line segment.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  
- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle (marked with a square symbol).
  - \( \angle BAC \) is labeled as \( x \).
  - \( \angle ACB \) is labeled as \( 60^\circ \).
  
- **Measurements:**
  - The length of \( AB \) is given as 15 units.
  - The length of \( AC \) is denoted as \( y \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle, indicating \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular to each other.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - \( \angle BAC = x \) and \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \) imply that the triangle's angles satisfy the property of a right triangle: \( x + 60^\circ = 90^\circ \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 15 \) units.
  - \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BAC = x \).

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( \angle BAC + \angle ACB = 90^\circ \), we have \( x + 60^\circ = 90^\circ \). Therefore, \( x = 30^\circ \).
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle, where the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- From the analysis, we determined that \( x = 30^\circ \) based on the angle sum property of the triangle.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships, measurements, and constraints in the figure.
- Predicates will include the triangle, its angles, sides, and the right-angle property.
