### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Line segment \( AB \) is labeled as \( 16\sqrt{3} \).
  - Angle \( \angle BAC \) is labeled as \( 60^\circ \).
  - Angle \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle (marked with a right angle symbol).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 16\sqrt{3} \).
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right angle at \( B \) indicates \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.
  - The \( 60^\circ \) angle at \( A \) suggests trigonometric relationships.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( AB \) is one of the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is the other leg of the triangle, which we need to find (\( y \)).
  - The \( 60^\circ \) angle at \( A \) implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle, where the sides have specific ratios.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AB = 16\sqrt{3} \): This is one of the legs of the triangle.
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \): This angle helps determine the trigonometric relationships.
  - \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \): Confirms the right triangle property.

- **Trigonometric Implications**:
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( BC \)).
  - Therefore, \( AB = \sqrt{3} \times BC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \), which represents the length of \( BC \).
- To find \( y \), we use the relationship in a 30-60-90 triangle:
  \[
  AB = \sqrt{3} \times BC \implies 16\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3} \times y \implies y = 16.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will capture the triangle's structure, the right angle, the angle measures, and the side lengths.
