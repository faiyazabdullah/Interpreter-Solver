================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains a circle with center \( G \).
  - Several points are labeled: \( A, B, C, F, H, J, K, \) and \( I \).
  - Lines connect these points to form tangents and secants to the circle.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - \( \overline{HF} \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( F \).
  - \( \overline{HK} \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( K \).
  - \( \overline{HJ} \) is a straight line passing through the circle.
  - Angles are marked:
    - \( \angle HJK = 26^\circ \).
    - \( \angle HFK = 88^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The tangents \( \overline{HF} \) and \( \overline{HK} \) suggest that \( \angle HFK \) and \( \angle HKF \) are related to the circle's properties.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Tangent Properties:**
  - The tangents \( \overline{HF} \) and \( \overline{HK} \) meet the circle at right angles to the radii drawn to the points of tangency (\( \overline{GF} \) and \( \overline{GK} \)).
  - The tangents from a common external point (\( H \)) to a circle are equal in length (\( HF = HK \)).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - The angle formed by two tangents from a common external point (\( H \)) is related to the intercepted arcs on the circle.
  - The given angles \( \angle HJK = 26^\circ \) and \( \angle HFK = 88^\circ \) suggest relationships involving the intercepted arcs and the central angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle HJK = 26^\circ \).
  - \( \angle HFK = 88^\circ \).

- **Implications:**
  - The angle \( \angle HJK \) is an external angle formed by the tangent \( \overline{HK} \) and the secant \( \overline{HJ} \).
  - The angle \( \angle HFK \) is the angle between the two tangents \( \overline{HF} \) and \( \overline{HK} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Goal:** Find \( m\angle H \).
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The angle between two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is equal to the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs divided by 2.
  - The angle \( \angle HJK \) is part of the larger configuration involving the tangents and secants.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Elements:**
  - Define points, lines, and angles.
  - Use tangent properties and circle theorems.
  - Capture the relationships between angles and arcs.
