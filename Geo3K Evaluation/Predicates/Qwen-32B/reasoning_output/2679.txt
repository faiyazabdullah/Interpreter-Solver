================================================================================
QUESTION: The diagram shows the layout of Elm, Plum, and Oak streets. Find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram includes points labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), \( F \), \( G \), \( H \).
- **Lines**: Several lines are drawn:
  - Line segments connecting \( A \) to \( B \) through \( G \).
  - Line segments connecting \( A \) to \( D \) through \( F \).
  - Vertical lines representing streets labeled "Elm," "Plum," and "Oak."
- **Angles**: 
  - An angle is marked as \( 55^\circ \) at point \( G \) between the line segments \( BG \) and \( HG \).
  - Another angle is marked as \( x^\circ \) at point \( F \) between the line segments \( AF \) and \( DF \).
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols are present at points \( C \), \( E \), and \( F \). This indicates that the streets intersect at right angles.
  - The streets "Elm," "Plum," and "Oak" suggest perpendicular intersections.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Perpendicular Relationships**:
  - The streets "Elm," "Plum," and "Oak" are perpendicular to each other. This implies:
    - Line \( GC \) is perpendicular to Line \( AC \).
    - Line \( FE \) is perpendicular to Line \( AE \).
    - Line \( FD \) is perpendicular to Line \( AF \).
- **Angle Relationships**:
  - The angle at \( G \) is \( 55^\circ \). Since \( GC \) is vertical and \( GB \) is part of the intersection, the angle \( \angle HGB = 55^\circ \).
  - The angle at \( F \) is \( x^\circ \). Since \( FD \) is vertical and \( FA \) is part of the intersection, \( \angle DFA = x^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle HGB = 55^\circ \).
  - \( \angle DFA = x^\circ \).
- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle GCF = 90^\circ \), \( \angle EFD = 90^\circ \), and \( \angle AFC = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- From the diagram, we observe that the streets form a series of perpendicular intersections, and the angle \( x \) is related to the angle \( 55^\circ \) through these perpendicular relationships.
- Using the property of complementary angles in perpendicular intersections, we can deduce the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the perpendicular relationships, the given angle \( 55^\circ \), and the angle \( x \).
- The key relationships involve the complementary nature of angles formed by perpendicular lines.
