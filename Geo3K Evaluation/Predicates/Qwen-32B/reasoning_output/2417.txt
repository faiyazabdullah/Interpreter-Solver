REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram shows a circle centered at point \( P \).
  - Points \( Q, R, S, T \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The center \( P \) is connected to these points, forming radii of the circle.
  
- **Lines and Arcs**:
  - Lines \( PR, PS, PT, PQ \) are radii of the circle.
  - Arcs \( \widehat{QR}, \widehat{RS}, \widehat{ST}, \widehat{TQ} \) are parts of the circle's circumference.
  
- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - Angles are labeled at the center \( P \):
    - \( \angle QPR = 112^\circ \)
    - \( \angle RPS = 130^\circ \)
  - The radius of the circle is given as 2 inches.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruence symbols are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( P \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( Q, R, S, T \) are points on the circumference, so \( PQ, PR, PS, PT \) are radii of the circle.
  - The arcs \( \widehat{QR}, \widehat{RS}, \widehat{ST}, \widehat{TQ} \) are subtended by the central angles \( \angle QPR, \angle RPS, \angle SPT, \angle TPQ \), respectively.
  
- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The sum of the central angles around the center \( P \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The length of an arc is proportional to its central angle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - Central angle \( \angle QPR = 112^\circ \)
  - Central angle \( \angle RPS = 130^\circ \)
  - Radius of the circle \( r = 2 \) inches.
  
- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The length of an arc can be calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Arc length} = 2\pi r \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Central angle}}{360^\circ}\right)
    \]
  - Here, we need to find the length of \( \widehat{RS} \), which corresponds to the central angle \( \angle RPS = 130^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - Find the length of the arc \( \widehat{RS} \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The length of an arc depends on the radius and the central angle subtending it.
  - The radius is given as 2 inches, and the central angle for \( \widehat{RS} \) is \( 130^\circ \).
  
- **Information Needed**:
  - Use the formula for arc length:
    \[
    \text{Arc length} = 2\pi r \cdot \left(\frac{\text{Central angle}}{360^\circ}\right)
    \]
  - Substitute \( r = 2 \) inches and \( \text{Central angle} = 130^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Define the points on the circumference and their connections to the center.
  - Specify the central angles.
  - Use the radius and central angle to compute the arc length.
