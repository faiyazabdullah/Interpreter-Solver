REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains several points labeled \( G, K, J, H, I \).
  - There are multiple line segments connecting these points.
  - A right angle symbol is present at point \( K \) indicating \( \angle GKH \) is a right angle.
  - Another right angle symbol is present at point \( H \) indicating \( \angle HKI \) is a right angle.
  - Arrowheads indicate that certain line segments are parallel: \( JK \parallel HI \).

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( GJ = 8 \)
  - \( GH = 12 \)
  - \( HI = 4 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols at \( K \) and \( H \) indicate perpendicularity.
  - Arrowheads indicate parallelism between \( JK \) and \( HI \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle GKH \) is a right triangle with \( \angle GKH = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle HKI \) is also a right triangle with \( \angle HKI = 90^\circ \).
  - \( JK \parallel HI \) implies that \( \triangle GJK \) and \( \triangle GHI \) are similar by AA similarity (both have right angles and share \( \angle KGJ \)).
  - Since \( JK \parallel HI \), the corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( GJ = 8 \)
  - \( GH = 12 \)
  - \( HI = 4 \)

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - The similarity of \( \triangle GJK \) and \( \triangle GHI \) implies the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
    \[
    \frac{GJ}{GH} = \frac{JK}{HI}
    \]
  - Using the given measurements, we can set up the proportion:
    \[
    \frac{8}{12} = \frac{JK}{4}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - Find the length of \( KJ \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The similarity of triangles \( GJK \) and \( GHI \) allows us to use the ratio of corresponding sides to find \( JK \).
  - Once \( JK \) is found, we can use it to determine \( KJ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangles, points, lines, and angles.
  - Capture the right angles and parallelism.
  - Include the given measurements and the relationships between them.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are represented.
