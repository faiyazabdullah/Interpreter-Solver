REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Left Diagram:**
  - **Points:** R, T, S
  - **Lines/Segments:**
    - RT = 15
    - TS = 10
    - RS = 20.7
  - **Angles:**
    - ∠RST = 43°
    - ∠TRS = 27°
    - ∠RTS = 110°
  - **Triangles:** Triangle RST
  - **Measurements:**
    - RT = 15
    - TS = 10
    - RS = 20.7

- **Right Diagram:**
  - **Points:** E, F, G, X
  - **Lines/Segments:**
    - EF = 11.25
    - FG = Unknown (GF)
    - EG = Unknown (GFX)
  - **Angles:**
    - ∠EFG = 110°
    - ∠FEG = 27°
    - ∠EFG = 110°
  - **Triangles:** Triangle EFG
  - **Measurements:**
    - EF = 11.25

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Left Diagram:**
  - Triangle RST is a scalene triangle.
  - The sides and angles are explicitly given.
  - The sum of the interior angles of triangle RST is 180°.

- **Right Diagram:**
  - Triangle EFG is a scalene triangle.
  - The angles ∠EFG = 110° and ∠FEG = 27° imply that ∠EGF = 43° (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°).
  - Both triangles RST and EFG have corresponding angles that are equal (∠RST = ∠EGF = 43°, ∠TRS = ∠FEG = 27°, ∠RTS = ∠EFG = 110°).

- **Similarity:**
  - The two triangles RST and EFG are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion because they share the same set of angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Left Diagram:**
  - RT = 15
  - TS = 10
  - RS = 20.7

- **Right Diagram:**
  - EF = 11.25
  - The corresponding sides of the similar triangles are proportional.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of GF in the right diagram.
- Since the triangles RST and EFG are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant.
- We need to use the similarity ratio to find the unknown length GF.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the geometric shapes and their properties.
- Define the similarity relationship between the triangles.
- Use the given measurements to establish the similarity ratio.
- Avoid directly solving for GF but ensure the relationship is represented in the predicates.
