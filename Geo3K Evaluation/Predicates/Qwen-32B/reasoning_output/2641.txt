================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is an external point \( D \) on the extension of side \( CB \).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - Line \( CD \) extends from \( C \) through \( B \).

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( \angle DBC = 148^\circ \) (external angle at \( B \)).
  - \( \angle CAB = 2x - 15 \) (internal angle at \( A \)).
  - \( \angle ABC = x - 5 \) (internal angle at \( B \)).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings indicating right angles, congruence, or parallelism.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a standard triangle with three internal angles.
  - The external angle \( \angle DBC \) is related to the internal angles of the triangle via the External Angle Theorem.
  - The sum of the internal angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The external angle \( \angle DBC \) is the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles of the triangle.
  - The internal angles of \( \triangle ABC \) must satisfy the equation \( \angle CAB + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle DBC = 148^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CAB = 2x - 15 \).
  - \( \angle ABC = x - 5 \).

- **Relationships:**
  - Using the External Angle Theorem: \( \angle DBC = \angle CAB + \angle BCA \).
  - Since \( \angle BCA \) is not directly given, it can be expressed in terms of \( x \) using the triangle angle sum property.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the measure of \( \angle ABC \), denoted as \( m\angle ABC \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The External Angle Theorem: \( \angle DBC = \angle CAB + \angle BCA \).
  - The Triangle Angle Sum Theorem: \( \angle CAB + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ \).

- **Information Needed:**
  - Express \( \angle BCA \) in terms of \( x \).
  - Solve for \( x \) using the given external angle \( \angle DBC = 148^\circ \).
  - Substitute \( x \) to find \( \angle ABC = x - 5 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent:**
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - The lines forming the sides of the triangle and the extension.
  - The angles and their measures.
  - The relationships between the angles using the External Angle Theorem and the Triangle Angle Sum Theorem.

- **Ensuring Completeness:**
  - All visible measurements and relationships are captured.
  - Predicates are atomic and do not directly state the final answer.
