================================================================================
QUESTION: Find h in the triangle.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The vertices are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( A \).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - \( \overline{AB} \) is the horizontal base of the triangle.
  - \( \overline{AC} \) is the vertical height of the triangle, labeled as \( h \).
  - \( \overline{BC} \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle, labeled as 22 units.
  - There is an angle \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right angle at \( A \) is marked with a square symbol.
  - The angle \( \angle ABC \) is explicitly labeled as \( 30^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with a right angle at \( A \).
  - \( \overline{AB} \) and \( \overline{AC} \) are perpendicular.
  - \( \overline{BC} \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The triangle has one known angle \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \), making it a 30-60-90 triangle.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides have a specific ratio:
    - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( \overline{AC} \)) is half the hypotenuse.
    - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( \overline{AB} \)) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The hypotenuse \( \overline{BC} = 22 \) units.
  - The angle \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \).

- **Relationships**:
  - The height \( h \) (side \( \overline{AC} \)) is opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.
  - The base \( \overline{AB} \) is opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( h \), which is the length of \( \overline{AC} \).
- To find \( h \), we use the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:
  - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle is half the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate framework.
- The predicates will include the triangle, its sides, angles, and the specific properties of the 30-60-90 triangle.
