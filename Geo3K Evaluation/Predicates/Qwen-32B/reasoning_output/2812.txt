REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is centered at point \( V \).
  - Four points \( W, X, Y, Z \) lie on the circumference of the circle, forming a quadrilateral \( WXYZ \).
  - The center \( V \) of the circle is marked, indicating it is the circumcenter of the quadrilateral.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Lines \( VW, VX, VY, VZ \) are radii of the circle.
  - Two angles are explicitly marked:
    - \( \angle WVZ = 60^\circ \)
    - \( \angle WVW = 95^\circ \) (This appears to be a typo; it should likely be \( \angle WZX = 95^\circ \). I will assume \( \angle WZX = 95^\circ \) for consistency).

- **Other Observations:**
  - The quadrilateral \( WXYZ \) is inscribed in the circle, meaning it is a cyclic quadrilateral.
  - No additional markings indicate perpendicularity, parallelism, or specific side lengths.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties:**
  - Since \( WXYZ \) is inscribed in the circle, it is a cyclic quadrilateral. This implies that opposite angles sum to \( 180^\circ \):
    \[
    \angle W + \angle Y = 180^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \angle X + \angle Z = 180^\circ.
    \]

- **Central Angles and Inscribed Angles:**
  - The central angle \( \angle WVZ = 60^\circ \) subtends the arc \( WZ \).
  - The inscribed angle \( \angle WYZ \) subtends the same arc \( WZ \). By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle:
    \[
    \angle WYZ = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle WVZ = \frac{1}{2} \times 60^\circ = 30^\circ.
    \]

- **Given Angles:**
  - \( \angle WZX = 95^\circ \) is explicitly given.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Explicit Measurements:**
  - \( \angle WVZ = 60^\circ \)
  - \( \angle WZX = 95^\circ \)

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - From the Inscribed Angle Theorem, \( \angle WYZ = 30^\circ \).
  - Since \( WXYZ \) is a cyclic quadrilateral, we use the property that opposite angles sum to \( 180^\circ \):
    \[
    \angle X + \angle Z = 180^\circ.
    \]
    Given \( \angle Z = \angle WZX = 95^\circ \), we find:
    \[
    \angle X = 180^\circ - 95^\circ = 85^\circ.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle X \).
- From the analysis, we have determined that \( \angle X = 85^\circ \).
- The relevant geometric properties used are the Inscribed Angle Theorem and the property of cyclic quadrilaterals.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates should capture the cyclic nature of the quadrilateral, the central and inscribed angles, and the given angle measures.
