REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle centered at point \( O \).
  - A tangent line \( MP \) to the circle at point \( P \).
  - A secant line \( MA \) passing through the circle, intersecting it at points \( C \) and \( A \).
  - Points \( M \), \( P \), \( R \), \( B \), \( C \), \( A \), and \( O \) are labeled.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( MP \): Tangent to the circle at \( P \).
  - \( MA \): Secant line passing through the circle.
  - \( MO \): Line segment from the external point \( M \) to the center \( O \).
  - \( OP \): Radius of the circle.
  - \( OC \): Radius of the circle.
  - \( OA \): Radius of the circle.
  
- **Measurements:**
  - \( MP = 16 \).
  - \( PR = 5 \).
  - \( MO = 20 \).
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - \( MP \) is tangent to the circle at \( P \).
  - Right angle symbol at \( M \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( MP \) is tangent to the circle at \( P \), so \( OP \perp MP \).
  - \( MO \) is a straight line passing through the external point \( M \) and the center \( O \).
  - \( MA \) is a secant line intersecting the circle at points \( C \) and \( A \).
  - The power of a point theorem applies here because \( M \) is an external point relative to the circle.
  
- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - Since \( MP \) is tangent, \( OP \perp MP \).
  - The lengths \( MC \) and \( MA \) are segments of the secant line.
  - The power of point \( M \) gives us a relationship involving the tangent segment \( MP \) and the secant segments \( MC \) and \( MA \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( MP = 16 \).
  - \( PR = 5 \).
  - \( MO = 20 \).
  
- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Since \( MO = 20 \) and \( MP = 16 \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle MOP \) to find \( OP \).
  - The power of point \( M \) theorem states: \( MP^2 = MC \cdot MA \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Find the value of \( x \), which represents the length of segment \( MC \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The power of a point theorem: \( MP^2 = MC \cdot MA \).
  - The Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle MOP \) to find the radius \( OP \).
  
- **Information Needed:**
  - Length of \( MA \) (which is \( MC + CA \)).
  - Use the power of a point theorem to relate \( MP \), \( MC \), and \( MA \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - Define the circle, its center, and the tangent/secant lines.
  
- **Predicates for Measurements:**
  - Assign lengths to segments \( MP \), \( PR \), and \( MO \).
  
- **Predicates for Relationships:**
  - Use the power of a point theorem and the Pythagorean theorem to establish relationships between the segments.
