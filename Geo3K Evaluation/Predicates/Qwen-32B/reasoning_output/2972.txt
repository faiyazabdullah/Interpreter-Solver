### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram consists of multiple triangles formed by intersecting lines.
  - Key points identified: \( S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z \).
  - Key lines: \( ST, TU, US, SY, YZ, ZS, UV, VS, TJ, JV \).

- **Visible Measurements**:
  - \( UJ = 9 \)
  - \( VJ = 3 \)
  - \( ZT = 18 \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - Parallel lines are indicated by double pink lines: \( ST \parallel UV \), \( SY \parallel UV \), \( ZT \parallel UV \).
  - Right angles are indicated at \( Z \), suggesting specific perpendicular relationships.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - \( ST \parallel UV \)
  - \( SY \parallel UV \)
  - \( ZT \parallel UV \)
  - These parallel lines suggest that certain segments are proportional due to similar triangles.

- **Intersections and Proportions**:
  - Point \( J \) is a common intersection point for multiple lines, dividing segments proportionally.
  - Since \( ST \parallel UV \), triangles \( STJ \) and \( UVJ \) are similar by the AA similarity criterion.
  - Similarly, other parallel lines imply additional proportional relationships.

- **Proportional Segments**:
  - Given \( UJ = 9 \) and \( VJ = 3 \), the ratio \( \frac{UJ}{VJ} = 3 \).
  - This ratio applies to other corresponding segments due to the similarity of triangles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( UJ = 9 \)
  - \( VJ = 3 \)
  - \( ZT = 18 \)

- **Implications**:
  - Since \( ST \parallel UV \), the triangles \( STJ \) and \( UVJ \) are similar, and the ratio of corresponding sides is consistent.
  - The segment \( ZT = 18 \) provides a reference for the scaling factor in the diagram.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length \( SJ \).
- To find \( SJ \), we need to use the proportional relationships derived from the similar triangles and the given measurements.
- The key is to leverage the similarity ratios and the given lengths to determine \( SJ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships, including parallelism, similarity, and proportionalities.
- The predicates should capture the given measurements and the implications of the parallel lines and similar triangles.
