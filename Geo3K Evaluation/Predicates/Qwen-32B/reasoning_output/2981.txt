================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the rhombus.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The image shows a rhombus \(ABCD\).
- **Points**: The vertices of the rhombus are labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- **Lines**: The sides of the rhombus are \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\). The diagonals are \(AC\) and \(BD\).
- **Measurements**: 
  - The length of diagonal \(AC\) is given as \(22 \, \text{mm}\).
  - The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given as \(12 \, \text{mm}\).
- **Special Markings**: 
  - The diagonals intersect at point \(D\) and appear to be perpendicular to each other, as indicated by the right-angle symbol at the intersection.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Rhombus**:
  - All sides are equal in length.
  - The diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
  - The diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.
- **Relationships**:
  - Diagonal \(AC\) bisects diagonal \(BD\) at point \(D\).
  - Diagonal \(BD\) bisects diagonal \(AC\) at point \(D\).
  - The diagonals are perpendicular: \(AC \perp BD\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Length of diagonal \(AC = 22 \, \text{mm}\).
  - Length of diagonal \(BD = 12 \, \text{mm}\).
- **Implications**:
  - Since the diagonals bisect each other, the segments created by the intersection are:
    - \(AD = DC = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{22}{2} = 11 \, \text{mm}\).
    - \(BD = DB = \frac{BD}{2} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \, \text{mm}\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **area of the rhombus**.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
    \[
    \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
    \]
    where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.
  - Here, \(d_1 = AC = 22 \, \text{mm}\) and \(d_2 = BD = 12 \, \text{mm}\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the image.
- The predicates should capture the shape, diagonals, their lengths, and their perpendicularity.
- Avoid including the final calculation or solution in the predicates.
