================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is depicted with center \( F \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersect at point \( F \).

- **Labels and Measurements:**
  - \( \angle BFD = 72^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AFD = (2a - 5)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CFD = (4a - 1)^\circ \).
  - \( AC \) is marked as the diameter of the circle.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruent segments are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - Since \( AC \) is the diameter, \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle ADC \) are right angles (by the inscribed angle theorem).
  - The circle is centered at \( F \), and \( F \) is the midpoint of the diameter \( AC \).

- **Intersecting Chords:**
  - The lines \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersect at \( F \), dividing the circle into four angles: \( \angle AFB, \angle BFC, \angle CFD, \) and \( \angle DFA \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - The sum of the angles around point \( F \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The angles formed by intersecting chords have specific relationships based on the circle's properties.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles:**
  - \( \angle BFD = 72^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AFD = (2a - 5)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CFD = (4a - 1)^\circ \).

- **Unknowns:**
  - The value of \( a \) needs to be determined to find the measures of \( \angle AFD \) and \( \angle CFD \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle CFD \).
- To solve this, we need to use the fact that the sum of the angles around point \( F \) is \( 360^\circ \). This will allow us to set up an equation involving \( a \) and solve for \( \angle CFD \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will include the circle, points, lines, angles, and their measurements.
- The relationships between the angles around point \( F \) will be captured using the sum of angles property.
