REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains a triangle labeled \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Point \( B \) is connected to point \( D \) inside the triangle, dividing it into smaller triangles.
  
- **Lines:**
  - Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) form the sides of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Line \( BD \) is drawn from vertex \( B \) to point \( D \) on side \( AC \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle ABC = 45^\circ \) (labeled).
  - \( \angle BAC = 70^\circ \) (labeled).
  - \( \angle BCA = 40^\circ \) (labeled).
  - \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), and \( \angle 3 \) are internal angles formed by the division of the triangle by line \( BD \).

- **Labels and Measurements:**
  - \( \angle 2 = 45^\circ \) (labeled).
  - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are unlabeled but need to be determined.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Properties:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a triangle with known angles \( \angle BAC = 70^\circ \), \( \angle ABC = 45^\circ \), and \( \angle BCA = 40^\circ \).
  - The sum of the interior angles of \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 180^\circ \).

- **Line \( BD \):**
  - Line \( BD \) divides \( \triangle ABC \) into two smaller triangles: \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BCD \).
  - \( \angle 2 = 45^\circ \) is part of \( \triangle ABD \).
  - \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are angles in \( \triangle BCD \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - In \( \triangle BCD \), the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 3 \) is one of the angles in \( \triangle BCD \), and we need to determine its measure.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles:**
  - \( \angle BAC = 70^\circ \)
  - \( \angle ABC = 45^\circ \)
  - \( \angle BCA = 40^\circ \)
  - \( \angle 2 = 45^\circ \)

- **Derived Angles:**
  - Since \( \angle 2 = 45^\circ \) is part of \( \triangle ABD \), the remaining angles in \( \triangle ABD \) can be calculated.
  - In \( \triangle BCD \), the sum of the angles must be \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 3 \).
- To find \( \angle 3 \), we need to use the angle sum property of \( \triangle BCD \):
  \[
  \angle 1 + \angle 3 + \angle BCA = 180^\circ
  \]
- We need to determine \( \angle 1 \) first, which is part of \( \triangle ABD \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all visible geometric shapes, points, lines, and angles.
- Capture the angle sum properties and relationships between the angles.
- Ensure all given measurements and relationships are included.
