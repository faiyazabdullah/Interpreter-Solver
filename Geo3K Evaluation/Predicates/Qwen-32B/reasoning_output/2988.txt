================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are labeled.
  - \( B \) is the right angle vertex.

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - \( AB \) is one leg of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is the other leg of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - There is a marked angle \( \angle C \) with a measure of \( 21^\circ \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The length of \( AB \) is given as 11 units.
  - The length of the hypotenuse \( AC \) is labeled as \( x \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle ABC \), indicating \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - \( \angle CAB \) and \( \angle BCA \) are complementary to \( \angle ABC \).

- **Trigonometric Implications:**
  - Since \( \angle C = 21^\circ \), we can use trigonometric ratios involving \( \sin \), \( \cos \), or \( \tan \) to relate the sides of the triangle.
  - Specifically, \( \sin(21^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{AB}{AC} \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 11 \) units.
  - \( \angle C = 21^\circ \).
  - \( AC = x \) (to be determined).

- **Relationships:**
  - Using trigonometry, \( \sin(21^\circ) = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{11}{x} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of the hypotenuse \( AC \), denoted as \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the sine function:
  \[
  \sin(21^\circ) = \frac{11}{x}
  \]
  Rearranging gives:
  \[
  x = \frac{11}{\sin(21^\circ)}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates will include the triangle, its sides, angles, and the trigonometric relationship.
