REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a quadrilateral \( JKLM \), which is explicitly labeled as a parallelogram.
  - There is a point \( R \) inside the parallelogram, which appears to be the intersection of diagonals \( JL \) and \( KM \).
  - Triangles \( JKL \), \( MKL \), and others are formed within the parallelogram.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( JK = 2b + 3 \)
  - \( KL = 21 \)
  - \( LM = 45 \)
  - \( MJ = 3a \)
  
- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle MLK = 70^\circ \)
  - \( \angle JMK = 30^\circ \)
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - No explicit right-angle symbols or parallel markings are shown, but the parallelogram property implies opposite sides are parallel and equal.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Parallelogram Properties:**
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \( JK \parallel ML \) and \( JM \parallel KL \).
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( JK = ML \) and \( JM = KL \).
  
- **Diagonals:**
  - Diagonals \( JL \) and \( KM \) intersect at \( R \), which is the midpoint of both diagonals (property of parallelograms).
  
- **Triangles:**
  - Triangles \( JKL \), \( MKL \), and \( JRM \) are formed. The angles and sides of these triangles will help in solving for \( \angle KJL \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( KL = 21 \)
  - \( LM = 45 \)
  - \( JK = 2b + 3 \)
  - \( MJ = 3a \)
  
- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle MLK = 70^\circ \)
  - \( \angle JMK = 30^\circ \)
  
- **Implications:**
  - Since \( JKLM \) is a parallelogram, \( JK = ML = 45 \). Therefore, \( 2b + 3 = 45 \), implying \( b = 21 \).
  - Similarly, \( JM = KL = 21 \), so \( 3a = 21 \), implying \( a = 7 \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The problem asks for \( m\angle KJL \), the measure of angle \( \angle KJL \).
- To find \( \angle KJL \), we use the properties of the parallelogram and the given angles. Specifically, we need to analyze the triangle \( JKL \) and use the fact that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Predicates will cover the parallelogram properties, side lengths, angles, and the intersection of diagonals.
