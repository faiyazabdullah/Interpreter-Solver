STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2809
================================================================================
QUESTION: The ratio of the measure of the angles of the triangle below is 3 : 2 : 1. Which of the following is not an angle measure of the triangle?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The vertices are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

- **Lines**:
  - The sides of the triangle are represented by lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \).

- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( B \), indicated by the small square symbol.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings such as congruence or parallelism are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle because there is a right angle at \( B \).
  - The sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - No numerical measurements are explicitly given in the diagram.
  - However, the problem states that the ratio of the measures of the angles in \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 3 : 2 : 1 \).

- **Interpretation**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, one of its angles is \( 90^\circ \). This corresponds to the largest angle in the ratio \( 3 : 2 : 1 \).
  - Therefore, the angles can be assigned as follows:
    - The largest angle (right angle) is \( 3x \), where \( 3x = 90^\circ \).
    - Solving for \( x \): \( x = 30^\circ \).
    - The other two angles are \( 2x \) and \( x \), which are \( 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ \) and \( 1 \times 30^\circ = 30^\circ \), respectively.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Question**:
  - The problem asks which of the following is **not** an angle measure of the triangle.
  - The angle measures derived from the ratio \( 3 : 2 : 1 \) are \( 90^\circ \), \( 60^\circ \), and \( 30^\circ \).
  - Any angle measure not among these three is the answer.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the triangle, its vertices, sides, and the right angle.
  - Capture the ratio of the angles and their measures.
  - Ensure all visible geometric relationships are included.
