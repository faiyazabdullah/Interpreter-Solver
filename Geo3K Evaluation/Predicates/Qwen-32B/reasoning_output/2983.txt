QUESTION: Cut four congruent triangles off the corners of a rectangle to make an octagon. What is the area of the octagon?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes Identified**:
  - A large rectangle with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D \).
  - An octagon formed inside the rectangle after removing four right-angled triangles from the corners.
  - Four right-angled triangles are cut off from the corners of the rectangle.

- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M \).
  - Lines: \( AB, BC, CD, DA \) form the rectangle.
  - Lines forming the triangles at the corners: \( AE, EF, FB, BG, GC, CH, HD, DI, IJ, JK, KL, LA \).

- **Measurements**:
  - Rectangle dimensions: \( AB = 30 \) cm (width), \( AD = 20 \) cm (height).
  - Side lengths of the removed triangles: \( AE = BF = CG = DH = 6 \) cm (legs of the right triangles).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols at the corners of the triangles (\( E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L \)).
  - The octagon is shaded, indicating the region of interest.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships**:
  - The four triangles (\( \triangle AEF, \triangle BFG, \triangle CGH, \triangle DHI \)) are congruent right triangles.
  - The legs of each triangle are equal to 6 cm.
  - The octagon is formed by removing these four triangles from the rectangle.
  - The remaining sides of the octagon are segments of the original rectangle's sides.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - Rectangle width: \( AB = 30 \) cm.
  - Rectangle height: \( AD = 20 \) cm.
  - Triangle leg lengths: \( AE = BF = CG = DH = 6 \) cm.
  - The hypotenuses of the triangles are not explicitly given but can be calculated if needed.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The area of the octagon formed after cutting off the four congruent right triangles from the corners of the rectangle.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The area of the rectangle.
  - The area of the four congruent right triangles.
  - The area of the octagon is the area of the rectangle minus the total area of the four triangles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the rectangle and its dimensions.
  - Define the four congruent right triangles and their dimensions.
  - Define the octagon as the region left after removing the triangles from the rectangle.
  - Capture all geometric relationships and measurements without directly calculating the final answer.
