REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a circle with center \( S \).
  - Points \( P \), \( Q \), \( R \), and \( T \) are marked on or related to the circle.
  - Line segments \( PQ \), \( QR \), and \( PR \) are chords of the circle.
  - Point \( T \) is marked as the midpoint of chord \( PR \).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Line \( QS \) is a radius of the circle.
  - Line \( QT \) is drawn from the center \( S \) to the midpoint \( T \) of chord \( PR \).
  - There is a right angle symbol at \( \angle QTS \), indicating \( \angle QTS = 90^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The arc \( \widehat{PQR} \) is labeled with a measure of \( 98^\circ \).
  - The length of segment \( TR \) is given as 6 units.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties**:
  - \( S \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( QS \), \( RS \), and \( PS \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( PR \) is a chord of the circle, and \( T \) is its midpoint.
  - Since \( QT \perp PR \), \( QT \) is the perpendicular bisector of chord \( PR \).

- **Arcs and Angles**:
  - The measure of the arc \( \widehat{PQR} \) is given as \( 98^\circ \).
  - The central angle subtended by \( \widehat{PQR} \) is also \( 98^\circ \).

- **Chords and Midpoints**:
  - Since \( T \) is the midpoint of \( PR \), \( PT = TR = 6 \) units.
  - The perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( m\widehat{PQR} = 98^\circ \).
  - \( TR = 6 \) units.

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \( T \) is the midpoint of \( PR \), \( PT = TR = 6 \) units.
  - The total length of chord \( PR \) is \( PT + TR = 6 + 6 = 12 \) units.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{PQ} \).
- To solve this, we need to use the fact that the measure of an arc is determined by the central angle subtending it.
- Since \( m\widehat{PQR} = 98^\circ \), and \( \widehat{PQR} \) is composed of \( \widehat{PQ} \) and \( \widehat{QR} \), we need to determine the measures of \( \widehat{PQ} \) and \( \widehat{QR} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements clearly.
- Predicates will include the circle, points, lines, angles, and the given arc measurements.
- We will not include the final answer but will represent all necessary relationships to enable solving the problem.
