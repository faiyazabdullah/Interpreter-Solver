REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the primary shape.
  - Four vertices are labeled: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  
- **Lines**:
  - Lines connecting the vertices form the sides of the quadrilateral: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\).

- **Angles**:
  - Angles are labeled at vertices \(A\) and \(D\):
    - \(\angle A = 3x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle D = x^\circ\)
  - Right angles are marked at vertices \(B\) and \(C\):
    - \(\angle B = 90^\circ\)
    - \(\angle C = 90^\circ\)

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right angle symbols at \(B\) and \(C\) indicate that \(AB \perp BC\) and \(BC \perp CD\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties**:
  - The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has two right angles at \(B\) and \(C\).
  - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).

- **Right Angles**:
  - \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) are both right angles, so:
    - \(\angle B = 90^\circ\)
    - \(\angle C = 90^\circ\)

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - The remaining angles \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) are labeled as \(3x^\circ\) and \(x^\circ\), respectively.
  - These angles, along with the right angles, satisfy the property that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \(\angle A = 3x^\circ\)
  - \(\angle D = x^\circ\)
  - \(\angle B = 90^\circ\)
  - \(\angle C = 90^\circ\)

- **Sum of Interior Angles**:
  - The sum of the interior angles of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
    \[
    \angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    3x + 90 + 90 + x = 360
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle A\).
- To find \(\angle A\), we need to determine the value of \(x\) using the angle sum property of the quadrilateral.
- Once \(x\) is found, \(\angle A = 3x^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will include the quadrilateral, its vertices, lines, angles, and the specific angle measurements.
- The relationships between the angles and the sum of the interior angles will also be included.
