QUESTION: Find m \angle W.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( X, Y, Z, W \).
  
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \( X, Y, Z, W \)
  - Lines: \( XY, YZ, ZW, WX \)
  
- **Angles**:
  - Angles are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( \angle X = x^\circ \)
    - \( \angle Y = 2x^\circ \)
    - \( \angle Z = 4x^\circ \)
    - \( \angle W = 3x^\circ \)
  
- **Other Observations**:
  - No additional markings such as parallel lines, right angles, or congruent sides are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties**:
  - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \( 360^\circ \).
  - The angles are expressed in terms of \( x \), indicating a proportional relationship among the angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The angles are given as \( x, 2x, 3x, \) and \( 4x \).
  - These expressions represent the measures of the angles at vertices \( X, Y, Z, \) and \( W \), respectively.
  
- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - The sum of the angles in the quadrilateral is:
    \[
    x + 2x + 3x + 4x = 360^\circ
    \]
  - Simplifying, we get:
    \[
    10x = 360^\circ \implies x = 36^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle W \).
  
- **Relevant Information**:
  - The measure of \( \angle W \) is given as \( 3x \).
  - From the previous step, we determined \( x = 36^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the quadrilateral and its vertices.
  - Define the angles and their relationships.
  - Capture the sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral.
  - Express the measure of \( \angle W \) in terms of \( x \).
