STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2591
================================================================================
QUESTION: A regular pentagon and a square share a mutual vertex X. The sides X Y and X Z are sides of a third regular polygon with a vertex at X. How many sides does this polygon have?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes Identified:**
  - A **regular pentagon** with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D, Z \).
  - A **square** with vertices labeled \( X, Y, B, C \).
  - A **third regular polygon** (to be determined) with one vertex at \( X \) and sides \( XY \) and \( XZ \).

- **Points, Lines, and Angles:**
  - Points: \( A, B, C, D, Z, X, Y \).
  - Lines: \( AB, BC, CD, DA, AZ, XB, XC, XY, XZ, YC, ZA \).
  - Angles: Internal angles of the pentagon, square, and the third polygon.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The pentagon is labeled as a regular pentagon, implying all sides and internal angles are equal.
  - The square is labeled as a regular square, implying all sides are equal and all internal angles are right angles (\( 90^\circ \)).
  - The third polygon has two sides \( XY \) and \( XZ \) emanating from \( X \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Regular Pentagon Properties:**
  - All sides are equal: \( AB = BC = CD = DA = AZ \).
  - All internal angles are equal: Each internal angle of a regular pentagon is \( 108^\circ \).

- **Square Properties:**
  - All sides are equal: \( XY = YC = CB = BX \).
  - All internal angles are right angles: \( \angle XYC = \angle YCB = \angle CBC = \angle BXC = 90^\circ \).

- **Third Polygon Properties:**
  - The polygon is regular, so all its sides and internal angles are equal.
  - Two sides of this polygon are \( XY \) and \( XZ \), both sharing the common vertex \( X \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - No explicit numerical lengths or angles are provided in the diagram.
  - However, we know the following:
    - The internal angle of a regular pentagon is \( 108^\circ \).
    - The internal angle of a square is \( 90^\circ \).
    - The internal angle of the third polygon needs to be determined.

- **Relationship Between Angles:**
  - At vertex \( X \), the angle between \( XY \) and \( XZ \) is part of the internal angle of the third polygon.
  - The total angle around point \( X \) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - Determine the number of sides of the third regular polygon.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The sum of the internal angles around point \( X \) must be \( 360^\circ \).
  - The internal angle of a regular polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:
    \[
    \text{Internal angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180^\circ}{n}
    \]
  - The angle between \( XY \) and \( XZ \) is part of the internal angle of the third polygon.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Known Information:**
  - Define the pentagon, square, and third polygon.
  - Specify the regularity of each shape.
  - Relate the angles and sides of the shapes.

- **Predicates for Relationships:**
  - Use the fact that the total angle around point \( X \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Relate the internal angles of the pentagon, square, and third polygon.
