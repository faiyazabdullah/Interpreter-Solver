STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2432
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The figure is a rectangle. It has four sides and four right angles.
- **Points**: The vertices are labeled as \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the rectangle are formed by the lines connecting these points:
  - \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), and \( DA \).
- **Measurements**:
  - The length of side \( AB \) is given as 9 inches.
  - The length of side \( AD \) is given as 16 inches.
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols are present at all four corners (\( \angle DAB \), \( \angle ABC \), \( \angle BCD \), \( \angle CDA \)), confirming it is a rectangle.
  - The opposite sides are parallel, as is typical for a rectangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Opposite sides of a rectangle are equal and parallel:
    - \( AB = CD = 9 \) inches.
    - \( AD = BC = 16 \) inches.
  - All interior angles are right angles:
    - \( \angle DAB = \angle ABC = \angle BCD = \angle CDA = 90^\circ \).
  - The diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length, although their length is not required for the area calculation.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 9 \) inches (height of the rectangle).
  - \( AD = 16 \) inches (width of the rectangle).
- **Interpretation**:
  - The given measurements directly correspond to the dimensions of the rectangle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **area** of the rectangle.
- The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
  \]
- From the image, the width is \( AD = 16 \) inches, and the height is \( AB = 9 \) inches.
- The relevant geometric property is the relationship between the sides of the rectangle and its area.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle, its dimensions, and the relationships between its sides.
- Predicates will include the definition of the rectangle, the lengths of its sides, and the right angles at its corners.
