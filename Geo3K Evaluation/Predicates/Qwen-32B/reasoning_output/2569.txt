REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a circle with center \( J \).
  - There are several points on the circumference of the circle: \( F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I \).
  - Lines connect these points to form chords and intersect inside the circle at point \( J \).

- **Lines and Chords:**
  - Chords are formed by connecting points on the circle, such as \( FA, AG, GC, CH, HE, EB, BI, IF \).
  - The lines intersect at the center \( J \) of the circle.

- **Angles:**
  - Angles are labeled at specific points:
    - \( \angle FAG = 110^\circ \) (external angle subtended by arc \( FG \)).
    - \( \angle GCH = 150^\circ \) (external angle subtended by arc \( GH \)).
    - The question asks for \( \angle 5 \), which appears to be the angle subtended by the chord \( AC \) at the center \( J \).

- **Measurements:**
  - Numerical values are provided for external angles:
    - \( \angle FAG = 110^\circ \).
    - \( \angle GCH = 150^\circ \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Circle Properties:**
  - All points \( F, A, G, C, H, E, B, I \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The center of the circle is \( J \).

- **Chords and Central Angles:**
  - The central angle subtended by a chord is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.
  - External angles subtend arcs, and their measures are related to the internal angles.

- **Intersections:**
  - The chords intersect at the center \( J \), forming central angles.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **External Angles:**
  - \( \angle FAG = 110^\circ \): This is the external angle subtended by arc \( FG \).
  - \( \angle GCH = 150^\circ \): This is the external angle subtended by arc \( GH \).

- **Central Angles:**
  - The central angle subtended by an arc is twice the measure of the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.
  - The external angle is related to the internal angles through the circle's properties.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for \( \angle 5 \), which is the central angle subtended by the chord \( AC \) at the center \( J \).
- To find \( \angle 5 \), we need to use the relationships between the external angles and the central angles.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the circle, its points, chords, and angles.
- We must capture the relationships between the external angles and the central angles.
- The predicates should reflect the given measurements and geometric properties without directly solving for \( \angle 5 \).
