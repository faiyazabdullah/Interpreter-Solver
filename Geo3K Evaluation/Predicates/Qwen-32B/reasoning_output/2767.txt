================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a circle with center \( O \).
  - Four points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( AB, BC, CD, \) and \( DA \) form a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Chords \( AB, BC, CD, \) and \( DA \) connect the points on the circumference.
  - Two arcs are labeled with their measures:
    - The arc \( CB \) subtends an angle of \( 65^\circ \).
    - The arc \( BD \) subtends an angle of \( 132^\circ \).
  - An angle \( \angle CEB \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle, the quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is cyclic.
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
  - The sum of the measures of opposite arcs in a cyclic quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The angle \( \angle CEB \) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc \( CD \).
  - The measure of the arc \( CD \) can be found using the total circle measure and the given arc measures.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - Arc \( CB = 65^\circ \).
  - Arc \( BD = 132^\circ \).
  - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - The measure of arc \( CD \) can be calculated as:
    \[
    \text{Arc } CD = 360^\circ - (\text{Arc } CB + \text{Arc } BD + \text{Arc } DA)
    \]
    However, since only two arcs are given, we focus on the inscribed angle \( \angle CEB \) which subtends arc \( CD \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks for the value of \( x \), which is the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle CEB \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
  - Therefore, \( x = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of Arc } CD \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle and its points.
  - Represent the arcs and their measures.
  - Represent the inscribed angle and its relationship to the arc.
  - Ensure all visible relationships and measurements are captured.
