REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - Key points are labeled as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  - Line \(BD\) is a diagonal connecting \(B\) and \(D\).

- **Measurements:**
  - \(AB = 14\)
  - \(BC = 10\)
  - The length of \(CD\) is denoted as \(x\).

- **Special Markings:**
  - There is a right angle symbol at \(\angle ABC\), indicating that \(\angle ABC\) is a right angle.
  - No other specific markings are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \(\triangle ABC\) is a right triangle because \(\angle ABC\) is a right angle.
  - \(AB\) and \(BC\) are the legs of \(\triangle ABC\).
  - \(AC\) is the hypotenuse of \(\triangle ABC\).
  - The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) has one known right angle (\(\angle ABC\)).
  - Since no other angles or relationships are specified, we assume \(ABCD\) is not a special type of quadrilateral beyond what is directly observable.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \(AB = 14\)
  - \(BC = 10\)
  - \(CD = x\) (unknown, to be determined).
  - The length of \(AC\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABC\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - The goal is to find the value of \(x\), the length of side \(CD\).
- **Relevant Information:**
  - The right triangle \(\triangle ABC\) provides a way to calculate \(AC\).
  - The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) does not provide additional constraints beyond the right angle at \(B\).
- **Approach:**
  - Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(AC\).
  - Since no further relationships are given for \(CD\), \(x\) remains directly related to the structure of the quadrilateral without additional constraints.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the quadrilateral and its sides.
  - Define the right triangle \(\triangle ABC\) and its properties.
  - Capture the measurements and relationships between the sides.
  - Ensure all visible information is represented.
