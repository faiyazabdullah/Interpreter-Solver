REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is depicted with center \( J \).
  - Points \( K \) and \( C \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - A line segment \( JK \) is drawn from the center \( J \) to point \( K \), and another line segment \( JC \) is drawn from the center \( J \) to point \( C \).
  - An arc \( \widehat{JK} \) is part of the circle, connecting points \( J \) and \( K \).

- **Labels and Measurements:**
  - The central angle \( \angle JKC \) is labeled as \( 30^\circ \).
  - The radius \( JC \) is labeled as \( 2 \) ft.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional special markings such as right angles or parallel lines are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Points \( K \) and \( C \) lie on the circumference of the circle, so \( JK \) and \( JC \) are radii of the circle.
  - The arc \( \widehat{JK} \) subtends the central angle \( \angle JKC \).
  - The length of the arc \( \widehat{JK} \) depends on the central angle and the radius of the circle.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The circle's radius is given as \( 2 \) ft.
  - The central angle \( \angle JKC \) is \( 30^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Radius \( JC = 2 \) ft.
  - Central angle \( \angle JKC = 30^\circ \).

- **What These Measurements Represent:**
  - The radius \( JC \) is the distance from the center \( J \) to any point on the circumference.
  - The central angle \( \angle JKC \) determines the proportion of the circle's circumference that the arc \( \widehat{JK} \) represents.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The problem requires finding the length of the arc \( \widehat{JK} \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The length of an arc is given by the formula:
    \[
    \text{Arc Length} = 2\pi r \left(\frac{\theta}{360^\circ}\right)
    \]
    where \( r \) is the radius of the circle and \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees.

- **Information Needed:**
  - The radius \( r = 2 \) ft.
  - The central angle \( \theta = 30^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the circle and its properties.
  - Define the points and their relationships to the circle.
  - Specify the radius and the central angle.
  - Ensure all visible information is captured without solving the problem directly.
