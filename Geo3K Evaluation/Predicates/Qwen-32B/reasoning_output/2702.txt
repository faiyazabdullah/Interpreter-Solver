STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2702
================================================================================
QUESTION: In \triangle P Q R, Z Q = 3 a - 11, Z P = a + 5, P Y = 2 c - 1, Y R = 4 c - 11, m \angle P R Z = 4 b - 17, m \angle Z R Q = 3 b - 4, m \angle Q Y R = 7 b + 6, and m \angle P X R = 2 a + 10. If R Z is an angle bisector, find m \angle P R Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image depicts a triangle \( \triangle PQR \).
  - Points labeled: \( P, Q, R, X, Y, Z \).
  - Additional points \( A \) and \( B \) are also present.

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines connecting the points form various segments: \( PQ, QR, RP, PX, QZ, RZ, PY, YR, ZX \).

- **Angles:**
  - Angles are marked at several vertices: \( \angle PRZ, \angle ZRQ, \angle QYR, \angle PXR \).
  - Specific angle measures are given:
    - \( m\angle PRZ = 4b - 17 \)
    - \( m\angle ZRQ = 3b - 4 \)
    - \( m\angle QYR = 7b + 6 \)
    - \( m\angle PXR = 2a + 10 \).

- **Measurements:**
  - Segment lengths are given:
    - \( ZQ = 3a - 11 \)
    - \( ZP = a + 5 \)
    - \( PY = 2c - 1 \)
    - \( YR = 4c - 11 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( RZ \) is explicitly stated to be an angle bisector of \( \angle PRQ \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Triangle Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle PQR \) is the main triangle.
  - \( RZ \) is an angle bisector, so it divides \( \angle PRQ \) into two equal parts.

- **Line Relationships:**
  - \( RZ \) intersects \( PQ \) at point \( Z \).
  - \( PY \) and \( YR \) divide \( PR \) into segments.
  - \( PX \) and \( QZ \) are additional segments within the triangle.

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - Since \( RZ \) is an angle bisector, \( \angle PRZ = \angle ZRQ \).
  - The angles at \( Y \) and \( X \) are related through the interior angles of the triangle.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Segment Lengths:**
  - \( ZQ = 3a - 11 \)
  - \( ZP = a + 5 \)
  - These segments are part of the triangle's internal structure.

  - \( PY = 2c - 1 \)
  - \( YR = 4c - 11 \)
  - These segments divide \( PR \) into parts, suggesting a possible application of the Angle Bisector Theorem if necessary.

- **Angle Measures:**
  - \( m\angle PRZ = 4b - 17 \)
  - \( m\angle ZRQ = 3b - 4 \)
  - Since \( RZ \) is an angle bisector, \( m\angle PRZ = m\angle ZRQ \).

  - \( m\angle QYR = 7b + 6 \)
  - \( m\angle PXR = 2a + 10 \)
  - These angles are interior to the triangle and may be used to establish further relationships.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for \( m\angle PRZ \).
- Given that \( RZ \) is an angle bisector, we know:
  \[
  m\angle PRZ = m\angle ZRQ
  \]
- From the given angle measures:
  \[
  m\angle PRZ = 4b - 17 \quad \text{and} \quad m\angle ZRQ = 3b - 4
  \]
- Setting these equal gives:
  \[
  4b - 17 = 3b - 4
  \]
- Solving for \( b \):
  \[
  4b - 3b = 17 - 4 \implies b = 13
  \]
- Substituting \( b = 13 \) into \( m\angle PRZ = 4b - 17 \):
  \[
  m\angle PRZ = 4(13) - 17 = 52 - 17 = 35
  \]

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will include the triangle, points, lines, angles, angle bisector property, and given measurements.
