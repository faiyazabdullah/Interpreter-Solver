================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present with center \( M \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, T, N \) are on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( TA \) and \( TB \) are tangent to the circle at points \( A \) and \( B \), respectively.
  - Line segments \( AM \) and \( BM \) are radii of the circle.
  - Angles \( \angle TAM \) and \( \angle TBM \) are right angles (marked with squares).
  - Point \( M \) is the center of the circle.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( \angle TBM = 28^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols indicate \( \angle TAM \) and \( \angle TBM \) are right angles.
  - Radii \( AM \) and \( BM \) are congruent.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( TA \) and \( TB \) are tangents to the circle from point \( T \).
  - \( AM \) and \( BM \) are radii of the circle, so \( AM = BM \).
  - Since \( TA \) and \( TB \) are tangents, \( \angle TAM \) and \( \angle TBM \) are right angles (each \( 90^\circ \)).
  - The quadrilateral \( TAMN \) includes the right angles at \( A \) and \( B \).
  - \( \angle CAM \) is part of the inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( CD \).

- **Implied Properties:**
  - The tangents \( TA \) and \( TB \) are equal in length.
  - The radii \( AM \) and \( BM \) are perpendicular to the tangents at the points of tangency.
  - The angle \( \angle CAM \) can be related to the central angle subtended by the same arc.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle TBM = 28^\circ \).
  - \( \angle TAM = 90^\circ \) (right angle).
  - \( \angle TBM = 28^\circ \) implies \( \angle ABM = 28^\circ \) because \( \angle TBM \) is part of the right triangle \( TBM \).

- **Relationship Between Angles:**
  - Since \( \angle TAM = 90^\circ \), the remaining angle in \( \triangle TAM \) is \( 90^\circ - 28^\circ = 62^\circ \).
  - The inscribed angle \( \angle CAM \) is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle CAM \).
- To find \( \angle CAM \), we need to use the properties of the circle and the given angle \( \angle TBM = 28^\circ \).
- The key relationship is that the inscribed angle \( \angle CAM \) is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will include the circle, its center, radii, tangents, angles, and the relationships between them.
- The final goal is to represent the relationships that lead to finding \( \angle CAM \), without directly stating the answer.
