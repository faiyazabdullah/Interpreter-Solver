REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a circle with center \( O \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - A sector of the circle is shaded, bounded by radii \( OA \) and \( OC \) and the arc \( AC \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The radius of the circle is denoted as 6 mm.
  - The central angle subtended by the arc \( AC \) is \( 240^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The shaded region represents a sector of the circle.
  - No additional markings indicate specific geometric constraints beyond those mentioned.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are equidistant from the center \( O \) because they lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The segment \( OA \) and \( OC \) are radii of the circle.
  - The sector \( OAC \) has a central angle of \( 240^\circ \).

- **Implied Properties**:
  - The circle is uniform, and the radius is constant.
  - The sector's area depends on the central angle and the radius.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Radius \( r = 6 \) mm.
  - Central angle \( \theta = 240^\circ \).

- **Measurement Interpretation**:
  - The radius \( r \) is used to calculate the area of the sector.
  - The central angle \( \theta \) determines the fraction of the circle's area that the sector occupies.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**:
  - The problem asks for the area of the shaded sector.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The formula for the area of a sector is:
    \[
    \text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
    \]
  - Here, \( \theta = 240^\circ \) and \( r = 6 \) mm.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the circle and its properties.
  - Specify the points on the circumference.
  - Indicate the central angle and the radius.
  - Represent the sector and its relationship to the circle.
