REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Quadrilateral \(EFGH\) is labeled and appears to be a rectangle.
  - Diagonals \(EG\) and \(FH\) intersect at point \(K\).
  - Lines \(EK\), \(FK\), \(GK\), and \(HK\) are drawn from the vertices of the rectangle to the intersection point \(K\).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The length \(FK\) is given as 32 feet.
  - The rectangle has right angles at each vertex, as indicated by the right-angle symbols at \(H\) and other vertices.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The intersection point \(K\) is marked, indicating it is significant (likely the midpoint of the diagonals).
  - The diagonals \(EG\) and \(FH\) appear to bisect each other.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Rectangle**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(EF = HG\) and \(EH = FG\).
  - Diagonals are equal: \(EG = FH\).
  - Diagonals bisect each other: \(K\) is the midpoint of both \(EG\) and \(FH\).

- **Relationships**:
  - Since \(K\) is the midpoint of \(FH\), \(FK = KH = 32\) feet.
  - Therefore, the full length of \(FH\) is \(FK + KH = 32 + 32 = 64\) feet.
  - Since the diagonals of a rectangle are equal, \(EG = FH = 64\) feet.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**:
  - \(FK = 32\) feet.

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \(K\) is the midpoint of \(FH\), \(KH = FK = 32\) feet.
  - Therefore, \(FH = FK + KH = 32 + 32 = 64\) feet.
  - By the property of rectangles, \(EG = FH = 64\) feet.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \(EG\).
- From the properties of a rectangle, we know that the diagonals are equal. Since \(FH = 64\) feet, it follows that \(EG = 64\) feet.
- The key relationships used are the properties of the rectangle and the fact that the diagonals bisect each other.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will include the definition of the rectangle, the equality of diagonals, the bisection of diagonals, and the given measurement.
