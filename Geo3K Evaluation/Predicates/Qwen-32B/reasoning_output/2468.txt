REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Triangle \( \triangle EGF \) with vertices \( E, G, F \).
  - A right triangle \( \triangle EHG \) formed by dropping an altitude from \( E \) to \( GF \).
  - Points \( G, H, F \) lie on the same horizontal line.
  - Points \( E, G, F \) form the vertices of the larger triangle.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( EG, EF, GF \).
  - Altitude \( EH \) dropped from \( E \) perpendicular to \( GF \).
  - Segments \( GH \) and \( HF \) on the base \( GF \).

- **Angles**:
  - Right angle at \( H \) (marked with a red square).
  - Other angles are not explicitly marked but can be inferred.

- **Measurements**:
  - \( GH = 12 \).
  - \( HF = 16 \).
  - Total base \( GF = GH + HF = 12 + 16 = 28 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( EH \) is the altitude to the hypotenuse \( GF \).
  - \( \triangle EHG \) and \( \triangle EHF \) are smaller right triangles within \( \triangle EGF \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle EGF \) is a right triangle because \( EH \) is perpendicular to \( GF \).
  - \( \triangle EHG \) and \( \triangle EHF \) are also right triangles.
  - \( EH \) is the altitude to the hypotenuse \( GF \).
  - \( GH \) and \( HF \) are segments of the hypotenuse \( GF \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to \( \triangle EGF \).
  - The altitude \( EH \) divides \( \triangle EGF \) into two smaller right triangles similar to \( \triangle EGF \).
  - The geometric mean theorem (or altitude-on-hypotenuse theorem) applies: \( EH^2 = GH \cdot HF \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( GH = 12 \).
  - \( HF = 16 \).
  - \( GF = GH + HF = 12 + 16 = 28 \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The altitude \( EH \) is related to \( GH \) and \( HF \) by the geometric mean theorem.
  - The lengths \( GH \) and \( HF \) are given, so we can use them to find \( EH \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of the altitude \( EH \) drawn to the hypotenuse \( GF \).
- To solve this, we use the geometric mean theorem:
  \[
  EH^2 = GH \cdot HF
  \]
- We need to calculate \( EH \) using the given values of \( GH \) and \( HF \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Define the points, lines, and triangles.
  - Specify the right angles and perpendicular relationships.
- **Predicates for Measurements**:
  - Define the lengths of segments \( GH \), \( HF \), and \( GF \).
- **Predicates for Relationships**:
  - Use the geometric mean theorem to relate \( EH \) to \( GH \) and \( HF \).
