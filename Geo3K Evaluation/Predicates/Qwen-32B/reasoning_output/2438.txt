================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains several triangles and segments.
  - Key points: \( W, R, T, V, S \).
  - Lines connecting these points form triangles and segments.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( WS = 8 \).
  - \( WR = x + 6 \).
  - \( RT = 2x + 6 \).
  - \( VT = 10 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols are present at points \( W, R, T \), and \( V \). This indicates that the triangles involving these points are right triangles.
  - The red dots at \( W, R, T, V \) highlight key vertices.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles:**
  - Triangles \( \triangle WRS \), \( \triangle RTV \), and \( \triangle WRT \) are right triangles.
  - The right-angle symbols confirm perpendicularity at \( W, R, T, \) and \( V \).

- **Parallelism and Perpendicularity:**
  - Line segments \( WR \) and \( RT \) form part of the same straight line, indicating collinearity.
  - The right-angle symbols at \( R, T, \) and \( V \) suggest perpendicular relationships between certain sides.

- **Congruence and Similarity:**
  - No explicit markings indicate congruence or similarity between triangles.
  - However, the right-angle symbols and shared sides suggest potential proportional relationships.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( WS = 8 \).
  - \( WR = x + 6 \).
  - \( RT = 2x + 6 \).
  - \( VT = 10 \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( W, R, T \) are collinear, the total length \( WT \) can be expressed as:
    \[
    WT = WR + RT = (x + 6) + (2x + 6) = 3x + 12.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( WR \).
- From the measurements, \( WR = x + 6 \).
- To find \( WR \), we need to determine the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will capture the shapes, lines, angles, measurements, and relationships without explicitly solving for \( x \).
