QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Lines: \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \).

- **Measurements**:
  - Side \( AB = 13 \).
  - Side \( AC = 22 \).
  - Side \( BC = x \) (the unknown we need to find).

- **Special Markings**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \), indicating \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at vertex \( B \).
  - The sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle, and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Known Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 13 \): One leg of the right triangle.
  - \( AC = 22 \): The hypotenuse of the right triangle.
  - \( BC = x \): The other leg of the right triangle, which we need to find.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), the length of side \( BC \).
- To solve this, we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states:
  \[
  \text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \text{Leg}_1^2 + \text{Leg}_2^2
  \]
  Here, \( AC \) is the hypotenuse, and \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the visible geometric relationships and measurements using the provided predicate format.
- The predicates should capture the triangle structure, the right angle, the side lengths, and the relationship between them without directly solving for \( x \).
