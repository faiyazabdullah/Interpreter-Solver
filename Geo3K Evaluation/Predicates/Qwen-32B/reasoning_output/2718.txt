REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: E, F, G, D
- **Lines**: 
  - Line(E, G) (horizontal line)
  - Line(D, E) (slanted line)
  - Line(D, F) (diagonal line)
  - Line(G, F) (vertical line)
- **Angles**:
  - ∠DEG = 25° (marked explicitly)
  - ∠DGF = 90° (right angle symbol)
  - ∠DFG = 65° (marked explicitly)
  - ∠1 (angle at point D formed by lines DE and DG)
  - ∠2 (angle at point D formed by lines DG and DF)
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbol at ∠DGF indicates it is 90°.
  - No additional parallel or congruence markings are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Line(G, F) is perpendicular to Line(E, G) because ∠DGF is a right angle.
  - Line(DE) and Line(E, G) form an angle of 25° at point E.
  - Line(D, F) and Line(G, F) form an angle of 65° at point F.
  - The sum of angles around point D must satisfy the properties of a triangle (∠1 + ∠2 + 90° = 180°).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - ∠DEG = 25°
  - ∠DGF = 90°
  - ∠DFG = 65°
- These measurements help define the angles in the geometric configuration.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠1.
- To find ∠1, we need to use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180° and the properties of the angles around point D.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will describe the points, lines, angles, and their measures without directly stating the solution.
