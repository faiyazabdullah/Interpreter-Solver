REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Points**: The diagram contains several labeled points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L \).
- **Lines**: Multiple lines are drawn connecting these points. Notable lines include:
  - \( \overline{AB} \), \( \overline{CD} \), \( \overline{EF} \), \( \overline{GH} \), \( \overline{IJ} \), \( \overline{KL} \).
- **Angles**: Several angles are marked and labeled:
  - \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4, \angle 5, \angle 6, \angle 7, \angle 8, \angle 9, \angle 10, \angle 11, \angle 12, \angle 13, \angle 14, \angle 15, \angle 16 \).
- **Measurements**: Specific angle measures are given:
  - \( m\angle 3 = 110^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 12 = 55^\circ \).
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 16 \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - \( \overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD} \) (implied by the consistent orientation and lack of intersection).
  - \( \overline{EF} \parallel \overline{GH} \) (similarly implied).
- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle 11 \) and \( \angle 16 \) are right angles.
- **Corresponding and Alternate Angles**:
  - Since \( \overline{AB} \parallel \overline{CD} \), corresponding and alternate angles are equal.
  - Similarly, for \( \overline{EF} \parallel \overline{GH} \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle 3 = 110^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 12 = 55^\circ \).
- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Using the properties of parallel lines and transversals, we can deduce relationships between other angles.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 13 \).
- To find \( m\angle 13 \), we need to use the relationships between angles formed by parallel lines and transversals, as well as the given angle measures.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the geometric relationships, parallel lines, angles, and given measurements.
- Predicates will capture the structure of the diagram, the parallelism, right angles, and the specific angle measures.
