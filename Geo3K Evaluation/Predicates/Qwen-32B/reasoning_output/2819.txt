QUESTION: Find the area of the rhombus.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure depicts a rhombus \(ABCD\).
  - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are the vertices of the rhombus.
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) are the sides of the rhombus.
  - \(AC\) and \(BD\) are the diagonals of the rhombus.
  - Segment \(DE\) is part of diagonal \(BD\), and segment \(AE\) is part of diagonal \(AC\).

- **Measurements**:
  - The length of diagonal \(BD\) is given as 8 inches.
  - The length of diagonal \(AC\) is given as 17 inches.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at right angles (\(\perp\)).
  - The diagonals bisect each other at point \(E\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rhombus Properties**:
  - All sides of a rhombus are equal in length.
  - Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
  - Diagonals of a rhombus divide it into four congruent right triangles.

- **Relationships**:
  - \(AC \perp BD\).
  - \(E\) is the midpoint of both diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
  - Each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \(BD = 8\) inches.
  - \(AC = 17\) inches.
  - Since the diagonals bisect each other, \(AE = EC = \frac{AC}{2} = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5\) inches.
  - Similarly, \(BE = ED = \frac{BD}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4\) inches.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2
  \]
  where \(d_1\) and \(d_2\) are the lengths of the diagonals.
- From the image, we have \(d_1 = AC = 17\) inches and \(d_2 = BD = 8\) inches.
- Therefore, the area can be computed as:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times 8
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the figure.
- Predicates will capture the shape, relationships between lines and points, and the given measurements.
