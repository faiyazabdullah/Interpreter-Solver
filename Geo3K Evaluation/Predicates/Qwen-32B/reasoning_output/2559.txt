STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2559
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### STEP 1: Image Analysis
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are vertices of the triangle.
  - The right angle is at \( A \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AB \) is one leg of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is the other leg of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \) (indicated by the right angle symbol).

- **Measurements**:
  - The length of \( BC \) is given as \( 8\sqrt{3} \).
  - The length of \( AB \) is denoted as \( x \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle is marked at \( A \).
  - An angle of \( 60^\circ \) is marked at \( C \).

#### STEP 2: Relationship Identification
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \) implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle because the angles are \( 30^\circ \), \( 60^\circ \), and \( 90^\circ \).

- **Implied Properties**:
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides have a specific ratio:
    - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)) is half the hypotenuse (\( AC \)).
    - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle (\( BC \)) is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)).

#### STEP 3: Measurement Analysis
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( BC = 8\sqrt{3} \).
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \).

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle:
    - \( BC = \sqrt{3} \times AB \).
    - Therefore, \( AB = \frac{BC}{\sqrt{3}} \).

#### STEP 4: Question Analysis
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the length of \( AB \).
- To find \( x \), we use the relationship in a 30-60-90 triangle:
  \[
  AB = \frac{BC}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = 8.
  \]

#### STEP 5: Predicate Planning
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The predicates should capture the structure of the triangle, the right angle, the given angle, and the side lengths.
