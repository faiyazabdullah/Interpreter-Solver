REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram contains a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - The quadrilateral appears to have two parallel sides (\(AB \parallel CD\)), suggesting it might be a trapezoid or a parallelogram.

- **Lines**:
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.

- **Angles**:
  - Angles are labeled with measures involving the variable \(x\):
    - \(\angle A = x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle B = 2x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle C = 2x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle D = x^\circ\)

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings such as right angles, congruence symbols, or parallel markers are explicitly shown beyond the angle measures.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelism**:
  - Since the diagram suggests \(AB \parallel CD\) (as indicated by the consistent labeling of angles and the structure), we infer that \(AB\) is parallel to \(CD\).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - The angles \(\angle A\) and \(\angle D\) are equal (\(x^\circ\)), and \(\angle B\) and \(\angle C\) are equal (\(2x^\circ\)).
  - This symmetry suggests that the quadrilateral could be an isosceles trapezoid or a parallelogram.

- **Sum of Interior Angles**:
  - The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is always \(360^\circ\). This will help us solve for \(x\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The angles are expressed in terms of \(x\):
    - \(\angle A = x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle B = 2x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle C = 2x^\circ\)
    - \(\angle D = x^\circ\)

- **Relationships**:
  - Using the property that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\):
    \[
    \angle A + \angle B + \angle C + \angle D = 360^\circ
    \]
    Substituting the given expressions:
    \[
    x + 2x + 2x + x = 360^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle B\).
- To find \(\angle B\), we need to determine the value of \(x\) first using the sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral.
- Once \(x\) is found, we can calculate \(\angle B = 2x^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates will include the quadrilateral, its sides, angles, and the relationships between them.
- We will not include the final answer or derived solutions, only the given information and constraints.
