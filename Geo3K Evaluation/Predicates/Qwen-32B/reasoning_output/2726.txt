STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2726
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two triangles are present: \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - Points labeled: \( L, M, N, X, Y, Z \).

- **Lines:**
  - Lines forming the sides of the triangles: \( LM, LN, MN, XY, XZ, YZ \).

- **Angles:**
  - Angles labeled: \( \angle MLN = 65^\circ \), \( \angle LMN = 51^\circ \).
  - One angle in \( \triangle XYZ \) is labeled as \( (4x)^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle MLN \) in \( \triangle LMN \).
  - Congruency markings indicate that \( \triangle LMN \) and \( \triangle XYZ \) have corresponding congruent sides and angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle LMN \) is a right triangle with \( \angle MLN \) as the right angle.
  - \( \triangle XYZ \) appears to be an isosceles triangle with \( XY = YZ \) due to the congruency markings.
  - The angle \( (4x)^\circ \) in \( \triangle XYZ \) corresponds to one of the base angles of the isosceles triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle MLN = 65^\circ \).
  - \( \angle LMN = 51^\circ \).
  - \( \angle XYZ = (4x)^\circ \).

- **Implications:**
  - In \( \triangle LMN \), since it is a right triangle, the sum of the angles must be \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can calculate the third angle \( \angle LNM \).
  - In \( \triangle XYZ \), since it is isosceles, the base angles are equal, and the sum of the angles must also be \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we need to determine the measure of the angle \( (4x)^\circ \) in \( \triangle XYZ \). This requires analyzing the properties of both triangles and using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Ensure all visible information is captured, including angle measures, triangle types, and congruency markings.
