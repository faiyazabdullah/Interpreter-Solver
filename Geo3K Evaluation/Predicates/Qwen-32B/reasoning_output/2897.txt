REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( J \), \( K \), \( L \), and \( M \).
  - The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram based on its structure.
  
- **Lines and Angles**:
  - The sides are labeled as lines connecting the vertices: \( JK \), \( KL \), \( LM \), and \( MJ \).
  - Angles are marked at specific vertices:
    - \( \angle JMK = 105^\circ \)
    - \( \angle JKM = 75^\circ \)
    - \( \angle KLM = (2x - 1)^\circ \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - The quadrilateral has parallel sides indicated by the structure, suggesting it is a parallelogram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Since the figure is a parallelogram:
    - Opposite sides are parallel: \( JK \parallel ML \) and \( JM \parallel KL \).
    - Opposite angles are equal.
    - Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary.
  - Given angles at vertices \( J \) and \( M \), we can use these properties to find the unknown angle at vertex \( L \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( \angle JKM = 75^\circ \)
  - \( \angle JMK = 105^\circ \)
  - \( \angle KLM = (2x - 1)^\circ \)

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - Since \( JK \parallel ML \), the angle \( \angle JKM \) and \( \angle KLM \) are consecutive angles along the transversal \( KM \). Therefore, they are supplementary:
    \[
    \angle JKM + \angle KLM = 180^\circ
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    75^\circ + (2x - 1)^\circ = 180^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \) in the given parallelogram.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The property of supplementary angles in a parallelogram is key here.
  - We need to solve the equation derived from the supplementary angle relationship.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the parallelogram and its properties.
  - Capture the given angle measurements and their relationships.
  - Ensure all visible information is included without directly solving for \( x \).
