================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
- \( \angle C \) is marked as a right angle (\(\perp\)).
- The side opposite to \( \angle C \) is labeled \( x \), which is the hypotenuse.
- The side adjacent to \( \angle C \) and opposite to \( \angle B \) is labeled as 24 units.
- The side adjacent to \( \angle C \) and adjacent to \( \angle B \) is labeled as \( y \).
- The angle \( \angle B \) is marked as \( 30^\circ \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle because \( \angle C \) is a right angle.
- \( x \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( \angle B \)) is half the length of the hypotenuse in a 30-60-90 triangle.
- The side adjacent to the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( y \)) is the longer leg in the 30-60-90 triangle.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( \angle B \)) is given as 24 units.
- In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle is half the hypotenuse. Therefore, \( x = 2 \times 24 = 48 \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- To find \( x \), we use the property of the 30-60-90 triangle where the hypotenuse is twice the length of the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the triangle, its angles, sides, and the relationships between them.
- The key relationships are:
  1. \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.
  2. \( \angle C \) is a right angle.
  3. \( \angle B = 30^\circ \).
  4. The side opposite \( \angle B \) is 24 units.
  5. The hypotenuse \( x \) is twice the length of the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.
