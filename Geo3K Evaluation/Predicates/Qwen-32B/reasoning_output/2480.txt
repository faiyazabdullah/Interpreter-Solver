REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image contains multiple triangles and quadrilaterals.
  - Key points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \).
  - Lines connecting these points form various shapes.

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - Line segments are labeled with specific lengths: \( AB, CD, EF \), etc.
  - Specific lengths are given for some sides: \( AB = 3 \), \( CD = 4 \).

- **Angles**:
  - Angles are explicitly labeled at various vertices:
    - \( \angle EAB = 25^\circ \)
    - \( \angle CAB = 51^\circ \)
    - \( \angle CFD = 35^\circ \)
    - \( \angle DBF = 28^\circ \)
  - Right angles are marked at points \( G \) and \( F \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols at points \( G \) and \( F \) indicate perpendicularity.
  - No parallel or congruence marks are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle ABE \): Formed by points \( A, B, E \).
  - \( \triangle ABC \): Formed by points \( A, B, C \).
  - \( \triangle CFD \): Formed by points \( C, F, D \).
  - \( \triangle BFD \): Formed by points \( B, F, D \).

- **Quadrilateral**:
  - \( ABCD \): A quadrilateral formed by points \( A, B, C, D \).

- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle AGC = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle CFD = 90^\circ \) are right angles.

- **Perpendicularity**:
  - Line \( CG \) is perpendicular to line \( AB \).
  - Line \( CF \) is perpendicular to line \( BD \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Explicit Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 3 \)
  - \( CD = 4 \)
  - Angles: \( \angle EAB = 25^\circ \), \( \angle CAB = 51^\circ \), \( \angle CFD = 35^\circ \), \( \angle DBF = 28^\circ \).

- **Derived Information**:
  - Since \( \angle AGC = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle AGC \) is a right triangle.
  - Since \( \angle CFD = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle CFD \) is a right triangle.
  - The sum of angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \angle 6 \), where \( \angle 6 \) is the angle at point \( B \) in \( \triangle BFD \).
- To find \( m \angle 6 \), we need to use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  m \angle 6 = 180^\circ - (\angle DBF + \angle CFD).
  \]
- Given \( \angle DBF = 28^\circ \) and \( \angle CFD = 35^\circ \), we can calculate:
  \[
  m \angle 6 = 180^\circ - (28^\circ + 35^\circ) = 180^\circ - 63^\circ = 117^\circ.
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates should capture the shapes, angles, right angles, and measurements.
