REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( W, X, Y, Z \).
  - The quadrilateral is not explicitly labeled as any specific type (e.g., rectangle, parallelogram).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - The sides of the quadrilateral are labeled as follows:
    - \( WX \) (side connecting \( W \) and \( X \))
    - \( XY \) (side connecting \( X \) and \( Y \))
    - \( YZ \) (side connecting \( Y \) and \( Z \))
    - \( ZW \) (side connecting \( Z \) and \( W \))

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - The measure of \( \angle W \) is labeled as \( a \).
  - The measure of \( \angle X \) is labeled as \( \frac{1}{2}a + 8 \).
  - The measure of \( \angle Y \) is labeled as \( a - 28 \).
  - The measure of \( \angle Z \) is labeled as \( a + 22 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - There are no special markings indicating parallel lines, perpendicular lines, or congruent angles/sides.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is always \( 360^\circ \). This is a fundamental property we will use.
  - No additional relationships (such as parallelism or congruence) are explicitly indicated in the diagram.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - The measures of the angles are given in terms of \( a \):
    - \( \angle W = a \)
    - \( \angle X = \frac{1}{2}a + 8 \)
    - \( \angle Y = a - 28 \)
    - \( \angle Z = a + 22 \)

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - These angle measures are related through the equation for the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral:
    \[
    \angle W + \angle X + \angle Y + \angle Z = 360^\circ
    \]
  - Substituting the expressions for the angles:
    \[
    a + \left(\frac{1}{2}a + 8\right) + (a - 28) + (a + 22) = 360
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle Z \), denoted as \( m \angle Z \).

- **Relevant Information:**
  - The measure of \( \angle Z \) is given as \( a + 22 \).
  - To find \( m \angle Z \), we need to determine the value of \( a \) using the sum of the interior angles of the quadrilateral.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the quadrilateral and its vertices.
  - Define the angles and their measures.
  - Capture the relationship that the sum of the interior angles equals \( 360^\circ \).
  - Avoid directly solving for \( a \) or \( m \angle Z \); instead, represent the relationships and measurements.
