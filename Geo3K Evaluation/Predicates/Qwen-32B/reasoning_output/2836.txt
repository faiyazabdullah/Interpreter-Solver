================================================================================
QUESTION: Circles G, J, and K all intersect at L. If G H = 10, find the measure. Find J L.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Three circles are present: Circle(G), Circle(J), and Circle(K).
  - Points labeled: A, B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L.
  - Lines connecting points form segments and arcs within the circles.
  
- **Visible Measurements and Annotations:**
  - The segment \( GH \) is labeled with a length of 10 units.
  - The circles intersect at point \( L \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruent segments are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Intersections:**
  - Circles \( G \), \( J \), and \( K \) all intersect at point \( L \). This implies \( L \) is a common point on all three circles.
  
- **Relationships Between Elements:**
  - Circle \( G \) has a diameter \( GH \) with length 10.
  - Circle \( J \) and Circle \( K \) share point \( L \) as a common intersection point.
  - No other explicit relationships (like tangency or perpendicularity) are visible.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( GH = 10 \): The diameter of Circle \( G \) is given.
  
- **Implications:**
  - Since \( GH \) is the diameter of Circle \( G \), the radius of Circle \( G \) is \( \frac{GH}{2} = 5 \).
  - The radius of Circle \( G \) is the distance from \( G \) to \( L \) because \( L \) lies on Circle \( G \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the measure of \( JL \), where \( J \) is the center of Circle \( J \) and \( L \) is a point on Circle \( J \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - \( L \) is a point on Circle \( J \), so \( JL \) is the radius of Circle \( J \).
  - Since no additional information about the size of Circle \( J \) is given, we assume \( JL \) is equal to the radius of Circle \( J \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Capture Relationships:**
  - Define the circles and their centers.
  - Indicate that \( L \) is a point on all three circles.
  - Specify the diameter and radius of Circle \( G \).
  - Establish that \( JL \) is the radius of Circle \( J \).
