================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle R S T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The image shows a triangle labeled \( \triangle RST \).
- **Points**: The vertices of the triangle are labeled \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the triangle are \( RS \), \( RT \), and \( ST \).
- **Angles**: The angle at vertex \( R \) is explicitly labeled as \( 70^\circ \).
- **Special Markings**: The sides \( RS \) and \( RT \) have small pink markings indicating they are congruent (equal in length). This means \( \triangle RST \) is an isosceles triangle with \( RS = RT \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruent Sides**: The markings on \( RS \) and \( RT \) indicate that \( RS \cong RT \), making \( \triangle RST \) an isosceles triangle.
- **Angle Properties**: In an isosceles triangle, the base angles opposite the congruent sides are equal. Therefore, \( \angle RST = \angle RTS \).
- **Sum of Angles in a Triangle**: The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**: \( \angle R = 70^\circ \).
- **Derived Information**: Since \( \triangle RST \) is isosceles with \( RS = RT \), the base angles \( \angle RST \) and \( \angle RTS \) are equal. Let \( \angle RST = \angle RTS = x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle RST \), which is one of the base angles of the isosceles triangle.
- To find \( m\angle RST \), we use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle R + \angle RST + \angle RTS = 180^\circ
  \]
  Since \( \angle RST = \angle RTS \), we can write:
  \[
  70^\circ + x + x = 180^\circ
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  70^\circ + 2x = 180^\circ \implies 2x = 110^\circ \implies x = 55^\circ
  \]
  Therefore, \( m\angle RST = 55^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The key relationships to capture are:
  1. The triangle \( \triangle RST \) exists.
  2. The sides \( RS \) and \( RT \) are congruent.
  3. The angle \( \angle R \) is \( 70^\circ \).
  4. The triangle is isosceles due to the congruent sides.
