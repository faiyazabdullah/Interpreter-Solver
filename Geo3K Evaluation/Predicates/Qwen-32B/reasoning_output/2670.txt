REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure contains a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - There is a point \(E\) inside the quadrilateral where diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).

- **Angles**:
  - Angle \( \angle 2 \) is formed at vertex \(A\) between lines \(AB\) and \(AE\).
  - Angle \( \angle 3 \) is formed at vertex \(D\) between lines \(CD\) and \(DE\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \(A\), indicating \( \angle BAD = 90^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \(m \angle 2 = 40^\circ\).
  - Various segment lengths are labeled: \(AB = 2\), \(BC = 7\), \(CD = 3\), \(DA = 6\), \(AE = 1\), \(EC = 7\), \(BE = 6\), \(ED = 4\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Quadrilateral Properties**:
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle because it has one right angle (\(\angle BAD = 90^\circ\)) and opposite sides are equal (implied by the symmetry and labeling).

- **Diagonals**:
  - In a rectangle, diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.
  - Therefore, \(AC = BD\) and \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, all internal angles are \(90^\circ\).
  - The diagonals divide the rectangle into four right triangles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(m \angle 2 = 40^\circ\).
  - Segment lengths: \(AB = 2\), \(BC = 7\), \(CD = 3\), \(DA = 6\), \(AE = 1\), \(EC = 7\), \(BE = 6\), \(ED = 4\).

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, \(AC = BD\).
  - The diagonals bisect each other, so \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m \angle 3\), the measure of the angle at vertex \(D\) between lines \(CD\) and \(DE\).
- To find \(m \angle 3\), we need to use the properties of the rectangle and the fact that the diagonals bisect each other.
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, all internal angles are \(90^\circ\). The diagonals divide the rectangle into four right triangles, and the angles at the intersection of the diagonals are related by symmetry.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships, including the rectangle, right angles, diagonal properties, and angle measurements.
- The predicates should capture the structure of the rectangle, the bisected diagonals, and the given angle measurement.
