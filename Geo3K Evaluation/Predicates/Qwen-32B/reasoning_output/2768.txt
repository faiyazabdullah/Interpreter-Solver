STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2768
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60. Find the measure of \angle 4.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains multiple labeled points such as \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, W \).
- **Lines**: Several lines are drawn, including parallel lines and intersecting lines. Notable lines are labeled \( j, k, l, m, n, p, q \).
- **Angles**: Specific angles are marked with numerical identifiers (e.g., \( \angle 1, \angle 3, \angle 4, \angle 6, \angle 7 \)).
- **Special Markings**: 
  - Parallel lines are indicated by arrowheads (e.g., \( j \parallel k \), \( p \parallel q \)).
  - Corresponding angles are highlighted with pink and blue regions, indicating congruence or relationships.
- **Measurements**: 
  - \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \)
- **Shapes**: The diagram includes triangles, parallelograms, and other geometric figures formed by the intersections and parallel lines.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - \( j \parallel k \)
  - \( p \parallel q \)
- **Intersecting Lines**:
  - Lines \( j \) and \( p \) intersect at point \( A \).
  - Lines \( k \) and \( q \) intersect at point \( T \).
  - Other lines intersect at various points, forming angles and triangles.
- **Corresponding Angles**:
  - Since \( j \parallel k \) and \( p \parallel q \), corresponding angles are equal.
  - For example, \( \angle 1 \) corresponds to \( \angle 4 \) because they are alternate interior angles.
- **Congruent Angles**:
  - Angles marked with the same color (pink or blue) are congruent.
  - For example, \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 4 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \)
- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \( j \parallel k \) and \( p \parallel q \), corresponding angles are equal. Therefore, \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 4 \).
  - This implies \( m\angle 4 = m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 4 \).
- From the analysis, we know that \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are corresponding angles due to the parallel lines \( j \parallel k \) and \( p \parallel q \).
- Therefore, \( m\angle 4 = m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships, including parallel lines, corresponding angles, and the given angle measures.
- Predicates should capture the relationships between parallel lines, corresponding angles, and the equality of angles.
