REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a circle with center \( O \) (implied but not explicitly shown).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F', G' \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Line segments \( AB, BC, CD, DA \) form a quadrilateral \( ABCD \) inscribed in the circle.
  - Additional points \( F', G' \) are marked along the chords and arcs.
  
- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - \( m\widehat{BC} = 30^\circ \): The measure of the arc \( BC \) is 30 degrees.
  - \( m\widehat{AD} = 20^\circ \): The measure of the arc \( AD \) is 20 degrees.
  - Angles at \( A \) and \( C \) are marked as 20째 and 30째 respectively.
  - Chords and arcs are connected, forming central and inscribed angles.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles are marked at points where lines intersect, indicating perpendicularity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is inscribed in the circle, meaning its vertices lie on the circumference.
  - Arcs \( \widehat{BC} \) and \( \widehat{AD} \) are parts of the circle, with their measures given.
  - Angles formed by chords and tangents will use circle theorems, such as the inscribed angle theorem.
  - The angle \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( \widehat{BD} \).

- **Implied Properties**:
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.
  - Since \( \angle 2 \) subtends \( \widehat{BD} \), we need to find \( m\widehat{BD} \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( m\widehat{BC} = 30^\circ \)
  - \( m\widehat{AD} = 20^\circ \)
  - Angles at \( A \) and \( C \) are marked as 20째 and 30째, respectively, but these are not directly related to the calculation of \( \angle 2 \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - To find \( m\angle 2 \), we need \( m\widehat{BD} \). Since \( \widehat{BD} \) is part of the circle, we use the fact that the total circumference is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 2 \).
- From the image, \( \angle 2 \) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc \( \widehat{BD} \).
- Using the inscribed angle theorem, \( m\angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} m\widehat{BD} \).
- To find \( m\widehat{BD} \), we need to determine the remaining arc measures in the circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, and arcs.
- Use the given arc measures to derive the measure of \( \widehat{BD} \).
- Ensure all relationships and measurements are captured in atomic predicates.
