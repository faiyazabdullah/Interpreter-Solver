REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is centered at point \( B \).
  - Points \( A \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), \( F \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( AB \) is a vertical line segment passing through the center \( B \).
  - \( CE \) is a horizontal line segment passing through the center \( B \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( AB \): A vertical line segment.
  - \( CE \): A horizontal line segment.
  - \( CD \) and \( DE \): Segments forming the horizontal diameter.
  - \( BD \): A vertical line segment from the center \( B \) to the circumference at \( D \).

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( AB = 8 \) (vertical distance from \( A \) to \( B \)).
  - \( CE = 13.5 \) (horizontal diameter of the circle).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle CBD \), indicating \( BD \perp CE \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( AB \) is a radius of the circle because it connects the center \( B \) to the circumference at \( A \).
  - \( CE \) is a diameter of the circle because it passes through the center \( B \) and connects two points on the circumference (\( C \) and \( E \)).
  - \( BD \) is a radius of the circle because it connects the center \( B \) to the circumference at \( D \).
  - Since \( BD \perp CE \), \( BD \) is perpendicular to the diameter \( CE \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 8 \): The length of one radius of the circle.
  - \( CE = 13.5 \): The length of the diameter of the circle.

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The radius \( r \) of the circle is half of the diameter \( CE \):
    \[
    r = \frac{CE}{2} = \frac{13.5}{2} = 6.75
    \]
  - Since \( BD \) is also a radius of the circle, \( BD = r = 6.75 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BD \).
- From the analysis, \( BD \) is a radius of the circle.
- The radius can be calculated from the given diameter \( CE = 13.5 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will capture the structure of the circle, the relationships between points, lines, and segments, and the given measurements.
