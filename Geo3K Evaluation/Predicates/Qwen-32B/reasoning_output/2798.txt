================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region. Assume that the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a large triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Inside \( \triangle ABC \), there is a smaller pentagon \( FGECB \) with vertices \( F \), \( G \), \( E \), \( C \), and \( B \).
  - A circle is inscribed in the pentagon \( FGECB \), touching all its sides.
  - The shaded region is the area outside the pentagon \( FGECB \) but inside \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - The sides of \( \triangle ABC \) are \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \).
  - The sides of the pentagon \( FGECB \) are \( FG \), \( GE \), \( EC \), \( CB \), and \( BF \).
  - The circle is tangent to all sides of the pentagon.

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - The side \( AB \) of \( \triangle ABC \) is labeled as 84 units.
  - No other explicit side lengths or angles are provided for \( \triangle ABC \) or the pentagon.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The pentagon appears to be irregular since no symmetry or equal-length markings are visible.
  - The circle is inscribed, indicating tangency to all sides of the pentagon.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Shapes:**
  - The pentagon \( FGECB \) is inscribed within \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The circle is inscribed within the pentagon \( FGECB \), touching all its sides.
  - The shaded region is the area of \( \triangle ABC \) minus the area of the pentagon \( FGECB \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The pentagon is tangential to the circle, meaning the circle's radius is the inradius of the pentagon.
  - The area of the shaded region depends on the areas of \( \triangle ABC \) and the pentagon \( FGECB \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Explicit Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 84 \) units.
  - No other side lengths or angles are explicitly given for \( \triangle ABC \) or the pentagon.

- **Implicit Measurements:**
  - To find the area of the shaded region, we need:
    1. The area of \( \triangle ABC \).
    2. The area of the pentagon \( FGECB \).
  - Since no additional dimensions are provided, we assume \( \triangle ABC \) is a scalene triangle, and the pentagon is irregular.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- The shaded region is the difference between the area of \( \triangle ABC \) and the area of the pentagon \( FGECB \).
- To solve this, we need:
  1. The area of \( \triangle ABC \).
  2. The area of the pentagon \( FGECB \).
- However, without additional information (such as the coordinates of points, angles, or side lengths of the pentagon), we cannot compute these areas directly.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will focus on the shapes, their relationships, and the inscribed circle.
