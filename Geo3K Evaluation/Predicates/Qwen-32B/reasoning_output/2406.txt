STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2406
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of x in the diagram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram contains a quadrilateral \( EFGJ \).
  - Triangles \( \triangle EOD \), \( \triangle COE \), and \( \triangle JGI \) are part of the larger structure.
  - The quadrilateral has vertices labeled \( E, F, G, J \).
  - Additional points \( O, C, I, D \) are marked within the quadrilateral.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines connect the vertices and internal points, such as \( EO, OC, CI, IG, JD, DF \).

- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - Angles are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( \angle EOD = 79^\circ \)
    - \( \angle COE = (x + 10)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle JIG = 2x^\circ \)
    - \( \angle FOB = (x - 1)^\circ \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - No explicit markings for parallel lines, right angles, or congruence.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements**:
  - \( \triangle EOD \), \( \triangle COE \), and \( \triangle JGI \) share common sides and angles.
  - The angles around point \( O \) form a linear pair or supplementary angles since they lie on a straight line.
  - Similarly, angles around point \( I \) and other internal points may also have relationships based on the quadrilateral's properties.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The angles \( \angle EOD \), \( \angle COE \), and others contribute to this total.
  - The quadrilateral's internal angles and external angles must satisfy the properties of a quadrilateral.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Expressions**:
  - \( \angle EOD = 79^\circ \) (constant).
  - \( \angle COE = (x + 10)^\circ \) (variable).
  - \( \angle JIG = 2x^\circ \) (variable).
  - \( \angle FOB = (x - 1)^\circ \) (variable).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The angles around point \( O \) must sum to \( 360^\circ \).
  - The angles around point \( I \) and other internal points will help in setting up equations involving \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - Find the value of \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The sum of angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The relationships between the given angles (involving \( x \)) will provide equations to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the geometric shapes and points.
  - Specify the angles and their measures.
  - Capture the relationships between angles around specific points.
  - Ensure all visible information is represented.
