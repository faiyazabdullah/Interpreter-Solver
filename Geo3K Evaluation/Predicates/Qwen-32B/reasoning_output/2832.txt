================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements**:
  - The image shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with diagonals intersecting at point \(G\).
  - Angles are labeled at vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\):
    - \(\angle BAD = 42^\circ\)
    - \(\angle ABC = 72^\circ\)
    - \(\angle BCD = 38^\circ\)
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(G\), dividing the quadrilateral into four triangles.
  - The interior angles at intersection point \(G\) are labeled as \(1\), \(2\), and \(3\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No explicit markings for parallel lines, perpendicular lines, or congruent segments are visible.
  - The focus is on the angles formed by the diagonals and the vertices of the quadrilateral.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(G\), creating four smaller triangles within the quadrilateral.
  - The sum of the interior angles around point \(G\) is \(360^\circ\).
  - The angles at vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\) are given, and they influence the angles formed by the diagonals.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \(\angle BAD = 42^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ABC = 72^\circ\)
  - \(\angle BCD = 38^\circ\)
  - The remaining angle \(\angle CDA\) can be calculated using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \(360^\circ\):
    \[
    \angle CDA = 360^\circ - (\angle BAD + \angle ABC + \angle BCD) = 360^\circ - (42^\circ + 72^\circ + 38^\circ) = 208^\circ.
    \]

- **Relevant Measurements**:
  - The angles around point \(G\) are related through the properties of the quadrilateral and the diagonals.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**:
  - Find the measure of \(\angle 3\), which is one of the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals at point \(G\).
- **Relevant Properties**:
  - The sum of the angles around point \(G\) is \(360^\circ\).
  - The angles formed by the diagonals are influenced by the angles of the quadrilateral at the vertices.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the quadrilateral, its vertices, and the diagonals.
  - Define the angles at the vertices and the intersection point.
  - Capture the relationship that the sum of the angles around point \(G\) is \(360^\circ\).
