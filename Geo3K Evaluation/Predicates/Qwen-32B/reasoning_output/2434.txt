### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The image contains labeled points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, P, Q, R, S, T \).
- **Lines**: 
  - Horizontal lines: \( PQ \), \( AB \), \( ST \).
  - Vertical segments connecting corresponding points: \( AP \), \( AQ \), \( BS \), \( BT \), etc.
- **Measurements**:
  - \( RS = 54 \).
  - \( QT = 86 \).
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols are present at \( A \), \( B \), and \( T \), indicating that \( \angle PAQ \), \( \angle ABS \), and \( \angle BTQ \) are right angles.
  - Parallel lines are indicated by the double hash marks (\#) on \( PQ \parallel AB \parallel ST \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - \( PQ \parallel AB \parallel ST \) (implied by the double hash marks).
- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle PAQ \), \( \angle ABS \), and \( \angle BTQ \) are right angles.
- **Rectangles**:
  - The configuration suggests rectangles formed by the horizontal and vertical lines, such as \( PABR \), \( ABST \), and \( QABT \).
- **Median**:
  - The question mentions \( GH \) as the median of quadrilateral \( RSBA \). Since \( G \) and \( H \) are midpoints, \( GH \) will be the line segment joining the midpoints of opposite sides of the quadrilateral \( RSBA \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( RS = 54 \).
  - \( QT = 86 \).
- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \( PQ \parallel AB \parallel ST \), the vertical distances between the lines are consistent, implying that the quadrilateral \( RSBA \) is a trapezoid with \( RS \) and \( AB \) as parallel bases.
  - The length of \( AB \) is equal to the length of \( RS \) because they are parallel and part of the same rectangle structure. Thus, \( AB = 54 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( GH \), where \( G \) and \( H \) are the midpoints of \( RB \) and \( SA \), respectively.
- In a trapezoid, the line segment joining the midpoints of the non-parallel sides (the median) is equal to the average of the lengths of the two parallel bases.
- Here, the parallel bases are \( RS \) and \( AB \), both of which have a length of 54. Therefore, the median \( GH \) will also have a length of 54.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the parallelism, right angles, lengths, and the definition of the median.
