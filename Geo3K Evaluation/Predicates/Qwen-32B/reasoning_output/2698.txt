REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a circle with center \( X \).
  - There are four points on the circumference of the circle: \( T \), \( W \), \( Y \), and an unlabeled point.
  - Lines \( TX \), \( WX \), and \( YX \) are radii of the circle.
  - Chords \( TW \) and \( WY \) are shown, with measurements given for their lengths.

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - The length of chord \( TW \) is labeled as \( 4x \).
  - The length of chord \( WY \) is labeled as \( 2x + 10 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The chords \( TW \) and \( WY \) are marked as congruent (\( WT \cong TW \)).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since \( TW \cong WY \), the lengths of the chords \( TW \) and \( WY \) are equal.
  - Both \( TW \) and \( WY \) are chords of the same circle, and their equality implies symmetry in the circle's geometry.
  - The center \( X \) is equidistant from all points on the circumference, so the radii \( TX \), \( WX \), and \( YX \) are all equal.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - Length of \( TW = 4x \).
  - Length of \( WY = 2x + 10 \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( TW \cong WY \), we have \( 4x = 2x + 10 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Question:** Solve for \( x \) given that \( WT \cong TW \), which implies \( TW = WY \).
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The equality of the chords \( TW \) and \( WY \) provides a direct equation to solve for \( x \).
  - No additional geometric properties are needed beyond the equality of the chords.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, its center, and the points on the circumference.
  - Define the chords and their lengths.
  - Capture the congruence relationship between the chords.
  - Ensure all visible information is represented atomically.
