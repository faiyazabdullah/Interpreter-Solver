================================================================================
QUESTION: Find a, if F G = 18, G H = 42, and F K = 15.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a circle with center \( K \).
  - Points \( F, G, H, J \) are marked on the circumference of the circle.
  - Points \( F, G, H \) lie on a straight line passing through the circle, forming a secant.
  - Point \( K \) is the center of the circle, and \( KJ \) is a radius.
  - Line segments \( FG \), \( GH \), and \( FK \) are labeled with specific lengths.
  - The variable \( a \) represents the length of segment \( KJ \).

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations:**
  - \( FG = 18 \)
  - \( GH = 42 \)
  - \( FK = 15 \)
  - \( a \) is the length of \( KJ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No special markings (like right angles, parallel lines, or congruence) are explicitly indicated, except for the circular arc and its center.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( F, G, H \) lie on a straight line, making \( FH \) a secant of the circle.
  - \( K \) is the center of the circle, so \( KJ \) is a radius.
  - Since \( FG \) and \( GH \) are parts of the secant \( FH \), we can use the Power of a Point theorem to relate the lengths.
  - The radius \( KJ \) is perpendicular to the tangent at \( J \) (if extended), but no tangents are explicitly shown here.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( FG = 18 \)
  - \( GH = 42 \)
  - \( FK = 15 \)
  - \( a = KJ \) (to be determined).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The total length of the secant segment \( FH \) is \( FG + GH = 18 + 42 = 60 \).
  - The point \( K \) is the center, and \( FK \) is part of the secant, so we can use the Power of a Point theorem to find \( a \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What is Asked:**
  - Find the value of \( a \), which is the length of the radius \( KJ \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The Power of a Point theorem states that for a secant intersecting a circle at points \( F \) and \( H \), and a point \( K \) inside the circle, the following relationship holds:
    \[
    FK \cdot KH = (KJ)^2 - r^2
    \]
    where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

- **Information Needed:**
  - The lengths \( FG \), \( GH \), and \( FK \) are given.
  - We need to use these to find the radius \( a = KJ \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the circle, its center, and points on its circumference.
  - Define the secant line and its segments.
  - Use the Power of a Point theorem to relate the given lengths.
  - Ensure all geometric relationships and measurements are captured.
