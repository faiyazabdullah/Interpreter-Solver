================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral A B D C is a rectangle. If m \angle 1 = 38, find m \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Quadrilateral \(ABDC\) is labeled as a rectangle.
  - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(G\) are identified.
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(G\).
  - Lines \(AG\), \(GC\), \(BG\), and \(GD\) are also shown.

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1 \), \( \angle 2 \), etc.
  - Specific angle measures are given: \( m\angle 1 = 38^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle ADC \), confirming that \(ABDC\) is a rectangle.
  - No additional congruence or parallel markings are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of Rectangle \(ABDC\):**
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel: \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\).
  - All interior angles are right angles: \( \angle ABC = \angle BCD = \angle CDA = \angle DAB = 90^\circ \).
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are equal in length and bisect each other.

- **Intersecting Diagonals:**
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(G\), which is the midpoint of both diagonals.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( m\angle 1 = 38^\circ \).

- **Inferred Measurements:**
  - Since \(ABDC\) is a rectangle, the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are congruent and bisect each other.
  - The intersection point \(G\) divides each diagonal into two equal segments.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle 2 \).
- From the diagram, \( \angle 2 \) is adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) and they form a linear pair because they lie on the same straight line \(AC\).
- The sum of angles in a linear pair is \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we can use this property to find \( m\angle 2 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle, its diagonals, and the intersecting point.
- Capture the given angle measure and the linear pair relationship.
- Ensure all geometric relationships and constraints are included.
