REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: A, B, C, J, K, L, M.
- **Lines**: 
  - Line(K, B) is horizontal.
  - Line(K, A) intersects Line(K, B) at point K.
  - Line(L, C) intersects Line(K, B) at point M.
  - Line(J, L) is perpendicular to Line(K, B).
  - Line(K, J) intersects Line(K, B) at point K.
- **Angles**:
  - ∠JKL is labeled as 37°.
  - Right angles are marked at points J and M, indicating perpendicularity.
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols at points J and M indicate that Line(J, L) ⊥ Line(K, B) and Line(L, M) ⊥ Line(K, B).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Perpendicular Relationships**:
  - Line(J, L) is perpendicular to Line(K, B).
  - Line(L, M) is perpendicular to Line(K, B).
- **Parallel Relationships**:
  - Line(J, L) is parallel to Line(L, M) because both are perpendicular to the same line (Line(K, B)).
- **Angle Relationships**:
  - ∠JKL is given as 37°.
  - Since Line(J, L) ⊥ Line(K, B), ∠JKL is part of a right triangle formed by Line(K, J), Line(K, L), and Line(J, L).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The only numerical measurement given is ∠JKL = 37°.
- No lengths or additional numerical values are provided for sides or other angles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠JKL.
- From the image, ∠JKL is explicitly labeled as 37°.
- No further calculations or derivations are needed since the angle is directly given.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the geometric shapes, points, lines, and angles.
- Capture the perpendicular and parallel relationships.
- Include the given angle measurement (∠JKL = 37°).
