STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2450
================================================================================
QUESTION: A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix, on to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a triangle with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The triangle is formed by connecting points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - The sides of the triangle are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( AB = 150x + 91 \) (distance from Phoenix to Atlanta).
    - \( BC = 110x + 53 \) (distance from Des Moines to Phoenix).
    - \( CA = 73.8x \) (distance from Des Moines to Atlanta).

- **Labels:**
  - \( A \): Atlanta.
  - \( B \): Phoenix.
  - \( C \): Des Moines.

- **No Special Markings:**
  - There are no right angles, parallel lines, or other special markings.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is formed by the points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - The distances between the cities are represented by the sides of the triangle.
  - The total trip distance is the perimeter of the triangle.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The total trip distance is given as 3482 miles.
  - The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides:
    \[
    AB + BC + CA = 3482
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( AB = 150x + 91 \)
  - \( BC = 110x + 53 \)
  - \( CA = 73.8x \)

- **What These Measurements Represent:**
  - These expressions represent the distances between the cities in terms of \( x \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - The total distance of the trip is the sum of the three sides:
    \[
    (150x + 91) + (110x + 53) + 73.8x = 3482
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Is Asking:**
  - The question asks for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which corresponds to the length of side \( AB \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of its sides.
  - Solving for \( x \) will allow us to find the specific lengths of the sides.

- **Information Needed:**
  - Solve the equation for the perimeter to find \( x \).
  - Substitute \( x \) into the expression for \( AB \) to find the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and its sides.
  - Capture the measurements of the sides in terms of \( x \).
  - Represent the perimeter constraint.

- **Completeness Check:**
  - All visible information from the diagram is included.
  - The relationships between the sides and the perimeter are captured.
