QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram contains multiple geometric shapes and points:
    - A hexagon \( WXYZW'EF \).
    - Several smaller triangles and parallelograms within the hexagon.
    - Points labeled \( W, X, Y, Z, W', E, F \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines connecting the points form the sides of the hexagon and internal segments.
  - Specific line segments are highlighted:
    - \( WX \), \( W'X \), \( EF \), and others.

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - \( EF = 10.5 \).
  - \( W'F = 14 \).
  - The diagram includes pink dashed lines indicating symmetry or congruence.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Pink dashed lines suggest congruent or parallel segments.
  - Arrows indicate directions but do not provide additional geometric constraints.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Hexagon Structure**:
  - The hexagon \( WXYZW'EF \) is symmetric about the vertical axis through \( W \) and \( W' \).
  - The pink dashed lines suggest that certain segments are congruent or parallel.

- **Internal Triangles and Parallelograms**:
  - Smaller triangles and parallelograms are formed within the hexagon.
  - These shapes appear to have specific relationships due to the symmetry and congruence indicated by the dashed lines.

- **Congruence and Symmetry**:
  - The dashed lines suggest that certain segments like \( WX \) and \( W'X \) might be congruent.
  - The symmetry about the vertical axis implies that corresponding sides and angles are equal.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( EF = 10.5 \).
  - \( W'F = 14 \).

- **Inferred Relationships**:
  - Since the hexagon appears symmetric, the segment \( WX \) is likely equal to \( W'X \).
  - The symmetry suggests that the hexagon's structure can be analyzed using congruence and proportional relationships.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Goal**: Find the value of \( x \), which represents the length of the segment \( WX \).
- **Relevant Properties**:
  - The symmetry of the hexagon implies that \( WX = W'X \).
  - The given measurements \( EF = 10.5 \) and \( W'F = 14 \) can be used to establish relationships between the segments.
  - The problem likely involves using the symmetry and proportional relationships to determine \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Shapes and Points**:
  - Define the hexagon and its constituent points and lines.
  - Identify congruent and parallel segments using the pink dashed lines.

- **Predicates for Measurements**:
  - Use the given measurements \( EF = 10.5 \) and \( W'F = 14 \).
  - Relate these measurements to the unknown segment \( WX \) using symmetry and proportionality.

- **Predicates for Relationships**:
  - Use symmetry to establish \( WX = W'X \).
  - Use congruence and parallelism indicated by the pink dashed lines.
