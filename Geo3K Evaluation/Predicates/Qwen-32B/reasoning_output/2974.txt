STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2974
================================================================================
QUESTION: P Q R S is a rhombus inscribed in a circle. Find m \widehat S P.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Four points labeled \( P, Q, R, S \).
  - These points form a quadrilateral \( PQRS \).
  - The quadrilateral \( PQRS \) is inscribed in a circle, indicating it is cyclic.
  - The quadrilateral is labeled as a rhombus, meaning all sides are equal.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines connecting the points \( P, Q, R, S \) form the sides of the rhombus.
  - The diagonals of the rhombus intersect at point \( C \), which is also the center of the circle.

- **Circumcircle:**
  - A circle is drawn around the rhombus, passing through all four vertices \( P, Q, R, S \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The rhombus is symmetric, and its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
  - The circumcircle indicates that opposite angles of the rhombus are supplementary.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rhombus Properties:**
  - All sides are equal: \( PQ = QR = RS = SP \).
  - Diagonals are perpendicular: \( PR \perp QS \).
  - Diagonals bisect each other: \( C \) is the midpoint of both \( PR \) and \( QS \).
  
- **Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties:**
  - Opposite angles are supplementary: \( \angle PQR + \angle RSP = 180^\circ \), \( \angle QRS + \angle SPQ = 180^\circ \).
  - The arc lengths subtended by the chords are related to the central angles.

- **Intersections and Symmetry:**
  - The diagonals \( PR \) and \( QS \) intersect at the center \( C \) of the circle, which is also the center of the rhombus.
  - The diagonals divide the rhombus into four congruent right triangles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Information:**
  - The quadrilateral \( PQRS \) is a rhombus.
  - The rhombus is inscribed in a circle.
  - No specific numerical measurements are provided for angles or side lengths.

- **Implied Measurements:**
  - Since \( PQRS \) is a rhombus, its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors.
  - The arcs subtended by the sides of the rhombus are equal in pairs due to symmetry.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m \widehat{SP} \), the measure of the arc \( SP \) on the circumcircle.
- To find \( m \widehat{SP} \), we need to use the properties of the rhombus and the circle:
  - In a rhombus inscribed in a circle, the rhombus must be a square (since only squares among rhombuses can be cyclic).
  - Each interior angle of the square is \( 90^\circ \), and the corresponding central angle subtending each side is also \( 90^\circ \).
  - Therefore, the arc \( SP \) subtends a central angle of \( 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rhombus, its diagonals, the circle, and the relationships between them.
- We must capture the fact that the rhombus is cyclic and that it is a square (implied by being cyclic).
- Finally, we need to express the relationship between the arc \( SP \) and the central angle it subtends.
