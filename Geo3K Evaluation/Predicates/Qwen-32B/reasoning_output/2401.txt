REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
- **Points**: The triangle has vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the triangle are \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \). There is also a dashed line from \( B \) to the midpoint of \( AC \), which appears to be the altitude.
- **Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 13 \)
  - \( BC = 13 \)
  - \( AC = 10 \)
- **Special Markings**:
  - The dashed line from \( B \) to \( AC \) forms a right angle with \( AC \), indicating it is the altitude.
  - The triangle appears to be isosceles because \( AB = BC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = BC \).
  - The dashed line from \( B \) to \( AC \) is the altitude, which is also the median because \( AC \) is divided into two equal segments.
  - The altitude forms right angles with \( AC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AB = 13 \)
  - \( BC = 13 \)
  - \( AC = 10 \)
- **Implications**:
  - Since the altitude divides \( AC \) into two equal parts, each segment is \( \frac{AC}{2} = 5 \).
  - The altitude splits \( \triangle ABC \) into two congruent right triangles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Goal**: Find the area of \( \triangle ABC \).
- **Relevant Properties**:
  - The altitude splits the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles.
  - The area of a triangle is given by \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
  - We need to determine the altitude (height) of the triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the triangle and its sides.
  - Specify the isosceles property and the altitude.
  - Indicate the base and the height.
  - Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the altitude.
