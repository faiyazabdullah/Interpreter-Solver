REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains a right triangle \( \triangle AEC \).
  - There is an additional point \( B \) forming a larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( AE \) is labeled as \( x \).
  - \( EC \) is part of the right triangle \( \triangle AEC \).
  - \( BC \) is labeled as \( 10\sqrt{3} \).
  - \( AB \) is part of the larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle AEC \) is marked as a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
  - \( \angle EBC \) is marked as \( 30^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol at \( \angle AEC \) indicates \( \triangle AEC \) is a right triangle.
  - No other specific markings (like parallel or congruence) are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle AEC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle AEC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle BEC \) is also a right triangle because \( \angle AEC = 90^\circ \) implies \( \angle BEC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle EBC = 30^\circ \) implies that \( \triangle BEC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle.
  - The hypotenuse of \( \triangle BEC \) is \( BC = 10\sqrt{3} \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 10\sqrt{3} \).
  - \( \angle EBC = 30^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AEC = 90^\circ \).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).
  - Here, \( BC \) is the hypotenuse, so we can determine the lengths of \( BE \) and \( EC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the length of \( AE \).
- To find \( x \), we need to:
  1. Use the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle \( \triangle BEC \) to find \( EC \).
  2. Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AEC \) to find \( AE \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements clearly.
- Predicates will include the right triangles, angles, side lengths, and the relationships between them.
