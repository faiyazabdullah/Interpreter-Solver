REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image consists of multiple parallel lines and segments forming a grid-like structure.
  - Key points are labeled as \( G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P \).
  - There are three horizontal lines and three vertical lines intersecting to form parallelograms and rectangles.
  
- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - Horizontal lines are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
    - Top row: \( 7x - 2 \)
    - Middle row: \( 4x + 3 \)
    - Bottom row: No explicit expression, but the segments appear equal to the middle row.
  - Vertical lines are labeled with measurements:
    - Leftmost vertical segment: No explicit measurement.
    - Rightmost vertical segments: Both labeled as 8.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Arrowheads indicate parallel lines.
  - Double arrowheads indicate equal lengths for segments within the same horizontal line.
  - Pink arrows highlight equal segments.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - The horizontal lines are parallel to each other.
  - The vertical lines are parallel to each other.
  
- **Congruent Segments**:
  - Within each horizontal line, segments are marked as congruent (equal in length).
  - For example, the top row has segments \( FG \) and \( OP \) marked as equal, and so on.

- **Rectangles and Parallelograms**:
  - The overall structure forms multiple rectangles and parallelograms due to the parallel lines and equal segment markings.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Horizontal Measurements**:
  - Top row: \( 7x - 2 \)
  - Middle row: \( 4x + 3 \)
  - Bottom row: Since it is congruent to the middle row, its length is also \( 4x + 3 \).

- **Vertical Measurements**:
  - Both vertical segments on the right are explicitly labeled as 8.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we need to use the relationships between the horizontal measurements. Specifically, since the top and middle rows are part of the same structure, their total lengths must be consistent with the properties of the figure.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key relationships involve the equality of segment lengths within each row and the consistency of the structure.
- Predicates will capture the parallelism, congruence, and measurement constraints.
