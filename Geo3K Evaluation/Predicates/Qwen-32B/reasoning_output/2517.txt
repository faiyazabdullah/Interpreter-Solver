STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2517
================================================================================
QUESTION: \overrightarrow B A and \overrightarrow B C are opposite rays and \overrightarrow B D bisects \angle A B F. If m \angle F B C = 2 x + 25 and m \angle A B F = 10 x - 1, find m \angle D B F.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The image contains labeled points \( A, B, C, D, F \).
- **Lines/Rays**: 
  - \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\) are opposite rays originating from point \( B \).
  - \(\overrightarrow{BD}\) is a ray originating from point \( B \).
  - \(\overrightarrow{BF}\) is a ray originating from point \( B \).
- **Angles**: 
  - \(\angle ABF\) is formed by rays \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BF}\).
  - \(\angle FBC\) is formed by rays \(\overrightarrow{BF}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\).
  - \(\angle DBF\) is formed by rays \(\overrightarrow{BD}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BF}\).
- **Measurements**:
  - The measure of \(\angle FBC\) is given as \(2x + 25\).
  - The measure of \(\angle ABF\) is given as \(10x - 1\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Opposite Rays**: Since \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\) are opposite rays, they form a straight line through point \( B \). Therefore, \(\angle ABC\) is a straight angle (\(180^\circ\)).
- **Bisector**: Ray \(\overrightarrow{BD}\) bisects \(\angle ABF\), meaning \(\angle DBF = \angle ABD\).
- **Adjacent Angles**: \(\angle ABF\) and \(\angle FBC\) are adjacent angles because they share the common side \(\overrightarrow{BF}\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle FBC = 2x + 25 \)
  - \( m\angle ABF = 10x - 1 \)
- **Straight Line Constraint**: Since \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\) are opposite rays, the sum of the measures of \(\angle ABF\) and \(\angle FBC\) must equal \(180^\circ\):
  \[
  m\angle ABF + m\angle FBC = 180^\circ
  \]
  Substituting the given expressions:
  \[
  (10x - 1) + (2x + 25) = 180
  \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle DBF\).
- Since \(\overrightarrow{BD}\) bisects \(\angle ABF\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle ABF\) first and then divide it by 2 to get \( m\angle DBF \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the fact that \(\overrightarrow{BA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{BC}\) are opposite rays, \(\overrightarrow{BD}\) bisects \(\angle ABF\), and the given angle measures.
