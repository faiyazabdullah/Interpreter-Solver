================================================================================

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram consists of a large triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Within \( \triangle ABC \), there are additional segments connecting points:
    - \( D \) lies on \( AC \).
    - \( E \) lies on \( BC \).
    - Segments \( CD \), \( DE \), \( CE \), and \( EB \) are formed.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - \( CA = 10 \).
  - \( CD = 2 \).
  - \( CE = t - 2 \).
  - \( EB = t + 1 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Two right-angle symbols are present:
    - One at \( \angle ADB \).
    - One at \( \angle CDE \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ADB \) and \( \triangle CDE \) are right triangles due to the right-angle symbols.
  - \( D \) and \( E \) are interior points on \( AC \) and \( BC \), respectively.
  - Segments \( CD \), \( DE \), and \( EB \) form parts of the larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The total length of \( CB \) is the sum of \( CE \) and \( EB \):
    \[
    CB = CE + EB = (t - 2) + (t + 1) = 2t - 1.
    \]
  - The segment \( CD \) is given as 2, and \( CA \) is given as 10, so \( DA = CA - CD = 10 - 2 = 8 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( CA = 10 \).
  - \( CD = 2 \).
  - \( CE = t - 2 \).
  - \( EB = t + 1 \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - \( DA = CA - CD = 10 - 2 = 8 \).
  - \( CB = CE + EB = (t - 2) + (t + 1) = 2t - 1 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The problem provides expressions for \( CE \) and \( EB \) in terms of \( t \):
    - \( CE = t - 2 \).
    - \( EB = t + 1 \).
  - It also gives specific lengths:
    - \( CD = 2 \).
    - \( CA = 10 \).
  - The goal is to find the value of \( CE \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The total length of \( CB \) is determined by the sum of \( CE \) and \( EB \).
  - The given lengths and expressions allow us to set up an equation to solve for \( t \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the points, lines, and triangles.
  - Represent the right angles.
  - Capture the given lengths and relationships.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are included.
