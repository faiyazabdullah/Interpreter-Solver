REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure consists of a right triangle \( XYZ \).
  - Points \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - The right angle is at vertex \( Y \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( XY \) is one leg of the triangle.
  - \( XZ \) is the hypotenuse.
  - \( YZ \) is the other leg of the triangle.

- **Measurements**:
  - The length of \( XY \) is given as 5 units.
  - The length of \( XZ \) is given as 9 units.

- **Special Markings**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at \( \angle XYZ \), indicating \( \angle XYZ = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle XYZ \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( Y \).
  - \( XY \) and \( YZ \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( XZ \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to this triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( XY = 5 \) units.
  - \( XZ = 9 \) units.
  - The length of \( YZ \) is unknown and needs to be determined using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle Z \) to the nearest tenth.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - In a right triangle, trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) can be used to find angles.
  - Specifically, we can use the sine function since we know the opposite side (\( XY \)) and the hypotenuse (\( XZ \)):
    \[
    \sin(\angle Z) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{XY}{XZ}
    \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the triangle and its vertices.
  - Specify the right angle.
  - Indicate the lengths of the sides.
  - Use the Pythagorean theorem and trigonometric relationships implicitly through the predicates.
