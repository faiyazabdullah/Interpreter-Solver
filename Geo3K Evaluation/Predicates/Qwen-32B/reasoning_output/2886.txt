REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle with center \( O \).
  - Four points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Chords \( AB, BC, CD, DA \) form a cyclic quadrilateral \( ABCD \).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - \( AB, BC, CD, DA \) are chords of the circle.
  - Angles are labeled at specific positions:
    - \( \angle A = 58^\circ \).
    - The arc \( BC \) is labeled as \( 2x \).
    - The arc \( BD \) is labeled as \( 3y + 4 \).
    - The arc \( DC \) is labeled as \( 2y + 16 \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The measure of \( \angle A \) is explicitly given as \( 58^\circ \).
  - The arcs \( BC \), \( BD \), and \( DC \) are expressed in terms of variables \( x \) and \( y \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties**:
  - Since \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circumference of the circle, \( ABCD \) is a cyclic quadrilateral.
  - Opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum to \( 180^\circ \):
    \[
    \angle A + \angle C = 180^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ.
    \]

- **Arc Relationships**:
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
  - For example, \( \angle A \) intercepts the arc \( BD \), so:
    \[
    \text{Measure of } \angle A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of arc } BD.
    \]
  - Similarly, other angles can be related to their intercepted arcs.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle A = 58^\circ \).
  - Arcs are expressed in terms of variables:
    - Arc \( BC = 2x \).
    - Arc \( BD = 3y + 4 \).
    - Arc \( DC = 2y + 16 \).

- **Relationships**:
  - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore, the sum of all arcs is:
    \[
    \text{Arc } AB + \text{Arc } BC + \text{Arc } CD + \text{Arc } DA = 360^\circ.
    \]
  - Using the fact that \( \angle A = 58^\circ \), we can express the measure of arc \( BD \) as:
    \[
    \text{Arc } BD = 2 \times \angle A = 2 \times 58 = 116^\circ.
    \]
  - This gives us the equation:
    \[
    3y + 4 = 116.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle D \).
- To find \( \angle D \), we need to use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals:
  \[
  \angle B + \angle D = 180^\circ.
  \]
- We need to determine \( \angle B \) using the given arc measures and the relationships between the angles and arcs.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the visible relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the geometric shapes, points, lines, angles, and arc measures.
- We will not include the final answer or solving steps but will provide enough information to derive it.
