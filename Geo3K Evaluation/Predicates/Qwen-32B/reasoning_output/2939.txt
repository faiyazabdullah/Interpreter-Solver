### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points labeled: \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Line segments: \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - \( BC \) is vertical and forms a right angle with \( AB \) at point \( B \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The hypotenuse \( CA \) is labeled as 18 units.
  - The side \( BC \) is labeled as \( x \).
  - The side \( AB \) is labeled as \( y \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle ABC \).
  - An angle measure of \( 60^\circ \) is explicitly labeled at \( \angle BAC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \) implies \( \angle BCA = 30^\circ \) because the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The sides of the triangle satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.
  - The triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, where the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle is half the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - Hypotenuse \( CA = 18 \).
  - Side \( BC = x \).
  - Side \( AB = y \).

- **Implications**:
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( BC \)) is half the hypotenuse.
  - Therefore, \( BC = \frac{1}{2} \times CA = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which corresponds to the length of side \( BC \).
- From the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, we know \( BC = \frac{1}{2} \times CA \).
- Given \( CA = 18 \), we can directly compute \( x = 9 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates will describe the triangle, its angles, sides, and the specific properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.
