REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: Image Analysis
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle with center \( O \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, X \) are marked on or around the circle.
  - Chords \( CD \) and radii \( OB \) and \( OC \) are drawn.
  - Point \( X \) lies on the intersection of chords or radii.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line \( OB \) is a radius of the circle.
  - Line \( CD \) is a chord of the circle.
  - Line \( CX \) is a segment connecting points \( C \) and \( X \).

- **Angles and Markings**:
  - A right-angle symbol is placed where \( OB \) intersects \( CD \), indicating \( OB \perp CD \).
  - Arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is labeled with a measure of 134 degrees.

- **Measurements**:
  - Radius \( OB = 13 \) inches.
  - Chord \( CD = 24 \) inches.
  - Arc \( \widehat{CD} = 134^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: Relationship Identification
- **Relationships**:
  - \( OB \) is a radius of the circle and is perpendicular to the chord \( CD \). This implies that \( OB \) bisects \( CD \) at its midpoint.
  - \( CD \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( \widehat{CD} \) is an arc subtended by the chord \( CD \).
  - \( \widehat{CB} \) is another arc of the circle, and we need to find its measure.

#### STEP 3: Measurement Analysis
- **Given Measurements**:
  - Radius \( OB = 13 \) inches.
  - Chord \( CD = 24 \) inches.
  - Arc \( \widehat{CD} = 134^\circ \).

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \( OB \perp CD \), \( OB \) bisects \( CD \) into two equal segments, each of length \( \frac{CD}{2} = 12 \) inches.
  - The central angle subtending \( \widehat{CD} \) is \( 134^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: Question Analysis
- The question asks us to find the measure of arc \( \widehat{CB} \).
- To solve this, we need to use the fact that the total circumference of the circle corresponds to \( 360^\circ \). The measure of \( \widehat{CB} \) can be found by considering the remaining arcs in the circle after accounting for \( \widehat{CD} \).

#### STEP 5: Predicate Planning
- We need to represent all the visible relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates will cover the circle, its radius, the chord, the perpendicularity, the arc measures, and the relationships between them.
