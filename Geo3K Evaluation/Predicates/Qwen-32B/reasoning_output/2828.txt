REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Two triangles are shown: \(\triangle JKL\) and \(\triangle WYZ\).
  - Both triangles have labeled vertices: \(J, K, L\) for the left triangle and \(W, Y, Z\) for the right triangle.
  
- **Lines**:
  - Lines connecting the vertices form the sides of the triangles.
  
- **Angles**:
  - In \(\triangle JKL\):
    - \(\angle J\) is labeled as \((4x - 13)^\circ\).
    - \(\angle K\) is labeled as \(y^\circ\).
    - \(\angle L\) is not explicitly labeled but can be determined using the angle sum property of a triangle.
  - In \(\triangle WYZ\):
    - \(\angle W\) is labeled as \(71^\circ\).
    - \(\angle Z\) is labeled as \(44^\circ\).
    - \(\angle Y\) is not explicitly labeled but can be determined using the angle sum property of a triangle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No special markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruence symbols are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similar Triangles**:
  - The problem states \(\triangle JKL \sim \triangle WYZ\). This implies that the corresponding angles of the two triangles are equal, and the corresponding sides are proportional.
  
- **Corresponding Angles**:
  - Since the triangles are similar, the following angle correspondences hold:
    - \(\angle J \leftrightarrow \angle W\)
    - \(\angle K \leftrightarrow \angle Y\)
    - \(\angle L \leftrightarrow \angle Z\)

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Explicit Measurements**:
  - \(\triangle WYZ\):
    - \(\angle W = 71^\circ\)
    - \(\angle Z = 44^\circ\)
  - \(\triangle JKL\):
    - \(\angle J = (4x - 13)^\circ\)
    - \(\angle K = y^\circ\)

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Using the angle sum property of a triangle (\(\angle J + \angle K + \angle L = 180^\circ\)):
    - For \(\triangle WYZ\): \(\angle Y = 180^\circ - \angle W - \angle Z = 180^\circ - 71^\circ - 44^\circ = 65^\circ\).
    - For \(\triangle JKL\): \(\angle L = 180^\circ - \angle J - \angle K = 180^\circ - (4x - 13) - y\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\).
- To solve for \(x\), we use the fact that corresponding angles in similar triangles are equal:
  - \(\angle J = \angle W\), so \((4x - 13)^\circ = 71^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key relationships are the similarity of the triangles and the equality of corresponding angles.
