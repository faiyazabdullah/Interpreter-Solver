REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Rectangle \( \text{L M N P} \): Points \( \text{L, M, N, P} \) form a rectangle.
  - Parallelogram \( \text{L K M J} \): Points \( \text{L, K, M, J} \) form a parallelogram.
  
- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points: \( \text{P, L, N, M, K, J} \)
  - Lines: 
    - \( \text{L N} \): One side of the rectangle.
    - \( \text{L J} \): Diagonal of the parallelogram.
    - \( \text{P J} \): Segment connecting point \( \text{P} \) (top-right corner of the rectangle) to point \( \text{J} \) inside the parallelogram.

- **Measurements:**
  - \( \text{LN} = 10 \)
  - \( \text{LJ} = 2x + 1 \)
  - \( \text{PJ} = 3x - 1 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - The rectangle and parallelogram are clearly defined by their respective points.
  - No additional markings such as right angles, congruence, or symmetry are explicitly shown.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rectangle Properties:**
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
  - All internal angles are right angles.
  - Diagonals are equal in length.

- **Parallelogram Properties:**
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Diagonals bisect each other.

- **Connections:**
  - Point \( \text{J} \) is a common point between the parallelogram and the rectangle.
  - Point \( \text{P} \) is one vertex of the rectangle and lies outside the parallelogram.
  - The segment \( \text{PJ} \) connects the top-right corner of the rectangle to a point inside the parallelogram.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \text{LN} = 10 \): The length of one side of the rectangle.
  - \( \text{LJ} = 2x + 1 \): The length of the diagonal of the parallelogram.
  - \( \text{PJ} = 3x - 1 \): The length of the segment from the top-right corner of the rectangle to point \( \text{J} \).

- **Relationships:**
  - Since \( \text{L J} \) is a diagonal of the parallelogram, it is not directly related to the rectangle's dimensions unless further constraints are provided.
  - The segment \( \text{PJ} \) is external to the parallelogram and depends on the coordinates of \( \text{P} \) and \( \text{J} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \) given the equations for \( \text{LJ} \) and \( \text{PJ} \).
- To solve for \( x \), we need to establish a relationship between \( \text{LJ} \) and \( \text{PJ} \). Since both expressions involve \( x \), we can set up an equation based on their relative positions and lengths.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The key relationships are:
  1. \( \text{L N} = 10 \) (a fixed measurement).
  2. \( \text{L J} = 2x + 1 \) (diagonal of the parallelogram).
  3. \( \text{P J} = 3x - 1 \) (segment connecting \( \text{P} \) to \( \text{J} \)).
- We will use these relationships to generate atomic predicates that capture the structure of the problem.
