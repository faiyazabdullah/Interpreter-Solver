REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AB \): The hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - \( BC \): One of the legs of the triangle, adjacent to the right angle.
  - \( AC \): The other leg of the triangle, opposite the right angle.
  
- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \) (indicated by the right angle symbol).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( BC = 4 \) units.
  - The height \( h \) is the length of the hypotenuse \( AB \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( \angle BCA \) is marked as a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
  - \( \angle ABC \) is explicitly labeled as \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \), so \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \)).
  - \( BC \) is one leg of the triangle, and \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle, which has specific side ratios: \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle is half the hypotenuse.
  - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( BC = 4 \) units (opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle).
  - The hypotenuse \( AB = h \) is what we need to find.

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - In a 30-60-90 triangle:
    - If the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle is \( x \), then:
      - The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle is \( x\sqrt{3} \).
      - The hypotenuse is \( 2x \).
    - Here, \( BC = 4 \) corresponds to \( x\sqrt{3} \). Therefore, we can solve for \( x \) and then find \( h = 2x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( h \), the length of the hypotenuse \( AB \).
- To find \( h \), we use the properties of the 30-60-90 triangle and the given measurement \( BC = 4 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using atomic predicates.
- The predicates should capture the triangle, its angles, sides, and the specific properties of the 30-60-90 triangle.
