REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is present with center \( S \).
  - Three points \( R \), \( T \), and \( S \) are marked on or around the circle.
  - \( R \) and \( T \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( S \) is the center of the circle.

- **Lines and Arcs**:
  - Radii \( SR \) and \( ST \) connect the center \( S \) to the points \( R \) and \( T \) on the circumference.
  - An arc is drawn between \( R \) and \( T \).

- **Angles**:
  - The central angle \( \angle RST \) is labeled as \( 93^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The radius of the circle is given as \( 15 \) mm.
  - The shaded region is the sector formed by radii \( SR \) and \( ST \) and the arc \( RT \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The shaded region indicates the sector whose area we need to calculate.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( SR \) and \( ST \) are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.
  - \( \angle RST \) is the central angle of the sector.
  - The shaded region is a sector of the circle.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The radius of the circle is constant.
  - The area of the sector is proportional to the central angle \( \angle RST \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Radius \( SR = ST = 15 \) mm.
  - Central angle \( \angle RST = 93^\circ \).

- **What These Measurements Represent**:
  - The radius is used to compute the area of the circle.
  - The central angle determines the fraction of the circle that the sector occupies.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The problem requires finding the area of the shaded sector.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The area of a sector is given by the formula:
    \[
    \text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
    \]
    where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees and \( r \) is the radius.
  
- **Information Needed**:
  - The radius \( r = 15 \) mm.
  - The central angle \( \theta = 93^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the circle, its center, and points on the circumference.
  - Specify the radius and central angle.
  - Indicate the sector and its shading.
  
- **Completeness Check**:
  - All visible elements (circle, center, radius, angle, shaded sector) are represented.
  - No additional information beyond what is given in the diagram is included.
