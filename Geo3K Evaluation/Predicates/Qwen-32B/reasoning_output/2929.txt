REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( D, W, X, Y, Z, C, G, H, I, J, L \).
- **Lines**: Several lines are drawn connecting these points, forming triangles and other geometric shapes.
- **Angles**: 
  - \( \angle WXJ \) is labeled as \( 130^\circ \).
  - \( \angle WZG \) is labeled as \( 20^\circ \).
  - Other angles are indicated around point \( J \).
- **Ratios**: The ratio \( \frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ} \) is given, suggesting similarity or proportional relationships.
- **Triangles**: Triangles \( \triangle JIH \) and \( \triangle JXY \) are evident.
- **Special Markings**: No specific markings for parallel, perpendicular, or congruent segments are visible.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Proportional Segments**: The ratio \( \frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ} \) suggests that triangles involving these segments might be similar.
- **Angle Relationships**: 
  - \( \angle WXJ = 130^\circ \) is an exterior angle relative to some internal angles.
  - \( \angle WZG = 20^\circ \) is another key angle that may relate to the overall configuration.
- **Triangle Formation**: The points \( J, I, H \) form \( \triangle JIH \), and points \( J, X, Y \) form \( \triangle JXY \). These triangles share a common vertex \( J \).
- **Linear Relationship**: Points \( W, X, Y, Z, C \) lie on a straight line, indicating collinearity.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( m\angle WXJ = 130^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle WZG = 20^\circ \)
- **Proportions**:
  - \( \frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ} \): This indicates a proportional relationship between segments emanating from \( J \).
- **Unspecified Measurements**: The lengths of segments \( IJ, XJ, HJ, YJ \) are not explicitly given, but their ratios are known.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for \( m\angle J \), the measure of the angle at vertex \( J \) in the context of the given diagram.
- To find \( m\angle J \), we need to use the given angle measures and the proportional relationships to deduce the internal angles of the triangles formed around point \( J \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships, including:
  - The proportional segments \( \frac{IJ}{XJ} = \frac{HJ}{YJ} \).
  - The given angles \( \angle WXJ \) and \( \angle WZG \).
  - The collinearity of points \( W, X, Y, Z, C \).
  - The formation of triangles \( \triangle JIH \) and \( \triangle JXY \).
- Predicates should capture these relationships without directly solving for \( m\angle J \).
