QUESTION: In \triangle P Q R, S T \parallel R Q. If P S = 12.5, S R = 5, and P T = 15, find T Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle PQR \).
  - There is a smaller triangle \( \triangle PST \) within \( \triangle PQR \).
  - Points labeled are \( P, Q, R, S, T \).

- **Lines:**
  - Lines \( PQ, QR, RP \) form \( \triangle PQR \).
  - Lines \( PS, SR, PT, TQ \) form \( \triangle PST \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Two pink triangles indicate that \( ST \parallel RQ \).
  - No right angles or other specific angle markings are present.

- **Measurements:**
  - \( PS = 12.5 \)
  - \( SR = 5 \)
  - \( PT = 15 \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Relationship:**
  - Since \( ST \parallel RQ \), \( \triangle PST \) is similar to \( \triangle PQR \) by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (or Thales' theorem).

- **Similar Triangles:**
  - The similarity implies proportional sides: \( \frac{PS}{PR} = \frac{PT}{PQ} = \frac{ST}{RQ} \).

- **Proportional Segments:**
  - The segments along \( PR \) and \( PQ \) are divided proportionally due to the parallel line \( ST \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( PS = 12.5 \)
  - \( SR = 5 \)
  - \( PT = 15 \)

- **Unknown Measurement:**
  - We need to find \( TQ \).

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( S \) divides \( PR \) into segments \( PS \) and \( SR \), the total length of \( PR \) is \( PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5 \).
  - Similarly, \( T \) divides \( PQ \) into segments \( PT \) and \( TQ \). Let \( TQ = x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \( TQ \).
- Using the similarity of triangles \( \triangle PST \) and \( \triangle PQR \), we know:
  \[
  \frac{PS}{PR} = \frac{PT}{PQ}
  \]
- We can use this proportionality to solve for \( TQ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Ensure all visible relationships and constraints are captured without directly stating the solution.
