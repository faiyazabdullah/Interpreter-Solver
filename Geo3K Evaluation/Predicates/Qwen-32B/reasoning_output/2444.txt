================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure contains a right triangle \( \triangle BCD \) with vertices \( B, C, \) and \( D \).
  - There is also a larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \) that includes the right triangle \( \triangle BCD \).
  
- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - Line \( BD \) is vertical and has a length of 22 units.
  - Line \( CD \) is horizontal and forms the base of the right triangle \( \triangle BCD \).
  - Line \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle BCD \).
  - Line \( AC \) is part of the larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \) and has a length of 40 units.
  
- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle BDC \) is a right angle (marked with a square symbol).
  - Angles \( x^\circ \) and \( y^\circ \) are labeled at vertices \( B \) and \( C \), respectively.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right angle at \( D \) indicates that \( \triangle BCD \) is a right triangle.
  - Horizontal and vertical lines suggest that \( BD \) and \( CD \) are perpendicular.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle BCD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a larger triangle that includes \( \triangle BCD \).
  - \( BD \) is the height of both \( \triangle BCD \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( CD \) is the base of \( \triangle BCD \) and part of the base of \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - In \( \triangle BCD \), the Pythagorean theorem applies: \( BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 \).
  - In \( \triangle ABC \), the length of \( AC \) is given as 40 units.
  - The angle \( x^\circ \) is the angle at vertex \( B \) in \( \triangle BCD \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( BD = 22 \) units (vertical side of \( \triangle BCD \)).
  - \( AC = 40 \) units (hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \)).
  
- **What Measurements Represent**:
  - \( BD \) and \( CD \) are the legs of the right triangle \( \triangle BCD \).
  - \( BC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle BCD \).
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The question asks for the measure of angle \( x \) in degrees.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - Since \( \triangle BCD \) is a right triangle, we can use trigonometric relationships involving \( BD \) (opposite side) and \( BC \) (hypotenuse).
  - We need to find \( BC \) using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BCD \), and then use the sine function to find \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the triangles, lines, and angles.
  - Capture the right angle at \( D \).
  - Include the lengths of the sides and the hypotenuses.
  - Use trigonometric relationships to relate the angle \( x \) to the sides of the triangle.
