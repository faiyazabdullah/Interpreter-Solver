REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains a rhombus \(ABCD\).
  - There is a diagonal \(AC\) dividing the rhombus into two triangles.
  - An additional point \(E\) lies outside the rhombus, connected to \(D\).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the rhombus.
  - Diagonal \(AC\) intersects diagonal \(BD\) at point \(O\) (though not explicitly labeled in the image).
  - Angle \(\angle CDE\) is explicitly marked as \(116^\circ\).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No right-angle symbols, congruence marks, or parallel markers are visible.
  - The focus is on the relationship between the diagonals and the angles formed.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Rhombus**:
  - All sides of a rhombus are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
  - The diagonals also bisect the angles of the rhombus.

- **Relevant Relationships**:
  - Since \(AC\) is a diagonal, it divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles (\(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ADC\)).
  - The other diagonal \(BD\) will intersect \(AC\) at its midpoint, forming right angles at the intersection.

- **External Angle \(\angle CDE\)**:
  - \(\angle CDE\) is an exterior angle to \(\triangle CDE\).
  - It is related to the internal angles of the rhombus and the triangle formed.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**:
  - \(\text{Measure of } \angle CDE = 116^\circ\).

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \(AC\) is a diagonal of the rhombus, it bisects \(\angle ADC\) and \(\angle ABC\).
  - The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, so \(\angle AOD = 90^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - We need to find the measure of \(\angle ACD\).

- **Relevant Properties**:
  - In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles.
  - The sum of angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\).
  - The external angle \(\angle CDE\) is related to the internal angles of \(\triangle CDE\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Rhombus Properties**:
  - Define the rhombus and its diagonals.
  - Capture the property that diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
  - Indicate that the diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus.

- **Predicates for Angles**:
  - Use the given measurement \(\angle CDE = 116^\circ\).
  - Relate \(\angle ACD\) to the internal angles of the rhombus and the properties of the diagonals.

- **Completeness**:
  - Ensure all visible relationships and measurements are represented.
  - Avoid including the final answer or derived solutions.
