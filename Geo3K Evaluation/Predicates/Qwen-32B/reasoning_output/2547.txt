REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A triangle \( \triangle RQS \) is shown.
  - A circle is inscribed in \( \triangle RQS \), tangent to its sides at points \( U, V, T \).
  - Points \( R, Q, S \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Points \( U, V, T \) are the points of tangency where the circle touches the sides \( QR, RS, QS \) respectively.
  - Point \( W \) is the center of the inscribed circle.
  
- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( QR = 14 \) inches.
  - \( RS = 27 \) inches.
  - \( QS = 17 \) inches.
  - \( QT = 2x \) inches (part of the base \( QS \)).
  - \( TS = 17 \) inches (the remaining part of the base \( QS \)).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The circle is inscribed in the triangle, implying tangency at points \( U, V, T \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The circle is tangent to the sides of \( \triangle RQS \) at points \( U, V, T \).
  - The segments from the vertices to the points of tangency are equal in pairs:
    - \( QU = RU \)
    - \( RV = SV \)
    - \( RT = TU \)
  - The sum of the segments along the sides of the triangle must match the total lengths of the sides.

- **Constraints:**
  - The total length of \( QS \) is split into \( QT = 2x \) and \( TS = 17 \).
  - The tangency property ensures that the segments from the vertices to the points of tangency are equal.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( QR = 14 \) inches.
  - \( RS = 27 \) inches.
  - \( QS = 17 \) inches.
  - \( QT = 2x \) inches.
  - \( TS = 17 \) inches.

- **Relationships:**
  - Since \( QS = QT + TS \), we have:
    \[
    QS = 2x + 17
    \]
    Given \( QS = 17 \), this implies:
    \[
    2x + 17 = 17
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks for the value of \( x \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The tangency property of the incircle ensures that the segments from the vertices to the points of tangency are equal.
  - The total length of \( QS \) is split into \( QT = 2x \) and \( TS = 17 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle, circle, and tangency points.
  - Capture the measurements and relationships between the segments.
  - Ensure all visible information is included without directly solving for \( x \).
