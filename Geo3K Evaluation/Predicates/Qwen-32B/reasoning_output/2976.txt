QUESTION: Find the measure of \angle 2.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains several triangles and straight lines.
  - Key points: \( A, B, C, D, E \).
  - Lines: \( AB, BC, CD, DE, AE \).

- **Angles and Measurements:**
  - \( \angle GCB = 23^\circ \) (angle at point \( C \)).
  - \( \angle DBC = 32^\circ \) (angle at point \( D \)).
  - \( \angle EAB = 22^\circ \) (angle at point \( E \)).
  - \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3 \) are marked within the figure.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No explicit markings for parallel, perpendicular, or congruent lines are visible.
  - The figure suggests some linear relationships due to the collinearity of points \( A, B, E \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Collinearity:**
  - Points \( A, B, E \) lie on the same straight line.
  - Points \( C, B, D \) form a triangle \( \triangle CBD \).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - \( \angle DBC \) and \( \angle GCB \) are exterior and interior angles relative to line \( BC \).
  - \( \angle 2 \) is part of the linear pair with \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \).

- **Triangle Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle CBD \) has angles \( \angle DBC \) and \( \angle GCB \).
  - \( \triangle ABE \) has angle \( \angle EAB \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles:**
  - \( \angle GCB = 23^\circ \).
  - \( \angle DBC = 32^\circ \).
  - \( \angle EAB = 22^\circ \).

- **Derived Angles:**
  - Since \( A, B, E \) are collinear, \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 2 \) is the focus of the problem, and we need to determine its measure.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 2 \).
- To find \( \angle 2 \), we need to use the properties of angles formed by intersecting lines and the sum of angles in a triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships, including:
  - Collinearity of points.
  - Angle measurements and relationships.
  - Linear pairs and supplementary angles.
