REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains numerous labeled points such as \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z \).
- **Lines**: Several lines are drawn, including parallel lines and intersecting lines. Notable lines are:
  - Lines \( j \) and \( q \) are parallel.
  - Lines \( p \) and \( m \) are parallel.
  - Transversals intersect these parallel lines.
- **Angles**: Various angles are marked and labeled with numbers (e.g., \( \angle 1, \angle 3, \angle 6 \)).
- **Special Markings**:
  - Parallel lines are marked with arrows.
  - Corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles are indicated.
  - Given measurements: \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \) and \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**: 
  - Lines \( j \) and \( q \) are parallel.
  - Lines \( p \) and \( m \) are parallel.
- **Transversals**:
  - Line \( k \) intersects parallel lines \( j \) and \( q \).
  - Line \( n \) intersects parallel lines \( p \) and \( m \).
- **Angle Relationships**:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.
  - Vertical angles are equal.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle 1 = 50^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 60^\circ \)
- **Implications**:
  - Since \( j \parallel q \) and \( k \) is a transversal, \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are corresponding angles, so \( m\angle 2 = 50^\circ \).
  - Similarly, since \( p \parallel m \) and \( n \) is a transversal, \( \angle 3 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are corresponding angles, so \( m\angle 4 = 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 6 \).
- To find \( \angle 6 \), we need to use the relationships between the angles formed by the transversals and the parallel lines.
- Key relationships to consider:
  - \( \angle 6 \) is related to \( \angle 4 \) through the properties of parallel lines and transversals.
  - Specifically, \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are consecutive interior angles, so they are supplementary.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates should capture the parallel lines, transversals, angle relationships, and given measurements.
