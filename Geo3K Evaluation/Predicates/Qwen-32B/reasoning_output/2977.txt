REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram contains a triangle \( \triangle HGJ \).
  - There are additional segments and points: \( D \) lies on the base \( GJ \), dividing it into two segments \( GD \) and \( DJ \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( HG = 7 \)
  - \( HJ = 10 \)
  - \( HD \) is an altitude from \( H \) to \( GJ \), making \( \angle HDG \) and \( \angle HDJ \) right angles.
  - \( GD = 2x - 2 \)
  - \( DJ = 2x + 4 \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols are present at \( \angle HDG \) and \( \angle HDJ \), indicating that \( HD \) is perpendicular to \( GJ \).
  - No other specific markings suggest parallelism, congruence, or symmetry.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle HDG \) and \( \triangle HDJ \) are right triangles because \( HD \) is perpendicular to \( GJ \).
  - The total length of the base \( GJ \) is the sum of \( GD \) and \( DJ \):
    \[
    GJ = GD + DJ
    \]
  - Since \( D \) is a point on \( GJ \), the segments \( GD \) and \( DJ \) form the entire base \( GJ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( HG = 7 \)
  - \( HJ = 10 \)
  - \( GD = 2x - 2 \)
  - \( DJ = 2x + 4 \)

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - The total length of \( GJ \) is:
    \[
    GJ = GD + DJ = (2x - 2) + (2x + 4)
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( GD \).
- To find \( GD \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) using the given relationships and solve for \( GD = 2x - 2 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the structure of the triangle, the right angles, the segments, and the relationships between the segments.
