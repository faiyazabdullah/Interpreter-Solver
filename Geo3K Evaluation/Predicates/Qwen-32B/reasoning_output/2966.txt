QUESTION: Find z in the given parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram, as indicated by the parallel sides.
  - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are the vertices of the parallelogram.
  - Point \(E\) lies on \(CB\), and point \(F\) lies on \(AD\). These points divide the sides into segments.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines \(CB\) and \(AD\) are parallel, and lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel.
  - The segments \(CE\) and \(BF\) are marked with expressions involving \(z\):
    - \(CE = 3z - 4\)
    - \(BF = z + 5\)

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - The lengths of segments \(CE\) and \(BF\) are given as algebraic expressions.
  - The diagram suggests that \(E\) and \(F\) are not necessarily midpoints but are points dividing the sides into specific ratios.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length:
    - \(AB = CD\)
    - \(AD = BC\)
  - Opposite sides are parallel:
    - \(AB \parallel CD\)
    - \(AD \parallel BC\)

- **Relationship Between Segments**:
  - Since \(E\) and \(F\) lie on the sides of the parallelogram, the segments \(CE\) and \(BF\) are parts of the sides \(CB\) and \(AD\), respectively.
  - The expressions \(3z - 4\) and \(z + 5\) indicate that the lengths of these segments are related to the variable \(z\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The lengths of the segments are given as:
    - \(CE = 3z - 4\)
    - \(BF = z + 5\)
  - These expressions suggest that the problem involves solving for \(z\) based on the properties of the parallelogram.

- **Implications**:
  - Since \(AD = BC\) (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal), the total lengths of the sides can be expressed in terms of \(z\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(z\).
- To solve for \(z\), we need to use the properties of the parallelogram, specifically the equality of opposite sides.
- The key is to set up an equation relating the segments \(CE\) and \(BF\) to the total lengths of the sides \(CB\) and \(AD\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, its sides, and the segment lengths using predicates.
- The predicates should capture the relationships between the segments and the sides of the parallelogram.
- We will not include the solution for \(z\) but will represent the given information and relationships.
