### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points labeled: \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Lines: \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \).

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations:**
  - Side \( BC \) is labeled as 12 units.
  - Angle \( \angle CAB \) is marked as 45°.
  - There is a right angle symbol at \( \angle ABC \), indicating \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol at \( \angle ABC \) indicates that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.
  - The 45° angle at \( \angle CAB \) suggests specific properties related to the triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \angle CAB = 45^\circ \), implying \( \angle ACB = 45^\circ \) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \)).
  - Therefore, \( \triangle ABC \) is a 45-45-90 triangle, which has specific side-length ratios: \( 1 : 1 : \sqrt{2} \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are congruent, and the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of each leg.
  - Here, \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs, and \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( BC = 12 \) units.
  - \( \angle CAB = 45^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal.
  - The hypotenuse \( AC \) is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of either leg.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the length of \( y \), which corresponds to the hypotenuse \( AC \) of the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The properties of a 45-45-90 triangle are crucial here.
  - The hypotenuse \( AC \) is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of either leg (\( AB \) or \( BC \)).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and its properties.
  - Indicate the right angle and the 45° angles.
  - Specify the lengths of the sides and their relationships.
  - Ensure all visible constraints are captured.
