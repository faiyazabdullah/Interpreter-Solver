STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2858
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x in the figure.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image contains a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a smaller triangle \( \triangle ADE \) within \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CA \), \( AD \), \( DE \), and \( EC \) are present.

- **Angles and Measurements**:
  - \( \angle BAC = (3x - 15)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BDA = 68^\circ \).
  - \( \angle EAD = 2x^\circ \).
  - \( \angle DEC = y^2^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No explicit indications of parallel lines, perpendicular lines, or congruent sides are visible.
  - The problem focuses on angle relationships.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is the main triangle.
  - \( \triangle ADE \) is an internal triangle formed by connecting points \( A \), \( D \), and \( E \).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - \( \angle BDA \) is an external angle to \( \triangle ADE \).
  - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

- **Variables**:
  - The problem involves solving for \( x \) using the given angle expressions.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle BDA = 68^\circ \) (a fixed angle).
  - \( \angle EAD = 2x^\circ \) (depends on \( x \)).
  - \( \angle BAC = (3x - 15)^\circ \) (depends on \( x \)).
  - \( \angle DEC = y^2^\circ \) (depends on \( y \), but \( y \) is not the focus here).

- **Key Relationships**:
  - In \( \triangle ADE \), the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BDA \) is the external angle to \( \triangle ADE \), so it equals the sum of the non-adjacent interior angles of \( \triangle ADE \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the relationship between the external angle \( \angle BDA \) and the interior angles of \( \triangle ADE \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The key predicate will involve the external angle theorem applied to \( \triangle ADE \).
