REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle with center \( E \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( AB \) and \( BC \) form a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Arcs \( \widehat{AC} \) and \( \widehat{ADC} \) are part of the circle.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - The minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is labeled as \( x \).
  - The major arc \( \widehat{ADC} \) is labeled as \( y \).
  - The measure of \( \angle ABC \) is given as \( 70^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional special markings like right angles or congruence symbols are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) lie on the same circle, making them concyclic.
  - \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( \widehat{AC} \).
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, \( \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } \widehat{AC} \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The sum of the measures of the minor and major arcs \( \widehat{AC} \) and \( \widehat{ADC} \) is \( 360^\circ \). That is, \( x + y = 360 \).
  - The relationship between the inscribed angle and the intercepted arc is \( \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2}x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( m\angle ABC = 70^\circ \).

- **Interpretation of Measurements:**
  - Since \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle, it is related to the arc \( \widehat{AC} \) by the formula \( \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2}x \).
  - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \), so \( x + y = 360 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the measure of the minor arc \( \widehat{AC} \), denoted as \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
  - The sum of the minor and major arcs is \( 360^\circ \).

- **Information Needed:**
  - Use the given \( m\angle ABC = 70^\circ \) and the relationship \( \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2}x \) to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, points, lines, and arcs.
  - Capture the relationship between the inscribed angle and the intercepted arc.
  - Represent the sum of the minor and major arcs.

- **Ensuring Completeness:**
  - All visible relationships and constraints are captured without directly solving for \( x \).
