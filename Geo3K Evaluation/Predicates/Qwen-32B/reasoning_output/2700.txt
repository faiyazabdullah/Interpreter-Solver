REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure consists of a rectangle \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
  - There is a right triangle \(ABC\) within the rectangle, where \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - \(AB\) and \(BC\) are sides of the rectangle.
  - \(AC\) is a diagonal of the rectangle and also the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(ABC\).
  - \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\).
  - \(\angle ACB = 30^\circ\).

- **Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 15 \, \text{mm}\).
  - \(BC = 15 \, \text{mm}\).
  - \(AC = 30 \, \text{mm}\) (diagonal).

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol is present at \(\angle ABC\).
  - The angle \(\angle ACB\) is marked as \(30^\circ\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships**:
  - \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.
  - \(AB\) and \(BC\) are perpendicular (\(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\)).
  - \(AC\) is both a diagonal of the rectangle and the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(ABC\).
  - In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle ACB = 30^\circ\) implies it is a 30-60-90 triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 15 \, \text{mm}\): One side of the rectangle and one leg of the right triangle.
  - \(BC = 15 \, \text{mm}\): Another side of the rectangle and the other leg of the right triangle.
  - \(AC = 30 \, \text{mm}\): The diagonal of the rectangle and the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

- **Implications**:
  - Since \(AB = BC\), the rectangle is actually a square.
  - The diagonal \(AC\) of a square with side length \(s\) is given by \(s\sqrt{2}\). Here, \(s = 15 \, \text{mm}\), so \(AC = 15\sqrt{2} \, \text{mm}\). However, the given \(AC = 30 \, \text{mm}\) suggests the use of trigonometry in the context of the 30-60-90 triangle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks for the area of the figure, which is a square \(ABCD\).

- **Relevant Properties**:
  - The area of a square is given by \(s^2\), where \(s\) is the side length.
  - From the image, \(s = 15 \, \text{mm}\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the square and its properties.
  - Indicate the side lengths and the diagonal.
  - Use the given angle and trigonometric relationships if necessary.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are captured.
