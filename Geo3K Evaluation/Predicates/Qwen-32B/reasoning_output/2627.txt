REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is depicted with center \( B \).
  - Points \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Chords \( RS \), \( ST \), and \( TR \) are drawn within the circle.
  - Angles \( \angle RSB \) and \( \angle BST \) are labeled as \( x^\circ \) and \( 2x^\circ \), respectively.

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( \angle RSB = x^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BST = 2x^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence symbols are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \) are points on the circumference, the chords \( RS \), \( ST \), and \( TR \) are part of the circle.
  - \( B \) is the center of the circle, so \( BR \), \( BS \), and \( BT \) are radii of the circle.
  - The angles \( \angle RSB \) and \( \angle BST \) are subtended by the chords \( RS \) and \( ST \), respectively, from the center \( B \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle RSB = x^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BST = 2x^\circ \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - The sum of the central angles around point \( B \) must equal \( 360^\circ \). Therefore, we need to account for all central angles formed by the chords.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The sum of the central angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The angles \( \angle RSB \) and \( \angle BST \) are given as \( x^\circ \) and \( 2x^\circ \), respectively. We need to use the fact that the remaining angle \( \angle TRS \) must complete the full \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle, its center, and the points on the circumference.
  - Specify the angles and their measures.
  - Use the property that the sum of central angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
