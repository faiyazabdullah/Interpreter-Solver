================================================================================
QUESTION: Find P S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Triangle \( \triangle SPQ \) is shown.
  - Point \( R \) lies on the base \( SQ \).
  - Point \( P \) is above the base \( SQ \).
  - Line segment \( PR \) is perpendicular to \( SQ \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( SP \), \( PQ \), \( SQ \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - \( PR \) is the altitude from \( P \) to the base \( SQ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The base \( SQ \) is divided into two equal segments: \( SR = 7 \) and \( RQ = 7 \).
  - The hypotenuse \( PQ = 9 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( \angle PRQ \) is marked as a right angle (\(\perp\)).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle SPR \) and \( \triangle PQR \) are right triangles sharing the common altitude \( PR \).
  - \( R \) is the midpoint of \( SQ \) because \( SR = RQ = 7 \).
  - \( PR \) is the altitude of \( \triangle SPQ \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - \( \triangle SPQ \) is isosceles because \( SR = RQ \).
  - \( PR \) is perpendicular to \( SQ \), making \( PR \) the altitude and median of \( \triangle SPQ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( SR = 7 \)
  - \( RQ = 7 \)
  - \( PQ = 9 \)
  - \( SQ = SR + RQ = 7 + 7 = 14 \)

- **Implications**:
  - Since \( PR \) is the altitude, it splits \( \triangle SPQ \) into two congruent right triangles \( \triangle SPR \) and \( \triangle PQR \).
  - The length of \( PS \) can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle SPR \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( PS \).
- To find \( PS \), we use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle SPR \):
  \[
  PS^2 = PR^2 + SR^2
  \]
- We need to determine \( PR \) first, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle PQR \):
  \[
  PQ^2 = PR^2 + RQ^2
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Predicates must represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements.
- Ensure all relationships are atomic and do not directly solve the problem.
