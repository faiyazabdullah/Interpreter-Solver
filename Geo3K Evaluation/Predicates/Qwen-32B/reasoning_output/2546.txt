================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded sector. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a **circle** with center \( X \).
  - There are three points on the circumference of the circle: \( W \), \( Y \), and another unnamed point.
  - The shaded region is a **sector** of the circle.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - \( XW \), \( XY \), and \( YW \) are radii of the circle.
  - The central angle \( \angle WXY \) is marked as \( 52^\circ \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The radius of the circle is given as \( 2 \) cm.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The shaded region is highlighted, indicating it is the focus of the problem.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships:**
  - \( XW \), \( XY \), and \( YW \) are radii of the circle, so they are congruent.
  - The shaded region is a sector of the circle with the central angle \( \angle WXY = 52^\circ \).
  - The radius of the circle is constant throughout.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - Radius of the circle: \( 2 \) cm.
  - Central angle of the sector: \( 52^\circ \).

- **Relevant Relationships:**
  - The area of a sector of a circle is proportional to its central angle.
  - The formula for the area of a sector is:
    \[
    \text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
    \]
    where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees and \( r \) is the radius.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the area of the shaded sector.
  
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The area of a sector depends on the central angle and the radius of the circle.
  - The radius is given as \( 2 \) cm, and the central angle is \( 52^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle, its center, and points on the circumference.
  - Specify the radius and the central angle.
  - Indicate the shaded sector.
  
- **Completeness Check:**
  - All visible information is captured, including the radius and the central angle.
  - The relationships between the circle, its radii, and the sector are clearly represented.
