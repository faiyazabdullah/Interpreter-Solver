STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2521
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x for the equilateral triangle R S T if R S = x + 9, S T = 2 x, and R T = 3 x - 9.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a triangle with vertices labeled \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).
  - The triangle is labeled as \( \triangle RST \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The sides of the triangle are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( RS = x + 9 \)
    - \( ST = 2x \)
    - \( RT = 3x - 9 \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - There are no special markings such as right angles, congruence marks, or parallel lines.
  - The triangle is explicitly stated to be equilateral in the problem statement.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Equilateral Triangle Properties**:
  - In an equilateral triangle, all three sides are equal in length.
  - Therefore, \( RS = ST = RT \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( RS = x + 9 \)
  - \( ST = 2x \)
  - \( RT = 3x - 9 \)

- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( \triangle RST \) is equilateral, we have:
    \[
    RS = ST = RT
    \]
    This implies:
    \[
    x + 9 = 2x = 3x - 9
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**:
  - The question asks us to find the value of \( x \) for which \( \triangle RST \) is equilateral.
  - To achieve this, we need to use the property that all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the triangle and its vertices.
  - Indicate that the triangle is equilateral.
  - Express the side lengths in terms of \( x \).
  - Capture the equality of the side lengths.
