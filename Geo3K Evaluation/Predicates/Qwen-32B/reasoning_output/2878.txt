STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2878
================================================================================

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains four labeled points: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
- **Lines**: 
  - Line segment \( AD \) is drawn horizontally.
  - Line segment \( BC \) intersects \( AD \) at point \( C \).
  - Line segment \( AB \) extends from \( A \) to \( B \).
- **Angles**: 
  - Two angles are marked as \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) at point \( C \).
  - \( \angle 2 \) is explicitly labeled with a measure of \( 67^\circ \).
- **Special Markings**: No additional markings such as right angles, congruence, or parallel lines are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Linear Pair**: \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) form a linear pair because they are adjacent angles whose non-common sides form a straight line (\( AD \)).
- **Supplementary Angles**: Since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) form a linear pair, their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**: \( m\angle 2 = 67^\circ \).
- **Relationship**: The sum of the measures of \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 1 \).
- Using the property of linear pairs, we know:
  \[
  m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substituting \( m\angle 2 = 67^\circ \):
  \[
  m\angle 1 + 67^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
- Solving for \( m\angle 1 \):
  \[
  m\angle 1 = 180^\circ - 67^\circ = 113^\circ
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the geometric elements and their relationships using the provided predicate format.
- Ensure all visible information is captured, including the linear pair relationship and the given angle measure.
