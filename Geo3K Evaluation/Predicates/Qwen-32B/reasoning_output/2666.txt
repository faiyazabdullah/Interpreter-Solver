================================================================================
QUESTION: E B \parallel D C. Find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a large triangle \( \triangle GAB \) with vertices \( G \), \( A \), and \( B \).
  - Inside this triangle, there is a smaller triangle \( \triangle EDB \) with vertices \( E \), \( D \), and \( B \).
  - Additional points \( F \) and \( C \) are present, forming additional segments and parallelograms.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( GB = 10 \)
  - \( ED = 4 \)
  - \( DC = 5 \)
  - \( AB = x - 2 \)
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - Right-angle symbols are present at \( \angle GAB \), \( \angle EDB \), and \( \angle FDE \).
  - Parallel lines are indicated: \( EB \parallel DC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines:**
  - \( EB \parallel DC \) implies that \( \triangle EDB \) and \( \triangle GAB \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion because corresponding angles are equal.
  
- **Right Angles:**
  - \( \angle GAB \), \( \angle EDB \), and \( \angle FDE \) are right angles, indicating that both \( \triangle GAB \) and \( \triangle EDB \) are right triangles.
  
- **Similar Triangles:**
  - Since \( EB \parallel DC \) and both triangles share the same angles, \( \triangle EDB \sim \triangle GAB \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( GB = 10 \)
  - \( ED = 4 \)
  - \( DC = 5 \)
  - \( AB = x - 2 \)
  
- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( \triangle EDB \sim \triangle GAB \), the ratio of corresponding sides must be equal. Specifically:
    \[
    \frac{ED}{GB} = \frac{EB}{AB}
    \]
  - We know \( ED = 4 \) and \( GB = 10 \), so the similarity ratio is \( \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of \( AB \), given that \( EB \parallel DC \).
- Using the similarity of triangles \( \triangle EDB \) and \( \triangle GAB \), we can set up a proportion involving the lengths of corresponding sides.
- The key is to use the similarity ratio and the given measurements to solve for \( AB \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements in the form of predicates.
- Predicates will include the shapes, lines, angles, parallel relationships, and measurements.
- We will avoid directly stating the solution but ensure all necessary information is represented.
