REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains multiple triangles: \( \triangle PRQ \), \( \triangle PST \), and \( \triangle RST \).
  - Key points: \( P, T, R, S, Q \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( PT \) is a vertical segment.
  - \( RS \) is a horizontal segment.
  - \( SQ \) is a horizontal segment.
  - \( PQ \) is a hypotenuse of \( \triangle PRQ \).
  - \( RT \) and \( ST \) form the legs of \( \triangle PST \).
  - \( RS \) and \( ST \) form the legs of \( \triangle RST \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( RS = 10 \).
  - \( SQ = 5 \).
  - \( PQ = 25 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols at \( \angle PRS \) and \( \angle PST \), indicating \( \triangle PRS \) and \( \triangle PST \) are right triangles.
  - The triangles \( \triangle PRS \) and \( \triangle PST \) share the common side \( PS \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle PRS \) and \( \triangle PST \) are right triangles.
  - \( \triangle PST \) is similar to \( \triangle PRQ \) because they share the same angles (both are right triangles with a common angle at \( P \)).
  - \( PT \) is the vertical leg of \( \triangle PST \).
  - \( RS \) and \( SQ \) are horizontal segments forming part of the base of \( \triangle PRQ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( RS = 10 \).
  - \( SQ = 5 \).
  - \( PQ = 25 \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( \triangle PST \) is similar to \( \triangle PRQ \), the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
  - \( PS \) is the sum of \( RS \) and \( SQ \): \( PS = RS + SQ = 10 + 5 = 15 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( PT \).
- To find \( PT \), we use the similarity of \( \triangle PST \) and \( \triangle PRQ \):
  - The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal. Specifically, \( \frac{PT}{PR} = \frac{PS}{PQ} \).
  - We need to determine \( PR \) using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle PRQ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all visible geometric shapes, points, lines, and relationships.
- Use the similarity of triangles and the Pythagorean theorem to plan the necessary predicates.
