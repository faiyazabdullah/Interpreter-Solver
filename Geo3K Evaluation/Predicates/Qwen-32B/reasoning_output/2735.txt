QUESTION: Find the area of the trapezoid.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The figure is a trapezoid with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \).
- **Points**: The vertices are \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \). The point \( E \) is the intersection of the height from \( C \) to \( AD \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the trapezoid are \( AB, BC, CD, \) and \( DA \). The height is drawn from \( C \) to \( AD \) at point \( E \).
- **Angles**: The height \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( AD \), forming right angles at \( E \).
- **Measurements**:
  - The length of the longer base \( AD \) is 16 ft.
  - The length of the shorter base \( BC \) is 6 ft.
  - The height \( CE \) is 12 ft.
- **Special Markings**: The height \( CE \) is perpendicular to both bases \( AD \) and \( BC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Relationships**: The bases \( AD \) and \( BC \) are parallel.
- **Perpendicular Relationships**: The height \( CE \) is perpendicular to both \( AD \) and \( BC \).
- **Congruent Relationships**: Since \( CE \) is the height, it is congruent to the perpendicular distance from any point on \( BC \) to \( AD \).
- **Trapezoid Properties**: The figure satisfies the definition of a trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Length of the longer base \( AD = 16 \) ft.
  - Length of the shorter base \( BC = 6 \) ft.
  - Height \( CE = 12 \) ft.
- **What Measurements Represent**:
  - \( AD \) and \( BC \) are the lengths of the parallel bases.
  - \( CE \) is the perpendicular height between the two bases.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **area of the trapezoid**.
- The relevant formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
  \]
- Here, \( \text{Base}_1 = AD = 16 \) ft, \( \text{Base}_2 = BC = 6 \) ft, and \( \text{Height} = CE = 12 \) ft.
- The required information (bases and height) is fully provided in the diagram.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the trapezoid, its bases, height, and the relationships between them.
- Predicates should capture the parallelism of the bases, the perpendicularity of the height, and the measurements.
