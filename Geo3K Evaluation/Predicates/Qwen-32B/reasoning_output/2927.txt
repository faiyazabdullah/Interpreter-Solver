================================================================================

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: Image Analysis
- **Shapes Identified**: Two trapezoids are shown.
  - The left trapezoid is labeled \( J K L M \).
  - The right trapezoid is labeled \( Q R S T \).
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points \( J, K, L, M \) define trapezoid \( J K L M \).
  - Points \( Q, R, S, T \) define trapezoid \( Q R S T \).
  - Both trapezoids have parallel bases, indicated by the double parallel marks.
- **Measurements**:
  - The length of base \( J K \) is given as 5 ft.
  - The area of trapezoid \( J K L M \) is 138 square feet.
  - The area of trapezoid \( Q R S T \) is 5.52 square feet.
- **Special Markings**:
  - The trapezoids are similar (\( J K L M \sim Q R S T \)), as stated in the problem.

#### STEP 2: Relationship Identification
- **Similarity**:
  - Since \( J K L M \sim Q R S T \), the corresponding sides of the trapezoids are proportional.
  - The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
- **Parallel Bases**:
  - In both trapezoids, the bases are parallel (\( J M \parallel K L \) and \( Q T \parallel R S \)).
- **Corresponding Sides**:
  - The bases \( J K \) and \( Q R \) correspond, as do the bases \( M L \) and \( T S \).

#### STEP 3: Measurement Analysis
- **Given Measurements**:
  - Length of \( J K = 5 \) ft.
  - Area of \( J K L M = 138 \) square feet.
  - Area of \( Q R S T = 5.52 \) square feet.
- **Inferred Relationships**:
  - Let the length of \( Q R \) be \( x \).
  - The ratio of the areas of the trapezoids is \( \frac{138}{5.52} \).
  - The ratio of the corresponding side lengths is the square root of the area ratio.

#### STEP 4: Question Analysis
- The question asks us to find the value of \( x \), the length of base \( Q R \).
- To solve this, we use the property of similar figures: the ratio of the areas of two similar trapezoids is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

#### STEP 5: Predicate Planning
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Predicates will capture the similarity, areas, and side lengths without directly solving for \( x \).
