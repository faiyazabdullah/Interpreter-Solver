REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle with center \( B \).
  - Points \( A, C, V, W, X, Y, Z \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( AW, CX, YZ \) are secants to the circle.
  - Arcs \( \widehat{YZ} \) and \( \widehat{WX} \) are indicated.
  
- **Visible Measurements:**
  - The measure of \( \angle YBX \) is \( 96^\circ \).
  - The measure of \( \angle WBX \) is \( 49^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence are noted.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Points \( A, C, V, W, X, Y, Z \) lie on the circumference of the same circle, making them concyclic.
  - \( \angle YBX \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( \widehat{YX} \).
  - \( \angle WBX \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( \widehat{WX} \).
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
  - The total measure of arc \( \widehat{YZ} \) is related to the given angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle YBX = 96^\circ \)
  - \( \angle WBX = 49^\circ \)
  
- **Interpretation of Measurements:**
  - Since \( \angle YBX \) and \( \angle WBX \) are inscribed angles, their measures are half the measures of their respective intercepted arcs.
  - Arc \( \widehat{YX} \) is part of the larger arc \( \widehat{YZ} \), and the measure of \( \widehat{YZ} \) can be found by considering the total circle (360Â°) minus other known arcs.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - The problem asks for the measure of arc \( \widehat{YXZ} \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
  - The sum of the measures of arcs around a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The measure of \( \widehat{YXZ} \) can be determined by subtracting the measures of other arcs from the total circle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Indicate the points on the circle.
  - Relate the angles to their intercepted arcs.
  - Use the properties of inscribed angles and the total circle to find the measure of \( \widehat{YXZ} \).
