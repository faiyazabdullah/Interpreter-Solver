STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2648
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the value of x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is present with center \( A \).
  - Several points are marked on the circumference: \( B, C, D, E, F \).

- **Lines and Chords**:
  - Lines \( AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, BC, CD, DE, EF, FB \) are drawn.
  - Line \( BC \) is a chord of the circle.
  - Line \( DE \) is a vertical diameter of the circle, passing through the center \( A \).

- **Angles**:
  - An angle \( \angle CAB \) is marked with a measurement of \( 67^\circ \).
  - Another angle \( \angle BAF \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle BAE \), indicating \( \angle BAE = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties**:
  - \( AB, AC, AD, AE, AF \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( DE \) is a diameter of the circle, so \( \angle DBE \) and \( \angle DCE \) are right angles (by the inscribed angle theorem).
  - \( \angle BAE = 90^\circ \) because \( DE \) is a diameter.

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - Since \( DE \) is a diameter, \( \angle BAE = 90^\circ \).
  - The angle \( \angle BAF \) is part of the larger right angle \( \angle BAE \).
  - Therefore, \( \angle BAF = x^\circ \) is the complement of \( \angle CAB \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle CAB = 67^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BAE = 90^\circ \).

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \( \angle BAE = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle BAE = \angle BAF + \angle CAB \), we have:
    \[
    x + 67^\circ = 90^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- From the analysis, \( x \) is the complement of \( \angle CAB \) within the right angle \( \angle BAE \).
- The relevant geometric property is the sum of angles forming a right angle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, its center, and points on the circumference.
- Capture the right angle at \( \angle BAE \).
- Represent the given angle \( \angle CAB = 67^\circ \).
- Ensure the relationship \( x + 67^\circ = 90^\circ \) is captured through angle addition.
