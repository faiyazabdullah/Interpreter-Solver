REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are labeled as the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segment \( AB \) is one side of the triangle.
  - Line segment \( BC \) is another side of the triangle.
  - Line segment \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - Line segment \( x \) is the horizontal side of the triangle, connecting points \( B \) and \( C \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The hypotenuse \( AC \) is labeled as 16 units.
  - The vertical side \( BC \) is labeled as 4 units.

- **Angles:**
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( C \), indicating that \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse, and \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - The sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular to each other.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Hypotenuse \( AC = 16 \) units.
  - Vertical leg \( BC = 4 \) units.
  - Horizontal leg \( x \) is the unknown we need to find.

- **Implications:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to right triangles: \( AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2 \).
  - Here, \( AB = x \), \( BC = 4 \), and \( AC = 16 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \), the length of the horizontal side \( AB \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem is the primary property needed to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent:**
  - The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) and its vertices.
  - The right angle at \( C \).
  - The lengths of the sides \( AC \), \( BC \), and \( AB \).
  - The relationship between the sides using the Pythagorean theorem.
