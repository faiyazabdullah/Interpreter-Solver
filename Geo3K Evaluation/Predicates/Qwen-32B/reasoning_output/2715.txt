================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - The diagonals \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersect at point \( E \).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - The sides of the quadrilateral are represented by lines \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), and \( DA \).
  - Angles are labeled at the vertices:
    - \( \angle A = (x - 8)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle B = \frac{1}{2} y^\circ \)
    - \( \angle C = (x - 12)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle D = (3y - 4)^\circ \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - None explicitly indicate parallelism, perpendicularity, or congruence. However, the problem asks us to find \( x \) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - For the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, opposite sides must be parallel, and opposite angles must be equal.
  - This implies:
    - \( \angle A = \angle C \)
    - \( \angle B = \angle D \)

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle A = (x - 8)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = \frac{1}{2} y^\circ \)
  - \( \angle C = (x - 12)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle D = (3y - 4)^\circ \)

- **Relationships**:
  - Since the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, we use the property that opposite angles are equal:
    - \( \angle A = \angle C \)
    - \( \angle B = \angle D \)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find \( x \) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- To solve this, we use the property that opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal:
  - \( \angle A = \angle C \)
  - \( \angle B = \angle D \)

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the relationships between the angles and the conditions for the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.
- Predicates will capture the equality of opposite angles and the general structure of the quadrilateral.
