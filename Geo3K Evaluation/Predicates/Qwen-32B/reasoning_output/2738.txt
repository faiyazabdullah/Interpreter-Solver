REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a right triangle \( \triangle LIJ \).
  - There is a rectangle formed by points \( L, I, J, K \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - Line \( LJ \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle LIJ \) and has a length of 13.
  - Line \( IK \) is one side of the rectangle and has a length of 5.
  - Line \( LK \) is the base of the rectangle and has a length of 12.
  - Line \( IJ \) is the vertical side of the rectangle.

- **Angles:**
  - There is a right angle at point \( I \) (indicated by the square symbol).
  - The angle \( \angle LIJ \) is the focus for calculating \( \tan L \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle at \( I \) indicates that \( \triangle LIJ \) is a right triangle.
  - The rectangle is defined by its sides being perpendicular.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle LIJ \) is a right triangle with \( \angle LIJ = 90^\circ \).
  - The rectangle \( LIJK \) has sides \( LK = 12 \) and \( IK = 5 \).
  - \( IJ \) is the vertical side of the rectangle and also a leg of the right triangle \( \triangle LIJ \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to \( \triangle LIJ \): \( LJ^2 = LI^2 + IJ^2 \).
  - The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Hypotenuse \( LJ = 13 \).
  - Base of the rectangle (adjacent side to \( \angle LIJ \)): \( LI = 12 \).
  - Vertical side of the rectangle (opposite side to \( \angle LIJ \)): \( IJ = 5 \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - In \( \triangle LIJ \):
    - \( LI \) is the adjacent side to \( \angle LIJ \).
    - \( IJ \) is the opposite side to \( \angle LIJ \).
    - \( LJ \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - The question asks for the ratio of \( \tan L \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
  - \( \tan L = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{IJ}{LI} \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.
  - Here, \( \tan L = \frac{IJ}{LI} = \frac{5}{12} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and rectangle.
  - Define the right angle.
  - Specify the lengths of the sides.
  - Capture the relationship between the sides of the right triangle.
