REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Three circles are present, centered at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Points \( E \), \( X \), \( Y \), and \( D \) lie on the horizontal line passing through the centers of the circles.
  - Points \( Z \) and \( W \) are marked on the respective circles, indicating specific segments.

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Horizontal line passes through the centers \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - Segments \( AZ \) and \( CW \) are drawn from the centers of the circles to points on their circumferences.

- **Labels and Measurements:**
  - The diameters of the circles are given:
    - Diameter of \( \odot A \): 10 units.
    - Diameter of \( \odot B \): 30 units.
    - Diameter of \( \odot C \): 10 units.
  - It is stated that \( AZ \cong CW \) and \( CW = 2 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings (e.g., right angles, parallel lines) are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Circles:**
  - The circles are tangent to each other externally, as they do not overlap and are touching at points.
  - The horizontal line passing through the centers \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) is the common axis for all three circles.

- **Relationships Between Segments:**
  - \( AZ \) and \( CW \) are radii of their respective circles.
  - Since \( AZ \cong CW \) and \( CW = 2 \), it follows that \( AZ = 2 \).

- **Constraints Implied:**
  - The centers \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are collinear along the horizontal line.
  - The distances between the centers are determined by the diameters of the circles plus the radii involved.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Diameter of \( \odot A \): 10 units → Radius of \( \odot A \): \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) units.
  - Diameter of \( \odot B \): 30 units → Radius of \( \odot B \): \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) units.
  - Diameter of \( \odot C \): 10 units → Radius of \( \odot C \): \( \frac{10}{2} = 5 \) units.
  - \( AZ = CW = 2 \) units.

- **Implications:**
  - The total distance between the leftmost point of \( \odot A \) and the rightmost point of \( \odot C \) is the sum of the radii and the diameters of the circles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Find the distance \( AC \), where \( A \) and \( C \) are the centers of the leftmost and rightmost circles, respectively.

- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The distance \( AC \) is the sum of the following segments:
    1. The radius of \( \odot A \) (from \( A \) to the point of tangency with \( \odot B \)).
    2. The diameter of \( \odot B \).
    3. The radius of \( \odot C \) (from the point of tangency with \( \odot B \) to \( C \)).

- **Information Needed:**
  - Radii and diameters of the circles.
  - The fact that \( AZ \cong CW \) and \( CW = 2 \) helps confirm the radii calculations.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Define the circles, their centers, and the points involved.
  
- **Predicates for Measurements:**
  - Specify the diameters and radii of the circles.
  - Indicate the lengths of segments \( AZ \) and \( CW \).

- **Predicates for Relationships:**
  - Use congruence and equality to express the relationship \( AZ \cong CW \).
  - Use the collinearity of points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

- **Completeness Check:**
  - Ensure all visible relationships and measurements are represented.
  - Avoid deriving the final answer; focus on the given information and constraints.
