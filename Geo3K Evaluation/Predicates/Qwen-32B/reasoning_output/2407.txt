REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image shows a hexagon with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D, E, F \).
  - The hexagon has labeled angles at each vertex: 
    - \( \angle A = (x - 6)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle B = (x + 4)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle C = x^\circ \)
    - \( \angle D = 56^\circ \)
    - \( \angle E = (x + 10)^\circ \)
    - \( \angle F \) is not explicitly labeled but is part of the hexagon.

- **Visible Measurements**:
  - Angles at vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) are expressed in terms of \( x \).
  - One angle (\( \angle D \)) is explicitly given as \( 56^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No special markings (e.g., parallel, perpendicular, congruence) are visible apart from the labeled angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The figure is a hexagon, so it has six sides and six interior angles.
  - The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is given by the formula:
    \[
    \text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ = (6-2) \times 180^\circ = 720^\circ
    \]
  - The angles at vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) must add up to \( 720^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle A = (x - 6)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = (x + 4)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle C = x^\circ \)
  - \( \angle D = 56^\circ \)
  - \( \angle E = (x + 10)^\circ \)
  - \( \angle F \) is unknown but part of the hexagon.

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - The sum of the interior angles of the hexagon is:
    \[
    (x - 6) + (x + 4) + x + 56 + (x + 10) + \angle F = 720^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks for the value of \( x \).
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is \( 720^\circ \).
  - All angles are expressed in terms of \( x \) except \( \angle D \), which is explicitly given.
- **Information Needed**:
  - Use the sum of the interior angles to set up an equation involving \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the hexagon and its vertices.
  - Represent the angles at each vertex.
  - Use the property that the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is \( 720^\circ \).
  - Avoid directly solving for \( x \) but ensure all relationships are captured.
