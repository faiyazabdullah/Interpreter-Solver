================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure consists of a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - Segment \( AB \) is labeled with a length of 7.
  - Segment \( BC \) is labeled with an angle of \( 30^\circ \).
  - Segment \( AC \) is labeled with the variable \( x \).

- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( A \), indicated by the right angle symbol.
  - An angle of \( 30^\circ \) is marked at vertex \( B \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The right angle at \( A \) indicates that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.
  - The \( 30^\circ \) angle at \( B \) suggests that \( \triangle ABC \) could be a \( 30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - The angle at \( B \) is \( 30^\circ \), and the angle at \( C \) must be \( 60^\circ \) because the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)) is half the length of the hypotenuse (\( BC \)) in a \( 30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The side \( AB \) is given as 7.
  - The hypotenuse \( BC \) is related to \( AB \) by the property of the \( 30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle.
  - The side \( AC \) is the remaining side, which we need to find.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 7 \) (opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle).
  - \( \angle B = 30^\circ \).
  - \( \angle A = 90^\circ \).

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a \( 30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle:
    - The hypotenuse \( BC \) is twice the length of the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle (\( AB \)).
    - The side \( AC \) (opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle) is \( AB \sqrt{3} \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of side \( AC \).
- To find \( x \), we use the properties of the \( 30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle:
  - \( AC = AB \sqrt{3} \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the triangle, its angles, the given lengths, and the relationships between the sides.
- The predicates should capture the right triangle property, the \( 30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ \) triangle properties, and the given measurements.
