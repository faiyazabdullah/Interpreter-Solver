REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle PMN \).
  - Points labeled: \( P \), \( M \), \( N \).
  - Line segments: \( PM \), \( MN \), \( PN \).

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - \( PM = 36 \) (horizontal side).
  - \( PN = 15 \) (vertical side).
  - Hypotenuse \( MN = 39 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at point \( P \), indicating \( \angle MPN = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle PMN \) is a right triangle because \( \angle MPN = 90^\circ \).
  - The sides \( PM \), \( PN \), and \( MN \) form the legs and hypotenuse of the right triangle.
  - The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( PM = 36 \) (adjacent to \( \angle M \)).
  - \( PN = 15 \) (opposite to \( \angle M \)).
  - \( MN = 39 \) (hypotenuse).

- **Relevant Properties:**
  - In \( \triangle PMN \), \( PM \) and \( PN \) are the legs, and \( MN \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The tangent of \( \angle M \) is given by \( \tan M = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{PN}{PM} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks for the ratio of \( \tan M \) as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
  - To find \( \tan M \), we use the formula \( \tan M = \frac{PN}{PM} \).
  - We need to compute \( \frac{PN}{PM} = \frac{15}{36} \) and round it to two decimal places.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the right triangle and its sides.
  - Indicate the right angle.
  - Define the lengths of the sides.
  - Ensure all geometric relationships are captured.
