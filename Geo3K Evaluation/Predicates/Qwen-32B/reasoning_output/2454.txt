### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of the triangle.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AB \) is the horizontal side of the triangle.
  - \( BC \) is the vertical side of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( A \) (indicated by the square symbol).
  - The angle at vertex \( B \) is given as \( 17^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The hypotenuse \( AC \) has a length of \( 9.7 \) units.
  - The variable \( x \) represents the length of side \( AB \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - Side \( AB \) is adjacent to the \( 17^\circ \) angle.
  - Side \( AC \) is the hypotenuse.
  - Side \( BC \) is opposite the \( 17^\circ \) angle.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies since it is a right triangle.
  - Trigonometric relationships involving sine, cosine, and tangent can be used due to the known angle and hypotenuse.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AC = 9.7 \) (hypotenuse).
  - \( \angle ABC = 17^\circ \).
  - \( x \) represents the length of \( AB \).

- **What Measurements Represent**:
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
  - \( AB \) is the adjacent side to the \( 17^\circ \) angle.
  - \( BC \) is the opposite side to the \( 17^\circ \) angle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the length of side \( AB \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The cosine function relates the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle:
    \[
    \cos(17^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{x}{9.7}
    \]

- **Information Needed**:
  - The length of the hypotenuse \( AC = 9.7 \).
  - The angle \( \angle ABC = 17^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the right triangle and its components.
  - Define the right angle and the given angle.
  - Specify the lengths of the sides, including the hypotenuse.
  - Capture the trigonometric relationship using cosine.
