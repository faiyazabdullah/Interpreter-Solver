QUESTION: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The main shape is a parallelogram with vertices labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - There is a right triangle formed within the parallelogram involving points \( D \), \( E \), and \( B \).

- **Points, Lines, and Angles**:
  - Points: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \).
  - Lines: \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( DA \), \( DB \), \( BE \).
  - Angles: \( \angle DBE = 60^\circ \), \( \angle DEB = 90^\circ \) (right angle).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 16 \) ft.
  - \( DC = 23 \) ft.
  - \( DE \) is the height from \( D \) to \( BE \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( BE \) is perpendicular to \( DE \), indicating \( \angle DEB = 90^\circ \).
  - \( DB \) is one side of the right triangle \( \triangle DBE \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallelogram Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \( AB = CD \) and \( AD = BC \).
  - Opposite sides are parallel: \( AB \parallel CD \) and \( AD \parallel BC \).

- **Right Triangle Properties**:
  - In \( \triangle DBE \):
    - \( \angle DEB = 90^\circ \).
    - \( \angle DBE = 60^\circ \).
    - Therefore, \( \angle BDE = 30^\circ \) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \)).

- **Relationship Between Shapes**:
  - \( BE \) is the height dropped from \( D \) to \( AB \), forming the right triangle \( \triangle DBE \).
  - The height \( DE \) helps in understanding the dimensions of the parallelogram.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 16 \) ft.
  - \( DC = 23 \) ft.
  - \( \angle DBE = 60^\circ \).

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \( AB = CD \) (opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal), we have \( AB = CD = 16 \) ft.
  - Similarly, \( AD = BC \). We need to find \( AD \) using the right triangle \( \triangle DBE \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the **perimeter** of the parallelogram.
- To find the perimeter, we need the lengths of all four sides of the parallelogram:
  - \( AB \) and \( CD \) are already known (\( AB = CD = 16 \) ft).
  - We need to determine \( AD \) and \( BC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using predicates.
- The predicates should capture the shape, angles, measurements, and relationships without directly solving for the perimeter.
