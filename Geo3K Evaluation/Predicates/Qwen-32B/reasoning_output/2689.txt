STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2689
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the perimeter of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure consists of a large rectangle with vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \).
  - Smaller rectangles or squares are formed within the larger rectangle, with specific dimensions labeled.

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The large rectangle has sides of length 5 units each.
  - Inside the rectangle, there are smaller rectangles/squares with dimensions labeled as 2 units.

- **Annotations**:
  - The top and bottom horizontal sides of the large rectangle are each divided into two segments of 2 units each.
  - The vertical sides of the large rectangle are also divided into segments, with one segment labeled as 2 units.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The large shape is a rectangle with vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \).
  - The smaller rectangles or squares inside the larger rectangle are aligned along the grid formed by the divisions.
  - The smaller shapes are aligned such that their sides are parallel to the sides of the large rectangle.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The large rectangle has equal opposite sides, consistent with the properties of a rectangle.
  - The smaller rectangles/squares have sides of 2 units, indicating they are likely squares due to the symmetry and labeling.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - The large rectangle has a width of 5 units and a height of 5 units.
  - The smaller internal shapes have sides of 2 units.

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The total width of the large rectangle is composed of two segments of 2 units each plus the middle segment.
  - Similarly, the total height is composed of two segments of 2 units each plus the middle segment.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The question asks for the perimeter of the entire figure.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by \( 2 \times (\text{width} + \text{height}) \).
  - Here, the width and height of the large rectangle are both 5 units.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the large rectangle and its dimensions.
  - Define the smaller internal shapes and their dimensions.
  - Capture the relationships between the shapes and their alignment.
  - Ensure all visible measurements and constraints are represented.
