STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2621
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find S T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle RST \).
  - The vertices of the triangle are labeled \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - The sides of the triangle are labeled with expressions involving \( x \):
    - \( RS = 4x - 4 \)
    - \( RT = 3x + 3 \)
    - \( ST = 12 + x \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - Two pink tick marks are shown on sides \( RS \) and \( RT \). These indicate that \( RS \) and \( RT \) are congruent.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Congruent Sides:**
  - The pink tick marks on \( RS \) and \( RT \) imply that \( RS \) is congruent to \( RT \). Therefore, \( \triangle RST \) is isosceles with \( RS = RT \).

- **Constraints:**
  - The expressions for the sides provide algebraic relationships that need to be satisfied.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values:**
  - The lengths of the sides are given as algebraic expressions:
    - \( RS = 4x - 4 \)
    - \( RT = 3x + 3 \)
    - \( ST = 12 + x \)

- **Relevant Relationships:**
  - Since \( RS = RT \), we have the equation:
    \[
    4x - 4 = 3x + 3
    \]

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the length of \( ST \), which is represented by the expression \( 12 + x \).
- To find \( ST \), we need to determine the value of \( x \) using the congruence condition \( RS = RT \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The key relationships are:
  1. \( \triangle RST \) is a triangle.
  2. \( RS = RT \) (congruence of sides).
  3. The side lengths are given by algebraic expressions.
