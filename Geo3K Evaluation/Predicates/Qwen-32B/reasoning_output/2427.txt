### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segment \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle and has a length of 5 units.
  - Line segment \( BC \) is one leg of the triangle and has a length denoted by \( x \).
  - Line segment \( CA \) is the other leg of the triangle and has a length of \( 3\sqrt{2} \).

- **Angles:**
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( B \), indicated by the square box at \( \angle ABC \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 5 \)
  - \( BC = x \)
  - \( CA = 3\sqrt{2} \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
  - \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.
  - \( BC \) and \( CA \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies: \( AB^2 = BC^2 + CA^2 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 5 \)
  - \( BC = x \)
  - \( CA = 3\sqrt{2} \)

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem:
    \[
    AB^2 = BC^2 + CA^2 \implies 5^2 = x^2 + (3\sqrt{2})^2
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of \( BC \).
- To find \( x \), we use the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the structure of the triangle, the right angle, the lengths of the sides, and the application of the Pythagorean theorem.
