REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**:  
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle JKL \).
  - Points \( J \), \( K \), and \( L \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Points and Lines**:  
  - \( J \), \( K \), and \( L \) are the vertices.
  - Line segments \( JK \), \( KL \), and \( JL \) form the sides of the triangle.
  
- **Visible Measurements**:  
  - \( JK = 14 \) units (hypotenuse).
  - \( KL = 9 \) units (one leg of the right triangle).
  
- **Special Markings**:  
  - A right angle symbol is marked at \( \angle LJK \), indicating \( \angle LJK = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:  
  - \( \triangle JKL \) is a right triangle with \( \angle LJK = 90^\circ \).
  - \( JK \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
  - \( KL \) and \( JL \) are the legs of the right triangle.
  
- **Constraints and Properties**:  
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies: \( JK^2 = JL^2 + KL^2 \).
  - \( \angle J \) is one of the acute angles in the right triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:  
  - \( JK = 14 \) (hypotenuse).
  - \( KL = 9 \) (one leg).
  - \( JL \) (the other leg) needs to be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
  
- **Relevant Measurements**:  
  - The question asks for the measure of \( \angle J \), which can be determined using trigonometric relationships once \( JL \) is known.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:  
  - The problem requires finding the measure of \( \angle J \) to the nearest degree.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:  
  - Since \( \triangle JKL \) is a right triangle, we can use trigonometric functions (e.g., sine, cosine, tangent) to find \( \angle J \).
  - First, calculate \( JL \) using the Pythagorean theorem.
  - Then, use the inverse tangent function (\( \tan^{-1} \)) to find \( \angle J \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:  
  - Represent the triangle and its properties.
  - Capture the right angle and side lengths.
  - Define the relationships between the sides and angles using trigonometric properties.
  
- **Completeness Check**:  
  - Ensure all visible information is represented.
  - Avoid including the final answer or intermediate calculations.
