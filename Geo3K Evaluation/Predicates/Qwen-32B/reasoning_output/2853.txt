STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2853
================================================================================
QUESTION: a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50, find \cos A.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points labeled: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \).
  - Additional point \( G \) is marked inside the triangle, but its specific role is not explicitly stated in the problem.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( Line(A, B) \): Hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - \( Line(B, C) \): Vertical leg of the triangle.
  - \( Line(C, A) \): Horizontal leg of the triangle.
  
- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BCA \) is a right angle, indicated by the right angle symbol at \( C \).
  - The question focuses on \( \angle CAB \), labeled as \( \angle A \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( a = 14 \): Length of the vertical leg \( BC \).
  - \( b = 48 \): Length of the horizontal leg \( CA \).
  - \( c = 50 \): Length of the hypotenuse \( AB \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCA = 90^\circ \).
  - The sides \( BC \), \( CA \), and \( AB \) form the legs and hypotenuse of the right triangle.
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies: \( BC^2 + CA^2 = AB^2 \).

- **Constraints:**
  - The lengths \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) satisfy the Pythagorean theorem: \( 14^2 + 48^2 = 50^2 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( BC = a = 14 \)
  - \( CA = b = 48 \)
  - \( AB = c = 50 \)

- **Relevant Relationships:**
  - The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is given by the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
  - For \( \angle A \):
    \[
    \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{CA}{AB} = \frac{b}{c}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( \cos A \).
- To find \( \cos A \), we use the definition of cosine in a right triangle:
  \[
  \cos A = \frac{CA}{AB} = \frac{b}{c}
  \]
- Substituting the given values:
  \[
  \cos A = \frac{48}{50} = \frac{24}{25}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, its sides, and the right angle.
- Include the given measurements and their relationships.
- Ensure all visible geometric constraints are captured.
