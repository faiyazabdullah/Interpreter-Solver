REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a smaller right triangle \( \triangle ABD \) formed within \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( AB \) is a vertical line segment with a length of 24 units.
  - \( AC \) is a horizontal line segment with a length of 12 units.
  - \( BD \) is a line segment with a length represented as \( t + 1 \).

- **Angles:**
  - There are right angles at \( \angle ABD \) and \( \angle ABC \), indicated by the red squares.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbols at \( B \) and \( D \) indicate that both \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle ABD \) are right triangles.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle ABD \) is also a right triangle with \( \angle ABD = 90^\circ \).
  - \( BD \) is a segment of \( BC \), and its length is given as \( t + 1 \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - Both triangles share the side \( AB \).
  - The hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABD \) is \( AD \), and the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \) is \( AC \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( AB = 24 \) units.
  - \( AC = 12 \) units.
  - \( BD = t + 1 \) units.

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Since \( \triangle ABD \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) (both are right triangles sharing \( \angle BAD \)), the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks us to find the value of the variable \( t \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The similarity of triangles \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) implies that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
  - Specifically, the ratio of the legs of the smaller triangle \( \triangle ABD \) to the larger triangle \( \triangle ABC \) must be consistent.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the triangles, lines, and angles.
  - Capture the right angles and the similarity of triangles.
  - Include the given measurements and the relationship between the segments.
