STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2411
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - There is a large circle containing two smaller circles.
  - The shaded region is the area of the large circle minus the combined areas of the two smaller circles.
  
- **Points and Labels**:
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are marked within the circles.
    - Point \( A \) is inside the top smaller circle.
    - Point \( C \) is inside the bottom smaller circle.
    - Point \( B \) is the center of the large circle and also the common center of the two smaller circles.

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - A vertical measurement of 20 units is indicated, which represents the diameter of the large circle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The two smaller circles are congruent and are tangent to each other at point \( B \).
  - The large circle contains both smaller circles completely.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships**:
  - The large circle has its center at \( B \).
  - The two smaller circles have their centers at \( A \) and \( C \), respectively, and are congruent.
  - The two smaller circles are tangent to each other at point \( B \).
  - The shaded region is the area of the large circle minus the areas of the two smaller circles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - The diameter of the large circle is 20 units.
  - Since the two smaller circles are congruent and tangent to each other at the center \( B \) of the large circle, the diameter of each smaller circle is half the diameter of the large circle, i.e., 10 units.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked?**
  - The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The area of a circle is given by \( \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius.
  - The radius of the large circle is half of its diameter (10 units), so the radius is 10 units.
  - The radius of each smaller circle is half of its diameter (5 units), so the radius is 5 units.
  - The shaded area is the area of the large circle minus the combined areas of the two smaller circles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the circles and their radii.
  - Relate the diameters and radii of the circles.
  - Indicate the shaded region as the difference between the area of the large circle and the areas of the two smaller circles.
