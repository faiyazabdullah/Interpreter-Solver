### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a circle with center \( A \).
  - There are several points on the circumference of the circle: \( R, S, T, U \).
  - Chords \( RS \) and \( TU \) intersect at point \( V \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - Chord \( RS \) is divided into segments \( RV \) and \( VS \). The measurement of \( RV \) is 4 units, and \( VS \) is also 4 units.
  - Chord \( TU \) is divided into segments \( TV \) and \( VU \). The measurement of \( TV \) is 4 units, and the total length of \( TU \) is 8 units. Therefore, \( VU = TU - TV = 8 - 4 = 4 \) units.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings (like right angles, parallel lines, etc.) are visible apart from the chords and their intersection.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The chords \( RS \) and \( TU \) intersect at point \( V \) inside the circle.
  - By the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, the product of the segments of one chord is equal to the product of the segments of the other chord. Mathematically, this means:
    \[
    RV \cdot VS = TV \cdot VU
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( RV = 4 \)
  - \( VS = 4 \)
  - \( TV = 4 \)
  - \( VU = 4 \)

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Using the Intersecting Chords Theorem:
    \[
    RV \cdot VS = TV \cdot VU
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    4 \cdot 4 = 4 \cdot 4
    \]
    This confirms the theorem holds true.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the length of segment \( VU \).
- From the analysis in Step 3, we determined that \( VU = 4 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The key relationships involve the circle, the chords, their segments, and the application of the Intersecting Chords Theorem.
