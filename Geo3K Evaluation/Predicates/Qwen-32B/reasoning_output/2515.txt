REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two triangles are shown: \( \triangle RST \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points labeled: \( R, S, T, A, B, C \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( RS, ST, TR \) form \( \triangle RST \).
  - \( AB, BC, CA \) form \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Segments \( ST \) and \( CA \) are marked as \( 2y - 8 \) and \( y + 13 \), respectively.

- **Angles:**
  - Angles \( \angle RST \) and \( \angle BAC \) are marked as \( (5x + 20)^\circ \) and \( (3x + 40)^\circ \), respectively.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols are present at \( \angle RST \) and \( \angle BAC \), indicating both triangles are right triangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruence:**
  - The problem states \( \triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC \). This implies:
    - Corresponding sides are equal: \( RS = AB \), \( ST = CA \), \( TR = BC \).
    - Corresponding angles are equal: \( \angle RST = \angle BAC \), \( \angle SRT = \angle ABC \), \( \angle STR = \angle BCA \).

- **Right Triangles:**
  - Both \( \triangle RST \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are right triangles, with right angles at \( S \) and \( A \), respectively.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle RST = (5x + 20)^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BAC = (3x + 40)^\circ \).
  - Since the triangles are congruent, \( \angle RST = \angle BAC \).

- **Sides:**
  - \( ST = 2y - 8 \).
  - \( CA = y + 13 \).
  - Since the triangles are congruent, \( ST = CA \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the fact that corresponding angles in congruent triangles are equal: \( \angle RST = \angle BAC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the congruence of the triangles, the equality of corresponding angles, and the equality of corresponding sides.
- The predicates will capture the given measurements and relationships without directly solving for \( x \) or \( y \).
