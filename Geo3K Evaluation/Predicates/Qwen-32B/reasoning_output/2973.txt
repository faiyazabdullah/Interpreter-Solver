REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Shapes and Points:**
  - Two triangles are shown: one labeled \( \triangle ABC \) and the other labeled \( \triangle DEF \).
  - Points \( A, B, C \) form \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( D, E, F \) form \( \triangle DEF \).

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - In \( \triangle ABC \):
    - Side \( BC \) is labeled as 5 units.
    - Side \( AB \) is labeled as \( x \).
  - In \( \triangle DEF \):
    - Side \( EF \) is labeled as 3 units.
    - Side \( DE \) is labeled as \( x - 4 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The angles at \( B \) in \( \triangle ABC \) and at \( D \) in \( \triangle DEF \) are marked as congruent (indicated by the small arcs).
  - Similarly, the angles at \( A \) in \( \triangle ABC \) and at \( E \) in \( \triangle DEF \) are marked as congruent.
  - The angles at \( C \) in \( \triangle ABC \) and at \( F \) in \( \triangle DEF \) are also marked as congruent.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruent Angles:**
  - \( \angle B \cong \angle D \)
  - \( \angle A \cong \angle E \)
  - \( \angle C \cong \angle F \)

- **Similar Triangles:**
  - Since all corresponding angles are congruent (\( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \)), the triangles are similar by the AAA similarity criterion.

- **Proportional Sides:**
  - Corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional. Therefore:
    \[
    \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{AC}{DF}
    \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 5 \)
  - \( EF = 3 \)
  - \( AB = x \)
  - \( DE = x - 4 \)

- **Unknowns:**
  - We need to find \( AB = x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( AB \), denoted as \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the property of similar triangles, specifically the proportionality of corresponding sides:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{DE} = \frac{BC}{EF}
  \]
- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \frac{x}{x - 4} = \frac{5}{3}
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- The predicates will capture the shapes, points, lines, angles, and proportional relationships without solving for \( x \) directly.
