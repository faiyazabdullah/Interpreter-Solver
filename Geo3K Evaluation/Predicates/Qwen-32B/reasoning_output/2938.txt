### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - The figure consists of a series of connected line segments forming an irregular polygon.
  - The polygon appears to have several labeled angles.
  - There are no explicit indications of symmetry, parallelism, or perpendicularity.
  
- **Points and Labels:**
  - Points are labeled as \( L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z \).
  - Some angles are explicitly labeled with their measures: \( 21^\circ, 42^\circ, 29^\circ, 21^\circ, 42^\circ, 29^\circ \).
  - Other angles are expressed in terms of \( x \): \( (x-20)^\circ, (x-10)^\circ, x^\circ, (x+14)^\circ \).

- **Measurements and Annotations:**
  - The angles around the perimeter of the polygon are given in terms of \( x \) and specific degree values.
  - The goal is to find the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is determined by the formula \( (n-2) \times 180^\circ \), where \( n \) is the number of sides.
  - Here, the polygon has 7 sides (heptagon), so the sum of the interior angles is \( (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ \).
  - All given angles contribute to this total sum.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Specific angles: \( 21^\circ, 42^\circ, 29^\circ \).
  - Angles in terms of \( x \): \( (x-20)^\circ, (x-10)^\circ, x^\circ, (x+14)^\circ \).
  
- **Sum of Angles:**
  - The sum of all interior angles in the heptagon must equal \( 900^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Solve for the value of \( x \).
  
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The sum of the interior angles of a heptagon is \( 900^\circ \).
  - Use the given angle expressions to set up an equation.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the polygon and its vertices.
  - Label the angles with their respective measures.
  - Express the sum of the interior angles as a constraint.
  - Ensure all given relationships are represented atomically.
