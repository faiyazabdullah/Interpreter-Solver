REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is inscribed in a circle centered at \(Z\).
  - The circle is denoted as \(\odot Z\).
  - Points \(A, B, C, D\) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Point \(E\) is the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).
  - \(AB \parallel DC\) (indicated by the parallel mark).

- **Angles and Arcs:**
  - \(\angle BZA = 104^\circ\).
  - \(\widehat{CB} = 94^\circ\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Cyclic Quadrilateral Properties:**
  - Since \(ABCD\) is inscribed in \(\odot Z\), opposite angles of the quadrilateral sum to \(180^\circ\).
  - \(\angle BZA\) is a central angle subtended by arc \(\widehat{BA}\).

- **Parallel Lines:**
  - \(AB \parallel DC\) implies that corresponding angles formed by transversals are equal.

- **Circle Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
  - Central angles are twice the measure of the inscribed angles subtending the same arc.

- **Intersection of Diagonals:**
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at \(E\), forming several angles and triangles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(\angle BZA = 104^\circ\): This is a central angle.
  - \(\widehat{CB} = 94^\circ\): This is an arc measure.
  - \(AB \parallel DC\): This indicates parallelism.

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - Since \(\angle BZA\) is a central angle, the arc \(\widehat{BA}\) it subtends has a measure of \(104^\circ\).
  - The arc \(\widehat{CB} = 94^\circ\) is given directly.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \(m\angle ZAC\).
- To find \(m\angle ZAC\), we need to use the properties of the circle, the given angles, and the relationships between the angles formed by the diagonals and the parallel lines.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all given information and relationships in the form of atomic predicates.
- Predicates will cover the cyclic quadrilateral, parallel lines, circle properties, and angle measures.
