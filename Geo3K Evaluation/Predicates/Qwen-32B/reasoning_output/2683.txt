QUESTION: Find P Q.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a quadrilateral \( PQRST \).
  - Key points: \( P, Q, R, S, T \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments: \( PQ, QR, RS, SP, PT, QS \).

- **Measurements:**
  - \( PQ = 6 - x \)
  - \( QR = 3 \)
  - \( RS = 6 + x \)
  - \( SP = 3 + x \)
  - \( PT = 3 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - The triangles formed by the lines \( PQ, QR, RS, SP, PT, QS \) have matching tick marks, indicating equal lengths for certain sides.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Triangles:**
  - Triangles \( PQT \) and \( QRS \) share the side \( QT \).
  - Triangles \( PQT \) and \( QRS \) are likely to be related due to the matching tick marks, suggesting they may be congruent or similar.

- **Congruent or Equal Sides:**
  - The tick marks on \( PQ \) and \( PT \) suggest \( PQ = PT \).
  - Similarly, the tick marks on \( QR \) and \( RS \) suggest \( QR = RS \).

- **Relationships Between Lines:**
  - \( QS \) appears to be a diagonal dividing the quadrilateral into two triangles.
  - The tick marks suggest symmetry or congruence between parts of the quadrilateral.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( PQ = 6 - x \)
  - \( QR = 3 \)
  - \( RS = 6 + x \)
  - \( SP = 3 + x \)
  - \( PT = 3 \)

- **Interpretation:**
  - The lengths \( PQ \) and \( PT \) are equal because they have matching tick marks.
  - Therefore, \( PQ = PT \Rightarrow 6 - x = 3 \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the length of \( PQ \).
- From the measurement analysis, we know \( PQ = 6 - x \).
- Using the equality \( PQ = PT \), we can solve for \( x \) and then find \( PQ \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all visible relationships, including equal lengths, congruent sides, and the given measurements.
- Predicates will capture the geometric shapes, relationships, and constraints without directly solving for the final answer.
