STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2892
================================================================================
QUESTION: in \triangle X Y Z, P is the centroid, K P = 3, and X J = 8. Find Y J.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a triangle \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - There are additional points labeled \( J, L, P, K \).

- **Lines:**
  - Lines connecting the vertices of the triangle (\( XY, YZ, XZ \)).
  - Medians from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side: \( XJ, YL, ZK \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( P \) is marked as the centroid of \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - \( KP = 3 \) is explicitly stated.
  - \( XJ = 8 \) is explicitly stated.

- **Other Observations:**
  - The medians intersect at point \( P \), the centroid.
  - The centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1, where the longer segment is closer to the vertex.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements:**
  - \( P \) is the centroid of \( \triangle XYZ \), so it divides each median in the ratio 2:1.
  - Since \( KP = 3 \), the total length of median \( XK \) is \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) (because \( KP \) is one-third of \( XK \)).
  - The centroid divides the median \( XJ \) in the same 2:1 ratio.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The centroid property ensures that \( XP : PJ = 2 : 1 \).
  - The length of \( XJ = 8 \) implies that \( XP = \frac{2}{3} \times 8 = \frac{16}{3} \) and \( PJ = \frac{1}{3} \times 8 = \frac{8}{3} \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( KP = 3 \).
  - \( XJ = 8 \).

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Since \( P \) is the centroid, \( XP : PJ = 2 : 1 \).
  - Therefore, \( XP = \frac{2}{3} \times 8 = \frac{16}{3} \) and \( PJ = \frac{1}{3} \times 8 = \frac{8}{3} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - Find the length of \( YJ \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1.
  - Since \( XJ = 8 \), we need to determine the relationship between \( YJ \) and the other medians.

- **Information Needed:**
  - The centroid property ensures that the medians are divided in the same 2:1 ratio.
  - Using the centroid's property, we can find \( YJ \) by understanding its relationship with the other medians.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the triangle and its vertices.
  - Indicate that \( P \) is the centroid.
  - Specify the lengths \( KP = 3 \) and \( XJ = 8 \).
  - Use the centroid property to relate the segments.
