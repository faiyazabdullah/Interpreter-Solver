REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is labeled as a rhombus.
  - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are vertices of the rhombus.
  - Point \(E\) is the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - Line segment \(CB\) is marked as 6 units.
  - Angle \(\angle DAB\) is given as 2 radians.
  - Angle \(\angle ADC\) is also mentioned but its measure is not explicitly stated.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) appear to bisect each other at right angles, as is typical for a rhombus.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rhombus Properties**:
  - All sides of a rhombus are equal in length.
  - Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
  - Diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles of the rhombus.

- **Angles**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, \(\angle DAB = \angle CBA\) and \(\angle ADC = \angle BCD\).
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) bisect the angles at their vertices.

- **Diagonals**:
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\) and form four right angles at \(E\).
  - Diagonals bisect each other, so \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(CB = 6\) units.
  - \(\text{Measure of } \angle DAB = 2\) radians.
  - \(\text{Measure of } \angle ADC\) is related to \(\angle DAB\) because they are opposite angles in the rhombus.

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA = 6\) units.
  - The diagonals bisect each other at right angles, so \(\triangle AEB\) and \(\triangle BEC\) are right triangles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle ADB\).
- To find \(\angle ADB\), we need to use the properties of the rhombus and the given angle \(\angle DAB\):
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles at their vertices.
  - Therefore, \(\angle DAB\) is bisected by diagonal \(BD\), so \(\angle DAE = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle DAB = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1\) radian.
  - Since \(\angle ADB\) is part of the right triangle \(\triangle ADE\) formed by the diagonals, we can use trigonometric relationships or angle properties to find \(\angle ADB\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the rhombus properties, the angle measures, and the relationships between the diagonals and sides.
