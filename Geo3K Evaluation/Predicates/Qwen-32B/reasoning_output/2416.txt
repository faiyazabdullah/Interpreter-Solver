REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains several labeled points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \).
- **Lines**: There are multiple lines connecting these points:
  - \( HA \), \( AE \), \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CF \), \( FG \), \( GD \), and \( DB \).
- **Angles**: 
  - At point \( A \), there are two angles labeled: \( 10x^\circ \) and \( (8y + 2)^\circ \).
  - At point \( B \), there is one angle labeled \( (25y - 20)^\circ \).
  - These angles suggest that we are dealing with relationships involving linear pairs or supplementary angles.
- **Special Markings**: There are no special markings like right angles or congruence symbols.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Linear Pair Relationship**: 
  - The angles \( 10x^\circ \) and \( (8y + 2)^\circ \) at point \( A \) appear to form a linear pair because they share a common vertex and lie on a straight line.
  - Similarly, the angles \( (8y + 2)^\circ \) at \( A \) and \( (25y - 20)^\circ \) at \( B \) might be related through some geometric property, such as corresponding angles or alternate interior angles if there are parallel lines.
- **Supplementary Angles**:
  - Since \( 10x^\circ \) and \( (8y + 2)^\circ \) form a linear pair, their sum must be \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( 10x^\circ \): An angle dependent on \( x \).
  - \( (8y + 2)^\circ \): An angle dependent on \( y \).
  - \( (25y - 20)^\circ \): Another angle dependent on \( y \).
- **Relationships**:
  - The angles \( 10x^\circ \) and \( (8y + 2)^\circ \) are supplementary because they form a linear pair.
  - The angle \( (8y + 2)^\circ \) at \( A \) and \( (25y - 20)^\circ \) at \( B \) might be related through some geometric configuration, such as parallel lines or transversals.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \( y \).
- To solve for \( y \), we need to use the relationships between the angles, particularly the fact that the angles forming a linear pair sum to \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and angle measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key relationships are:
  1. The supplementary relationship between \( 10x^\circ \) and \( (8y + 2)^\circ \).
  2. Any additional relationships involving \( (8y + 2)^\circ \) and \( (25y - 20)^\circ \) if they exist.
