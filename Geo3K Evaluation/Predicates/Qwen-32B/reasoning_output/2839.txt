REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present with center \( K \).
  - Three points \( J \), \( K \), and \( L \) are marked on the diagram.
  - \( J \) and \( L \) lie on the circumference of the circle, and \( K \) is the center.
  - A vertical line segment connects \( J \) and \( L \), passing through the center \( K \).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - The line segment \( JK \) is a radius of the circle.
  - The line segment \( KL \) is also a radius of the circle.
  - The line segment \( JL \) is a diameter of the circle.
  - An angle \( \angle JKL \) is marked as \( 180^\circ \), indicating that \( J \) and \( L \) are endpoints of a diameter.

- **Measurements:**
  - The vertical distance from \( J \) to \( L \) is labeled as \( x \) cm, which represents the diameter of the circle.

- **Shaded Region:**
  - The shaded region is a semicircle with diameter \( JL \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( JK \) and \( KL \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( JL \) is the diameter of the circle.
  - Since \( \angle JKL = 180^\circ \), \( J \) and \( L \) lie on opposite ends of the diameter.
  - The shaded region is a semicircle, as it is half of the full circle.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The radius \( r \) of the circle is half of the diameter \( x \): \( r = \frac{x}{2} \).
  - The area of the semicircle is given as \( A = 66 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - The area of the shaded semicircle is \( A = 66 \, \text{cm}^2 \).
  - The diameter of the circle is \( x \) cm.
  - The radius \( r \) is \( \frac{x}{2} \) cm.

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - The area of a semicircle is given by the formula:
    \[
    A = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
    \]
  - Substituting \( r = \frac{x}{2} \):
    \[
    A = \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot \frac{x^2}{4} = \frac{\pi x^2}{8}
    \]
  - Given \( A = 66 \, \text{cm}^2 \), we have:
    \[
    \frac{\pi x^2}{8} = 66
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), the diameter of the circle.
- To find \( x \), we use the relationship between the area of the semicircle and the diameter:
  \[
  \frac{\pi x^2}{8} = 66
  \]
- Solving for \( x \) requires isolating \( x \) in the equation.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using predicates.
- Predicates should capture the circle, its diameter, radius, and the area of the semicircle.
- Ensure all relationships are atomic and do not include the final solution.
