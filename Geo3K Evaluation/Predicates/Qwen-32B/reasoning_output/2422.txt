REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle with center \( O \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The center \( O \) is connected to points \( A \) and \( B \), forming radii \( OA \) and \( OB \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Radii \( OA \) and \( OB \) are drawn from the center \( O \) to points \( A \) and \( B \) respectively.
  - Chord \( AB \) connects points \( A \) and \( B \).

- **Angles:**
  - The central angle \( \angle AOB \) is labeled as \( 80^\circ \).

- **Measurements:**
  - The radius of the circle is given as 14 meters.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - \( O \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( OA \) and \( OB \) are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.
  - \( AB \) is a chord subtended by the central angle \( \angle AOB \).

- **Central Angle:**
  - The central angle \( \angle AOB = 80^\circ \) determines the arc \( \widehat{AB} \).

- **Arc Length:**
  - The arc \( \widehat{AB} \) is part of the circle's circumference.
  - The length of the arc depends on the central angle and the radius.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Radius of the circle: \( r = 14 \) meters.
  - Central angle: \( \theta = 80^\circ \).

- **Relevant Formulas:**
  - The formula for the arc length \( L \) of a circle is:
    \[
    L = r \cdot \theta \quad \text{(where \( \theta \) is in radians)}
    \]
  - Conversion from degrees to radians:
    \[
    \theta_{\text{radians}} = \theta_{\text{degrees}} \cdot \frac{\pi}{180}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of the arc \( \widehat{AB} \).
- To find the arc length, we need:
  1. The radius \( r \) of the circle.
  2. The central angle \( \theta \) in radians.
  3. Use the arc length formula \( L = r \cdot \theta \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Ensure that all visible information is captured, including the circle, its center, radius, points on the circumference, and the central angle.
