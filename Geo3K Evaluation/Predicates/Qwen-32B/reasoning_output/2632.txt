================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, \triangle A B C \sim \triangle D E F. B G is a median of \triangle A B C, and E H is a median of \triangle D E F. Find E H if B C = 30, B G = 15, and E F = 15.

================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Two triangles are shown: \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \).
  - \( \triangle ABC \) has vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  - \( \triangle DEF \) has vertices \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \).
  - \( BG \) is a median of \( \triangle ABC \), connecting vertex \( B \) to the midpoint \( G \) of side \( AC \).
  - \( EH \) is a median of \( \triangle DEF \), connecting vertex \( E \) to the midpoint \( H \) of side \( DF \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) form \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Lines \( DE \), \( EF \), and \( FD \) form \( \triangle DEF \).
  - Line \( BG \) connects \( B \) to \( G \).
  - Line \( EH \) connects \( E \) to \( H \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( BC = 30 \).
  - \( BG = 15 \).
  - \( EF = 15 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - No specific markings indicate right angles, congruence, or parallelism.
  - The problem states \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \), indicating similarity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similar Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \) implies corresponding sides are proportional, and corresponding angles are equal.
  - Since \( BG \) is a median of \( \triangle ABC \) and \( EH \) is a median of \( \triangle DEF \), the medians are also proportional due to similarity.

- **Medians**:
  - \( BG \) is a median of \( \triangle ABC \), connecting \( B \) to the midpoint \( G \) of \( AC \).
  - \( EH \) is a median of \( \triangle DEF \), connecting \( E \) to the midpoint \( H \) of \( DF \).

- **Proportional Relationships**:
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF \), the ratio of corresponding sides is constant. This ratio applies to the medians as well.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( BC = 30 \): Length of side \( BC \) in \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( BG = 15 \): Length of median \( BG \) in \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( EF = 15 \): Length of side \( EF \) in \( \triangle DEF \).

- **Implications**:
  - The ratio of the sides of \( \triangle ABC \) to \( \triangle DEF \) is \( \frac{BC}{EF} = \frac{30}{15} = 2 \).
  - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the medians \( BG \) and \( EH \) will also be 2.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks to find the length of \( EH \), the median of \( \triangle DEF \).
- Using the similarity of triangles, the ratio of the medians \( BG \) and \( EH \) is the same as the ratio of the corresponding sides \( BC \) and \( EF \).
- Given \( BG = 15 \) and the similarity ratio \( 2 \), we can find \( EH \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, their similarity, the medians, and the proportional relationships.
- Ensure all given measurements and geometric relationships are captured.
