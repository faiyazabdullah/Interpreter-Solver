REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A, B, C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - Additional points \( R, M, S, T \) are marked within or on the edges of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Line segments \( AM, BM, CM \) intersect at point \( M \), suggesting \( M \) could be a centroid or some other significant point.
  - Line segments \( AR, AS, AT \) are drawn from \( A \) to points \( R, S, T \).
  
- **Measurements:**
  - \( MC = 7 \).
  - \( RM = 4 \).
  - \( AT = 16 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Parallel lines are indicated by pink double arrows, suggesting certain segments are parallel.
    - \( AR \parallel BT \parallel CS \).
  - These parallel lines imply specific proportional relationships due to similar triangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines:**
  - Since \( AR \parallel BT \parallel CS \), triangles formed by these lines will be similar by AA similarity (Angle-Angle similarity).
  
- **Proportional Relationships:**
  - The parallel lines create smaller triangles that are similar to \( \triangle ABC \). This implies proportional segment lengths.
  
- **Point \( M \):**
  - Point \( M \) appears to be a key intersection point, possibly the centroid or another significant center of the triangle, but this needs further clarification based on the context.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( MC = 7 \): The length of segment \( MC \).
  - \( RM = 4 \): The length of segment \( RM \).
  - \( AT = 16 \): The length of segment \( AT \).

- **Inferred Relationships:**
  - Since \( AR \parallel BT \parallel CS \), the segments divided by these parallels will have proportional lengths. For example, if \( M \) divides \( AR \) and \( BT \) in a specific ratio, the same ratio will apply to other segments.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Find the length \( MB \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The parallel lines and the proportional relationships they create are crucial.
  - The given lengths \( MC = 7 \), \( RM = 4 \), and \( AT = 16 \) will help establish the proportionality constants.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and its components.
  - Capture the parallel relationships.
  - Include the given measurements.
  - Ensure all visible constraints and relationships are represented.
