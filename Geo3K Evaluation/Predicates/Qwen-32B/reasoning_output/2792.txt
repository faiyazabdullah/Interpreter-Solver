================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Triangles: ΔABE, ΔACF, ΔADG.
  - Lines: BE, EF, FC, CD, DA, AG.
  - Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
  
- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - ∠E = 63°.
  - ∠D = 7.
  - ∠A = 136°.
  - ∠BFE = 69°.
  - ∠DFC = 47°.
  - Line segments labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Angles are labeled with specific measures.
  - No explicit markings for parallelism, perpendicularity, or congruence.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Triangles:**
  - ΔABE, ΔACF, ΔADG share point A.
  - ΔBEF and ΔCDF are formed by intersecting lines.
  
- **Angles:**
  - ∠E, ∠D, and ∠A are exterior angles of triangles.
  - ∠BFE and ∠DFC are interior angles at point F.
  - The relationship between angles at point F is crucial since they form a linear pair with other angles.

- **Lines:**
  - BE, EF, FC, CD, DA, AG are collinear or intersecting segments.
  - Point F is the intersection of lines BE and CD.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values:**
  - ∠E = 63°: An exterior angle of ΔABE.
  - ∠D = 7: Likely a label for a side, not an angle.
  - ∠A = 136°: An exterior angle of ΔADG.
  - ∠BFE = 69°: An interior angle at point F.
  - ∠DFC = 47°: Another interior angle at point F.

- **Key Observations:**
  - The sum of angles around point F must equal 360°.
  - Angles ∠BFE and ∠DFC are part of the same linear pair with other angles at F.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **Goal:** Find the measure of ∠3 if m∠4 = m∠5.
- **Relevant Information:**
  - ∠3 is part of ΔACF.
  - ∠4 and ∠5 are angles related to the configuration around point F.
  - The condition m∠4 = m∠5 introduces a symmetry or congruence constraint.
  
- **Plan:**
  - Use the given angle measures (∠BFE = 69°, ∠DFC = 47°) to determine other angles at point F.
  - Use the condition m∠4 = m∠5 to deduce additional relationships.
  - Apply angle sum properties in triangles and at a point to find ∠3.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- Represent all visible geometric relationships, including angles, lines, and the equality condition.
- Ensure that the predicates capture the key constraints without directly solving for ∠3.
