REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains a triangle \( \triangle DGF \).
  - Points labeled: \( D \), \( G \), and \( F \).
  - Additional point \( G \) appears to be part of a right angle.

- **Lines:**
  - \( DG \) is a line segment with length 15.
  - \( GF \) is a line segment with length 19.
  - \( DF \) is a line segment labeled \( x \).

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle DGF \) is marked as \( 125^\circ \).
  - There is a right angle at point \( G \), indicated by a small square.

- **Measurements:**
  - \( DG = 15 \)
  - \( GF = 19 \)
  - \( DF = x \) (to be found).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle DGF \) is a triangle with one known angle (\( \angle DGF = 125^\circ \)).
  - \( \angle DGF \) is an obtuse angle.
  - The presence of a right angle at \( G \) suggests a perpendicular relationship between two sides meeting at \( G \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( DG = 15 \): One side of the triangle.
  - \( GF = 19 \): Another side of the triangle.
  - \( DF = x \): The hypotenuse or the side opposite the obtuse angle, which needs to be calculated.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is being asked?**
  - The problem asks for the length of \( DF \), denoted as \( x \).
  - To find \( x \), we need to use the Law of Cosines since we have two sides and the included obtuse angle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Geometric Relationships:**
  - Define the triangle and its sides.
  - Specify the lengths of the sides.
  - Indicate the angle between the sides.
  - Use the Law of Cosines to relate the sides and the angle.
