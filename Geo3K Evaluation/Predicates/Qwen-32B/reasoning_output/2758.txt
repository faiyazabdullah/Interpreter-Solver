================================================================================
QUESTION: Trapezoid G H J K has an area of 75 square meters. Find the height.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:  
  The image shows a quadrilateral labeled \( \text{G H J K} \). It is identified as a trapezoid because it has one pair of parallel sides (\( \text{GH} \) and \( \text{KJ} \)).
  
- **Lines and Measurements**:  
  - The top base \( \text{GH} \) is labeled as \( 17 \) meters.  
  - The bottom base \( \text{KJ} \) is labeled as \( 13 \) meters.  
  - The height of the trapezoid is not explicitly shown but needs to be determined.  

- **Special Markings**:  
  The trapezoid is shaded, indicating it is the primary region of interest. There are no right-angle symbols or additional markings indicating specific angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Sides**:  
  The bases \( \text{GH} \) and \( \text{KJ} \) are parallel, as indicated by the definition of a trapezoid.  
  - Parallel(\( \text{Line(G,H)}, \text{Line(K,J)} \))

- **Quadrilateral Properties**:  
  The figure is a trapezoid, so it has four sides with one pair of parallel sides.  
  - Trapezoid(\( \text{G, H, J, K} \))

- **Height**:  
  The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel bases \( \text{GH} \) and \( \text{KJ} \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:  
  - Top base \( \text{GH} = 17 \) meters.  
  - Bottom base \( \text{KJ} = 13 \) meters.  
  - Area of the trapezoid is given as \( 75 \) square meters.  

- **Relationships**:  
  The area formula for a trapezoid is:  
  \[
  \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Top Base} + \text{Bottom Base}) \times \text{Height}
  \]  
  Substituting the known values:  
  \[
  75 = \frac{1}{2} \times (17 + 13) \times \text{Height}
  \]  
  Simplifying:  
  \[
  75 = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 \times \text{Height} \implies 75 = 15 \times \text{Height} \implies \text{Height} = 5 \text{ meters}
  \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the height of the trapezoid.  
- The relevant geometric property is the area formula for a trapezoid.  
- We need to use the given area and the lengths of the bases to solve for the height.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the trapezoid and its properties.  
- Include the measurements of the bases and the area.  
- Ensure all visible relationships are captured without directly stating the solution.
