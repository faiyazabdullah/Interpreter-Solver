REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes Identified:**
  - A quadrilateral (rectangle) with vertices \( A, B, C, D \).
  - A triangle \( \triangle ABE \) inside the rectangle.
  - The quadrilateral is divided into two regions: the triangle \( \triangle ABE \) and the remaining shaded region.

- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points: \( A, B, C, D, E \).
  - Lines: 
    - \( AB \), \( BE \), \( AE \) form \( \triangle ABE \).
    - \( AD \), \( DC \), \( CB \), \( BA \) form the rectangle.
    - \( DE \) is a vertical segment within the rectangle.

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( AB = 5 \) meters.
  - \( BE = 6 \) meters.
  - The hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABE \) is \( AE = 4 \) meters.
  - The segment \( DE \) is marked as vertical, indicating it is perpendicular to the base \( AD \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols at \( \angle ABE \) and \( \angle BAE \), indicating \( \triangle ABE \) is a right triangle.
  - Parallel lines indicated by the dashed lines, suggesting \( AB \parallel DE \) and \( AD \parallel BE \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABE \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ABE = 90^\circ \).
  - The quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is a rectangle, as indicated by the right angles at each vertex.
  - \( AB \parallel DE \) and \( AD \parallel BE \), confirming the rectangle's properties.
  - The hypotenuse \( AE \) of \( \triangle ABE \) is given as 4 meters, and the legs are 5 meters and 6 meters.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( AB = 5 \) meters.
  - \( BE = 6 \) meters.
  - \( AE = 4 \) meters (hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABE \)).
  - The dimensions of the rectangle are \( AB = 5 \) meters and \( BE = 6 \) meters.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the area of the entire figure, which includes the rectangle minus the area of \( \triangle ABE \).

- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The area of the rectangle is \( AB \times BE \).
  - The area of \( \triangle ABE \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BE \).
  - The total area is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the shapes and their properties.
  - Specify the measurements and relationships.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are represented.
