QUESTION: Find X Z.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle XYZ \).
  - Points \( X \), \( Y \), \( Z \), and \( W \) are labeled.
  - Line segments \( XY \), \( YZ \), and \( ZX \) form the sides of the triangle.

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - \( XY \) is the base of the triangle.
  - \( YZ \) is one leg of the triangle.
  - \( ZX \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - There is a right angle at point \( W \) (indicated by the red square).

- **Measurements:**
  - The length of \( XY \) is given as \( 18 + 2y \).
  - The length of \( YZ \) is given as \( 5y - 6 \).
  - The hypotenuse \( ZX \) is labeled but its length is not directly given.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle at \( W \) indicates that \( \triangle XYZ \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( Y \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle XYZ \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( Y \).
  - \( XY \) and \( YZ \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( ZX \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The Pythagorean theorem will apply: \( XY^2 + YZ^2 = ZX^2 \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The lengths of \( XY \) and \( YZ \) are expressed in terms of \( y \).
  - The hypotenuse \( ZX \) is what we need to find in terms of \( y \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( XY = 18 + 2y \)
  - \( YZ = 5y - 6 \)
  - \( ZX \) is the hypotenuse, and its length needs to be determined.

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem: \( (XY)^2 + (YZ)^2 = (ZX)^2 \).
  - Substituting the given expressions:
    \[
    (18 + 2y)^2 + (5y - 6)^2 = ZX^2
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks for the length of \( ZX \), the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle XYZ \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem is the key property to use here.
  - The lengths of the legs \( XY \) and \( YZ \) are given in terms of \( y \), so we need to express \( ZX \) in terms of \( y \) as well.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle and its components.
  - Capture the right angle at \( Y \).
  - Express the lengths of the sides in terms of \( y \).
  - Use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides.

- **Completeness Check:**
  - All visible geometric relationships and measurements are included.
  - The predicates will allow another system to derive the length of \( ZX \) using the Pythagorean theorem.
