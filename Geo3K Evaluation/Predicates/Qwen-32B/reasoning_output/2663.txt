REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure is a trapezoid labeled \( G H J K \).
- **Points**: 
  - The vertices of the trapezoid are labeled \( G, H, J, K \).
- **Lines**: 
  - The sides of the trapezoid are \( G H, H J, J K, \) and \( G K \).
- **Measurements**:
  - \( H J = 16.5 \) ft (top base).
  - The height of the trapezoid (perpendicular distance between the bases) is \( 8.7 \) ft.
  - The area of the trapezoid is \( 188.35 \) square feet.
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols indicate that the height is perpendicular to both bases.
  - The bases \( H J \) and \( G K \) are parallel.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( H J \parallel G K \) (bases of the trapezoid are parallel).
  - The height is perpendicular to both bases.
  - The trapezoid's area is given, and it relates to the lengths of the bases and the height.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - Top base \( H J = 16.5 \) ft.
  - Height \( h = 8.7 \) ft.
  - Area of trapezoid \( A = 188.35 \) square feet.
- **Relationships**:
  - The area formula for a trapezoid is \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h \), where \( b_1 \) and \( b_2 \) are the lengths of the two bases, and \( h \) is the height.
  - Here, \( b_1 = H J = 16.5 \) ft, \( b_2 = G K \), and \( h = 8.7 \) ft.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - Find the length of the bottom base \( G K \).
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - Use the area formula of the trapezoid to relate the given area, height, and top base to the bottom base.
- **Information Needed**:
  - The formula for the area of a trapezoid: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent**:
  - The trapezoid and its vertices.
  - The parallel relationship between the bases.
  - The perpendicular relationship between the height and the bases.
  - The measurements of the top base, height, and area.
  - The relationship expressed by the area formula.
