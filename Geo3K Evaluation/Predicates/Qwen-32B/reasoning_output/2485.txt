REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is marked as a rhombus.
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).
  
- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), \(E\).
  - Lines: \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DA\), \(AC\), \(BD\).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at \(E\) and form right angles (\(\perp\) symbol at \(E\)).
  - All sides of the rhombus (\(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DA\)) are equal in length.

- **Measurements:**
  - \(AB = 2x + 3\).
  - \(BC = 5x\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Rhombus:**
  - All sides are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
  - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
  - Diagonals act as perpendicular bisectors of each other.

- **Key Relationships:**
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at \(E\) such that \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).
  - The diagonals are perpendicular: \(\perpendicular(Line(AC), Line(BD))\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(AB = 2x + 3\).
  - \(BC = 5x\).
  - Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, we have:
    \[
    AB = BC \implies 2x + 3 = 5x.
    \]
  - Solving for \(x\):
    \[
    2x + 3 = 5x \implies 3x = 3 \implies x = 1.
    \]
  - Therefore, the side length of the rhombus is:
    \[
    AB = BC = CD = DA = 2(1) + 3 = 5.
    \]

- **Angles:**
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Thus, \(\angle AEB = 90^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle AEB\).
- From the properties of a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, so \(\angle AEB = 90^\circ\).
- No further calculations are needed since the property directly gives the answer.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and properties visible in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the fact that \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the intersection point \(E\) is the midpoint of both diagonals.
