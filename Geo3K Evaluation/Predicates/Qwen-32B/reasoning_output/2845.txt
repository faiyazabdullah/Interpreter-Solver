REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points \( A, B, C, D, E \).
- **Lines**: 
  - \( AB \)
  - \( BC \)
  - \( CD \)
  - \( DA \)
  - \( BE \)
  - \( CE \)
- **Angles**: 
  - \( \angle 1 \) at point \( A \)
  - \( \angle 2 \) at point \( B \)
  - \( \angle 3 \) at point \( B \)
  - \( \angle 4 \) at point \( C \)
  - \( \angle 5 \) at point \( E \)
  - \( \angle 6 \) at point \( E \)
  - \( \angle 7 \) at point \( E \)
  - \( \angle 8 \) at point \( C \)
  - \( \angle 9 \) at point \( D \)
- **Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle 1 = 58^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 2 = 47^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \)
- **Special Markings**:
  - No explicit markings for parallel lines, perpendicular lines, or right angles are visible.
  - Angles are labeled with numbers for reference.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Shapes**:
  - Quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is formed by points \( A, B, C, D \).
  - Triangle \( BCE \) is formed by points \( B, C, E \).
  - Triangle \( CED \) is formed by points \( C, E, D \).
- **Angle Relationships**:
  - \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3 \) are exterior angles at points \( A, B, B \) respectively.
  - \( \angle 4, \angle 5, \angle 6, \angle 7, \angle 8, \angle 9 \) are interior angles within triangles and quadrilateral.
  - The sum of angles around point \( E \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The sum of angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given:
  - \( m\angle 1 = 58^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 2 = 47^\circ \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 26^\circ \)
- These measurements will be used to determine other angles using angle relationships such as:
  - Exterior angle theorem: An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
  - Angle sum property of triangles and quadrilaterals.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 9 \).
- To find \( \angle 9 \), we need to use the relationships between the angles in the quadrilateral \( ABCD \) and the triangles \( BCE \) and \( CED \).
- Key relationships:
  1. The sum of angles in triangle \( BCE \) is \( 180^\circ \).
  2. The sum of angles in triangle \( CED \) is \( 180^\circ \).
  3. The sum of angles around point \( E \) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using predicates.
- Predicates will capture:
  - The shapes (quadrilateral, triangles).
  - The points, lines, and angles.
  - The given angle measures.
  - The relationships between angles (e.g., exterior angle theorem, angle sum property).
