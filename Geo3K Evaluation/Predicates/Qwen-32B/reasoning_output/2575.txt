REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a circle with center \( C \).
  - There are four points on the circumference: \( R, S, Q, T \).
  - Chords \( RS \) and \( QT \) intersect at point \( A \) inside the circle.

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Lines \( RS \) and \( QT \) are chords of the circle.
  - Angles are marked at the intersections and along the arcs:
    - The arc \( RS \) is labeled \( (5x + 4)^\circ \).
    - The arc \( QT \) is labeled \( (6x - 2)^\circ \).
    - The angle \( \angle QAR \) is marked as \( 32^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings indicating perpendicularity, parallelism, or congruence are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The circle is the primary shape, and all points \( R, S, Q, T \) lie on its circumference.
  - Chords \( RS \) and \( QT \) intersect at point \( A \), forming inscribed angles.
  - The arcs \( RS \) and \( QT \) are subtended by the respective chords.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
  - The sum of the measures of the arcs in a circle is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Measurements:**
  - Arc \( RS \): \( (5x + 4)^\circ \)
  - Arc \( QT \): \( (6x - 2)^\circ \)
  - Angle \( \angle QAR \): \( 32^\circ \)

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The inscribed angle \( \angle QAR \) intercepts arc \( RS \). Therefore, \( \angle QAR = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{arc } RS \).
  - Similarly, other inscribed angles can be related to their intercepted arcs.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Find the measure of \( \angle S \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
  - The total measure of the arcs in a circle is \( 360^\circ \).

- **Information Needed:**
  - Solve for \( x \) using the given arc measures and the inscribed angle \( \angle QAR \).
  - Use the value of \( x \) to determine the measure of arc \( RS \).
  - Relate the measure of arc \( RS \) to the inscribed angle \( \angle S \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the circle and its points.
  - Specify the arcs and their measures.
  - Relate the inscribed angles to their intercepted arcs.
  - Use the given angle \( \angle QAR \) to establish a relationship with arc \( RS \).
