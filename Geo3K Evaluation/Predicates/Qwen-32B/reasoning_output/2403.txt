STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2403
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains a triangle \( \triangle BDC \).
  - There is a right triangle \( \triangle BAD \) formed by extending a perpendicular from \( B \) to \( DC \).
  - Points labeled: \( B, D, A, C \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( BD = 32 \) (length of one leg of the larger triangle).
  - \( BA \) is the perpendicular segment from \( B \) to \( DC \).
  - \( AC = 54^\circ \) indicates the measure of angle \( \angle BAC \).
  - \( DC \) is the base of the larger triangle, with \( DA \) and \( AC \) as its segments.

- **Angles:**
  - \( \angle BAD \) is a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
  - \( \angle BAC = 54^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol at \( \angle BAD \) confirms it is a right angle.
  - Congruent marks indicate that \( \triangle BAD \) and \( \triangle BAC \) share certain properties due to symmetry or similarity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle BAD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BAD = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle BAC \) shares the same height \( BA \) as \( \triangle BAD \).
  - Since \( \triangle BAD \) and \( \triangle BAC \) share the same height and are part of the larger triangle \( \triangle BDC \), they are similar by AA similarity (both have \( \angle B \) and \( \angle BAD = 90^\circ \)).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The height \( BA \) is common to both smaller triangles.
  - The base \( DC \) is divided into two segments: \( DA \) and \( AC \).
  - The angle \( \angle BAC = 54^\circ \) helps in determining the trigonometric relationships within the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( BD = 32 \) (hypotenuse of \( \triangle BAD \)).
  - \( \angle BAC = 54^\circ \).
  - \( DC = x \) (the total base of the larger triangle, which we need to find).

- **Trigonometric Implications:**
  - In \( \triangle BAD \), \( \sin(54^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BA}{BD} \).
  - Using this, we can find \( BA \) (height) and then use it to find \( x \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the length of the base \( DC \).
- To find \( x \), we need to use the relationships between the sides and angles of the triangles, particularly the properties of right triangles and trigonometric functions.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements accurately.
- Predicates should capture the right angles, triangle properties, and trigonometric relationships without directly solving for \( x \).
