REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure contains a quadrilateral \(RSTV\) and two smaller triangles formed by the segments \(RX\), \(XY\), and \(YT\).
  - Key points are labeled as \(R\), \(S\), \(T\), \(V\), \(X\), \(Y\).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Segments \(RS\), \(VT\), \(RX\), \(XY\), and \(YT\) are explicitly shown.
  - \(RS = 6\) and \(VT = 3\) are given.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Parallel marks indicate that \(RS \parallel VT\).
  - Right angle symbols indicate that \(\angle RXV\), \(\angle SYT\), and \(\angle RXT\) are right angles.
  - Congruence marks indicate that certain segments are equal in length.

- **Measurements**:
  - \(RS = 6\)
  - \(VT = 3\)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Relationships**:
  - \(RS \parallel VT\) (indicated by parallel marks).

- **Perpendicular Relationships**:
  - \(\angle RXV = 90^\circ\)
  - \(\angle SYT = 90^\circ\)
  - \(\angle RXT = 90^\circ\)

- **Congruence and Proportional Relationships**:
  - The problem states that \(RX\) is twice the length of \(XV\). Thus, \(RX = 2 \cdot XV\).

- **Triangle Relationships**:
  - Triangles \(RXV\) and \(SYT\) are right triangles.
  - Triangles \(RXV\) and \(SYT\) share proportional relationships due to the parallel lines and right angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(RS = 6\)
  - \(VT = 3\)

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \(RS \parallel VT\) and the figure suggests similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides in triangles \(RXV\) and \(SYT\) is consistent with the ratio of \(RS\) to \(VT\), which is \(2:1\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**: Find the length of \(XY\).
- **Relevant Properties**:
  - The problem states \(RX = 2 \cdot XV\), which implies a proportional relationship within the quadrilateral.
  - The parallel lines and right angles suggest that triangles \(RXV\) and \(SYT\) are similar, with a scale factor of 2.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Define the quadrilateral and triangles.
  - Specify the points and lines involved.

- **Predicates for Measurements**:
  - Include the given lengths \(RS = 6\) and \(VT = 3\).

- **Predicates for Relationships**:
  - Capture the parallel and perpendicular relationships.
  - Include the proportional relationship \(RX = 2 \cdot XV\).

- **Predicates for Similarity**:
  - Indicate the similarity between triangles \(RXV\) and \(SYT\).
