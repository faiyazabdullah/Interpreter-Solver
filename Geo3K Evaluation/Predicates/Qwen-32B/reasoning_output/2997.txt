### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a circle with center \( H \).
  - There are four points on the circumference of the circle: \( F \), \( G \), \( J \), and \( H \) (the center).
  - A triangle \( \triangle FHJ \) is inscribed within the circle.
  
- **Lines and Chords**:
  - \( FG \) is a chord of the circle.
  - \( FJ \) and \( HJ \) are line segments forming part of the triangle \( \triangle FHJ \).
  - \( FH \) is a radius of the circle.

- **Angles**:
  - An angle \( \angle FGH \) is subtended by the chord \( FG \) at the circumference.
  - The measure of \( \angle FGH \) is given as \( 70^\circ \).
  - Another angle \( \angle FHJ \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - There are no additional markings indicating right angles, parallel lines, or congruence.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Cyclic Properties**:
  - Since \( \triangle FHJ \) is inscribed in the circle, the angle subtended by a chord at the center (\( \angle FHJ \)) is twice the angle subtended by the same chord at the circumference (\( \angle FGH \)).
  - This follows from the **Central Angle Theorem**: \( \text{Measure of central angle} = 2 \times \text{Measure of inscribed angle} \).

- **Inscribed Angles**:
  - The angle \( \angle FGH \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the chord \( FG \).
  - The angle \( \angle FHJ \) is a central angle subtended by the same chord \( FG \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle FGH = 70^\circ \).

- **Unknown Measurement**:
  - \( \angle FHJ = x^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \).
- To find \( x \), we use the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle subtended by the same chord.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the cyclic properties, the central angle theorem, and the given angle measurements.
- The predicates will capture the relationships between the angles and the circle.
