REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes:**
  - The figure appears to be a trapezoid \(ABCD\).
  - There is a rectangle within the trapezoid, with vertices \(B\), \(D\), \(H\), and \(C\).
  
- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\), and \(H\).
  - Lines: 
    - \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel (bases of the trapezoid).
    - \(BC\) and \(AD\) are the non-parallel sides (legs of the trapezoid).
    - \(BH\) is a vertical segment (altitude of the trapezoid).
    - \(CH\) is a horizontal segment, forming part of the rectangle \(BCDH\).

- **Measurements:**
  - \(AB = 11 \, \text{km}\) (length of the bottom base).
  - \(CD = 8 \, \text{km}\) (length of the top base).
  - \(BH = 10 \, \text{km}\) (height of the trapezoid).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \(BH\) is marked as vertical, indicating it is perpendicular to both \(AB\) and \(CD\).
  - \(BCDH\) forms a rectangle, indicating that \(BH\) and \(CH\) are perpendicular.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Relationships:**
  - \(AB \parallel CD\) (top and bottom bases of the trapezoid).
  
- **Perpendicular Relationships:**
  - \(BH \perp AB\) and \(BH \perp CD\) (altitude of the trapezoid).
  - \(BC \perp BH\) and \(DH \perp BH\) (indicating \(BCDH\) is a rectangle).

- **Rectangle Identification:**
  - \(BCDH\) is a rectangle because opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles.

- **Trapezoid Identification:**
  - \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid because it has one pair of parallel sides (\(AB\) and \(CD\)).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \(AB = 11 \, \text{km}\): Length of the longer base.
  - \(CD = 8 \, \text{km}\): Length of the shorter base.
  - \(BH = 10 \, \text{km}\): Height of the trapezoid (and also the height of the rectangle \(BCDH\)).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The height \(BH\) is common to both the trapezoid and the rectangle.
  - The length of \(CH\) can be calculated as the difference between the lengths of the bases:
    \[
    CH = AB - CD = 11 - 8 = 3 \, \text{km}.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks for the area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula:
    \[
    \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}.
    \]
  - Here, \(\text{Base}_1 = AB = 11 \, \text{km}\), \(\text{Base}_2 = CD = 8 \, \text{km}\), and \(\text{Height} = BH = 10 \, \text{km}\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the trapezoid and its components.
  - Specify the measurements of the bases and height.
  - Indicate parallel and perpendicular relationships.
  - Represent the rectangle within the trapezoid.
