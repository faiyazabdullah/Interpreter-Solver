### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains several labeled points: \( H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z \). Specifically, we focus on points \( H, F, G, C, B, D, E, I \).
- **Lines**: Lines are drawn connecting these points, forming multiple angles and shapes.
- **Angles**: 
  - \( \angle 1 \) is formed by lines \( HC \) and \( FC \).
  - \( \angle HCG \) is marked as a right angle (90°).
  - \( \angle DCE \) is marked as 157°.
  - \( \angle FCB \) is marked as 90°.
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols are present at \( \angle HCG \) and \( \angle FCB \).
  - These indicate that \( \angle HCG \) and \( \angle FCB \) are both 90°.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Right Angles**: 
  - \( \angle HCG \) and \( \angle FCB \) are both right angles, meaning they measure 90°.
  - This implies that lines \( HG \) and \( CF \) are perpendicular to lines \( CG \) and \( CB \), respectively.
- **Adjacent Angles**: 
  - \( \angle 1 \) is adjacent to \( \angle HCG \), and \( \angle HCG \) is a right angle.
  - \( \angle FCB \) is adjacent to \( \angle 1 \), and \( \angle FCB \) is also a right angle.
- **Exterior Angle**: 
  - \( \angle DCE \) is given as 157°, which is an exterior angle relative to the internal angles formed by lines \( DC \) and \( CE \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle HCG = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle FCB = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle DCE = 157^\circ \)
- **Implications**:
  - Since \( \angle HCG \) and \( \angle FCB \) are right angles, they each measure 90°.
  - The sum of angles around point \( C \) must equal 360°.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 1 \).
- To find \( \angle 1 \), we need to use the fact that the sum of angles around point \( C \) is 360° and account for the given right angles and the exterior angle \( \angle DCE \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships, including the right angles, the measure of \( \angle DCE \), and the fact that the sum of angles around point \( C \) is 360°.
- Predicates will capture the relationships between lines, angles, and the specific measurements provided.
