REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a circle with center \( L \).
  - Points \( G, H, J, K \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( GH \) and \( JK \) are chords of the circle.
  
- **Lines and Chords:**
  - \( GH \) is a chord connecting points \( G \) and \( H \).
  - \( JK \) is a chord connecting points \( J \) and \( K \).

- **Angles:**
  - An angle \( \angle GHJ \) is marked as \( 83^\circ \).
  - Another angle \( \angle GKJ \) is marked as \( (2x - 27)^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The problem states \( GH \cong KJ \), indicating that the chords \( GH \) and \( JK \) are congruent.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Congruent Chords:**
  - Since \( GH \cong KJ \), the corresponding arcs subtended by these chords are also congruent.
  - In a circle, congruent chords subtend equal central angles and equal inscribed angles.

- **Inscribed Angles:**
  - \( \angle GHJ \) and \( \angle GKJ \) are inscribed angles subtending the respective arcs.
  - By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it subtends.

- **Relationship Between Angles:**
  - Since \( GH \cong KJ \), the arcs \( \overset{\frown}{GH} \) and \( \overset{\frown}{JK} \) are congruent.
  - Therefore, the inscribed angles \( \angle GHJ \) and \( \angle GKJ \) are equal.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( \angle GHJ = 83^\circ \).
  - \( \angle GKJ = (2x - 27)^\circ \).

- **Relevant Properties:**
  - Since \( GH \cong KJ \), the inscribed angles \( \angle GHJ \) and \( \angle GKJ \) must be equal.
  - This implies \( \angle GHJ = \angle GKJ \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \) given that \( GH \cong KJ \).
- From the analysis, we know that \( \angle GHJ = \angle GKJ \).
- Therefore, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  83 = 2x - 27
  \]
- Solving for \( x \) will give us the required value.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The predicates should capture the congruence of chords, the equality of inscribed angles, and the given angle measures.
