REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle with center \( R \).
  - A regular polygon is inscribed in the circle. The vertices of the polygon are labeled as \( J, K, L, M, N, P \).
  - The circle is centered at point \( R \), and the polygon has six vertices, indicating it is a regular hexagon.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Lines connecting the center \( R \) to the vertices \( J, K, L, M, N, P \) are radii of the circle.
  - These radii divide the circle into equal central angles.
  - There is a right-angle symbol at \( \angle KSL \), indicating \( \angle KSL = 90^\circ \).

- **Measurements and Labels:**
  - No specific numerical measurements are provided for lengths or angles.
  - The regularity of the polygon implies symmetry and equal side lengths.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The polygon is regular, meaning all its sides and angles are equal.
  - The circle is circumscribed around the polygon, and the polygon is inscribed in the circle.
  - The center \( R \) of the circle is also the center of the regular hexagon.
  - Each side of the hexagon is a chord of the circle.
  - Radii \( RJ, RK, RL, RM, RN, RP \) are equal in length, as they are radii of the same circle.
  - The central angles formed by consecutive radii are equal.

- **Implied Properties:**
  - Since the polygon is a regular hexagon, it has 6 equal sides and 6 equal interior angles.
  - The circle is divided into 6 equal central angles because the hexagon is regular.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values:**
  - No explicit numerical values are given for lengths or angles.
  - However, the regularity of the hexagon and the circle implies specific geometric properties:
    - The sum of the central angles around the center \( R \) is \( 360^\circ \).
    - Since there are 6 equal central angles, each central angle measures \( \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **Question Objective:**
  - The problem asks for the measure of a central angle of the regular hexagon inscribed in the circle.
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The central angles are formed by consecutive radii of the circle.
  - In a regular hexagon, all central angles are equal.
  - The total sum of the central angles around the center is \( 360^\circ \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Define the regular hexagon and its vertices.
  - Indicate that the hexagon is inscribed in the circle.
  - Specify that the radii are equal.
  - State that the central angles are equal and calculate their measure based on the total \( 360^\circ \).
