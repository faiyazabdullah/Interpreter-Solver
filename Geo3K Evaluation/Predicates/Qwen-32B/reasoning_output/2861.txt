STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2861
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, line l is parallel to line m. Line n intersects both l and m. Which of the following lists includes all of the angles that are supplementary to \angle 1?

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( A, B, C, E, F, G, N \).
- **Lines**: 
  - Line \( l \) passes through points \( E \) and \( B \).
  - Line \( m \) passes through points \( A \) and \( F \).
  - Line \( n \) passes through points \( N \) and \( G \), intersecting both \( l \) and \( m \) at points \( B \) and \( C \), respectively.
- **Angles**: 
  - Angles are labeled numerically from 1 to 8.
  - \(\angle 1\) is formed by lines \( l \) and \( n \) at point \( B \).
  - \(\angle 2\) is adjacent to \(\angle 1\) and forms a linear pair.
  - \(\angle 3\) and \(\angle 4\) are vertical angles formed by the intersection of \( l \) and \( n \).
  - \(\angle 5\) and \(\angle 6\) are vertical angles formed by the intersection of \( m \) and \( n \).
  - \(\angle 7\) and \(\angle 8\) are adjacent angles formed by lines \( m \) and \( n \) at point \( C \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel Lines**: 
  - Line \( l \) is parallel to line \( m \) (\( l \parallel m \)).
- **Intersecting Lines**: 
  - Line \( n \) intersects both \( l \) and \( m \) at points \( B \) and \( C \), respectively.
- **Angle Relationships**:
  - Since \( l \parallel m \), corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles are formed.
  - \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 5\) are corresponding angles.
  - \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 6\) are consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles).
  - \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) form a linear pair and are supplementary.
  - \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 4\) are vertical angles and are congruent.
  - \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 8\) are corresponding angles (since \( l \parallel m \)).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No specific numerical measurements are provided for the angles or lengths in the diagram. However, the relationships between the angles are determined by the geometric properties of parallel lines and intersecting transversals.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the angles that are supplementary to \(\angle 1\).
- Two angles are supplementary if their measures add up to \(180^\circ\).
- From the diagram, \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) form a linear pair and are therefore supplementary.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and properties visible in the diagram.
- The key relationships involve the parallel lines, the transversal, and the supplementary angles.
- The final list of angles supplementary to \(\angle 1\) will be derived from the predicates.
