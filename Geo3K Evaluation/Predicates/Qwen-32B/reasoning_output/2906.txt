================================================================================
QUESTION: Quadrilateral A B C D is a rectangle. Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is labeled.
  - Diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).
  - Points \(A, B, C, D\) are the vertices of the quadrilateral.
  - Point \(E\) is the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  - Angles are marked at vertices and along the diagonals:
    - \(\angle DAB = (2x + 1)^\circ\)
    - \(\angle ABC = (y^2)^\circ\)
    - \(\angle BCD = (3y + 10)^\circ\)
    - \(\angle CDA = (5x + 5)^\circ\)

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols are present at vertices \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\), indicating that \(ABCD\) is a rectangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and parallel:
    - \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\).
    - \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
  - Diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length:
    - \(AC = BD\).
  - Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other:
    - \(AE = EC\) and \(BE = ED\).
  - All interior angles of a rectangle are right angles (\(90^\circ\)):
    - \(\angle DAB = \angle ABC = \angle BCD = \angle CDA = 90^\circ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Variables**:
  - The angles at the vertices are expressed in terms of variables:
    - \(\angle DAB = (2x + 1)^\circ\)
    - \(\angle ABC = (y^2)^\circ\)
    - \(\angle BCD = (3y + 10)^\circ\)
    - \(\angle CDA = (5x + 5)^\circ\)
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, all interior angles must be \(90^\circ\). Therefore:
    - \(2x + 1 = 90\)
    - \(y^2 = 90\)
    - \(3y + 10 = 90\)
    - \(5x + 5 = 90\)

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the value of \(x\).
- From the analysis, we know that \(\angle DAB = 90^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  2x + 1 = 90
  \]
- Solving this equation will give us the value of \(x\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture the fact that \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, the equality of its diagonals, the bisection of diagonals, and the right angles at the vertices.
- Additionally, we need to represent the angle measurements in terms of variables and their equality to \(90^\circ\).
