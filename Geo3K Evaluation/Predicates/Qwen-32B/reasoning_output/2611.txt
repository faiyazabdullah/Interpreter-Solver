STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2611
================================================================================
QUESTION: \overrightarrow Q P and \overrightarrow Q R are opposite rays, and \overrightarrow Q T bisects \angle S Q R. If m \angle S Q R = 6 x + 8 and m \angle T Q R = 4 x - 14, find m \angle S Q T.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( P, Q, R, S, \) and \( T \).
- **Lines/Rays**: 
  - \(\overrightarrow{QP}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QR}\) are opposite rays, forming a straight line through point \( Q \).
  - \(\overrightarrow{QS}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QT}\) are rays originating from point \( Q \).
- **Angles**: 
  - \(\angle SQR\) is formed by rays \(\overrightarrow{QS}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QR}\).
  - \(\angle TQR\) is formed by rays \(\overrightarrow{QT}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QR}\).
  - \(\angle SQT\) is formed by rays \(\overrightarrow{QS}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QT}\).
- **Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle SQR = 6x + 8 \)
  - \( m\angle TQR = 4x - 14 \)
- **Special Markings**:
  - \(\overrightarrow{QT}\) bisects \(\angle SQR\), meaning \(\angle SQT = \angle TQR\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \(\overrightarrow{QP}\) and \(\overrightarrow{QR}\) are opposite rays, so they form a straight line.
- \(\overrightarrow{QT}\) bisects \(\angle SQR\), implying that \(\angle SQT = \angle TQR\).
- Since \(\angle SQR\) is composed of \(\angle SQT\) and \(\angle TQR\), we have:
  \[
  m\angle SQR = m\angle SQT + m\angle TQR
  \]

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given:
  - \( m\angle SQR = 6x + 8 \)
  - \( m\angle TQR = 4x - 14 \)
- Since \(\overrightarrow{QT}\) bisects \(\angle SQR\):
  \[
  m\angle SQT = m\angle TQR = 4x - 14
  \]
- Using the angle addition property:
  \[
  m\angle SQR = m\angle SQT + m\angle TQR
  \]
  Substituting the known expressions:
  \[
  6x + 8 = (4x - 14) + (4x - 14)
  \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle SQT \).
- To find \( m\angle SQT \), we need to solve for \( x \) using the equation derived from the angle bisector property and then substitute back to find \( m\angle SQT \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- Ensure predicates are atomic and do not include derived solutions.
