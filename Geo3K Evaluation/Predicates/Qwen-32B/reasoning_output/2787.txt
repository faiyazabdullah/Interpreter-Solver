================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present with center \( B \).
  - Points \( Q, R, S, T \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( QT \), \( QS \), \( RS \), and \( QR \) are chords or tangents related to the circle.
  
- **Labels and Measurements:**
  - Angles are marked:
    - \( \angle QRS = 71^\circ \)
    - \( \angle QTS = 106^\circ \)
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - No explicit right angles, parallel lines, or congruence marks are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( Q, R, S, T \) are points on the circumference of the circle centered at \( B \).
  - \( \angle QRS \) and \( \angle QTS \) are angles subtended by the same arc \( QS \) from different positions on the circle.
  - \( \angle QRS \) is an external angle formed by the intersection of tangents or secants.
  - The circle's properties (such as the measure of inscribed angles) will be key to solving the problem.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( \angle QRS = 71^\circ \)
  - \( \angle QTS = 106^\circ \)
  
- **Interpretation:**
  - \( \angle QRS \) is the angle between the lines \( QR \) and \( RS \).
  - \( \angle QTS \) is the angle between the lines \( QT \) and \( TS \).
  - These angles are related to the arcs they intercept on the circle.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective:**
  - Find \( m\widehat{QTS} \), the measure of the arc \( QTS \).
  
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
  - The measure of an angle formed by intersecting chords or tangents outside a circle can be used to determine arc measures.
  
- **Approach:**
  - Use the given angles to determine the measure of the arc \( QS \).
  - Use the circle's properties to find \( m\widehat{QTS} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify the points on the circle.
  - Indicate the angles and their measures.
  - Relate the angles to the arcs they intercept.
  
- **Key Relationships to Capture:**
  - The circle and its center \( B \).
  - The points \( Q, R, S, T \) lying on the circle.
  - The measures of \( \angle QRS \) and \( \angle QTS \).
  - The relationship between these angles and the arcs they intercept.
