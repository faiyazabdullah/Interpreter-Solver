STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2551
================================================================================
QUESTION: If X M = 4, X N = 6, and N Z = 9, find X Y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Points**: The diagram contains points \( X, M, N, Y, Z \).
- **Lines**: 
  - Line segments \( XM \), \( MN \), \( NZ \), and \( XY \) are clearly shown.
  - Lines \( XY \) and \( YZ \) form a larger triangle \( XYZ \).
  - Line \( MN \) appears to be a segment within triangle \( XYZ \).
- **Angles**:
  - Right angle symbols are marked at \( \angle XMY \) and \( \angle NMZ \), indicating that \( \angle XMY = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle NMZ = 90^\circ \).
- **Shapes**:
  - Triangles \( XMY \) and \( NMZ \) are formed by the lines and points.
  - Larger triangle \( XYZ \) is also present.
- **Measurements**:
  - \( XM = 4 \)
  - \( XN = 6 \)
  - \( NZ = 9 \)

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle XMY \) and \( \angle NMZ \) are right angles, implying that triangles \( XMY \) and \( NMZ \) are right triangles.
- **Proportional Relationships**:
  - Since \( M \) and \( N \) lie on \( XZ \), and both triangles share the same orientation with respect to \( XZ \), the triangles \( XMY \) and \( NMZ \) may have proportional sides due to similar right triangles.
- **Collinearity**:
  - Points \( X, M, N, Z \) are collinear along the line \( XZ \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- Given:
  - \( XM = 4 \)
  - \( XN = 6 \)
  - \( NZ = 9 \)
- Implications:
  - Since \( X, M, N, Z \) are collinear, we can determine:
    - \( MN = XN - XM = 6 - 4 = 2 \)
    - \( XZ = XN + NZ = 6 + 9 = 15 \)

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the length of \( XY \).
- To solve this, we need to use the properties of right triangles and the relationships between the segments \( XM, MN, \) and \( NZ \).
- Since \( \angle XMY \) and \( \angle NMZ \) are right angles, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangles \( XMY \) and \( NMZ \). Additionally, the similarity of triangles \( XMY \) and \( NMZ \) might provide a proportionality relationship that helps in determining \( XY \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates will capture the shapes, angles, lengths, and relationships between the elements.
- Avoid directly solving the problem; instead, focus on encoding the given information and relationships.
