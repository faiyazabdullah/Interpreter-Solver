REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The image contains several labeled points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \).
- **Lines**: Lines connect these points, forming various segments and angles.
- **Angles**: 
  - Angle \( \angle 1 \) is formed by lines \( BD \) and \( BF \).
  - Angle \( \angle 2 \) is formed by lines \( BA \) and \( BG \).
  - Angle \( \angle CBF \) is explicitly labeled as \( 37^\circ \).
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle ABG \), \( \angle DBF \), and \( \angle EBF \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Right Angles**:
  - \( \angle ABG \) is a right angle.
  - \( \angle DBF \) is a right angle.
  - \( \angle EBF \) is a right angle.
- **Linear Pair**:
  - Angles \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle CBF \) form a linear pair because they are adjacent and lie on a straight line \( BF \).
- **Complementary Angles**:
  - Since \( \angle DBF \) is a right angle, \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle DBF \) are complementary to \( \angle CBF \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**:
  - \( \angle CBF = 37^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 1 \).
- Since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle CBF \) form a linear pair, their measures sum to \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the geometric relationships and constraints using the provided guidelines.
- Ensure all visible information is captured without directly solving the problem.
