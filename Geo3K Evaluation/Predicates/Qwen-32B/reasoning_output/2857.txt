REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure shows a kite with vertices labeled \( F, G, H, J \).
  - The diagonals \( FG \) and \( HJ \) intersect at point \( A \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines \( FG \), \( GH \), \( HJ \), and \( JF \) form the sides of the kite.
  - Diagonals \( FA \) and \( AH \) are marked, with \( FA = 12 \) and \( AH = 15 \).
  - Diagonal \( FG \) is perpendicular to diagonal \( HJ \) at point \( A \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols indicate that \( FG \) and \( HJ \) are perpendicular at \( A \).
  - The kite has two pairs of adjacent equal sides: \( FG = GH \) and \( HJ = JF \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The kite is symmetric about its diagonal \( HJ \).
  - The diagonal \( HJ \) is a line of symmetry, and the diagonal \( FG \) is perpendicular to it.
  - The diagonals of a kite intersect at right angles.
  - The diagonal \( FG \) divides the kite into two congruent triangles: \( \triangle FGA \) and \( \triangle HGA \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The kite's properties ensure that the diagonals are perpendicular and that one diagonal bisects the other.
  - Since \( FG \) is perpendicular to \( HJ \), the segments \( FA \) and \( AG \) are equal, and similarly, \( HA \) and \( AJ \) are equal.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( FA = 12 \): One half of diagonal \( FG \).
  - \( AH = 15 \): One half of diagonal \( HJ \).
  - The full lengths of the diagonals are \( FG = 2 \times FA = 24 \) and \( HJ = 2 \times AH = 30 \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The diagonals divide the kite into four right triangles.
  - The lengths of the sides of the kite can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem in these right triangles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is being asked**:
  - The problem asks for the length of \( GH \), one of the sides of the kite.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - In a kite, the two pairs of adjacent sides are equal: \( FG = GH \) and \( HJ = JF \).
  - Using the right triangles formed by the diagonals, we can calculate the side lengths.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the kite and its components.
  - Specify the perpendicularity of the diagonals.
  - Indicate the equality of adjacent sides.
  - Use the given measurements and the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides.
