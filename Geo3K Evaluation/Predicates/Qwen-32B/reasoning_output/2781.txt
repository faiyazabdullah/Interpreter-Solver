REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure shows a quadrilateral \(ABCD\).
  - The quadrilateral has vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - There is a point \(E\) where the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect.
  - The angle at vertex \(B\) is labeled as \(m \angle ABC = 70^\circ\).

- **Lines and Diagonals**:
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\).
  - The diagonals appear to bisect each other, as is typical in a rhombus.

- **Labels and Measurements**:
  - The angle \(m \angle ABC = 70^\circ\) is explicitly given.
  - The angle labeled as \(m \angle 1\) is the angle formed by the intersection of the diagonals at point \(E\).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rhombus Properties**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, all sides are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
  - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
  - The diagonals also bisect the angles of the rhombus.

- **Angles and Diagonals**:
  - The diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\) and form four right angles at the intersection.
  - Each diagonal bisects the angles at the vertices it connects. For example, \(BD\) bisects \( \angle ABC \) and \( \angle ADC \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurement**:
  - \(m \angle ABC = 70^\circ\).

- **Derived Relationships**:
  - Since \(BD\) bisects \( \angle ABC \), we have:
    \[
    m \angle ABE = m \angle EBC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot m \angle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 70^\circ = 35^\circ.
    \]
  - The diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles, so \(m \angle 1 = 90^\circ\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(m \angle 1\).
- From the properties of a rhombus, we know that the diagonals intersect at right angles.
- Therefore, \(m \angle 1 = 90^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rhombus, its diagonals, the given angle, and the property that the diagonals intersect at right angles.
- The predicates should capture the geometric relationships without directly stating the final answer.
