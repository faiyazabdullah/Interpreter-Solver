REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is shown with center \( C \).
  - Points \( A \), \( J \), and \( K \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( A \) and \( J \) are endpoints of a diameter, and \( K \) is another point on the circle.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AJ \) is a diameter of the circle.
  - \( CK \) is a radius of the circle.
  - \( JK \) is an arc of the circle.

- **Angles**:
  - An angle \( \angle JCK \) is marked as \( 105^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The diameter \( AJ \) is labeled as \( 15 \, \text{cm} \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( AJ \) is a diameter of the circle, so its length is twice the radius.
  - \( C \) is the center of the circle.
  - \( CK \) is a radius of the circle.
  - \( \angle JCK \) subtends the arc \( JK \).
  - The arc length \( \widehat{JK} \) depends on the central angle \( \angle JCK \) and the radius of the circle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Diameter \( AJ = 15 \, \text{cm} \).
  - Radius \( r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \, \text{cm} \).
  - Central angle \( \angle JCK = 105^\circ \).

- **What Measurements Represent**:
  - The diameter \( AJ \) gives the radius of the circle.
  - The central angle \( \angle JCK \) determines the proportion of the circle's circumference that corresponds to the arc \( \widehat{JK} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - Find the length of the arc \( \widehat{JK} \).
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The length of an arc is given by the formula:
    \[
    \text{Arc Length} = \left( \frac{\text{Central Angle in Degrees}}{360^\circ} \right) \times 2\pi r
    \]
  - Here, the central angle is \( 105^\circ \) and the radius \( r = 7.5 \, \text{cm} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the circle and its properties.
  - Specify the points and their positions relative to the circle.
  - Indicate the diameter, radius, and central angle.
  - Relate the arc length to the central angle and radius.
