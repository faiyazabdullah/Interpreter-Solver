REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Shapes Identified**: 
  - Two rhombuses are shown.
  - The larger rhombus has vertices labeled \( A, B, C, D \).
  - The smaller rhombus is unlabeled but has a side length labeled as \( x \) mm.
  
- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - The side length of the larger rhombus is given as 40 mm.
  - The area of the larger rhombus is given as 400 mm².
  - The area of the smaller rhombus is given as 64 mm².
  
- **Special Markings**:
  - Both shapes are rhombuses, implying all sides are equal.
  - No additional angles or specific side lengths for the smaller rhombus are provided, except its area and a side length variable \( x \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Both shapes are rhombuses, so they have equal side lengths and are similar by definition.
  - Since the rhombuses are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.
  - The ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - Larger rhombus side length: 40 mm.
  - Larger rhombus area: 400 mm².
  - Smaller rhombus area: 64 mm².
  - Smaller rhombus side length: \( x \) mm (to be determined).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
  - Let the side length of the larger rhombus be \( s_1 = 40 \) mm and the side length of the smaller rhombus be \( s_2 = x \) mm.
  - The area ratio is given by:
    \[
    \frac{\text{Area of smaller rhombus}}{\text{Area of larger rhombus}} = \left( \frac{s_2}{s_1} \right)^2
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    \frac{64}{400} = \left( \frac{x}{40} \right)^2
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the side length \( x \) of the smaller rhombus.
- To find \( x \), we use the relationship between the areas and side lengths of similar figures:
  \[
  \left( \frac{x}{40} \right)^2 = \frac{64}{400}
  \]
  Solving this equation will give the value of \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric shapes, their properties, and the relationships between their areas and side lengths.
- The predicates should capture the similarity of the rhombuses, their areas, and the proportionality of their side lengths.
