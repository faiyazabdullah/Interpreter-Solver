QUESTION: Find Q S.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram shows a triangle \( \triangle RQS \).
  - The vertices are labeled as \( R \), \( Q \), and \( S \).

- **Lines and Sides**:
  - The sides of the triangle are:
    - \( QR \) with length \( 5x \),
    - \( RS \) with length \( 6x - 5 \),
    - \( QS \) with length \( 3x + 10 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The triangle has markings indicating that it is isosceles. Specifically:
    - The sides \( QR \) and \( RS \) have a double pink dash, indicating they are congruent.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruent Sides**:
  - Since \( QR \) and \( RS \) are marked as congruent, we have:
    \[
    QR = RS
    \]
    This implies:
    \[
    5x = 6x - 5
    \]

- **Isosceles Triangle**:
  - The triangle \( \triangle RQS \) is isosceles because two of its sides (\( QR \) and \( RS \)) are congruent.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - The lengths of the sides are expressed in terms of \( x \):
    - \( QR = 5x \),
    - \( RS = 6x - 5 \),
    - \( QS = 3x + 10 \).

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - From the congruence of \( QR \) and \( RS \):
    \[
    5x = 6x - 5
    \]
    Solving for \( x \):
    \[
    5x = 6x - 5 \implies 5 = x
    \]

- **Substitute \( x = 5 \)**:
  - \( QR = 5x = 5 \times 5 = 25 \),
  - \( RS = 6x - 5 = 6 \times 5 - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25 \),
  - \( QS = 3x + 10 = 3 \times 5 + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( QS \).
- From the analysis, we determined that \( QS = 3x + 10 \). Substituting \( x = 5 \):
  \[
  QS = 3(5) + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The key relationships are:
  - The triangle is isosceles.
  - The sides \( QR \) and \( RS \) are congruent.
  - The lengths of the sides are expressed in terms of \( x \).
