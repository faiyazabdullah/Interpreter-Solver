REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Shapes and Points**: 
  - Two triangles are shown: \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle FDG \).
  - Points labeled: \( A, B, C, P \) for \( \triangle ABC \); \( D, F, G, Q \) for \( \triangle FDG \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \): Sides \( AB, BC, CA \). The segment \( AP \) is part of \( AB \).
  - \( \triangle FDG \): Sides \( DF, FG, GD \). The segment \( FQ \) is part of \( FD \).

- **Measurements**:
  - In \( \triangle ABC \): \( AB = 15 \), and the side opposite \( \angle A \) is labeled \( x \).
  - In \( \triangle FDG \): \( DF = 12 \), \( FG = 8 \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - The triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle FDG \) have corresponding angles marked as congruent (indicated by arcs), suggesting they are similar.
  - Both triangles share the same orientation and structure, reinforcing the similarity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similarity**:
  - The problem states \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle FDG \), meaning the triangles are similar.
  - Corresponding sides are proportional, and corresponding angles are equal.

- **Proportional Sides**:
  - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is constant:
    \[
    \frac{AB}{FD} = \frac{BC}{DG} = \frac{CA}{GF}
    \]

- **Corresponding Angles**:
  - \( \angle A \cong \angle F \), \( \angle B \cong \angle D \), \( \angle C \cong \angle G \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 15 \)
  - \( DF = 12 \)
  - \( FG = 8 \)
  - \( CA = x \) (to be determined).

- **Proportions**:
  - The similarity ratio between \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle FDG \) is:
    \[
    \text{Scale Factor} = \frac{AB}{DF} = \frac{15}{12} = \frac{5}{4}
    \]
  - This scale factor applies to all corresponding sides.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of side \( CA \) in \( \triangle ABC \).
- Using the similarity property, we know:
  \[
  \frac{CA}{FG} = \frac{5}{4}
  \]
- Given \( FG = 8 \), we can solve for \( CA \):
  \[
  CA = x = \frac{5}{4} \times 8 = 10
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- Ensure that all constraints and relationships are captured without directly stating the solution.
