REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - Two circles are shown.
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \) are marked on and around the circles.
  - Lines connect these points, forming arcs and chords.
  - Angles and arcs are labeled with specific measures.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - \( m\widehat{FE} = 118^\circ \): The measure of the arc \( \widehat{FE} \).
  - \( m\widehat{AB} = 108^\circ \): The measure of the arc \( \widehat{AB} \).
  - \( m\angle EGB = 52^\circ \): The measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle EGB \).
  - \( m\angle EFB = 30^\circ \): The measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle EFB \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No explicit right-angle symbols, parallel lines, or congruence marks are visible.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Circles and Arcs:**
  - The larger circle contains points \( A, B, G \), and part of the arc \( \widehat{AB} \).
  - The smaller circle contains points \( C, F, E \), and part of the arc \( \widehat{CF} \).
  - Arcs \( \widehat{FE} \) and \( \widehat{CF} \) are part of the smaller circle.
  - Arc \( \widehat{AB} \) is part of the larger circle.

- **Inscribed Angles:**
  - \( \angle EGB \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( \widehat{EB} \) in the larger circle.
  - \( \angle EFB \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( \widehat{EF} \) in the smaller circle.

- **Interactions:**
  - Point \( G \) lies on both circles, suggesting it is a common point.
  - Chords and lines connect points across the circles, forming relationships between arcs and angles.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Arc Measures:**
  - \( m\widehat{FE} = 118^\circ \): The arc \( \widehat{FE} \) in the smaller circle.
  - \( m\widehat{AB} = 108^\circ \): The arc \( \widehat{AB} \) in the larger circle.

- **Angle Measures:**
  - \( m\angle EGB = 52^\circ \): An inscribed angle in the larger circle.
  - \( m\angle EFB = 30^\circ \): An inscribed angle in the smaller circle.

- **Relationships:**
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc.
  - Therefore:
    - For \( \angle EGB \): \( m\angle EGB = \frac{1}{2} \times m\widehat{EB} \Rightarrow 52^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \times m\widehat{EB} \).
    - For \( \angle EFB \): \( m\angle EFB = \frac{1}{2} \times m\widehat{EF} \Rightarrow 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \times m\widehat{EF} \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The problem asks for \( m\widehat{CF} \), the measure of the arc \( \widehat{CF} \) in the smaller circle.
- To find \( m\widehat{CF} \):
  1. Use the fact that the total measure of a circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  2. Use the relationship between inscribed angles and their subtended arcs.
  3. Relate the given arc measures and angles to determine \( m\widehat{CF} \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates for Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - Define points, lines, arcs, and circles.
  - Capture the relationships between inscribed angles and their subtended arcs.

- **Predicates for Measurements:**
  - Use the given arc and angle measures.
  - Relate the measures using the inscribed angle theorem.

- **Completeness Check:**
  - Ensure all visible relationships and measurements are represented.
  - Avoid including derived solutions or the final answer.
