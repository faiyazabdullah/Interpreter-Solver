### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: The image shows a triangle \( \triangle RST \).
- **Points**: The vertices of the triangle are labeled \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).
- **Lines**: The sides of the triangle are:
  - \( RS \) with length \( 2z - 15 \),
  - \( RT \) with length 9,
  - \( ST \) with length 7.
- **Special Markings**: The triangle has two small arcs marking angles at \( S \) and \( T \), indicating that these angles are congruent. This suggests that \( \triangle RST \) is isosceles with \( RS = RT \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Congruent Angles**: The arcs at \( S \) and \( T \) indicate that \( \angle RST \cong \angle RTS \).
- **Isosceles Triangle**: Since the base angles \( \angle RST \) and \( \angle RTS \) are congruent, \( \triangle RST \) is isosceles.
- **Congruent Sides**: In an isosceles triangle, the sides opposite congruent angles are equal. Therefore, \( RS = RT \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( RS = 2z - 15 \)
  - \( RT = 9 \)
  - \( ST = 7 \)
- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( \triangle RST \) is isosceles and \( \angle RST \cong \angle RTS \), it follows that \( RS = RT \). Therefore, \( 2z - 15 = 9 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( z \).
- To find \( z \), we use the relationship \( RS = RT \), which gives us the equation \( 2z - 15 = 9 \).
- Solving this equation will yield the value of \( z \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The key relationships are:
  - \( \triangle RST \) is isosceles.
  - \( RS = RT \).
  - The lengths of the sides are given as \( RS = 2z - 15 \), \( RT = 9 \), and \( ST = 7 \).
- Predicates should capture these relationships without directly solving for \( z \).
