REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram shows a rectangle \(WXYZ\).
  - There is a diagonal \(WY\) and another diagonal \(ZX\), intersecting at point \(P\).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \(ZP\) and \(PY\) are segments of the diagonal \(ZY\).
  - \(WX\) is one side of the rectangle.
  - \(ZY\) is another side of the rectangle.

- **Measurements**:
  - \(ZP = 4x - 9\)
  - \(PY = 2x + 5\)

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right-angle symbols are present at vertices \(Z\), \(W\), \(X\), and \(Y\), indicating that \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle.
  - The diagonals \(WY\) and \(ZX\) intersect at \(P\), and since it is a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \(WXYZ\) is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal (\(WX = ZY\) and \(WZ = XY\)).
  - Diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length (\(WY = ZX\)).
  - Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other (\(ZP = PY\) and \(WP = PX\)).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - Since \(P\) is the intersection point of the diagonals, \(P\) is the midpoint of both diagonals.
  - The total length of diagonal \(ZY\) is the sum of \(ZP\) and \(PY\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \(ZP = 4x - 9\)
  - \(PY = 2x + 5\)
  - The total length of diagonal \(ZY\) is \(ZP + PY = (4x - 9) + (2x + 5)\).

- **Relationships**:
  - Since \(P\) is the midpoint, \(ZP = PY\). However, we need to use the total length of the diagonal to find \(x\) and then determine \(ZX\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - We need to find the length of \(ZX\), which is the same as the length of \(WY\) because the diagonals of a rectangle are equal.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The diagonals of a rectangle are equal (\(WY = ZX\)).
  - The total length of diagonal \(ZY\) is \(ZP + PY\).

- **Information Needed**:
  - Solve for \(x\) using the given expressions for \(ZP\) and \(PY\).
  - Use the total length of diagonal \(ZY\) to find \(ZX\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the rectangle and its properties.
  - Express the relationships between the segments \(ZP\) and \(PY\).
  - Use the fact that the diagonals are equal and bisect each other.
