STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2757
================================================================================
QUESTION: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 4 p + 15, m \angle 3 = 3 p - 10 and m \angle 4 = 6 r + 5. Find the value of p.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows two intersecting lines forming four angles at the intersection point \( A \).
  - Points labeled: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K \).
  - Angles are labeled as \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4 \).

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations**:
  - \( m\angle 1 = 4p + 15 \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 3p - 10 \)
  - \( m\angle 4 = 6r + 5 \)

- **Special Markings**:
  - The angles \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are marked congruent, indicating they are vertical angles.
  - The angles \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 4 \) are also marked congruent, indicating they are vertical angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Vertical Angles**:
  - Vertical angles are always congruent. Therefore:
    - \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \)
    - \( \angle 2 \cong \angle 4 \)

- **Linear Pair**:
  - Adjacent angles forming a linear pair (e.g., \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \)) are supplementary. Therefore:
    - \( m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 = 180^\circ \)
    - \( m\angle 3 + m\angle 4 = 180^\circ \)

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( m\angle 1 = 4p + 15 \)
  - \( m\angle 3 = 3p - 10 \)
  - \( m\angle 4 = 6r + 5 \)

- **Relationships**:
  - Since \( \angle 1 \cong \angle 3 \), we have:
    \[
    m\angle 1 = m\angle 3 \implies 4p + 15 = 3p - 10
    \]
  - Solving this equation will give us the value of \( p \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( p \).
- To find \( p \), we use the fact that vertical angles are congruent, i.e., \( m\angle 1 = m\angle 3 \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the figure.
- Predicates should capture the congruence of vertical angles and the given angle measures.
