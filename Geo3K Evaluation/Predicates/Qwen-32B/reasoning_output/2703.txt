REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are labeled.
  - Line segments \( AC \), \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CD \) are visible.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( AC = 10 \).
  - \( AB = 14 \).
  - \( BC = 18 \).
  - \( BD = x \) (to be determined).
  
- **Special Markings:**
  - There is no indication of any specific angle measures or parallel/perpendicular lines.
  - The point \( D \) lies on \( BC \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ACD \) is a smaller triangle within \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( D \) divides \( BC \) into two segments: \( BD \) and \( DC \).
  - Since \( D \) is on \( BC \), the total length of \( BC \) is the sum of \( BD \) and \( DC \):
    \[
    BD + DC = BC.
    \]
  - The problem appears to involve the application of similarity or proportionality principles, as \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) share the same angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( AC = 10 \).
  - \( AB = 14 \).
  - \( BC = 18 \).
  - \( BD = x \) (unknown).
  - \( DC = 18 - x \) (since \( BD + DC = 18 \)).
  
- **Implications:**
  - The lengths of the sides of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) suggest that they might be similar triangles, which would imply proportional side lengths.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the value of \( x \), which is the length of \( BD \).
  
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - The similarity of triangles \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) suggests that corresponding sides are proportional.
  - The proportionality can be used to set up an equation involving \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangles, points, and lines.
  - Capture the measurements and relationships between the triangles.
  - Use similarity properties to establish proportional relationships.
  
- **Plan:**
  - Define the triangles and their components.
  - Use the similarity property to relate the sides of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Set up the necessary equations to solve for \( x \).
