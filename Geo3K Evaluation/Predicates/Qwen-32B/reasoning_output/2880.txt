================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is centered at point \( P \).
  - Points \( J, K, L, M, N \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Line segments \( NP \) and \( PL \) intersect at \( P \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - \( \angle MPL = 65^\circ \).
  - \( NP \perp PL \) (indicated by the right angle symbol at \( \angle NPL \)).

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( NP \) is perpendicular to \( PL \).
  - \( N \) and \( M \) are marked with red dots, possibly indicating specific positions or symmetry.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( NP \perp PL \): Line segment \( NP \) is perpendicular to line segment \( PL \).
  - \( N, P, L \) form a right triangle \( \triangle NPL \) with \( \angle NPL = 90^\circ \).
  - \( M \) and \( N \) are points on the circle, and \( MP \) and \( NP \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( \angle MPL = 65^\circ \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( \widehat{ML} \).

- **Implied Properties**:
  - Since \( NP \perp PL \), \( \angle NPL = 90^\circ \).
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Thus, \( \angle MPL = 65^\circ \) implies that the measure of arc \( \widehat{ML} \) is \( 2 \times 65^\circ = 130^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle MPL = 65^\circ \).
  - \( \angle NPL = 90^\circ \) (since \( NP \perp PL \)).
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{ML} \) is \( 130^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**: Find \( m\widehat{NKJ} \).
- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
  - The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  - To find \( m\widehat{NKJ} \), we need to determine the measures of arcs \( \widehat{NK} \) and \( \widehat{KJ} \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships**:
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Define the points on the circle and their relationships.
  - Capture the perpendicularity and angle measurements.
  - Use the inscribed angle theorem and arc relationships.
