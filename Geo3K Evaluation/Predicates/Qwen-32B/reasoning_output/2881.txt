================================================================================
QUESTION: Find E G if G is the incenter of \triangle A B C.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is present.
  - Point \( G \) is marked inside \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( E \), \( F \), and \( D \) are marked along the sides of \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Line segments \( BE \), \( BG \), and \( CF \) are drawn from vertices to internal points.
  - Line segment \( GD \) is perpendicular to \( AC \).

- **Angles:**
  - Right angles are marked at points \( E \), \( G \), and \( D \).
  - \( \angle BEG \) and \( \angle CGF \) are right angles.
  - \( \angle GDC \) is a right angle.

- **Measurements:**
  - Side \( BC = 12 \).
  - Side \( AC = 13 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( G \) is labeled as the incenter of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - \( E \), \( F \), and \( D \) appear to be points where the angle bisectors meet the sides of the triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangle Properties:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle because \( \angle B \) is a right angle (implied by the presence of the incenter and perpendicular segments).
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Incenter Properties:**
  - \( G \) is the incenter of \( \triangle ABC \), meaning it is the intersection of the angle bisectors of \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The incenter is equidistant from all three sides of the triangle.
  - \( GD \), \( GE \), and \( GF \) are perpendicular distances from \( G \) to the sides \( AC \), \( AB \), and \( BC \), respectively.

- **Perpendicular Relationships:**
  - \( GD \perp AC \), \( GE \perp AB \), and \( GF \perp BC \).
  - These perpendicular segments represent the inradius of the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( BC = 12 \).
  - \( AC = 13 \).

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( AB \):
    \[
    AB = \sqrt{AC^2 - BC^2} = \sqrt{13^2 - 12^2} = \sqrt{169 - 144} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
    \]
  - Therefore, \( AB = 5 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length \( EG \).
- Since \( G \) is the incenter, \( EG \) is one of the perpendicular distances from the incenter to a side of the triangle.
- To find \( EG \), we need to determine the inradius \( r \) of \( \triangle ABC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- The predicates will include the triangle, its sides, the incenter, the perpendicular distances, and the relationships between these elements.
