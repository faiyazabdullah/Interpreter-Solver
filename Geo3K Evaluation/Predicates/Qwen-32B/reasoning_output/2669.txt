### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains straight lines and points.
  - Key points: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \).
  - Lines: \( DE \), \( EF \), \( AF \), and vertical segments from \( A \) to \( DE \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - The angle at point \( D \) is labeled as \( x^\circ \).
  - There is a right angle symbol at \( \angle AFE \), indicating \( \angle AFE = 90^\circ \).
  - Line \( EF \) is perpendicular to \( DE \) and \( AF \) is vertical, forming a right angle with \( DE \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right angle symbol at \( \angle AFE \) indicates perpendicularity.
  - The alignment of points suggests symmetry and alignment in the figure.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( DE \) is a horizontal line, and \( EF \) is perpendicular to \( DE \), making \( \triangle AEF \) a right triangle.
  - \( AF \) is vertical and forms a right angle with \( DE \).
  - Since \( \angle AFE = 90^\circ \), \( AF \) is perpendicular to \( EF \).
  - The angle \( x \) at \( D \) appears to be related to the alignment of the horizontal line \( DE \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - \( DE \) is parallel to \( EF \) horizontally.
  - \( AF \) is perpendicular to both \( DE \) and \( EF \).
  - The right angle at \( \angle AFE \) confirms the perpendicularity.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - No specific numerical lengths are given for segments.
  - The angle \( x \) is the primary unknown.

- **What Measurements Represent:**
  - The angle \( x \) at \( D \) is part of the horizontal line \( DE \).
  - Since \( DE \) is horizontal and \( AF \) is vertical, the angle \( x \) is effectively the angle formed by the horizontal line \( DE \) and the vertical line extending from \( A \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks for the value of \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The horizontal line \( DE \) forms a straight line with \( x \) as part of it.
  - Since \( AF \) is vertical and perpendicular to \( DE \), the angle \( x \) is simply the angle of the horizontal line, which is \( 180^\circ \) minus the right angle formed by the vertical line.

- **Information Needed:**
  - The fact that \( DE \) is horizontal and \( AF \) is vertical is sufficient to determine \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the horizontal and vertical lines.
  - Indicate the right angle at \( \angle AFE \).
  - Capture the alignment and perpendicularity relationships.
  - Use these relationships to infer the value of \( x \).
