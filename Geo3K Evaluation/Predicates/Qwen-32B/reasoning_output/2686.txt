REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Additional points \( D \) and \( C \) are marked on the base \( AB \).
  - Lines \( AD \), \( DC \), and \( CB \) form the base segments.
  - Line \( AB \) is horizontal, and line \( AD \) is vertical.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( DB \) (marked with a right angle symbol).
  - \( DC \) and \( CB \) are marked with tick marks indicating they are equal in length.
  - \( AD \) is also marked with a tick mark, indicating its length is equal to some segment.

- **Angles**:
  - \( \angle ADC = 92^\circ \) is explicitly marked.
  - \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \) (right angle).

- **Measurements**:
  - No explicit lengths are given, but relative equalities are indicated by tick marks.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Perpendicular Relationship**:
  - \( AD \perp DB \) because \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \).
  
- **Congruent Segments**:
  - \( DC \cong CB \) (indicated by tick marks on segments \( DC \) and \( CB \)).
  - \( AD \cong \) some unspecified segment (indicated by tick marks).

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - \( \angle ADC = 92^\circ \) is given.
  - Since \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \), \( \angle BDC = \angle ADC - \angle ADB = 92^\circ - 90^\circ = 2^\circ \).

- **Triangle Properties**:
  - \( \triangle ADC \) is a triangle with \( \angle ADC = 92^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle BDC \) is a triangle with \( \angle BDC = 2^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Explicit Measurements**:
  - \( \angle ADC = 92^\circ \).
  - \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \).

- **Implied Measurements**:
  - \( \angle BDC = 2^\circ \) (as derived above).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\angle ABC \).
- To find \( m\angle ABC \), we need to use the fact that \( DC \cong CB \) and the angles in \( \triangle BDC \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible relationships, including perpendicularity, congruence, and angle measures.
- The key is to capture the structure of the triangle and the given angle \( \angle ADC = 92^\circ \).
