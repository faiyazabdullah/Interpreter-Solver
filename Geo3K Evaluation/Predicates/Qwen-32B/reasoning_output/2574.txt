================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - A circle is depicted with center \( K \).
  - Points \( G \), \( H \), \( J \), and \( L \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Line segment \( GJ \) passes through the center \( K \), indicating it is a diameter of the circle.
  - Point \( H \) lies on the circumference, and \( \angle GHJ \) is marked as \( 122^\circ \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{GH} \) is \( 122^\circ \).
  - \( GJ \) is explicitly stated as the diameter of the circle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence symbols are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - Since \( GJ \) is the diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
  - \( \angle GHJ \) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \( \widehat{GH} \). The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
  - The total circumference of the circle is divided into arcs \( \widehat{GH} \), \( \widehat{HJ} \), and \( \widehat{GLJ} \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The sum of the measures of arcs in a full circle is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{GH} \) is given as \( 122^\circ \).
  - Since \( GJ \) is the diameter, arc \( \widehat{GJ} \) measures \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( \text{Measure of } \widehat{GH} = 122^\circ \).
  - \( \text{Measure of } \widehat{GJ} = 180^\circ \) (since \( GJ \) is the diameter).

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{HJ} \) can be calculated as \( 180^\circ - 122^\circ = 58^\circ \).
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \) is the sum of arcs \( \widehat{GH} \) and \( \widehat{HJ} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of arc \( \widehat{GLJ} \).
- To find \( \widehat{GLJ} \), we need to use the fact that the total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \) and the relationships between the arcs.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements using predicates.
- Predicates will capture the following:
  - The circle and its center.
  - The diameter \( GJ \).
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{GH} \).
  - The relationships between the arcs.
