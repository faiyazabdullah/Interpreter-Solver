STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2771
================================================================================
QUESTION: Solve for x in the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The figure appears to be a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with an extended side forming a pentagon \(ABCDE\).
  - The points are labeled \(A, B, C, D,\) and \(E\).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The sides of the quadrilateral are labeled with algebraic expressions:
    - \(CD = 6x + 4\)
    - \(AD = 5x + 10\)
    - \(AE = 10x - 2\)

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols are present at vertices \(A\) and \(E\), indicating that \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle DEB\) are right angles.
  - The lines \(AB\) and \(DE\) appear to be parallel, as they are both perpendicular to the same line segment.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Parallel and Perpendicular Relationships**:
  - Since \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle DEB\) are right angles, lines \(AB\) and \(DE\) are parallel (\(AB \parallel DE\)).
  - The perpendicularity implies that the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) could be a rectangle or a right trapezoid.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The figure suggests that \(ABCD\) might be a rectangle because of the right angles and parallel sides.
  - The extended side \(AE\) forms a right triangle with \(DE\) and \(BE\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \(CD = 6x + 4\)
  - \(AD = 5x + 10\)
  - \(AE = 10x - 2\)

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - In a rectangle or right trapezoid, opposite sides are equal if it is a rectangle. However, since \(AE\) extends beyond the quadrilateral, we need to use the properties of similar triangles or congruent segments to relate these expressions.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks us to solve for \(x\).
  - To do this, we need to find a relationship between the given expressions for the sides of the figure.

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - If \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, then \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
  - Since \(AE\) is an extension, we need to use the properties of the right triangle formed by \(DE\) and \(BE\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the quadrilateral and its properties.
  - Capture the parallel and perpendicular relationships.
  - Include the measurements and their relationships.
  - Use the right angle and parallelism constraints to form equations.
