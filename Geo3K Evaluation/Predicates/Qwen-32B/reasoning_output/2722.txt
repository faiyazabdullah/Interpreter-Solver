================================================================================
QUESTION: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two triangles are shown: one larger triangle with vertices \( A \) and \( B \), and a smaller similar triangle.
  - Both triangles are right triangles (indicated by the right angle symbols).
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - In the larger triangle:
    - One leg is labeled as 12 units.
    - Another leg is labeled as 20 units.
    - The hypotenuse is labeled as \( 2x \).
  - In the smaller triangle:
    - One leg is labeled as 12 units.
    - Another leg is labeled as 15 units.
    - The hypotenuse is labeled as \( y + 4 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Corresponding sides of the two triangles are marked with arcs, indicating similarity.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similarity:**
  - The two triangles are similar because corresponding angles are equal (as indicated by the right angles and arc markings).
  - This implies that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

- **Right Triangles:**
  - Both triangles are right triangles, as indicated by the right angle symbols.
  - The hypotenuse is the longest side in each triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - Larger triangle:
    - Leg 1: 12 units.
    - Leg 2: 20 units.
    - Hypotenuse: \( 2x \).
  - Smaller triangle:
    - Leg 1: 12 units.
    - Leg 2: 15 units.
    - Hypotenuse: \( y + 4 \).

- **Relationships:**
  - Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides must be equal:
    \[
    \frac{\text{Hypotenuse of larger triangle}}{\text{Hypotenuse of smaller triangle}} = \frac{\text{Leg 1 of larger triangle}}{\text{Leg 1 of smaller triangle}} = \frac{\text{Leg 2 of larger triangle}}{\text{Leg 2 of smaller triangle}}
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \).
- To find \( y \), we use the similarity property of the triangles and the given measurements.
- We need to set up proportions based on the corresponding sides and solve for \( y \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and their properties.
- Capture the similarity relationship and the proportionalities of corresponding sides.
- Include all given measurements and their relationships.
