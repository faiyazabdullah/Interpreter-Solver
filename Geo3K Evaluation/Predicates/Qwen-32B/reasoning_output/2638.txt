REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: \( J, K, L, M, N \)
- **Lines**: \( JK, KL, LN, NM, ML, LJ, KN \)
- **Angles**: 
  - \( \angle JKL = 18^\circ \)
  - \( \angle KLN = 25^\circ \)
  - \( \angle LNM = 20^\circ \)
  - \( \angle JKN = 130^\circ \)
- **Shapes**: 
  - \( \triangle KLN \) is labeled as isosceles.
  - \( \triangle LMN \) is labeled as isosceles.
- **Special Markings**:
  - Congruent sides in \( \triangle KLN \) and \( \triangle LMN \) are marked with tick marks.
  - \( \angle JKN \) is explicitly given as \( 130^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle KLN \) is isosceles, so \( KL = LN \).
  - \( \triangle LMN \) is isosceles, so \( LM = MN \).
- **Angles**:
  - The sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The given angles \( \angle KLN \), \( \angle LNM \), and \( \angle JKL \) will help determine other angles.
- **Congruent Sides**:
  - In \( \triangle KLN \), \( KL = LN \).
  - In \( \triangle LMN \), \( LM = MN \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( \angle JKL = 18^\circ \)
  - \( \angle KLN = 25^\circ \)
  - \( \angle LNM = 20^\circ \)
  - \( \angle JKN = 130^\circ \)
- **Implications**:
  - Since \( \triangle KLN \) is isosceles, \( \angle LKN = \angle LNK \).
  - Similarly, since \( \triangle LMN \) is isosceles, \( \angle LNM = \angle MLN \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle J \).
- To find \( \angle J \), we need to use the given angles and the properties of isosceles triangles to determine the remaining angles in the figure.
- Key relationships:
  - The sum of angles around point \( K \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The sum of angles in \( \triangle KLN \) and \( \triangle LMN \) must be used to find intermediate angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will include:
  - Shapes and points.
  - Angles and their measures.
  - Congruence of sides in isosceles triangles.
  - Relationships between angles around point \( K \).
