================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The image contains a combination of triangles and a straight line.
  - Key points: \( R \), \( L \), \( T \), \( W \), \( S \).
  - Triangles: \( \triangle RTL \) and \( \triangle RLS \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Line segments: \( RL \), \( RT \), \( RS \), \( RW \), \( WS \), \( LT \).

- **Angles and Markings**:
  - Right angles are marked at \( \angle RTL \) and \( \angle LWS \).
  - Congruent marks indicate equal segments or angles.

- **Measurements**:
  - \( RL = 5 \)
  - \( RT = 9 \)
  - \( WS = 6 \)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle RTL \) is a right triangle with \( \angle RTL \) as the right angle.
  - \( \triangle RLS \) is a larger triangle containing \( \triangle RTL \).
  
- **Parallel and Perpendicular Relationships**:
  - Since \( \angle LWS \) is a right angle, \( LW \) is perpendicular to \( WS \).
  - The line segment \( RW \) lies on the same horizontal line as \( RS \).

- **Congruence and Proportionality**:
  - The configuration suggests similar triangles due to the shared angles and right angles.
  - The segments \( RL \), \( RT \), and \( RW \) are part of the larger triangle \( \triangle RLS \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( RL = 5 \)
  - \( RT = 9 \)
  - \( WS = 6 \)

- **Unknowns**:
  - The length of \( RW \) needs to be determined.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**:
  - Find the length of \( RW \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The right angles and similar triangles suggest the use of proportions or the Pythagorean theorem.
  - The key is to leverage the relationships between the segments \( RL \), \( RT \), and \( WS \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Shapes and Points**:
  - Define the triangles and points explicitly.
  
- **Predicates for Lines and Segments**:
  - Specify the lengths of given segments and their relationships.
  
- **Predicates for Angles**:
  - Indicate the right angles and congruences.
  
- **Predicates for Relationships**:
  - Use similarity or proportionality to connect the known and unknown segments.
