================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is centered at point \( F \).
  - Points \( J, K, G, M, H, L \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( JG \), \( HK \), \( LM \), and others are chords or radii of the circle.
  - \( FH \) and \( FL \) are radii of the circle.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( FH \cong FL \): Radii of the circle are congruent.
  - \( FK = 17 \): The length of the radius \( FK \) is 17.
  - \( HL = 8 \): The length of the segment \( HL \) is 8.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbol at \( \angle FLK \): Indicates \( FL \perp KL \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - All points \( J, K, G, M, H, L \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Radii \( FH \), \( FL \), and \( FJ \) are equal in length because they are radii of the same circle.

- **Congruence and Perpendicularity:**
  - \( FH \cong FL \): Radii are congruent.
  - \( FL \perp KL \): The radius \( FL \) is perpendicular to the chord \( KL \).

- **Chords and Symmetry:**
  - Since \( FH \cong FL \) and \( F \) is the center, the circle is symmetric about the line through \( F \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( FK = 17 \): The radius of the circle is 17.
  - \( HL = 8 \): The length of segment \( HL \) is 8.

- **Implications:**
  - Since \( F \) is the center, \( FK \), \( FH \), and \( FL \) are all radii of the circle, so their lengths are all 17.
  - The perpendicular from the center \( F \) to the chord \( KL \) bisects \( KL \). Thus, \( HL = LK/2 = 8 \), so \( KL = 16 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks us to find the length of \( JG \).
- To solve this, we need to use the properties of the circle and the given measurements.
- Since \( F \) is the center and \( JG \) is a chord, we can use the Pythagorean theorem or properties of the circle to find \( JG \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will include circle properties, congruences, perpendicularity, and measurements.
