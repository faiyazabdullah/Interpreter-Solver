================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- **Lines**: 
  - Line segments AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG.
  - Lines intersect at specific points.
- **Angles**:
  - Right angles are marked at ∠BCD and ∠CDE.
  - ∠BAC is explicitly given as 38°.
- **Measurements**:
  - BC = 5.
  - DC = 5.
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angle symbols indicate perpendicularity at ∠BCD and ∠CDE.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Perpendicularity**:
  - Line segments BC and CD are perpendicular (∠BCD is a right angle).
  - Line segments CD and DE are perpendicular (∠CDE is a right angle).
- **Congruence**:
  - Segments BC and CD have equal lengths (both are 5 units), suggesting symmetry or specific geometric configurations.
- **Triangles**:
  - Triangle ABC involves the given angle ∠BAC = 38°.
  - Triangle BCD is a right triangle with ∠BCD = 90°.
  - Triangle CDE is a right triangle with ∠CDE = 90°.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - BC = 5.
  - DC = 5.
  - m∠BAC = 38°.
- **Implications**:
  - Since BC = DC, triangle BCD is isosceles with BC = CD.
  - The right angles at ∠BCD and ∠CDE suggest that the configuration might involve perpendicular bisectors or specific trigonometric relationships.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠DAC.
- To find m∠DAC, we need to analyze the relationships between the angles and lines in the diagram:
  - ∠BAC is given as 38°.
  - The right angles at ∠BCD and ∠CDE introduce perpendicularity constraints.
  - The equality of BC and DC suggests symmetry, which may help in determining the position of point D relative to line AC.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints.
- Predicates will include descriptions of points, lines, angles, perpendicularity, and congruence.
- The goal is to provide enough information for another system to solve for m∠DAC without directly stating the solution.
