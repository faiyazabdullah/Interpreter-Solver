STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2598
================================================================================

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - Two triangles are visible: \(\triangle R U W\) and \(\triangle S T V\).
  - Points labeled are \(R, S, T, U, V, W\).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - Lines connecting the points form the sides of the triangles:
    - \(\triangle R U W\) has sides \(RU\), \(RW\), and \(UW\).
    - \(\triangle S T V\) has sides \(ST\), \(SV\), and \(TV\).

- **Visible Measurements**:
  - \(ST = 24\)
  - \(VS = 12\)
  - \(VT = 18\)
  - \(UW = 21\)

- **Annotations**:
  - The problem states that \(\triangle R U W \sim \triangle S T V\), indicating similarity between the two triangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similarity**:
  - Since \(\triangle R U W \sim \triangle S T V\), corresponding sides are proportional, and corresponding angles are equal.
  - This implies:
    \[
    \frac{RU}{ST} = \frac{RW}{SV} = \frac{UW}{TV}
    \]

- **Corresponding Sides**:
  - \(RU\) corresponds to \(ST\),
  - \(RW\) corresponds to \(SV\),
  - \(UW\) corresponds to \(TV\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(ST = 24\)
  - \(VS = 12\)
  - \(VT = 18\)
  - \(UW = 21\)

- **Unknowns**:
  - We need to find the lengths of \(RU\) and \(RW\) to compute the perimeter of \(\triangle R U W\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**:
  - Find the perimeter of \(\triangle R U W\).
  - The perimeter is given by:
    \[
    Perimeter(\triangle R U W) = RU + RW + UW
    \]
  - We know \(UW = 21\). To find \(RU\) and \(RW\), we use the similarity ratio.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Capture Relationships**:
  - Triangles and their sides.
  - Similarity relationship between the triangles.
  - Corresponding side lengths and proportions.
  - Given measurements.
