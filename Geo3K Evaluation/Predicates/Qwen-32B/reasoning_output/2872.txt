REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - The image shows a circle with center \( O \) (implied but not explicitly labeled).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - There is an arc \( \widehat{BC} \) subtending an inscribed angle \( \angle 1 \) at point \( D \).

- **Visible Measurements and Labels:**
  - The arc \( \widehat{BC} \) is labeled with a central angle measurement of \( 218^\circ \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence symbols are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - The points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) form a cyclic quadrilateral since they lie on the circumference of the same circle.
  - The arc \( \widehat{BC} \) is part of the circle, and its central angle is \( 218^\circ \).
  - The inscribed angle \( \angle 1 \) subtends the same arc \( \widehat{BC} \). By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - The central angle subtending arc \( \widehat{BC} \) is \( 218^\circ \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Therefore, the measure of \( \angle 1 \) is:
    \[
    \text{Measure of } \angle 1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 218^\circ = 109^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is being asked?**
  - The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The Inscribed Angle Theorem is key here, as it relates the measure of the inscribed angle to the central angle subtending the same arc.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the circle and its properties.
  - Indicate the points lying on the circle.
  - Specify the arc and its central angle.
  - Relate the inscribed angle to the arc and central angle using the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
