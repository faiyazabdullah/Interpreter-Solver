STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2520
================================================================================
QUESTION: A B \perp D C and G H \perp F E. If \triangle A C D \sim \triangle G E F, find A B.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - Two triangles are shown: \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle GEF \).
  - Both triangles have altitudes drawn from the top vertex to the base, forming right angles.
  - The points are labeled as follows:
    - \( \triangle ACD \): Points \( A, B, C, D \).
    - \( \triangle GEF \): Points \( G, H, E, F \).

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - In \( \triangle ACD \):
    - \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( DC \).
    - \( AB \) is the altitude of \( \triangle ACD \).
  - In \( \triangle GEF \):
    - \( GH \) is perpendicular to \( FE \).
    - \( GH \) is the altitude of \( \triangle GEF \).

- **Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 4.4 \) (altitude of \( \triangle ACD \)).
  - \( GH = 3.15 \) (altitude of \( \triangle GEF \)).
  - \( GE = 6.3 \) (hypotenuse of \( \triangle GEF \)).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles are marked at \( B \) and \( H \), indicating \( AB \perp DC \) and \( GH \perp FE \).
  - The triangles are similar (\( \triangle ACD \sim \triangle GEF \)).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similar Triangles**:
  - \( \triangle ACD \sim \triangle GEF \) implies corresponding angles are equal, and corresponding sides are proportional.
  - Since both triangles have right angles, they are similar right triangles.

- **Perpendicular Relationships**:
  - \( AB \perp DC \) in \( \triangle ACD \).
  - \( GH \perp FE \) in \( \triangle GEF \).

- **Proportional Sides**:
  - The similarity ratio between \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle GEF \) can be used to relate their corresponding sides, including the altitudes.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( AB = 4.4 \) (altitude of \( \triangle ACD \)).
  - \( GH = 3.15 \) (altitude of \( \triangle GEF \)).
  - \( GE = 6.3 \) (hypotenuse of \( \triangle GEF \)).

- **Inferred Relationships**:
  - The similarity ratio between \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle GEF \) is determined by the ratio of their corresponding sides.
  - Since \( AB \) and \( GH \) are corresponding altitudes, their ratio will be the same as the ratio of the hypotenuses or any pair of corresponding sides.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the length of \( AB \), but since \( AB \) is already given as 4.4, the problem likely involves verifying or using the similarity ratio to confirm consistency.
- The key is to use the similarity of the triangles and the given measurements to ensure all relationships are consistent.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all geometric shapes, points, lines, and relationships.
- Include the given measurements and similarity constraints.
- Ensure all predicates are atomic and do not directly solve the problem.
