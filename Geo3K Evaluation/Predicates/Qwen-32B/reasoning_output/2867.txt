REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements**:
  - A circle with center \( B \).
  - Points \( A, C, D, F, G \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( A D \) and \( C G \) are diameters of the circle.
  - Angles are labeled at the center \( B \): \( \angle C B D = 55^\circ \) and \( \angle F B G = 35^\circ \).

- **Measurements and Labels**:
  - \( \angle C B D = 55^\circ \).
  - \( \angle F B G = 35^\circ \).
  - \( A D \) and \( C G \) are explicitly stated as diameters.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruence symbols are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of the Circle**:
  - Since \( A D \) and \( C G \) are diameters, they pass through the center \( B \) and divide the circle into semicircles.
  - The arc lengths and central angles are related to the circle's properties.

- **Central Angles**:
  - \( \angle C B D = 55^\circ \) subtends arc \( \widehat{C D} \).
  - \( \angle F B G = 35^\circ \) subtends arc \( \widehat{F G} \).

- **Arc Relationships**:
  - The total angle around the center \( B \) is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its corresponding central angle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \( \angle C B D = 55^\circ \).
  - \( \angle F B G = 35^\circ \).

- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \( A D \) and \( C G \) are diameters, the arcs \( \widehat{A D} \) and \( \widehat{C G} \) are semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
  - The remaining arcs can be calculated using the total circle angle of \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Objective**:
  - Find the measure of arc \( \widehat{A G} \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.
  - The total angle around the center is \( 360^\circ \).
  - The arc \( \widehat{A G} \) can be found by subtracting the measures of the known arcs and angles from \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates for Geometric Relationships**:
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify that \( A D \) and \( C G \) are diameters.
  - Define the central angles and their corresponding arcs.
  - Use the total circle angle to find the measure of \( \widehat{A G} \).

- **Predicates for Measurements**:
  - Assign the given angle measures to their respective central angles.
  - Use the properties of diameters and semicircles to establish arc measures.
