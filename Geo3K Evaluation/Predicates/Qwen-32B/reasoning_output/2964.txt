### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points and Lines**: 
  - Points: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, X, Z \)
  - Lines: 
    - \( AB \) (horizontal base)
    - \( AC \) (slanted line forming a 30° angle with \( AB \))
    - \( BC \) (slanted line forming a 45° angle with \( AB \))
    - \( AD \) (vertical line from \( A \) to \( D \))
    - \( BE \) (vertical line from \( B \) to \( E \))
    - \( DF \) (horizontal line from \( D \) to \( F \))
    - \( EG \) (horizontal line from \( E \) to \( G \))
    - \( FG \) (horizontal line segment connecting \( F \) and \( G \))
    - \( CZ \) (horizontal line from \( C \) to \( Z \))
    - \( XZ \) (horizontal line from \( X \) to \( Z \))
  
- **Shapes**:
  - Triangles: \( \triangle ADF \), \( \triangle BEG \), \( \triangle ABC \)
  - Rectangle: \( DFXZ \)
  
- **Measurements**:
  - \( AD = 8 \) (vertical length of \( \triangle ADF \))
  - \( AB = y + 6 \) (total horizontal length of the base)
  - \( DF = 6 \) (horizontal length of the rectangle \( DFXZ \))
  - \( BC = 45^\circ \) (angle at \( B \))
  - \( AC = 30^\circ \) (angle at \( A \))
  - \( Z \) is the horizontal distance we need to find.

- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles at \( \angle ADF \), \( \angle BEG \), \( \angle DFX \), and \( \angle EGZ \).
  - Parallel lines: \( DF \parallel EG \parallel XZ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ADF \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ADF = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle BEG \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BEG = 90^\circ \).
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is composed of two slanted lines meeting at \( C \).
  - The rectangle \( DFXZ \) has horizontal sides \( DF \) and \( XZ \), and vertical sides \( DX \) and \( FZ \).
  - \( DF \parallel XZ \) and \( DF = XZ = 6 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AD = 8 \): Vertical height of \( \triangle ADF \).
  - \( DF = 6 \): Horizontal width of the rectangle \( DFXZ \).
  - \( AB = y + 6 \): Total base length, split into \( y \) (left segment) and 6 (right segment).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( z \), which represents the horizontal distance from \( X \) to \( Z \) in the rectangle \( DFXZ \).
- Since \( DF = XZ = 6 \), the value of \( z \) is directly given as the length of \( DF \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships, including:
  - Right triangles and their properties.
  - The rectangle and its dimensions.
  - The given measurements and angles.
- The predicates will capture the structure of the figure without explicitly solving for \( z \).
