REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image depicts a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The vertices are labeled as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( AB \) is one side of the triangle, marked with a vertical red line indicating its length is \( x \).
  - \( BC \) is another side of the triangle, marked as 12 units.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle, marked as 25.5 units.
  
- **Angles:**
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( B \), indicating \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( B \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the legs of the triangle.
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  - The sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) are connected at vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Numerical Values:**
  - \( BC = 12 \) units (one leg of the right triangle).
  - \( AC = 25.5 \) units (hypotenuse of the right triangle).
  - \( AB = x \) units (the other leg of the right triangle, to be determined).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of side \( AB \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to right triangles: \( AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 \).
  - Given \( BC = 12 \) and \( AC = 25.5 \), we need to solve for \( AB = x \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the triangle, its vertices, sides, and right angle.
  - Include the measurements of the sides.
  - Capture the relationship that \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.
