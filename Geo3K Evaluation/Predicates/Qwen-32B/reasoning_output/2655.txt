================================================================================
QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The figure is a rectangle \(ABCD\).
  - Key points: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  
- **Lines and Angles**:
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the rectangle.
  - Diagonal \(AC\) is drawn inside the rectangle.
  - Right angles are marked at each vertex (\(\angle DAB\), \(\angle ABC\), \(\angle BCD\), \(\angle CDA\)).
  - Angle \(y^\circ\) is formed at vertex \(B\) between diagonal \(AC\) and side \(BC\).

- **Measurements**:
  - The diagonal \(AC\) is given as 13 units.
  - No other lengths are explicitly provided, but we know the properties of a rectangle (opposite sides are equal, all angles are right angles).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Rectangle Properties**:
  - Opposite sides are equal: \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\).
  - All angles are right angles: \(\angle DAB = \angle ABC = \angle BCD = \angle CDA = 90^\circ\).

- **Right Triangles**:
  - The diagonal \(AC\) divides the rectangle into two congruent right triangles: \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ADC\).
  - In \(\triangle ABC\), \(AB\) and \(BC\) are the legs, and \(AC\) is the hypotenuse.

- **Key Relationships**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to \(\triangle ABC\): \(AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2\).
  - The angle \(y^\circ\) is part of the right triangle \(\triangle ABC\), specifically \(\angle ACB\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - Diagonal \(AC = 13\) units.
  - No explicit lengths for \(AB\) or \(BC\) are given, but they can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem.

- **Unknowns**:
  - The lengths of \(AB\) and \(BC\) need to be determined.
  - The angle \(y^\circ\) needs to be calculated.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \(y\), which is the measure of \(\angle ACB\).
- To find \(y\), we need:
  1. Use the Pythagorean theorem to determine the lengths of \(AB\) and \(BC\).
  2. Use trigonometry (specifically the tangent function) to find the angle \(y\) based on the side lengths of \(\triangle ABC\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- Predicates will describe the rectangle, its sides, the diagonal, the right angles, and the relationships between the sides and angles.
