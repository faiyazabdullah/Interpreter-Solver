STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2971
================================================================================
QUESTION: Use parallelogram to find b.

REASONING:
================================================================================
#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure is a quadrilateral with vertices labeled \( X, Y, Z, W \).
  - The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram based on the context of the question.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - The sides of the quadrilateral are labeled with algebraic expressions:
    - \( XY = 3a + 7 \)
    - \( YZ = 2b \)
    - \( ZW = 4a \)
    - \( WX = b + 11 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - No specific markings (e.g., right angles, parallel lines) are explicitly shown, but the context suggests the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since the quadrilateral is identified as a parallelogram:
    - Opposite sides are equal: \( XY = ZW \) and \( WX = YZ \).
    - Opposite sides are parallel: \( XY \parallel ZW \) and \( WX \parallel YZ \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Extracted Measurements:**
  - \( XY = 3a + 7 \)
  - \( YZ = 2b \)
  - \( ZW = 4a \)
  - \( WX = b + 11 \)

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal:
    - \( XY = ZW \Rightarrow 3a + 7 = 4a \)
    - \( WX = YZ \Rightarrow b + 11 = 2b \)

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- **Task:**
  - Use the properties of the parallelogram to find the value of \( b \).
- **Relevant Properties:**
  - Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
  - The goal is to use the equation \( WX = YZ \) to solve for \( b \).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the quadrilateral as a parallelogram.
  - Represent the equality of opposite sides.
  - Capture the given measurements and their relationships.
