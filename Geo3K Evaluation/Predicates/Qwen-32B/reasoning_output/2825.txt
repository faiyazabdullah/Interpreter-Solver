REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a circle labeled as \( \odot P \).
  - Points \( J, K, L, M \) are marked on the circumference of the circle.
  - The center of the circle is labeled as \( P \).
  - Chords \( JK \), \( JL \), and \( KM \) are drawn within the circle.
  - The arc \( \widehat{JK} \) is explicitly shown, and its measure is not given directly.
  - The arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) is also shown, and its measure is given as 134 degrees.
  - The chord \( JK \) has a length of 10 units.

- **Visible Measurements and Labels**:
  - The length of chord \( JK \) is 10 units.
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) is 134 degrees.
  - The radius of the circle is not directly given but can be inferred if necessary.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No specific markings indicating perpendicularity, parallelism, or congruence are visible.
  - The central angle subtended by \( JK \) could be used to find additional information.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( J, K, L, M \) lie on the circumference of the circle, so they are points on the circle.
  - \( P \) is the center of the circle, so \( PJ, PK, PL, PM \) are radii of the circle.
  - The arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) is part of the circle, and its measure is 134 degrees.
  - The chord \( JK \) is a line segment joining two points on the circle, and its length is 10 units.
  - The arc \( \widehat{JL} \) is the portion of the circle from \( J \) to \( L \) that we need to find.

- **Implied Constraints**:
  - The measure of arc \( \widehat{JKL} \) is 134 degrees, which means the central angle \( \angle JPL \) subtended by \( \widehat{JKL} \) is also 134 degrees.
  - The arc \( \widehat{JL} \) is part of \( \widehat{JKL} \), and its measure depends on the position of point \( K \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Length of chord \( JK = 10 \) units.
  - Measure of arc \( \widehat{JKL} = 134 \) degrees.
  - No direct information about the radius or other specific angles is given, but these can be derived if necessary.

- **What These Measurements Represent**:
  - The length of \( JK \) helps in understanding the relative positions of \( J \) and \( K \) on the circle.
  - The measure of \( \widehat{JKL} \) gives the angular span from \( J \) to \( L \) via \( K \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The problem asks for the measure of arc \( \widehat{JL} \).
  - To find \( m\widehat{JL} \), we need to determine the angular span from \( J \) to \( L \) directly, excluding the portion involving \( K \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.
  - Since \( \widehat{JKL} \) is 134 degrees, and \( \widehat{JL} \) is part of it, we need to determine how much of this arc is excluded by point \( K \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the circle and its center.
  - Specify the points on the circle.
  - Indicate the lengths and measures of chords and arcs.
  - Capture the relationship between the arcs \( \widehat{JKL} \) and \( \widehat{JL} \).

- **Completeness Check**:
  - All visible information (chord length, arc measure) is included.
  - Relationships between points, lines, and arcs are represented.
  - No redundant or unnecessary predicates are included.
