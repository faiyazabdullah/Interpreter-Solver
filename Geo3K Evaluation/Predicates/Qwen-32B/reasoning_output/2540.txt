REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- **Points**: The diagram contains points \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G \).
- **Lines**: Lines connect these points, forming multiple segments such as \( AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FG, GB, AC, BF \).
- **Angles**: Several angles are marked:
  - \( \angle DAB = 36^\circ \)
  - \( \angle BAC = 24^\circ \)
  - \( \angle EFC = 40^\circ \)
  - \( \angle 3 \) is the angle we need to find.
- **Special Markings**: The problem states \( AB \perp BC \), indicating that \( AB \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular.
- **Other Observations**: 
  - Points \( D, E, F, G \) appear to form additional structures, but they do not directly affect the calculation of \( \angle 3 \).

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- **Perpendicular Relationship**: \( AB \perp BC \) implies \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- **Angle Relationships**:
  - \( \angle DAB = 36^\circ \) and \( \angle BAC = 24^\circ \) suggest that \( \angle DAC = \angle DAB + \angle BAC = 36^\circ + 24^\circ = 60^\circ \).
  - \( \angle 3 \) is part of the triangle \( ABG \), where \( \angle ABG = 90^\circ \) because \( AB \perp BC \).

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle DAB = 36^\circ \)
  - \( \angle BAC = 24^\circ \)
  - \( \angle EFC = 40^\circ \)
- **Derived Angles**:
  - \( \angle DAC = 60^\circ \) (sum of \( \angle DAB \) and \( \angle BAC \)).
  - Since \( AB \perp BC \), \( \angle ABG = 90^\circ \).

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 3 \).
- To find \( \angle 3 \), we need to use the fact that the sum of angles in triangle \( ABG \) is \( 180^\circ \).
- The key relationships are:
  - \( \angle ABG = 90^\circ \) (perpendicular relationship).
  - \( \angle BAG = \angle BAC = 24^\circ \) (since \( \angle BAG \) is part of \( \angle BAC \)).

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the given information and relationships using predicates.
- The predicates will capture:
  - The perpendicular relationship between \( AB \) and \( BC \).
  - The angle measurements and their relationships.
  - The structure of triangle \( ABG \).
