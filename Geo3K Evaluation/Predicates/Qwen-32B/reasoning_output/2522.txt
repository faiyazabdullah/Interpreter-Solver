REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains multiple points labeled \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \).
  - There are lines connecting these points, forming segments such as \( AB, BC, CD, DE, \) and \( AE \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( AB, BC, CD, DE, \) and \( AE \) are distinct line segments.
  - The lengths of some segments are given:
    - \( AE = 3 \)
    - \( AB = 2 \)
    - \( BC = 6 \)
    - \( ED = 2x - 3 \)

- **Special Markings:**
  - There are right angle symbols at points \( E \) and \( B \), indicating that \( \angle AEB \) and \( \angle ABC \) are right angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Right Angles:**
  - \( \angle AEB \) is a right angle, so \( AE \perp EB \).
  - \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle, so \( AB \perp BC \).

- **Line Segments:**
  - \( AB, BC, CD, \) and \( DE \) form a sequence of connected segments.
  - \( AE \) is a separate segment connecting \( A \) and \( E \).

- **Relationships:**
  - The diagram suggests a combination of right triangles and possibly a quadrilateral formed by \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) with additional segment \( DE \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AE = 3 \)
  - \( AB = 2 \)
  - \( BC = 6 \)
  - \( ED = 2x - 3 \)

- **Unknowns:**
  - The value of \( x \) needs to be determined based on the relationships in the diagram.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The problem asks to find the value of \( x \) given the relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The key is to use the given lengths and the geometric properties (right angles) to establish equations involving \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric shapes, right angles, and segment lengths using predicates.
- The relationships between the segments and the right angles will help us formulate the necessary equations.
