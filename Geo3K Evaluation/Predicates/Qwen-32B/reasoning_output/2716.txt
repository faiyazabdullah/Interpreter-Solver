REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - The vertices are labeled \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \( AB \) is a line segment with a length of 33 units.
  - \( BC \) is a line segment with a length of 66 units.
  - \( AC \) is a line segment with an unknown length labeled \( x \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - There is a right angle symbol at vertex \( A \), indicating that \( \angle BAC \) is a right angle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle because it contains a right angle at \( A \).
  - The sides \( AB \) and \( AC \) are the legs of the triangle, and \( BC \) is the hypotenuse.
  - The right angle at \( A \) implies that \( AB \) and \( AC \) are perpendicular.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - \( AB = 33 \) units.
  - \( BC = 66 \) units.
  - \( AC = x \) (unknown length to be determined).

- **Measurement Relationships**:
  - In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies: \( AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2 \).
  - Here, \( AB \) and \( AC \) are the legs, and \( BC \) is the hypotenuse.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **Question**:
  - The problem asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of \( AC \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The Pythagorean theorem is essential for solving this problem since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Define the triangle and its properties.
  - Specify the lengths of the known sides.
  - Indicate the right angle and the relationship between the sides.
  - Ensure all visible geometric relationships are represented.
