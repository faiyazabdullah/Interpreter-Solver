REASONING:
================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - There is a circle centered at point \( M \).
  - Points \( K \), \( L \), and \( A \) are labeled.
  - Line segment \( KL \) is tangent to the circle at point \( K \).
  - Point \( A \) lies on the circle.
  - Point \( M \) is the center of the circle.

- **Lines and Tangency:**
  - Line \( KL \) is tangent to the circle at \( K \).
  - Line segments \( KM \) and \( AM \) are radii of the circle.
  - Line segments \( KL \) and \( AL \) are shown with specific lengths.

- **Measurements:**
  - The length of \( AL \) is given as 10 units.
  - The length of \( KL \) is given as 17 units.
  - The variable \( x \) represents the length of the radius \( KM \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A right angle symbol is present at \( \angle MKL \), indicating that \( KL \) is tangent to the circle at \( K \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Tangency Property:**
  - Since \( KL \) is tangent to the circle at \( K \), \( MK \perp KL \). This implies \( \angle MKL = 90^\circ \).

- **Radii Properties:**
  - Both \( KM \) and \( AM \) are radii of the same circle, so \( KM = AM = x \).

- **Right Triangle:**
  - Triangle \( MKL \) is a right triangle with \( \angle MKL = 90^\circ \).
  - The hypotenuse of \( \triangle MKL \) is \( ML \).

- **Length Relationships:**
  - The total length \( ML \) can be split into two segments: \( MK + KL \).
  - The length \( AL \) is given as 10 units, and since \( A \) lies on the circle, \( AM = x \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( AL = 10 \) units.
  - \( KL = 17 \) units.
  - \( KM = AM = x \) (radius of the circle).

- **Derived Relationships:**
  - In \( \triangle MKL \), the Pythagorean theorem applies: \( ML^2 = MK^2 + KL^2 \).
  - Since \( ML = MA + AL = x + 10 \), we have \( ML = x + 10 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the radius of the circle.
- To find \( x \), we use the tangency property and the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle MKL \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all the geometric relationships and measurements in atomic predicates.
- The key relationships involve the tangency condition, the right triangle \( MKL \), and the radius properties.
