================================================================================
QUESTION: Find the side length in isosceles triangle D E F.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### **STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS**
- The image shows a triangle labeled \( \triangle DEF \).
- The vertices of the triangle are labeled \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \).
- The sides of the triangle are marked with lengths:
  - \( DE = 10x \) cm
  - \( DF = (8.5x + 3) \) cm
  - \( EF = (3.5x + 4) \) cm
- There are no additional markings indicating right angles, parallel lines, or specific angle measures.

#### **STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION**
- The triangle \( \triangle DEF \) is explicitly stated to be isosceles in the problem statement.
- In an isosceles triangle, two sides are equal in length. Therefore, one of the following conditions must hold:
  1. \( DE = DF \)
  2. \( DE = EF \)
  3. \( DF = EF \)
- The task is to determine the side lengths based on the given expressions and the isosceles property.

#### **STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS**
- The side lengths are given as algebraic expressions:
  - \( DE = 10x \)
  - \( DF = 8.5x + 3 \)
  - \( EF = 3.5x + 4 \)
- These expressions involve the variable \( x \), which needs to be determined to find the actual side lengths.

#### **STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS**
- The question asks for the side lengths of the isosceles triangle \( \triangle DEF \).
- To solve this, we need to use the isosceles property to set up equations and solve for \( x \). Once \( x \) is found, the side lengths can be calculated.

#### **STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING**
- We need to represent the triangle, its sides, and the isosceles property in predicates.
- The isosceles property will be represented by setting two side lengths equal to each other.
- The side lengths are given as algebraic expressions, so we will include these in the predicates.
