================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The image contains a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points labeled: \( A, B, C, D \).
  - Line segments: \( AB, BC, AC, AD, BD, CD \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \( BD = 6x \): This is the horizontal segment from \( B \) to \( D \).
  - \( AD = 36 \): This is the vertical segment from \( A \) to \( D \).
  - \( DC = x \): This is the horizontal segment from \( D \) to \( C \).

- **Angles**:
  - There are two right angles marked:
    - One at \( \angle ADB \).
    - Another at \( \angle ADC \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - \( D \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( A \) to \( BC \).
  - The segments \( BD \) and \( DC \) divide \( BC \) into two parts.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ADC \) are right triangles because they have right angles at \( D \).
  - \( AD \) is the common height for both smaller triangles.
  - \( BD + DC = BC \), so the total base \( BC \) is composed of \( 6x + x = 7x \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The right angles imply that \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( BC \).
  - The problem involves similar triangles or proportions due to the shared height and common angles.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( BD = 6x \).
  - \( AD = 36 \).
  - \( DC = x \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - The total base \( BC = BD + DC = 6x + x = 7x \).
  - The height \( AD \) is common to both smaller triangles \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ADC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The problem asks to find the value of \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The right triangles \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ADC \) share the same height \( AD \).
  - The similarity of these triangles or the use of area relationships can help solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the triangles, points, lines, and right angles.
  - Capture the measurements and relationships between segments.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are included.
