REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram shows a circle with center \( X \).
  - Points \( Z \), \( Y \), and \( X \) are labeled.
  - \( Z \) and \( Y \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( X \) is the center of the circle.

- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( XZ \) and \( XY \) are radii of the circle.
  - \( ZY \) is an arc of the circle.

- **Angles**:
  - The central angle \( \angle ZXY \) is marked as \( 75^\circ \).

- **Measurements**:
  - The radius of the circle is given as 6 inches.

- **Special Markings**:
  - No additional special markings such as right angles or parallel lines are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties**:
  - \( XZ \) and \( XY \) are radii of the circle, so they are equal in length.
  - The arc \( \widehat{ZY} \) is subtended by the central angle \( \angle ZXY \).

- **Central Angle and Arc Relationship**:
  - The length of the arc \( \widehat{ZY} \) depends on the central angle \( \angle ZXY \) and the radius of the circle.
  - The formula for the arc length is \( \text{Arc Length} = r \theta \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

- **Constraints**:
  - The radius \( r = 6 \) inches.
  - The central angle \( \theta = 75^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Radius \( r = 6 \) inches.
  - Central angle \( \theta = 75^\circ \).

- **Conversions**:
  - To use the arc length formula, the angle must be converted from degrees to radians.
  - Conversion formula: \( \theta_{\text{radians}} = \theta_{\text{degrees}} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \).
  - \( \theta_{\text{radians}} = 75 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{5\pi}{12} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of the arc \( \widehat{ZY} \).
- To find the arc length, we use the formula:
  \[
  \text{Arc Length} = r \theta
  \]
  where \( r = 6 \) inches and \( \theta = \frac{5\pi}{12} \) radians.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, its radius, the central angle, and the relationship between the arc and the central angle.
- Ensure all visible geometric relationships are captured in the predicates.
