STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2442
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram contains four points labeled \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
  - These points form a cross-like structure with vertical and horizontal lines passing through a central point \( E \).

- **Lines**:
  - Horizontal lines: One passes through points \( A \) and \( B \).
  - Vertical lines: One passes through points \( C \) and \( D \).

- **Angles**:
  - Four angles are labeled as \( x^\circ \) around the central point \( E \). These angles are formed by the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The central point \( E \) is the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines, indicating it is the origin of the angles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - The horizontal and vertical lines are perpendicular to each other, forming right angles.
  - The four angles around the central point \( E \) are adjacent angles and together form a full circle.

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - Since the horizontal and vertical lines are perpendicular, each pair of adjacent angles forms a right angle (90Â°).
  - The sum of the four angles around point \( E \) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values**:
  - Each of the four angles is labeled as \( x^\circ \).

- **What Measurements Represent**:
  - The angles \( x^\circ \) are the measures of the angles formed by the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks**:
  - The question asks for the value of \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - The sum of the four angles around a point is always \( 360^\circ \).
  - Since all four angles are equal (each labeled as \( x^\circ \)), they are congruent.

- **Information Needed**:
  - The fact that the sum of the four angles is \( 360^\circ \) and that they are equal allows us to set up an equation to solve for \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed**:
  - Represent the points, lines, and angles.
  - Capture the fact that the four angles are congruent and their total sum is \( 360^\circ \).
  - Ensure all visible relationships and constraints are included.
