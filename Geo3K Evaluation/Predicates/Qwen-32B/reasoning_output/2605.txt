REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is present.
  - Points labeled: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \).
  - Line segments: \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( DE \), \( EA \), and \( EB \).

- **Angles and Measurements:**
  - \( m\widehat{AC} = 160^\circ \): The measure of the arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is 160 degrees.
  - \( m\angle BEC = 38^\circ \): The measure of the angle \( \angle BEC \) is 38 degrees.

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, congruence, or parallel lines are present.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle Properties:**
  - \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - \( \widehat{AC} \) is an arc of the circle, and its measure is given as 160 degrees.
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are chords of the circle.
  
- **Angle Relationships:**
  - \( \angle BEC \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( \widehat{BC} \).
  - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Arc Measurement:**
  - \( m\widehat{AC} = 160^\circ \): This is the measure of the arc \( \widehat{AC} \).
  
- **Angle Measurement:**
  - \( m\angle BEC = 38^\circ \): This is the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle BEC \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is asked:**
  - The problem asks for the measure of \( \angle AEB \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - **Inscribed Angle Theorem:** An inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
  - **Central Angle-Arc Relationship:** The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it.
  - **Sum of Angles in a Circle:** The total measure of the circle is \( 360^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle and its properties.
  - Represent the points lying on the circle.
  - Represent the arc and its measure.
  - Represent the inscribed angles and their relationships.
  - Capture the given measurements and relationships.
