QUESTION: Find y.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a large triangle \( \triangle BCD \).
  - Within \( \triangle BCD \), there is a smaller triangle \( \triangle BAD \).
  - The point \( A \) lies on the side \( CD \) of \( \triangle BCD \).

- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - The side \( BC \) of \( \triangle BCD \) is labeled as 30 units.
  - The side \( CD \) of \( \triangle BCD \) is split into two segments by point \( A \):
    - \( CA = 28 \) units.
    - \( AD = 8 \) units.
  - The side \( BD \) of \( \triangle BCD \) is labeled as \( y \).

- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle at \( C \) in \( \triangle BCD \), indicated by the red right-angle symbol.
  - No other specific angles are explicitly marked.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle BCD \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).
  - \( \triangle BAD \) is a smaller triangle within \( \triangle BCD \).
  - The point \( A \) divides the side \( CD \) into two segments: \( CA = 28 \) and \( AD = 8 \).
  - The side \( BD \) is the hypotenuse of \( \triangle BAD \) and also part of \( \triangle BCD \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values**:
  - \( BC = 30 \) (hypotenuse of \( \triangle BCD \)).
  - \( CD = CA + AD = 28 + 8 = 36 \) (total length of side \( CD \)).
  - \( CA = 28 \) (one segment of \( CD \)).
  - \( AD = 8 \) (other segment of \( CD \)).
  - \( BD = y \) (unknown hypotenuse of \( \triangle BAD \)).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( y \), which is the length of side \( BD \) in \( \triangle BAD \).
- To find \( y \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BAD \):
  - \( BD^2 = BA^2 + AD^2 \).
- However, we do not know \( BA \) directly. Instead, we use the similarity of triangles \( \triangle BCD \) and \( \triangle BAD \) to find \( BA \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and measurements in the diagram.
- The key relationships involve the right triangles and the similarity between \( \triangle BCD \) and \( \triangle BAD \).
- We will use the Pythagorean theorem and similarity ratios to plan the predicates.
