================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  - \( C \) is the right-angle vertex, indicated by the red right-angle symbol.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - The sides of the triangle are labeled:
    - \( AB = 15 \) (hypotenuse).
    - \( AC = 9 \) (one leg).
    - \( BC = x \) (the other leg, which we need to find).

- **Special Markings:**
  - A red right-angle symbol is present at \( \angle ACB \), indicating that \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( C \).
  - The sides \( AC \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular to each other.
  - \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
  - The Pythagorean theorem applies to this triangle: \( AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( AB = 15 \) (hypotenuse).
  - \( AC = 9 \) (one leg).
  - \( BC = x \) (the other leg, to be determined).

- **Measurement Relationships:**
  - The lengths \( AB \), \( AC \), and \( BC \) are related by the Pythagorean theorem:
    \[
    AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    15^2 = 9^2 + x^2
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the value of \( x \), the length of side \( BC \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the Pythagorean theorem and the given measurements.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints in the diagram.
- Predicates should capture the shape, right angle, side lengths, and the relationship between them without directly stating the solution.
