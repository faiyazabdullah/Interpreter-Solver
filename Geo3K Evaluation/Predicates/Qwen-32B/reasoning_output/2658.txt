================================================================================
QUESTION: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Elements:**
  - A circle is present with center \( G \).
  - Points \( E, F, D \) lie outside the circle.
  - Segments \( EF \) and \( DF \) appear to be tangent to the circle at points \( F \) and \( D \), respectively.
  - Line \( ED \) is a secant intersecting the circle at points \( F \) and \( D \).

- **Visible Measurements:**
  - The length of segment \( EF \) is 12 units.
  - The length of segment \( ED \) is 16 units.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The tangency of segments \( EF \) and \( DF \) to the circle is implied by the problem statement ("Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent").

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( EF \) and \( DF \) are tangent segments from point \( E \) to the circle.
  - \( EF \) and \( DF \) are congruent because they are tangent segments drawn from the same external point to a circle.
  - \( ED \) is a secant segment, and its total length is given as 16 units.
  - The segment \( FD \) is part of the secant \( ED \), and its length can be expressed as \( ED - EF \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( EF = 12 \) units.
  - \( ED = 16 \) units.
  - Since \( EF \) and \( DF \) are tangent segments, \( DF = EF = 12 \) units.

- **Relationship Between Measurements:**
  - The length of the secant segment \( FD \) can be calculated as:
    \[
    FD = ED - EF = 16 - 12 = 4 \text{ units}.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks for the value of \( x \), which represents the length of segment \( FD \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The tangent-secant theorem is not directly applicable here since we are dealing with tangent-tangent and secant-tangent relationships.
  - Instead, the key property used is that tangent segments drawn from the same external point to a circle are congruent.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the points, lines, and tangency relationships.
  - Capture the lengths of the segments.
  - Ensure all relationships are atomic and consistent with the image.
