REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two circles are present: 
    - Circle \( J \) with center \( J \).
    - Circle \( K \) with center \( K \).
  - Points labeled: \( A, B, C, D, J, K \).
  - Line segments: 
    - \( AB \) is part of the larger circle.
    - \( BC \) connects the two circles.
    - \( CD \) is part of the smaller circle.
  
- **Visible Measurements:**
  - Circle \( J \) has a radius of 10 units.
  - Circle \( K \) has a radius of 8 units.
  - Line segment \( BC = 5.4 \) units.

- **Special Markings:**
  - \( B \) and \( C \) are points of intersection between the two circles.
  - No other special markings like right angles or parallel lines are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Both circles intersect at points \( B \) and \( C \).
  - \( J \) is the center of the larger circle, and \( K \) is the center of the smaller circle.
  - \( BC \) is a common chord of both circles.
  - \( BK \) and \( CK \) are radii of circle \( K \).
  - \( BJ \) and \( CJ \) are radii of circle \( J \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - Since \( J \) and \( K \) are centers, \( BJ = 10 \) and \( CK = 8 \).
  - \( BC = 5.4 \) is given.
  - The problem involves finding \( CK \), which is already known as the radius of circle \( K \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Radius of circle \( J \): 10 units.
  - Radius of circle \( K \): 8 units.
  - Length of \( BC \): 5.4 units.

- **Measurement Relationships:**
  - \( BJ = 10 \) (radius of circle \( J \)).
  - \( CK = 8 \) (radius of circle \( K \)).
  - \( BC = 5.4 \) is the length of the common chord.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks for the length of \( CK \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - \( CK \) is a radius of circle \( K \), so its length is directly given as 8 units.
  
- **Information Needed:**
  - The radius of circle \( K \) is already provided as 8 units.
  - No further calculations are needed since \( CK \) is explicitly the radius of circle \( K \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the circles and their radii.
  - Specify the points of intersection.
  - Indicate the lengths of radii and the common chord.
  
- **Ensuring Completeness:**
  - All visible relationships and measurements are captured.
  - Predicates will not include the final answer but will provide enough information for another system to deduce it.
