REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - There is a large circle with center \( I \).
  - Several points are labeled: \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J \).
  - Lines connect these points, forming various segments and triangles.
  - Angles are marked at specific points.

- **Visible Measurements and Annotations**:
  - \( \angle EFC = 95^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AFI = 15^\circ \).

- **Special Markings**:
  - Red right-angle symbols indicate right angles at points \( J \), \( H \), and \( G \).
  - The circle appears to have tangents or secants passing through it.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Circle and Tangents/Secants**:
  - The circle has multiple lines intersecting it, suggesting tangents or secants.
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) lie outside the circle, connected to points on the circle via lines.

- **Angles and Relationships**:
  - \( \angle EFC = 95^\circ \) is an external angle formed by the intersection of lines.
  - \( \angle AFI = 15^\circ \) suggests a relationship involving the circle's center \( I \) and tangent properties.
  - Right angles at \( J, H, \) and \( G \) indicate perpendicularity.

- **Triangles and Quadrilaterals**:
  - Triangles and quadrilaterals are formed by connecting the points. For example:
    - \( \triangle AFI \) with \( \angle AFI = 15^\circ \).
    - \( \triangle BFG \) with right angles at \( G \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**:
  - \( \angle EFC = 95^\circ \).
  - \( \angle AFI = 15^\circ \).

- **Inferred Relationships**:
  - The right angles suggest perpendicular relationships, e.g., \( Line(J, I) \perp Line(A, J) \).
  - The circle's center \( I \) plays a key role in determining angles and tangents.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle B \) given \( m\angle A = 10^\circ \).
- To solve this, we need to analyze the relationships between the angles formed by the lines and the circle.
- Key considerations:
  - Use the properties of circles, such as the fact that the angle subtended by a chord at the center is twice the angle subtended at the circumference.
  - Analyze the tangents and secants to determine how they affect the angles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all visible geometric elements and relationships.
- Use predicates to capture the circle, lines, angles, and perpendicular relationships.
- Ensure all given measurements and constraints are included.
