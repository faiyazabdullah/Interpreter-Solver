REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - There is a point \( D \) on side \( AC \), dividing it into two segments.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - \( AD = 6x + 2 \)
  - \( DC = 8 \)
  - \( AB = 9x - 2 \)
  - \( BC = 10 \)
  
- **Angles and Markings:**
  - There is a pink arc marking an angle at \( \angle DBC \), suggesting it might be significant or related to the problem.
  - No explicit right angles or parallel lines are marked.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Relationships Between Elements:**
  - Point \( D \) lies on line segment \( AC \), dividing it into two parts: \( AD \) and \( DC \).
  - The total length of \( AC \) is the sum of \( AD \) and \( DC \): \( AC = AD + DC \).
  - The sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( AC \) form the sides of \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The lengths \( AD \) and \( DC \) are expressed in terms of \( x \).
  - The problem likely involves solving for \( x \) using the relationships between the sides of the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( AD = 6x + 2 \)
  - \( DC = 8 \)
  - \( AB = 9x - 2 \)
  - \( BC = 10 \)

- **What These Measurements Represent:**
  - \( AD \) and \( DC \) are segments of the side \( AC \).
  - \( AB \) and \( BC \) are the other two sides of \( \triangle ABC \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The total length of \( AC \) is \( AC = AD + DC = (6x + 2) + 8 = 6x + 10 \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The question asks to find the value of \( x \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The problem likely involves using the properties of triangles, such as the triangle inequality theorem or specific relationships between the sides.

- **Information Needed:**
  - We need to use the given side lengths and the relationship \( AC = AD + DC \) to form an equation involving \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent Relationships:**
  - Define the triangle and its sides.
  - Express the division of \( AC \) into \( AD \) and \( DC \).
  - Use the given measurements to form equations.

- **Completeness Check:**
  - All visible measurements and relationships are captured.
  - The predicates will allow another system to solve for \( x \) using the given information.
