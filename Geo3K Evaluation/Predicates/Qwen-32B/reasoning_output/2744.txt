STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2744
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find m \angle A B C if m \angle C D A = 61.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The image contains a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with vertices labeled \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - There are two triangles within the quadrilateral: \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\).

- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Lines \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  - Angles are marked at specific vertices:
    - \(\angle CAB = 69^\circ\)
    - \(\angle ABC = 55^\circ\)
    - \(\angle CDA = 61^\circ\)

- **Special Markings:**
  - No additional markings such as right angles, parallel lines, or congruence symbols are visible.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Triangles:**
  - \(\triangle ABC\) is formed by vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\).
  - \(\triangle ACD\) is formed by vertices \(A\), \(C\), and \(D\).

- **Quadrilateral:**
  - Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is composed of the four vertices and sides \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), and \(DA\).

- **Angle Relationships:**
  - The sum of the interior angles in \(\triangle ABC\) is \(180^\circ\).
  - The sum of the interior angles in \(\triangle ACD\) is also \(180^\circ\).
  - The quadrilateral's interior angles sum to \(360^\circ\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \(\angle CAB = 69^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ABC = 55^\circ\)
  - \(\angle CDA = 61^\circ\)

- **Derived Measurements:**
  - To find \(\angle BCA\) in \(\triangle ABC\), we use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\):
    \[
    \angle BCA = 180^\circ - \angle CAB - \angle ABC = 180^\circ - 69^\circ - 55^\circ = 56^\circ
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle ABC\), which is already given as \(55^\circ\). However, to ensure consistency and completeness, we need to confirm this using the relationships in the diagram.
- The problem involves analyzing the angles in \(\triangle ABC\) and ensuring all relationships are consistent.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the given angles, the triangles, and the quadrilateral.
- Predicates should capture the relationships between the angles and the geometric shapes without directly stating the final answer.
