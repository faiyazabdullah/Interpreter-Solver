REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes**: 
  - The figure shows a quadrilateral labeled \(ABCD\).
  - Based on the problem statement, it is explicitly mentioned that \(ABCD\) is a rhombus.
  
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points: \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
  - Lines: \(\overline{AB}\), \(\overline{BC}\), \(\overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{DA}\).

- **Markings**:
  - The quadrilateral is drawn with equal-length sides, consistent with the property of a rhombus.
  - No additional markings such as right angles or diagonals are explicitly shown.

- **Measurements**:
  - The lengths of sides are given as:
    - \(AB = 2x + 3\)
    - \(BC = x + 7\)

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Properties of a Rhombus**:
  - All four sides of a rhombus are congruent.
  - Opposite sides are parallel.
  - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

- **Constraints from the Problem**:
  - Since \(ABCD\) is a rhombus, we have:
    \[
    AB = BC = CD = DA
    \]
  - Therefore, \(AB = BC\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 2x + 3\)
  - \(BC = x + 7\)

- **Relationship Between Measurements**:
  - Since \(AB = BC\) (as all sides of a rhombus are equal), we can set up the equation:
    \[
    2x + 3 = x + 7
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked**:
  - The question asks us to find the length of side \(CD\).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties**:
  - In a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, \(CD = AB = BC = DA\).

- **Steps to Solve**:
  1. Solve the equation \(2x + 3 = x + 7\) to find the value of \(x\).
  2. Substitute the value of \(x\) back into the expression for \(AB\) (or any side) to find the length of \(CD\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates to Represent the Diagram**:
  - Define the rhombus and its properties.
  - Represent the equality of side lengths.
  - Capture the given expressions for the side lengths.
