### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: The diagram contains points labeled \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \).
- **Lines**: Multiple lines intersect at point \( A \):
  - Line segments \( AB, AC, AD, AE, AF, AG, AH \).
- **Angles**: Several angles are labeled:
  - \( \angle 1, \angle 2, \angle 3, \angle 4, \angle 5, \angle 6, \angle 7, \angle 8 \).
- **Special Markings**:
  - Angles \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are marked as congruent (indicated by double tick marks).
  - Angles \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are also marked as congruent.
  - Angles \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are vertical angles.
  - Angles \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are vertical angles.
- **Measurements**: The measure of \( \angle 4 \) is given as \( 101^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Vertical Angles**: 
  - \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are vertical angles, so they are congruent (\( \angle 4 = \angle 5 \)).
  - \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 8 \) are vertical angles, so they are congruent (\( \angle 6 = \angle 8 \)).
- **Congruent Angles**: 
  - \( \angle 2 \) and \( \angle 3 \) are marked as congruent.
  - \( \angle 6 \) and \( \angle 7 \) are marked as congruent.
- **Linear Pair**: 
  - Angles \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 6 \) form a linear pair because they are adjacent and lie on a straight line. Therefore, their measures sum to \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The given measurement is \( \text{m} \angle 4 = 101^\circ \).
- Using the properties of vertical angles and linear pairs, we can deduce the measures of other angles.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \( \angle 6 \).
- Since \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 6 \) form a linear pair, we use the property that the sum of angles in a linear pair is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  \text{m} \angle 4 + \text{m} \angle 6 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substituting \( \text{m} \angle 4 = 101^\circ \):
  \[
  101^\circ + \text{m} \angle 6 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Solving for \( \text{m} \angle 6 \):
  \[
  \text{m} \angle 6 = 180^\circ - 101^\circ = 79^\circ
  \]

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the geometric relationships and constraints visible in the diagram.
- The predicates should capture:
  - The points, lines, and angles.
  - The vertical angle relationships.
  - The linear pair relationship between \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 6 \).
  - The given measurement \( \text{m} \angle 4 = 101^\circ \).
