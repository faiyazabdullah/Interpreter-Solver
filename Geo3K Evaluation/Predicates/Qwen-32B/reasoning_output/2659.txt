STEP-BY-STEP REASONING FOR PROBLEM 2659
================================================================================
QUESTION: Find \widehat W N if \triangle I W N is equilateral and W N = 5.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram contains a circle.
  - Three points \( I \), \( W \), and \( N \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - The triangle \( \triangle IWN \) is formed by connecting these three points.
  
- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - The sides \( IW \), \( WN \), and \( NI \) form the triangle \( \triangle IWN \).
  - The segment \( WN \) is explicitly marked as having a length of 5 units.
  
- **Special Markings and Properties:**
  - The problem states that \( \triangle IWN \) is equilateral.
  - Since it is equilateral, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( I \), \( W \), and \( N \) are points on the circumference of the circle, so they lie on the same circle.
  - \( \triangle IWN \) is equilateral, implying:
    - \( IW = WN = NI \).
    - All internal angles of \( \triangle IWN \) are \( 60^\circ \).

- **Implied Constraints:**
  - Since \( \triangle IWN \) is inscribed in the circle, the circle is the circumcircle of the triangle.
  - The arc \( \widehat{WN} \) subtends the central angle corresponding to the side \( WN \) of the triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements:**
  - \( WN = 5 \) units.
  
- **Derived Measurements:**
  - Since \( \triangle IWN \) is equilateral, \( IW = WN = NI = 5 \) units.
  - Each internal angle of \( \triangle IWN \) is \( 60^\circ \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The question asks for the measure of the arc \( \widehat{WN} \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - In a circle, the measure of an arc is determined by the central angle that subtends it.
  - For an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, each side subtends a central angle of \( 120^\circ \) (since the full circle is \( 360^\circ \) and there are three equal arcs).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the circle, its points, and the triangle.
  - Capture the equilateral property of \( \triangle IWN \).
  - Indicate the lengths of the sides and the measure of the arc \( \widehat{WN} \).
