QUESTION: Find X W.

REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**:
  - The diagram consists of a large triangle \( \triangle BWY \).
  - Inside \( \triangle BWY \), there is a smaller triangle \( \triangle BXZ \).
  - There is a rectangle \( WXYZ \) formed by the intersection of lines and the triangles.
  
- **Lines and Segments**:
  - \( BW \) is a segment of the larger triangle.
  - \( BY \) is a segment of the larger triangle.
  - \( BX \) and \( BZ \) are segments connecting point \( B \) to points \( X \) and \( Z \) respectively.
  - \( WZ \) and \( ZY \) are sides of the rectangle.
  
- **Angles**:
  - There is a right angle at \( \angle BZX \) indicated by the square symbol.
  - \( \angle BXZ \) appears to be part of the larger triangle.

- **Measurements**:
  - The length of \( BY \) is given as 12 units.
  - \( WZ \) and \( ZY \) are horizontal segments forming the rectangle.

- **Special Markings**:
  - The rectangle \( WXYZ \) suggests that \( WZ \parallel XY \) and \( WX \parallel ZY \).
  - The right angle at \( \angle BZX \) indicates that \( BX \) is an altitude of \( \triangle BWY \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships**:
  - \( \triangle BXZ \) is a right triangle because \( \angle BZX \) is a right angle.
  - \( \triangle BXZ \) is similar to \( \triangle BWY \) by AA similarity (both have \( \angle WBZ \) and right angles).
  - \( WZ \) and \( ZY \) are equal in length because they are opposite sides of the rectangle.
  - \( BX \) is an altitude of \( \triangle BWY \).

- **Constraints and Properties**:
  - The right angle at \( \angle BZX \) implies that \( BX \) is perpendicular to \( WZ \).
  - The rectangle \( WXYZ \) ensures that \( WZ \parallel XY \) and \( WX \parallel ZY \).
  - Since \( \triangle BXZ \) is similar to \( \triangle BWY \), corresponding sides are proportional.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Measurements**:
  - \( BY = 12 \) units.
  - The length of \( BX \) is what we need to find.
  
- **Relationships Between Measurements**:
  - Since \( \triangle BXZ \sim \triangle BWY \), the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
    \[
    \frac{BX}{BW} = \frac{BZ}{BY} = \frac{XZ}{WY}
    \]
  - The rectangle \( WXYZ \) implies \( WZ = ZY \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the length of \( BX \).
- To find \( BX \), we use the similarity of triangles \( \triangle BXZ \) and \( \triangle BWY \).
- We need to determine the proportionality constant between the sides of the two triangles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all visible geometric shapes, lines, angles, and relationships.
- Use similarity properties and the given measurement \( BY = 12 \) to plan the predicates.
- Ensure all atomic relationships are captured without solving for the final answer.
