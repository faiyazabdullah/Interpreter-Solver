REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - Two triangles are shown.
  - Both triangles have vertices labeled.
  - The left triangle has vertices \( A \), \( B \), and another unlabeled vertex.
  - The right triangle has vertices labeled \( A' \), \( B' \), and another unlabeled vertex.

- **Lines and Measurements:**
  - The sides of the triangles are labeled with lengths:
    - Left triangle:
      - One side is 12 units.
      - Another side is 20 units.
      - The third side is labeled \( 2x \).
    - Right triangle:
      - One side is 12 units.
      - Another side is 15 units.
      - The third side is labeled \( y + 4 \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Corresponding sides of the two triangles are marked with tick marks, indicating they are proportional.
  - The triangles are similar (as indicated by the problem statement).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similar Triangles:**
  - The two triangles are similar, meaning their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional.
  - The similarity implies:
    \[
    \frac{\text{Side}_1 \text{ of left triangle}}{\text{Side}_1 \text{ of right triangle}} = \frac{\text{Side}_2 \text{ of left triangle}}{\text{Side}_2 \text{ of right triangle}} = \frac{\text{Side}_3 \text{ of left triangle}}{\text{Side}_3 \text{ of right triangle}}
    \]

- **Proportional Sides:**
  - The sides marked with tick marks indicate the correspondence:
    - \( 12 \) (left) corresponds to \( 12 \) (right).
    - \( 20 \) (left) corresponds to \( 15 \) (right).
    - \( 2x \) (left) corresponds to \( y + 4 \) (right).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - Left triangle:
    - One side: 12 units.
    - Another side: 20 units.
    - Third side: \( 2x \).
  - Right triangle:
    - One side: 12 units.
    - Another side: 15 units.
    - Third side: \( y + 4 \).

- **Relationships:**
  - The proportionality of corresponding sides can be written as:
    \[
    \frac{12}{12} = \frac{20}{15} = \frac{2x}{y + 4}
    \]
  - Simplifying the first ratio:
    \[
    \frac{12}{12} = 1
    \]
  - Simplifying the second ratio:
    \[
    \frac{20}{15} = \frac{4}{3}
    \]
  - Therefore, the scale factor between the triangles is \( \frac{4}{3} \).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks to find the value of \( x \).
- To solve for \( x \), we use the proportionality of the corresponding sides:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{y + 4} = \frac{4}{3}
  \]
- However, since \( y \) is not directly given, we need to use the other proportional sides to find \( x \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles and their properties.
- Capture the proportional relationships between corresponding sides.
- Ensure all visible constraints and relationships are included.
