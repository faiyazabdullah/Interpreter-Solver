REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING:

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Points**: A, B, C, D, E, F
- **Lines**: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, BD
- **Angles**: 
  - ∠1 at point A (angle between lines AF and AB)
  - ∠2 at point B (angle between lines BF and BC)
  - ∠3 at point D (angle between lines BD and DE)
  - ∠4 at point C (angle between lines BC and CD)
  - ∠5 at point E (angle between lines DE and EF)
  - ∠6 at point F (angle between lines EF and FA)
- **Measurements**:
  - ∠ABD = 48° (labeled)
  - ∠CDE = 39° (labeled)
- **Special Markings**:
  - Right angles at ∠AFB, ∠BFC, ∠CDE, and ∠DEF.
  - Lines AB, BC, CD, and DE appear to form a series of connected segments.
  - Points F and B lie on the same horizontal line.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Right Angles**:
  - ∠AFB, ∠BFC, ∠CDE, and ∠DEF are all right angles.
- **Parallel Lines**:
  - Lines AB and DE appear parallel because they are both perpendicular to the same horizontal line through F and B.
- **Geometric Shapes**:
  - Quadrilateral BCFE appears to be a rectangle due to its right angles and parallel sides.
  - Triangles AFB and BFC are right triangles.
  - Triangle CDE is also a right triangle.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Angles**:
  - ∠ABD = 48°
  - ∠CDE = 39°
- **Derived Angles**:
  - Since ∠AFB is a right angle (90°), we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180° to find other angles.
  - Similarly, since ∠CDE is a right angle, we can use the same principle for triangle CDE.

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of ∠2, which is the angle at point B between lines BF and BC.
- From the image, ∠2 is part of the right triangle BFC, and we know that ∠BFC is a right angle (90°).
- We need to determine the measure of ∠2 using the given information about ∠ABD and the properties of right triangles.

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all geometric shapes, points, lines, and angles.
- Capture the relationships between the angles, such as the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
- Use the given measurements (∠ABD = 48° and ∠CDE = 39°) to derive other angles.
