================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The figure shows a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
  - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are the vertices of the triangle.
  
- **Lines and Angles:**
  - Line segments \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) form the sides of the triangle.
  - There is a right angle at vertex \( A \) (denoted by the red right-angle symbol).
  - Angles \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle BCA \) are labeled as \( x^\circ \) and \( 2x^\circ \), respectively.

- **Special Markings:**
  - The right-angle symbol at \( A \) indicates \( \angle CAB = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \( A \).
  - The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The angles \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \), \( \angle ABC = x^\circ \), and \( \angle BCA = 2x^\circ \) are related by the triangle angle sum property.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Numerical Values and Labels:**
  - \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \) (right angle).
  - \( \angle ABC = x^\circ \).
  - \( \angle BCA = 2x^\circ \).

- **Relationships Between Measurements:**
  - The sum of the angles in \( \triangle ABC \) is:
    \[
    \angle BAC + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ.
    \]
  - Substituting the known values:
    \[
    90^\circ + x^\circ + 2x^\circ = 180^\circ.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What is Asked:**
  - The problem asks us to find the value of \( x \).
  
- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \).
  - The right angle at \( A \) fixes one angle at \( 90^\circ \).
  - The other two angles are \( x^\circ \) and \( 2x^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Define the triangle and its vertices.
  - Indicate the right angle at \( A \).
  - Specify the angle measures using the given variables \( x \) and \( 2x \).
  - Use the triangle angle sum property to establish the relationship between the angles.
