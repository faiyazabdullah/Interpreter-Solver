REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points**: 
  - The diagram contains two polygons: quadrilateral \(ABCD\) and quadrilateral \(AEFG\).
  - Both polygons appear to be rectangles based on their shape and orientation.
  
- **Lines and Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 26\)
  - \(AD = 12\)
  - \(DG = 4.5\)
  - \(GF = 14\)
  - \(EF = 8\)
  - \(BE = 26 - EF = 26 - 8 = 18\) (since \(E\) is on \(AB\) and \(F\) is on \(BC\)).
  
- **Angles**:
  - \(\angle AGF = 108^\circ\)
  
- **Special Markings**:
  - The quadrilaterals \(ABCD\) and \(AEFG\) are marked as similar (\(ABCD \sim AEFG\)).
  - All right angles are implied at the corners of the rectangles.

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Similarity**:
  - Since \(ABCD \sim AEFG\), the corresponding sides are proportional, and corresponding angles are equal.
  
- **Rectangles**:
  - Both \(ABCD\) and \(AEFG\) are rectangles, so all internal angles are \(90^\circ\).
  
- **Proportional Sides**:
  - The similarity ratio between \(ABCD\) and \(AEFG\) can be determined from the given side lengths.

- **Angle Relationships**:
  - \(\angle AGF = 108^\circ\) is an external angle formed by extending \(AG\) and \(GF\).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Given Measurements**:
  - \(AB = 26\)
  - \(AD = 12\)
  - \(DG = 4.5\)
  - \(GF = 14\)
  - \(EF = 8\)
  - \(\angle AGF = 108^\circ\)
  
- **Derived Measurements**:
  - Since \(ABCD \sim AEFG\), the similarity ratio can be calculated using the given side lengths.
  - The similarity ratio is \(\frac{AB}{AE} = \frac{26}{18}\).

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for the measure of \(\angle ADC\).
- Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle, all internal angles are \(90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ\).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships, measurements, and constraints.
- The key relationships are the similarity of the polygons, the rectangle properties, and the given angle measurements.
