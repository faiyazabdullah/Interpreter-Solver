REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - A circle is centered at point \( O \).
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
  - Lines \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters of the circle.
  - \( O \) is the center of the circle.

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, so they pass through the center \( O \).
  - \( BO \), \( OD \), \( DE \), \( EF \), \( FO \), \( OA \), \( AC \), etc., are radii of the circle.

- **Angles:**
  - Angles \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are marked as congruent.
  - These angles are central angles subtended by arcs on the circle.

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbol at \( \angle EOF \), indicating \( \angle EOF = 90^\circ \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Diameters:**
  - \( EC \) and \( AB \) are diameters, meaning they pass through the center \( O \) and have lengths equal to twice the radius.
  
- **Radii:**
  - \( BO \), \( OD \), \( DE \), \( EF \), \( FO \), \( OA \), etc., are radii of the circle, so they are congruent in length.

- **Central Angles:**
  - Central angles \( \angle BOD \), \( \angle DOE \), \( \angle EOF \), and \( \angle FOA \) are congruent.
  - Since \( \angle EOF = 90^\circ \), each of these central angles is also \( 90^\circ \).

- **Arcs:**
  - Arcs subtended by these central angles are congruent because the central angles are congruent.
  - The arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is composed of two such arcs: \( \widehat{AF} \) and \( \widehat{FC} \).

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Central Angles:**
  - Given \( \angle EOF = 90^\circ \), and since \( \angle BOD \cong \angle DOE \cong \angle EOF \cong \angle FOA \), each central angle is \( 90^\circ \).

- **Arcs:**
  - Each central angle subtends an arc of \( 90^\circ \). Therefore, the total measure of arc \( \widehat{AC} \) is the sum of the measures of the arcs subtended by \( \angle FOA \) and \( \angle EOF \):
    \[
    m\widehat{AC} = m\widehat{FOA} + m\widehat{EOF} = 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ.
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- The question asks for \( m\widehat{AC} \), the measure of the arc \( \widehat{AC} \).
- From the analysis, we know that \( \widehat{AC} \) is composed of two \( 90^\circ \) arcs, so its total measure is \( 180^\circ \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all visible geometric relationships and constraints using the provided predicate format.
- Predicates should capture the following:
  - The circle and its center.
  - The diameters and radii.
  - The congruence of central angles.
  - The measure of specific angles and arcs.
