REASONING:
================================================================================
### STEP-BY-STEP REASONING

#### STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- **Geometric Shapes and Points:**
  - The diagram shows a quadrilateral labeled \( EFGH \).
  - Diagonals \( EG \) and \( FH \) intersect at point \( K \).

- **Lines and Segments:**
  - Lines \( EF \), \( FG \), \( GH \), and \( HE \) form the sides of the quadrilateral.
  - Diagonals \( EG \) and \( FH \) are drawn and intersect at point \( K \).

- **Special Markings:**
  - Right angle symbols are present at vertices \( E \), \( F \), \( G \), and \( H \), indicating that all interior angles of the quadrilateral are right angles.
  - Measurements are given for two sides:
    - \( EF = 4x - 6 \)
    - \( HG = x + 3 \)

- **Other Observations:**
  - The quadrilateral is explicitly stated to be a rectangle.
  - The diagonals \( EG \) and \( FH \) appear to bisect each other at point \( K \).

#### STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- **Geometric Relationships:**
  - Since \( EFGH \) is a rectangle:
    - Opposite sides are equal: \( EF = HG \) and \( EH = FG \).
    - All interior angles are right angles.
    - Diagonals are equal in length: \( EG = FH \).
    - Diagonals bisect each other.

- **Constraints and Properties:**
  - The given measurements \( EF = 4x - 6 \) and \( HG = x + 3 \) imply that these two expressions are equal because opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent.

#### STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- **Extracted Numerical Values:**
  - \( EF = 4x - 6 \)
  - \( HG = x + 3 \)

- **Relationships:**
  - Since \( EFGH \) is a rectangle, \( EF = HG \). Therefore, we have the equation:
    \[
    4x - 6 = x + 3
    \]

#### STEP 4: QUESTION ANALYSIS
- **What the Question Asks:**
  - The problem asks us to find the length of \( EF \).

- **Relevant Geometric Properties:**
  - The fact that \( EFGH \) is a rectangle implies that \( EF = HG \).
  - We need to solve the equation \( 4x - 6 = x + 3 \) to find the value of \( x \), and then substitute it back to determine \( EF \).

#### STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- **Predicates Needed:**
  - Represent the rectangle and its properties.
  - Capture the equality of opposite sides.
  - Include the given measurements and their relationships.
  - Ensure all visible geometric constraints are represented.
