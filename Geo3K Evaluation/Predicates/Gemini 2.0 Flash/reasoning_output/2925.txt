PROBLEM 2925 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side AB is marked as 12 ft.
- Side AD is marked as 10 ft.
- There are right angle symbols at vertices A, B, C, and D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.
- Opposite sides of rectangle ABCD are parallel.
- Sides AB and CD are parallel.
- Sides AD and BC are parallel.
- All angles in rectangle ABCD are right angles.
- Sides AB and CD are congruent.
- Sides AD and BC are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12 ft (given)
- AD = 10 ft (given)
- The question asks to find the area of the rectangle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the rectangle ABCD.
- Area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length and width.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Area of a rectangle is length * width.
