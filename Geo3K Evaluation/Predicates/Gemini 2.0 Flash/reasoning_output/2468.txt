PROBLEM 2468 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle EFG, with an altitude EH drawn to the hypotenuse GF.
- There is a right angle at vertex E.
- There is a right angle at vertex H.
- The length of HF is 12.
- The length of GF is 16.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle EFG is a right triangle, with angle GEF being a right angle.
- EH is perpendicular to GF, therefore EH is an altitude of triangle EFG.
- GH + HF = GF

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- HF = 12
- GF = 16
- GH = GF - HF = 16 - 12 = 4

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of the altitude EH.
- The altitude EH divides the right triangle EFG into two smaller similar right triangles, GEH and EHF.
- Therefore, triangle GEH is similar to triangle EHF, which is similar to triangle EFG.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, triangles, and right angles.
- Represent the lengths of HF and GF.
- Represent that EH is an altitude to GF.
- Express that GH + HF = GF.
- Establish similarity between triangles GEH and EHF
