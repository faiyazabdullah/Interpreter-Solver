PROBLEM 2703 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with a point D on side BC.
- The lengths of sides AC and AB are given as 10 and 14, respectively.
- The length of side BC is given as 18.
- The length of side DB is labeled as x.
- There is an angle marked at A.
- Angle CAD is equal to angle BAD

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point D lies on line BC.
- AD bisects angle BAC.
- Length of BC is the sum of CD and DB.
- Angle bisector theorem applies to this triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 10
- AB = 14
- BC = 18
- DB = x
- CD = 18 - x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of x.
- The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the sides of the triangle equals the ratio of the segments created by the angle bisector on the opposite side.
- Therefore, AC/AB = CD/DB, i.e. 10/14 = (18-x)/x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, and triangle.
- Define the lengths of the lines.
- Define that AD bisects angle BAC.
- Define the relationship between CD, DB, and BC.
