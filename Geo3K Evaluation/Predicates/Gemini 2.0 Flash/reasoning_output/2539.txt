PROBLEM 2539 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find m \widehat P J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center M.
- There are points F, K, G, H, P, and J on the circle.
- Line segment FG intersects line segment KL at point L.
- Line segment HJ intersects line segment KP at point N.
- There is a right angle symbol at L and N.
- There are labels F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- FG and HJ are chords of the circle.
- KL and KP are chords of the circle.
- ML is perpendicular to FG, and MN is perpendicular to HJ.
- Since ML is perpendicular to FG, it bisects FG. Similarly, MN is perpendicular to HJ, so it bisects HJ.
- Because ML is perpendicular to FG, L is the midpoint of FG. Similarly, because MN is perpendicular to HJ, N is the midpoint of HJ.
- Arc HP has a measure of 65 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of arc PJ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FL = 24.
- HJ = 48.
- m(arc HP) = 65 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc PJ, m(arc PJ).
- We know that MN bisects HJ, so HN = NJ = 48 / 2 = 24.
- We can use the fact that congruent chords subtend congruent arcs.
- Since FL = HN = 24 and NJ = 24 we can conclude that FL = NJ

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, perpendicularity, bisection, arc measure, and equality of lengths.
