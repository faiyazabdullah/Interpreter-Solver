PROBLEM 2867 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A D and C G are diameters of \odot B. Find m \widehat A G.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- Points A, C, D, F, G lie on the circle.
- Line segments BC, BD, BA, BF, BG are radii of the circle.
- Line segments AC and GF are diameters of the circle.
- Angle CBD is labeled as 55 degrees.
- Angle GBF is labeled as 35 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AC and GF are diameters, they pass through the center B.
- Angle CBG is a straight angle, thus it is 180 degrees.
- Angle ABG is also a straight angle, thus it is 180 degrees.
- Angle ABF + angle GBF = angle ABG = 180 degrees.
- Angle ABF = 180 - 35 = 145 degrees.
- Points A, G, and F lie on the circle.
- Arc AG is subtended by angle ABG.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle CBD = 55 degrees.
- Angle GBF = 35 degrees.
- Angle CBG = 180 degrees.
- Angle ABG = 180 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc AG.
- The measure of arc AG is equal to the measure of central angle ABG.
- Angle ABG = 180 degrees - Angle CBG

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points on the circle, diameters, angles, and relationships between them.
- Need to represent the measure of arc AG.
