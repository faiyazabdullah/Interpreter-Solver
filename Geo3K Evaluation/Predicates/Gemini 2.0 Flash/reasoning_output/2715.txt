PROBLEM 2715 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a quadrilateral ABCD.
- The angles are labeled as follows: Angle C = (x-12)°, Angle D = (3y-4)°, Angle B = (1.5y)°, Angle A = (4x-8)°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The question implies that the quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram.
- If ABCD is a parallelogram, then opposite angles are equal and consecutive angles are supplementary.
- Thus, Angle A = Angle C and Angle B = Angle D. Also, Angle A + Angle B = 180° and Angle C + Angle D = 180°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of Angle A = (4x - 8)°
- Measure of Angle B = (1.5y)°
- Measure of Angle C = (x - 12)°
- Measure of Angle D = (3y - 4)°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- Since Angle A = Angle C in a parallelogram, we can set up an equation (4x - 8) = (x - 12).
- Since Angle B = Angle D in a parallelogram, we can set up an equation (1.5y) = (3y - 4).
- These equations are sufficient to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to create predicates for:
    - Quadrilateral ABCD
    - Measure of the four angles A, B, C, D
    - The equality of measures of Angle A and Angle C when the quadrilateral is a parallelogram
    - The equality of measures of Angle B and Angle D when the quadrilateral is a parallelogram
    - Sum of measures of Angle A and Angle B is 180
