PROBLEM 2966 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find z in the given parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD.
- The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point F.
- Point E lies on side BC.
- The length of CE is given as 3z-4.
- The length of FD is given as z+5.
- In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram.
- AC and BD are diagonals of the parallelogram.
- F is the intersection point of the diagonals.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, F is the midpoint of AC and BD.
- Therefore, CF = AF and BF = FD.
- Also, since E lies on BC, CE is a segment of BC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CE = 3z - 4
- FD = z + 5
- Since F is the midpoint of BD, we have BF = FD, hence BF = z + 5.
- So, length of BF = z+5 and length of FD = z+5, therefore, Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,F)), LengthOf(Line(F,D))).
- Because F is the midpoint of BD, LengthOf(Line(B,F)) = LengthOf(Line(F,D)).
- Given FD = z+5, and BF=FD, so BF = z+5.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the value of z.
- In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, thus BF = FD.
- From the given diagram, FD = z+5.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram.
- Represent the diagonals AC and BD intersecting at F.
- Represent that F is the midpoint of BD.
- Represent the given expressions for CE and FD.
- Finally, represent the equality BF=FD.
