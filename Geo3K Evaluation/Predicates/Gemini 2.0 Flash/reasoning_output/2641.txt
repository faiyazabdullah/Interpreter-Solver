PROBLEM 2641 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle A B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- There is a line CD that extends from line BC
- Angle ACD is labeled as 148 degrees
- Angle A is labeled as (2x-15) degrees
- Angle B is labeled as (x-5) degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angles ACD and ACB are supplementary angles, summing to 180 degrees.
- The sum of the interior angles of triangle ABC is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle ACD = 148 degrees
- m \angle A = (2x-15) degrees
- m \angle B = (x-5) degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle ABC
- First, we need to find the value of x.
- To find the value of x, we need to set up an equation.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, points, lines, and angles.
- Include the supplementary angles and the sum of angles in a triangle.
- Represent the relationships between the angles in triangle ABC.
