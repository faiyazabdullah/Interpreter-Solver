PROBLEM 2494 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify multiple points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P
- I can identify multiple lines. For example, Line(G,K), Line(M,C), Line(D,N). Line(A,O), Line(E,F).
- The figure contains parallel lines indicated by arrows. Line(G,K) is parallel to Line(M,C) is parallel to Line(D,N). Line(A,O) and Line(E,F) intersect the parallel lines.
- I can identify segments with equal length due to the congruent marks between Line(L,I) and Line(H,P). Also, Line(I,L) and Line(B,I).
- I can see measurements given: 2x+3, (4/3)y + 1, 6-x, 2y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line(G,K) is parallel to Line(M,C) and Line(D,N)
- Line(A,O) and Line(E,F) act as transversals
- Since Line(G,K), Line(M,C), Line(D,N) are parallel and segments LI = HI = IB = HP, we can say the segments on the transversals are equal. LI=IB and HI=HP.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of LI is 2x+3
- The length of IB is 6-x
- The length of HI is (4/3)y + 1
- The length of HP is 2y
- Because Line(G,K), Line(M,C), Line(D,N) are parallel and LI = IB, then 2x + 3 = 6 - x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the value of x.
- We can use the equality 2x + 3 = 6 - x

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We will need to define points and lines
- We will need to define parallel relationships between lines
- We will need to define the segment lengths
