PROBLEM 2811 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AC is marked as 16 units.
- Side BC is marked as 10 units.
- Angle B is labeled as x degrees.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.
- x is the measure of angle ABC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 16 units (given)
- BC = 10 units (given)
- Angle ABC = x degrees (unknown)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- This requires using trigonometric ratios (Tan, Cos, or Sin) with respect to angle B.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and trigonometric relationships.
