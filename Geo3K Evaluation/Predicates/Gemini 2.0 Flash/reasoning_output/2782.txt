PROBLEM 2782 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side BC is marked as 14√3 units
- Angle ABC is marked as 30 degrees
- Side AC is marked as x
- Side AB is marked as y
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 14√3 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 30 degrees (given)
- AC = x (variable to be found)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x
- We know angle ABC and side BC
- We can use the tangent function since we are looking for x which is opposite angle B and we know BC which is adjacent to angle B

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include trigonometric relationship for solving
