PROBLEM 2836 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Circles G, J, and K all intersect at L. If G H = 10, find the measure. Find J L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three circles: Circle G, Circle J, and Circle K.
- The three circles intersect at point L.
- Points B, G, and H are on Circle G.
- Points D, J, and L are on Circle J.
- Points C, K, and L are on Circle K.
- Line segment G H is visible and its length is given as 10.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- G H appears to be a diameter of Circle G.
- J L appears to be a radius of Circle J.
- Since L is the intersection point of all three circles, it lies on each circle.
- The circles are nested, and Circle K is the smallest one.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(Line(G, H)) = 10. Since G H is a diameter of Circle G, the radius of Circle G is half of its diameter, which is 5.
- The problem asks to find J L, which appears to be the radius of circle J.
- From the image, the diameter of circle G appears to be twice the diameter of Circle J.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to determine the length of J L.
- Since G H = 10 is the diameter of Circle G, its radius is 5.
- The relative sizes of the circles can give a hint about the relationship between the radii of Circle G and Circle J.
- The diagram shows that diameter of Circle G is twice the diameter of Circle J. Therefore, radius of Circle G is twice the radius of Circle J.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define all points, circles, lines and relationships
- Define that G H is a diameter of Circle G.
- Define that J L is the radius of Circle J.
- Define the length of G H is equal to 10.
