PROBLEM 2653 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 6 if m \angle 1 = 30.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- There is a point A at the intersection of the diagonals WZ and XY.
- There are lines connecting the vertices to form the sides and diagonals.
- Angle 6 is formed by sides WY and YX.
- Angle 1 is formed by sides XW and XY.
- Angle Y is a right angle.
- Angle Z is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle, which implies opposite sides are parallel and all angles are right angles.
- Diagonals WZ and XY bisect each other.
- Angle 6 and Angle 5 are complementary angles.
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are complementary angles.
- Angle 7 and Angle 8 are complementary angles.
- Angle 3 and Angle 4 are complementary angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 30 degrees (given)
- m \angle 6 is the unknown.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 6, given that the measure of angle 1 is 30 degrees and WXYZ is a rectangle.
- In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. Thus, Triangle WXA is isosceles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle, points, lines, angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Express the properties of the rectangle (parallel sides, right angles, equal diagonals).
