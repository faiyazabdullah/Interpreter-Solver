PROBLEM 2723 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T
- Side RS is labeled as 2z - 15 units
- Side ST is labeled as 7 units
- Side RT is labeled as 9 units
- There are angles at vertices R, S, and T.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RST is a triangle with sides RS, ST, and RT.
- The sides have lengths 2z - 15, 7, and 9.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RS = 2z - 15 units
- ST = 7 units
- RT = 9 units
- The question asks to find the value of z.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- To find z, we need to know more information about the angles or side lengths.
- Since only side lengths are given, the triangle inequality is applicable
- The triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, sides, lengths and apply triangle inequality.
