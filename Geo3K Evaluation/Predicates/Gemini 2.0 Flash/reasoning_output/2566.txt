PROBLEM 2566 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the height of the parallelogram given its area with 2000 square units.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- I can see a point E on line segment AD.
- I can see a line segment BE perpendicular to AD.
- I can see that the length of BE is x.
- I can see that the length of BC is x+10.
- I am given that the area of the parallelogram is 2000.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram.
- BE is the height of the parallelogram with respect to base AD (or BC).
- BC is parallel to AD.
- Area of parallelogram = base * height.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BE = x.
- Length of BC = x+10.
- Area of parallelogram ABCD = 2000.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- I need to find the height of the parallelogram, which is x.
- I am given that the area is 2000.
- The area of a parallelogram is base times height, so (x+10) * x = 2000.
- I need to represent these relationships in predicates.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the parallelogram.
- Define the height and base.
- Define the area of the parallelogram.
- Define the relationship between area, base and height.
