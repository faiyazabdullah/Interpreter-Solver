PROBLEM 2934 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB has a length of 14 * sqrt(3)
- Side AC is labeled as x
- Side BC is labeled as y
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A
- Angle ABC is labeled as 30 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse
- Angle ABC is 30 degrees

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 14 * sqrt(3) (given)
- AC = x (given, unknown)
- BC = y (given, unknown)
- Angle ABC = 30 degrees (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of y (BC)
- This requires using trigonometric relationships with the given angle and side
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides and angle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include trigonometric relationship for solving
