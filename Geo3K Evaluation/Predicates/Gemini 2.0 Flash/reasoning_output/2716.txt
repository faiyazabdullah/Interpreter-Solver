PROBLEM 2716 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 33 units
- Side BC is marked as 66 units
- Side AC is marked as x
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 33 units (given)
- BC = 66 units (given)
- AC = x, the unknown we want to find
- The right angle at A means we can use the Pythagorean theorem

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AC (x)
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for solving
