PROBLEM 2448 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- The length of side AB is 20.
- Angle ABC is marked as 60 degrees.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.
- Side AC is labeled as x.
- Side BC is labeled as y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AB = 20 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 60 degrees (given)
- Length of AC = x
- Length of BC = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of y (Length of BC).
- This requires using trigonometric ratios. Since we know the hypotenuse and an angle, we can use sine to find the opposite side (AC) or cosine to find the adjacent side (BC).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include trigonometric relationships for solving.
