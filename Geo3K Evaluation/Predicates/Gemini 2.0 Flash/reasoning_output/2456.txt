PROBLEM 2456 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If m \widehat F E = 118, m \widehat A B = 108, m \angle E G B = 52, and m \angle E F B = 30, find m \widehat C F.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points A, B, C, E, F on it.
- There are line segments AB, BE, EF, CF, AC.
- There is a point D outside the circle and line segments DA and DC.
- There is a point G inside the circle where CE and BF intersect.
- There is an angle EGB.
- There are arcs FE and AB.
- There is an angle EFB.
- The measurements of arcs FE and AB, and angles EGB and EFB are given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The points A, B, C, E, F lie on the circle.
- The line segments AB, BE, EF, CF, AC are chords of the circle.
- CE and BF are chords intersecting at G.
- Angle EGB is formed by the intersection of chords CE and BF.
- Angle EFB is an inscribed angle.
- Arc FE and AB are intercepted arcs.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of arc FE is 118.
- Measure of arc AB is 108.
- Measure of angle EGB is 52.
- Measure of angle EFB is 30.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc CF.
- Angle EGB is the average of the measures of arcs FE and BC.
- Angle EFB intercepts arc BE. Therefore, the measure of arc BE is twice the measure of angle EFB.
- The sum of the measures of arcs CF, FE, EB, and BC is 360.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points on the circle, angles, arcs, and their measures.
- Need to represent the relationship between inscribed angles and intercepted arcs.
- Need to represent the relationship between the angle formed by intersecting chords and the intercepted arcs.
- Need to represent that the total degree measure of a circle is 360.
