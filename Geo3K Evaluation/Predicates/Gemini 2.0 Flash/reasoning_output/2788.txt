PROBLEM 2788 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: Triangle BDE and Triangle ACE
- Points are labeled A, B, C, D, E
- Angles are labeled 75 degrees at D, 35 degrees at B, 28 degrees at C, angle 1 at E, angle 2 at E, and angle 3 at A
- Lines are BD, DE, BE, AE, CE, and AC.
- Point E lies on line BC.
- Point E lies on line AD.
- Angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle BDE and Triangle ACE are not explicitly similar or congruent.
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 form a linear pair, so they are supplementary, therefore they sum to 180.
- The sum of angles in triangle BDE is 180.
- The sum of angles in triangle ACE is 180.
- Angle BEA and angle 2 are vertical angles so they are congruent.
- Angle AED and angle 3 are vertical angles so they are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle D = 75 degrees
- m \angle B = 35 degrees
- m \angle C = 28 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 1.
- m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 = 180 degrees.
- In triangle BDE, we know m \angle D and m \angle B. We can find m \angle 1 by finding the supplementary angle to m \angle 2.
- m \angle 1 = 180 - (m \angle D + m \angle B) = 180 - (75 + 35) = 180 - 110 = 70

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- Represent angle measurements.
- Represent the supplementary relationship between angle 1 and angle 2.
- Represent the vertical angle relationship between angles.
- Represent the sum of the angles in each triangle equaling 180 degrees.
