PROBLEM 2878 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \angle 1 and \angle 2 form a linear pair and m \angle 2 = 67. Find the measure of \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two lines AD and BC intersecting at point C.
- There are two angles, \angle 1 and \angle 2, formed by the intersection of lines AD and BC at point C.
- A, C, and D are points on a line.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \angle 1 and \angle 2 form a linear pair.
- Linear pairs are supplementary.
- This means the sum of \angle 1 and \angle 2 equals 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of \angle 2 is given as 67 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of \angle 1.
- This can be found using the fact that \angle 1 and \angle 2 are supplementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the angles, the linear pair relationship, and the given measurement.
- Need to show the supplementary relationship of the angles.
