PROBLEM 2778 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with center A.
- I see points X, Z, Y, W on the circle.
- I see lines XW, ZY, and a line passing through W, Y, T.
- Lengths are given: XW = 12, WT = 7, YT = 6.
- The unknown length ZY is labeled x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ZY and XW are chords of the circle.
- TWY is a secant of the circle.
- By the power of a point theorem, the product of the segments of one secant equals the product of the segments of the other secant/tangent from the same external point. Since TWY is secant to the circle at W and Y.
Then, $TW \cdot TY = TX \cdot TZ$. This is not correct here.
The intersecting secant theorem applies:  $TW \cdot (TW + XW) = TY \cdot (TY+ZY)$.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XW = 12
- WT = 7
- YT = 6
- ZY = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of x.
- We need to use the intersecting secant theorem to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, points, line segments and their lengths.
- We need to apply the intersecting secant theorem.
