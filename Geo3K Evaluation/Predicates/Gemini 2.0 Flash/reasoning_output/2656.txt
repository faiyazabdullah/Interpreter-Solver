PROBLEM 2656 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD.
- Side AD is labeled as 13 yd.
- Side AC is labeled as 10 yd.
- There is a perpendicular line DE to side BC.
- Angle CBE is 45 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, so AD is parallel to BC, and AB is parallel to CD.
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent, so AD = BC and AB = CD.
- Angle CBE is part of angle ABC of the parallelogram.
- Triangle DEB is a right triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 13 yd
- AC = 10 yd
- Angle CBE = 45 degrees
- Angle DEB is 90 degrees since DE is perpendicular to BC.
- Therefore triangle DEB is a 45-45-90 triangle
- In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are congruent. So DE = BE

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- The area of a parallelogram is base times height.
- BC is the base, which has a length of 13 yd.
- DE is the height.
- Need to find the length of DE.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent parallelogram ABCD.
- Represent the lengths of AD and AB.
- Represent the perpendicularity of DE to BC.
- Represent the measure of angle CBE.
- Represent the right angle DEB.
- Represent the 45-45-90 triangle DEB and relationships between its sides.
