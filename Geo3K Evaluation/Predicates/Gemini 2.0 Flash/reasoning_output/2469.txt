PROBLEM 2469 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 3 inches.
- Angle A and Angle B are marked as (2x) degrees.
- Side AC and side AB have congruent markings
- Side BC is marked as (4y-5) inches.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle because side AB and AC have the same congruent markings.
- Because triangle ABC is isosceles, angle A and B are equal
- Side AC and side AB are equal in length

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 3 inches (given)
- angle A = (2x) degrees
- angle B = (2x) degrees
- BC = (4y-5) inches.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x
- This requires using the properties of the triangle.
- Need to establish the relationship between the angles.
- Sum of angles in the triangle is 180

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the fact that is an isosceles triangle, measurements and relationships
- Must include the sum of the angles of a triangle to solve.
