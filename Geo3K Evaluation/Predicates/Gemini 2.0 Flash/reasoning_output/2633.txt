PROBLEM 2633 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m \angle 2 = 2 x, m \angle 3 = x. Find m \angle 3.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with center A.
- Points F, B, A, H are collinear, forming a line.
- Points G, B, A, J are collinear, forming a line.
- Angle 1 is formed at point H, with a right angle mark.
- Angle 2 is formed at point G.
- Angle 3 is formed at point J.
- I see the measures of angle 2 and angle 3 labeled as 2x and x, respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line FH is a diameter of the circle.
- Line GJ is a diameter of the circle.
- Triangle GHJ is inscribed in the circle.
- Angle 1 is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠2 = 2x
- m∠3 = x
- m∠1 = 90 degrees (right angle)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the measure of angle 3, which is x.
- Since triangle GHJ is inscribed in a circle and angle 1 is a right angle, the hypotenuse GJ is a diameter.
- Therefore, triangle GHJ is a right triangle.
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Thus, m∠1 + m∠2 + m∠3 = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and points on it.
- Define the triangle and its angles.
- Define the diameters of the circle.
- Define the right angle.
- Define the angle measurements.
- Relate the angles of the triangle summing to 180.
