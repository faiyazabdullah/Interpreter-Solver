PROBLEM 2763 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A C is a diagonal of rhombus A B C D. If m \angle C D E is 116, what is m \angle A C D?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus ABCD.
- Point E lies on the line AD extended.
- Angle CDE is labeled as 116 degrees.
- AC is a diagonal of the rhombus ABCD.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are congruent.
- Opposite angles of a rhombus are congruent.
- The diagonal AC bisects angles BAD and BCD.
- AD is a straight line extended to E, therefore angles ADE and CDE are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle CDE is 116 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle ACD.
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, AD || BC. So angle CDE is an exterior angle to angle BCD.
- Since AD || BC, angle BCD and angle ADC are supplementary angles.
- Also, in a rhombus, the diagonal AC bisects angle BCD, so angle ACD is equal to angle ACB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define Rhombus ABCD
- Define Line(A,D) extending to point E
- Define measure of Angle CDE = 116
- Define that AC is a diagonal of rhombus ABCD
