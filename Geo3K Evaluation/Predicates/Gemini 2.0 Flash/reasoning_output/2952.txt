PROBLEM 2952 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For trapezoid Q R S T, A and B are midpoints of the legs. Find m \angle S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a trapezoid QRST.
- Points A and B are on sides QT and RS respectively.
- Line AB is parallel to both QR and TS.
- The length of TS is given as 12.
- The length of QR is given as 20.
- Angle T is given as 120 degrees.
- Angle R is given as 45 degrees.
- A and B are midpoints of QT and RS, respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- QRST is a trapezoid.
- AB is a midsegment of the trapezoid QRST.
- TS is parallel to AB and QR.
- Angle T and Angle Q are supplementary, similarly, Angle S and Angle R.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of TS = 12.
- Length of QR = 20.
- Measure of Angle T = 120 degrees.
- Measure of Angle R = 45 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of Angle S.
- We know Angle R = 45 degrees, and Angle S and Angle R are supplementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the trapezoid QRST.
- Define the points A and B.
- Define lengths of sides TS and QR.
- Define the measures of angles T and R.
- Define A as the midpoint of QT, and B as the midpoint of RS.
