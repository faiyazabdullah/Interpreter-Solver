PROBLEM 2818 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC.
- There is a right angle at vertex C.
- The side opposite angle B is x.
- The hypotenuse is y.
- The side adjacent to angle B is 10 * sqrt(3).
- Angle B is 30 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- I can use trigonometric functions to relate the sides and angles.
- Since I have the side adjacent to the 30-degree angle, and I want to find the side opposite to the 30-degree angle, I can use the tangent function.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC measures 30 degrees.
- Side BC has a length of 10 * sqrt(3).
- Side AC has a length of x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- I will use the tangent of angle B to relate the sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, its properties (right angle), the given angle measurement, and the length of the adjacent side.
- Represent the relationship between the tangent of angle B, the opposite side, and the adjacent side.
