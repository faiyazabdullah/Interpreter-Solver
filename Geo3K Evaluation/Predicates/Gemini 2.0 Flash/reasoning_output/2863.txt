PROBLEM 2863 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 7 if m \angle 4 = m \angle 5.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows several triangles and a straight line.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G are labeled.
- Line segments AB, BC, BD, BE, CF, AE are visible.
- Angles are labeled with numerical values and degrees.
- Side lengths are labeled as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points C, B, A, G lie on the same line.
- m \angle CBA and 136Â° are supplementary angles
- Several triangles are formed: triangle CBF, triangle CBD, triangle ABE.
- m \angle 4 = m \angle 5

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle F = 63 degrees
- Angle FBC = 69 degrees
- Angle CBA = 47 degrees
- Angle EAG = 136 degrees
- CB = 2
- BF = 1
- BA = 6
- BE = 7
- CD = 5
- BD = 4
- BC = 5
- AB = 3

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 7, where BE=7

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- Define the given angle measures.
- State equality between angles 4 and 5.
- State that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- Represent supplementary angles at point A.
