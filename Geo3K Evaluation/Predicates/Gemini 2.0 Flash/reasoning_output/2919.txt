PROBLEM 2919 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: One diagonal of a rhombus is twice as long as the other diagonal. If the area of the rhombus is 169 square millimeters, what are the lengths of the diagonals?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus with vertices labeled conceptually as A, B, C, and X.
- The diagonals of the rhombus are shown as dashed lines.
- The length of one diagonal (AX) is labeled as 2x.
- The length of the other diagonal (BC) is labeled as x.
- The area of the rhombus is stated to be 169 square millimeters.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a rhombus, so its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other.
- The area of a rhombus is half the product of the lengths of its diagonals.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of diagonal AX = 2x
- Length of diagonal BC = x
- Area of rhombus = 169 square millimeters

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the lengths of the diagonals, so we need to find the values of x and 2x.
- We can use the formula for the area of a rhombus to relate x and 2x to the given area.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the rhombus.
- Define the lengths of the diagonals in terms of x.
- State the area of the rhombus.
- State the relationship between the area, the diagonals.
