PROBLEM 2967 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If C E = t - 2. E B = t + 1, C D = 2, and C A = 10, find C E.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Points D and E lie on sides AC and BC, respectively.
- Line segment DE is parallel to line segment AB.
- The length of CD is 2.
- The length of CA is 10.
- The length of CE is t - 2.
- The length of EB is t + 1.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since DE is parallel to AB, triangle CDE is similar to triangle CAB.
- This similarity implies that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
- We have the ratios CD/CA = CE/CB.
- CB = CE + EB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CD = 2
- CA = 10
- CE = t - 2
- EB = t + 1
- CB = CE + EB = (t - 2) + (t + 1) = 2t - 1

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of CE.
- Since CD/CA = CE/CB, we have 2/10 = (t - 2)/(2t - 1).
- From this equation, we can solve for t.
- Then we can substitute the value of t into CE = t - 2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points A, B, C, D, and E.
- Define triangle ABC.
- Define the line segments AB, AC, BC, DE, CD, CE, and EB.
- State that point D lies on line segment AC.
- State that point E lies on line segment BC.
- State that DE is parallel to AB.
- State the given lengths CD = 2 and CA = 10.
- State that CE = t - 2 and EB = t + 1.
- State that CB = CE + EB.
- State that triangle CDE is similar to triangle CAB.
- Express the ratio of corresponding sides as CD/CA = CE/CB.
