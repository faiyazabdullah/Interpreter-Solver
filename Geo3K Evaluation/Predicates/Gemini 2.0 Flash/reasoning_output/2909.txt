PROBLEM 2909 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three points W, X, and Z which form a triangle WXZ.
- Inside of the triangle WXZ, I see a point Y.
- I see a triangle XYZ and a triangle WXY.
- I see the measure of the angle W at vertex W is 23 degrees.
- I see the measure of the angle X formed by W, X, and Z is 105 degrees.
- I see the measure of the angle Z formed by X, Z, and W is 24 degrees.
- I see the measure of the angle 1 at vertex Y of triangle XYZ.
- I see the measure of angle 3 at vertex X formed by Y, X, and W.
- I see the measure of angle 2 at vertex Z formed by Y, Z, and X.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- I can see that angles 3 and the given 105 degree angle are supplementary.
- I know that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- The large triangle WXZ has angles W, X, and Z and the angles are 23, 105, and 24 degrees respectively.
- The triangle XYZ has angles Y, Z, and X and the angles are 1, 2, and XYZ respectively.
- I can see that angle X in triangle XYZ is supplementary to the 105 degree angle at vertex X.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MeasureOf(Angle(W)) = 23
- MeasureOf(Angle(X)) = 105
- MeasureOf(Angle(Z)) = 24

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- I need to find m \angle 1.
- I can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180.
- I can first calculate the measure of angle 3.
- I also need the measure of angle 2 in triangle XYZ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all triangles, points, lines, angles and their measurements.
- Represent the supplementary angles.
- Represent the sum of angles in triangle XYZ.
