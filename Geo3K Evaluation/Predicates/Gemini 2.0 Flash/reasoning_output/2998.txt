PROBLEM 2998 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 14 units
- Side AC is labeled as x
- Side BC is labeled as y
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A
- Angle ACB is marked as 60 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse
- Angle ACB is 60 degrees which makes Angle ABC 30 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 14 units (given)
- AC = x units (given)
- BC = y units (given)
- Angle ACB = 60 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of y, which is the length of the hypotenuse BC
- This requires using trigonometric ratios, namely Cos(60) = x/y, Sin(60) = 14/y, or Tan(60) = 14/x
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides and the angle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include trigonometric ratio for solving
