PROBLEM 2473 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure with points A, B, C, and D.
- Line segments AD, DC, AB, BC, and DB are visible.
- Lengths of line segments are labeled as follows: AD = 6x + 2, DC = 8, AB = 9x - 2, BC = 10.
- Angle DBC is shown as bisected, indicated by the arc.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point D lies on line AC. Therefore, AD + DC = AC.
- Line BD bisects angle ABC.
- Triangle ABC and triangle DBC are present.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 6x + 2
- DC = 8
- AB = 9x - 2
- BC = 10
- BD bisects angle ABC, which implies Angle ABD = Angle DBC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is to find the value of x.
- The angle bisector theorem can be applied here.
- According to the angle bisector theorem, if BD bisects angle ABC, then AD/CD = AB/BC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all the points, lines, and their lengths.
- Define the angle bisector relationship.
- Apply the angle bisector theorem as a predicate.
