PROBLEM 2926 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the trapezoid.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Side AD is marked as 15 cm.
- Side AB is marked as 14 cm.
- Side BD is marked as 10 cm.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A and D.
- The quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid with bases AD and BC, and legs AB and CD.
- Sides AD and BD are perpendicular.
- Sides AB and AD are perpendicular.
- Angle DAB and Angle ADC are right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 15 cm (given)
- AB = 14 cm (given)
- BD = 10 cm (given)
- We are trying to calculate the area of the trapezoid.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the trapezoid.
- The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of bases) * height
- In this case, AD and BC are the bases and AB is the height. We need to find the length of base BC to compute the area.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, right angles, measurements and relationships.
- Need to represent the formula for the area of the trapezoid.
