PROBLEM 2512 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- There is a point D on line AC.
- There are right angle symbols at angles ADB and CDB.
- The length of segment AD is 10.
- The length of segment AB is 12.
- The length of segment CD is z.
- The length of segment BC is y.
- The length of segment BD is x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ADB is a right triangle with right angle at D.
- Triangle CDB is a right triangle with right angle at D.
- Line BD is perpendicular to line AC.
- Triangles ABC, ADB, and BDC are similar.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 10 units (given)
- AB = 12 units (given)
- CD = z units (given)
- BC = y units (given)
- BD = x units (given)
- AC = AD + CD = 10 + z

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x.
- This can be found using similar triangles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, right angles, measurements, perpendicularity, and relationships.
- Relate the similar triangles to each other.
