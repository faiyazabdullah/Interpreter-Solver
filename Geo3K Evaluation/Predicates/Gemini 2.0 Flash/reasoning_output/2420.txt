PROBLEM 2420 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find D E.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: Triangle ABC and Triangle DEF.
- Triangle ABC has a right angle at C and side lengths AC = 45 and BC = 15.
- Triangle DEF has a right angle at F and side length EF = 3.
- Angle D in triangle DEF is labeled as x.
- Angle A in triangle ABC is also labeled as x.
- Triangle ABC and triangle DEF have right angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle A in Triangle ABC is congruent to angle D in Triangle DEF.
- Angle C in Triangle ABC and angle F in Triangle DEF are both right angles, so they are congruent.
- Since two angles in Triangle ABC are congruent to two angles in Triangle DEF, the triangles are similar by AA similarity.
- Since Triangle ABC is similar to Triangle DEF, corresponding sides are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length AC = 45
- Length BC = 15
- Length EF = 3
- Angle A = Angle D = x
- Angle C = Angle F = 90 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- I need to find the length of DE.
- The triangles are similar, so I can set up a proportion.
- BC / EF = AC / DF = AB / DE
- Since I want DE, I need to know AB. AB = sqrt(AC^2 + BC^2) = sqrt(45^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(2025 + 225) = sqrt(2250) = 15 * sqrt(10)
- Then BC / EF = AB / DE
- 15 / 3 = 15*sqrt(10) / DE
- DE = 3 * sqrt(10)
- I could also use AC/DF = BC/EF to find DF = AC * EF / BC = 45 * 3 / 15 = 9
Then I can use Pythagorean theorem to solve for DE = sqrt(DF^2 + EF^2) = sqrt(81 + 9) = sqrt(90) = 3*sqrt(10)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and triangles.
- State the known side lengths.
- State that angles A and D are congruent.
- State that angles C and F are right angles.
- State that triangles ABC and DEF are similar.
- Write out the proportions of the sides.
