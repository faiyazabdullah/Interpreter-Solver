PROBLEM 2975 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Tangent M P is drawn to \odot O. Find x if M O = 20.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- Point M is outside the circle.
- Line MP is tangent to the circle at point P.
- A radius AP is drawn from the center of the circle to point P.
- Line MO connects the center of the circle to the external point M.
- A radius AB is drawn from the center of the circle to point B.
- Length MP is given as 16.
- Length MO is given as 20.
- Length AP is labeled as x.
- Length AB is also x, since it's a radius of the same circle.
- Length PB is 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since MP is tangent to the circle at P, angle MPA is a right angle.
- Therefore, triangle MPA is a right triangle.
- AP and AB are radii of the circle and are therefore equal in length.
- The line segment OB can be expressed as the sum of lengths PB and AB
- OB is x+5.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MP = 16
- MO = 20
- AP = x
- AB = x
- PB = 5
- OB = x+5

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Since MPA is a right triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem: MP^2 + AP^2 = MO^2
- Substituting the given values: 16^2 + x^2 = 20^2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, tangent line, radii, right triangle, and the Pythagorean theorem relationship.
