PROBLEM 2676 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: M N \parallel B C. Solve for x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- There is a line segment MN inside the triangle, with points M on AB and N on AC.
- Side BM is marked as 24 units.
- Side AN is marked as 3x-2 units.
- Side NC is marked as 20 units.
- Side AM is marked as 4x-6 units.
- It is given that MN is parallel to BC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC and triangle AMN are similar since MN is parallel to BC.
- The sides of the similar triangles are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BM = 24
- AN = 3x-2
- NC = 20
- AM = 4x-6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to solve for x.
- I need to use the similarity property of triangles to setup proportions to solve for x.
- AB = AM + MB, so AB = (4x-6) + 24 = 4x + 18
- AC = AN + NC, so AC = (3x-2) + 20 = 3x + 18
- Therefore, the proportion AM/AB = AN/AC, translates to (4x-6)/(4x+18) = (3x-2)/(3x+18)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, points, parallel lines and measurements.
- Establish similarity between the two triangles.
- Establish the side lengths of the two triangles.
- Setup proportions to solve for x.
