PROBLEM 2486 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Circle O has a radius of 13 inches. Radius O B is perpendicular to chord C D which is 24 inches long. If m \widehat C D = 134, find m \widehat C B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- Points C, B, and D lie on the circle.
- Line segment CD is a chord of the circle.
- Line segment OB is a radius of the circle and is perpendicular to chord CD at point X.
- The length of chord CD is 24 inches.
- The radius of the circle is 13 inches.
- The measure of arc CD is 134 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- OB is a radius of the circle.
- CD is a chord of the circle.
- OB is perpendicular to CD at X.
- m(arc CD) = 134 degrees.
- Since OB is perpendicular to CD, it bisects CD at X.
- Therefore, CX = XD = CD/2 = 12.
- OC is a radius of the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of circle O = 13 inches, so OB = OC = 13 inches.
- Chord CD = 24 inches, so CX = XD = 12 inches.
- m(arc CD) = 134 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of arc CB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We will represent circle O, points, lines, angles, measurements, and relationships.
- The perpendicularity and the bisection of the chord will be represented.
- We will express the measure of the arc CD.
