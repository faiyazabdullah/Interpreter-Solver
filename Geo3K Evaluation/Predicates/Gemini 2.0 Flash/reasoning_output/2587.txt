PROBLEM 2587 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: Triangle ADE and Triangle BCE.
- The triangles share a common vertex E where their sides intersect.
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are formed at the intersection point E.
- The image shows Angle D = 47 degrees, Angle A = 57 degrees, Angle B = 55 degrees.
- I can also see that Angle 1 and Angle 2 are vertical angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are vertical angles, so they are congruent, meaning their measures are equal.
- The sum of angles in Triangle ADE is 180 degrees, so Angle AED = 180 - (47 + 57) = 76 degrees.
- Angle 1 and Angle AED are the same angle.
- Therefore, Angle 1 = Angle 2 = 76 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle D = 47 degrees
- Angle A = 57 degrees
- Angle B = 55 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of Angle 2.
- We know Angle 1 is congruent to Angle 2.
- We can calculate Angle 1 (or Angle AED) from Triangle ADE.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles and triangles.
- State the measure of all given angles
- State that Angle 1 and Angle 2 are vertical angles.
- State that the sum of angles in Triangle ADE is 180 degrees
