PROBLEM 2698 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: W T Y \cong T W Y. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center X.
- I can see points T, W, and Y on the circumference of the circle.
- I can see lines TX, TY, WX, WY, and XY.
- I can see angle TWY which has a measure of 2x + 10.
- I can see angle TXY which has a measure of 4x.
- Triangle TWY is inscribed in the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- TX, WX, and XY are radii of the circle, and therefore TX = WX = XY.
- Triangles TXY and WXY are isosceles triangles.
- Angles TXW and TYW are inscribed angles.
- Arcs TY and WY subtend angles at the center X.
- It is given that triangle TWY is congruent to triangle YTW.
- This is incorrect, it is implied the given triangles are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle TXY = 4x
- Measure of angle TWY = 2x + 10

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- I need to determine the value of x, given that triangle TWY is congruent to triangle YTW. Since it is given that triangle TWY is congruent to triangle YTW, and that XY=WX=TX (radii of circle X), then arc(TY) should equal arc(WY) therefore the angle at the center subtended by arc(TY) will equal the angle at the center subtended by arc(WY), which is 4x+4x=8x=360, x=45. However the question asks for the value of x. Also angles TXY and WXY will then equal one another if their arcs TY and WY are equal.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to create predicates to represent the circle, points, lines, and angles.
- Represent the fact that TX, WX, and XY are radii and hence equal.
- Represent that measure of angle TXY = 4x, and measure of angle TWY = 2x + 10.
- Represent congruence of Triangles TWY and YTW.
