PROBLEM 2696 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the length of A C in the isosceles triangle A B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AC is marked as 4x + 1
- Side BC is marked as 5x - 0.5
- Side AB is marked as 9x - 1
- There are congruence markings on sides AC and BC indicating they are of equal length

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle, with sides AC and BC being congruent
- The base of the isosceles triangle is AB

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 4x + 1
- BC = 5x - 0.5
- AB = 9x - 1
- Since the triangle is isosceles and AC is congruent to BC, we have AC = BC

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AC
- This requires finding the value of x
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, congruence, measurements, and relationships
- Must include the equality of side lengths of AC and BC for solving
