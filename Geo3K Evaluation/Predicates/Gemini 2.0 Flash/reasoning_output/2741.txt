PROBLEM 2741 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Equilateral pentagon P Q R S T is inscribed in \odot U. Find m \angle P S R.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center U.
- I can see a pentagon PQRST inscribed in the circle.
- The pentagon PQRST is labeled as an equilateral pentagon.
- I can see the points P, Q, R, S, and T on the circle.
- I can see angles like PSR.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the pentagon is equilateral, all its sides are congruent.
- The pentagon is inscribed in the circle, so all its vertices lie on the circle.
- Since the pentagon is equilateral, all its sides have equal arc measures.
- Angle PSR is an inscribed angle.
- Since the pentagon is equilateral, the arcs PQ, QR, RS, ST, and TP are congruent.
- The measure of arc PR is equal to 2 times the measure of each arc.
- The measure of angle PSR is half the measure of arc PR.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We need to find the measure of angle PSR.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle PSR.
- We need to use the properties of an equilateral pentagon inscribed in a circle to find this angle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, pentagon, points, and their relationships.
- Include the information that the pentagon is equilateral and inscribed in the circle.
- Include the relationship between inscribed angles and their intercepted arcs.
