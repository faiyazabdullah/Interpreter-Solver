PROBLEM 2842 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle D A C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral labeled A, B, C, and D.
- The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram.
- There is a point F where the diagonals AC and BD intersect.
- Measurements are given for sides AD, DC, and AB.
- Angles are given for angle FBC, angle AFB, and angle ADB.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel (AB || DC and AD || BC) and opposite sides are congruent (AB = DC and AD = BC). Also, opposite angles are congruent.
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Thus, AF = FC and BF = FD.
- Alternate interior angles are congruent when parallel lines are cut by a transversal. Thus, angle ADB = angle DBC, and angle DAC = angle BCA.
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 13
- DC = 10
- AB = 3y - 8
- BC = 2x + 7
- angle FBC = 20 degrees
- angle AFB = 49 degrees
- angle ADB = 59 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks us to find the measure of angle DAC.
- angle DAC = angle BCA
- We know angle ADB = 59 degrees, thus angle DBC = 59 degrees.
- Therefore, angle ABD + angle DBC = angle ABC.
- angle ABD = angle FBC = 20 degrees.
- angle ABC = 20 + 59 = 79 degrees
- Since angle ABC = angle ADC, angle ADC = 79 degrees
- In triangle ADC, angle DAC + angle ACD + angle ADC = 180
- angle ACD = angle CAD.
- angle DAC = angle ACB.
- Since AB = DC, 3y - 8 = 10, which is not relevant for the question.
- Since AD = BC, 13 = 2x + 7, which is not relevant for the question.
- angle BFC = 180 - 49 = 131
- angle FCD = 180 - (49 + 20) = 111

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, angles, and parallelogram.
- Express the relationships between angles formed by parallel lines and transversals.
- Use the property that diagonals bisect each other.
- Provide the given measurements for sides and angles.
- Use the property that alternate interior angles are congruent
