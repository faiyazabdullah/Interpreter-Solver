PROBLEM 2908 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three points labeled J, K, L, and M.
- I can see lines connecting these points forming two right triangles: triangle JKL and triangle MKL.
- I see the following lengths are given: Length of segment JK is 5, and length of segment KJ is 20
- There are right angle symbols at angles JLK and JMK.
- There are also variables x, y, z used for the lengths of ML, JL, and KL respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is a right triangle.
- Triangle MKL is a right triangle.
- Point M lies on line JK.
- Line ML is perpendicular to line JK.
- Line KL is perpendicular to line JL.
- Triangles JKL and MKL share a common side KL.
- Triangles JML and JKL are similar.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 5
- KJ = 20 (This is the same as JK which contradicts JK=5, so KJ must actually be length of segment JK + KM)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of y, which represents the length of JL.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points and lines
- Specify right angles.
- Specify given lengths.
- State similarity of triangles JML and JKL, and JKL and MKL.
