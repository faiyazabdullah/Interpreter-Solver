PROBLEM 2643 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- I can see several lines which can be identified by the points they pass through.
- I can see several angles with measurements (7x+9)°, (11x-1)°, (2y+5)°, and (7y-4)°.
- I can see parallel markings indicating that lines HB, GD, and AE are parallel. Similarly, lines HC and AF are parallel.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines HB, GD, and AE are parallel.
- Lines HC and AF are parallel.
- Angle DAF and Angle AEA are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines AF and HC cut by transversal AE, implying that they are equal.
- Angle ADF and Angle DFA are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines AE and GD cut by transversal AF.
- Angle HBF and Angle GDF are alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines HB and GD cut by transversal AF.
- Angle DAE and Angle ADF are alternate interior angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle AFD is (7x+9) degrees.
- Measure of angle DAE is (11x-1) degrees.
- Measure of angle EAD is (11x-1) degrees.
- Measure of angle ADE is (7y-4) degrees.
- Measure of angle EAB is (2y+5) degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Since lines HC and AF are parallel, the alternate interior angles are equal.
- Therefore, (11x-1)° = (7x+9)°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, angles and parallel relationships.
- Represent the equality of the alternate interior angles to find the value of x.
