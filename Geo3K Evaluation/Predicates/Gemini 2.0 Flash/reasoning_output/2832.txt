PROBLEM 2832 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 3.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains four points A, B, C, and D.
- It contains three triangles: Triangle ABC, Triangle BCD and Triangle ABD.
- Several angles are labeled with their measures: Angle A = 42 degrees, Angle ABC = 72 degrees, Angle CBD = 38 degrees.
- There are three unnamed angles labeled: Angle 1, Angle 2, and Angle 3.
- Angle 1 is adjacent to Angle CBD.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, B, and D are collinear. Therefore, angles ABC and CBD are adjacent.
- Angles ABC and Angle 1 are supplementary angles because they are angles on a line. This means Angle 1 and Angle ABC sums to 180 degrees
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- In Triangle ABC: Angle A + Angle ABC + Angle 3 = 180 degrees.
- In Triangle BCD: Angle 1 + Angle 2 + Angle D = 180 degrees.
- In Triangle ABD: Angle A + Angle D + Angle ABD = 180 degrees. Where Angle ABD is Angle ABC + Angle CBD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle A = 42 degrees.
- Angle ABC = 72 degrees.
- Angle CBD = 38 degrees.
- The angles are measured in degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of Angle 3.
- To find Angle 3, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- We know Angle A and Angle ABC, so we can calculate Angle 3 in Triangle ABC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need predicates for the points, lines, triangles, and angles.
- We need predicates for the measures of the angles and the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
