PROBLEM 2807 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with points A, B, C, and D on its circumference.
- Lines AD and BC intersect inside the circle at point E.
- The length of AE is labeled as x.
- The length of ED is 4.
- The length of CE is 3.
- The length of EB is 6.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since A, B, C, and D lie on the circle, quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic.
- When two chords intersect inside a circle, the product of the segments of one chord equals the product of the segments of the other chord (Intersecting Chords Theorem).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AE = x
- ED = 4
- CE = 3
- EB = 6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- The Intersecting Chords Theorem applies here.
- Therefore, AE * ED = CE * EB, or x * 4 = 3 * 6.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines, circle, and intersecting chords.
- Represent the given lengths.
- Represent the Intersecting Chords Theorem as a product relationship.
