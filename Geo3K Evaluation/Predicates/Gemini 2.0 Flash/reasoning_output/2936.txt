PROBLEM 2936 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Express the ratio of \tan M as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle labelled as N, P, and M.
- There is a right angle at vertex P.
- Side NP is labeled as 15 units.
- Side PM is labeled as 36 units.
- Side NM is labeled as 39 units.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle NPM is a right triangle with a right angle at P.
- Sides NP and PM are perpendicular.
- Side NM is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- NP = 15 units
- PM = 36 units
- NM = 39 units

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of tan M.
- Tan M = Opposite/Adjacent = NP/PM.
- Need to represent the sides and their relationship to angle M.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationship between sides and angle.
- Use TanOf predicate to represent tan M.
