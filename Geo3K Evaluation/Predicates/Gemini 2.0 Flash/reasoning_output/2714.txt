PROBLEM 2714 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Angle A is labeled as x degrees.
- Angle B is labeled as 2x degrees.
- Angle C is labeled as 2x degrees.
- Angle D is labeled as x degrees.
- The quadrilateral appears to be a trapezoid with bases BC and AD. The trapezoid is isosceles as the base angles are equal.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid because angles A and B are supplementary, and angles C and D are supplementary.
- The trapezoid is isosceles as the base angles are equal.
- The sum of the interior angles of any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle A = x
- Measure of angle B = 2x
- Measure of angle C = 2x
- Measure of angle D = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle B.
- I need to find the value of x first using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
- Once I find x, I can calculate 2x, which is the measure of angle B.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, its angles, and the relationship between them.
- Must include the property that the sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
