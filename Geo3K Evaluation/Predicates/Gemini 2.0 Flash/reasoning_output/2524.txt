PROBLEM 2524 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot Z, \angle W Z X \cong \angle X Z Y, m \angle V Z U = 4 x, m \angle U Z Y = 2 x + 24, and V Y and W U are diameters. Find m \widehat W U X.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center Z.
- There are points V, W, X, Y, U on the circle.
- Lines VZ, WZ, XZ, YZ, UZ are visible, which are radii of the circle.
- Lines VY and WU are diameters of the circle.
- Angles WZX and XZY are marked as congruent.
- Angle VZU is labeled as 4x.
- Angle UZY is labeled as 2x + 24.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Z is the center of the circle.
- V, W, X, Y, U lie on the circle.
- VYU and WZU are straight lines because they are diameters.
- Angle VZU and angle UZY form a part of a straight angle (180 degrees).
- Angles WZX and XZY are congruent.
- Radii of the circle are congruent: VZ, WZ, XZ, YZ, UZ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle VZU = 4x
- Measure of angle UZY = 2x + 24
- Since VY is a diameter, angle VZY is 180 degrees.
- Therefore, m<VZU + m<UZY = 180
- Since WU is a diameter, angle WZU is 180 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc WUX.
- m(arc WUX) = m(arc WX) + m(arc XU)
- m(arc WX) = m<WZX and m(arc XU) = m(arc UZ) + m(arc ZY).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define circle and points.
- Define lines.
- Specify angle measures.
- Specify congruence.
- Define diameters.
- Use straight angle property.
- Relate arc measures to central angle measures.
