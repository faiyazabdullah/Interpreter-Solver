PROBLEM 2588 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m \angle 3 = x - 12 and m \angle 6 = 72. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines AG and ED.
- A transversal line BF intersects both parallel lines at points C and H respectively.
- There are angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- The measure of angle 3 is given as x - 12.
- The measure of angle 6 is given as 72.
- The lines AG and ED are vertical while line BF is oblique.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AG is parallel to ED.
- BF is a transversal.
- Angles 3 and 6 are alternate interior angles.
- Alternate interior angles formed by parallel lines are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 3 = x - 12
- m \angle 6 = 72

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We know that angle 3 and angle 6 are alternate interior angles, therefore they are congruent.
- We can set up the equation x - 12 = 72.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallel lines.
- Need to represent the transversal.
- Need to represent the points of intersection.
- Need to represent the angles.
- Need to represent the measures of the angles.
- Need to represent the congruence relationship between the angles.
- Do not include predicates that directly state the final answer or solution.
