PROBLEM 2969 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The degree measure of minor arc \widehat A C and major arc \widehat A D C are x and y respectively. If m \angle A B C = 70, find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center E.
- There are points A, C, and D on the circumference of the circle.
- There are two tangent lines BA and BC to the circle from point B.
- There are two arcs AC (minor arc) and ADC (major arc)
- I can see \angle ABC, labeled as 70 degrees.
- The measure of minor arc \widehat{AC} is labeled x.
- The measure of major arc \widehat{ADC} is labeled y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since BA and BC are tangents to the circle, \angle EAB = 90 degrees and \angle ECB = 90 degrees.
- The sum of the angles in quadrilateral ABCE is 360 degrees.
- Arc AC (x) and arc ADC (y) form the entire circle. Thus, x + y = 360.
- The measure of an angle formed by two tangents outside a circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Thus,  m\angle ABC = 1/2(m\widehat{ADC} - m\widehat{AC}). 70 = 1/2(y - x).  140 = y - x.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m\angle ABC = 70 degrees
- m\widehat{AC} = x
- m\widehat{ADC} = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find x, the measure of arc AC.
- We have two equations: x + y = 360 and y - x = 140.
- We can solve this system of equations to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all shapes, points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Define Tangent relationship between BA and the circle, and between BC and the circle.
- Define arc measures x and y.
- Define the relationships:  x + y = 360 and y - x = 140.
