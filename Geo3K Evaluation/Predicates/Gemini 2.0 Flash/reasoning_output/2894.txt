PROBLEM 2894 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side AD is marked as 16 ft
- Side DC is marked as 23 ft
- There is an angle at vertex D marked as 60 degrees.
- Point E lies on line DC, and line BE is perpendicular to line DC, forming a right angle at E.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length and parallel.
- Adjacent sides of a parallelogram are not necessarily equal.
- BE is perpendicular to DC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AD = 16 ft
- Length of DC = 23 ft
- Angle ADC = 60 degrees
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD = BC = 16 ft, and DC = AB = 23 ft

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram ABCD.
- The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides: AB + BC + CD + DA
- We know the lengths of all sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, points, sides, measurements, and the fact that it is a parallelogram.
- Also, include that sides AD=BC, and DC=AB.
