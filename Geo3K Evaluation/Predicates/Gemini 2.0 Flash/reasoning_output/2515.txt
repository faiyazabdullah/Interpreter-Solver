PROBLEM 2515 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle R S T \cong \triangle A B C. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles RST and ABC.
- The vertices of the first triangle are labeled R, S, T.
- The vertices of the second triangle are labeled A, B, C.
- Side ST is labeled as 2y-8.
- Side CB is labeled as y+13.
- Angle S is labeled as (5x+20)째.
- Angle B is labeled as (3x+40)째.
- The triangles are congruent: \triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The triangles RST and ABC are congruent.
- Corresponding sides of congruent triangles are equal in length.
- Corresponding angles of congruent triangles are equal in measure.
- ST corresponds to BC.
- Angle S corresponds to Angle B.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of ST = 2y - 8
- Length of BC = y + 13
- Measure of Angle S = (5x + 20)째
- Measure of Angle B = (3x + 40)째
- Since the triangles are congruent, ST = BC, so 2y-8 = y+13
- Since the triangles are congruent, Angle S = Angle B, so 5x+20 = 3x+40

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- Since \triangle RST \cong \triangle ABC, angle S = angle B. Therefore 5x+20 = 3x+40.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines, angles, triangles.
- Represent the congruent triangles.
- Represent the given measurements.
- Represent the equality of corresponding sides and angles.
