PROBLEM 2781 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If A B C D is a rhombus, and m \angle A B C = 70, what is m \angle 1?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rhombus ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Point E is at the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.
- Angle ABC is labeled with a measure.
- Angle 1 is an angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are congruent and opposite sides are parallel.
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other and the angles.
- Angle ABC = 70 degrees
- Angle 1 is formed by the side AB and the diagonal AC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle ABC is given as 70 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of angle 1 (angle BAC).

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1 (angle BAC).
- Because ABCD is a rhombus, angle BAC is half of angle BAE, and angle ABC is 70, adjacent angles are supplementary, and diagonals bisect angles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rhombus, points, lines, and angles.
- Represent the measure of angle ABC.
- Represent the relationship between the angles in the rhombus.
- Represent the fact that diagonals bisect the angles of a rhombus.
