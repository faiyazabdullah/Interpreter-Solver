PROBLEM 2681 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see four points A, B, C, and D.
- There are lines connecting these points: Line(A,D), Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(B,D), Line(B,C)
- There are right angles at angle DBA and angle BAC.
- Length AD = 4, Length AC = 6.
- Line segment AB has length y, line segment BC has length z, line segment BD has length x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle, with a right angle at B.
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle, with a right angle at A.
- Angle DAB and angle ABC are right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 4
- AC = 6
- AB = y
- BC = z
- BD = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find y, which is the length of line AB.
- Since Triangle ABC is a right triangle, by the Pythagorean theorem, AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2, thus y^2 + 6^2 = z^2
- Since Triangle ABD is a right triangle, by the Pythagorean theorem, AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2, thus y^2 + x^2 = 4^2.
- We know that z and x must be positive lengths.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, and triangles.
- State the right angles.
- Give the known lengths.
- Imply the Pythagorean theorem for both triangles.
