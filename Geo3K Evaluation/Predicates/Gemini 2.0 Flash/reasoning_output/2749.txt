PROBLEM 2749 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If Z P = 4 x - 9 and P Y = 2 x + 5, find Z X.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- I can see two diagonals, WY and ZX, intersecting at point P.
- The following labels are present: W, X, Y, Z, P.
- The following line segments are present: WX, XY, YZ, ZW, WY, ZX.
- Numerical expressions associated with segments are: ZP = 4x - 9 and PY = 2x + 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- WXYZ is a rectangle, so its diagonals are congruent and bisect each other.
- Point P is the intersection of the diagonals. Therefore, P is the midpoint of WY and ZX.
- Segments ZP and PY are parts of the diagonals.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of ZP is given as 4x - 9.
- Length of PY is given as 2x + 5.
- Since P is the midpoint of the diagonal ZY, ZP = PY.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of ZX.
- Since diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, ZX = WY.
- We know that ZP = PY, and we can solve for x.
- We have ZP = 4x - 9 and PY = 2x + 5, so 4x - 9 = 2x + 5
- Then, 2x = 14, so x = 7.
- Now we can calculate ZP = (4 * 7) - 9 = 28 - 9 = 19.
- Therefore, ZP = 19 and PY = 19.
- The length of the diagonal ZY = ZP + PY = 19 + 19 = 38.
- Because diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, ZX = WY = 38

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the rectangle WXYZ.
- Define the points W, X, Y, Z, P.
- Define the line segments WX, XY, YZ, ZW, WY, ZX.
- Define the relationship that the diagonals WY and ZX bisect each other at P.
- State the relationship that ZP = 4x - 9 and PY = 2x + 5.
- State that diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, so ZY = WX.
- State that since P is the midpoint of ZY, ZP = PY.
- Formulate an equation stating that ZP = 4x - 9 and PY = 2x + 5.
