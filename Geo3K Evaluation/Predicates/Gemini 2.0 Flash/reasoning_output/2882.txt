PROBLEM 2882 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: G H \cong K J. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center L.
- Points G, H, J, K are on the circle.
- Line segments GH and KJ are chords of the circle.
- The measure of arc GH is 83 degrees.
- The measure of arc KJ is (2x - 27) degrees.
- It is given that the length of chord GH is congruent to the length of chord KJ.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- In a circle, if two chords are congruent, then their corresponding arcs are congruent.
- Therefore, arc GH is congruent to arc KJ.
- Since arc GH is congruent to arc KJ, their measures are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of arc GH = 83 degrees
- Measure of arc KJ = (2x - 27) degrees
- Since the arcs are congruent, we can set their measures equal to each other: 83 = 2x - 27

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We can set up an equation using the given information: 83 = 2x - 27
- We need to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle, points, arcs, and chords.
- Indicate the measures of arcs GH and KJ.
- Specify that chord GH is congruent to chord KJ.
- Specify that arc GH is congruent to arc KJ.
- Specify that the measures of arc GH and arc KJ are equal.
