PROBLEM 2613 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- I can see lines BD and BE which are tangent to the circle at point D and C respectively.
- I can see a line BCE which is a secant of the circle.
- Angle DBC is marked as 50 degrees.
- Angle CBE is marked as (4x+5) degrees.
- Angle DBG is marked as (x+2.5) degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since BD and BE are tangent to the circle at D and C, BD = BC.
- Triangle BCD is isosceles.
- Angle BDC = Angle BCD.
- Angle DBC = 50 degrees.
- Angle BDC + Angle BCD + Angle DBC = 180 degrees.
- Angle BDC + Angle BCD + 50 = 180.
- 2*Angle BCD = 130.
- Angle BCD = 65.
- Angle BCE is supplementary to Angle BCD.
- Angle BCD + Angle BCE = 180.
- 65 + Angle BCE = 180.
- Angle BCE = 115.
- Angle CBE is marked as 4x+5 degrees.
- Angle DBG is marked as x+2.5 degrees.
- Angle DBG + Angle DBC = Angle CBE
- x+2.5+50 = 4x+5
- 52.5 + x = 4x+5
- 47.5 = 3x
- x = 47.5/3 = 15.833

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle DBC = 50 degrees.
- Angle CBE = (4x+5) degrees.
- Angle DBG = (x+2.5) degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, lines, angles and their measurements.
- Since BD and BC are tangent from B, BD is congruent to BC
- Use the tangent secant theorem.
- The predicates should provide enough information to solve for x.
