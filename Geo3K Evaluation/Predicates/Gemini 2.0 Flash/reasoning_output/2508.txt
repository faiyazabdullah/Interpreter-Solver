PROBLEM 2508 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Angle A, Angle B and Angle C are marked with arc symbols to indicate that all angles have the same measure.
- Side AB is labeled as 2x + 11
- Side AC is labeled as 6x - 9

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle because all angles are congruent to each other.
- All sides of an equilateral triangle are congruent to each other.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AB = 2x + 11
- Length of AC = 6x - 9
- Since the triangle is equilateral, AB = AC

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x
- This requires setting up an equation where AB = AC and solve for x

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle and the side lengths.
- Must include relationship of sides being equal to each other.
