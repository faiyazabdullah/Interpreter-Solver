PROBLEM 2766 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two right triangles, triangle ABD and triangle ABC, sharing a common side AB.
- The vertices are labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Side DB has a length of 16.
- Side AB has a length of 15.
- Side BC has the same length as side DB, indicated by the same markings.
- Side AC is labeled as x.
- There are right angle symbols at vertex B in both triangles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle with a right angle at B.
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at B.
- Sides DB and BC are congruent.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular, as are sides AB and BD.
- Sides AD and AC are the hypotenuses of their respective triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DB = 16 units (given)
- AB = 15 units (given)
- BC = 16 units (since BC = DB)
- AC = x (unknown)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AC, which is labeled as 'x'.
- To solve this, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, right angles, measurements, congruency, and relationships.
- Include the Pythagorean theorem to calculate the unknown length.
