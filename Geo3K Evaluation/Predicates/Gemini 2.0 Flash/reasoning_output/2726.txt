PROBLEM 2726 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: triangle LMN and triangle XYZ.
- Triangle LMN has angles: angle L = 65 degrees, angle M = 51 degrees.
- Triangle XYZ has angle X = (4x) degrees.
- Angle M and angle Z are marked as congruent with double arc.
- Angle L and angle Y are marked as congruent with single arc.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- Angle N in triangle LMN can be calculated.
- The two triangles LMN and XYZ are similar based on two congruent angles (AA similarity).
- Angle Y and angle L are congruent. Angle M and angle Z are congruent.
- Since triangle LMN and triangle XYZ are similar, their corresponding angles are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle L = 65 degrees
- Angle M = 51 degrees
- Angle X = (4x) degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x.
- Since triangles LMN and XYZ are similar, we can set up a proportion or use corresponding angles to solve for x.
- In order to determine X, we need to find N, since N corresponds to X.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the two triangles and their vertices.
- Specify the known angle measures.
- Define the congruence relationships between angles.
- Express the similarity between the two triangles.
- Express the relationships between angles in the similar triangles.
- State the sum of angles in a triangle = 180
