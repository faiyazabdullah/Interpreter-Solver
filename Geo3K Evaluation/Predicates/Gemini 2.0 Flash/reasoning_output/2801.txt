PROBLEM 2801 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle A C D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram because its opposite sides seem parallel.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point F.
- Angle AFB measures 49 degrees.
- Angle DBA measures 20 degrees.
- Angle ADB measures 59 degrees.
- Length of AD is 13 units.
- Length of DC is 10 units.
- Length of AB is 3y - 8 units.
- Length of BC is 2x + 7 units.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel and congruent.
- Opposite angles are congruent.
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
- Angle AFB and angle CFD are vertical angles and therefore congruent.
- Angle AFD and angle BFC are vertical angles and therefore congruent.
- Since AB is parallel to DC, angle ABD and angle BDC are alternate interior angles, thus congruent.
- Since AD is parallel to BC, angle ADB and angle DBC are alternate interior angles, thus congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 13
- DC = 10
- AB = 3y - 8
- BC = 2x + 7
- Angle AFB = 49 degrees
- Angle DBA = 20 degrees
- Angle ADB = 59 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle ACD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- State that ABCD is a parallelogram.
- State the lengths of sides AD, DC, AB, BC in terms of the variables.
- Note that opposite sides of the parallelogram are equal.
- Note angle measures of the given angles.
- Note that opposite angles are equal.
- Diagonals bisect each other.
- Alternate interior angles are equal.
