PROBLEM 2489 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle R.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral QRST.
- I can see the vertices Q, R, S, T.
- I can see angles at vertices Q, R, S, T with measures (2x+5)°, x°, (2x+7)°, and x° respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral QRST is not specified to be any special type of quadrilateral.
- The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
- I can relate the angle measurements to find the value of x.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle Q = (2x+5)°
- m \angle R = x°
- m \angle S = (2x+7)°
- m \angle T = x°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle R, which is x°.
- I need to find the value of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, its vertices, and angle measurements.
- Also, I need to represent the relationship between the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral and 360°.
