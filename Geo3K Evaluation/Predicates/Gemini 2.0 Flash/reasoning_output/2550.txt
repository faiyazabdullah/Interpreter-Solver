PROBLEM 2550 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In rhombus A B C D, A B = 2 x + 3 and B C = 5 x. Find A D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD
- The quadrilateral is labeled as a rhombus
- Point E is the intersection of the diagonals
- Side AB is labeled 2x + 3
- Side BC is labeled 5x

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal in length
- AB = BC = CD = DA
- Opposite sides are parallel: AB || CD and AD || BC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2x + 3
- BC = 5x
- The question is asking for AD

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, AD = AB = BC = CD
- Setting AB = BC will allow us to solve for x, then find the length of AD

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus
- Need to represent the equality of sides
- Need to represent the given measurements AB = 2x + 3, BC = 5x
- Need to represent that AD is a side of the rhombus
