PROBLEM 2752 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60. Find the measure of \angle 6.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, W.
- I can see lines that intersect at these points.
- I can see angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- I can see that lines WB and AT are parallel.
- The measure of angle 1 is given as 50.
- The measure of angle 3 is given as 60.
- Line CJ intersects lines WB and AT at points F and G.
- Line IN intersects lines WB and AT at points S and R.
- Line CJ intersects line IN at point P.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line WB is parallel to line AT.
- Angle 1 and angle EFS are vertical angles.
- Angle 3 and angle GKA are vertical angles.
- Angle 4 and angle OSP are vertical angles.
- Angle 5 and angle RPG are vertical angles.
- Angle 6 and angle CPS are vertical angles.
- Angle 2 and angle FPC are vertical angles.
- Angle 7 and angle NPL are vertical angles.
- Angle 8 and angle RQA are vertical angles.
- Angle 1 and angle EFS are congruent.
- Angle 3 and angle GKA are congruent.
- Angle 1 and angle ASF are corresponding angles.
- Angle 3 and angle ARG are corresponding angles.
- Angle ASF and angle CSR are vertical angles.
- Angle ARG and angle QRK are vertical angles.
- Angle 1 and angle CSR are congruent.
- Angle 3 and angle QRK are congruent.
- Since WB and AT are parallel, angle 1 + angle 4 = 180.
- Since WB and AT are parallel, angle 3 + angle 5 = 180.
- Sum of the angles in triangle PSG is 180. Angle 4 + angle 5 + angle 6 = 180.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle 1 is 50.
- Measure of angle 3 is 60.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- I need to find the measure of angle 6.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I will write all the points, lines, and angles present.
- I will declare the parallel lines.
- I will declare the measurements of angle 1 and angle 3.
- I will represent the relationships between the angles as described above.
- This should be enough to find the measure of angle 6.
