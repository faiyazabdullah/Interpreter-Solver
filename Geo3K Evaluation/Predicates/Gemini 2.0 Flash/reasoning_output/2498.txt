PROBLEM 2498 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Point D lies on the line BC.
- Angle ABC is labeled as 27 degrees.
- Angle BAC is labeled as 52 degrees.
- Angle ADC is labeled as 1.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle 1 is an exterior angle of triangle ABD.
- The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle ABC = 27 degrees
- Measure of angle BAC = 52 degrees
- Angle 1 is adjacent to angle ADB.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1.
- Angle 1 is an exterior angle of triangle ABD.
- Measure of angle 1 = Measure of angle ABC + Measure of angle BAC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle ABC and the point D on line BC.
- Need to represent the given angle measurements.
- Need to state that angle 1 is an exterior angle to the triangle ABD.
