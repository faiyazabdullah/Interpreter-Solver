PROBLEM 2638 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle K L N and \triangle L M N are isosceles and m \angle J K N = 130. Find the measure of \angle J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with labeled points J, K, L, M, and N.
- There are three triangles: Triangle KLN, Triangle LMN, and Triangle JKL.
- Angle JLK is marked as 25 degrees, Angle MLN is marked as 20 degrees, and Angle KLN is marked as 18 degrees.
- Triangle KLN and Triangle LMN are marked as isosceles, meaning KL = LN and LN = NM.
- Angle JKN is given as 130.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle KLN and Triangle LMN are isosceles.
- We can infer properties based on the isosceles triangles.
- The goal is to find the measure of angle J.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle JLK = 25 degrees
- Angle MLN = 20 degrees
- Angle KLN = 18 degrees
- Angle JKN = 130 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle J.
- We need to use properties of triangles and angles to deduce the value of angle J.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Capture all points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Record that triangles KLN and LMN are isosceles.
- Record the measurements of the angles JLK, MLN, KLN, and JKN.
