PROBLEM 2645 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find h in the triangle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC.
- The vertices are labeled A, B, and C.
- There is a right angle at vertex A.
- The hypotenuse BC has a length of 22.
- Angle ABC is labeled as 30 degrees.
- The side AC is labeled as h, representing the height.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- Angle BAC is a right angle.
- The length of side BC is 22.
- The measure of angle ABC is 30 degrees.
- We need to find the length of side AC, which is h.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BC = 22
- Angle ABC = 30 degrees
- We need to find the length of AC (h).
- We can use trigonometric ratios (sine) to relate the angle and the sides.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of h.
- We know the hypotenuse and an angle.
- We can use the sine function to relate these values.
- sin(30) = opposite/hypotenuse = h/22

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need predicates to represent:
    - The triangle
    - The right angle
    - The given lengths and angles
    - The variable 'h' representing the height
    - The sine relationship between the angle and the sides
