PROBLEM 2748 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Which of the following facts would be sufficient to prove that line d is parallel to X Z?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a line labeled "d" with points A and B on it.
- I can see a triangle XYZ.
- There is a point Y which is also on line d.
- There are angles labeled 1, 2, and 3 at point Y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line d intersects triangle XYZ at point Y.
- Angle 1 and angle 2 are adjacent.
- Angle 2 and angle 3 are adjacent.
- Angle 1 and angle 3 are non-adjacent.
- The question requires knowing which conditions make line d parallel to line XZ.
- If angle 1 is congruent to angle X, then d is parallel to XZ (Alternate Interior Angles Theorem)
- If angle 3 is congruent to angle Z, then d is parallel to XZ (Alternate Interior Angles Theorem)
- If angle 2 + angle X = 180, then d is parallel to XZ (Same Side Interior Angles Theorem)
- If angle 2 + angle Z = 180, then d is parallel to XZ (Same Side Interior Angles Theorem)

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No measurements are given.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks what is sufficient to prove line d is parallel to XZ.
- This requires knowing the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the lines, triangle, points, and angles.
- Need to represent the relationships between angles and lines.
