PROBLEM 2518 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Express the ratio of \cos X as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle VWX with vertices labeled V, W, X
- Side VW is marked as 72 units
- Side WX is marked as 21 units
- Side VX is marked as 75 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex W

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle VWX is a right triangle with right angle at W
- Sides VW and WX are perpendicular
- Side VX is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- VW = 72 units (given)
- WX = 21 units (given)
- VX = 75 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the cosine of angle X.
- The cosine of angle X is adjacent/hypotenuse = WX/VX

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Need to calculate cosine of X
