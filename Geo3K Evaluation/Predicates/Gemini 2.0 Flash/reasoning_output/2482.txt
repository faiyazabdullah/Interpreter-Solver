PROBLEM 2482 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side BC is marked as 4 units.
- Angle BAC is marked as 45 degrees.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.
- Side AB is labeled as x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.
- Angle BAC is 45 degrees.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.
- Since one angle is 45 degrees and another is 90 degrees, the remaining angle ABC is also 45 degrees, making this a 45-45-90 triangle.
- Therefore, side AC and BC are equal in length.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 4 units (given)
- Angle BAC = 45 degrees (given)
- Length of AB is labeled as x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x (AB).
- This requires understanding the properties of 45-45-90 triangles.
- We know that in a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is sqrt(2) times the length of each leg.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include information that it is a 45-45-90 triangle.
