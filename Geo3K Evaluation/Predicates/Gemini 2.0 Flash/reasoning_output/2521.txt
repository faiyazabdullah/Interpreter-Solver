PROBLEM 2521 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x for the equilateral triangle R S T if R S = x + 9, S T = 2 x, and R T = 3 x - 9.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T
- Side RS is labeled as x + 9
- Side ST is labeled as 2x
- Side RT is labeled as 3x - 9
- The problem states that the triangle RST is an equilateral triangle

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RST is an equilateral triangle, meaning all sides are equal in length
- RS = ST = RT

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RS = x + 9
- ST = 2x
- RT = 3x - 9

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x
- Since it's an equilateral triangle, we can set up equations where the sides are equal to each other

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle and the length of each side
- Also represent that the triangle is equilateral and that all sides are equal
