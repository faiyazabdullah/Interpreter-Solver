PROBLEM 2825 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot P, J K = 10 and \widehat J K L = 134. Find m \widehat J L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center P.
- There are points J, K, L, and M on the circumference of the circle.
- JK and JL are chords of the circle.
- Line segment MM passes through the center P, thus it is a diameter.
- Point Q is the intersection of lines JK and MM.
- Angle JQM is a right angle.
- MM = 6.
- Arc JKL is 134 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JK is a chord.
- MM is a diameter.
- Since angle JQM is a right angle, MM is perpendicular to JK.
- If a radius (or diameter) of a circle is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. Therefore, Q is the midpoint of JK.
- Since Q is the midpoint of JK, JQ = QK.
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.
- The sum of arcs JL and LK equals arc JKL, so Arc(JL) + Arc(LK) = Arc(JKL).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MM = 6, which is the diameter of circle P. Thus, the radius of circle P is 3.
- JK = 10, so since Q is the midpoint, JQ = QK = 5.
- The measure of arc JKL is 134 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of arc JL.
- We know the measure of arc JKL, which is the sum of arcs JL and LK.
- If we find the measure of arc LK, we can subtract it from the measure of arc JKL to find the measure of arc JL.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all the shapes, points, and lines.
- Capture all given measurements.
- Identify relationships between chords, arcs, and circle.
- Define the right angle and perpendicular lines.
- Specify that MM is a diameter and JK is a chord.
- Define that Q is the midpoint of JK.
- State the length of JK.
- State the length of MM.
- State the measure of Arc(JKL).
- Arc(JKL) = Arc(JL) + Arc(LK)
