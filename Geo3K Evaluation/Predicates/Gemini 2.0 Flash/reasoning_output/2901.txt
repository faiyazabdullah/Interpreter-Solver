PROBLEM 2901 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle W X Y \cong \triangle W X Z. Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two triangles, WXY and WXZ, sharing a common side WX.
- There's a right angle at vertex X in both triangles, indicating that WX is perpendicular to YZ.
- The length of YX is given as 19.
- The length of XZ is given as 3y + 7.
- The angle YWX is given as (20y + 10) degrees.
- The figure suggests triangle WXY is congruent to triangle WXZ.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since WX is perpendicular to YZ, angle WXY and angle WXZ are right angles and congruent.
- The problem statement \triangle W X Y \cong \triangle W X Z suggests that the two triangles are congruent.
- By the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence postulate, since WX is a common side, we have WX congruent to WX. If the triangles are congruent, then YX must be equal to XZ.
- The congruence also implies that angle YWX is congruent to angle ZWX.
- Y, X, and Z are collinear.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- YX = 19
- XZ = 3y + 7
- Angle YWX = (20y + 10) degrees
- Since triangles are congruent, YX = XZ

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of y.
- Using the fact that \triangle WXY \cong \triangle WXZ, it follows that YX = XZ. Therefore 19 = 3y + 7.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines and angles.
- State the given lengths YX and XZ.
- State the measure of angle YWX.
- Indicate WX is perpendicular to YZ.
- State the triangle congruence: \triangle WXY \cong \triangle WXZ
- State the relationship YX = XZ that follows from triangle congruence.
