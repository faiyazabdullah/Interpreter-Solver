PROBLEM 2923 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AC is marked as 2 units.
- Side AB is marked as x units.
- Side BC is marked as 5 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at A.
- Sides AC and AB are perpendicular.
- Side BC is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 2 units (given)
- AB = x units (variable to be found)
- BC = 5 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of AB.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem.
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for solving.
