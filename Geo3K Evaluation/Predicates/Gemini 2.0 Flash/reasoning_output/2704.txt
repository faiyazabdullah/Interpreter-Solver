PROBLEM 2704 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. A = 357 in^2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- I can see a point D on line BC.
- Line segment AD is an altitude of triangle ABC, perpendicular to BC.
- The length of BC is 34 inches.
- The length of AD is x inches.
- The area of triangle ABC is 357 square inches.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex D indicating that AD is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a triangle.
- AD is the altitude to the base BC.
- AD is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 34 inches (given)
- AD = x inches (given)
- Area of triangle ABC = 357 square inches (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- This requires using the formula for the area of a triangle: Area = (1/2) * base * height
- Need to establish the relationship between the area, base, and height.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, points, lines, altitude, and measurements.
- Must include the area formula for solving.
