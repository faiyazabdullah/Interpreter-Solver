PROBLEM 2484 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AC is labeled as 'x'.
- Side BC is marked as 38 units.
- Side AB is marked as 42 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 42 units (given)
- BC = 38 units (given)
- AC = x (unknown length)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of side AC, which is represented by 'x'.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem.
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements and relationships using predicates.
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for solving the unknown side length.
