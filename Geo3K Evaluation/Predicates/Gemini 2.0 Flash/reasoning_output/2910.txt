PROBLEM 2910 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- There is a point D on the line BC such that AD is perpendicular to BC
- The length of AD is 36
- The length of DC is x
- The length of BD is 6x
- The length of AC is y
- The length of AB is z
- There are two right triangles: ADC and ADB.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ADC is a right triangle with right angle at D.
- Triangle ADB is a right triangle with right angle at D.
- AD is perpendicular to BC.
- Points B, D, and C are collinear.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(Line(AD)) = 36
- LengthOf(Line(DC)) = x
- LengthOf(Line(BD)) = 6x
- LengthOf(Line(AC)) = y
- LengthOf(Line(AB)) = z

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- The right triangles ADC and ADB share the side AD. We can use the Pythagorean theorem.
- AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2, AC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, points, lines, right angles, measurements, and relationships.
- The Pythagorean theorem can be expressed.
