PROBLEM 2452 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 58, m \angle 2 = 47, and m \angle 3 = 26. Find the measure of \angle 5.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure containing points A, B, C, D, and E.
- There are line segments connecting these points, forming triangle BCE and triangle CDE. Also triangle ABE and triangle ABD
- Line segment AB has an arrow indicating a direction
- Line segment CE has an arrow indicating a direction
- Angle 1 is at vertex A, Angle 2 at vertex B, Angle 3 at vertex B, Angle 4 at vertex C, Angle 5 at vertex E, Angle 6 at vertex E, Angle 7 at vertex E, Angle 8 at vertex C, and Angle 9 at vertex D.
- The measures of angle 1, angle 2 and angle 3 are given as 58, 47 and 26 degrees respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line segment AB is parallel to line segment CE.
- Angle 6 and angle 1 are alternate interior angles and hence congruent.
- The sum of the angles in triangle BCE is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 58
- m \angle 2 = 47
- m \angle 3 = 26
- We need to find the measure of angle 5.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 5.
- We know that angle 1 is congruent to angle 6, thus m \angle 6 = 58.
- The sum of the angles in triangle BCE is 180 degrees, so m \angle 3 + m \angle 4 + m \angle BEC = 180, or m \angle 3 + m \angle 4 + m \angle 5 + m \angle 6 = 180, or 26 + m \angle 4 + m \angle 5 + 58 = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, angles, parallel lines, given measurements.
- Express the relationship between angle 1 and angle 6 (alternate interior angles).
- The goal is to solve for the measure of angle 5.
