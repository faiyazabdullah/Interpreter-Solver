PROBLEM 3001 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the length of \widehat J K. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center C.
- Points J and K lie on the circle.
- Line segment CJ is a radius of the circle.
- Line segment CK is a radius of the circle.
- The length of CK is given as 2 ft.
- Angle JCK is given as 30 degrees.
- I need to find the length of arc JK.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- CJ and CK are radii of the same circle, so they are equal in length.
- Angle JCK is the central angle subtended by arc JK.
- The length of an arc is given by the formula: arc length = (central angle/360) * (2 * pi * radius)

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of the circle = CK = 2 ft.
- Central angle JCK = 30 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of arc JK.
- I need to use the formula for arc length.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and the points on it.
- Specify the length of the radius.
- Specify the measure of the central angle.
- Relate the arc JK to the circle and the central angle.
