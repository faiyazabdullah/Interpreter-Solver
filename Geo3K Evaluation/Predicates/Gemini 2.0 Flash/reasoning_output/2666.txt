PROBLEM 2666 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: E B \parallel D C. Find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ADC with vertices labeled A, D, C
- There is a line segment EB parallel to DC.
- I can see line segments AD, AE, DE, AB, AC, BC
- There are measurements labeled: AD = 4, DE=10, BC = 5, AB = x-2

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line segment EB is parallel to line segment DC.
- Triangle AEB is similar to Triangle ADC by AA similarity postulate.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 4, therefore length of AE = AD + DE = 4+10 = 14
- BC = 5
- AB = x-2
- AC = AB + BC = x -2 + 5 = x+3

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of AB which is defined by x-2.
- Since EB is parallel to DC and triangles AEB and ADC are similar, we can set up a proportion: AE/AD = AB/AC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the points, lines, triangles.
- We need to specify which lines are parallel
- Specify the known lengths.
- Specify the relationship with proportion and similarity.
