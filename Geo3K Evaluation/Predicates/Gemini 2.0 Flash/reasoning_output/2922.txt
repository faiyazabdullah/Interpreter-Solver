PROBLEM 2922 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points A, B, C, and F on its circumference.
- There is a point D outside the circle.
- Line DA is a secant to the circle.
- Line DB is a secant to the circle.
- The following lengths are given: AD = x, AC = 3x, BF = x+2, DF = 8.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The Secant-Secant Power Theorem applies here.
- The theorem states that for two secants drawn from an external point to a circle, the product of the length of one secant segment and its external segment equals the product of the length of the other secant segment and its external segment.
- Therefore, DB * DF = DA * DC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = x
- AC = 3x
- BF = x+2
- DF = 8
- AB + BF = x+2
- DB = DF + BF = 8 + x + 2 = x + 10
- DC = DA + AC = x + 3x = 4x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- We can set up an equation using the Secant-Secant Power Theorem and the given measurements.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need predicates to represent the points, lines, circle, and the lengths of the line segments.
- We also need to express the Secant-Secant Power Theorem.
