PROBLEM 2634 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: X Y and X Z are midsegments of \triangle R S T. Find S T.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T.
- There are points X, Y, Z on the sides of triangle RST.
- Line segment XY is labeled with a length of 7.
- Line segment RT is labeled with a length of 13.
- Angle YXZ is labeled as 124 degrees.
- Line segment XZ and YT appear parallel.
- Line segment XY and ZT appear parallel.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST, Y and X are midpoints of RT and RS, respectively and Z is midpoint of ST.
- Because XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST, quadrilateral XYZT is a parallelogram.
- RY = YT = RT/2 = 13/2 = 6.5 since Y is midpoint of RT.
- RX = XS since X is midpoint of RS.
- Angle YXZ and angle XYT are supplementary angles because XY and ZT are parallel.
- Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal, therefore, angle YTZ = angle YXZ = 124 degrees.
- Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary so angle XYZ = 180 - 124 = 56 degrees.
- XZ = YT = 6.5 and XY = ZT = 7, since opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent.
- XZ is parallel to RY and XY is parallel to ZT because XYZT is a parallelogram.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of XY = 7
- Length of RT = 13
- Measure of angle YXZ = 124 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of ST.
- The problem states that XY and XZ are midsegments of triangle RST.
- This means that X is the midpoint of RS, Y is the midpoint of RT and Z is the midpoint of ST.
- Since XZ is a midsegment, XZ is parallel to RT and LengthOf(XZ) = 0.5 * LengthOf(RT) which is given as lengthOf(XZ) = 6.5
- Since XY is a midsegment, XY is parallel to ST and LengthOf(XY) = 0.5 * LengthOf(ST). We know that LengthOf(XY)=7.
- So, ST = 2*XY = 2*7 = 14.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, midsegments, measurements, and relationships.
- Include parallel relationships.
- Represent the measurements given in the figure.
