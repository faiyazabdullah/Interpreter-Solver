PROBLEM 2537 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle A F B on \odot F with diameter A C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center F.
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on the circle.
- Lines AC and BD intersect at point F, the center of the circle.
- Angle AFB is labeled as 72 degrees.
- Angle AFD is labeled as (4a - 1) degrees.
- Angle ADF is labeled as (2a - 5) degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AC is a diameter of the circle.
- BD is a diameter of the circle.
- Angle AFB and Angle AFD are supplementary if points A, F, and C are collinear.
- Angles on a straight line add up to 180 degrees.
- The sum of angles in triangle AFD is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MeasureOf(Angle(AFB)) = 72
- MeasureOf(Angle(AFD)) = (4a - 1)
- MeasureOf(Angle(ADF)) = (2a - 5)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle AFB. This is given as 72 degrees. However, we can also use the other information to find the value of a.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, angles, and circle.
- Define the relationships of points lying on the circle and lines intersecting at a point.
- Define angle measurements.
- Define supplementary angles AFB and BFC, where A, F, C are collinear.
- Define that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
