PROBLEM 2661 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 24 units
- Side BC is marked as 14 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C
- Point D lies on side AB
- Line segment CD is perpendicular to side AB

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse
- Line CD is an altitude to the hypotenuse AB

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 24 units (given)
- BC = 14 units (given)
- Length of CD is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of CD, the altitude to the hypotenuse
- This requires using the properties of right triangles

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Need to use the formula Area = 1/2 * base * height
- Area can be calculated using sides AC and BC as base and height, also using AB as base and CD as height
