PROBLEM 2616 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- There are three points G, K on the circle.
- There are two lines GJ and KJ tangent to the circle at points H and K respectively.
- JH = 4, KJ = 6, and GH = x.
- The points G, H, and J lie on a line and the points K, J lie on a line.
- The segment HJ is tangent to the circle at point H, and segment KJ is tangent to the circle at point K.
- GJ is a secant line.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- GH and HJ are parts of the line GJ.
- KJ is tangent to circle A at K, so Line(A,K) is perpendicular to Line(K,J).
- HJ is tangent to circle A at H, so Line(A,H) is perpendicular to Line(H,J).
- From the property that tangents from a common point to a circle are equal, we have JH = JK.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JH = 4
- KJ = 6
- GH = x
- These measurements are lengths of line segments.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of GH.
- Since the two tangent segments from an external point to a circle are equal, it must be the case that JH = JK.
- However, JH = 4 and JK = 6. There is a contradiction here. Assuming JK is indeed tangent to the circle at K, there must be a typo. We are assuming that JH and JK are tangents to the circle from the same point, J.
- From the property that tangents from a common point to a circle are equal, we have JH = JK = 4.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, tangent lines, points, and given measurements.
- Also need to represent the fact that tangents from the same point are equal in length.
