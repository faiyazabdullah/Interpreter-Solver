PROBLEM 2772 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \widehat X Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a circle with center C.
- Points X, Z, and W lie on the circle.
- Lines XY and YZ are tangent to the circle at points X and Z, respectively.
- Angle XYZ is given as 68 degrees.
- The measure of arc XWZ is given as 224 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- XY and YZ are tangents to the circle.
- The measure of an intercepted arc is related to the angle formed by the tangents.
- The sum of the measures of a circle's arcs is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle XYZ measures 68 degrees.
- Arc XWZ measures 224 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc XZ.
- The measure of the major arc XWZ plus the measure of the minor arc XZ equals 360 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, tangent lines, and given angle and arc measurements.
- Need to represent the relationship between arcs that make up the circle.
