PROBLEM 2717 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 3 = 43. Find the measure of \angle 11.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two lines, labeled 'c' and 'd', intersected by two transversals labeled 'a' and 'b'.
- Several angles are labeled with numbers 1 through 16.
- Line 'c' passes through points K, P, O, C.
- Line 'd' passes through points G, H, N, I.
- Transversal 'a' passes through points B, P, H, F.
- Transversal 'b' passes through points M, O, N, Q.
- The measure of angle 3 is given as 43 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- We need to find the relationship between angle 3 and angle 11.
- Assuming lines c and d are parallel, angles 3 and 6 are same-side interior angles and therefore supplementary.
- Assuming lines c and d are parallel, angles 6 and 11 are corresponding angles and therefore congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle 3 is given as 43 degrees.
- If lines c and d are parallel, measure of angle 6 is 180-43=137 degrees.
- If lines c and d are parallel, measure of angle 11 is 137 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the measure of angle 11.
- To do so, we need to determine the relationship between angle 3 and angle 11.
- We will need to use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines and angles.
- Note that lines c and d are parallel.
- Angle 3 and angle 6 are same-side interior angles.
- Angle 6 and angle 11 are corresponding angles.
- Measure of angle 3 is 43 degrees.
