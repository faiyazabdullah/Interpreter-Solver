PROBLEM 2589 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side BC has a point D on it
- Line AD is perpendicular to BC
- Side BD is marked as 8 units
- Side CD is marked as 12 units
- Side AB is labeled as x
- Side AC is labeled as z
- Side AD is labeled as y
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex D (for angle ADB)

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Line AD is perpendicular to BC
- Triangles ADB and ADC are also right triangles
- Side BC is the hypotenuse of triangle ABC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BD = 8 units (given)
- CD = 12 units (given)
- AB = x units
- AC = z units
- AD = y units
- BC = BD + CD = 8 + 12 = 20

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x, which is the length of side AB
- Relevant geometric properties are the Pythagorean theorem and similar triangles

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, right angles, measurements, and relationships
- Use Pythagorean theorem for triangles ABC and ADB
- The Pythagorean relationship and known values allows calculation of x
