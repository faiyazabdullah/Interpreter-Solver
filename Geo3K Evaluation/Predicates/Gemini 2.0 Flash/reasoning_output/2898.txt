PROBLEM 2898 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a composite shape made of a rectangle and two semi-circles.
- The rectangle has a height of 3 and a width of 8.
- The two semi-circles each have a radius of 1.5.
- Points A and B are the centers of the two semi-circles.
- Points D, F, E, and C mark the corners of the rectangle.
- There is a right angle indicated by the small square.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two semi-circles combine to form a complete circle.
- The height of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circles.
- The width of the rectangle is 8.
- The radius of the semi-circles is half the height of the rectangle, so 3/2 = 1.5
- The semi-circles are attached to the sides of the rectangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Rectangle width is 8.
- Rectangle height is 3.
- The radius of each semi-circle is 1.5.
- The area of a circle is πr². The area of a rectangle is length*width.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the total area of the composite figure.
- This is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the two semi-circles, which combined form a full circle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the rectangle with its dimensions.
- I need to represent the circles with their radius.
- I need to represent that the total area is the sum of the areas.
