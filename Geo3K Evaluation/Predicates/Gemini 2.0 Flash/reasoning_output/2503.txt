PROBLEM 2503 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded region.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with center D.
- Points B and C are on the circumference of the circle.
- Line segment BC is a diameter of the circle.
- Point E is on the circumference of the circle.
- Triangle BCE is inscribed in the circle.
- Length of CE is given as 5.
- Angle BEC is given as 30 degrees.
- The area of the shaded region is required.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle BCE is inscribed in a semi-circle, therefore Angle BEC is 30 degrees.
- BC is the diameter of the circle.
- The shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of CE = 5
- Angle BEC = 30 degrees
- Need to find the radius of the circle to compute the circle's area
- Need to find the length of BE to calculate the area of the triangle.
- Since BC is the diameter, BDC is a straight line.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- Area of shaded region = Area of the circle - Area of Triangle BCE.
- Area of circle = PI * Radius^2
- Area of triangle = 1/2 * base * height = 1/2 * BE * CE * sin(angle BEC)
- In triangle BCE, sin(30) = BE/BC.
- We can use the Sine rule to find BC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Identify all the shapes and points.
- Identify all the known values.
- Establish the relation between different elements.
- Represent the shaded region.
