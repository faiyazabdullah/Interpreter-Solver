PROBLEM 2631 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that a \parallel b.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two lines, a and b.
- There are two angles marked as (4x+11)° and (8x+1)°.
- There is a line that intersects both a and b, forming the transversal.
- The points of intersection are marked as A and B.
- Points G, B, A, and H lie on the transversal.
- Points D, B, and F lie on line segment a.
- Points E, A, and C lie on line segment b.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The goal is to make lines a and b parallel.
- The given angles (4x+11)° and (8x+1)° are consecutive interior angles with respect to lines a and b and their transversal GH.
- For lines a and b to be parallel, the consecutive interior angles must be supplementary, meaning their sum must equal 180°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 = (4x + 11)°
- Angle 2 = (8x + 1)°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- To find x such that a || b, the condition of supplementary consecutive interior angles must be met.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the lines a and b.
- Represent the points A, B, G, H, D, E, F, and C.
- Represent the angles (4x+11)° and (8x+1)°.
- Express that the sum of the two angles must be equal to 180 for a and b to be parallel.
