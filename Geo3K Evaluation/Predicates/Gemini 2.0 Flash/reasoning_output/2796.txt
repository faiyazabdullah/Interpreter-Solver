PROBLEM 2796 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of m \widehat Y X Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B
- I can see points V, Z, X, Y on the circle
- I can see lines WX, WY, CZ, and AY
- I can see that line WX intersects line WY at point W
- I can see that angle XWY = 49 degrees
- I can see that arc XY measures 96 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points Z, X, Y lie on circle B
- WX and WY are tangent to the circle at X and Y respectively
- Arc XY is intercepted by angle XBY
- Angle XZY is an inscribed angle intercepting arc XY

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle XWY = 49 degrees
- Measure of arc XY = 96 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc YXZ, which is the entire circle minus arc XY

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the circle and points on the circle
- I need to define the measure of arc XY
- I need to define that WX and WY are tangent lines
- I need to define the measure of angle XWY
