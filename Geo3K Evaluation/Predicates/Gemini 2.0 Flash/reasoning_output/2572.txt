PROBLEM 2572 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle M P Q.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a point Q, a point P, a point M, and a point N.
- There is a line segment QP, a line segment PN, a line segment PM, and a line segment MN.
- I can see a triangle PMN with angles at vertices M and N.
- The angle at vertex M is labeled as 56 degrees.
- The angle at vertex N is labeled as 45 degrees.
- The points Q, P, and N are collinear.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The points Q, P, and N form a straight line.
- The sum of angles MPN and MPQ is 180 degrees (linear pair).
- The sum of the angles of triangle PMN is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle M = 56 degrees
- Angle N = 45 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle MPQ.
- First, find the angle MPN using the triangle angle sum.
- Then use the property that angles MPN and MPQ are supplementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points Q, P, M, and N
- Define lines QP, PN, PM, MN
- Define angles MPN, MPQ, PMN, MNP, NMP
- State that Q, P, N are collinear
- State that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180
- State that angles MPN and MPQ are supplementary
