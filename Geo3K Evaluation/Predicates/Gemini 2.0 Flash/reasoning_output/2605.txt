PROBLEM 2605 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m \widehat A C = 160 and m \angle B E C = 38. What is m \angle A E B?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points A, B, C, and E on the circumference.
- There is a point D inside the circle on the line segment EB.
- Line segments AE, EB, and EC are visible.
- The measure of arc AC is given as 160 degrees.
- The measure of angle BEC is given as 38 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle BEC is an inscribed angle subtending arc BC.
- Angle AEB is an inscribed angle.
- Arc AC is a major arc.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of arc AC = 160 degrees.
- The measure of angle BEC = 38 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle AEB.
- We need to find the relationship between the given arc measure, the given angle, and the angle we are trying to find.
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and the points on it.
- Represent the given arc measure and angle measure.
- Represent the inscribed angles.
