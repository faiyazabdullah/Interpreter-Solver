PROBLEM 2757 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 4 p + 15, m \angle 3 = 3 p - 10 and m \angle 4 = 6 r + 5. Find the value of p.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral with vertices A, B, C, D.
- There are lines intersecting at each vertex.
- There are angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4.
- The measures of angles 1, 3 and 4 are given in terms of variables p and r.
- The figure looks like two intersecting lines at each of the points A, B, C and D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angles 1 and 3 are vertically opposite angles and therefore equal.
- Angles 2 and 4 are vertically opposite angles and therefore equal.
- Each vertex is formed by the intersection of two lines.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 4 p + 15
- m \angle 3 = 3 p - 10
- m \angle 4 = 6 r + 5

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of p.
- Since angles 1 and 3 are vertically opposite, their measures are equal.
- We can set up an equation 4p + 15 = 3p - 10 and solve for p.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the angles and their measures.
- Need to represent the equality between angles 1 and 3.
