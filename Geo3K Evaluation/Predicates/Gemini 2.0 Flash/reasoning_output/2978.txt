PROBLEM 2978 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot P, m \angle M P L = 65 and N P \perp P L. Find m \widehat N M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center P
- Points K, J, L, N, M lie on the circle
- Lines KP, JP, LP, NP, MP are visible
- Angle MPL is labeled as 65 degrees
- There is a right angle symbol at angle NPL

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- P is the center of the circle
- KP, JP, LP, NP, MP are radii of the circle
- NP is perpendicular to PL
- Arc NM is part of the circle

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠MPL = 65 degrees
- m∠NPL = 90 degrees because NP is perpendicular to PL

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc NM
- The measure of arc NM is equal to the measure of central angle NPM
- Angle NPM can be found by subtracting angle MPL from angle NPL

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define circle, points, lines, angles and their relationships
- Need to define perpendicularity and the given angle measures
- Relate central angle to arc measure.
