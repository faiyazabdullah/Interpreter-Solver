PROBLEM 2742 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three points labeled A, B, and C
- There is a point D on the line segment AC
- I can see three line segments: AB, BC, and AC
- Line segment BD is perpendicular to AC
- Length of AD is 8.8
- Length of CD is x
- Length of BC is 8.5
- Length of BD is y
- Length of AB is z
- Angle B is a right angle
- Angle D in triangle BDA and BDC is a right angle

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle
- Triangle BDA and BDC are right triangles.
- BD is the altitude to the hypotenuse AC in triangle ABC.
- Triangles ABC, ADB, and BDC are similar.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 8.8
- CD = x
- BC = 8.5
- BD = y
- AB = z

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of y, which is the length of BD.
- I can use the fact that triangles ADB and BDC are similar.
- Also, I know that BC = 8.5

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- I need to state that angle B is a right angle and angles at D are right angles.
- I need to specify the given lengths.
- I need to state that triangles ADB and BDC are similar.
