PROBLEM 2485 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In rhombus A B C D, A B = 2 x + 3 and B C = 5 x. Find m \angle A E B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD.
- The quadrilateral is labeled as a rhombus.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.
- Side AB is labeled as 2x + 3.
- Side BC is labeled as 5x.
- Angle AEB appears to be a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rhombus, so all sides are congruent.
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
- Since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, angle AEB is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2x + 3
- BC = 5x
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, AB = BC.
- The measure of angle AEB is what the question is asking for.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle AEB.
- Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, angle AEB is a right angle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the rhombus ABCD and the intersection point E.
- We need to specify the relationship between sides AB and BC.
- We also need to represent that angle AEB is a right angle.
