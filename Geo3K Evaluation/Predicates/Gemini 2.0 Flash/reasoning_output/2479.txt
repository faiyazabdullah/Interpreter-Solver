PROBLEM 2479 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The two polygons are similar. Find U T.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two pentagons: RSTUV and ABCDE.
- Pentagon RSTUV has vertices R, S, T, U, and V.
- Pentagon ABCDE has vertices A, B, C, D, and E.
- The sides ST, TU, RV are labeled with lengths 18 m, (y+2) m, and x m, respectively.
- The sides AB, BC, ED are labeled with lengths 3 m, 4 m, and 5 m, respectively.
- All angles in both pentagons are marked with the same arc symbol, indicating they are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two pentagons are stated to be similar.
- Since the pentagons are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.
- Angles R, S, T, U, and V are congruent to angles A, B, C, D, and E, respectively.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of ST = 18 m
- Length of TU = (y + 2) m
- Length of RV = x m
- Length of AB = 3 m
- Length of BC = 4 m
- Length of ED = 5 m

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of TU, which is represented by the expression (y + 2) m.
- Since the pentagons are similar, we can set up proportions between corresponding sides to solve for y.
- ST corresponds to AB, TU corresponds to BC, and UV corresponds to CD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the two pentagons, their similarity, and their side lengths.
- Need to define the proportions based on the corresponding sides.
- Need to represent TU as (y+2).
