PROBLEM 2902 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of J K.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with points J, K, L, and N.
- There are line segments JK, JL, KL, and JN.
- Point N lies on line segment KL.
- Angle JNL is a right angle.
- Segments KN and NL are congruent.
- Segment JK is labeled 6x + 7.
- Segment JL is labeled 9x - 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line segment JN is perpendicular to line segment KL.
- Point N is the midpoint of line segment KL, since KN is congruent to NL.
- Therefore, JN is the perpendicular bisector of KL.
- This means that J is equidistant from K and L.
- Thus, JK = JL.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 6x + 7
- JL = 9x - 5
- KN = NL

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of JK.
- Since JK = JL, we can set up the equation 6x + 7 = 9x - 5 to solve for x.
- Once x is found, we can substitute it back into the expression for JK to find its measure.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and line segments.
- State that N is the midpoint of KL.
- State that JN is perpendicular to KL.
- State that JK = 6x + 7 and JL = 9x - 5.
- State that JK = JL.
