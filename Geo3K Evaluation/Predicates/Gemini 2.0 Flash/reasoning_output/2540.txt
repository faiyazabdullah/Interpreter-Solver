PROBLEM 2540 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 3 if A B \perp B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, E, and F
- I can see lines AD, AE, BC, BF, DC
- I can see angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- I can see the angle measures 36°, 104°, 40°
- I can see a right angle symbol at angle 5, which indicates that line segments AB and BC are perpendicular

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle 1 and the 104° angle are supplementary
- Angle 3 and the 104° angle form a straight line.
- AB is perpendicular to BC.
- Angle 5 is a right angle.
- Angle 7 and the 40° angle are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle D measures 36 degrees
- Angle formed by segments DC at point O measures 104 degrees
- Angle EFC measures 40 degrees
- Angle 5 measures 90 degrees because it is indicated as a right angle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 3, given that AB is perpendicular to BC.
- Since angle 5 is 90 degrees because of the perpendicularity, and angle 3 and angle 5 are adjacent, there is a direct relationship between them. Angle 3 and angle 1 are supplementary to the 104° angle, respectively. Angle 5 = 90°, meaning line AB is perpendicular to line BC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent all points, lines, and angle measurements
- Need to represent perpendicularity of AB and BC.
- Need to represent supplementary angles.
