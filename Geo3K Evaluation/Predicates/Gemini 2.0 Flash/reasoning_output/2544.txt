PROBLEM 2544 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle K L M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral JKLM with vertices labeled J, K, L, M.
- Angle at vertex K is marked as 109 degrees.
- Side LM is marked as 6 units.
- The figure appears to be a parallelogram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral JKLM is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel.
- Opposite angles of a parallelogram are congruent.
- Consecutive angles of a parallelogram are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- mâˆ JKL = 109 degrees
- LengthOf(Line(L,M)) = 6 units

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle KLM.
- Angle KLM is a consecutive angle to angle JKL in the parallelogram.
- Therefore, the two angles are supplementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram, points, lines, angles, and given measurements.
- Represent the relationship between consecutive angles in a parallelogram being supplementary.
