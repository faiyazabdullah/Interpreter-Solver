PROBLEM 2948 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, A D is perpendicular to B C and A B is perpendicular to A C. What is B C?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with points labeled A, B, C.
- There is a line segment AD that is perpendicular to BC.
- There is a right angle at A where AB is perpendicular to AC
- There is a segment BD which has a length of 5
- There is a segment AB which has a length of 10

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A.
- Line AD is perpendicular to BC.
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle.
- Triangle ADC is a right triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BD = 5 units (given)
- AB = 10 units (given)
- Angle BAC is a right angle.
- Angle ADB is a right angle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BC.
- This requires finding the length of DC.
- Using similar triangles, or geometric mean theorem can help find the missing length.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, right angles, measurements, and perpendicular lines.
- Need to establish the relationship between similar triangles, or the geometric mean.
