PROBLEM 2745 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A B C D is a parallelogram with side lengths as indicated in the figure at the right. The perimeter of A B C D is 22. Find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side AB is labeled as 2y + 1
- Side BC is labeled as x - w + 1
- Side CD is labeled as 3 - 4w
- Side DA is labeled as 3x - 2
- The quadrilateral is stated to be a parallelogram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length
- AB = CD and BC = DA

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2y + 1
- BC = x - w + 1
- CD = 3 - 4w
- DA = 3x - 2
- Perimeter of ABCD is 22

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AB
- This requires finding the value of y
- We need to set up equations based on the properties of a parallelogram and the perimeter.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram, its sides, and their lengths
- Represent the equality of opposite sides
- Represent the perimeter as the sum of all sides
- No Find() predicate
