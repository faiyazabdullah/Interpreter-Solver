PROBLEM 2854 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find h in the triangle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- The hypotenuse AB is labeled as 'h'
- Side BC is marked as 4 units
- Angle ABC is labeled as 60 degrees
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.
- Side BC is opposite to angle A.
- Angle ABC and BAC are complementary (sum to 90 degrees).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 4 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 60 degrees (given)
- AB = h, which is what the question asks to find.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of the hypotenuse AB, labeled 'h'.
- We have the length of the side BC, which is opposite to the 60 degree angle at B.
- We can use trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) to relate the angle and the sides.
- Since we have the opposite side (BC) and want to find the hypotenuse (AB), we can use the sine function: sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Include the sine relationship to relate the angle, opposite side, and hypotenuse.
