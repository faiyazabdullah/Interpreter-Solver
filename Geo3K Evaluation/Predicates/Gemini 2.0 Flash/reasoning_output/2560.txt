PROBLEM 2560 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points R, S, T, and U on the circle.
- There are two chords intersecting at point V inside the circle.
- The length of RV is 4.
- The length of VU is 8.
- The length of TV is 4.
- The length of VS is x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Chords RT and SU intersect at V.
- According to the intersecting chords theorem, RV * VU = SV * VT.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RV = 4
- VU = 8
- TV = 4
- VS = x (unknown)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x (VS).
- Use the intersecting chords theorem.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, line segments, and lengths.
- Express the intersecting chords theorem.
