PROBLEM 2724 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle L M N \cong \triangle Q R S. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, LMN and QRS.
- The sides and one angle of triangle LMN are labeled as 2x+11, y+10.
- The sides and one angle of triangle QRS are labeled as 3x-9, 2y-40.
- The problem states that \triangle L M N \cong \triangle Q R S.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two triangles are congruent, which means their corresponding sides and angles are equal.
- I need to match the corresponding parts of the two triangles.
- LM corresponds to QR, so LengthOf(Line(L,M)) = LengthOf(Line(Q,R)).
- Angle M corresponds to Angle R, so MeasureOf(Angle(M)) = MeasureOf(Angle(R)).
- LN corresponds to QS

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(Line(L,M)) = 2x + 11
- LengthOf(Line(Q,R)) = 3x - 9
- MeasureOf(Angle(M)) = y + 10
- MeasureOf(Angle(R)) = 2y - 40

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x.
- Because of congruence, I know that 2x + 11 = 3x - 9 and y + 10 = 2y - 40.
- I can solve for x using the equation 2x + 11 = 3x - 9.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the triangles, their sides and angles.
- I need to establish the congruence relationship.
- I need to state the equality of corresponding parts.
