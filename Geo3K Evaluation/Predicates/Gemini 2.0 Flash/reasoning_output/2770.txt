PROBLEM 2770 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle A.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Angle A is labeled as x degrees.
- Angle B is labeled as 2x degrees.
- Angle C is labeled as 2x degrees.
- Angle D is labeled as x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid because angles A and D are equal, and angles B and C are equal, implying that sides BC and AD are parallel.
- Angles A and B are same-side interior angles and supplementary
- Angles C and D are same-side interior angles and supplementary

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle A = x degrees
- m \angle B = 2x degrees
- m \angle C = 2x degrees
- m \angle D = x degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of m \angle A, which is x.
- Since ABCD is a trapezoid, we know that the sum of the angles is 360 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define quadrilateral ABCD
- Define angles A, B, C, and D
- Define measurements of the angles in terms of x
- Express the sum of the angles as 360 degrees.
- Indicate that angles B and C are equal.
- Indicate that angles A and D are equal.
- State the supplementary angle relationships.
- State that AB and CD are legs of the trapezoid and that BC and AD are bases.
