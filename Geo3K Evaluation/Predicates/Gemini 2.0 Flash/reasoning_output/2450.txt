PROBLEM 2450 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix, on to Atlanta, and back to Des Moines, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- The side lengths are given as expressions of x:
  - AB = 150x + 91
  - BC = 110x + 53
  - CA = 73.8x
- The triangle vertices are labeled as follows:
  - A = Atlanta
  - B = Phoenix
  - C = Des Moines

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- There is a triangle formed by connecting Atlanta, Phoenix, and Des Moines.
- The lengths of the sides are given in terms of a variable x.
- The problem states that the total trip (perimeter of the triangle) is 3482 miles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 150x + 91
- BC = 110x + 53
- CA = 73.8x
- Perimeter = 3482

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The problem asks for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which is the length of side AB.
- We need to find the value of x using the given perimeter and then substitute it into the expression for AB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the triangle, the side lengths, and the perimeter.
- I need to represent the relationship between the sides and the perimeter: AB + BC + CA = Perimeter
- I also need to represent the known perimeter value.
