PROBLEM 2727 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle Z to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, Z.
- Side XY is marked as 5 units.
- Side XZ is marked as 9 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex Y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is a right triangle with a right angle at Y.
- Sides XY and YZ are perpendicular.
- Side XZ is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XY = 5 units (given).
- XZ = 9 units (given).
- The question is asking for the measure of angle Z.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle Z.
- I can use trigonometric relationships (sine, cosine, tangent) to solve this problem.
- Since I know the lengths of the opposite side (XY) and hypotenuse (XZ) with respect to angle Z, I can use the sine function.
- sin(Z) = opposite/hypotenuse = XY/XZ = 5/9
- Z = arcsin(5/9)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and trigonometric relationships.
