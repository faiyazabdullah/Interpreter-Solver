PROBLEM 2680 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 4.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle.
- I can see two secant lines intersecting inside the circle at point F.
- The secant lines intersect the circle at points R, U, S, and T.
- The angle formed by arc RU is labeled as 92 degrees.
- The angle formed by arc ST is labeled as 51 degrees.
- The intersection point of the secants inside the circle is labeled as F.
- The angle labeled is 4 is formed by the secant lines.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The angle 4 is formed by the intersection of two secant lines inside a circle.
- The measure of angle 4 is equal to half the sum of the intercepted arcs.
- The intercepted arcs are RU and ST.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of arc RU = 92 degrees.
- Measure of arc ST = 51 degrees.
- Measure of angle 4 = (1/2) * (measure of arc RU + measure of arc ST).

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 4.
- I can use the intercepted arcs RU and ST to determine the measure of angle 4.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the circle, the points, the lines, and the arcs.
- I need to specify the measures of the arcs RU and ST.
- I need to represent the relationship between angle 4 and the arcs RU and ST.
