PROBLEM 2828 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle J K L \sim \triangle W Y Z. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify two triangles: Triangle JKL and Triangle WYZ
- In triangle JKL, angle J is labeled as (4x-13)°, and angle K is labeled as y°.
- In triangle WYZ, angle W is labeled as 71°, and angle Z is labeled as 44°.
- The problem states that the two triangles are similar.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are congruent.
- This means Angle J is congruent to Angle W, Angle K is congruent to Angle Y, and Angle L is congruent to Angle Z.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠J = (4x-13)°
- m∠K = y°
- m∠W = 71°
- m∠Z = 44°
- Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, we can calculate the measure of angle Y.
- m∠Y = 180 - (71 + 44) = 180 - 115 = 65°
- Therefore, m∠K = y = 65°.
- Also, m∠L = 44° because it's congruent to angle Z.
- Since Angle J is congruent to Angle W, their measures are equal.
- Thus, (4x-13) = 71

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Since the triangles are similar, Angle J = Angle W
- Set up the equation (4x-13) = 71 and solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangles and their angles
- State the similarity between the two triangles
- Equate the corresponding angles since the triangles are similar
- State the measures of the given angles
