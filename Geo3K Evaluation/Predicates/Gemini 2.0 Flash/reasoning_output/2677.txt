PROBLEM 2677 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The perimeter of this polygon is 60 centimeters. Find the length of the side of the polygon.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a pentagon labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
- Each side of the pentagon is marked with a congruence mark.
- The perimeter of the pentagon is stated to be 60 centimeters.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The pentagon is equilateral, meaning all sides are congruent.
- The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Perimeter of the pentagon = 60 cm.
- Since all sides are congruent, each side has the same length.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of a side of the pentagon.
- We know that the perimeter is 60 cm, and there are 5 equal sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the pentagon, its vertices, and its equilateral property.
- Need to state the perimeter.
- Need to express the equality of the side lengths.
