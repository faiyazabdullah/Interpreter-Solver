PROBLEM 2541 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle A of quadrilateral A B C D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Angle A is labeled as 3x degrees.
- Angle D is labeled as x degrees.
- There are right angle symbols at vertex B and vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angles B and C are right angles, meaning they measure 90 degrees each.
- The quadrilateral is a trapezoid because sides AB and CD form right angles with side BC and are, therefore, parallel.
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle A = 3x degrees
- Angle B = 90 degrees
- Angle C = 90 degrees
- Angle D = x degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle A.
- I need to find the value of x, then multiply it by 3.
- Using the property that the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees, I can write the equation: 3x + 90 + 90 + x = 360

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the quadrilateral ABCD.
- Define points A, B, C, D.
- Define angles A, B, C, D.
- State that angles B and C are right angles.
- Represent the measurements of the angles in terms of x.
- State that the sum of the angles of quadrilateral ABCD is 360 degrees.
