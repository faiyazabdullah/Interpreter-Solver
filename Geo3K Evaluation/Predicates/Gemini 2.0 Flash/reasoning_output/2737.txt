PROBLEM 2737 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is labeled as x
- Side BC is marked as 13 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B
- Angle ACB is labeled as 52 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular
- Angle ACB is an acute angle

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = x (unknown)
- BC = 13 units (given)
- Angle ACB = 52 degrees (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AB, which is x
- Since we have the length of side BC and angle ACB, we can use the tangent trigonometric function.
- Tan(Angle ACB) = Opposite/Adjacent = AB/BC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include the tangent relationship for solving.
