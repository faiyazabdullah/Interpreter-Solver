PROBLEM 2999 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The square is circumscribed to the circle. Find the exact circumference of the circle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a square with vertices labeled A, C, F, and D.
- I can see a circle with center labeled H.
- The circle is inside the square.
- The circle is tangent to the sides of the square at points E, I, M, and G.
- Segments AD and DF are perpendicular, as are segments DF and FC, and segments FC and CA, and segments CA and AD.
- The length of DF is labeled as 14 yd.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The square is circumscribed to the circle, meaning the circle is tangent to all four sides of the square.
- Since DF is a side of the square, all sides of the square have a length of 14 yd.
- Since the circle is tangent to the sides of the square, the diameter of the circle is equal to the side length of the square, which is 14 yd.
- The radius of the circle is half the diameter.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of DF = 14 yd.
- Diameter of the circle = Length of DF = 14 yd.
- The question is asking for the circumference of the circle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the exact circumference of the circle.
- The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula: Circumference = pi * diameter.
- The diameter of the circle is equal to the side of the square.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the square, circle, points, and tangency.
- Need to represent the relationship between the diameter and the side of the square.
- Need to define the relationship between circumference and diameter.
