PROBLEM 2445 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ADE, with vertices labeled A, D, and E.
- I can see a line AG which is perpendicular to line DE.
- I can see angles: Angle(DAE) = 30 degrees, Angle(AED) = 45 degrees, Angle(DGA) = 90 degrees.
- I can see lengths: LengthOf(AE) = 8, LengthOf(AG) = x, LengthOf(DG) = y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ADE is a triangle.
- Angle DGA is a right angle, so Line(AG) is perpendicular to Line(DE).
- Triangle AEG is a triangle.
- Triangle ADG is a triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AE is 8.
- Angle AED is 45 degrees.
- Angle ADE is 30 degrees.
- Length of AG is x.
- Length of DG is y.
- Angle DGA is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AG, which is x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- Define the measurements of the angles and the length of AE.
- Define the perpendicular relationship.
