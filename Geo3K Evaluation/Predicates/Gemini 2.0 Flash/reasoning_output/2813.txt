PROBLEM 2813 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find D E.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, Triangle ABE and Triangle CDE
- Points A, B, C, D, and E are labeled
- Side AB has a length of 2
- Side AE has a length of x - 1
- Side CD has a length of 5
- Side DE has a length of x + 5

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle AEB and Angle CED are vertical angles, therefore they are congruent.
- Angle BAE and Angle DCE are alternate interior angles
- If Angle BAE is congruent to Angle DCE then AB is parallel to CD
- If AB is parallel to CD, then Triangle ABE is similar to Triangle CDE by the AA similarity postulate

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2
- AE = x - 1
- CD = 5
- DE = x + 5

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of DE, which is x + 5. To find DE, we must find the value of x
- Because we suspect that Triangle ABE is similar to Triangle CDE, we can set up a proportion to solve for x

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles, and triangles
- Express similarity of triangles ABE and CDE
- Set up the ratios between corresponding sides using the given lengths
- Use the similarity to set up a proportion
