PROBLEM 2823 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The segment is tangent to the circle. Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center T.
- Point U lies on the circle.
- Point V is outside the circle.
- Line VU is tangent to the circle at point U.
- Line VT intersects the circle at point B.
- The length of VB is 7.
- The length of BT is 11.
- The length of TU is x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since VU is tangent to the circle at U, TU is a radius and VU is tangent, then angle TUT is a right angle.
- TB is a radius and the length of TB is equal to the length of TU.
- Line VT is a secant.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- VB = 7
- BT = 11
- TU = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find x, which is the length of the radius TU.
- Apply the tangent-secant power theorem: (VU)^2 = VB * VT

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, and their relationships.
- Represent the lengths of the line segments.
- Represent the tangent-secant theorem.
- Represent that TB = TU, since they are both radii of the same circle.
- Express VT as VB + BT.
