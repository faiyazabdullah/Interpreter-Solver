PROBLEM 2986 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- I can see a point S outside the circle.
- I can see two lines from point S that intersect the circle.
- Line SR is tangent to the circle at point R.
- Line SU intersects the circle at points T and U.
- Length of ST is 5.
- Length of SR is 9.
- Length of TU is x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- SR is tangent to the circle.
- STU is a secant to the circle.
- The tangent-secant power theorem applies here.
- The theorem states that ST * SU = SR^2
- We know ST = 5, SR = 9.
- SU = ST + TU = 5 + x.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ST = 5
- SR = 9
- TU = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of x.
- We can use the tangent-secant power theorem.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points S, T, U, R, A and Circle A
- Define lines SR, ST, SU
- Define Tangent(Line(S,R), Circle(A))
- Define Secant(Line(S,U), Circle(A))
- LengthOf(Line(S,T)) = 5
- LengthOf(Line(S,R)) = 9
- LengthOf(Line(T,U)) = x
- Establish relationship using tangent-secant theorem: ST * SU = SR^2 which can be written as LengthOf(Line(S,T)) * LengthOf(Line(S,U)) = SquareOf(LengthOf(Line(S,R)))
