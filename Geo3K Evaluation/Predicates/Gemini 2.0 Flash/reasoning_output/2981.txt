PROBLEM 2981 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the rhombus.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rhombus labeled ABCD.
- The height of the rhombus is shown as 12 mm. This is the perpendicular distance between sides AD and BC.
- The length of the base is shown as 22 mm. This is the length of side AD.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Rhombus ABCD has sides AD and BC that can be considered bases.
- The height given is the perpendicular distance between the two bases.
- The area of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: Area = base * height.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of the base AD is 22 mm.
- The height of the rhombus is 12 mm.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- This requires multiplying the base and the height.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, the base, the height and their respective lengths.
