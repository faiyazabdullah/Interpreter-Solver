PROBLEM 2564 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle BCDE.
- Inside the rectangle there are two circles.
- The centers of the two circles are labeled A and H.
- The length of the rectangle is given as 10 cm.
- The width of the rectangle is given as 5 cm.
- The circles are tangent to each other.
- The circles are tangent to the rectangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- BCDE is a rectangle, meaning angles at B, C, D, and E are right angles and opposite sides are equal.
- The circles are congruent because they have the same diameter, which is equal to the width of the rectangle.
- The diameter of each circle is 5 cm.
- The radius of each circle is 2.5 cm.
- The distance between the centers A and H is the sum of the radii, which is 5 cm.
- The shaded area is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the two circles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BCDE = 10 cm
- Width of BCDE = 5 cm
- Diameter of each circle = 5 cm
- Radius of each circle = 2.5 cm

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- The area of the shaded region can be found by subtracting the area of the two circles from the area of the rectangle.
- Area of rectangle = length * width
- Area of each circle = pi * radius^2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define rectangle BCDE and its properties.
- Define the two circles and their radii.
- Define the shaded region.
- Relate the areas of the rectangle, circles, and shaded region.
- Provide the given measurements.
