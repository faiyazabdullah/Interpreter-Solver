PROBLEM 2976 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a diagram with points labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- There is a line segment CE which also forms a line.
- There are triangles: ADF and ABF
- Angle CAB is 22 degrees, Angle ACB is 23 degrees, Angle ADB is 32 degrees
- Angles 1, 2 and 3 are labeled. Angle 3 is an exterior angle of triangle ABF.
- The points C, F, B, and E are collinear and lie on a line.
- There are three angles at point B labeled 2 and 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle 3 is an exterior angle to triangle ABF and is supplementary to angle 2.
- Angle 1 and angle AFB are vertically opposite angles, and hence equal.
- The sum of the angles in triangle ADF is 180 degrees.
- The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.
- Angle 3 is an exterior angle of triangle ABF. Therefore, angle 3 = angle BAF + angle AFB = 22 + angle AFB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle CAB = 22 degrees
- Measure of angle ACB = 23 degrees
- Measure of angle ADB = 32 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We want to find the measure of angle 2.
- We know that angles 2 and 3 are supplementary, so angle 2 + angle 3 = 180.
- We can determine the measure of angle AFB and thus angle 1. With that, we can find the measure of angle 3 and, from that, angle 2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, angles, and shapes.
- Include the given measurements of the angles.
- Represent the fact that points C, F, B, and E are collinear.
- Show that angle 1 and angle AFB are equal because they are vertically opposite.
- Represent angle 3 as an exterior angle to triangle ABF and supplementary to angle 2.
- Capture all angular relationships.
