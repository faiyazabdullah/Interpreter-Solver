PROBLEM 2625 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle. If m \angle E F D = 2 x - 3 and m \angle D F G = x + 12, find m \angle E F D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral D E F G with vertices labeled D, E, F, G.
- The quadrilateral is a rectangle.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex G.
- There are two diagonals: DF and EG. They intersect at point A.
- Angle EFD is labeled as 2x - 3.
- Angle DFG is labeled as x + 12.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle, meaning all its angles are right angles.
- Angle DFG is a part of right angle GFE.
- m \angle EFD + m \angle DFG = 90 because they form angle EFG, which is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle EFD = 2x - 3
- m \angle DFG = x + 12
- m \angle EFG = 90

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle EFD.
- Need to use the relationship: m \angle EFD + m \angle DFG = 90.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle, angles, measurements, and their relationship (summing to 90 degrees).
