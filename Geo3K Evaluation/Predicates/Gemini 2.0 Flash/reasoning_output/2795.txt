PROBLEM 2795 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z
- The angles are labeled as follows:
  - Angle W: (1/2 * a + 8) degrees
  - Angle X: a degrees
  - Angle Y: (a - 28) degrees
  - Angle Z: (a + 2) degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
- Therefore, the sum of angles W, X, Y, and Z equals 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠W = (1/2 * a + 8)
- m∠X = a
- m∠Y = (a - 28)
- m∠Z = (a + 2)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle Z (m∠Z).
- To find this, we need to first determine the value of 'a'.
- The sum of the angles in the quadrilateral will allow us to find 'a'.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and quadrilateral.
- Define the angle measurements.
- State that the sum of the interior angles equals 360.
