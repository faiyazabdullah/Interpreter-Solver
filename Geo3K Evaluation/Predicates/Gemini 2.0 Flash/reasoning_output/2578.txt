PROBLEM 2578 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth, if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a circle.
- Points A, B, C, and G lie on the circle.
- Lines DB and DC are tangent to the circle at points B and C, respectively.
- Line DAG is a secant to the circle.
- Line EGC is a chord of the circle.
- The length of DB is labeled as x.
- The length of DA is labeled as 9.
- The length of AB is labeled as 24.
- The length of EC is labeled as 12.25.
- The length of AG is labeled as y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- DB and DC are tangents from the same external point D to the circle, so DB = DC.
- DAG is a secant, and AB and AG are segments of the secant.
- By the tangent-secant power theorem, the square of the tangent (DB) is equal to the product of the external part of the secant (DA) and the whole secant (DA + AB).  DB^2 = DA * (DA + AB).
- Since EGC is a chord, we know that length of AG is y.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(DB) = x
- LengthOf(DA) = 9
- LengthOf(AB) = 24
- LengthOf(EC) = 12.25
- By the tangent-secant theorem, x^2 = 9 * (9 + 24)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- I need to use the tangent-secant power theorem to set up an equation.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle, points, lines, tangent, secant.
- Record known lengths.
- Apply tangent-secant theorem in terms of the variables.
- The predicates must provide enough information to calculate x.
