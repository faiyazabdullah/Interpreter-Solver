PROBLEM 2983 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Cut four congruent triangles off the corners of a rectangle to make an octagon. What is the area of the octagon?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle with four congruent right triangles cut off at each corner.
- The resulting shape is an octagon.
- The rectangle has a width of 30 cm and a height of 20 cm.
- The legs of each right triangle are both 6 cm.
- The vertices of the rectangle are B, C, D, and F. The vertices of the octagon are G, L, J, K, A, I, H, and M.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The four triangles are congruent and right triangles.
- The sides of length 6 cm are perpendicular.
- The rectangle has right angles at each vertex.
- The area of the octagon is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the four triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Width of the rectangle: 30 cm
- Height of the rectangle: 20 cm
- Legs of the right triangles: 6 cm
- Area of each right triangle: (1/2) * 6 cm * 6 cm = 18 sq cm
- Area of the four right triangles: 4 * 18 sq cm = 72 sq cm
- Area of the rectangle: 30 cm * 20 cm = 600 sq cm

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the octagon.
- This is equal to the area of the rectangle minus the area of the four triangles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the rectangle and the four congruent right triangles.
- Need to define the lengths of the sides of the rectangle and the legs of the triangles.
- Need to define the area of the rectangle.
- Need to define the area of each triangle.
- Need to express that the four triangles are congruent.
