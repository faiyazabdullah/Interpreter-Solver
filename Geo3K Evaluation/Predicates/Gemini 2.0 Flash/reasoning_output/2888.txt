PROBLEM 2888 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two triangles are shown, Triangle(EFG) and Triangle(ABC)
- Points are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
- Length of AD is 10
- Length of GH is x
- Length of DC is 15
- Length of HB is marked congruent to length of DC
- Length of FG is 12
- Length of BH is marked congruent to length of FG
- Angle F is marked congruent to Angle C
- Angle H is marked congruent to Angle B
- BD = HB + DC

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle EFG is similar to triangle ADC. Since angle F is congruent to angle C, and angle H is congruent to angle B.
- FG is congruent to HB
- DC is congruent to HB
- AD = 10, DC = 15, FG = 12
- BH = DC = 15
- Since triangle EFG is similar to triangle ADC, we have the ratio x/10 = 12/15

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 10, DC = 15, FG = 12, GH = x
- HB = DC = 15
- Two sides and one angle congruent, therefore the triangles are similar

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find x
- Since the triangles are similar, we have x/AD = FG/DC. Therefore, x/10 = 12/15. Then, x = (12*10)/15

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, triangles, and congruency of angles and sides
- Setup the relationship between the sides
- Use similar triangles property to deduce ratios
