PROBLEM 2744 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle A B C if m \angle C D A = 61.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD.
- Triangle ABD is present.
- Triangle BCD is present.
- Angle BAC is labeled as 69 degrees.
- Angle DBC is labeled as 55 degrees.
- Angle ACB is a right angle.
- Angle ABC is labeled as x.
- Angle CDA is labelled as 61 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.
- Angles ABC and BAC are part of triangle ABC.
- Angles DBC and BCD are part of triangle DBC.
- The sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle BAC = 69 degrees.
- Angle DBC = 55 degrees.
- Angle ACB = 90 degrees.
- Angle CDA = 61 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle ABC, which is x.
- Angle ABC is part of right triangle ABC.
- The sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180.
- We are given that angle BAC is 69, and angle ACB is 90.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, right angle, angle measurements, and relationships.
- Sum of angles of a triangle.
- We can then say x + 69 + 90 = 180
