PROBLEM 2706 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see parallel lines: OL, FC, and MN. Also, DI is parallel to GBK.
- Points are labeled: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P
- Line segments BH and AE are marked as congruent.
- Angle measurements are given as 2x+3, 6-x, (4/3)y+1, and 2y.
- I need to find the value of x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since OL, FC, and MN are parallel, the transversal GBK creates corresponding angles that are equal.
- Angle OBH is corresponding to angle HAE, and these are congruent.
- The measurements are related since they are corresponding angles and the lines are parallel.
- BH is congruent to AE.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle OBH is given as 2x+3.
- Angle MAE is given as 6-x.
- Since OL, FC, and MN are parallel, the distance between them is equal if BH = AE.
- If the distance is equal, the corresponding angles are equal.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x.
- I can set the measurements of angles OBH and MAE equal to each other to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the parallel lines.
- I need to define the transversal.
- I need to represent the corresponding angles.
- I need to state that the corresponding angles are equal.
