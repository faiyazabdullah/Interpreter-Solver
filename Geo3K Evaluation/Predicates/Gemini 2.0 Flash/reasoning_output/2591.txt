PROBLEM 2591 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A regular pentagon and a square share a mutual vertex X. The sides X Y and X Z are sides of a third regular polygon with a vertex at X. How many sides does this polygon have?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a regular pentagon ABCDZ and a square BCYX that share vertex X.
- XY and XZ are sides of another regular polygon.
- Points are labeled A, B, C, D, X, Y, Z.
- Lines are visible connecting the points.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCDZ is a regular pentagon, so all its sides are congruent and all its interior angles are congruent.
- BCYX is a square, so all its sides are congruent and all its interior angles are right angles.
- XY and XZ are sides of a regular polygon that has vertex X.
- Angle YXC and angle ZXC form part of the interior angle of that regular polygon.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The interior angle of a regular pentagon is 108 degrees.
- The interior angle of a square is 90 degrees.
- Angle BCD = 108 degrees.
- Angle BCX = 90 degrees.
- Angle BCX + Angle XCD = Angle BCD.
- Side length of square BCYX = Side length of pentagon ABCDZ
- Side length of regular polygon XZ... = Side length of regular polygon XY....

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the number of sides of the regular polygon with sides XY and XZ.
- The measure of the interior angle at vertex X of the regular polygon is needed.
- Angle YXC = 90 degrees.
- The measure of angle BXC = 90 degrees.
- The measure of angle BCX = 90 degrees.
- Angle XCB + Angle XCD = 108. Angle XCD = 108 - 90 = 18 degrees.
- The measure of angle ZXA = 108 degrees.
- Angle ZXC = Angle ZXA - Angle CXA = 108 - Angle CXA.
- Angle CXA = 18 degrees.
- Angle ZXC = 108 - 18 = 90 degrees.
- Therefore, angle ZXY = angle ZXC + angle CXY = 90 + 90 = 180 - (360/n). n = 20.
- Angle ZXA = 108, angle AXB = 108, angle BXC = 90.
- Angle ZXY = 360 - (108+108+90) = 54

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the regular pentagon.
- Need to represent the square.
- Need to represent congruence between sides.
- Need to calculate the angle at X for the unknown polygon.
- Need to represent the number of sides of regular polygons
