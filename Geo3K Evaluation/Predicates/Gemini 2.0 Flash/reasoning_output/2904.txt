PROBLEM 2904 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AC is marked as 5 ft
- Side AB is marked as 12 ft
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AC and AB are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 5 ft (given)
- AB = 12 ft (given)
- BC length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BC
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for solving
