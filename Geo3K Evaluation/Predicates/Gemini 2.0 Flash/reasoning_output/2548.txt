PROBLEM 2548 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral D E F G is a rectangle. If m \angle E D F = 5 x - 3 and m \angle D F G = 3 x + 7, find m \angle E D F.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral DEFG, which appears to be a rectangle.
- The vertices are labeled D, E, F, and G.
- There are lines connecting these vertices, forming the sides of the rectangle.
- There is a point A at the intersection of the diagonals DF and EG.
- A right angle symbol at vertex G indicates that angle DGF is a right angle.
- m \angle EDF = 5x - 3
- m \angle DFG = 3x + 7

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral DEFG is a rectangle.
- Angle DGF is a right angle.
- Since DEFG is a rectangle, all its angles are right angles, and the opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, diagonals are equal.
- The diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other.
- Angle EDF and angle DFG are acute angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle EDF = 5x - 3
- m \angle DFG = 3x + 7
- Since DEFG is a rectangle, angle DGF is a right angle, thus 90 degrees.
- Since DEFG is a rectangle, angle DEF is a right angle, thus 90 degrees.
- Since DEFG is a rectangle, angle EFG is a right angle, thus 90 degrees.
- Since DEFG is a rectangle, angle EDG is a right angle, thus 90 degrees.
- Angle EDF + Angle DFG = 90 since angles EDF and EFG are complementary in a rectangle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m \angle EDF.
- We can find the value of x using the fact that in a rectangle adjacent angles are complementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define that DEFG is a rectangle.
- We need to define the measures of angle EDF and DFG in terms of x.
- We need to state the property that angle EDG is a right angle.
- We need to state that angles EDF and DFG sum to 90.
- Finally, we need predicates for all points, lines, angles, and shapes.
