PROBLEM 2477 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center D.
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.
- Line segments AB and BC are chords of the circle.
- Angle ABC is an inscribed angle.
- Arc AC has a measure of 122 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
- Angle ABC intercepts arc AC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of arc AC is 122 degrees.
- The question asks for the measure of angle ABC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We can use the relationship between the inscribed angle and its intercepted arc to find the measure of angle ABC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the points, circle, lines, arc, and the relationship between the inscribed angle and the intercepted arc.
