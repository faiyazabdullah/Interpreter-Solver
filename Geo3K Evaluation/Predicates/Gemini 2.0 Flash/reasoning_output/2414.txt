PROBLEM 2414 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find A E if A B = 12, A C = 16, and E D = 5.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a figure with points A, B, C, D, and E.
- I can see lines AB, AC, AE, AD, CD, and BE.
- There are parallel markings on lines CD and BE, indicating that they are parallel.
- I can see the measurements AB = 12, AC = 16, ED = 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- CD is parallel to BE.
- Since CD is parallel to BE, triangle ACD is similar to triangle ABE.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12
- AC = 16
- ED = 5
- AE = AD - ED
- We want to find AE

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AE.
- We can use similar triangles to find the length of AE.
- Triangle ACD is similar to triangle ABE, which implies that AC/AB = AD/AE.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and lines.
- State the given measurements.
- State the parallel relationship between the lines CD and BE.
- State the similarity between the triangles ACD and ABE.
- State the ratios between corresponding sides of the similar triangles.
- Include AE = AD - ED
