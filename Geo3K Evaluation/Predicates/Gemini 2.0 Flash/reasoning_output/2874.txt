PROBLEM 2874 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If P R \parallel K L, K N = 9, L N = 16, P M = 2 K P, find M N.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points L, N, K, R, Q, P, M.
- I can see lines LN, NK, LM, MK, RP, KL, MN, MQ, and QP.
- I can see right angles at angles MNK and NML.
- I can see that Line RP is parallel to Line KL.
- I can see that KN = 9 and LN = 16, and PM = 2 KP

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line MN is perpendicular to line KL at point N.
- Line MN is perpendicular to line LM at point M.
- Line RP is parallel to line KL.
- Points R, Q, and P lie on lines LM, MN, and MK respectively.
- We know PM = 2 KP

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- KN = 9
- LN = 16
- PM = 2 KP
- We are asked to find MN

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of MN.
- We have information about KL, PM, and KP.
- Since RP is parallel to KL, we can possibly use similar triangles.
- Also, we know MN is perpendicular to KL, so NML and NMK are right angles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points and lines.
- Define all shapes (triangles, etc.).
- Note any parallel and perpendicular relationships.
- State the given measurements.
- Relate measurements using proportionality due to parallel lines.
- Set up equations to find MN.
