PROBLEM 2920 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For trapezoid Q R T U, V and S are midpoints of the legs. If Q R = 4 and U T = 16, find V S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid QRTU with vertices labeled Q, R, T, and U.
- Points V and S are located on the legs QU and RT, respectively.
- The figure suggests that VS is a midsegment of the trapezoid.
- QR = 4
- UT = 16
- V is the midpoint of QU
- S is the midpoint of RT

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- QRTU is a trapezoid.
- VS is the midsegment of the trapezoid.
- V is the midpoint of QU.
- S is the midpoint of RT.
- QR and UT are parallel.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of QR = 4
- Length of UT = 16
- We are asked to find the length of VS.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of the midsegment VS.
- The midsegment of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, midpoints, given lengths, and the midsegment property.
