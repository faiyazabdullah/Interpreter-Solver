PROBLEM 2534 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: E B \parallel D C. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a triangle ADC with vertices labeled A, D, and C.
- Line segment EB is parallel to line segment DC.
- Point E lies on AD, and point B lies on AC.
- The length of line segment AE is 4.
- The length of the line segment ED+AE, or AD, is 10.
- The length of line segment AB is x - 2.
- The length of line segment BC is 5.
- Angle ADE is congruent to angle ABE.
- Angle AED is congruent to angle ABC.
- Angle A is common to both triangle ABE and ADC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since EB is parallel to DC, triangle ABE is similar to triangle ADC.
- Corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.
- AD = AE + ED, so ED = AD - AE
- AC = AB + BC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AE = 4
- AD = 10
- AB = x - 2
- BC = 5
- ED = AD - AE = 10 - 4 = 6
- AC = AB + BC = x - 2 + 5 = x + 3

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- We can use the similarity of the triangles and the proportionality of the corresponding sides to set up an equation and solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the points, lines, triangles, and their measurements.
- Need to represent the parallel relationship between the lines EB and DC.
- Need to represent the similar relationship between triangles ABE and ADC.
- Need to represent the relationship of corresponding sides of the similar triangles being proportional.
