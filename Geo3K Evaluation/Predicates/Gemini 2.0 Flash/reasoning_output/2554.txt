PROBLEM 2554 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with a line BD perpendicular to AC.
- Points A, B, C, and D are visible.
- The length of CD is given as 8.
- The length of BD is given as 16.
- The length of AD is given as x.
- The length of AB is given as y.
- The length of BC is given as z.
- Angles BDA and BDC are right angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles ADB and BDC are right triangles.
- Line BD is perpendicular to AC.
- Triangles ABC, ADB, and BDC are similar triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CD = 8
- BD = 16
- AD = x
- AB = y
- BC = z

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find y.
- y represents the length of side AB in triangle ABC and triangle ADB.
- The similarity of the triangles and Pythagorean theorem can be used to solve for y.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, and triangles.
- Specify right angles and perpendicularity.
- Specify the given lengths.
- Specify the similarity of the triangles, and the Pythagorean theorem.
