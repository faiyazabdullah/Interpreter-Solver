PROBLEM 2765 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the scale from B to B'.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points A, B, B', D, and Q.
- There are line segments connecting these points.
- There are two triangles, one with vertices Q, B, and D, and another, larger triangle with vertices Q, B', and A.
- There are parallel lines AB' and DB.
- The distance from Q to B is labeled as 6.
- The distance from Q to B' is labeled as 8.
- I need to find the scale from B to B'.
- Line segment DB is parallel to line segment AB'.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles QDB and QAB' are similar due to the parallel lines DB and AB'.
- Therefore, the sides are proportional.
- The length QB = 6
- The length QB' = 8
- The triangles QDB and QAB' are similar.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- QB = 6
- QB' = 8

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question implies finding the ratio of the sides QB' to QB to establish a scale factor.
- The scale factor from B to B' is the ratio QB'/QB = 8/6 = 4/3.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points.
- Define the line segments.
- Define the triangles.
- State that the lines DB and AB' are parallel.
- Define the measurements of QB and QB'.
- State the similarity of the two triangles.
- Define the scale factor from B to B'.
