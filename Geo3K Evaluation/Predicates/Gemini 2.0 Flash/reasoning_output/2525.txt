PROBLEM 2525 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Given that the perimeter of \triangle A B C = 25, find x. Assume that segments that appear tangent to circles are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center E.
- Points A and C lie on the circle.
- Line AC is a diameter of the circle.
- Line AB is tangent to the circle at A.
- Line BC is tangent to the circle at C.
- Length of line segment AB is given as 3x.
- Perimeter of triangle ABC is given as 25.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is formed by the points A, B, and C.
- Since AB and BC are tangent to the circle at A and C respectively, Angle(EAB) and Angle(ECB) are right angles (tangent to radius).
- Since AC is the diameter of the circle, angle ABC is a right angle.
- Thus, triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- Tangents from an external point to a circle have equal lengths. So, BA = BC.
- Since BA = BC, 3x = BC.
- The perimeter of triangle ABC = AB + BC + AC = 25.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AB = 3x
- Length of BC = 3x
- Perimeter of triangle ABC = 25
- Length of AC = Diameter of the circle

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We have AB = 3x, BC = 3x.
- The perimeter equation is AB + BC + AC = 25, substituting gives 3x + 3x + AC = 25.
- Therefore 6x + AC = 25.
- We also know that triangle ABC is right angled at B. By Pythagoras theorem, AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2, so (3x)^2 + (3x)^2 = AC^2
- Which gives 9x^2 + 9x^2 = AC^2, so 18x^2 = AC^2, and AC = sqrt(18x^2) = 3x*sqrt(2).
- Substituting this into 6x + AC = 25 we have 6x + 3x*sqrt(2) = 25
- From this equation we can solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points, lines, circle, and triangle.
- State the tangency of AB and BC to the circle.
- State that AC is a diameter.
- State that AB = 3x.
- State that perimeter of ABC is 25.
- State that triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- State AB = BC.
- Pythagoras theorem.
