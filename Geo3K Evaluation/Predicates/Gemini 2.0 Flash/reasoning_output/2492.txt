PROBLEM 2492 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A B \cong D F. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center L.
- There are two chords AB and DF.
- A line segment CE connects points C and E.
- Point C lies on AB, point E lies on DF.
- CE is a diameter of the circle.
- Angles ACB and DEF are right angles.
- The length of Arc AD is 2x + 14.
- The length of Arc BF is 9x.
- Arcs AD and BF are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AB and DF are chords of the circle.
- CE is a diameter of the circle and is perpendicular to AB and DF.
- Since CE is perpendicular to AB and DF, it bisects the corresponding arcs.
- Arc AC is congruent to Arc BC.
- Arc DE is congruent to Arc EF.
- Given Arc AD is congruent to Arc BF.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Arc AD = 2x + 14
- Arc BF = 9x
- Since Arc AD is congruent to Arc BF, their measures are equal.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are given Arc AB is congruent to Arc DF, therefore, Arc AD is congruent to Arc BF.
- We need to find the value of x.
- This is done by equating the measures of the congruent arcs.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles, arcs, and the circle.
- State that AB and DF are chords.
- State that CE is a diameter.
- State the right angles.
- State that Arc AD is congruent to Arc BF.
- State the measures of the arcs.
