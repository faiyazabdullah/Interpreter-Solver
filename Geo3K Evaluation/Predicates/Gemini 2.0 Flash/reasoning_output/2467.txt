PROBLEM 2467 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle N C L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center C.
- There are points R, M, N, L on the circumference of the circle.
- There are line segments CR, CM, CN, CL.
- Angle MCN is labeled as 60 degrees.
- Angle RCL is labeled as (3x+5) degrees.
- Angle RCM is labeled as (x-1) degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- CR, CM, CN, CL are radii of the circle.
- Angles MCN, RCL, and RCM are central angles.
- The sum of angles RCM and MCN equals angle RCN.
- The sum of angles RCN and NCL equals 360 degrees. The sum of the angles around point C is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle MCN = 60 degrees.
- Measure of angle RCL = (3x+5) degrees.
- Measure of angle RCM = (x-1) degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle NCL.
- We can find the value of 'x' by using the fact that MeasureOf(Angle(RCM)) + MeasureOf(Angle(MCN)) + MeasureOf(Angle(NCL)) + MeasureOf(Angle(LCR)) = 360.
- First we can find measure of angle RCN which is MeasureOf(Angle(RCM)) + MeasureOf(Angle(MCN)), or (x-1)+60 = (x+59)
- After finding x and the angles, we can use geometry relationships and angle addition to find angle NCL.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and points.
- Define the angles.
- Represent the measurements.
- Express the relationships between the angles.
