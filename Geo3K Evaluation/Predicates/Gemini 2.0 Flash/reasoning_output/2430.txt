PROBLEM 2430 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find X Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a triangle XYZ.
- There is a point W on the line segment YZ.
- There is a right angle at vertex W of the triangle XWZ.
- There are congruence markings on line segments YW and ZW.
- The length of line segment ZW is not explicitly stated.
- The length of line segment YZ is expressed as 18 + 2y.
- The length of line segment ZX is expressed as 5y - 6.
- The length of the line segment YW is not explicitly stated, but is congruent to line segment ZW.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XWZ is a right triangle.
- Line segment YW is congruent to ZW.
- Point W is the midpoint of line segment YZ.
- YW + ZW = YZ

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(YZ) = 18 + 2y
- LengthOf(ZX) = 5y - 6
- LengthOf(YW) = LengthOf(ZW)
- LengthOf(YW) + LengthOf(ZW) = LengthOf(YZ)
- 2 * LengthOf(ZW) = LengthOf(YZ)
- 2 * LengthOf(ZW) = 18 + 2y
- LengthOf(ZW) = 9 + y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find XZ.
- The length of XZ is given as 5y - 6.
- To find the length of XZ, we need to find the value of y.
- Since LengthOf(ZW) = 9 + y and LengthOf(ZX) = 5y - 6, we need more information to find the value of y.
- Since YW is congruent to ZW, YW = ZW. YW + ZW = YZ. Thus, 2ZW = YZ. So 2ZW = 18 + 2y and ZW = 9 + y.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent all the points, lines, angles, and congruence.
- I need to represent the equations for the lengths of lines.
