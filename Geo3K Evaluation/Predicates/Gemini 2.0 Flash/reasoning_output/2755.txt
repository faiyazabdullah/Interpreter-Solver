PROBLEM 2755 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle H.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a pentagon EFGHJ with vertices labeled E, F, G, H, J.
- The angles at vertices F, G, H, and J are labeled as (x+20)°, (x+5)°, (x-5)°, and (x+10)° respectively.
- The angle at vertex E is labeled as x°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a pentagon, so the sum of the interior angles is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees.
- The sum of the angles at each vertex is:  x + (x+20) + (x+5) + (x-5) + (x+10) = 5x + 30 degrees.
- Therefore, 5x + 30 = 540 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠E = x°
- m∠F = (x+20)°
- m∠G = (x+5)°
- m∠H = (x-5)°
- m∠J = (x+10)°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find m∠H, which is equal to (x-5)°.
- Need to solve for x using the sum of the interior angles of the pentagon.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the pentagon, the angles, and the equation representing the sum of the interior angles.
- Do not include the final answer, only the relationships.
