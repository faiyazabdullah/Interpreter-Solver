PROBLEM 2960 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: find \sin S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle STR with vertices labeled S, T, R.
- Side ST is marked as 4 units.
- Side TR is marked as 3 units.
- Side SR is marked as 5 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex T.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle STR is a right triangle with right angle at T.
- Sides ST and TR are perpendicular.
- Side SR is the hypotenuse.
- Angle S is opposite to side TR, and adjacent to side ST.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ST = 4 units (given)
- TR = 3 units (given)
- SR = 5 units (given)
- The question asks for sin S.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the sin of angle S.
- This requires using the definition of sine: opposite/hypotenuse.
- The opposite side is TR and the hypotenuse is SR.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Need to define the relationship between angle S, side TR, and side SR.
