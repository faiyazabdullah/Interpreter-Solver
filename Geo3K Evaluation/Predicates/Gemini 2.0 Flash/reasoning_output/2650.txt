PROBLEM 2650 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure containing three triangles: Triangle ABC, Triangle ABD, and Triangle CBD.
- Point A, B, C, and D are labeled.
- Line segments AB, BC, CD, DA, and BD are visible.
- Length of AD is 8.8 units.
- Length of BC is 8.5 units.
- Segment CD is labeled with length x.
- Segment AB is labeled with length z.
- Segment BD is labeled with length y.
- Angle ADB is a right angle.
- Angle BDC is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle, with the right angle at D.
- Triangle CBD is a right triangle, with the right angle at D.
- Line BD is perpendicular to line AC.
- Triangles ABC is also a right triangle, with the right angle at B.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 8.8
- BC = 8.5
- CD = x
- BD = y
- AB = z
- Since angle ADB and BDC are right angles, then line BD is perpendicular to line ADC.
- Since angle ABC is a right angle, Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- In Triangle ABD, z is the hypotenuse.
- In Triangle CBD, 8.5 is the hypotenuse.
- In Triangle ABC, the hypotenuse is AC, and AC = x + 8.8.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- To find x, we can utilize similar triangle relationships or the geometric mean theorem.
- Triangle CBD is similar to Triangle ABC, since they both share angle C.
- Also, Triangle ABD is similar to Triangle ABC since they both share angle A.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, triangles, and right angles.
- Represent all given lengths.
- Represent the perpendicular relationship.
- Represent similarity of triangles.
- Relate lengths of line segments.
- Represent that AC = x + 8.8
