PROBLEM 2601 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find A D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points A, B, C, D, and E.
- I see lines AB, BC, CD, DE, and AE.
- There are measurements labeled as 5, 3, 3.5, x, and y.
- I can identify triangles ABC and ADE.
- The segments BE and CE are marked with arrows. This indicates that they are corresponding parts.
- Side AB has a length of 3
- Side BC has a length of 5.
- Side DE has a length of 3.
- Side CD has a length of 3.5.
- AE has a length of y.
- BE has a length of x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- I assume that the line segment BE is parallel to CD. Then triangle ABE is similar to triangle ACD
- AB + BC = AC. AC = 3 + 5 = 8.
- AE + ED = AD

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- I have the length of AB = 3, BC = 5, CD = 3.5, DE = 3.
- AC = AB + BC = 3 + 5 = 8.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find AD
- Since the triangles ABE and ACD are similar, so AB/AC = AE/AD, and BE/CD = AB/AC. Also AE/AD = DE/AC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, shapes, and measurements.
- Define relationships such as similarity, ratios, and measurements.
