PROBLEM 2900 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the triangle. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 5 in.
- Angle ACB is marked as 59 degrees.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 5 in (given)
- Angle ACB = 59 degrees (given)
- Need to calculate the length of AC to find the area

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of triangle ABC
- We know angle C and side AB
- Need to use trigonometric ratios to find side AC, the adjacent side to angle C
- Area = 0.5 * base * height = 0.5 * AB * AC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Use Tan(angle C) = AB/AC to find AC
- Then use Area = 0.5 * AB * AC
