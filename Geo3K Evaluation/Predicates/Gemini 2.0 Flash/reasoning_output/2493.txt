PROBLEM 2493 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find F G.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with center M.
- I see points F, H, P, J, G, K on the circle.
- I see lines FG and HJ intersecting at N.
- I see lines KP intersecting at L.
- I see that ML is perpendicular to FG.
- I see that MN is perpendicular to HJ.
- I see that FL = 24.
- I see that HJ = 48.
- I see that arc HP = 65.
- I need to find FG.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- FG and HJ are chords.
- KP is a chord.
- ML is perpendicular to FG, so ML bisects FG.
- MN is perpendicular to HJ, so MN bisects HJ.
- M is the center of the circle.
- Since MN bisects HJ, HN = NJ = HJ/2 = 48/2 = 24.
- Since ML bisects FG, FL=LG and HN=NJ.
- Arc HP is related to angle HMP.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FL = 24
- HJ = 48
- arc HP = 65 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find the length of FG.
- Since ML bisects FG, we have FL = LG.
- Therefore, FG = FL + LG = 2 * FL.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle, points, lines, and angles.
- State the perpendicularity relationships.
- State that ML bisects FG and MN bisects HJ.
- State the given length measurements of FL and HJ.
- Express that FG = 2 * FL and HJ = 2 * HN.
