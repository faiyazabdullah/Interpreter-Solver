PROBLEM 2839 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The area A of the shaded region is given. Find x. A = 66 cm^2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center K.
- There is a diameter JL.
- The shaded region is a semicircle.
- The diameter is labeled as x cm.
- The angle at K is labeled 180 degrees.
- The area of the shaded region is given as 66 cm^2

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The shaded region is a semicircle, which is half the area of the circle.
- The diameter JL passes through the center K.
- Radius = x/2

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Diameter = x
- Area of semicircle = 66 cm^2
- Area of the entire circle = 2 * Area of semicircle = 2 * 66 = 132 cm^2
- Area of circle = pi * r^2
- Radius (r) = x/2
- Therefore: pi * (x/2)^2 = 132

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x.
- This requires using the formula for the area of a circle, with area and radius known in terms of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, diameter, radius, area of the shaded region.
- Must establish the relationship between the diameter, radius and area of the circle.
- Semicircle Area = 66 cm^2
- Diameter = x
