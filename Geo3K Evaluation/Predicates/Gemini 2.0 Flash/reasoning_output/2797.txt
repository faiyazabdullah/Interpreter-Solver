PROBLEM 2797 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If R L = 5, R T = 9, and W S = 6, find R W.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a figure with points labeled R, L, T, W, S.
- There are line segments connecting these points, forming a quadrilateral and a triangle.
- There are arrows on segments LW and TS indicating these segments may be related or parallel to each other.
- The question provides numerical measurements for RL, RT, and WS.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- It is implied that line segments LW and TS are parallel by the direction of the arrows, and RL and RT form transversal lines.
- The figure suggests similar triangles, namely triangle RLW and triangle RTS.
- Point W lies on the line segment RS.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RL = 5
- RT = 9
- WS = 6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of RW.
- Since triangles RLW and RTS are similar, there exists a proportional relationship between corresponding sides.
- We can use the parallel lines LW and TS to establish that angle RLW is congruent to angle RTS and angle RWL is congruent to angle RST, making triangle RLW similar to triangle RTS.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define all the points and line segments.
- Need to capture the given length information.
- Need to indicate that point W lies on line RS.
- Need to express the similarity between the triangles RLW and RTS.
- Since RW + WS = RS, RS can be represented as RW + 6
- The similar triangle proportionality will allow determination of RW:
RL/RT = RW/RS  => 5/9 = RW/(RW+6)
This requires RW, RS, RL, RT to be defined.
