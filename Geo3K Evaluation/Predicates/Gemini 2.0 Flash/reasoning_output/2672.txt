PROBLEM 2672 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure composed of points A, B, C, D.
- There are lines connecting these points: AB, BC, BD, AD, AC.
- The lengths of BC, AD are labeled as 30, 8 respectively.
- The length of AC is labeled as 28.
- The length of BD is labeled as y, which we are to find.
- Point A lies on the line CD.
- Angle ABD is congruent to angle ACB.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC and triangle ABD share angle B which is congruent.
- Triangle ABC and triangle ABD are similar by the Side-Angle-Side similarity theorem.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 30
- AD = 8
- AC = 28
- BD = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BD which is y.
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides of similar triangles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, measurements, and similarity.
