PROBLEM 2844 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram ABCD.
- The base of the parallelogram is labeled as 28 ft.
- One side of the parallelogram, BC, is labeled as 9 ft.
- The angle between the base AB and side BC is 45 degrees.
- There's a dashed line representing the height of the parallelogram.
- A right angle is indicated where the height meets the base.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, which means opposite sides are parallel.
- The height of the parallelogram is perpendicular to the base.
- A right triangle is formed by the side BC, the height, and a segment of the base.
- The angle at B is given as 45 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of base AB = 28 ft
- Length of side BC = 9 ft
- Angle ABC = 45 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- Area of a parallelogram = base * height
- We know the base (28 ft). We need to find the height.
- The height can be found using the right triangle formed.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the parallelogram ABCD.
- Define the measurements: base, side, angle.
- Indicate the right angle formed by the height.
- Relate the height to the side BC and angle ABC using trigonometry (sine function).
