PROBLEM 2858 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABDA and a triangle ABC
- Points are labeled as A, B, C, D, and E
- Angles are labeled as 68°, (3x-15)°, 2x°, and (y²)°

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The angles in quadrilateral ABDA must sum to 360 degrees
- The angles in triangle ABC must sum to 180 degrees

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ADB = 68°
- Angle DBE = (3x-15)°
- Angle DAE = 2x°
- Angle ACE = (y²)°
- No side lengths are given

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- We can use the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral to solve for x. The sum of the angles of triangle ABC is equal to 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, angles, quadrilateral, and triangle
- Represent the measurements of the angles
- State that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360°
