PROBLEM 2732 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A square is inscribed in a circle having a radius of 6 inches. Find the length of the side of the square.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center not labeled.
- I can see a square inscribed in the circle. The square is labeled ABCD.
- The side length of the square is unknown.
- The circle's radius is given as 6 inches. Point E is located on Line AB, and Line AE is labeled "6 in."
- The square has four sides: AB, BC, CD, and DA.
- The square has four right angles at vertices A, B, C, and D.
- The circle circumscribes the square, which means all vertices of the square lie on the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The square's diagonals intersect at the center of the circle.
- The distance from the center of the circle to any vertex of the square is the radius of the circle.
- All sides of the square are congruent.
- Each angle of the square is 90 degrees.
- The diagonal of the square can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, and it equals the diameter of the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 6 inches, therefore AE = 6.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of the side of the square.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the shapes: circle, square.
- Define all points.
- Define all lines and their lengths.
- Define relationships: InscribedIn, IsRadiusOf, Equals, RightAngle, Square.
