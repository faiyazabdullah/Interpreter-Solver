PROBLEM 2761 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify two triangles in the image. Let's call the triangle on the left Triangle ABC, where point X lies on line AC. The triangle on the right will remain unnamed for now.
- In Triangle ABC, the length of side BC is labeled 3x, and the length of segment BX is 8. In the other triangle, one side has length 6 and the corresponding segment has length x.
- There are congruence markings on sides AX and CX in triangle ABC, indicating AX is congruent to CX. In the other triangle, the corresponding sides have the same congruence markings.
- There are angle markings at angle A and angle C in triangle ABC, indicating that these angles are congruent to corresponding angles in the other triangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point X is the midpoint of AC in triangle ABC, which makes BX a median of triangle ABC.
- The two triangles share two congruent angles and the sides adjacent to these angles are proportional. The triangles are similar by SAS similarity.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 3x
- BX = 8
- corresponding side = 6
- corresponding segment = x
- AX = CX

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- Since we have similar triangles, we can set up a proportion.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the shapes as triangles.
- Indicate congruence between angles.
- Establish midpoint X on AC
- Define the side lengths with variables
- Use similarity to establish a proportion.
