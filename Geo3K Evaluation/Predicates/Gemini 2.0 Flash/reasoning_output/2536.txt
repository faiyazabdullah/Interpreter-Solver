PROBLEM 2536 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diameters of \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C are 10, 30 and 10 units, respectively. Find Z X if A Z \cong C W and C W = 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three circles, \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C.
- There is a line that intersects all three circles at points E, A, Z, X, B, Y, W, C, D.
- Points A, B, and C are the centers of circles \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C, respectively.
- The diameters of \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C are given as 10, 30, and 10, respectively.
- It is given that AZ \cong CW and CW = 2.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points E, A, Z, X, B, Y, W, C, D all lie on the same line. Therefore, they are collinear.
- AZ and CW are congruent line segments.
- Line segments EA, AZ, XB, BY, WC, and CD are radii of the respective circles.
- Diameter of circle A is EA + AZ = 10.
- Diameter of circle B is XB + BY = 30.
- Diameter of circle C is WC + CD = 10.
- The line segment AD contains the diameters of circles A, B, and C, as well as some extra segments.
- Since AZ \cong CW, LengthOf(AZ) = LengthOf(CW).
- Since CW = 2, LengthOf(AZ) = 2.
- AX = radius of circle B = 15, EZ = 5, ZC = Radius of C + LengthOf (ZB).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DiameterOf(Circle(A)) = 10
- DiameterOf(Circle(B)) = 30
- DiameterOf(Circle(C)) = 10
- LengthOf(CW) = 2
- LengthOf(AZ) = LengthOf(CW) = 2
- RadiusOf(Circle(A)) = 5
- RadiusOf(Circle(B)) = 15
- RadiusOf(Circle(C)) = 5

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of ZX.
- ZX = ZB + BX. BX is the radius of circle B, thus BX=15.
-ZB=AB -AZ .AB= Radius of A + Radius of B ,AB = 5+15 = 20. Thus,ZB =20-2=18.
- ZX =ZB +BX=18+15= 33.
- Need to identify and represent lengths and relationships to calculate the length of ZX.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points and circles.
- Specify the collinearity of the points.
- Provide measurements of diameters of each circle.
- Indicate that AZ and CW are congruent and CW = 2.
- Relate AZ to CW.
- Establish that length of radii are half the length of the diameters.
