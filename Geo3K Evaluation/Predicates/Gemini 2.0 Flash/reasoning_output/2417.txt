PROBLEM 2417 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot P, the radius is 2 inches, find the length of \widehat R S. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle centered at point P.
- There are four points on the circle: Q, R, S, T.
- Line segments PR, PS, PT, and PQ are drawn.
- Angle QPR is marked as 112 degrees.
- Angle RPS is marked as 130 degrees.
- The radius of the circle is 2 inches.
- We need to find the length of arc RS.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- PR, PS, PT, and PQ are radii of the circle and thus are equal in length.
- Angle RPS is the central angle subtended by arc RS.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 2 inches.
- The central angle RPS is 130 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the length of arc RS.
- The formula for arc length is: arc length = (central angle/360) * 2 * pi * radius

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, radii, angles, and radius length.
- Need to represent the central angle subtended by the arc.
