PROBLEM 2980 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the length of \widehat Z Y. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center X.
- There are points Y and Z on the circumference of the circle.
- There is a line segment XY and a line segment XZ.
- Angle YXZ is given as 75 degrees.
- The length of the line segment XY is given as 6 inches, which is the radius of the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- XY and XZ are radii of the circle, so they are congruent.
- Arc ZY is a part of the circumference of the circle.
- Angle YXZ is a central angle that subtends arc ZY.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of the circle (XY) = 6 inches.
- Central angle YXZ = 75 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of arc ZY.
- To find the arc length, I need to use the formula: arc length = (central angle / 360) * (2 * pi * radius)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, radius, central angle, and arc.
- Need to specify the measurements of the radius and the central angle.
- The central angle must be in degrees.
- Represent that XY is a radius and has length 6.
