PROBLEM 2779 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle WXY.
- There is a line segment ZT parallel to XY.
- Length of ZT is 10.
- Length of XY is 16.
- Length of YA is 20.
- Length of WB is x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle WZT is similar to triangle WXY because ZT is parallel to XY.
- We can use similar triangles to find the value of x.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of ZT = 10.
- Length of XY = 16.
- Length of YA = 20.
- Length of WY = Length of WA - Length of YA = (x + 20).
- We need to find the length of WA = x + 20

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- We need to set up a proportion using the similarity of triangles WZT and WXY.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangle WXY.
- Define the line segments ZT and XY.
- Define the points Z, T on WX, WY respectively.
- State that ZT is parallel to XY.
- Define the lengths of ZT, XY, and YA.
- Express the similarity between the triangles.
- Express the proportional relationship of similar triangles using the given values.
- Define the length of WA as x + 20
- Define the length of WB as x.
