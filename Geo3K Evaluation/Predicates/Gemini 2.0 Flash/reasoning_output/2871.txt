PROBLEM 2871 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the kite.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a kite shape labeled ABCD.
- There are two dashed lines, AC and BD, that appear to be diagonals of the kite.
- The length of diagonal AC is labeled as 32 cm.
- The length of diagonal BD is labeled as 21 cm.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a kite.
- The diagonals of the kite are perpendicular.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 32 cm
- BD = 21 cm

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the kite.
- The area of a kite is half the product of the lengths of its diagonals.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the kite and its vertices.
- Define the lengths of the diagonals.
- Define the area of the kite as half the product of the lengths of the diagonals.
