PROBLEM 2711 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AC is labeled as x.
- Side BC is labeled as 12.
- Side AB is labeled as y.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- There is an angle of 45 degrees at vertex A.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.
- Angle BAC = 45 degrees.
- Since angle BAC = 45 degrees and angle ABC = 90 degrees, then angle BCA = 180 - 90 - 45 = 45 degrees.
- Therefore, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = BC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 12 units (given).
- Angle BAC = 45 degrees (given).
- AB = y
- AC = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of y.
- Since triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle and BC = 12, then y = AB = BC = 12

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- State AB=BC since its an isosceles right triangle
