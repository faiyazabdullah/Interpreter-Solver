PROBLEM 2896 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle J M L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral JKLM with vertices labeled J, K, L, M.
- Angle JKL is marked as 109 degrees.
- Side ML is marked as 6.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral JKLM is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel.
- Opposite angles of a parallelogram are congruent.
- Consecutive angles of a parallelogram are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle JKL = 109 degrees (given).
- Length of side ML = 6 (given).
- Because JKLM is a parallelogram, side JK is parallel to side ML and side JM is parallel to side KL.
- Also, opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent, therefore JK = ML = 6 and JM = KL.
- Also, angle JML is supplementary to angle JKL, so m∠JML + m∠JKL = 180.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle JML.
- We know that JKLM is a parallelogram, and consecutive angles are supplementary.
- Need to find m∠JML such that m∠JML + m∠JKL = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, the given angle, the side length, and the relationship between angles JKL and JML.
- Need to represent supplementary angles.
