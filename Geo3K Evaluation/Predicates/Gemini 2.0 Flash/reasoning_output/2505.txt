PROBLEM 2505 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the rhombus.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rhombus ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect each other.
- The length of half of diagonal AC is 7 ft.
- The length of half of diagonal BD is 12 ft.
- Diagonals bisect each other perpendicularly.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rhombus.
- Diagonals AC and BD bisect each other at their midpoints.
- Diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Half of the length of AC is 7 ft, so AC = 14 ft.
- Half of the length of BD is 12 ft, so BD = 24 ft.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- The area of a rhombus is half the product of its diagonals.
- The lengths of the diagonals are needed.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rhombus.
- Represent the diagonals.
- Represent the lengths of the diagonals.
- Represent the relationship between half-diagonals and full diagonals.
- Represent the area calculation using the diagonals.
