PROBLEM 2705 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- Angle A is labeled as (5x-19) degrees.
- Angle B is labeled as (6y-57) degrees.
- Angle C is labeled as (3x+9) degrees.
- Angle D is labeled as (3y+36) degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The question implies that the quadrilateral ABCD might be a parallelogram.
- If ABCD is a parallelogram, then opposite angles are congruent.
- If ABCD is a parallelogram, then adjacent angles are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = (5x - 19) degrees
- MeasureOf(Angle(B)) = (6y - 57) degrees
- MeasureOf(Angle(C)) = (3x + 9) degrees
- MeasureOf(Angle(D)) = (3y + 36) degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- This requires using the properties of a parallelogram.
- We can use the property that opposite angles are equal. Therefore, Angle A = Angle C and Angle B = Angle D.
- Alternatively, we can use the property that consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, Angle A + Angle B = 180 and Angle B + Angle C = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, angles, and their measurements.
- Need to represent the relationships if it's a parallelogram (either opposite angles are equal or consecutive angles are supplementary).
