PROBLEM 2636 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of the variable x in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines, namely line BD and line AE.
- I can see two intersecting lines, namely line BF and line CE.
- The lines BF and CE intersect at point G.
- The point B is the intersection of lines BD and FH.
- The point G is the intersection of lines AE and CG.
- Angle AGE is marked as x degrees.
- Angle CGE is marked as 55 degrees.
- Angle FBH is marked as y degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line BD is parallel to Line AE.
- Angle CGE and angle AGE are supplementary angles because they form a linear pair.
- Angle CBG and angle CGE are alternate interior angles, so they are equal.
- Angle AGE and angle DBG are corresponding angles, so they are equal.
- Angle FBH and angle DBG are vertical angles, so they are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle CGE is 55 degrees.
- Measure of angle AGE is x degrees.
- Measure of angle FBH is y degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- I need to find a relationship between x and other angles in the figure to solve for x.
- Since BD is parallel to AE, alternate interior angles are equal.
- Also, supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallel lines.
- Represent the angles.
- Represent the relationship between the angles.
- Represent supplementary angles.
- Represent the measure of the angles.
