PROBLEM 2497 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In H, the diameter is 18, L M = 12, and m \widehat L M = 84. Find H P. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center H.
- Points J, K, L, and M lie on the circle.
- Line segment JK is a diameter of the circle.
- Line segment LM is a chord of the circle.
- Line segment HP is perpendicular to LM.
- The diameter JK has length 18.
- The length of LM is 12.
- The measure of arc LM is 84 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- H is the center of the circle.
- JK is a diameter.
- LM is a chord.
- HP is perpendicular to LM.
- Since HP is perpendicular to LM, it bisects LM. Thus, LP = PM = LM/2 = 12/2 = 6.
- Since H is the center and K is a point on the circle, HK is a radius. Since JK is a diameter, HK = JK/2 = 18/2 = 9.
- Triangle HPL is a right triangle since HP is perpendicular to LM.
- HP is a leg of the right triangle HPL.
- HL is a radius of the circle since L lies on the circle. HL = HK = 9.
- LP is a leg of the right triangle HPL. LP = 6.
- By the Pythagorean theorem, HL^2 = HP^2 + LP^2, or 9^2 = HP^2 + 6^2. Then HP^2 = 81 - 36 = 45, so HP = sqrt(45)

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Diameter JK = 18
- LM = 12
- arc LM = 84
- Radius HK = HL = 18/2 = 9
- LP = LM/2 = 12/2 = 6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of HP.
- HP is a leg of right triangle HPL.
- We know the length of the hypotenuse HL and the leg LP. We can solve for HP using the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and its center.
- Define the points on the circle.
- Define the lines and line segments.
- Define the diameter and chord.
- Define the perpendicular relationship.
- Define the right triangle.
- Define the length of the diameter and the chord.
- Define the radius.
- Define the arc measure.
- Relate HP, LP and HL using the Pythagorean theorem.
