PROBLEM 2577 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: Triangle(R,S,T) and Triangle(V,U,W)
- In Triangle(R,S,T), points P lies on RS, and we have the following sides: RS, ST, RT, RP, PS
- In Triangle(V,U,W), point Q lies on VU, and we have the following sides: VU, UW, VW, VQ, QU
- RS is divided into two segments: RP and PS, and RP is congruent to PS.
- VU is divided into two segments: VQ and QU, and VQ is congruent to QU.
- Angle RST is congruent to angle UVW.
- Angle VUW is congruent to angle SRT.
- Length of ST is 13.5
- Length of QU is 3, therefore Length of VU is 6.
- Length of UW is 9.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- RP is congruent to PS, so P is the midpoint of RS.
- VQ is congruent to QU, so Q is the midpoint of VU.
- Angle RST is congruent to angle UVW.
- Triangle RST is similar to Triangle UWV
- SR/VW = ST/VU = RT/WU.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of ST = 13.5
- Length of QU = 3
- Length of UW = 9
- Length of VU = VQ + QU = 3 + 3 = 6
- RP = PS = x
- Length of RS = RP + PS = x + x = 2x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking to find the value of x.
- This requires using the properties of similar triangles to find the length of RS.
- We know that Triangle(RST) is similar to Triangle(UVW).
- The ratio of sides ST/VU = RS/UW

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, congruent sides and angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Express the similarity between the triangles and the proportional relationship between sides.
