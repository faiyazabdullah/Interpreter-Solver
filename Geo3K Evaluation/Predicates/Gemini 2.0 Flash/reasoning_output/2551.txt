PROBLEM 2551 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If X M = 4, X N = 6, and N Z = 9, find X Y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle XYZ.
- Points M and N lie on sides XY and XZ respectively.
- There are directed line segments (vectors) along the lines YZ, XN, and MY.
- We are given lengths XM = 4, XN = 6, and NZ = 9.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points X, M, and Y are collinear.
- Points X, N, and Z are collinear.
- Triangle XYZ is formed by the lines XY, YZ, and XZ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XM = 4
- XN = 6
- NZ = 9
- Therefore, XZ = XN + NZ = 6 + 9 = 15

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the length of XY.
- Notice the directed line segments imply that triangles XMN and XYZ are similar.
- If the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
- We have the side lengths XM, XN, XZ and need to find XY.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to specify the points, lines, and the triangle.
- We need to specify the lengths of the given line segments.
- We need to state that X, M, Y are collinear and X, N, Z are collinear.
- Because of the implication from the directed line segments, we need to say that triangle XMN and triangle XYZ are similar. This gives us the equation XM/XY = XN/XZ.
