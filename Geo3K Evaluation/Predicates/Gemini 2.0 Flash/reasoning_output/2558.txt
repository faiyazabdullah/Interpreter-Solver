PROBLEM 2558 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find R S if \triangle Q R S is an equilateral triangle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle QRS with vertices labeled Q, R, S.
- Side QR is labeled as 4x.
- Side RS is labeled as 2x+1.
- Side QS is labeled as 6x-1.
- The problem states that triangle QRS is an equilateral triangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle QRS is an equilateral triangle.
- All sides of an equilateral triangle are congruent.
- Therefore, QR = RS = QS.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- QR = 4x
- RS = 2x+1
- QS = 6x-1

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of RS.
- Since the triangle is equilateral, we can set up equations based on the side lengths.
- We can equate the expressions for the sides to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the fact that it is equilateral, and the expressions for the side lengths.
- Must establish congruence between the sides of the triangle.
