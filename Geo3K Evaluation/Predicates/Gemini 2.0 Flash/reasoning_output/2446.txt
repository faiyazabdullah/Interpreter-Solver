PROBLEM 2446 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: M C = 7, R M = 4, and A T = 16. Find M B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- There are points R, S, T on sides AC, AB, BC, respectively
- There is a point M inside the triangle where lines AR, BS, CT intersect
- Sides AR and RC have congruent marks.
- Sides AS and SB have congruent marks.
- Sides BT and TC have congruent marks.
- RM = 4, MC = 7

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AR = RC since sides AR and RC have congruent marks.
- AS = SB since sides AS and SB have congruent marks.
- BT = TC since sides BT and TC have congruent marks.
- Point M is the intersection of cevians AR, BS, and CT.
- Since AR=RC, AS=SB, and BT=TC, the cevians are medians and M is the centroid of the triangle.
- The cevians are medians.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RM = 4, MC = 7, AT = 16

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of MB.
- Since AM, BM, CM are medians, M is the centroid
- Using the centroid properties for medians, AM = 2/3*AT

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent triangle ABC, points A, B, C, R, S, T, and M
- Represent lines AR, BS, CT, AC, AB, BC
- Represent that R is on AC, S is on AB, T is on BC, M is the intersection
- Represent congruent sides AR=RC, AS=SB, BT=TC
- Represent RM = 4, MC = 7, AT=16.
- Represent the relationship between medians and centroids.
