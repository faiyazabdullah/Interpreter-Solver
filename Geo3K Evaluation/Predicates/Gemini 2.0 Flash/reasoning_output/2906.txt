PROBLEM 2906 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral A B C D is a rectangle. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle ABCD.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.
- Angle DAE is labeled as (5x+5)°.
- Angle ABE is labeled as (2x+1)°.
- Angle DBC is labeled as (y^2)°.
- Angle DCE is labeled as (3y+10)°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. All angles are right angles.
- The diagonals of a rectangle are equal and bisect each other.
- This means AE = BE = CE = DE.
- Triangles AEB, BEC, CED, and DEA are all isosceles triangles.
- Therefore, angle DAE = angle ADE, and angle ABE = angle BAE, and angle DBC = angle BDC, and angle DCE = angle DEC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle DAE = (5x+5)°.
- Angle ABE = (2x+1)°.
- Angle DBC = (y^2)°.
- Angle DCE = (3y+10)°.
- Since triangle AEB is isosceles, angle BAE = angle ABE, so angle BAE = (2x+1)°.
- Since angle DAE = angle ADE, so angle ADE = (5x+5)°.
- Also, angle ABE = angle BAE, so (5x+5) = (2x+1)°.
- The angles of a rectangle are right angles, so angle DAB = 90°.
- Angle DAB = angle DAE + angle BAE, so 90 = (5x+5) + (2x+1).

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- The key relationship to use is the fact that the sum of angles DAE and BAE is 90°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the rectangle ABCD.
- Define the intersection point E of the diagonals AC and BD.
- Define the angles DAE, ABE, DBC, and DCE and their measurements.
- State that ABCD is a rectangle.
- State that the diagonals AC and BD are equal.
- State that AE = BE.
- State the relationship between angles DAE, BAE and the right angle DAB.
