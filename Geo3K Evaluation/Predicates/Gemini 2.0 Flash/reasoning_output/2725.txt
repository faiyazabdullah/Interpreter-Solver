PROBLEM 2725 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diameters of \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C are 10, 30 and 10 units, respectively. Find Y W if A Z \cong C W and C W = 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three circles: Circle A, Circle B, and Circle C.
- The centers of the circles are points A, B, and C respectively.
- A line passes through the centers A, B, and C and intersects each circle at two points.
- The points E, Z, X, Y, W, and D lie on this line.
- A Z is congruent to C W.
- The diameters of the circles A, B, and C are 10, 30, and 10 units, respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The points E, A, Z, X, B, Y, C, W, and D lie on the same line, so they are collinear.
- AZ is a radius of circle A and CW is a radius of circle C.
- The diameters of the circles are given.
- The line containing the centers of the circles passes through the intersection points of the circles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Diameter of Circle A = 10, so Radius of Circle A (AZ) = 5.
- Diameter of Circle B = 30, so Radius of Circle B = 15.
- Diameter of Circle C = 10, so Radius of Circle C (CW) = 5.
- It is given that AZ = CW = 2. (This contradicts the radius value. The problem statement must have an error, since it says A Z is congruent to C W and C W = 2, so A Z = 2.)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find YW, given AZ is congruent to CW and CW = 2.
- We know that CY is the radius of Circle C, which has a length of 5.
- Therefore, YW = CY - CW = 5 - 2 = 3.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circles and their centers.
- Define the line passing through the centers.
- Define the points on the circles and line.
- Specify the given lengths of the diameters.
- Specify that A Z is congruent to C W and C W = 2.
- Specify the relationship between radii and diameters.
