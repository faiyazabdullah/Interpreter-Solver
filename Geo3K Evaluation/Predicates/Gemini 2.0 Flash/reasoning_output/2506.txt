PROBLEM 2506 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle K J L if J K = 2 b + 3 and J M = 3 a.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a parallelogram JKLM with vertices J, K, L, and M.
- The diagonals JL and KM intersect at point R.
- The length of side JK is labeled as 2b + 3.
- The length of side JM is labeled as 3a.
- The length of side ML is labeled as 45.
- The length of side KL is labeled as 21.
- The angle MLK is 70 degrees.
- The angle JLM is 30 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel and congruent.
- Opposite angles are congruent.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary.
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
- JM is parallel to KL, and JK is parallel to ML.
- JK = ML and JM = KL.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 2b + 3
- JM = 3a
- ML = 45
- KL = 21
- m∠MLK = 70°
- m∠JLM = 30°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle KJL.
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length: JK = ML and JM = KL.
- We have the measurements of KL and ML, and expressions for JK and JM. This implies we can solve for the variables a and b.
- Since JKLM is a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, therefore angle JML + angle MLK = 180. We can determine angle JML to be 110.
- We can find angle KJL.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram, vertices, sides, diagonals, and their relationships.
- Represent the given measurements of side lengths and angles.
- State the properties of a parallelogram regarding sides and angles.
- Relate opposite sides' lengths and adjacent angles.
