PROBLEM 2890 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find P T.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a figure with points P, T, R, S, and Q.
- There is a right angle at R.
- There are two triangles: PTR and PSQ.
- Line segment RS is parallel to line segment PQ.
- Length of RQ is given as 5.
- Length of RS is given as 10.
- Length of PS is given as 25.
- Length of TR is labeled as x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle PTR is a right triangle with right angle at R.
- Since RS is parallel to PQ, triangles PTR and PSQ are similar.
- PT and TR form the legs of the triangle PTR.
- PS and SQ are the hypotenuse and part of the base of triangle PSQ respectively.
- RQ is a segment of the base of a larger triangle which includes R, S, Q.
- Because the lines are parallel and the triangle is similar, we can set up ratios.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of RQ = 5
- Length of RS = 10
- Length of PS = 25
- Length of TR = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the length of PT.
- Since PTR and PSQ are similar triangles, we can use ratios to solve.
- TR/RQ = PT/PS

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the points, lines, triangles, the right angle, and the parallel relationship.
- We need to establish the similarity between the triangles.
- We also need to state the length of the line segments.
- We will use similar triangles to relate the sides and the variable x
