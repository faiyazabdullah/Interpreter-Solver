PROBLEM 2464 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m is the perpendicular bisector of X Z, W Z = 14.9. Find W X.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains points W, X, Y, Z, D, T.
- There is a line m defined by points D and T.
- There are line segments WX, WY, WZ, XY, YZ.
- There is a right angle at angle XYW.
- Line m is the perpendicular bisector of segment XZ. This means WY is perpendicular to m, and XY is congruent to YZ. Also, Y is the midpoint of XZ.
- WZ = 14.9.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- m is perpendicular bisector of XZ, meaning m is perpendicular to XZ and Y is the midpoint of XZ.
- Angle XYW is a right angle, meaning XY is perpendicular to DT (line m).
- Since Y is on the perpendicular bisector m of XZ, and W is also on m, WX = WZ due to the perpendicular bisector theorem.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WZ = 14.9
- Since WX = WZ, then WX = 14.9

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find WX.
- Since m is the perpendicular bisector of XZ, then WX = WZ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and lines.
- Define perpendicular and congruent relationships.
- State WZ = 14.9.
