PROBLEM 2491 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Express the ratio of \cos B as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AC is marked as 24 units.
- Side BC is marked as 10 units.
- Side AB is marked as 26 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 24 units (given)
- BC = 10 units (given)
- AB = 26 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of \cos B.
- I need to find the adjacent side to angle B and the hypotenuse.
- In this case, adjacent side is BC and hypotenuse is AB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and the relationship between the cosine of angle B and sides BC and AB.
