PROBLEM 2658 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center G.
- There are points B, F on the circle.
- Point E is outside the circle.
- Line EB is tangent to the circle at point B.
- Line EF is a secant to the circle intersecting the circle at F.
- We are given lengths EB = 16, EF = 12, and FG = x where x is the radius.
- Since G is the center, GB is a radius, and GB = FG = x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- EB is tangent to the circle at B, therefore, angle EBG is a right angle.
- EFB is a secant, so we can apply the tangent-secant theorem.
- The tangent-secant theorem states that the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the length of the secant segment and its external segment.
- That is, EB^2 = EF * (EF + FD) but FD = 2r where r is radius. We have EF * (EF+2x)
- I meant, EB^2 = EF * ED.
- EB^2 = EF * (EF + diameter), EB^2 = EF * (EF + 2x).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- EB = 16, EF = 12, FG = x, GB = x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is to find the value of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, circle, and their relationship
- Define tangent, secant
- State the measurements given
- Define the tangent-secant theorem relationship
