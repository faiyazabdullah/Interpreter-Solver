PROBLEM 2461 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Q is the centroid and B E = 9. Find B Q.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Points D, E, F lie on the sides BC, AC, AB respectively.
- Point Q is the intersection of lines AE, BF, and CD.
- Point Q is labeled as the centroid of the triangle ABC.
- Length of BE is given as 9.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AE, BF, and CD are medians of the triangle ABC, intersecting at the centroid Q.
- Q is the centroid of triangle ABC. Therefore, Q lies on the medians AE, BF and CD.
- The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio. BQ : QF = 2:1 and AQ : QE = 2:1 and CQ : QD = 2:1.
- Since BE is a median, E is the midpoint of AC.
- Similarly, F is the midpoint of AB and D is the midpoint of BC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BE = 9 is given.
- We need to find BQ.
- We know that BQ/QE = 2.
- Let BQ = x. Then QE = BE - BQ = 9 - x.
- So, x / (9 - x) = 2
- x = 2 * (9 - x) = 18 - 2x
- 3x = 18
- x = 6
- Therefore, BQ = 6.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BQ.
- We know that BE is a median and Q is the centroid.
- BQ : QE = 2:1.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, medians, centroid, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include the property of the centroid dividing the median in a 2:1 ratio.
