PROBLEM 2735 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the trapezoid.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid ABCD.
- Points A, B, C, and D are vertices of the trapezoid.
- Line AB is perpendicular to line AE.
- The length of AE is 16 ft.
- The length of BD is 6 ft.
- The length of BE is 12 ft.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a trapezoid with bases AD and BC.
- BE is the height of the trapezoid, perpendicular to both AD and BC.
- Line segment AD is longer than line segment BC.
- Line segment BC is parallel to line segment BD

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AD = 16 ft
- Length of BD = 6 ft
- Length of BE = 12 ft

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is to find the area of the trapezoid.
- Area of trapezoid = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height
- We have the height (BE), and the lengths of the two parallel sides (AD and BC).
- Area = (1/2) * (AD + BD) * BE

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the trapezoid ABCD.
- Define the points A, B, C, and D.
- Define the lengths of AD, BD, and BE.
- Define that BE is the height of the trapezoid.
- Represent parallel sides.
