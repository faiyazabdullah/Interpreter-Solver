PROBLEM 2939 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Angle B is given as 60 degrees.
- Side AB is labeled as 18.
- Side BC is labeled as x.
- Side AC is labeled as y.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.
- Sides BC and AC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.
- Angle ABC is 60 degrees.
- Angle BAC is 30 degrees (since it's a right triangle and one angle is 60).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 18 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 60 degrees (given)
- BC = x
- AC = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x (BC).
- I can use trigonometric ratios (cosine) to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, right angle, given angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Use trigonometric relationships to solve for x.
