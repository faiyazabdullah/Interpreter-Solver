PROBLEM 2729 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram M N P R to find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram M N P R.
- There are points M, N, P, R, and Q.
- Line segments M N, N P, P R, and R M are sides of the parallelogram.
- Line segments M P and N R are diagonals that intersect at Q.
- Lengths of line segments are labeled: M N = 3x - 4, N P = 2y + 5, P R = 20, R M = 17.9, N Q = 15.4, P Q = 11.1.
- Angles are labeled: Angle M R P = 38 degrees, Angle M N R = 33 degrees, Angle P Q R = 83 degrees, Angle M Q N = 83 degrees, Angle R Q P = 83 degrees, Angle N Q P = 83 degrees, Angle M Q R = 83 degrees, R Q = 3z - 3, M Q = 4w - 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- M N P R is a parallelogram.
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and equal in length. Thus, M N || P R, M R || N P, and M N = P R, M R = N P.
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Thus, M Q = Q P, N Q = Q R.
- Angle M Q N and angle R Q P are vertically opposite angles and are equal.
- Angle P Q R and angle M Q N are vertically opposite angles and are equal.
- Angle M Q R and angle N Q P are vertically opposite angles and are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- M N = 3x - 4, N P = 2y + 5, P R = 20, R M = 17.9. Since M N P R is a parallelogram, M N = P R, and M R = N P. Thus, 3x - 4 = 20, 2y + 5 = 17.9.
- N Q = 15.4, P Q = 11.1. Since diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, R Q = N Q = 15.4, M Q = P Q = 11.1.
- R Q = 3z - 3, M Q = 4w - 3. Thus, 3z - 3 = 15.4, 4w - 3 = 11.1.
- Measure of angle M R P = 38 degrees, Measure of angle M N R = 33 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x.
- Since M N = 3x - 4 and M N = P R = 20, we have 3x - 4 = 20.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the parallelogram M N P R.
- Define the line segments and their lengths.
- Define the properties of a parallelogram (opposite sides equal, diagonals bisect each other).
- Define relevant equal expressions.
