PROBLEM 2814 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If W X Y Z is a kite, find W P.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a kite WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- There is a point P where diagonals intersect.
- The length of line WX is labeled as 6.
- The length of line XP is labeled as 4.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- WXYZ is a kite.
- The diagonals of a kite are perpendicular.
- The longer diagonal bisects the shorter diagonal.
- Therefore, XZ bisects WY at point P.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 6
- XP = 4

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of WP.
- Since XZ bisects WY at P, we know that WP = PY.
- The sides WX and WY are congruent since WXYZ is a kite. Thus Triangle WXP and Triangle WYP are congruent triangles. Since XZ bisects WY, it is also perpendicular to WY. So Triangle WXP is a right angle triangle. Using Pythagorean theorem, WP can be calculated

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the kite, its vertices, the point of intersection of diagonals.
- Need to specify the lengths of WX and XP.
- Need to state that diagonals are perpendicular.
- Need to state that diagonals bisect each other.
- Need to state that two adjacent sides are congruent
