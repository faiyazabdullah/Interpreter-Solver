PROBLEM 2611 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \overrightarrow Q P and \overrightarrow Q R are opposite rays, and \overrightarrow Q T bisects \angle S Q R. If m \angle S Q R = 6 x + 8 and m \angle T Q R = 4 x - 14, find m \angle S Q T.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points P, Q, R, S, T
- I can see lines PQ, QR, QS, QT
- Line PR is a straight line
- QS and QT are rays originating from point Q
- Angle SQR is an angle
- Angle TQR is an angle
- \overrightarrow Q P and \overrightarrow Q R are opposite rays
- \overrightarrow Q T bisects \angle S Q R

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \overrightarrow Q P and \overrightarrow Q R form a straight line, hence they are opposite rays
- \overrightarrow Q T bisects \angle S Q R, therefore \angle S Q T = \angle T Q R
- Point Q lies on the line PR.
- Since QT bisects angle SQR, m \angle S Q T = m \angle T Q R
- m \angle S Q R = m \angle S Q T + m \angle T Q R

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle S Q R = 6 x + 8
- m \angle T Q R = 4 x - 14
- The question implies that we can solve for x and then find m \angle S Q T.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m \angle S Q T.
- Need to use the fact that \overrightarrow Q T bisects \angle S Q R.
- m \angle T Q R = m \angle S Q T, and m \angle S Q R = m \angle S Q T + m \angle T Q R

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent all the points, lines, and angles in the figure.
- Need to represent the relationships between the angles, especially the angle bisector.
- Need to represent the measure of the angles.
