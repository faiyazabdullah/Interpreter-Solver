PROBLEM 2664 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: What is the measure of \angle B if m \angle A = 10?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points C, D, G, J, E, F on its circumference.
- There are line segments AB, AF, BC.
- Point H is the intersection of line segments FE and CD. Point G is the intersection of line segments BC and FE.
- Point E is the intersection of lines AB and the circle. Point J is the intersection of line AB and the circle.
- Angle A is labeled, and is given to be 15 degrees.
- Arc FC is labeled as 95 degrees.
- I am asked to find angle B given that angle A is 10 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points F, E, G, C, D, J lie on a circle.
- A, B are external points to the circle.
- Angles formed by the intersecting chords and tangents should be considered.
- Angle AEJ is supplementary to angle FEA.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠AEF = 15 degrees
- measure of arc FC = 95 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle B, given the measure of angle A is 10.
- I need to relate angle A and angle B to the arcs of the circle.
- m∠A = 10 degrees

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all the points, lines, circle.
- Define the intersections.
- Write down the measure of angle A and the arc FC.
- Express the relationship between the angles and arcs using the properties of secants.
