PROBLEM 2700 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Side AB and CD are marked as 15 mm.
- Angle ACB is marked as 30 degrees.
- There are right angle symbols at vertices A and D.
- Line BC is the base.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are parallel and equal in length, and all angles are right angles.
- Triangle ABC and ADC are right triangles.
- Angle ACB = 30 degrees.
- AB = CD = 15 mm.
- AD = BC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15 mm
- CD = 15 mm
- Angle ACB = 30 degrees.
- The area of rectangle ABCD is length * width, which is BC * AB.
- We need to determine the length of BC

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of rectangle ABCD.
- We know AB = 15 mm and angle ACB = 30 degrees.
- We need to find the length of BC.
- In triangle ABC, tan(30) = AB/BC. So, BC = AB/tan(30).
- Area = AB * BC = AB * (AB/tan(30)) = AB^2/tan(30)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the rectangle, points, lines, and angles.
- Represent the measurements.
- Represent the relationship between the angle and sides of the triangle.
- Represent the calculation for the area.
