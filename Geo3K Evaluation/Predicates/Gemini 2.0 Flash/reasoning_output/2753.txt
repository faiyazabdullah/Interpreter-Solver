PROBLEM 2753 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points B, C, D, I, E, G on it.
- There are intersecting chords ID and BC intersecting at point E within the circle.
- Line segment DE has a length of 8.1.
- Line segment IE has a length of 10.3.
- Line segment BE has a length of 17.
- Line segment EC has a length of x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The chords intersect inside the circle.
- The product of the segments of one chord is equal to the product of the segments of the other chord (Power of a Point theorem).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DE = 8.1
- IE = 10.3
- BE = 17
- EC = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x, which is the length of EC.
- I need to use the intersecting chords theorem to set up an equation and solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle.
- Represent the chords.
- Represent the points on the circle and the point of intersection.
- Represent the lengths of the segments.
- Represent the equation based on the intersecting chords theorem.
