PROBLEM 2565 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find \tan X.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle AXB with vertices labeled A, X, B
- Side AX is marked as 5 units
- Side XB is marked as 13 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle AXB is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AX and AB are perpendicular
- Side XB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AX = 5 units (given)
- XB = 13 units (given)
- AB length can be derived by using the Pythagorean theorem

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for tan X
- tan X = opposite/adjacent = AB/AX

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include Pythagorean relationship to find AB
- Must include trigonometric ratio to find tan X
