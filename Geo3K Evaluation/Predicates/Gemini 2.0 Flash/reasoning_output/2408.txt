PROBLEM 2408 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If X N = 6, X M = 2, and X Y = 10, find N Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle XYZ with points labeled X, Y, and Z.
- There are points M and N on sides XY and XZ respectively.
- Length of XN is given as 6.
- Length of XM is given as 2.
- Length of XY is given as 10.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point M lies on line segment XY.
- Point N lies on line segment XZ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XN = 6
- XM = 2
- XY = 10
- We need to find NZ.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of NZ.
- I will need to use the information given to figure out NZ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define all the points and line segments.
- Need to define the relationships between the points and lines.
- Need to input the measurement information.
