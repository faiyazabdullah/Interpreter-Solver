PROBLEM 2691 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find Q S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle QRS with vertices labeled Q, R, and S.
- Side QR is labeled as 5x.
- Side RS is labeled as 6x - 5.
- Side QS is labeled as 3x + 10.
- There are tick marks indicating that all three sides are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle QRS is an equilateral triangle because all three sides are marked congruent.
- This means that QR = RS = QS.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- QR = 5x
- RS = 6x - 5
- QS = 3x + 10
- Since it is an equilateral triangle, these measurements are equal.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of QS.
- This can be found after solving for x using the relationships between the sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the labeled sides, the equality of the sides, and the fact that it's an equilateral triangle.
- Need to create equality predicates based on the equilateral properties.
