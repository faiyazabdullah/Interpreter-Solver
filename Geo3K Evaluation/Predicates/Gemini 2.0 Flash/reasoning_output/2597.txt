PROBLEM 2597 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Equilateral pentagon P Q R S T is inscribed in \odot U. Find m \widehat Q R.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a circle with center U.
- I can see an inscribed pentagon PQRST.
- The pentagon is specified as equilateral.
- The question asks for the measure of arc QR.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since pentagon PQRST is equilateral, all its sides are congruent.
- Since pentagon PQRST is inscribed in circle U, all vertices of PQRST lie on circle U.
- Because the pentagon is equilateral, each of the arcs subtended by the sides are equal in measure.
- The total degree measure around a circle is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No explicit measurements are provided in the image.
- The total measure of the circle is implicitly known: 360 degrees.
- Since the pentagon is equilateral, the five arcs have equal measures, and their sum equals 360 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking for the measure of arc QR.
- Since the pentagon is equilateral, the measure of arc QR is 1/5 of the total measure of the circle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the pentagon, circle, point locations, and the relationship between them.
- Represent that the pentagon is equilateral and inscribed in the circle.
- State the relationship between arc QR and the circle's total measure.
- The measure of each of the 5 arcs are equal.
