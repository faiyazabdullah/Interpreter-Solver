PROBLEM 2754 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of the variable x in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral.
- The vertices are labeled as B, C, D, F.
- I see two parallel lines indicated by arrow marks.
- I see angles labeled as (5y)째, 120째, (2x)째, 108째.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line BD is parallel to line CF.
- Angle B and angle C are consecutive interior angles.
- Angle D and angle F are consecutive interior angles.
- Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle C is 120 degrees.
- Measure of angle F is 108 degrees.
- Measure of angle B is (5y) degrees.
- Measure of angle D is (2x) degrees.
- Angle C and Angle B are supplementary angles since the lines BD and CF are parallel.
- Angle D and Angle F are supplementary angles since the lines BD and CF are parallel.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of the variable x.
- I need to use the fact that angles D and F are consecutive interior angles, so supplementary.
- Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral.
- Need to represent the parallel lines.
- Need to represent the angle measurements.
- Need to represent the supplementary relationship.
- Need to represent that angles B and C, and angles D and F are supplementary angles.
