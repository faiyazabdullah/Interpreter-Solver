PROBLEM 2557 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with center B
- Points C, D, and E lie on the circle
- Line segments DE and CD form a right angle at D.
- Line segment CE is a diameter of the circle.
- Angle CBE is labeled as 3x degrees.
- Angle BCE is labeled as (5x - 12) degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle CDE is inscribed in a circle with the hypotenuse CE as the diameter. This means that angle CDE is a right angle.
- Since CE is the diameter, angle CDE is an inscribed angle subtending a diameter.
- Triangle CDE is a right triangle.
- Triangle BCE is a triangle with vertices on the circle and one vertex at the center, B.
- Since B is the center of the circle, BC = BE, therefore triangle BCE is isosceles.
- In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. So, angle BCE = angle BEC.
- We know the measure of angle BCE is (5x - 12) degrees.
- We know the measure of angle CBE is 3x degrees.
- Since angle BCE = angle BEC, angle BEC is also (5x - 12) degrees.
- The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. So, in triangle BCE, angle BCE + angle BEC + angle CBE = 180.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle CBE = 3x degrees.
- Angle BCE = (5x - 12) degrees.
- Angle BEC = (5x - 12) degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We can use the fact that the sum of the angles in triangle BCE is 180 degrees to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- We need to represent that triangle BCE is isosceles.
- We need to represent the sum of angles in a triangle being 180 degrees.
- We need to represent that the angles BCE and BEC are congruent.
