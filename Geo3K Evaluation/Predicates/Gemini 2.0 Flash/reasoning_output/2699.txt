PROBLEM 2699 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot X, A B = 30, C D = 30, and m \widehat C Z = 40. Find N D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center X.
- Points A, B, C, D, Y, and Z lie on the circle.
- Line segments AB and CD are chords of the circle.
- Line segment XY is perpendicular to chord AB at point M.
- Line segment XZ intersects chord CD at point N.
- Arc CZ is annotated with m \widehat{CZ} = 40.
- AB = 30
- CD = 30

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AB = CD, chords AB and CD are congruent.
- Because AB and CD are congruent chords in the same circle, they are equidistant from the center X.
- XY is perpendicular to AB, so M is the midpoint of AB.
- XZ intersects CD at N.
- Since XY is perpendicular to AB, Angle AMX and Angle BMX are right angles.
- The measure of arc CZ is 40 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AB = 30.
- Length of CD = 30.
- Measure of arc CZ = 40 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of ND.
- Because AB = CD, they are equidistant from the center
- Since chords AB and CD are congruent, the arcs subtended by them are congruent, implying that arc AB = arc CD. Also the distance from the center to the chords are the same.
- We also know that a line from the center of the circle perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, chords, perpendicularity.
- Represent the equality of chords.
- Represent the given measurements.
- Represent that M is midpoint of AB.
- Represent that m arc CZ = 40.
