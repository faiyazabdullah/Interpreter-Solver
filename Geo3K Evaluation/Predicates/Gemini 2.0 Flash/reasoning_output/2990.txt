PROBLEM 2990 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60. Find the measure of \angle 8.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, W.
- I can see lines defined by pairs of these points.
- I can see angles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- I see parallel lines WB and AD, as indicated by the arrows.
- m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line WB is parallel to line AD.
- Angle 1 and the angle adjacent to it on line BF form a linear pair, thus their measures sum to 180 degrees.
- Angle 3 and the angle adjacent to it on line GA form a linear pair, thus their measures sum to 180 degrees.
- Angle 8 and the angle at point Q also on line AD, together make a linear pair.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 50 degrees
- m \angle 3 = 60 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of angle 8.
- This will require using the parallel lines and transversal properties.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, and angles.
- Represent the parallel lines.
- Represent the given angle measurements.
- Capture the relationship between angles formed by the parallel lines and transversals.
