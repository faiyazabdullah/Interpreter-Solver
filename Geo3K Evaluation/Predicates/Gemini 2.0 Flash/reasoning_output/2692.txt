PROBLEM 2692 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallelograms. One is ABCD and the other one is AEFB.
- I can see a line segment WW', a line segment W'F and a line segment WF.
- The length of WF is 14, the length of W'F is 10.5, and the length of WW' is x.
- W, W', F, A, B, C, D, and E are points.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The length of WF is the sum of the length of WW' and W'F.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of WF = 14
- Length of W'F = 10.5
- Length of WW' = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- This requires using the relationship between WF, WW' and W'F.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the line segments, their lengths, and the relationship between the lengths.
