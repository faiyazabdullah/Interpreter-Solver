PROBLEM 2881 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find E G if G is the incenter of \triangle A B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- There are points D, E, F, and G inside the triangle.
- Lines AE, AG, BG, CG are drawn.
- Lines AE, BD, and CF are perpendicular to AC, AB, and BC respectively.
- The length of BC is 12, and the length of AG is 13.
- Point G is labeled as the incenter of triangle ABC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a triangle.
- Point G is the incenter of triangle ABC.
- GD is perpendicular to AC, GE is perpendicular to AB, and GF is perpendicular to BC.
- Since G is the incenter, GD, GE, and GF are the radii of the incircle, thus GD = GE = GF.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 12
- AG = 13

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the length of EG.
- Since G is the incenter, EG is the radius of the incircle, and it is perpendicular to AB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, incenter, perpendicular lines, and given measurements.
- Establish that GD = GE = GF
- Since G is the incenter, it lies on the angle bisectors.
- Need predicates to represent these geometric relationships.
