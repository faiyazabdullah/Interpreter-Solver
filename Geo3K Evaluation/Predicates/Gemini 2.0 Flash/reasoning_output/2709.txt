PROBLEM 2709 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Circle J has a radius of 10 units, \odot K has a radius of 8 units, and B C = 5.4 units. Find C K.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two circles, circle J and circle K.
- There is a line passing through both circles that intersects them at points A, B, C, and D.
- There are points J and K, which are presumed to be the centers of the respective circles.
- B and C are the intersection points of the circles.
- The radii of circle J and circle K are given.
- The length of BC is given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, J, B, C, K, and D lie on a straight line.
- Line AB is a segment of the secant of circle J and circle K.
- The circles are tangent to each other at point C.
- The line passing through the points is secant to both circles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of circle J = 10 units.
- Radius of circle K = 8 units.
- BC = 5.4 units.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of CK.
- The diagram shows that C, K, and D lie on a line, and that K is the center of the circle, and CD is a radius of \odot K. Thus C K = Radius of \odot K.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circles, points, lines, and given measurements.
- Represent the relationship between the radius and the center of the circle.
- Radius of circle J is AJ and JB.
- Radius of circle K is KC and KD.
