PROBLEM 2921 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle T to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T
- Side RS is marked as 4√3 units
- Side ST is marked as 10√3 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex S

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RST is a right triangle with right angle at S
- Sides RS and ST are perpendicular
- Side RT is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RS = 4√3 units (given)
- ST = 10√3 units (given)
- Angle T is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle T
- Since we know two sides of the right triangle, we can use trigonometric ratios (tan, sin, cos) to find the angle
- tan(T) = RS/ST

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include trigonometric relationship to solve for angle T
