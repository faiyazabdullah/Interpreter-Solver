PROBLEM 2837 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find a in the given parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral WXYZ with diagonals WZ and XY intersecting at point A.
- Measurements are given for line segments WA, AY, XA, and AZ: WA = 10, AY = 2, XA = a-7, AZ = 2b-6.
- The figure appears to be a parallelogram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- If WXYZ is a parallelogram, then its diagonals bisect each other.
- This means that WA = AZ and XA = AY.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WA = 10
- AY = 2
- XA = a-7
- AZ = 2b-6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of 'a'.
- Since diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, we have XA = AY, which gives a-7 = 2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the quadrilateral WXYZ and the intersection point A of its diagonals.
- State that WXYZ is a parallelogram.
- Indicate the length of WA, AY, XA, and AZ.
- State that WA = AZ and XA = AY due to parallelogram property.
- Include the equation XA = AY as it's needed to find 'a'.
