PROBLEM 2721 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If P R \parallel K L, K N = 9, L N = 16, and P M = 2K P, find K M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle KLM with vertices labeled K, L, M.
- I can see a line segment RP that is parallel to KL.
- I can see a line segment MN that is perpendicular to KL.
- I can see point Q at the intersection of RP and MN.
- I can see that KN = 9 and LN = 16.
- I can see that PM = 2KP.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle KLM is a triangle.
- RP is parallel to KL.
- MN is perpendicular to KL. Therefore, MN is perpendicular to RP.
- Triangle KPM is similar to triangle KLM.
- Triangle LMR is similar to triangle LKN.
- N is a point on line segment LK.
- Q is a point on line segment RP and MN.
- P is a point on line segment KM.
- R is a point on line segment LM.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- KN = 9
- LN = 16
- PM = 2KP

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of KM.
- This requires using the similarity between the triangles KPM and KLM.
- We also need to use the given ratios and measurements.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, parallel lines, perpendicular lines, measurements, and relationships.
- Need to represent the similarity relationship for solving.
- Capture ratios between sides of the triangles.
