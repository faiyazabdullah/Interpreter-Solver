PROBLEM 2817 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the triangle. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 15 ft
- Side BC is marked as 12 ft
- Side AC is marked as 9 ft
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse
- The area of a right triangle is calculated as (1/2) * base * height

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15 ft (given)
- BC = 12 ft (given)
- AC = 9 ft (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the triangle
- The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements
- Area is calculated using 1/2 * base * height
- Base = BC = 12
- Height = AC = 9
