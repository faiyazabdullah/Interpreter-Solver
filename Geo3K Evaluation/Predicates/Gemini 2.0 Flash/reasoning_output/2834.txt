PROBLEM 2834 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure containing two right triangles.
- Triangle AYB has a transversal AN.
- The segments and angles are labeled: AY = 5, YB = y, AN = x, NB= z, and YN+NB=14.
- Angle A and N are right angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle AYB is divided into two smaller triangles, namely triangles ANY and ANB.
- Angles YAN and ANB are right angles.
- AN is perpendicular to YB.
- AB is perpendicular to AY.
- Triangles AYB, ANY, and ANB are right triangles

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AY = 5
- YN + NB = 14
- AN = x
- AB = z
- YB = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of z, where z is the length of AB.
- Since we have similar triangles, we know the proportion of the side lengths must match between the triangles. This means AY/YB = AN/NB = AB/AY
- This allows us to write the proportion of side lengths in terms of the variable names given in the diagram.
- We have two equations with two unknowns.
- We can substitute one into the other to reduce it down to one equation with one variable.
- From there, we solve for z

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and triangles.
- Define which angles are right angles.
- Define known lengths.
- Define similar triangles.
- Define ratios/proportions of similar triangles.
