PROBLEM 2857 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find G H in the kite.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a kite named FGHJ.
- The kite has points labeled F, G, H, J, and A.
- Line segments FG, GH, HJ, JF are visible.
- Line segments GJ and FH intersect at A.
- Length of line segment GA is 12 units.
- Length of line segment AH is 15 units.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- FGHJ is a kite. Diagonals are perpendicular.
- GJ and FH are diagonals of the kite.
- GJ and FH intersect at A.
- GA and AJ are congruent.
- FA and AH are not necessarily congruent.
- Angle FAJ and angle GAH are vertical angles and are congruent.
- Angles at A are right angles.
- Triangle GAH and triangle JAH are right triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of GA = 12.
- Length of AH = 15.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of GH.
- GAH is a right triangle.
- I can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find GH.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the kite FGHJ
- Define the points F,G,H,J,A
- Define the lines FG,GH,HJ,JF,GJ,FH
- Define the measures GA, AH
- State the perpendicularity of GJ and FH
- Define the right triangle GAH
- Apply the Pythagorean Theorem to triangle GAH
