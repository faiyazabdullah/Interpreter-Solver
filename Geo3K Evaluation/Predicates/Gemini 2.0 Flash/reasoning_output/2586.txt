PROBLEM 2586 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle MLP with vertices labeled M, L, P.
- Side ML is labeled as 2y+6.
- Side MP is labeled as 4.
- Side LP is labeled as 5x-3.
- Angle LMP is labeled as 60 degrees.
- Angle MPL is labeled as 60 degrees.
- Angle PLM is not labeled but can be determined

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle MLP is an isosceles triangle because angle LMP and angle MPL are equal. This implies that side LP is congruent to side MP.
- Therefore, 5x-3 = 4.
- Also, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, angle PLM is also 60 degrees, making the triangle equilateral.
- Therefore, side ML is also congruent to side MP and LP.
- So, 2y+6 = 4.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ML = 2y+6
- MP = 4
- LP = 5x-3
- Angle LMP = 60 degrees
- Angle MPL = 60 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Since LP = MP, 5x-3=4

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, points, sides, and angles.
- Represent the congruent sides and angles.
- Include the measurements.
