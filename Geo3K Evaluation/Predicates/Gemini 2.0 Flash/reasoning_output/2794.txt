PROBLEM 2794 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For the pair of similar figures, use the given areas to find the scale factor from the blue to the green figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two rectangles. The left rectangle is blue, and the right rectangle is green.
- The area of the blue rectangle is 8 square inches. The length of one side is 4 inches.
- The area of the green rectangle is 32 square inches. The length of one side is x inches.
- The vertices of the green rectangle are labeled A, B, C, and D.
- The two rectangles are similar

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both figures are rectangles.
- Since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides are equal.
- The area of a rectangle is given by length * width.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Area of blue rectangle = 8 sq in
- Length of one side of blue rectangle = 4 in
- Area of green rectangle = 32 sq in
- Length of one side of green rectangle = x in

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the scale factor from the blue figure to the green figure.
- We are given the area of the rectangles. We can find the scale factor from the square root of the ratio of the areas of similar figures.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle shapes and the given measurements.
- Need to state the relationship between areas of similar figures and the scale factor.
