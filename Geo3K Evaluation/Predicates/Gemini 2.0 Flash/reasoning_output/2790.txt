PROBLEM 2790 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: U J = 9, V J = 3, and Z T = 18. Find S V.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see several triangles and line segments with points labeled S, T, U, V, Y, Z, J.
- Several line segments have congruence markings.
- The lengths of UJ and VJ are labeled as 9 and 3, respectively.
- The length of ZT is given as 18.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- From the congruence markings, we can deduce several relationships:
    - ST = TU
    - SV = VZ
    - SY = YZ
- J is the intersection of SU, ZT, and YV.
- We have similar triangles because of parallel lines: SU || ZT, YV || ST, YV || ZU.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- UJ = 9
- VJ = 3
- ZT = 18
- We are looking for SV

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of SV
- We need to establish the relationships between different line segments

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define all points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- We need to define all the equalities based on congruence markings.
- We need to specify the lengths of UJ, VJ, and ZT.
