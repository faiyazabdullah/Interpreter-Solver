PROBLEM 2552 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Which segments are parallel?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a figure with points A, B, C, D, E.
- I can see lines AB, BC, DE, AE, AD, BE.
- I can see angles at each vertex.
- The angles are labeled with their degree measures: 60°, 70°, 60°, 40°, 80°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- I can see a quadrilateral ABED and a triangle BEC.
- Point E lies on the line DC.
- I can calculate the angle DAE which is 180 - 60 - 40 = 80 degrees
- I can calculate the angle ABE which is 180 - 70 - 80 = 30 degrees
- I can calculate the angle EBC which is 180 - 80 - 60 = 40 degrees
- The sum of angles in triangle ABE is 60+40+80 = 180 degrees
- Sum of the angles in triangle BEC is 80 + 60 + 40 = 180 degrees.
- I cannot determine if any lines are parallel from the given information.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle DAE is composed of angle DAE = 80
- Angle ADE is 60
- Angle DEA is 40
- Angle ABE is 30
- Angle EBC is 40
- Angle BEC is 80
- Angle ECB is 60
- Angle ABC is 70

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to determine if any lines are parallel based on the given information.
- I need to look at pairs of lines and see if corresponding angles or alternate interior angles are congruent.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define all the points, lines, angles and their measures.
- I cannot definitively determine any parallel lines from this information.
