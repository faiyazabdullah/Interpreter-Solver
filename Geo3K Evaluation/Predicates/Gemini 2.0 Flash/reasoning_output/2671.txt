PROBLEM 2671 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find K L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, triangle XYZ and triangle JKL.
- Triangle XYZ has vertices X, Y, and Z.
- Triangle JKL has vertices J, K, and L.
- The length of XY is 5.
- The length of YZ is 15.
- Angle Y is 51 degrees.
- The length of JK is 4.
- Angle J is 51 degrees.
- The length of KL is x.
- Angle X and Angle J are marked with the same arc, indicating they are congruent.
- Angle Y and Angle J are congruent, which implies that triangles XYZ and JKL are similar.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ and triangle JKL are similar.
- Angle Y is congruent to Angle J.
- We can set up a proportion to solve for x since the triangles are similar.
- The ratio of corresponding sides of similar triangles are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XY = 5
- YZ = 15
- JK = 4
- KL = x
- Angle Y = Angle J = 51 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of KL, which is represented by x.
- We need to use the similarity of the two triangles to set up a proportion and solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the triangles and their vertices.
- Need to represent the lengths of the sides.
- Need to represent the measures of the angles.
- Need to state that the triangles are similar.
- Need to set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the sides of the similar triangles.
