PROBLEM 2730 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find G F.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, RST and EFG
- In triangle RST, side RT = 15, side ST = 10, side RS = 20.7
- Angle SRT = 27 degrees, Angle ST R= 43 degrees, Angle RTS = 110 degrees
- In triangle EFG, side EF = 11.25, side GF = x
- Angle FEG = 27 degrees, Angle EFG = 110 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The problem states that triangles RST and EFG are similar.
- Since triangles are similar, corresponding angles are equal.
- Angle SRT = Angle FEG = 27 degrees
- Angle RTS = Angle EFG = 110 degrees
- Angle RST = Angle EGF
- Sides are proportional in similar triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given the lengths of RT, ST, and RS and EF, we need to find GF which corresponds to ST.
- We can set up a proportion to solve for x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find GF (x).
- Use the similarity of triangles to find the corresponding side ratio.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the two triangles.
- Define similarity between the triangles.
- Define all angles and side lengths given.
- Set up the proportional sides relation for corresponding sides.
