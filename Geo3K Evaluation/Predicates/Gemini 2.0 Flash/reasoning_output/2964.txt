PROBLEM 2964 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, one on the left (Triangle ADF) and one on the right (Triangle BCE)
- There is a rectangle in the middle (Rectangle CDEZ, I assume Z based on context)
- Point A, D, F, C, E, B are defined. There is a measurement of 8 along the hypotenuse AD of the left triangle. The angle at A is 30 degrees.
- The segment DC is labeled 'z', segment DF is labeled 'x', segment AB is 'y', and segment FE is 6.
- There are right angles at F and E. Angle B is 45 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ADF is a right triangle.
- Triangle BCE is a right triangle.
- Rectangle CDEF has opposite sides equal. Thus DC = FE = z and DF = CE = x
- Angle AFD and BEC are right angles.
- Line DC is parallel to line FE
- Line DF is parallel to line CE
- Angle A is 30 degrees and Angle B is 45 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 8
- Angle DAF = 30 degrees
- FE = 6
- Angle EBC = 45 degrees
- DF = x and CE = x
- DC = z and FE = z

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of z, which is the length of segment DC or FE
- We need to find the height of triangle BCE
- We also need to find the length of x, which is DF

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to use trigonometric ratios to find x and AF
- Since Triangle BCE is a right triangle with angle B 45 degrees, Triangle BCE is an Isosceles triangle. Thus x = CE = BE
- Since we found x, we can use this info to find z.
