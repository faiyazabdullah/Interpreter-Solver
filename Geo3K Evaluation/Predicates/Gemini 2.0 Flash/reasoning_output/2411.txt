PROBLEM 2411 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a large circle and two smaller circles inside it.
- The two smaller circles are congruent and tangent to each other at point B.
- The large circle circumscribes the two smaller circles.
- The diameter of the large circle is 20.
- Points A and C are the centers of the top and bottom circles respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two smaller circles are tangent to each other.
- The diameter of the large circle equals twice the diameter of a smaller circle.
- The smaller circles are inscribed within the larger circle.
- The shaded region is the area inside the large circle but outside of the two smaller circles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The diameter of the large circle is 20.
- This implies that the radius of the large circle is 10.
- The radius of each smaller circle is half the radius of the large circle, which is 5.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- This can be found by subtracting the area of the two smaller circles from the area of the large circle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circles, their radii, and their relationship.
- Need to represent the shaded region.
- Need to relate the area of the shaded region to the areas of the circles.
