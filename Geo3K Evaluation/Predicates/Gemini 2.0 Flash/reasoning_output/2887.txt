PROBLEM 2887 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot F, F H \cong F L and F K = 17. Find J G.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center F.
- There are points J, K, M, G, H, and L on the circle.
- There are line segments FH, FL, FK, HG, KM, and JG.
- FH and FL are congruent.
- HG is perpendicular to FH.
- KM is perpendicular to FL.
- Length of HL is given as 8.
- Length of FK is given as 17.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Circle F has radius FK.
- Since FH and FL are congruent, they are equidistant from the center F.
- HG and KM are chords of the circle and are perpendicular to FH and FL respectively.
- JG and KM are chords of the circle.
- Since FH = FL, chords JG and KM have the same length.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FH = FL (given)
- HL = 8 (given), which implies FH = FL = 4.
- FK = 17 (given). Since F is the center, FK is the radius of the circle.
- Since FH is perpendicular to HG, and FL is perpendicular to KM, angles FHG and FKM are right angles.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of JG.
- Since FH and FL are equidistant from center F, and HG is perpendicular to FH and KM is perpendicular to FL, then JG = KM.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define circle F.
- Need to define all points.
- Need to represent the perpendicular relationships.
- Need to represent the congruent relationships between FH and FL.
- Need to represent the measurements given.
- Need to represent the fact that HG and KM are chords.
