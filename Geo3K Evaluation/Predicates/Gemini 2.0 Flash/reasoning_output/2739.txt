PROBLEM 2739 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side AB is marked as 21 cm
- Side AC is marked as 17 cm
- There is a line segment AF that is perpendicular to CD
- The length of CF is marked as 8 cm

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel: AB || CD and AD || BC
- AF is the altitude to base CD
- Angle AFC is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 21 cm
- AC = 17 cm
- CF = 8 cm

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- The area of a parallelogram can be found by multiplying the base by the height.
- CD = AB = 21
- DF = CD - CF = 21 - 8 = 13
- However, to find the height, we'll focus on the given values in the figure. We are given CD is 21 cm and CF is 8 cm. The height of the parallelogram AF is unknown. We will solve for the length of AF which will be used to calculate the area

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, the altitude, measurements, and relationships
- Define all geometric shapes present.
- Represent all given measurements and their relationships.
