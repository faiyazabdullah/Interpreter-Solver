PROBLEM 2860 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of the variable t.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- There is a point D on the line BC and a line segment AD.
- There are right angle symbols at angles BAC and BDA.
- Side AD is marked as 12 units.
- Side BD is marked as 24 units.
- Side CD is marked as t+1 units.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A.
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle with right angle at D.
- Line AD is perpendicular to Line BD.
- Line AB and AC are perpendicular.
- Triangles ABD and ABC are similar because they share angle B and both have right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 12 units
- BD = 24 units
- CD = t+1 units
- BC = BD + CD = 24 + t + 1 = t + 25 units

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of t.
- This requires using the similarity of triangles ABC and ABD.
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides based on the similarity.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangles, right angles, measurements, and similarity relationships.
- Set up ratios based on the similarity to establish the value of t.
