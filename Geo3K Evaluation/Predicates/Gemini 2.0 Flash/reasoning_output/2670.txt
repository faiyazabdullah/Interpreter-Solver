PROBLEM 2670 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral A B C D is a rectangle. m \angle 2 = 40. Find m \angle 3.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a rectangle ABCD.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.
- There are angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- We are given that m \angle 2 = 40.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, all angles are right angles (90 degrees).
- Opposite sides of the rectangle are parallel (AB || CD and AD || BC).
- Diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other.
- Angles 2 and 6 are alternate interior angles formed by diagonal AB and parallel lines AD and BC. Therefore, Angle 2 = Angle 6.
- Angles 3 and 7 are alternate interior angles formed by diagonal CD and parallel lines AD and BC. Therefore, Angle 3 = Angle 7.
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle. Angle DAB is a right angle.
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle. Angle ABC is a right angle.
- Triangle BCD is a right triangle. Angle BCD is a right angle.
- Triangle CDA is a right triangle. Angle CDA is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle 2 is given as 40 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of angle 3.
- Angle DAB is a right angle, so its measure is 90 degrees.
- Angle DAB = Angle 1 + Angle 2, so 90 = Angle 1 + 40, which means Angle 1 = 50 degrees.
- Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, triangle AEB is isosceles, meaning AE=BE, and angles 1 and 6 are congruent. Since Angles 2 and 6 are congruent, therefore Angle 6=40.
- Similarly triangle BEC is isosceles, so BE=CE, therefore the base angles 4 and 7 are congruent.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of angle 3.
- Angle ADB is supplementary with Angle CDB. Angle ADB = Angle 3 + 90 = 180. Therefore Angle 3 + 90 = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the rectangle.
- We need to define the points, lines, and angles.
- We need to specify that m \angle 2 = 40.
- We need to specify the right angles in the rectangle.
- We need to specify that opposite sides are parallel.
