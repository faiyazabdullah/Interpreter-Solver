PROBLEM 2864 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Express the ratio of \cos N as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle NPM with vertices labeled N, P, M
- Side NP is marked as 15 units
- Side PM is marked as 36 units
- Side NM is marked as 39 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex P

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle NPM is a right triangle with right angle at P
- Sides NP and PM are perpendicular
- Side NM is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- NP = 15 units (given)
- PM = 36 units (given)
- NM = 39 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of cos N
- This requires using trigonometric ratios
- cos N = Adjacent/Hypotenuse

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Need predicates to specify the side adjacent to angle N and the hypotenuse
- Need to create a predicate to define CosOf(Angle(N))
