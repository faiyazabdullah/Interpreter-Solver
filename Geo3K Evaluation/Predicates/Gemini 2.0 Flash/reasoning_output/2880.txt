PROBLEM 2880 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot P, m \angle M P L = 65 and N P \perp P L. Find m \widehat N J K.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center P.
- There are points J, K, L, M, and N on the circle.
- There are line segments PJ, PK, PL, PM, and PN.
- There is a right angle symbol at angle NPL.
- The measure of angle MPL is given as 65 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since all points lie on the circle centered at P, line segments PJ, PK, PL, PM, and PN are radii of the circle and thus congruent.
- Line segment NP is perpendicular to line segment PL.
- Angles NPL and MPL are central angles of the circle.
- Arcs NJ, JK, KL, LM, MN are arcs of the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle MPL = 65 degrees
- NP \perp PL implies m \angle NPL = 90 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the measure of arc NJK.
- This is equivalent to finding the measure of central angle NPK + angle KPJ
- To find the measure of arc NJK, we need to find the measure of angles NPL, LPK and KPJ

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and the points on it.
- Represent the line segments (radii).
- Represent the perpendicularity and the angle measurements.
- Represent the congruence of the radii.
- The measure of arc NJK is the sum of the central angles that subtend it, which are angles NPL, LPK, and KPJ.
