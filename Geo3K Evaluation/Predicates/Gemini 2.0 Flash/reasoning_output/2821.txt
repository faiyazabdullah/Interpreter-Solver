PROBLEM 2821 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral A B C D is a rhombus. If A B = 2 x + 3 and B C = x + 7, find C D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD.
- The quadrilateral is labeled as a rhombus.
- The sides AB and BC are labeled as 2x + 3 and x + 7, respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, all four sides are congruent.
- Therefore, AB = BC = CD = DA.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2x + 3
- BC = x + 7
- We are asked to find CD

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of side CD of the rhombus.
- We are given expressions for sides AB and BC.
- Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, we can set up an equation to solve for x and thus determine the length of each side, including CD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, that it is a rhombus, and the given expressions for AB and BC.
- We need to state that all sides are equal.
