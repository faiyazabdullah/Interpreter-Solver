PROBLEM 2454 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is labeled as x units.
- Side BC is the adjacent side to the 17-degree angle at vertex B
- Side AC is the opposite side to the 17-degree angle at vertex B
- Side BC has a length of 9.7
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.
- Angle ABC measures 17 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at A.
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular.
- Side BC is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BC = 9.7 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 17 degrees (given)
- The angle at A measures 90 degrees
- Length of AB = x, which we want to find

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of side AB.
- We can use trigonometric ratios (cosine) to relate the known and unknown sides with the given angle.
- cos(17) = adjacent/hypotenuse = x/9.7

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, angle, and cosine relationship.
