PROBLEM 2422 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the length of \widehat A B. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- There are points A, B, and D on the circle.
- Line AD is a diameter of the circle, and passes through O.
- There is an angle AOB, with a measure of 80 degrees.
- The diameter AD is labeled as 14 m.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- OA and OB are radii of the circle.
- The diameter AD is twice the radius.
- Angle AOB is a central angle intercepting arc AB.
- I need to find the length of arc AB.
- The length of arc AB is a fraction of the circumference of the circle, proportional to the central angle AOB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Diameter of the circle is 14 m.
- Radius of the circle is 14/2 = 7 m.
- Angle AOB measures 80 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of arc AB.
- The length of the arc is a fraction of the circle's circumference.
- This fraction is the central angle (80) divided by 360.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the circle, points, angle, diameter, radius, and arc.
- I need to represent the relationships between them.
- I need to calculate the circumference using the diameter.
- I need to express that the arc length is a fraction of the circumference.
