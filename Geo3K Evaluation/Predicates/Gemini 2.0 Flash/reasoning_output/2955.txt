PROBLEM 2955 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \angle 6 and \angle 8 are complementary, m \angle 8 = 47. Find the measure of \angle 7.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points A, B, C, D, and E.
- I can identify line segments BA, BE, BC, and BD.
- The values 6, 7, and 8 are associated with line segments BE, BA, BC, and BD respectively.
- Angles 6 and 8 are at point B.
- Angles 6 and 8 are complementary.
- The measure of angle 8 is 47 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line CD is a straight line, so angle CBD is a straight angle and measures 180 degrees.
- Angle 6 is the angle between BE and BC.
- Angle 7 is the angle between BE and BA.
- Angle 8 is the angle between BD and BA.
- The problem states angles 6 and 8 are complementary, therefore angle 6 + angle 8 = 90.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BE = 6
- Length of BA = 7
- Length of BD = 8
- m<8 = 47

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 7.
- Complementary angles add up to 90.
- Since angle 6 and 8 are complementary, angle 6 = 90 - angle 8 = 90 - 47 = 43
- We need to find measure of angle 7, it is not immediately obvious how.
- The diagram shows four rays originating at point B: BC, BE, BA, and BD, forming angles 6, 7, and 8. However, the values associated with the lines are lengths, not angle measures. Also, there is no indication that angles 6 and 7, or 7 and 8 are related, and there is no relationship defined regarding 7 except it is adjacent to the complementary pair 6 and 8. So, while angle 6 + angle 8 = 90 degrees and angle 8 = 47, we cannot determine the measure of angle 7 from the provided information.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent points, lines, and angles.
- Represent the given measurements.
- Represent the complementary relationship between angles 6 and 8.
- Indicate angle measures as MeasureOf(Angle(X)) = value.
