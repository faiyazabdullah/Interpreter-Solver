================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 3 in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify several points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- I can identify several line segments: DB, BC, BF, FG, GE, AE, GH.
- I can identify several angles: Angle at D (50 degrees), Angle at C (78 degrees), Angle 1, Angle 2, Angle 3, Angle 4, Angle 5, Angle BGC (120 degrees), Angle AEG (56 degrees).
- I can identify triangles: Triangle DBC, Triangle BFG, Triangle AEG.
- Line segment DBEH is a straight line.
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are supplementary.
- Angle BGC and Angle 4 are supplementary.
- Angle AEG and Angle 5 are supplementary.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since DBEH is a straight line, Angle 1 and Angle CBH form a linear pair, therefore, their sum is 180 degrees. Similarly, Angle 4 and Angle FGE form a linear pair, therefore, their sum is 180 degrees. Lastly, Angle 5 and Angle AEG form a linear pair, therefore, their sum is 180 degrees.
- The sum of angles in Triangle DBC is 180 degrees.
- The sum of angles in Triangle BFG is 180 degrees.
- The sum of angles in Triangle AEG is 180 degrees.
- Angles 1 and 2 are supplementary, Angle BGC and Angle 4 are supplementary, Angle AEG and Angle 5 are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle D is 50 degrees.
- Measure of angle C is 78 degrees.
- Measure of angle BGC is 120 degrees.
- Measure of angle A is 56 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 3.
- Angle 3 is part of triangle BFG. We know Angle FBG (Angle 2) and Angle FGB (supplement of Angle BGC).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all shapes and angles.
- Represent the supplementary angles.
- Represent the sum of angles in triangle BFG.
- Relate measurements to the diagram.
