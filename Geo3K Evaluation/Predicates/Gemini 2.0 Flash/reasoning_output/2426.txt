PROBLEM 2426 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For the pair of similar figures, use the given areas to find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two rectangles. Let's call the first rectangle R1 and the second rectangle R2
- R1 has a width of 4 inches. The area of R1 is 8 square inches.
- R2 has a length of x inches. The area of R2 is 32 square inches.
- The vertices of rectangle R2 are labeled A, B, C, and D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- R1 and R2 are similar rectangles.
- Area of a rectangle is calculated as length * width.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Width of R1 = 4 inches
- Area of R1 = 8 square inches
- Length of R2 = x inches
- Area of R2 = 32 square inches
- It can be assumed the heights of both rectangles are needed.
- height of R1 = area / width = 8 / 4 = 2 inches
- The sides of R2 must be calculated using similarity and area.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of 'x' using the given areas and the fact that the rectangles are similar.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define shapes, lengths, areas.
- Define similar relationship between the rectangles.
