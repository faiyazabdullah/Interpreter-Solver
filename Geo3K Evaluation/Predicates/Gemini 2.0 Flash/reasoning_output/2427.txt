PROBLEM 2427 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AC is marked as 5 units.
- Side BC is marked as x.
- Side AC is marked as 3√2 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 3√2 units (given)
- AB = 5 units (given)
- BC = x units (unknown)
- The question asks for the value of x.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x which is the length of side BC
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side.
- We need to establish the relationship between the sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include the Pythagorean relationship for solving.
