PROBLEM 2665 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles. Let's call the triangle on the left Triangle ABC and the triangle on the right Triangle DEF, although the point D, E, and F aren't explicitly labeled.
- Triangle ABC has side AC = 12, side BC = 20, side AB = 2x.
- Triangle DEF has side DE = y+4, side EF = 15, side DF = 12.
- The angles in triangle ABC at vertices A, B, and C are congruent to the angles in triangle DEF at vertices D, E, and F respectively.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the angles are congruent, the two triangles are similar.
- Corresponding sides are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 12, BC = 20, AB = 2x, DE = y+4, EF = 15, DF = 12.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We will use the fact that the triangles are similar, and therefore corresponding sides are proportional. We will use this to set up an equation and solve for x.
