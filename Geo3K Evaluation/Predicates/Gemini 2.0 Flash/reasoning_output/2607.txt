PROBLEM 2607 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: Triangle ABE and Triangle DBC
- Point A, B, E, C, D are labeled in the image
- Length of line segment AB is labeled as x + 3
- Length of line segment BE is labeled as 5
- Length of line segment DB is labeled as 3
- Length of line segment BC is labeled as 2x - 8
- AE is parallel to DC because of the arrows indicating the direction of lines AE and DC
- Angle ABE and Angle DBC are vertical angles and therefore congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABE and Triangle DBC are similar because they have two equal angles: the vertical angles at B and because AE and DC are parallel, Angle BAE is congruent to Angle BCD (alternate interior angles).
- Since the triangles are similar, their sides are proportional: AB/BC = BE/BD = AE/DC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = x + 3
- BE = 5
- DB = 3
- BC = 2x - 8
- I need to find the value of x to determine the length of BC.
- Using the similarity of the two triangles, AB/BC = BE/BD
- Substituting the values, (x+3)/(2x-8) = 5/3

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BC.
- This requires finding the value of x and then substituting it into the expression for BC (2x - 8)
- I must use the similar triangle relationships to determine the value of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines, and triangles
- Represent the given lengths
- Represent the parallel lines AE and DC
- Represent the similarity of triangles ABE and DBC
- Represent the proportion of the sides of similar triangles
