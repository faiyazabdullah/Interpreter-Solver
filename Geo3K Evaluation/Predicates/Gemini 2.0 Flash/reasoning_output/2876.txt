PROBLEM 2876 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of \triangle D E F, if \triangle D E F \sim \triangle C B F, perimeter of \triangle C B F = 27, D F = 6, and F C = 8.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: DEF and CBF.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, and F are labeled.
- Lines AD, AE, DE, BC, BF, CF, EF, DF are present.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle DEF is similar to triangle CBF.
- Perimeter of triangle CBF is given as 27.
- DF = 6 and FC = 8 are given.
- Since triangles DEF and CBF are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Perimeter of triangle CBF = 27
- Length of DF = 6
- Length of FC = 8

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of triangle DEF.
- Since the triangles are similar and we have the lengths of corresponding sides DF and FC, we can find the ratio of similarity between the two triangles and use this ratio to relate the perimeter of triangle CBF to the perimeter of triangle DEF.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangles, their vertices and sides.
- Specify that triangle DEF is similar to triangle CBF.
- Give the length of DF and FC.
- Give the perimeter of triangle CBF.
- Define the ratio of corresponding sides and perimeters.
