PROBLEM 2991 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m \angle B A C = 38, B C = 5, and D C = 5, find m \angle D A C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, and D.
- I can see lines AC, AB, AD.
- I can see rays BF, CG, and DE.
- I can see that BC is perpendicular to BF.
- I can see that DC is perpendicular to DE.
- I am given the measure of angle BAC is 38.
- I am given the length of BC is 5.
- I am given the length of DC is 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle BAC is 38 degrees.
- BC is perpendicular to AB.
- DC is perpendicular to AD.
- BC = DC = 5

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle B A C = 38
- B C = 5
- D C = 5

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find m \angle D A C

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- List all the points, lines, and angles.
- Show Perpendicular relationships
- Show the given angle and lengths.
