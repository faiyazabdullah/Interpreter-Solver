PROBLEM 2827 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In rhombus A B C D, m \angle D A B = 2, m \angle A D C and C B = 6. Find m \angle A D B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus ABCD.
- Point E is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.
- CB has a length of 6.
- Angle DAB has a measure of 2.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rhombus, meaning all sides are equal in length, opposite sides are parallel, and diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
- Since ABCD is a rhombus, AB=BC=CD=DA.
- Diagonals AC and BD bisect angles DAB, ADC, BCD, and CBA respectively.
- Diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular.
- m \angle DAB = 2 is most likely a typo and stands for a measurement which we will designate as variable 'x'.
- Angle ADC is supplementary to angle DAB.
- Since the diagonals bisect the angles, angle ADB is half of angle ADC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CB = 6, so AB=BC=CD=DA=6.
- m \angle DAB = x (where x is the variable denoting the angle measurement).

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle ADB.
- We need to find the measure of angle ADC, and then halve it to get the measure of angle ADB.
- Since angles DAB and ADC are supplementary, we can find angle ADC in terms of x, which would be 180-x. Then angle ADB is equal to (180-x)/2 = 90 - x/2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, the equality of sides, the angle relationship, supplementary angles, and diagonal properties.
