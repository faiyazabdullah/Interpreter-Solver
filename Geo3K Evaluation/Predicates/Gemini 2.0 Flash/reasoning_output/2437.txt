PROBLEM 2437 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle V X W.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center X.
- There are four points on the circle: Y, Z, V, W.
- There are two diameters: YXV and ZXW.
- m arc YZ = (4x + 15)°
- m arc VW = (2x + 65)°

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- YXV and ZXW are diameters so they are straight lines passing through the center X.
- Arcs YZ and VW are intercepted arcs of central angles YXZ and VXW, respectively.
- The central angles are equal to the measures of their intercepted arcs:
  -  m ∠YXZ = m arc YZ
  -  m ∠VXW = m arc VW
- ∠YXZ and ∠VXW are vertical angles, so they are equal in measure.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m arc YZ = (4x + 15)°
- m arc VW = (2x + 65)°
- Since ∠YXZ and ∠VXW are vertical angles and their measures are equal to the arc measures, we can set the arc measures equal to each other:
(4x + 15) = (2x + 65)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of ∠VXW.
- Since m ∠VXW = m arc VW = (2x + 65)°, we need to find the value of x.
- From the equation (4x + 15) = (2x + 65), we can solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, center, points on the circle, and arcs.
- Represent the diameters.
- Represent the measures of the arcs.
- Represent the central angles.
- Express the relationship that the measures of the vertical angles are equal.
