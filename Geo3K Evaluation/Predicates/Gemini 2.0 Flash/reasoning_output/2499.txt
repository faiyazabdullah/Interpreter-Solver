PROBLEM 2499 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AC is marked as 7 units
- Side AB is marked as y units
- Side BC is marked as x units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A
- Angle ABC is labeled as 30 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at A.
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular.
- Side BC is the hypotenuse.
- Angle ABC is 30 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 7 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 30 degrees (given)
- AB = y units
- BC = x units
- The question asks for x.
- This triangle has a right angle and one angle is 30 degrees. This makes the remaining angle 60 degrees (angle ACB).
- We can use trigonometry to determine the side lengths.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BC which is x.
- This requires using trigonometry (sine, cosine, tangent) to determine x.
- Since we know the length of AC and angle ABC we can use sine to find x.
- Sin(30) = AC / BC
- Sin(30) = 7 / x

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Need to use sin(30) = 7/x
- Need to find x
