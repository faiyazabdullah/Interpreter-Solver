PROBLEM 2775 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral labeled ABCD.
- The length of side AD is labeled 5y.
- The length of side AB is labeled 2x - 5.
- The length of side BC is labeled 2y + 12.
- The length of side CD is labeled 3x - 18.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The question implies that ABCD is a parallelogram when x is found.
- For ABCD to be a parallelogram, opposite sides must be equal in length: AD = BC and AB = CD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 5y
- BC = 2y + 12
- AB = 2x - 5
- CD = 3x - 18

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x such that ABCD is a parallelogram.
- This implies setting up equations based on the properties of a parallelogram: opposite sides are equal.
- Setting up the equations: 5y = 2y + 12 and 2x - 5 = 3x - 18. The second equation only involves x and can be solved for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the quadrilateral ABCD.
- Represent the lengths of the sides.
- Represent the relationships between the sides for a parallelogram.
