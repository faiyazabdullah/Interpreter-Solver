PROBLEM 2875 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find P S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle PQS with vertices labeled P, Q, S.
- Point R lies on line segment SQ.
- Line PR is perpendicular to line SQ, forming a right angle at R.
- SQ is divided into two segments, SR and RQ, both with length 7.
- PQ has length 9.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle PRS and Triangle PRQ are right triangles
- PR is an altitude of triangle PQS
- SR and RQ are congruent

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- SR = 7 units
- RQ = 7 units
- PQ = 9 units

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of PS.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle PRS.
- We need to find PR first, using Pythagorean theorem on triangle PRQ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- Indicate perpendicularity.
- Represent given measurements.
- Express that the length of SR is equal to RQ.
- Set up Pythagorean theorem relationships for both right triangles.
