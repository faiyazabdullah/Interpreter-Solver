PROBLEM 2593 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the side length in isosceles triangle D E F.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle DEF with vertices labeled D, E, F.
- Side DE is marked as 10x cm.
- Side DF is marked as (8.5x + 3) cm.
- Side EF is marked as (3.5x + 4) cm.
- There are congruence markings on sides DE and DF.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle DEF is an isosceles triangle because sides DE and DF are congruent.
- This means that the lengths of sides DE and DF are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DE = 10x cm
- DF = (8.5x + 3) cm
- EF = (3.5x + 4) cm
- Since DE and DF are congruent, 10x = 8.5x + 3. We can solve for x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the side length of the isosceles triangle DEF.
- Since it is an isosceles triangle, DE = DF.
- Need to find the value of x, and then find the lengths of sides DE and DF.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, congruence of sides, and measurements.
- We need to express the equality of side lengths based on the congruence marks.
- We need to be able to relate sides DE and DF
