PROBLEM 2470 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In rhombus L M P Q, m \angle Q L M = 2 x^ { 2 } - 10, m \angle Q P M = 8 x, and M P = 10. Find the perimeter of L M P Q.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rhombus L M P Q with vertices labeled L, M, P, Q
- Length of MP is labeled as 10
- Angle QLM is labeled as 2x^2 - 10
- Angle QPM is labeled as 8x

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- L M P Q is a rhombus, so all sides are equal in length
- Opposite angles of a rhombus are equal. Therefore, angle QLM is equal to angle QPM
- The perimeter of a rhombus is four times the length of one side. Since MP = 10, then LM = MP = PQ = QL = 10
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
- Diagonals bisect the angles of a rhombus.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MP = 10
- Angle QLM = 2x^2 - 10
- Angle QPM = 8x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of rhombus L M P Q
- Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal.
- Given MP = 10, then all sides are 10.
- Perimeter = 4 * side = 4 * 10 = 40

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the rhombus L M P Q
- State the length of M P
- State the measure of angle Q L M
- State the measure of angle Q P M
- State the equality of opposite angles: Angle QLM = Angle QPM
- Relate the sides of a rhombus, namely LM = MP = PQ = QL
- Calculate the perimeter as 4 * LM
