PROBLEM 2940 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot X, A B = 30, C D = 30, and m \widehat C Z = 40. Find m \widehat C D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center X.
- Points A, B, C, D, Y, Z are on the circle.
- Line segments AB and CD are chords of the circle.
- M is the midpoint of AB, and Line XM is perpendicular to AB.
- N is the midpoint of CD, and Line XN is perpendicular to CD.
- Arc CZ is part of the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AB and CD are chords of the circle.
- XM is perpendicular to AB, so XM bisects AB.
- XN is perpendicular to CD, so XN bisects CD.
- AB = CD, so arcs AB and CD are congruent.
- Arcs are related to central angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 30
- CD = 30
- m(arc CZ) = 40

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m(arc CD)
- m(arc CD) = m(arc CZ) + m(arc ZD)
- Since AB = CD, m(arc AB) = m(arc CD)
- Need to find m(arc ZD)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, and arcs.
- Represent the given measurements.
- Establish relationships between chords, arcs, and central angles.
