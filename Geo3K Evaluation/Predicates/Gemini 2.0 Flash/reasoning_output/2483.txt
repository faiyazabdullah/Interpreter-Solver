PROBLEM 2483 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find Q P.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle MPO with vertices labeled M, P, O.
- There is a line QN inside the triangle.
- Line QN is parallel to line PO.
- The length of MQ is 5.
- The length of MN is 6.
- The length of NO is 3 3/5, which is equivalent to 3.6 or 18/5.
- The length of QP is x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle MQN is similar to triangle MPO because QN is parallel to PO.
- Because the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MQ = 5
- MN = 6
- NO = 3.6
- QP = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of QP.
- Since triangle MQN is similar to triangle MPO, MQ/MP = MN/MO
- MP = MQ + QP = 5 + x
- MO = MN + NO = 6 + 3.6 = 9.6

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, and triangles.
- State that the lines are parallel.
- Express the measurements that are given.
- Establish the similarity of the triangles.
- State that the ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles are equal.
