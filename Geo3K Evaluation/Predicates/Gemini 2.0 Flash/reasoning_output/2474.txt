PROBLEM 2474 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: parallelogram M N P Q with m \angle M = 10 x and m \angle N = 20 x, find \angle M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral MNPQ.
- It is labeled as a parallelogram.
- Angle M is marked as 10x.
- Angle N is marked as 20x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral MNPQ is a parallelogram, therefore opposite sides are parallel.
- In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to 180 degrees).
- Therefore, angle M + angle N = 180.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle M = 10x
- m \angle N = 20x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle M.
- We can use the supplementary angle property to set up an equation and solve for x.
- Then, we can substitute the value of x back into 10x to find the measure of angle M.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the parallelogram.
- Define the angles M and N and their measures in terms of x.
- Express the supplementary relationship between adjacent angles.
- Include the property of supplementary angles that the sum is 180 degrees.
