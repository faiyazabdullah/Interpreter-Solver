PROBLEM 2820 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- Point B lies on the circumference of the circle.
- The line segment AB is labeled as 4 in.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AB is the radius of the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of the radius AB is 4 inches.
- The question is asking for the area of the circle.
- Area of a circle is πr^2.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the area of the circle.
- We know the radius is 4 inches.
- Area = π * 4^2 = 16π

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and points
- Define the radius
- Define the length of the radius
- State the area of the circle in terms of the radius
- Do NOT include any predicates that calculate the final answer
