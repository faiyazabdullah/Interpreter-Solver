PROBLEM 2767 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- There are points A, C, and D on the circumference of the circle.
- There are lines BA, BC, and BD.
- Angle ABC is labeled as 65 degrees.
- Angle CBD is labeled as 132 degrees.
- Angle ABD is labeled as x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, C, and D lie on the circle centered at B.
- BA, BC, and BD are radii of the circle, and thus are congruent.
- The angles ABC, CBD, and ABD are angles formed at the center of the circle.
- The sum of angles ABC, CBD, and ABD makes up the total angle around point B.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is 65 degrees.
- Angle CBD is 132 degrees.
- Angle ABD is x degrees.
- The sum of the angles around point B is 360 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x, which is the measure of angle ABD.
- The sum of the angles ABC, CBD, and ABD equals 360 degrees.
- Therefore, x + 65 + 132 = 360.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, center, points on the circle, angles and their measures.
- The main relationship is the sum of the angles around the center B.
