PROBLEM 2662 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: H K and I G are diameters of \odot L. Find m \widehat I H J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center L.
- Points H, I, G, J, and K lie on the circle.
- Segments HI and IG are diameters.
- Angle HL I is 59 degrees.
- Angle JL I is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since HI and IG are diameters, point L is the center of the circle.
- Angle JL I is a right angle, meaning it measures 90 degrees.
- I need to find the measure of arc IHJ. Arc IHJ is composed of arc IH and arc HJ.
- The measure of arc IH is the same as the measure of central angle HL I, which is 59 degrees.
- Angle JL I is 90 degrees, so angle JLH is 180 - 90 = 90. The central angle corresponding to arc J, so that arc is 90. Therefore the measure of arc HJ is also equal to the measure of central angle HLJ.
- Therefore m \widehat IHJ = m\widehat IH + m \widehat HJ

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle HL I = 59 degrees
- Angle JL I = 90 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc IHJ.
- I need to find the measure of arc IH and arc HJ, and then add them together.
- I know the measure of central angle HL I, which is the same as the measure of arc IH.
- I know that angle JL I is a right angle (90 degrees).
- I need to find the measure of angle HLJ or arc HJ

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles, and the circle.
- Note the given angle measurements.
- State that HI and IG are diameters.
- Relate the arc measures to their corresponding central angle measures.
