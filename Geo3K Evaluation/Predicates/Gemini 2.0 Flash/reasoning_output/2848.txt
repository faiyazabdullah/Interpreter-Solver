PROBLEM 2848 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three horizontal lines, which appear to be parallel.
- I can see two lines intersecting the parallel lines.
- I can see points labeled B, I, F, C, O, P, N, H, G, D, A, L, E, K, J, M
- I can see the expression 12-3y
- I can see the expression 16-5y
- I can see the expression 1/4x + 6
- I can see the expression 2x-29

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The lines BI, OP, and GL are parallel.
- The angles formed by the intersecting lines and the parallel lines are corresponding angles.
- Since the lines BI, OP, and GL are parallel, then the ratios of the line segments formed by the transversal are equal.
- The segments IP and DA are of equal length (indicated by the matching tick marks)
- The segments IF and NA are related to x.
- The segments BI and OP are related to y.
- The segments GL and OP are related to y.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BI = 12 - 3y
- Length of OP = 16 - 5y
- Length of IF = 1/4x + 6
- Length of NA = 2x - 29
- Length of IP = Length of DA

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find y.
- IP = DA; therefore, the distance between the lines are the same
- So, we can set up the following equation: 12-3y = 16-5y
- Once the equation is setup, you can solve it.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define points and lines.
- Need to define parallel relationships
- Need to define segment equality
- Need to define the given numerical expressions
