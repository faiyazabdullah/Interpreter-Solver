PROBLEM 2853 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50, find \cos A.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side a (BC) is marked as 14 units
- Side b (AC) is marked as 48 units
- Side c (AB) is marked as 50 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- a = Length of BC = 14 units (given)
- b = Length of AC = 48 units (given)
- c = Length of AB = 50 units (given)
- Need to find the cosine of angle A.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the cosine of angle A
- cos A = adjacent / hypotenuse
- adjacent to angle A is AC, with length b
- hypotenuse is AB, with length c
- cos A = b/c

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include the cosine formula and the given measurements to compute cos A
