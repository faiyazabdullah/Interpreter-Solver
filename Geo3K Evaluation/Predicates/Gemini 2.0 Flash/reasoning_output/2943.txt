PROBLEM 2943 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle A F D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- There is a point F in the interior of the quadrilateral.
- Line segments AC and BD intersect at point F.
- I can see the following angles: Angle DAF = 49°, Angle ADF = 34°, Angle BCD = 54°.
- I can see the lengths of AD = 29, CD = 25, BC = 3y - 4, and AB = 5x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure appears to be a parallelogram because opposite sides are parallel.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. Thus AB = CD and AD = BC.
- The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. So AF = FC and BF = FD.
- I need to find angle AFD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 29, CD = 25, BC = 3y - 4, and AB = 5x.
- Angle DAF = 49°, Angle ADF = 34°, Angle BCD = 54°.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, angle DAB = angle BCD.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle AFD.
- Angle AFD is an interior angle of triangle AFD.
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle AFD = 180° - (angle DAF + angle ADF).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, parallelogram, points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Need to represent that the opposite sides of the parallelogram are equal.
- Need to represent that the diagonals bisect each other.
- Need to express the relationship between the angles in triangle AFD.
