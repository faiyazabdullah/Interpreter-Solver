PROBLEM 2621 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find S T.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle STR with vertices labeled S, T, R
- Side ST is labeled as 12 + x
- Side SR is labeled as 4x - 4
- Side TR is labeled as 3x + 3
- Sides SR and TR are marked as congruent

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle STR is a triangle with vertices S, T, R
- Sides SR and TR are congruent, implying that the triangle is isosceles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ST = 12 + x
- SR = 4x - 4
- TR = 3x + 3
- SR = TR since they are congruent

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of ST.
- We need to find the value of x and substitute it into the expression for ST.
- We can use the fact that SR = TR to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, vertices, side lengths, and congruence of SR and TR.
- Need to equate SR and TR to solve for x.
- Then use x value to solve for ST.
