PROBLEM 2462 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A B is a diameter, A C = 8 inches, and B C = 15 inches. Find the radius of the circle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center D
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle
- Line segment AB is a diameter of the circle
- Line segment AC connects point A to point C on the circle
- Line segment BC connects point B to point C on the circle
- Angle ACB is inscribed in the circle
- The length of AC is given as 8 inches
- The length of BC is given as 15 inches

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AB is a diameter, angle ACB is a right angle (inscribed angle subtending a diameter)
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with hypotenuse AB
- The radius of the circle is half the length of the diameter AB

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(AC) = 8 inches
- LengthOf(BC) = 15 inches
- We need to find the radius of the circle, which is half the length of AB

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the radius of the circle
- This requires finding the length of the diameter AB
- We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AB

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need predicates for: the points, circle, lines, triangle, right angle, measurements, diameter, and the Pythagorean relationship.
