PROBLEM 2758 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Trapezoid G H J K has an area of 75 square meters. Find the height.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral GHJK.
- The quadrilateral looks like a trapezoid with bases GH and KJ.
- The length of GH is given as 17 m.
- The length of KJ is given as 13 m.
- The area of trapezoid GHJK is given as 75 square meters.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- GHJK is a trapezoid.
- GH and KJ are bases of trapezoid GHJK, so they are parallel to each other.
- The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between bases GH and KJ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of GH = 17 m
- Length of KJ = 13 m
- Area of trapezoid GHJK = 75 square meters

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the height of trapezoid GHJK.
- The area of a trapezoid is given by (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height.
- So, Area = (1/2) * (GH + KJ) * height
- We know the area and the lengths of GH and KJ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent that GHJK is a trapezoid.
- Need to represent the given lengths of GH and KJ.
- Need to represent the given area of GHJK.
- Need to represent the bases.
- Need to represent the formula for the area of a trapezoid in terms of its bases and height.
- HeightOf(Trapezoid(GHJK))
