PROBLEM 2791 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find a, if F G = 18, G H = 42, and F K = 15.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- There are two lines F H and F J that intersect the circle at G, H and K, J respectively.
- The lengths of the segments F G, G H, and F K are given.
- The length of K J is represented by the variable a.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- FH and FJ are secants to the circle.
- By the power of a point theorem (specifically, the secant-secant power theorem), F G * F H = F K * F J.
- F H = F G + G H and F J = F K + K J, so we can substitute these into the power of a point equation.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- F G = 18
- G H = 42
- F K = 15
- K J = a

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We want to find the value of 'a', which represents the length of the segment K J.
- We have all the information to apply the secant-secant power theorem.
- F G * F H = F K * F J translates to 18 * (18 + 42) = 15 * (15 + a).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, lines, and segment lengths.
- Need to define the secant segments.
- Need to represent the power of a point theorem relationship.
