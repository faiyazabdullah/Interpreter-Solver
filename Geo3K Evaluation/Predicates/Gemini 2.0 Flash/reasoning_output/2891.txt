PROBLEM 2891 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot B, C E = 13.5. Find B D. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B
- There are points A, B, C, D, E, F on the figure
- Line segment AF is a diameter of the circle
- Line segment CE is a chord of the circle
- Line segment BD is perpendicular to CE
- The length of AB is 8

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- B is the center of the circle
- AB and BF are radii of the circle
- CE is a chord of the circle
- BD is perpendicular to CE
- D is the midpoint of CE because BD is perpendicular to CE
- Since D is the midpoint of CE, CD = DE
- CE = CD + DE = 2 * CD

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The length of AB is 8
- Since AB is a radius, the radius of the circle is 8
- Since AF is a diameter, the length of AF is 16
- The length of CE is 13.5

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BD
- I know the radius of the circle is 8
- Let BD = x, then BF = radius = 8, thus DF = 8 - x
- Since CE = 13.5 and D is the midpoint of CE, then DE = 13.5/2 = 6.75
- In the right triangle BDE, BD^2 + DE^2 = BE^2
- BE is the radius, so BE = 8
- x^2 + 6.75^2 = 8^2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the circle, points, lines
- Need to specify the radius
- Need to specify that CE is a chord
- Need to specify BD is perpendicular to CE
- Need to specify D is the midpoint of CE
- Need to specify CE = 13.5
