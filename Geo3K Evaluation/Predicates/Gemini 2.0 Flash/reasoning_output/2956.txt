PROBLEM 2956 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles ABE and CDE.
- The points are labeled as A, B, C, D, and E.
- Line segments AE, BE, CE, and DE are present.
- The length of AE is given as 5.
- The length of CE is given as 8.
- The length of DE is given as 10.
- The length of AB is labeled as x.
- Angle AEB and angle CED are congruent.
- Angle BAE and angle DCE are congruent

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles ABE and CDE are similar by AA similarity (Angle-Angle Similarity) since angle AEB is congruent to angle CED (vertical angles) and angle BAE is congruent to angle DCE.
- Since the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AE = 5
- CE = 8
- DE = 10
- AB = x (unknown)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking for the length of AB, which is represented by x.
- Since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides can be used to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, and triangles.
- Indicate the congruent angles.
- State the similarity of the two triangles.
- Represent the measurements.
- State the proportionality of the sides of similar triangles.
