PROBLEM 2918 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that G J \parallel F K. G H = x + 3.5, H J = x - 8.5, F H = 21, H K = 7.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle FHK with vertices labeled F, H, K
- There is a line GJ intersecting sides FH and HK at points G and J respectively.
- G, J are on FH, HK, respectively.
- GJ is parallel to FK
- The following lengths are labeled: GH = x + 3.5, HJ = x - 8.5, FH = 21, HK = 7

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle FHK exists
- Point G lies on FH
- Point J lies on HK
- Line GJ is parallel to line FK
- By Triangle Proportionality Theorem, if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. So, if GJ is parallel to FK, then HG/GF = HJ/JK. Also, HG/HF = HJ/HK

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of GH is given as x + 3.5
- Length of HJ is given as x - 8.5
- Length of FH is given as 21
- Length of HK is given as 7
- GF = FH - GH = 21 - (x + 3.5) = 17.5 - x
- JK = HK - HJ = 7 - (x - 8.5) = 15.5 - x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x such that GJ is parallel to FK
- We can use the property that if GJ is parallel to FK, then HG/HF = HJ/HK

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the triangle, points, and lines.
- Need to define the parallel relationship between the lines.
- Need to include the lengths of the line segments.
- Need to state the relationship HG/HF = HJ/HK
