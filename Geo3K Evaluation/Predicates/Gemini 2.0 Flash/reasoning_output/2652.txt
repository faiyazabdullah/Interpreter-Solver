PROBLEM 2652 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: a = 14, b = 48, and c = 50, find \sin A.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side BC is labeled as a and its length is 14
- Side AC is labeled as b and its length is 48
- Side AB is labeled as c and its length is 50
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- a = 14 units (given)
- b = 48 units (given)
- c = 50 units (given)
- I need to find sin A.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of sin A.
- In a right triangle, sin A = opposite / hypotenuse = a / c
- I need to use the given side lengths to calculate this ratio.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- I will need predicates to represent the sides and the fact that it's a right triangle
