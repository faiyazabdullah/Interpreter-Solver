PROBLEM 2429 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram labeled ABCD.
- Point E is the foot of the perpendicular from point B to line AD.
- The length of side CB is labeled as 14 mm.
- The length of segment ED is labeled as 7 mm.
- The measure of angle ADC is labeled as 60 degrees.
- Angle BEA is marked as a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram.
- BE is perpendicular to AD, forming a right angle at E.
- CB and AD are parallel and have equal lengths.
- AB and CD are parallel and have equal lengths.
- Angle ADC and angle ABC are equal.
- Angle BAD and angle BCD are equal.
- BE is the height of the parallelogram with respect to base AD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of CB = 14 mm, therefore length of AD = 14 mm.
- Length of ED = 7 mm.
- Angle ADC = 60 degrees.
- Angle BEA is a right angle.
- We can find the height of the parallelogram (BE) using trigonometric relationships in triangle BED.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram ABCD.
- Area of a parallelogram = base * height
- Base AD = 14 mm
- Need to find the height BE.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram, points, lines, and angles.
- Represent the measurements of the sides and angles.
- Represent the right angle.
- Establish that opposite sides of the parallelogram are equal and parallel.
- Establish the trigonometric relationship to find BE using the sine function.
