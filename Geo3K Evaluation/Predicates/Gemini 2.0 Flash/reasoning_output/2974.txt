PROBLEM 2974 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: P Q R S is a rhombus inscribed in a circle. Find m \widehat S P.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center C.
- I can see four points P, Q, R, and S on the circle.
- I can see a quadrilateral PQRS.
- I can see that PQRS is a rhombus.
- The question asks for the measure of arc SP.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since PQRS is a rhombus, all its sides are congruent: PQ = QR = RS = SP.
- Since PQRS is inscribed in a circle, it is a cyclic quadrilateral.
- Since PQRS is a rhombus and is inscribed in a circle, it must be a square.
- Because PQRS is a square, the angles at P, Q, R, and S are all right angles.
- Since the sides are equal, the arcs are equal: arc PQ = arc QR = arc RS = arc SP.
- The sum of the arcs is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We know that all the arcs are equal.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of arc SP.
- Since PQRS is a square, all the arcs are equal and their sum is 360 degrees, so each arc is 90 degrees.
- The question asks for the measure of arc SP.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all the points, shapes, and their relationships.
- Express the fact that the arcs are equal.
- Represent the fact that the quadrilateral is a rhombus and a square.
