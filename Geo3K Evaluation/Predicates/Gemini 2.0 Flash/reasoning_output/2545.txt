PROBLEM 2545 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a large semicircle with diameter AE.
- Three smaller semicircles are inscribed inside the larger semicircle with diameters AF, FG, and GE respectively.
- Points A, F, C, G, and E lie on a line.
- The length of AE is 15.
- The shaded region is the area inside the large semicircle but outside the three smaller semicircles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AF + FG + GE = AE
- The three smaller semicircles are tangent to the diameter AE.
- The three smaller semicircles are inside the larger semicircle.
- The diameters of the three smaller circles add up to the diameter of the larger semicircle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AE = 15
- I need to find the area of the shaded region.
- The area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the large semicircle minus the areas of the three smaller semicircles.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking for the area of the shaded region.
- The area of the shaded region is equal to the area of the large semicircle minus the areas of the three smaller semicircles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I will represent the large semicircle.
- I will represent the three smaller semicircles.
- I will represent that the points A, F, C, G and E lie on a line.
- I will represent that AF+FG+GE = AE
- I will represent that the area of shaded region is the area of large semicircle minus the areas of the three smaller semicircles.
