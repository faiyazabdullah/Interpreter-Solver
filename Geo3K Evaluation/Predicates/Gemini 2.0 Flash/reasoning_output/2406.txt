PROBLEM 2406 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of x in the diagram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points labeled B, C, D, I, E, F, G, and H.
- There are lines connecting the points as shown in the image.
- There are angles with measurements (x-1)°, 79°, (x+10)°, and 2x°.
- Lines FB and CI seem to be parallel.
- Angles EDB and DBF are supplementary, and angles HCI and IGB are supplementary

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines FB and CI are parallel.
- Angle DBF and angle BCI are alternate interior angles and thus congruent.
- Angle BDI and angle DIC are alternate interior angles and thus congruent.
- Since line FB is parallel to line CI, angles DBF and BCI are congruent, as are angles BDI and DIC.
- Angle EDB and 79 are supplementary, which means they sum to 180
- Angle HCI and angle 2x are supplementary, which means they sum to 180.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle DBF = (x-1)°
- Measure of angle EDB = 79°
- Measure of angle HCI = (x+10)°
- Measure of angle IGB = 2x°
- Angle DBF and angle BCI are congruent
- Angle EDB and 79 are supplementary, so measure angle BDI = 180-79=101 degrees.
- Angle HCI and 2x are supplementary

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- The supplementary angles EDB and BDI, and HCI and IGB are important.
- The parallel lines give angle equalities that relate x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the points, lines, angles, parallel lines, and angle relationships.
- The equation will be 180 - 79 = x-1 which results in x = 102
- The other equation is x + 10 + 2x = 180 which results in 3x = 170 and x = 170/3
