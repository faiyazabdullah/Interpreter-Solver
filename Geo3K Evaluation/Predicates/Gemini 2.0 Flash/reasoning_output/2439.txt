PROBLEM 2439 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle R S T.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle RST with vertices labeled R, S, T.
- There is an angle measure of 70 degrees at vertex R.
- Side RS is marked as congruent to side RT.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RST is an isosceles triangle because RS = RT.
- Since RST is isosceles, the angles opposite the congruent sides are also congruent: Angle RST = Angle RTS.
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle R = 70 degrees (given).

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle RST.
- Need to determine angle RST.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, given angle, congruent sides, and relationships of isosceles triangle.
- The sum of angles must equal 180.
