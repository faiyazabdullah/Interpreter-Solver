PROBLEM 2718 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle DEF with vertices labeled D, E, F.
- There is a point G on line EF such that line DG is perpendicular to line EF, making triangle DGF a right triangle.
- Angle DEF is 25 degrees.
- Angle DFE is 65 degrees.
- Angle DGE is a right angle.
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are formed at point D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle DGF is a right triangle.
- Line DG is perpendicular to line EF.
- Angle EDG and Angle 1 form angle EDF.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle DEF = 25 degrees.
- Angle DFE = 65 degrees.
- Angle DGE = 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of Angle 1.
- In triangle DGF, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. Angle DGF is 90 degrees and Angle DFE is 65 degrees, which means Angle FDG (Angle 2) is 180 - 90 - 65 = 25 degrees.
- In triangle DEG, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. Angle DEG is 25 degrees and Angle DGE is 90 degrees, which means Angle EDG (Angle 1) is 180 - 90 - 25 = 65 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle DEF, point G, perpendicularity, and angles.
- Use the angle measurements provided.
