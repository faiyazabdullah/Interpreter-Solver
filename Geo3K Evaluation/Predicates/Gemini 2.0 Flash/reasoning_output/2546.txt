PROBLEM 2546 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded sector. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center X
- There is a sector XYW within the circle
- The radius of the circle is 2 cm
- The angle XYW is 52 degrees
- The sector is shaded green

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The lines XY and XW are radii of the circle.
- The sector XYW is a portion of the circle
- The area of the sector is proportional to the angle XYW divided by 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of the circle is 2 cm
- Angle XYW is 52 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the shaded sector
- Need to use the radius and the angle to calculate the area
- Area of sector = (angle/360) * pi * r^2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need predicates for:
    - Circle
    - Sector
    - Points X, Y, W
    - Radius
    - Angle measure
    - Shaded region
