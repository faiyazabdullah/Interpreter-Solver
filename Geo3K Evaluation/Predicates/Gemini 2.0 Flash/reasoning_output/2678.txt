PROBLEM 2678 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m \angle 2 = 2 x, m \angle 3 = x. Find m \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- Points F, B, A, H, G, and J lie on the circle.
- Line segment FH is a diameter.
- Line segment GJ is a diameter.
- Angle 1 is a right angle.
- Angle 2 is labeled, and its measure is given as 2x.
- Angle 3 is labeled, and its measure is given as x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle GHJ is inscribed in the circle.
- Angle GHJ is a right angle, subtending the diameter GJ.
- FH and GJ are diameters.
- Since angle 1 is a right angle, line segments GH and JH are perpendicular.
- Angles 2 and 3 are acute angles in right triangle GHJ.
- Therefore, angles 2 and 3 are complementary and add up to 90 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠2 = 2x
- m∠3 = x
- m∠1 = 90 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the measure of angle 2.
- We know that the sum of angles 2 and 3 is 90 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, angles, and the fact that they lie on the circle.
- Represent the perpendicularity condition.
- Represent the equations given for the measures of the angles.
- Represent the relationship between angle 2 and angle 3.
