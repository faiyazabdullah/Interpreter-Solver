PROBLEM 2559 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Angle C is marked as 60 degrees.
- Side AB is marked as 8√3.
- Side AC is marked as x.
- Side BC is marked as y.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A.
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular.
- Side BC is the hypotenuse.
- Angle BAC is 90 degrees.
- Angle ACB is 60 degrees.
- Angle ABC is 30 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 8√3 units (given)
- AC = x units (given)
- BC = y units (given)
- Angle ACB = 60 degrees (given)
- Angle BAC = 90 degrees (implied)
- Angle ABC = 30 degrees (implied)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x (side AC).
- We know side AB and angle C.
- We can use tan(C) = AB/AC.
- So, AC = AB/tan(C) = (8√3)/tan(60°) = (8√3)/√3 = 8

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include trigonometric relationship for solving.
