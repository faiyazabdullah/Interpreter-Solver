PROBLEM 2409 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Angle BAC is a right angle.
- Angle ABC is labeled as 30 degrees.
- Angle BCA is labeled as 60 degrees.
- Side AC is labeled as 21.
- Side AB is labeled as y.
- Side BC is labeled as x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle, with the right angle at A.
- The angles of the triangle sum to 180 degrees.
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular.
- The sides are related through trigonometric functions.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle ABC = 30 degrees.
- Measure of angle BCA = 60 degrees.
- Measure of angle BAC = 90 degrees.
- Length of side AC = 21.
- Length of side AB = y (unknown).
- Length of side BC = x (unknown).

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of y.
- Since we know one side (AC) and the angles, we can use trigonometric ratios (tangent) to solve for y.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, angles, side lengths, and right angle.
- Establish the relationships between sides and angles.
- Use the tangent function.
