PROBLEM 2833 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \triangle C D F, K is the centroid and D K = 16. Find C D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle CDF with a point K inside.
- There are lines connecting the vertices to point K, extending to points G, H, and J on the opposite sides.
- The length of FK is labeled as 12.
- The length of DG is labeled as 9.
- K is labeled as the centroid.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- K is the centroid of triangle CDF, which means that CK, DK, and FK are medians.
- Medians intersect at the centroid.
- Since K is the centroid, DK is 2/3 of the median DJ, FK is 2/3 of the median FH, and CK is 2/3 of the median CG.
- The segments CG, DJ, and FH are medians of triangle CDF.
- G is the midpoint of CF, H is the midpoint of CD, and J is the midpoint of DF.
- The problem states DK = 16.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FK = 12
- DG = 9
- DK = 16

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the length of CD.
- Since DK is 2/3 of DJ, we can find the length of DJ.
- However, this problem might have something to do with medians and centroid property.
- Since K is the centroid, then DK = (2/3) DJ.
- The median intersects at G, H, and J.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangle CDF and point K.
- Define that K is the centroid.
- Define the medians CG, DJ, and FH.
- State the given lengths DK = 16.
- State that G, H, and J are midpoints of sides CF, CD, and DF, respectively.
- State DK is (2/3) of DJ.
- CD is the length that needs to be found.
