PROBLEM 2407 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a pentagon with vertices B, C, H, G, and D.
- The exterior angles are labeled at each vertex with algebraic expressions.
- The exterior angles are (x+4) degrees at B, x degrees at C, (x-6) degrees at H, (x+10) degrees at G, and 56 degrees at D.
- There are lines extending from each vertex, creating exterior angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees.
- The angles at vertices B, C, H, G, and D are exterior angles.
- These angles form a complete set of exterior angles for the pentagon.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measures of the exterior angles are given as algebraic expressions and a numerical value: (x+4), x, (x-6), (x+10), and 56.
- These measurements are in degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- To find x, we need to set up an equation based on the fact that the sum of the exterior angles is 360 degrees.
- This means adding all the expressions and setting the sum equal to 360.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the pentagon.
- Define the points.
- Define the angles and their measurements.
- Express the sum of the exterior angles equals 360.
