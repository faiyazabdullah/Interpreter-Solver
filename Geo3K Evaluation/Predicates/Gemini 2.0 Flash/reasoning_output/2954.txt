PROBLEM 2954 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center C.
- Points A, B, and D lie on the circle.
- Line segment AB passes through the center C and is a diameter.
- Triangle ABD is inscribed in the circle.
- Angle ADB is a right angle.
- Angle 2 is indicated in the diagram.
- Line segment AD has a measurement of 2.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AB is a diameter of the circle.
- Angle ADB is an inscribed angle that intercepts the diameter AB. Therefore, angle ADB is a right angle.
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AD is 2.
- Angle ADB is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 2.
- Since triangle ABD is a right triangle and angle ADB is 90 degrees, then angles 2 and angle BAD are complementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, lines, triangle, and measurements.
- Need to represent the right angle.
- Need to represent the relationships between the shapes.
