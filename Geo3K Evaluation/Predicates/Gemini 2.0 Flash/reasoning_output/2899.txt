PROBLEM 2899 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If C W = W F and E D = 30, what is D F?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center W.
- There are two chords, AB and ED.
- Line WC is perpendicular to AB at point C.
- Line WF is perpendicular to ED at point F.
- Points A, B, D, and E lie on the circle.
- Points C and F lie on the chords AB and ED respectively.
- Length of ED is given as 30.
- CW = WF

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- WC is perpendicular to AB, so C is the midpoint of AB.
- WF is perpendicular to ED, so F is the midpoint of ED.
- Since CW = WF, and WC is perpendicular to AB and WF is perpendicular to ED.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ED = 30
- CW = WF

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of DF.
- Since F is the midpoint of ED, DF = ED/2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the circle, points, lines, perpendicularity, and midpoints.
- Need to specify the equality of CW and WF and the length of ED.
