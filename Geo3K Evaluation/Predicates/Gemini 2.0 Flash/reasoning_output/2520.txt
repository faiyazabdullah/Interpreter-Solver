================================================================================
Question: A B \perp D C and G H \perp F E. If \triangle A C D \sim \triangle G E F, find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains two triangles, $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle GEF$.
- In $\triangle ACD$, there is a line $AB$ that is perpendicular to $DC$.
- In $\triangle GEF$, there is a line $GH$ that is perpendicular to $FE$.
- The length of $AC$ is given as 4.4.
- The length of $GE$ is given as 6.3.
- The length of $GH$ is given as 3.15.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- $AB \perp DC$ implies $\angle ABC = 90^{\circ}$ and $\angle ABD = 90^{\circ}$.
- $GH \perp FE$ implies $\angle GHE = 90^{\circ}$ and $\angle GHF = 90^{\circ}$.
- The triangles $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle GEF$ are similar, denoted as $\triangle ACD \sim \triangle GEF$.
- Since $\triangle ACD \sim \triangle GEF$, corresponding sides are in proportion.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of $AC = 4.4$
- Length of $GE = 6.3$
- Length of $GH = 3.15$

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of $AB$.
- We know the triangles $\triangle ACD$ and $\triangle GEF$ are similar, thus the ratio of corresponding altitudes and sides are equal.
- $\frac{AB}{GH} = \frac{AC}{GE}$

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all shapes: triangles, lines, points.
- State the given lengths: AC, GE, GH.
- State the perpendicular relationships: $AB \perp DC$, $GH \perp FE$.
- State the similarity: $\triangle ACD \sim \triangle GEF$.
- State the ratios of corresponding sides: $\frac{AB}{GH} = \frac{AC}{GE}$.
