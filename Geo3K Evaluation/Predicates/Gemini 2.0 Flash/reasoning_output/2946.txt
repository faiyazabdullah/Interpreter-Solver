PROBLEM 2946 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If F G H J is a kite, find m \angle G F J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral FGHJ, which is a kite.
- Point F, G, H, and J are vertices of the kite.
- The angle at G is labeled as 128 degrees.
- The angle at J is labeled as 72 degrees.
- FG is congruent to GH.
- FJ is congruent to HJ.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral FGHJ is a kite.
- By the properties of a kite, FG = GH and FJ = HJ.
- Also, angles F and H are equal.
- The sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠G = 128 degrees
- m∠J = 72 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle G F J (m∠GFJ).
- We can use the properties of a kite and the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral to find the missing angle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the kite and its vertices.
- State the given angle measurements.
- State the congruent sides.
- State that the angles at F and H are congruent.
- State that the sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
