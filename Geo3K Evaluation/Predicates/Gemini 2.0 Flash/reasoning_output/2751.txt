PROBLEM 2751 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If \frac { I J } { X J } = \frac { H J } { Y J }, m \angle W X J = 130 and m \angle W Z G = 20, find m \angle Y I Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a figure with points D, W, X, Y, Z, C, G, H, I, J.
- I can see lines DWXC and GHIY.
- I can see angles WXJ and YIZ
- I can see a triangle HIJ
- I can see that line DWXC and line GHIY intersect
- Measurement m \angle W X J = 130^{\circ} is shown.
- Measurement m \angle Y Z G = 20^{\circ} is shown.
- The ratio I J / X J = H J / Y J is given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point X lies on line DWXC. Point Y also lies on line DWXC. Point Z also lies on line DWXC.
- Point H lies on line GHIY. Point I also lies on line GHIY.
- Lines XJ and IJ form triangle XJI.
- Lines HJ and YJ form line segment HJ and YJ.
- Angle WXJ and angle JXI are supplementary.
- Angle YZI and angle GZY are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measurement of angle WXJ is 130 degrees. Therefore, the measurement of angle JXI = 180 - 130 = 50 degrees.
- Measurement of angle YZG is 20 degrees. Therefore the measurement of angle YZI is 180 - 20 = 160 degrees.
- Ratio IJ / XJ = HJ / YJ is given. This can be rewritten as IJ / HJ = XJ / YJ.
- Angle J is common to triangles JIJ and JXY.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find m \angle Y I Z.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- The predicates should represent the points, lines, angles and given angle measurements, and the ratios.
