PROBLEM 2812 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is inscribed in \odot V. Find m \angle X.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a circle with center V.
- I can identify points W, X, Y, and Z on the circle.
- I can identify a quadrilateral WXYZ inscribed in the circle V.
- I can see that angle ZVY is 60 degrees.
- I can see that angle ZWX is 95 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXYZ is inscribed in circle V.
- This means that the quadrilateral is cyclic, so its opposite angles are supplementary.
- Therefore, angle W + angle Y = 180 degrees and angle X + angle Z = 180 degrees.
- I am given angle ZWX = 95 degrees.
- I need to determine angle X.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ZVY = 60 degrees.
- Angle ZWX = 95 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find m \angle X.
- Since WXYZ is a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary, so angle Z + angle X = 180. We know angle W = 95.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, quadrilateral, points, and angles.
- Represent the measurements of the given angles.
- Represent that WXYZ is inscribed in circle V.
- Express the supplementary property of opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral.
