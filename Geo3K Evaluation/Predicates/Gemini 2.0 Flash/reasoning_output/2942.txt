PROBLEM 2942 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Side AB is marked as 9 units.
- Side AC is marked as 9 units.
- Angle A is marked as 60 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle because AB = AC.
- Since AB = AC and angle A is 60 degrees, then angle B and angle C are equal and their measures can be determined. Also triangle ABC is an Equilateral triangle.
- This means that all sides of triangle ABC are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 9 units (given)
- AC = 9 units (given)
- Angle A = 60 degrees (given)
- BC length is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BC.
- Since ABC is an isosceles triangle and angle A is 60 degrees, the other two angles will be equal, therefore it is an equilateral triangle.
- BC = AB = AC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, measurements, and relationships.
- Since AB = AC and angle A is 60 degrees, BC must equal 9.
