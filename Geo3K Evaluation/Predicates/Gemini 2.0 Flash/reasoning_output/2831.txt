PROBLEM 2831 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with points B, A, C, E, and F on its circumference.
- I see a line segment BD intersecting the circle at point A.
- I see a line segment CE intersecting the circle at point F.
- I see a line segment AD with length 8.
- I see a line segment AB with length 15.
- I see a line segment CF with length 12.
- The variable x is the length of segment AX.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line BD is a secant to the circle.
- Line CE is a secant to the circle.
- By the power of a point theorem, the product of the segments of a secant from an external point to a circle is constant. Thus, DA * DB = DF * DC
- DB = DA + AB = 8 + 15 = 23
- DC = CF + FE

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DA = 8
- AB = 15
- CF = 12
- Let AX = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, where x is the length of AX.
- I need to find the relationship between the segments using the power of a point theorem

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points and lines
- Specify the lengths of the given line segments
- State that points A, B, C, F lie on the circle
- Express the Power of a Point theorem.
