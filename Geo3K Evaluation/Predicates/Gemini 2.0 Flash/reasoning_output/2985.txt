PROBLEM 2985 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find A C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two right triangles, ABC and CDE.
- Points are labeled as A, B, C, D, and E.
- Lines are AB, BC, AC, CD, DE, and CE.
- Angles ABC and CDE are right angles.
- Length of BC is 4.
- Length of CD is 6.
- Length of AC is x + 7.
- Length of CE is 12 - x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC and triangle CDE are right triangles.
- Angle ABC and angle CDE are right angles.
- The triangles are similar.
- Lines AB and DE are parallel since they are both perpendicular to the same line BC/CD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 4
- CD = 6
- AC = x + 7
- CE = 12 - x
- These are the known lengths in the figure.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of AC (which is x+7).
- Since the triangles are similar, we can set up a proportion to find the value of x.
- We will use the ratio of corresponding sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangles.
- Define the points and lines.
- Define the right angles.
- Define the given lengths.
- State the triangles are similar.
- Establish the proportional relationship between the corresponding sides of the triangles.
