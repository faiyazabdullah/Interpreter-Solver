PROBLEM 2423 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find A B if \triangle A B C is an isosceles triangle with A B \cong B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle labeled ABC with vertices A, B, and C.
- The side lengths are labeled as follows: AB = 2x - 7, BC = 4x - 21, AC = x - 3
- The problem states that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB congruent to BC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AB is congruent to BC, we have the equation 2x - 7 = 4x - 21.
- We can solve for x and then substitute back into the expressions for the side lengths.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2x - 7
- BC = 4x - 21
- AC = x - 3
- The problem is asking to find the length of AB

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of AB.
- Since AB = BC, we can equate the two expressions and solve for x.
- Then, substitute the value of x back into the expression for AB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the congruence of sides AB and BC, and the expressions for the side lengths.
