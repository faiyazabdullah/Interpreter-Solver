PROBLEM 2769 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Inside the quadrilateral, triangle ABC has angles: Angle BAC = 100 degrees, Angle ABC = 40 degrees
- Angle DBC = 25x degrees
- Angle ACB = Angle BCA = unknown
- Angle BCD = 10y degrees
- Angle ADC = Angle CDA = unknown
- Angle BAD = Angle DAB = unknown

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure could be a parallelogram if certain conditions are met.
- If ABCD is a parallelogram, then AB is parallel to CD, and BC is parallel to AD
- If AB is parallel to CD, then Angle BAC + Angle ACD = 180, Angle ABC + Angle BCD = 180
- If BC is parallel to AD, then Angle ACB + Angle CAD = 180, Angle BCD + Angle CDA = 180
- Also, if ABCD is a parallelogram, then opposite angles are equal: Angle ABC = Angle ADC and Angle BAD = Angle BCD

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of Angle BAC = 100 degrees
- Measure of Angle ABC within triangle ABC = 40 degrees
- Measure of Angle DBC = 25x degrees
- Measure of Angle BCD = 10y degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x so that the quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram
- This requires that AB is parallel to CD and Angle ABC + Angle BCD = 180 degrees.
- We know Angle ABC = 40 + 25x, so Angle BCD should be 180 - (40 + 25x), also Angle BCD = 10y
- Also, Angle ABC+Angle BCD = 180, so 40+25x+10y = 180
- Moreover, in triangle ABC, Angle ACB = 180 - (100 + 40) = 40 degrees.
- If AB is parallel to CD, then Angle ABC + Angle BCD = 180. Therefore, 40+25x+10y = 180

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, points, lines, angles, and their measurements
- Need to represent that Angle ABC is equal to Angle ABD + Angle DBC.
- Need to represent Angle BCD is equal to Angle BCA + Angle ACD
