PROBLEM 2500 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a figure composed of a right triangle AFB and a rectangle BCDE.
- The vertices are labeled as A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- Angle ABF is 48 degrees.
- Angle FDE is 39 degrees.
- Segments BC and DE are marked with arrowheads, indicating they are parallel. Segments FB and CD are also marked with arrowheads, indicating they are parallel.
- Angle AFB is a right angle.
- Angle BCD is a right angle.
- Angle CDE is a right angle.
- Angle DEF is a right angle.
- The length of FD is labeled as 2.
- The length of ED is labeled as 3.
- Angle BAF is labeled as angle 1.
- Angle DFB is labeled as angle 2.
- Angle BDF is labeled as angle 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle AFB is a right triangle because angle AFB is a right angle.
- Quadrilateral BCDE is a rectangle because all its angles are right angles.
- Since BCDE is a rectangle, sides BC and DE are parallel and congruent. Also, sides CD and BE are parallel and congruent.
- Since BCDE is a rectangle, sides BC and DE have the same length, and CD and BE have the same length.
- Segment FB is parallel to segment CD, and segment BC is parallel to segment ED. Therefore, quadrilateral BCDE is a parallelogram.
- Angle BAF and angle ABF are complementary in triangle AFB, so their sum is 90 degrees.
- Angle FDB and angle DFB add to 90 + 39 = 129 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle ABF = 48 degrees
- Measure of angle FDE = 39 degrees
- Measure of angle AFB = 90 degrees
- Measure of angle BCD = 90 degrees
- Measure of angle CDE = 90 degrees
- Measure of angle DEF = 90 degrees
- Length of FD = 2
- Length of ED = 3

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 2, which is angle DFB.
- Triangle DEF is a right triangle.
- Since BCDE is a rectangle, we have length ED = length BC = 3 and length CD = length BE. Also length FB = length CD.
- We know angle EDF = 39, so we know that angle DFE = 90, and so angle DFB = 180-90-39 = 51.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles, triangles, quadrilaterals.
- State all given measurements.
- State all right angles, parallel lines, perpendicular lines.
- Triangle DEF is a right triangle.
