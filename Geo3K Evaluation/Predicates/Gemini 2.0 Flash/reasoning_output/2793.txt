PROBLEM 2793 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Angle DAB is labeled (6x+14)째.
- Angle ABC is labeled (6y+16)째.
- Angle BCD is labeled (7y+2)째.
- Angle CDA is labeled (8x-8)째.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The problem asks us to find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- In a parallelogram, opposite angles are congruent, and consecutive angles are supplementary.
- This means Angle DAB = Angle BCD and Angle ABC = Angle CDA, and Angle DAB + Angle CDA = 180 and Angle ABC + Angle BCD = 180.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle DAB = 6x+14
- Measure of angle ABC = 6y+16
- Measure of angle BCD = 7y+2
- Measure of angle CDA = 8x-8

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of y that makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram.
- Need to use the properties of parallelograms, specifically opposite angles being equal or consecutive angles being supplementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the quadrilateral.
- Represent the measures of the angles.
- Represent the parallelogram relationship.
- Represent opposite angles being equal.
- Represent consecutive angles being supplementary.
