PROBLEM 2911 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If c = 5, find b.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Angle BAC is marked as 30 degrees
- Angle ABC is marked as 60 degrees
- Side AB is labeled as c and is given as 5 units
- Side AC is labeled as b, which we need to find
- Side BC is labeled as a
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- Angles BAC and ABC are complementary.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse
- Side BC is opposite to angle BAC
- Side AC is adjacent to angle BAC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle BAC = 30 degrees
- Angle ABC = 60 degrees
- Angle ACB = 90 degrees
- Length of AB (c) = 5 units

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AC, which is labeled b
- Since we know the hypotenuse AB (c), and the angle BAC, we can use cosine to find the adjacent side AC (b).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the triangle, the angles, and the given length
- We also need to express the cosine relationship between angle BAC, side AC, and side AB.
