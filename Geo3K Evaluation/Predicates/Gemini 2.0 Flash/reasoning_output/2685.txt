PROBLEM 2685 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral QRSP.
- Point T is the intersection of diagonals QS and RP.
- Length of QT is 5y.
- Length of TS is 2y + 12.
- Length of RT is x.
- Length of TP is 5x - 28.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- For quadrilateral QRSP to be a parallelogram, the diagonals must bisect each other.
- That means QT = TS and RT = TP.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- QT = 5y
- TS = 2y + 12
- RT = x
- TP = 5x - 28

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of y so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- To solve for y, we need to set the lengths of QT and TS equal to each other: 5y = 2y + 12

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the quadrilateral, the intersection point of the diagonals, and the lengths of the segments.
- We need to express the condition that QT = TS for QRSP to be a parallelogram.
