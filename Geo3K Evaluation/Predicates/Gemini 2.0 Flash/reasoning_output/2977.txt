PROBLEM 2977 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find G D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle GHJ.
- I can see a point D on line GJ.
- I can see that angle G and angle HDG are congruent.
- I can see that angle H and angle DHJ are congruent.
- Side GH is labeled as 7.
- Side HJ is labeled as 10.
- Side GD is labeled as 2x - 2.
- Side HD is labeled as 2x + 4.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle GHD and Triangle HDJ are similar by Angle-Angle similarity, since angle G is congruent to angle HDJ, and angle H is congruent to angle DHJ.
- Since the triangles are similar, their sides are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GH = 7
- HJ = 10
- GD = 2x - 2
- HD = 2x + 4

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- I need to find the length of GD.
- Since triangles GHD and HDJ are similar, I can set up a proportion to solve for x.
- GD / GH = HD / HJ
- (2x - 2) / 7 = (2x + 4) / 10

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and triangles
- State congruency of the angles
- State similarity of the triangles
- Give the lengths of the sides in terms of x and constants.
- State the proportional relationship between the sides.
