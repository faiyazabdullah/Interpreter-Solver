PROBLEM 2569 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find \angle 5.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center J.
- Lines FIB and GCA intersect at point J inside the circle.
- Points A, B, C, E lie on the circle.
- Arc AC corresponds to a central angle, which measures 5.
- Arc EF measures 110 degrees.
- Arc BG measures 150 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle 5 is a vertical angle to angle EJC.
- Angle EJC is formed by the intersection of two chords inside the circle.
- The measure of angle EJC is half the sum of the intercepted arcs EC and FB.
- Arc EC = 360 - (Arc EF + Arc BG + Arc FB)

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of arc EF = 110 degrees
- Measure of arc BG = 150 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of angle 5.
- Since angle 5 is vertical to angle EJC, they have the same measure.
- To find the measure of angle EJC, we need the measures of arcs EC and FB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and points.
- Represent the intersection of lines.
- Represent the arcs and their measures.
- Represent the vertical angles.
- Represent the relationship between the angle formed by intersecting chords and intercepted arcs.
