PROBLEM 2840 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Side DA is marked as 41 ft.
- Side DC is marked as 48 ft.
- Side CB is marked as 53 ft.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C, making angle DCB a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid with sides DC and AB as bases.
- Side DC is perpendicular to side CB.
- The height of the trapezoid is the length of side DC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of side DA = 41 ft (given)
- Length of side DC = 48 ft (given)
- Length of side CB = 53 ft (given)
- Angle DCB is a right angle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the quadrilateral ABCD.
- The quadrilateral is a trapezoid.
- The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height
- In this case, base1 = DA = 41 ft, base2 = CB = 53 ft, and height = DC = 48 ft.
- Thus, the area is (1/2) * (41 + 53) * 48

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the quadrilateral, points, lines, and right angles.
- Represent the given measurements.
- State that the quadrilateral is a trapezoid.
- Provide the necessary information for calculating the area.
