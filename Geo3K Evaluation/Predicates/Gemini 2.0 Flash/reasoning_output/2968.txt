PROBLEM 2968 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If c = 5, find a.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- The side opposite to vertex A is labeled as 'a'.
- The side opposite to vertex B is labeled as 'b'.
- The side opposite to vertex C is labeled as 'c'.
- Angle A is 30 degrees.
- Angle B is 60 degrees.
- Angle C is a right angle (90 degrees).
- The hypotenuse 'c' has a length of 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- Angle C is the right angle.
- Side c is the hypotenuse.
- Sides a and b are legs of the right triangle.
- Angle A is 30 degrees and Angle B is 60 degrees, making this a 30-60-90 triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- c = 5 (length of hypotenuse)
- Angle A = 30 degrees
- Angle B = 60 degrees
- Angle C = 90 degrees
- We need to find 'a'.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of side 'a'.
- In a 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse.
- Therefore, a = c * sin(30)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, right angle, the lengths, the angles, and the relationship between them.
- We can use trigonometric ratios to relate the sides and angles.
