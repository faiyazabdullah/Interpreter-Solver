PROBLEM 2431 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In regular hexagon U V W X Y Z, the side is 12 centimeters long. Find W Y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a regular hexagon U V W X Y Z.
- The side length of the hexagon is marked as 12 centimeters.
- There are points A and B inside the hexagon.
- There are lines connecting various points of the hexagon.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the hexagon is regular, all its sides are equal in length.
- Since the hexagon is regular, all its interior angles are equal. Each interior angle is 120 degrees.
- The lines connecting the vertices create equilateral triangles in the center.
- W Y is a line segment connecting vertices W and Y.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of UV = Length of VW = Length of WX = Length of XY = Length of YZ = Length of ZU = 12
- We are asked to find the length of WY.
- Since the hexagon is regular, we can use properties of regular polygons.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of WY in regular hexagon U V W X Y Z.
- We need to use properties of regular hexagon to determine the length.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the hexagon and its regularity.
- We need to specify the length of the side of the hexagon.
- We need to represent the length of WY.
