PROBLEM 2413 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In rhombus A B C D, m \angle D A B = 2, m \angle A D C and C B = 6. Find m \angle A C D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rhombus ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- There is point E at the intersection of diagonals AC and BD.
- Side CB has a length of 6.
- The angle DAB is labeled with the letter 'm' meaning measure, and it equals to 2 times the measure of the angle ADC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rhombus, therefore all sides are equal in length, and opposite angles are equal.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel, and diagonals bisect each other.
- Diagonals of a rhombus intersect at right angles.
- Adjacent angles of a rhombus are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of CB = 6. Therefore, AB = BC = CD = DA = 6.
- m \angle DAB = 2 * m \angle ADC

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle ACD.
- Since we know it is a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles.
- We need to find the measures of the angles of the rhombus to find the measure of angle ACD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define rhombus ABCD
- Define the sides and their equal lengths
- Define the diagonals and their intersection point
- Define the angle relationship between adjacent angles DAB and ADC.
- Define that the diagonals bisect the angles of the rhombus and are perpendicular to each other.
