PROBLEM 2829 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded region. Assume that the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center F.
- A polygon ABCDEFGHIJ is circumscribed around the circle.
- The circle touches the sides of the polygon at points A, E, H, C, G, J, B, K, D, I.
- The radius of the circle FE is given as 21.
- The polygon ABCDEFGHIJ appears to be a regular decagon.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The polygon ABCDEFGHIJ is circumscribed about the circle.
- Each side of the decagon is tangent to the circle.
- The center of the circle F is equidistant from each side.
- The radius of the circle is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency.
- The polygon is a regular decagon.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the inscribed circle is 21.
- The polygon has 10 sides.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- The shaded area is the area between the decagon and the circle.
- The area of the decagon needs to be found and the area of the circle needs to be found.
- Then the area of the circle is subtracted from the area of the decagon.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and the decagon.
- Define the radius of the circle.
- Define the tangent lines.
- Define the relationships between the circle and decagon.
- Relate the area of the decagon to its sides and apothem.
- Relate the area of the circle to its radius.
