PROBLEM 2733 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a square ABCD.
- Point A, B, C, and D are the vertices of the square.
- AC is a diagonal of the square.
- The length of side AC is 12.
- The length of the diagonal AC is represented by variable 'y'.
- Angle CAB is denoted by x degrees.
- Angle ABC is a right angle.
- Sides AD and DB are congruent.
- Sides AB and BC are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a square, implying all sides are equal and all angles are right angles.
- AC is the diagonal of the square, which divides the square into two right triangles.
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle since angle ABC is a right angle.
- Since ABCD is a square, AD = DB.
- Since ABCD is a square, AB = BC = CD = DA.
- AC is a diagonal, so it connects non-adjacent vertices.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 12
- We need to find y, the length of the diagonal AC.
- Therefore, y = LengthOf(Line(A,C))
- Since the figure is a square, angle DAB, ABC, BCD, CDA are all right angles.
- Since the figure is a square, the two sides adjacent to the right angle equal each other.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of the diagonal AC, which is labeled as y.
- Since triangle ABC is a right triangle, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the square ABCD.
- Define the points A, B, C, D.
- Define the lines AB, BC, CD, DA, and AC.
- Define the angles ABC, BCD, CDA, DAB.
- Specify the right angles.
- Specify that sides AD and AB are congruent.
- Specify that AC = 12.
- Represent the Pythagorean theorem for triangle ABC.
- State that AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ABC.
