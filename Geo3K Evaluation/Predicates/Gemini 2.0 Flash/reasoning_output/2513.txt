PROBLEM 2513 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side BC is marked as 16 units
- Side AB is marked as x units
- Angle A is marked as 97 degrees
- Angle C is marked as 21 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a triangle
- The sum of the angles in the triangle is 180 degrees.
- Side AB is opposite angle C, Side BC is opposite angle A.
- Need to use the law of sines to solve for the missing side x.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 16 units
- AB = x units
- Angle A = 97 degrees
- Angle C = 21 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of side AB which is labeled x.
- This requires using the law of sines.
- First find angle B.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Represent the law of sines relationship for solving
