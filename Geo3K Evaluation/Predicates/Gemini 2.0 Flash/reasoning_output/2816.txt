PROBLEM 2816 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In R S T V, R S = 6, V T = 3 and R X is twice the length of X V. Find X Y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral RSTV.
- R, S, T, V are vertices of the quadrilateral.
- Points X and Y lie on lines RV and ST respectively.
- Line RS has length 6.
- Line VT has length 3.
- Lines RX and SY appear to have equal length.
- Lines XV and YT appear to have equal length.
- RS and VT are parallel.
- XY and VT are parallel.
- RX is twice the length of XV.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- RSTV is a trapezoid since RS and VT are parallel.
- XYTV is a parallelogram because XY is parallel to VT and XV is parallel to YT
- RX = SY
- XV = YT
- Since XYTV is a parallelogram, XY = VT

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RS = 6
- VT = 3
- RX = 2 * XV

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of XY.
- Since XYTV is a parallelogram, XY = VT.
- Therefore XY = 3.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the quadrilateral RSTV.
- Define the points R, S, T, V, X, Y.
- Define the lines RS, VT, RV, ST, XY, XV, YT, RX, SY.
- Specify the lengths of RS and VT.
- Specify that RX = SY and XV = YT.
- Specify RX = 2 * XV
