PROBLEM 2785 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center not explicitly shown.
- Points G, K, J, H lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Line segment KH intersects line segment GJ at point L.
- Angle HLJ is given as 110 degrees.
- Arc KJ has a measure of 97 degrees.
- Arc GH has a measure of x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle HLJ is formed by intersecting chords KH and GJ.
- The measure of an angle formed by intersecting chords inside a circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs.
- Angle HLJ intercepts arc KJ and arc GH.
- Therefore, the measure of angle HLJ is half the sum of the measures of arc KJ and arc GH.
- m(angle HLJ) = (m(arc KJ) + m(arc GH))/2
- 110 = (97 + x)/2

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m(angle HLJ) = 110 degrees
- m(arc KJ) = 97 degrees
- m(arc GH) = x degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of x.
- x represents the measure of arc GH.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to create predicates for the circle, points, chords, arcs, and the angle formed by intersecting chords.
- We also need to include the relationship between the angle and the intercepted arcs.
