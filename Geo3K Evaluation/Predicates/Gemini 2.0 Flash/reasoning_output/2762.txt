PROBLEM 2762 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle A B C \sim \triangle F D G. Find the value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles ABC and FDG.
- Triangle ABC contains point P on side BC and line AP.
- Triangle FDG contains point Q on side DG and line FQ.
- Side AB of triangle ABC is labeled 15.
- Segment AP within triangle ABC is labeled x.
- Side DF of triangle FDG is labeled 12.
- Segment FQ within triangle FDG is labeled 8.
- Angle CAP is congruent to angle PAF.
- Angle DFG is congruent to angle QFG.
- The problem states triangle ABC is similar to triangle FDG.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is similar to triangle FDG.
- Angle CAP is congruent to angle BAP, thus AP bisects angle CAB.
- Angle DFG is congruent to angle QFG, thus FQ bisects angle DFG.
- Corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15
- AP = x
- DF = 12
- FQ = 8

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- Since the triangles are similar, the angle bisectors should also be proportional.
- We can set up the proportion: AB/DF = AP/FQ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles, their similarity, measurements, and angle bisectors.
- Use the angle bisector theorem for similar triangles to create a proportion.
