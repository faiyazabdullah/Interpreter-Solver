PROBLEM 2835 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A square is inscribed in a circle of area 18 \pi square units. Find the length of a side of the square.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- A square BCDE is inscribed in the circle.
- The vertices B, C, D, and E lie on the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- BCDE is a square, so all sides are equal in length and all angles are right angles.
- The circle circumscribes the square.
- The area of the circle is given.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Area of the circle = 18Ï€

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of a side of the square.
- The area of the circle is related to the radius.
- The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circle.
- Knowing the diagonal, the side length of the square can be calculated.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, square, their relationship, and the given area.
- Include predicates for equal sides and right angles of the square.
- Relate the area of the circle to its radius.
- Relate the diagonal of the square to the diameter of the circle.
