PROBLEM 2614 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle E F G is equilateral, and E H bisects \angle E. Find m \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle EFG.
- I can see a line EH.
- Point H lies on line FG.
- Angle E is bisected by line EH creating angle 1 and angle 2.
- Angle FHE is a right angle.
- Angle FH has a measure of 15x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle EFG is equilateral, therefore all sides are congruent and all angles are congruent.
- EH bisects angle E, meaning angle 1 is congruent to angle 2.
- Since triangle EFG is equilateral, each angle measures 60 degrees.
- EH is an altitude of triangle EFG, as angle FHE is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle FH is labeled as 15x degrees, and is part of the right angle FHE.
- Since EFG is equilateral, each angle is 60 degrees.
- Angle E is bisected into two equal angles, angle 1 and angle 2.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 2.
- I need to find the value of x first.
- I know that angle FH is 15x degrees.
- I know that triangle EFG is equilateral.
- I know that EH bisects angle E.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define triangle EFG
- Define point H, line EH
- Define angles 1, 2, FHE, FH
- State that triangle EFG is equilateral
- State that EH bisects angle E
- State that angle FHE is a right angle
- Define the measure of angle FH as 15x
