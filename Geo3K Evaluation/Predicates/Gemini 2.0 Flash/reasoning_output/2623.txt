PROBLEM 2623 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For trapezoid A B C D, S and T are midpoints of the legs. If A B = x + 4, C D = 3 x + 2, and S T = 9, find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- ST is a line segment within the trapezoid connecting sides AC and BD.
- S is on AC, and T is on BD.
- AB = x + 4
- CD = 3x + 2
- ST = 9

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a trapezoid.
- AB and CD are parallel.
- S is the midpoint of AC.
- T is the midpoint of BD.
- ST is the midsegment of trapezoid ABCD.
- The midsegment ST is parallel to bases AB and CD.
- The length of the midsegment ST is the average of the lengths of the bases AB and CD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AB is x + 4
- Length of CD is 3x + 2
- Length of ST is 9

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the length of AB.
- The midsegment ST is the average of the lengths of the bases AB and CD.
- This is the key relationship for finding AB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the trapezoid.
- Represent the midpoints.
- Represent the lengths of the sides.
- State that ST is the midsegment.
- Represent that ST is equal to the average of AB and CD.
