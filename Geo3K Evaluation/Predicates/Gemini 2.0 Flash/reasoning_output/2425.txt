PROBLEM 2425 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round the side measure to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 73 units
- Angle B is marked as 60 degrees
- Angle A is marked as 55 degrees
- Side AC is labeled as x

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a triangle.
- Angles A, B, and C are angles of triangle ABC.
- Sides AB, BC, and AC are sides of triangle ABC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 73 units (given)
- Angle B = 60 degrees (given)
- Angle A = 55 degrees (given)
- AC = x (unknown)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AC, which is labeled as x.
- I can use the Law of Sines to find the length of AC.
- First, I need to find the measure of angle C by subtracting the measures of angles A and B from 180.
- After finding the measure of angle C, I can set up a proportion using the Law of Sines:  sin(B) / AC = sin(C) / AB, or sin(60) / x = sin(C) / 73.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include relationships for solving using Law of Sines.
