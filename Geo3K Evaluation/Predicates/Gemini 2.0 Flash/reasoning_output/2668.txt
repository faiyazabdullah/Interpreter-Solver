PROBLEM 2668 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC.
- There's a point D on line AC such that BD is perpendicular to AC, forming a right angle at D.
- Angle ACB measures 55 degrees.
- Angle CAB measures 47 degrees.
- The segment CD measures 12 units.
- The segment BD is labeled as x.
- The segment AB is labeled as y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a triangle, with altitude BD.
- Triangles BDC and BDA are right triangles.
- Angle BDC and Angle BDA are right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle ACB = 55 degrees
- Measure of angle CAB = 47 degrees
- Length of CD = 12
- Length of BD = x
- Length of AB = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of y, which is the length of AB.
- We have a right triangle BDA, where the angle DAB is 47 degrees and we need to find the hypotenuse AB. We first need to find length BD = x

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to create predicates to define all the shapes, angles and lengths in the diagram.
- We need predicates for the trig relationships
- We can use triangle BDC to find x.
- Then, we can use triangle BDA to find y.
