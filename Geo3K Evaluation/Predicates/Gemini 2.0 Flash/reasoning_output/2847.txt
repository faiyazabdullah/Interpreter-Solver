PROBLEM 2847 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \widehat J K L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center C.
- There are points H, J, K, and L on the circle.
- There is a line HB which is tangent to the circle at J.
- There is a line KE which is a secant line to the circle passing through points J and K.
- Angle KJI is labeled as 116 degrees.
- The question asks us to find the measure of arc JKL.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since line HB is tangent to the circle at J, angle CJB is a right angle (90 degrees).
- Angle KJI is an external angle to triangle CJK.
- Since CJ and CK are radii of the circle, triangle CJK is an isosceles triangle and angles CJK and CKJ are congruent.
- Angle CJK is supplementary to angle KJI.
- The measure of central angle JCK is equal to the measure of arc JK.
- The measure of arc JLK is 360 degrees - measure of arc JK

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle KJI = 116 degrees.
- Angle CJB = 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking to find the measure of arc JKL.
- We can find the measure of arc JK and then subtract it from 360 to get the measure of arc JKL.
- We can use the information about the angles to determine the measure of arc JK.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, angles.
- Represent the tangency relationship.
- Represent that CJ and CK are radii.
- Calculate angle CJK using supplementary angle relationship.
- Represent the isosceles triangle CJK and the congruent angles.
- Calculate the angle JCK.
- Represent arc JKL as equal to 360 - measure of arc JK.
