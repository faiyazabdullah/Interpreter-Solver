PROBLEM 2872 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of m \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- Points D, B, and C lie on the circle.
- Angle 1 is formed by segments DB and BC.
- The major arc DC is marked as 218 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle 1 is an inscribed angle.
- The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
- The intercepted arc for angle 1 is arc DC.
- The measure of the major arc DC is given as 218 degrees.
- The minor arc DC can be found by subtracting the major arc from 360 degrees.
- The intercepted arc for inscribed angle DBC is the minor arc DC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Major arc DC = 218 degrees.
- The entire circle is 360 degrees.
- Therefore, the minor arc DC = 360 - 218 = 142 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1 (angle DBC).
- Angle DBC is an inscribed angle that intercepts minor arc DC.
- The measure of angle DBC is half the measure of minor arc DC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the circle, points, and angle 1.
- Need to state that the points lie on the circle.
- Need to define major arc DC and its measure.
- Need to relate the minor arc to the major arc.
- Need to define angle 1 as an inscribed angle and relate it to the intercepted minor arc DC.
