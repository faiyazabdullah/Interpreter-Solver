PROBLEM 2584 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 4 = 101. Find the measure of \angle 6.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- I can see lines BC, CD, FA, AE, and GH.
- I can see angles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- I can see that angle 4 is labeled with m \angle 4 = 101.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines BC and FA appear to be parallel.
- Line GH intersects lines BC and FA.
- Angles 4 and 5 appear to be supplementary, and angles 6 and 8 appear to be vertical angles.
- Angle 4 and angle 6 are alternate interior angles.
- Angle 4 and angle 8 are corresponding angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 4 = 101 (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 6.
- If BC and FA are parallel, then angle 6 and angle 4 are alternate interior angles and should be equal.
- I need to find out if BC and FA are parallel.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the points, lines, and angles.
- Need to represent the given measurement of angle 4.
- Need to check for parallel lines based on alternate interior or corresponding angles being equal.
