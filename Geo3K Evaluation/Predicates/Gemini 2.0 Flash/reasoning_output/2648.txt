PROBLEM 2648 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center A.
- Points B, C, D, E, F lie on the circle.
- Lines AC, AD, AE, AF, AB are radii of the circle.
- Angle CAD is given as 67 degrees.
- Angle FAB is labeled as x degrees.
- Angle FAD is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AD and AF are perpendicular.
- Since AD and AB are radii, they are congruent.
- Similarly, AF and AB are congruent to all radii.
- Angles CAD and FAB are part of angle CAB, which forms a straight line with point A as the vertex.
- Angle CAB is a straight angle, thus 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle CAD = 67 degrees
- Measure of angle FAD = 90 degrees
- Measure of angle FAB = x degrees
- Angle CAB is a straight angle = 180 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of x, the measure of angle FAB.
- We know that angles CAD, FAD, and FAB add up to 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines, angles, and circle.
- Represent the right angle FAD.
- Represent the measures of angles CAD, FAB.
- Represent the fact that the sum of the angles CAD, FAD, FAB is 180 degrees.
