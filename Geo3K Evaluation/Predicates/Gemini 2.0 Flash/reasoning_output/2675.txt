PROBLEM 2675 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of m \angle 1. Assume that segments that appear tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center E.
- I can see points B, D, F, and C.
- I can see lines BD, DF, and FC.
- I can see angle BDF with measure 102 degrees.
- I can see angle 1, which is angle DFC.
- Line BD is tangent to the circle at D.
- Line FC is tangent to the circle at F.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- BD and FC are tangents to the circle.
- Therefore, angles EDF and EFD are related to angles BDE and EFC respectively.
- The measure of the angle formed by two tangents is supplementary to the central angle subtended by the points of tangency.
- Angle BDF is an exterior angle to triangle EDF.
- ED and EF are radii, so triangle EDF is isosceles.
- Angle EDF + Angle 1 is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle BDF = 102 degrees.
- Need to find the measure of angle 1.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find the measure of angle 1 (DFC).
- The tangents BD and CF intersect outside the circle, forming angle BDF.
- Triangle EDF is isosceles since ED = EF (radii).
- Angle EDF = 180 - 102 = 78
- Angle DEF = 180 - (angle EDF)
- angle EFD = angle 1 = (180 - angle DEF)/2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, circle, and angles.
- Specify that BD and CF are tangent to the circle.
- Specify the measurement of angle BDF.
- Represent the isosceles triangle EDF and its properties.
- Relate the angles within triangle EDF.
