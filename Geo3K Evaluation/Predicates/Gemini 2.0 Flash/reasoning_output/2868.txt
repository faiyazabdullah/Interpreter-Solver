PROBLEM 2868 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle DBC with vertices labeled D, B, C.
- There is a line AE inside the triangle.
- DC = 4
- CE = 5
- EB = 12
- AB = x
- AE is parallel to DC

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AE is parallel to DC, triangle ABE is similar to triangle DBC by AA similarity (Angle-Angle).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DC = 4, CE = 5, EB = 12, AB = x
- CB = CE + EB = 5 + 12 = 17
- DB = DA + AB = DA + x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- Since the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional.
- CB/EB = CD/AE = DB/AB
- CB/EB = CD/AE = (DA+AB)/AB

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- State that DC is parallel to AE
- State the measurements of DC, CE, EB, AB
- Define CB as CE + EB
- Establish that triangle ABE is similar to triangle DBC
- State the proportionality of corresponding sides
