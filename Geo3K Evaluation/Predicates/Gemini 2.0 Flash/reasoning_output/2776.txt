PROBLEM 2776 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral A B C D is a rectangle. m \angle 2 = 40. Find m \angle 8.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- I can see that it is a rectangle.
- I can see the diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point E.
- I can see angles labeled 1 through 8.
- I can see that angle 2 measures 40 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle, implying all angles are 90 degrees.
- Diagonals AC and BD bisect each other at point E.
- Diagonals AC and BD are congruent.
- Angles 5, 6, 7, and 8 are formed by the intersection of the diagonals.
- Angle 1 and angle 2 are complementary angles since angle A is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠2 = 40 degrees.
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, m∠ABC = m∠BCD = m∠CDA = m∠DAB = 90 degrees.
- The question asks us to find m∠8.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 8.
- We need to use the properties of a rectangle, its diagonals, and angle relationships to solve for angle 8.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, diagonals, intersection point, and given angle measure.
- Also need to represent angle relationships.
