PROBLEM 2988 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 11 units.
- Angle ACB is marked as 21 degrees.
- Side AC is labeled as x units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 11 units (given)
- Angle ACB = 21 degrees (given)
- AC = x units (to be found)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AC which is labeled as x.
- Since we have a right triangle and an angle we can use trigonometric ratios to solve.
- We can use the sine function as we know the opposite side AB and need to find the hypotenuse AC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include trigonometric relationship (sine) for solving.
