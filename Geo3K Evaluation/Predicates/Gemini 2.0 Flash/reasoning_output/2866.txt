PROBLEM 2866 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 3 = 110 and m \angle 12 = 55. Find the measure of \angle 13.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify three lines DB, JL and HE.
- I can identify two lines CF and EG.
- There are intersections between line DB and CF at one point, HE at another point.
- There are intersections between line JL and CF at one point, EG at another point.
- The angles around those intersection points are labeled with numbers 1 through 16.
- Measurement of angle 3 is labeled as 110 degrees.
- Measurement of angle 12 is labeled as 55 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line DB and JL appear to be parallel
- Line CF and EG appear to be parallel
- Because these lines intersect and intersect transversals, there are several angle relationships that can be inferred: corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, alternate exterior angles, same-side interior angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle 3 is 110 degrees.
- The measure of angle 12 is 55 degrees.
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 13.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- I need to find the measure of angle 13.
- Since lines DB and JL aren't marked as parallel, I can't use corresponding, alternate interior, etc., angle rules.
- However, I can use angle properties from supplementary, vertical, or corresponding angle relationships to calculate angle 13.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all lines and their intersections
- Represent given angle measurements
- Represent supplementary angle relationships for angles on lines
- Represent what we know about the question - what we are trying to find
