PROBLEM 2655 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a square ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- The diagonal AC of the square is labeled with a length of 13.
- Side AD is labeled with the variable x.
- Angle ABC is labeled with the variable y degrees.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex D.
- All sides of the square are marked as congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a square, so all sides are congruent and all angles are right angles.
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle since angle BCD is a right angle and ABCD is a square.
- AC is a diagonal of the square.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AC = 13.
- Length of AD = x.
- All sides of square ABCD have equal length.
- All interior angles of square ABCD are 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of y.
- Since ABCD is a square, angle ABC is a right angle and equals 90 degrees.
- Also, the diagonal AC bisects the angle at B so angle y = 45

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the square, its sides, angles and congruence.
- Represent the right angle at vertex D.
- Represent the diagonal and its length.
- Represent the angle labeled y.
