PROBLEM 2529 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is labeled as x.
- Side BC is labeled as y.
- Side AC is labeled as 20.
- Angle ACB is labeled as 60 degrees.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.
- Angle ACB and BAC are complementary.
- cos(60) = BC/AC and sin(60) = AB/AC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = x (unknown)
- BC = y (unknown)
- AC = 20 (given)
- Angle ACB = 60 degrees (given)
- Angle ABC = 90 degrees
- sin(60) = x/20
- cos(60) = y/20

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of side AB.
- I can use trigonometric ratios to find x since the hypotenuse and one angle are known.
- Since sin(60) = x/20, then x = 20 * sin(60).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangle and its properties (right angle, vertices).
- Define the lengths of the sides.
- Define the measure of angle ACB.
- Establish the relationship between the sides and angle ACB using the sine function.
