PROBLEM 2624 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m \angle 9 = 2 x - 4, m \angle 10 = 2 x + 4. Find the measure of \angle 10.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see three lines intersecting at point C.
- These lines form angles 9 and 10.
- Line AB is a straight line.
- m \angle 9 = 2x - 4
- m \angle 10 = 2x + 4

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle 9 and an adjacent angle along line AB make a straight angle (180 degrees).
- Angle 10 and an adjacent angle along line AB also make a straight angle (180 degrees).
- Angles 9 and 10 are supplementary with another angle made by the intersection of line AB with the third line.
- Angles 9 and 10 are supplementary to each other with respect to the straight line AB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 9 = 2x - 4
- m \angle 10 = 2x + 4
- Since line AB is a straight line, angle 9 plus angle 10 equals 180 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 10.
- This requires setting up an equation and solving for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the lines, angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Represent the supplementary relationship of angle 9 and angle 10.
