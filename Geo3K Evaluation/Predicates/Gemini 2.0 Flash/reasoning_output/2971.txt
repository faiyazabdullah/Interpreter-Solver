PROBLEM 2971 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram to find b.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral WXYZ.
- The sides of the quadrilateral are labeled as follows: WX = b + 11, XY = 3a + 7, YZ = 2b, ZW = 4a.
- The vertices are labeled as W, X, Y, and Z.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral WXYZ is a parallelogram since opposite sides have expressions for their lengths. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length.
- Therefore, WX = YZ and XY = ZW.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = b + 11
- XY = 3a + 7
- YZ = 2b
- ZW = 4a
- Since WXYZ is a parallelogram, we have:
  - b + 11 = 2b
  - 3a + 7 = 4a

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of b using the properties of a parallelogram.
- The relationship b + 11 = 2b is needed.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and the parallelogram.
- Define the lengths of the sides.
- State that the opposite sides are equal because it is a parallelogram.
