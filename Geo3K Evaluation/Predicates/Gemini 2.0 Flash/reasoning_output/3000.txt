PROBLEM 3000 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A B C D is a rhombus. If P B = 12, A B = 15, and m \angle A B D = 24. Find m \angle B D A.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rhombus ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point P
- Side AB is marked as 15 units
- Segment PB is marked as 12 units
- Angle ABD is marked as 24 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rhombus
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, so P is the midpoint of AC and BD
- Diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles, so angle ABP = angle CBP and angle ADP = angle CDP
- All sides of a rhombus are equal in length, so AB = BC = CD = DA
- Opposite angles of a rhombus are equal, so angle DAB = angle BCD and angle ABC = angle ADC
- Adjacent angles of a rhombus are supplementary, so angle DAB + angle ABC = 180 degrees

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15 units (given)
- PB = 12 units (given)
- m \angle ABD = 24 degrees (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle BDA

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, diagonals, intersection point, measurements, and relationships
- Must include rhombus properties to solve
- We need predicates for rhombus, point, line, angle, length and angle measures, midpoint and equals
