PROBLEM 2522 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x if A E = 3, A B = 2, B C = 6, and E D = 2 x - 3.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, and E.
- There are lines connecting these points to form a pentagon.
- I can see measurements A E = 3, A B = 2, B C = 6, and E D = 2 x - 3.
- There are arrows on lines AB and CD, indicating that they are going in the same direction, therefore, they are parallel.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- There is a quadrilateral BCDE with lines BC and DE and CE and BD
- There is a triangle ABE
- Lines AB and CD are parallel

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AE = 3
- AB = 2
- BC = 6
- ED = 2x - 3
- These are lengths of the line segments.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x, given the lengths of A E, A B, B C and E D.
- I notice that triangle ABE and triangle CDE are similar triangles because of the angles that are created when parallel lines are intersected by another line.
- The ratios of corresponding sides are therefore equal.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the points, line segments, lengths, and the parallel relationship.
- Establish similarity between triangles ABE and CDE, because AB and CD are parallel, and AE and CE and BE and DE intersect these two sides
- Write equations based on the ratios of similar sides.
