PROBLEM 2996 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram P Q R S to find Q P.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram labeled P Q R S.
- The angle at vertex Q is labeled as 128 degrees.
- The length of side P S is labeled as 3.
- The length of side R S is labeled as 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and congruent.
- Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).
- Opposite angles in a parallelogram are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MeasureOf(Angle(P,Q,R)) = 128 degrees
- LengthOf(Line(P,S)) = 3
- LengthOf(Line(R,S)) = 5
- The question asks for the length of Q P.
- Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent, LengthOf(Line(R,S)) = LengthOf(Line(P,Q))
- And LengthOf(Line(P,S)) = LengthOf(Line(R,Q)).

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the length of side Q P.
- Since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal.
- We are given that R S is 5.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram.
- Represent the given angle and side lengths.
- Express the property that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
