PROBLEM 2759 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of \parallelogram J K L M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram JKLM with vertices labeled J, K, L, M
- Side ML is marked as 4 cm
- Side KL is marked as 7.2 cm
- There is a dashed line segment from J to a point E on ML, forming a right angle.
- The length of this segment JE is marked as 6 cm.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a parallelogram
- JE is perpendicular to ML, meaning JE is an altitude of the parallelogram with base ML
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ML = 4 cm (given)
- KL = 7.2 cm (given)
- JE = 6 cm (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram JKLM
- The area of a parallelogram is base times height
- The length of the base ML and the corresponding height JE are given

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, points, line segments, right angle, and given lengths.
- We need to define area of the parallelogram in terms of base and height.
