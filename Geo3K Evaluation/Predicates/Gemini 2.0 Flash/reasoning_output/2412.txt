PROBLEM 2412 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: J K L M is a rectangle. M L P R is a rhombus. \angle J M K \cong \angle R M P, m \angle J M K = 55, and m \angle M R P = 70. Find m \angle K M L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle JKLM and a rhombus MLPR.
- Points J, K, L, M, R, and P are labeled.
- Angles J, L, and K are right angles.
- Line segments JK, KL, LM, MJ form rectangle JKLM.
- Line segments ML, LP, PR, RM form rhombus MLPR.
- Angle JMK is congruent to angle RMP.
- The measure of angle JMK is 55 degrees.
- The measure of angle MRP is 70 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a rectangle, meaning opposite sides are parallel and all angles are right angles.
- MLPR is a rhombus, meaning all sides are congruent.
- Angle JMK is congruent to angle RMP, implying they have the same measure.
- Opposite angles of a rhombus are congruent, so angle MLP is congruent to angle MRP and their angle measures are equal.
- Adjacent angles of a rhombus are supplementary, so the sum of angle MRP and angle RML is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle JMK is 55 degrees.
- Measure of angle MRP is 70 degrees.
- Since JMKL is a rectangle, all its angles are right angles, therefore angle JKL = angle KLM = angle LMJ = angle MJK = 90 degrees.
- Since MLPR is a rhombus, ML = LP = PR = RM.
- Angle JMK is congruent to angle RMP, therefore the measure of angle RMP = 55 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle KML.
- We need to find the relationship between the given angles and angle KML.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the rectangle, rhombus, given angle measures, and congruence.
