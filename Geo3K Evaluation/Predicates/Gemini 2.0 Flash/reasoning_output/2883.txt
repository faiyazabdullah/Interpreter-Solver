Question: Find m \angle 3.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle TWXY, where TWXY are the vertices.
- Inside the rectangle, there is a line segment ZY, where Z is a point on the line segment TW.
- Inside the rectangle, there is a line segment ZW, where Z is a point on the line segment TY.
- Angle TYX is marked as 90 degrees. Angle TWX is marked as 90 degrees.
- Angle TYZ measures 52 degrees. Angle YZT measures 90 degrees.
- Angle ZYW measures 38 degrees.
- Angle WTZ is labeled as angle 4. Angle YTZ is labeled as angle 1.
- Angle ZWX is labeled as angle 2. Angle ZWT is labeled as angle 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- TWXY is a rectangle, which means that TW is parallel to YX, and TY is parallel to WX.
- Also, TW is perpendicular to TY, YX is perpendicular to WX, TW is perpendicular to WX, and TY is perpendicular to YX.
- Triangle TYZ is a right triangle. Triangle ZWX is a right triangle.
- ZY is perpendicular to TZ. ZW is perpendicular to ZW.
- The sum of angles in triangle TYZ is 180 degrees. The sum of angles in triangle ZWX is 180 degrees.
- Since TWXY is a rectangle, angle XYT is 90 degrees, angle TWX is 90 degrees, angle WXY is 90 degrees and angle YXT is 90 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle TYZ = 52 degrees
- Measure of angle ZYW = 38 degrees
- Measure of angle YZT = 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 3 (ZWT).
- In triangle YTZ, since the sum of the angles is 180 degrees and we know angle TYZ is 52 and YZT is 90, we can find angle 1 (YTZ). Angle 1 = 180 - 90 - 52 = 38 degrees.
- Since TWXY is a rectangle, TW is parallel to YX and TY is parallel to WX. Therefore, angle TYW is 90 degrees. We know angle ZYW is 38 degrees, therefore angle TYZ is 52 degrees.
- In triangle ZWX, angle ZWX = 90, and we know that TWXY is a rectangle, so angle TWX = 90. In triangle ZYW, angle YZW = 90, and angle ZYW = 38, so angle ZWY = 90.
- We can determine angle 2 since angle ZWX is 90 degrees. Angle 2 + angle ZWY must equal 90 degrees, so angle 2 + 38 = 90, which means angle 2 = 52.
- Since angle TWX is 90, angle 3 = 90 - angle 2, so angle 3 = 90 - 52 = 38 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We will use predicates to define the rectangle, its vertices, lines, right angles, the triangles, given angle measurements and relationships within the rectangle and the triangle to represent the figure.
