PROBLEM 2619 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral E F G H is a rectangle. If F K = 32 feet, find E G.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral E F G H with vertices labeled E, F, G, H.
- The diagonals of the quadrilateral are intersecting at a point K.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex H.
- FK = 32 feet

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral E F G H is a rectangle
- Diagonals of the rectangle bisect each other, therefore K is the midpoint of EG and FH.
- Therefore, EK = KG and FK = KH. Also EG = FH.
- Since FK = 32 feet, then FH = 64 feet.
- Since EG = FH, then EG = 64 feet

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FK = 32 feet (given)
- Since E F G H is a rectangle, then the diagonals are equal.
- Therefore, FH = EG

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of EG.
- Since E F G H is a rectangle, FH = EG
- FK = KH
- FH = FK + KH = 2 * FK

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle, intersection point, measurements and relationships.
- Express the relationship between the diagonals and their segments.
