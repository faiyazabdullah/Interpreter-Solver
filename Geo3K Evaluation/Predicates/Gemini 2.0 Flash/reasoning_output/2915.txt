PROBLEM 2915 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot O, E C and A B are diameters, and \angle B O D \cong \angle D O E \cong \angle E O F \cong \angle F O A. Find m \widehat A D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, and F lie on the circle.
- Lines OC, OB, OD, OE, OF, and OA are radii of the circle.
- Line EC and AB are diameters of the circle.
- Angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since EC is a diameter, angle EOC is a straight angle.
- Since AB is a diameter, angle AOB is a straight angle.
- Since angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA are congruent, they have the same measure.
- The sum of angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA is 360 degrees.
- Angle BOC is a right angle.
- Arc AD is the arc subtended by angle AOD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measures of angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA are equal.
- Angle BOC is a right angle, so its measure is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc AD.
- To find the measure of arc AD, we need to find the measure of the central angle AOD, which is the sum of angles AOF, FOE, EOD, and DOB.
-Since angle FOA, EOD, EOF, and BOD are congruent, the angle AOD is equal to the sum of the angles DOE, EOF, FOA and BOD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define all points, lines, and angles.
- Need to represent the congruence of angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA.
- Need to represent that EC and AB are diameters.
- Need to represent that BOC is a right angle.
