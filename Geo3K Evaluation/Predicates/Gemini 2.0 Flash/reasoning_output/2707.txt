PROBLEM 2707 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram ABCD.
- Point E is on line AB.
- CE is perpendicular to AB.
- The length of CD is 15 inches.
- The length of BC is 13 inches.
- The length of BE is 5 inches.
- Angle CEB is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, so AB is parallel to CD, and BC is parallel to AD.
- CE is the altitude (height) of the parallelogram with base AB.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD.
- AE = AB - BE

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CD = 15 inches
- BC = 13 inches
- BE = 5 inches

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- The area of a parallelogram is base * height.
- The base is AB = CD = 15 inches.
- The height is CE.
- We can find CE using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle CEB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, points, lines, right angle, and given measurements.
- We need to represent AB = CD.
- We need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find CE.
- Area of parallelogram = AB * CE = CD * CE
