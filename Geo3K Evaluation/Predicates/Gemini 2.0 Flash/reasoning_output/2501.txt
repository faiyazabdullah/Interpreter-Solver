PROBLEM 2501 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \triangle P Q R, S T \parallel R Q. If P S = 12.5, S R = 5, and P T = 15, find T Q.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle PQR with vertices labeled P, Q, R.
- There is a line segment ST inside the triangle.
- Points S and T lie on sides PR and PQ respectively.
- There are parallel markings on line segments ST and RQ.
- PS = 12.5, SR = 5, PT = 15.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ST is parallel to RQ.
- Triangle PST is similar to triangle PQR (due to the parallel lines).
- PS + SR = PR, PT + TQ = PQ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- PS = 12.5
- SR = 5
- PT = 15
- We need to find TQ.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the length of TQ.
- Since ST || RQ, we can use the property that PS/SR = PT/TQ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent triangle PQR, points P, Q, R, S, T, lines ST, RQ, PS, SR, PT, TQ.
- Represent the parallel relationship ST || RQ.
- Represent the given lengths PS = 12.5, SR = 5, PT = 15.
- Express the similarity relationship between triangles PST and PQR.
- Include the relationship derived from similarity PS/SR = PT/TQ.
