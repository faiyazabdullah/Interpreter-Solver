PROBLEM 2841 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Express the ratio of \cos A as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 15 units.
- Side BC is marked as 20 units.
- Side AC is marked as 25 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with the right angle at B.
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AC is the hypotenuse.
- Angle A is an acute angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15 units (given)
- BC = 20 units (given)
- AC = 25 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of cos A
- cos A is Adjacent / Hypotenuse
- Adjacent side to angle A is AB
- Hypotenuse is AC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and trigonometric relationships.
- Must define the value of sides in relation to angle A for cosine function.
