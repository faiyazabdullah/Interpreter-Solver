PROBLEM 2838 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If P R \parallel K L, K N = 9, L N = 16, P M = 2 K P, find P R.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points K, L, M, N, P, Q, R.
- I can see lines KL, LM, MK, PR, NQ, MN.
- I can see a triangle KLM.
- I can see right angles at N and M.
- I see that PR is parallel to KL.
- I see that Q is on MN.
- I see that P is on MK.
- I see that R is on LM.
- I see that N is on KL.
- I see that Q is on PR.
- I am given that KN = 9 and LN = 16.
- I am given that PM = 2KP.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since PR is parallel to KL and NQ is perpendicular to KL, NQ is perpendicular to PR.
- Since MN is perpendicular to KL, MN is an altitude of triangle KLM.
- Since MN is perpendicular to PR, MN is an altitude of triangle MPR.
- I am given PM = 2KP, so MP/KP = 2.
- KL is parallel to PR implies triangle KLM is similar to triangle RPM.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- KN = 9
- LN = 16
- KL = KN + LN = 9 + 16 = 25
- PM = 2KP

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- I need to find PR.
- I need to use the similarity of the triangles KLM and RPM.
- The ratio of the sides must be equal: PR/KL = MP/MK.
- MK = MP + PK = 2KP + KP = 3KP, so MP/MK = 2KP/3KP = 2/3.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, and triangles.
- State that PR is parallel to KL.
- State the given lengths KN = 9 and LN = 16.
- Calculate KL = KN + LN.
- State that PM = 2KP.
- Establish the similarity between triangle KLM and triangle RPM.
- State the ratio MP/MK = 2/3.
- Relate PR/KL = MP/MK.
