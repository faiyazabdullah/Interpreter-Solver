PROBLEM 2973 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two triangles: Triangle ABC and Triangle DEF.
- In Triangle ABC, side AB is labeled 'x', side BC is labeled '5', and side AC is not labeled.
- In Triangle DEF, side EF is labeled '3', side DE is labeled 'x-4', and side DF is not labeled.
- Angle A and Angle D have the same angle mark (single arc).
- Angle B and Angle E have the same angle mark (double arc).
- Angle C and Angle F have the same angle mark (triple arc).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC and Triangle DEF are similar because they have the same angle measures (AA similarity).
- Since the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = x
- BC = 5
- EF = 3
- DE = x - 4

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AB, which is represented by the variable x.
- Since Triangle ABC and Triangle DEF are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. We can set up a proportion relating the side lengths.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangles ABC and DEF.
- State that Angle A and Angle D are congruent.
- State that Angle B and Angle E are congruent.
- Define lengths of AB, BC, EF, and DE
- State that Triangle ABC and Triangle DEF are similar.
- Define the ratios of the corresponding sides based on similarity.
