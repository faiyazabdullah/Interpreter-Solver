PROBLEM 2927 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The area of trapezoid J K L M is 138 square feet. The area of trapezoid Q R S T is 5.52 square feet. If trapezoid J K L M \sim trapezoid Q R S T, find the value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two trapezoids: JKLM and QRST.
- The length of JK is given as 5 ft.
- The length of QT is given as x.
- The area of trapezoid JKLM is 138 sq ft.
- The area of trapezoid QRST is 5.52 sq ft.
- Trapezoid JKLM is similar to trapezoid QRST.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid JKLM and QRST are similar trapezoids.
- JK and QT are corresponding sides since they are the top base of the trapezoids.
- The ratio of corresponding sides is constant.
- The ratio of areas of similar figures is the square of the ratio of corresponding sides.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of JK = 5 ft.
- Length of QT = x ft.
- Area of trapezoid JKLM = 138 sq ft.
- Area of trapezoid QRST = 5.52 sq ft.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of x.
- The trapezoids are similar, so the ratio of the areas is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding sides.
- This information can be used to create an equation to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define trapezoids JKLM and QRST.
- Define the points J, K, L, M, Q, R, S, T.
- Define the lines JK, KL, LM, MJ, QR, RS, ST, TQ.
- Define the lengths of JK and QT.
- Define the areas of both trapezoids.
- State that the trapezoids are similar.
- State the relationship between the ratio of areas and the ratio of sides.
