PROBLEM 2667 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle D A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- There is a point F where the diagonals intersect.
- Side AD has a length of 13.
- Side DC has a length of 10.
- Side AB has a length of 3y-8.
- Side BC has a length of 2x+7.
- Angle ADB has a measure of 59 degrees.
- Angle ABF has a measure of 20 degrees.
- Angle BFC has a measure of 49 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. Also opposite angles are equal.
- The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
- Angles AFB and CFD are vertical angles and therefore congruent. Angles BFC and AFD are vertical angles and therefore congruent.
- AD is parallel to BC. Therefore angle ADB and angle DBC are alternate interior angles and congruent.
- AB is parallel to DC. Therefore angle ABD and angle BDC are alternate interior angles and congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 13
- DC = 10
- AB = 3y - 8
- BC = 2x + 7
- m<ADB = 59
- m<ABF = 20
- m<BFC = 49

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is to find m<DAB.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Meaning that the sum of angle DAB and angle ADC equals 180.
- Angle ADC is equal to the sum of angle ADB (59 degrees) and angle BDC.
- To solve this, we first need to find angle BDC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram, points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- State the properties of a parallelogram, e.g. opposite sides are parallel and equal, diagonals bisect each other.
- Capture the relationships between the angles, e.g. adjacent angles are supplementary.
- Set up the necessary equations based on the information provided.
