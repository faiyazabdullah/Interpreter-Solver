PROBLEM 2507 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x if \triangle J L M \sim \triangle Q S T.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, \triangle JLM and \triangle TQS.
- In \triangle JLM, JL = 3y-2, JM = 4, LM = 6x-3.
- In \triangle TQS, TQ = 2, TS = 3, QS = 5.
- Angle J is congruent to angle T.
- Angle M is congruent to angle T.
- Angle Q is congruent to angle M.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \triangle JLM is similar to \triangle TQS.
- Since \triangle JLM \sim \triangle TQS, corresponding sides are proportional, i.e., JL/TQ = JM/TS = LM/QS.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JL = 3y-2, TQ = 2
- JM = 4, TS = 3
- LM = 6x-3, QS = 5
- Ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find x, so we need to use the ratio with LM and QS.
- JM/TS = LM/QS gives us an equation for x: 4/3 = (6x-3)/5

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangles.
- Define the lengths of sides.
- Define the congruence of the angles.
- Define the similarity of the triangles.
- Define the ratio of corresponding sides.
