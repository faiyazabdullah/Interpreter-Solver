PROBLEM 2830 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three parallel lines intersected by two transversals.
- The parallel lines are labeled as GK, LJ, and DA.
- The transversals are labeled as FN and PM.
- Some segment lengths are given: OB = 7x - 2, HE = 8, CJ = 8, BH = 4x + 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line GK is parallel to line LJ.
- Line LJ is parallel to line DA.
- Therefore, line GK is parallel to line DA.
- By the Parallel Lines Proportionality Theorem (also known as Intercept Theorem), the segments on the transversals are proportional. That is, OB/BH = CJ/JE.
- JE = HE = 8

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- OB = 7x - 2
- BH = 4x + 3
- CJ = 8
- HE = 8
- JE = 8

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Using the parallel lines proportionality theorem OB/BH = CJ/JE, we can set up the equation: (7x - 2) / (4x + 3) = 8/8 = 1.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the parallel lines.
- Define the transversals.
- Define the points on the lines.
- Define the lengths of the segments.
- Set up the equation based on the parallel lines proportionality theorem.
