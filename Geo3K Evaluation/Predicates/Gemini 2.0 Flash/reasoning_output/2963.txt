PROBLEM 2963 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, C P is an altitude, C Q is the angle bisector of \angle A C B, and R is the midpoint of A B. Find m \angle A C Q if m \angle A C B = 123 - x and m \angle Q C B = 42 + x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- There are points P, Q, and R on the line segment AB.
- CP is an altitude, CQ is the angle bisector of angle ACB, and R is the midpoint of AB.
- m∠ACB = 123 - x and m∠QCB = 42 + x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- CP is perpendicular to AB, meaning angle CPA is a right angle.
- CQ bisects angle ACB, meaning angle ACQ is congruent to angle QCB.
- R is the midpoint of AB, meaning AR is congruent to RB.
- Since CQ bisects angle ACB, m∠ACQ = m∠QCB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠ACB = 123 - x
- m∠QCB = 42 + x
- Therefore, m∠ACQ = 42 + x
- Also, m∠ACQ + m∠QCB = m∠ACB.
- Substituting the given expressions, (42 + x) + (42 + x) = 123 - x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find m∠ACQ.
- We can use the information provided about the angle bisector and angle ACB to establish an equation to find the value of x.
- Once we find x, we can substitute it into the expression for m∠ACQ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangle, points, and lines.
- State the given angle measurements.
- State that CP is an altitude.
- State that CQ is an angle bisector.
- State that R is the midpoint of AB.
- Define the relationships based on these facts.
