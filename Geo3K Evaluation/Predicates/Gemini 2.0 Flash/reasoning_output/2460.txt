PROBLEM 2460 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round the angle measure to the nearest degree.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- The side lengths are given as follows: AC = 29, AB = 61, BC = 50.
- There is an angle x at vertex C.
- There is a right angle at vertex A, therefore triangle ABC is a right triangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at A.
- Sides AC and AB are perpendicular.
- Side BC is the hypotenuse.
- We need to find the measure of angle x, which is angle ACB.
- We can use trigonometric ratios to find the angle x. Since we know the lengths of AC and BC, we can use the cosine function.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 29
- AB = 61
- BC = 50
- Angle x = Angle ACB

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle x.
- We can use the cosine function, where Cos(x) = Adjacent/Hypotenuse.
- In this case, Cos(x) = AC/BC = 29/50.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle.
- Represent the right angle.
- Represent the given side lengths.
- Represent the cosine relationship.
- Represent that the angle we are looking for is Angle ACB.
