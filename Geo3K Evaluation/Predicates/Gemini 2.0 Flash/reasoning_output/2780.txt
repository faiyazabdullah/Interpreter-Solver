PROBLEM 2780 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find \angle 9.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with center D.
- I see two lines AB and BC that are tangent to the circle at points E and B respectively.
- The external angle formed by extending AB and BC is given as 120 degrees.
- Angle 9 is indicated at point B.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AB and BC are tangent to the circle, the radii DE and DB are perpendicular to AB and BC respectively.
- Quadrilateral DEBC is formed.
- The sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
- Angle ABC is the supplementary angle to the given external angle of 120 degrees, so angle ABC is 180 - 120 = 60 degrees.
- Angle DEB and angle DBC are both right angles (90 degrees).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- External angle = 120 degrees.
- Angle ABC = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees
- Angle DEB = Angle DBC = 90 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 9, which is the same as angle DBC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and lines.
- State that AB and BC are tangent to circle D at E and B respectively
- State that DE and DB are radii of circle D
- State that DE is perpendicular to AB and DB is perpendicular to BC
- Calculate angle ABC as the supplement to the 120-degree angle.
- Express the sum of angles in the quadrilateral.
- State that angle 9 is the same as angle DBC
