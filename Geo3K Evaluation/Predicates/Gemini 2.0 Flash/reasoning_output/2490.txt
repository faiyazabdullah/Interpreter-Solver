PROBLEM 2490 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.
- Angle BEC is labeled 55 degrees.
- Angle BCA is labeled 60 degrees.
- Angle DBC is labeled 5y degrees.
- Line segment BE is labeled 3x - 6.
- Line segment DE is labeled x + 4.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The question asks to find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
- The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, if the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then BE = DE.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BE = 3x - 6
- DE = x + 4
- To be a parallelogram, BE = DE

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to equate the expressions for BE and DE and solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, quadrilateral, lines, and measurements.
- Represent the relationship that BE = DE for the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram.
