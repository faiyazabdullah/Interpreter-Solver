PROBLEM 2802 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle C A D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, and D.
- There are line segments AD, AC, DC, and CB.
- I can see angle ADC, labeled as 92 degrees.
- Line segment AD has a double tick mark, and line segment DC has a double tick mark. This indicates that AD and DC are congruent.
- Line segment AC has a single tick mark, and line segment CB has a single tick mark. This indicates that AC and CB are congruent.
- There is a triangle ADB.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AD and DC are congruent, Triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle.
- Since AC and CB are congruent, Triangle ACB is an isosceles triangle.
- Angle ADC is given as 92 degrees. Therefore angle ACD = angle DAC = (180 - 92)/2 = 88/2 = 44 degrees.
- Triangle ACB is an isosceles triangle, so angle CAB = angle ABC.
- Angle ACB + Angle ACD = Angle BCD = 180 degrees, since DCB is a straight line. Therefore angle ACB = 180 - 44 = 136 degrees.
- In Triangle ACB, angle CAB + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees.
- Angle CAB + angle ABC + 136 = 180
- 2 * angle CAB = 44.
- Angle CAB = 22 degrees.
- Angle CAD + Angle CAB = angle DAB. Angle CAD = 44.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ADC = 92 degrees.
- AD = DC
- AC = CB

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m \angle C A D. Since Triangle ADC is an isosceles triangle and angle ADC is 92 degrees, angles CAD and ACD are equal to (180 - 92)/2 = 44 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points, lines, and angles.
- State that AD = DC and AC = CB.
- State that angle ADC = 92.
