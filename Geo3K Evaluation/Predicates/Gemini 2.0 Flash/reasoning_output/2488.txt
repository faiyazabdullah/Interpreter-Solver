PROBLEM 2488 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the scale factor from W to W'.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a square with vertices A, B, W, W'.
- The diagram also has a point F on the extension of line segment W'W.
- There is a small right triangle next to F.
- Length of WW' is labelled as 8.
- Length of FW is labelled as 12.
- There are dashed lines extending from A, B, F, and W.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- A, B, W', W form a square, meaning all sides are equal in length and all angles are 90 degrees.
- F, W', and W are collinear.
- The segment FW has length 12, which is the sum of the length FW' and W'W.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WW' = 8
- FW = 12
- FW' + W'W = FW, therefore, FW' = FW - W'W = 12 - 8 = 4

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the scale factor from W to W'. This means we need to know the ratio of a length on the smaller shape (formed by the smaller right triangle) to the corresponding length on the larger shape (the square). Since the square has sides of length 8, and the distance FW' is 4, and FW is 12.
Since the square has sides equal to 8, and we have found the value FW' = 4, then x = 4. Therefore the small right triangle has side length 4 and the side length of square W to side length of small right triangle W' is 8:4.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points A, B, W, W', F.
- Define the square.
- Define collinearity of F, W', and W.
- Define lengths FW and WW'.
- Calculate FW'.
- Define the scale factor as the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides.
