PROBLEM 2783 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the length of \widehat J K. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center C.
- Points A, J, and K lie on the circle.
- Line segment AJ is a diameter of the circle.
- Line segments CK and CJ are radii of the circle.
- The length of radius CJ is given as 15 cm.
- The angle KCA measures 105 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AJ is a diameter, angle ACJ is a straight angle, measuring 180 degrees.
- CK and CJ are radii of the same circle, therefore they are congruent.
- The arc JK subtends the central angle JCK.
- Angle JCK = 180 degrees - Angle KCA = 180 degrees - 105 degrees = 75 degrees

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 15 cm.
- Central angle JCK is 75 degrees.
- The circumference of the circle is 2 * pi * radius = 2 * pi * 15 = 30 * pi cm.
- The length of arc JK is a fraction of the circumference.
- The fraction is (central angle / 360 degrees) = 75/360 = 5/24

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of arc JK.
- The length of arc JK is (5/24) * (30 * pi).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the circle, points, lines, and measurements.
- Express the relationships between radius, diameter, central angle, and arc length.
- Include relationships to calculate the arc length.
