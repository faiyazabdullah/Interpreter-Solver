PROBLEM 2603 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If L K = 4, M P = 3, P Q = 6, K J = 2, R S = 6, and L P = 2, find J H.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a geometric figure with points H, J, K, L, M, S, R, Q, P.
- There are lines connecting these points: HS, HM, JR, KQ, LP.
- The lines JR, KQ, LP, HS are parallel.
- There is a line segment SM.
- There are labels for the points.
- The lengths LK = 4, MP = 3, PQ = 6, KJ = 2, RS = 6, LP = 2 are given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The lines HS, JR, KQ, LP are parallel. This implies that the triangles formed are similar.
- Triangle HSM is the largest triangle.
- Other triangles are formed within this triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LK = 4, MP = 3, PQ = 6, KJ = 2, RS = 6, LP = 2
- We need to find JH.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of JH.
- By using similar triangles and proportional side lengths, we can find JH.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all the points.
- Define all the lines connecting the points.
- Specify parallel lines.
- Specify the lengths of the given line segments.
- Specify that the triangles formed are similar.
