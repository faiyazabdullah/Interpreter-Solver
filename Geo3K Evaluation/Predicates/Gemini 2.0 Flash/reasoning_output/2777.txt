PROBLEM 2777 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a figure comprising three points A, B, and L, and F
- I can see three lines: Line(L, A), Line(A, F), and Line(L, B, F)
- There are two right angles: Angle(L, A, F) and Angle(L, B, A)
- There are lengths indicated: Length(L, B) is 2*sqrt(3), Length(L, A) is sqrt(3), length of Line(B,F) is x, length of Line(A,F) is z, length of Line(A,B) is y

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle LAF is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Triangle LAB is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Line LB and Line BF form Line LF
- Line AB and Line BF form Line AF

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(Line(L, B)) = 2*sqrt(3)
- LengthOf(Line(L, A)) = sqrt(3)
- LengthOf(Line(B, F)) = x
- LengthOf(Line(A, F)) = z
- LengthOf(Line(A, B)) = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of z
- Need to establish relationships between the given sides of the right triangles

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the points, lines, triangles, and right angles
- Need to represent the given lengths
- Need to use the Pythagorean theorem for both right triangles
