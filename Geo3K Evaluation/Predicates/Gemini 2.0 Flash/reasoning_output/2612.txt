PROBLEM 2612 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three horizontal parallel lines labeled AJ, MF, and LK.
- There are two lines intersecting these parallel lines: DG and IO.
- The line DG intersects the three horizontal lines at points E, H, and P, respectively.
- The line IO intersects the three horizontal lines at points B, N, and C, respectively.
- I see the following lengths marked on the lines: EH = 20-5x, HP = 2x+6, BN = y, NC = (3/5)y + 2
- There are congruent marks on EH and HP. This means EH = HP.
- Similarly, there are congruent marks on BN and NC. This means BN = NC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since lines AJ, MF, and LK are parallel, and DG and IO intersect them, we can use the properties of parallel lines cut by transversals.
- From the congruent marks, we know EH = HP and BN = NC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- EH = 20-5x
- HP = 2x+6
- BN = y
- NC = (3/5)y + 2

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of y.
- Since BN = NC, we can set up an equation: y = (3/5)y + 2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallel lines.
- Represent the points on the lines.
- Represent the line segments and their lengths.
- Represent the congruence of the line segments.
- Set up the equation relating y and (3/5)y + 2.
