PROBLEM 2502 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 4.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify triangle ABC.
- I can see point D.
- Line AD extends from line AB.
- Angle DAB is labeled 123 degrees.
- There is a right angle at vertex C.
- Side AB has a length of 4.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.
- Angles CAB and DAB form a linear pair (supplementary angles).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle DAB = 123 degrees.
- AB = 4.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking to find the measure of angle 4.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, triangle, lines, and angles.
- Represent the right angle at C.
- Represent the measurement of angle DAB as 123 degrees.
- Represent the length of side AB as 4.
- Represent the fact that angles CAB and DAB are supplementary.
