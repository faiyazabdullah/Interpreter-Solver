PROBLEM 2639 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find Q M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two lines NA and NB which form an angle at point N.
- Point M lies on line NB and point P lies on line NA.
- MQ is a line segment from point M to point Q.
- PQ is a line segment from point P to point Q.
- There is a right angle at point M, meaning line segment MQ is perpendicular to line NB.
- There is a right angle at point P, meaning line segment PQ is perpendicular to line NA.
- The length of line segment MQ is represented by 2x + 2.
- The length of line segment PQ is represented by 4x - 8.
- Line segment NQ bisects the angle formed by lines NA and NB.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- MQ is perpendicular to NB.
- PQ is perpendicular to NA.
- NQ bisects the angle formed by lines NA and NB.
- Since NQ bisects the angle ANB and MQ and PQ are perpendicular to the sides of that angle, we can deduce that MQ = PQ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MQ = 2x + 2
- PQ = 4x - 8

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is to find the length of QM which is equivalent to finding the length of MQ.
- Since we know that MQ = PQ we can set them equal to solve for x.
- Then we can substitute the value of x into the expression for MQ (2x + 2) to find the answer.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all lines, points, angles.
- We need to represent the perpendicular relationships.
- We need to represent the angle bisector.
- We need to represent the length measurements.
- We need to represent that MQ and PQ are equal.
