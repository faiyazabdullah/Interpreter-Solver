PROBLEM 2416 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points A, B, D, E, F, G, and H.
- There are lines intersecting at points A and B.
- There are angles labeled as (8y+2)°, (25y-20)°, and 10x°.
- Lines DE and CF have arrows indicating direction, which suggests that they could be parallel.
- The angles (8y+2)° and (25y-20)° seem to be consecutive interior angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- If lines DE and CF are parallel, then the consecutive interior angles (8y+2)° and (25y-20)° are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurements given are angles: (8y+2)° and (25y-20)°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks us to find y.
- We can find y by setting the sum of the two consecutive interior angles equal to 180° and solving for y.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the points, lines, and angles.
- We need to define the Parallel relationship
- We need to set up an equation that expresses the supplementary relationship.
