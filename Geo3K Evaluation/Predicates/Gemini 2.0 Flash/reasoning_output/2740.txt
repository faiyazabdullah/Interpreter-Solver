PROBLEM 2740 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot S, m \widehat P Q R = 98. Find m \widehat P Q.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center S.
- There are points P, Q, R, and T on the circle or within the circle.
- There is a line segment PR which is a chord of the circle.
- There is a line segment QT which is perpendicular to PR.
- There is a numerical value of 6 shown alongside the line segment TR.
- Arc PQR is labeled as 98 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point S is the center of the circle.
- PR is a chord of the circle.
- QT is a line segment that intersects PR at T and is perpendicular to PR.
- Since QT is perpendicular to PR, T is the midpoint of PR. Therefore, PT = TR.
- Since m \widehat P Q R = 98, it represents the measure of arc PQR.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of TR is 6.
- m \widehat P Q R = 98.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc PQ.
- Since T is the midpoint of PR, and TR = 6, therefore PR = 12.
- Since T is the midpoint of PR, arc PT = arc TR.
- m arc(PR) = m arc(PQ) + m arc(QR). Since m arc(PQR) = 98, m arc(PR) = 98- m arc(PQ).
- Since T is the midpoint of PR, m \widehat P T = m \widehat T R, which means the subtended arcs have equal measure.
- Therefore, arc PR has equal measures to arcs PT and TR and PT = TR.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and all points.
- Define the lines.
- Define perpendicularity.
- Define the midpoint relationship.
- Define the measure of the arc.
- Define that PT = TR since T is the midpoint.
- Define arc relationships.
