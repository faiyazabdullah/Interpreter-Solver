PROBLEM 2600 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- The length of side DB is labeled as 16.
- The length of side BD is labeled as 8.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- The length of side BC is labeled as x.
- There is an angle y at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle.
- Angle ABC is a right angle.
- Triangle BCD is a right triangle with right angle at B.
- DB is the hypotenuse of triangle DBC.
- BC and BD are the legs of triangle DBC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of DB = 16
- Length of BD = 8
- Length of BC = x
- Angle at vertex C = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x.
- Triangle DBC is a right triangle.
- Applying the Pythagorean theorem may be relevant.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, the right triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Include Pythagorean relationship for solving.
