PROBLEM 2433 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is labeled as y units
- Side BC is labeled as 17 units
- Side AB is labeled as x units
- Angle ACB is 60 degrees
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse
- Angle ACB is given to be 60 degrees.
- Angle ABC must be 30 degrees since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = y units
- AC = x units
- BC = 17 units
- Measure of angle ACB = 60 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x.
- I will need to use trigonometric ratios.
- I can use cos(60) = AC/BC or cos(60) = x/17.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and trigonometric ratios.
- Include cos(60).
