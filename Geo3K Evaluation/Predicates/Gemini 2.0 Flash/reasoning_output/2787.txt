PROBLEM 2787 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \widehat Q T S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- Points Q, A, and S lie on the circle.
- Line RS is tangent to the circle at point S.
- Line RQ is a secant to the circle.
- Angle ARS is given as 71 degrees.
- Angle QAS is given as 106 degrees.
- Arc QTS is the arc we need to find.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- RS is tangent to circle B at point S, so angle RSA can be used.
- RQ is a secant to circle B.
- Angle ARS is an exterior angle formed by the tangent and secant.
- The measure of angle ARS is half the difference of the intercepted arcs AS and AQ.
- The measure of angle QAS is an inscribed angle and is equal to half the measure of intercepted arc QS.
- The measure of arc QS is twice the measure of angle QAS.
- The complete circle has a measure of 360 degrees. The arc QTS is 360 - arc QS.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ARS = 71 degrees
- Angle QAS = 106 degrees
- Measure of arc QS = 2 * 106 = 212 degrees.
- Let measure of arc AS be x.
- (Measure arc AS - Measure arc AQ) / 2 = 71.
-  x - Measure arc AQ = 142.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is to find the measure of arc QTS.
- We can find the measure of arc QS since we have angle QAS.
- Measure of arc QTS = 360 - Measure of arc QS.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles, and circle.
- Specify which points lie on which lines/circle.
- Specify the measures of the angles.
- Represent the relationship between inscribed angle QAS and arc QS.
- Represent the relationship that QTS and QS together make a complete circle.
- Tangent and Secant definitions.
