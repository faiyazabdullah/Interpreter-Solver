================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 3 if m \angle 4 = m \angle 5.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.
- There are lines connecting these points, forming triangles and a straight line.
- I can see angles with the following measures: 63°, 69°, 47°, and 136°.
- There are line segments with the following lengths: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Angle 1 and Angle 69 are adjacent angles sharing a vertex at F.
- Angle 136 degrees is at point A and forms a straight line with another unknown angle at A.
- m∠4 = m∠5

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points B, F, and A lie on a straight line, as do points A and G.
- Therefore, ∠1, ∠4 and ∠5 together form a triangle.
- ∠1 and 69° are supplementary, as they make a straight line.
- ∠A and 136° are supplementary as they are a linear pair.
- m∠4 = m∠5, which implies that triangle BFC is isosceles, meaning Line(B,F) is of different length than Line(F,C)

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(Line(B,F)) = 1 + 2 = 3.
- LengthOf(Line(F,A)) = 3 + 6 = 9
- We are given m∠E = 63°, m∠BFE = 69°, m∠DFA = 47°, m∠FAG = 136°.
- Also LengthOf(Line(B,E)) = 2, LengthOf(Line(B,C)) = 5, LengthOf(Line(F,C)) = 4, LengthOf(Line(D,F)) = 7, LengthOf(Line(D,A)) = 6, LengthOf(Line(B,F)) = LengthOf(Line(B,1)) + LengthOf(Line(1,F))

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of ∠3.
- ∠3 is an interior angle of triangle FBC.
- We are given m∠4 = m∠5.
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°.
- Because m∠4 = m∠5, we can say m∠4 = m∠5 = x.
- Also 47+ angle 3 +x +x = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define points, lines, angles, and triangles
- Need to represent the given measurements
- Need to capture that angles form a straight line
- Need to express that m∠4 = m∠5
- Need to include the angle sum property of triangles
