PROBLEM 2697 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If A B \parallel D C, find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- Angle at vertex D is labeled as 65 degrees.
- Angle at vertex A is labeled as x degrees.
- There are arrows on lines AB and DC, indicating that they are parallel.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram since AB is parallel to DC.
- Angles A and D are consecutive interior angles.
- Since AB is parallel to DC, angles A and D are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle D = 65 degrees (given).
- Angle A = x degrees (unknown).

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We know that the sum of angles A and D is 180 degrees.
- We can use this information to find the value of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, the parallel lines, the given angle measurements, and the relationship between consecutive interior angles.
