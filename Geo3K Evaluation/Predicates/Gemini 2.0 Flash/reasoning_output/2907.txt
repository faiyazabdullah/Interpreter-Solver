PROBLEM 2907 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle J K L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points K, J, L, M, A, B, and C.
- I can identify lines KA, KB, KC, KL, JL, and LM.
- I can see angles JKL, KLM, and JKA.
- I can see that angle KJL and angle KML are right angles.
- Line segment JL is marked congruent to LM.
- Angle BKA is marked as 37 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- KL bisects angle AKB since JL is perpendicular to AK, LM is perpendicular to KB, and JL is congruent to LM.
- Since KL bisects angle AKB, angles JKL and LKM are congruent.
- Since KL bisects angle AKB, MeasureOf(Angle(JKL)) = MeasureOf(Angle(LKM)).
- Angle JKA is part of angle AKB, and angle CKB is part of angle AKB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle AKB = 37 degrees.
- JL = LM

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle JKL.
- Since KL bisects angle AKB, we need to find MeasureOf(Angle(LKM)).
- MeasureOf(Angle(JKL)) = 1/2 * MeasureOf(Angle(BKA)).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Represent the right angles at J and M.
- Represent the congruency of JL and LM.
- Represent the measure of angle AKB.
- Represent the angle bisector KL.
- Represent that angle JKL is half of angle BKA.
