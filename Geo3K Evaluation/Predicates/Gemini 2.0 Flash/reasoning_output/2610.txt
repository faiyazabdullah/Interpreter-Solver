PROBLEM 2610 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 12 units.
- Side AC is marked as y units.
- Side BC is marked as x units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.
- Angle A is marked as 60 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Since angle A is 60 degrees and angle C is 90 degrees, angle B is 30 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12 units (given)
- AC = y units (unknown)
- BC = x units (unknown)
- Angle A = 60 degrees (given)
- Angle C = 90 degrees (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of y, which is the length of side AC.
- Since we have a right triangle and the length of the hypotenuse, and an angle, we can use trigonometric ratios to solve for y.
- We know that cos(A) = adjacent/hypotenuse, so cos(60) = y/12.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include trigonometric relationship for solving.
