PROBLEM 2924 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find \cos C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 3 units
- Side BC is marked as 5 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 3 units (given)
- BC = 5 units (given)
- Angle C's cosine is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for cos C
- Cos C = Adjacent / Hypotenuse = AC / BC
- Need to find AC first, using Pythagorean theorem

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for finding AC
