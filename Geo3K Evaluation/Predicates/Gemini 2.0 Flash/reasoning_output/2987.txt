PROBLEM 2987 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center K.
- There are points A, B, and C on the circle or its extension.
- I can see a right triangle KBC with vertices labeled K, B, C.
- Side KB has a length of 2.
- Side KC has a length of 5.
- Side BC is labeled as x.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.
- Line AB is labeled as 2.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle KBC is a right triangle with a right angle at B.
- Sides KB and BC are perpendicular.
- Side KC is the hypotenuse.
- K is the center of the circle.
- KC is the radius of the circle.
- KA is the radius of the circle since A lies on the circle.
- KA = KC = 5.
- KB + BA = KA
- 2 + 2 = 4 = KB + BA, this does not equal the radius length 5, so A does not lie on the circle. Point A exists outside the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- KB = 2 (given)
- KC = 5 (given)
- BC = x (unknown)
- AB = 2 (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BC, which is x.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle KBC.
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides of the right triangle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for solving.
- Need to represent circle with center K.
- KB + BA = KA can be represented.
