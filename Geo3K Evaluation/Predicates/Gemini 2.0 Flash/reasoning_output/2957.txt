PROBLEM 2957 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify two triangles: Triangle ADC and a smaller triangle ADE.
- There's a line segment AE parallel to line segment BC.
- There are two right angles: one at point B and one at point E.
- The length of AD is 10.
- The length of DE is 8.
- The length of DB is 18.
- The length of AC is labeled as x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since AE is parallel to BC, triangles ADE and DBC are similar.
- Angle D is common to both triangles.
- Angle DEA is equal to angle DBC (both are right angles).
- Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DE = 8, AD = 10, DB = 18. This means EB = DB - DE = 18 - 8 = 10 + 8 = 26 - 8 =18
- Also DA/DC = DE/DB = AE/BC
- DC = AD + AC = 10 + x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of AC.
- I need to use the similar triangles property to set up a proportion and solve for x.
- Since the triangles are similar, DE/DB = AD/DC
- Substituting the values: 8/26 = 10/(10+x)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need predicates to represent the points, lines, triangles, right angles, parallel lines, and the measurements.
- I need a predicate to represent the similarity of the triangles.
- I also need predicates to define segment relationships (e.g., DC = DA + AC).
- Finally, a predicate expressing the proportionality of the sides of similar triangles.
