PROBLEM 2912 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 12 = 64. Find the measure of \angle 7.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see two parallel lines Jy and Nz, intersected by two transversals WX and AK.
- There are 16 angles formed at the intersection points, labeled from 1 to 16.
- I am given that m \angle 12 = 64.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Jy and Nz are parallel lines.
- WX and AK are transversals intersecting these parallel lines.
- Angles 12 and 16 are corresponding angles, so they are congruent.
- Angles 7 and 11 are corresponding angles, so they are congruent.
- Angles 12 and 11 are same-side interior angles. Since Jy and Nz are parallel, then angles 12 and 11 are supplementary.
- Angle 7 and angle 12 are supplementary angles.
- Angle 7 and angle 8 are supplementary angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle 12 is given as 64.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 7.
- Angle 12 and angle 11 are supplementary so we can find the measure of angle 11 since angle 12 is given.
- Then since angles 7 and 11 are corresponding, they are equal. Also since angle 7 and angle 12 are supplementary, we can solve the problem.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent parallel lines Jy and Nz.
- Represent transversals WX and AK.
- Represent angles 1 through 16.
- Represent the given measure of angle 12.
- Represent that angle 12 and angle 11 are supplementary angles.
- Represent that angle 7 and angle 11 are corresponding angles.
- Represent that angle 7 and angle 12 are supplementary angles.
