PROBLEM 2424 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle B G E.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center G.
- There are points A, B, C, D, E on the circle.
- There are line segments GA, GB, GC, GD, GE.
- There are line segments AB and DE.
- Angle AGC is labeled as 60 degrees.
- Angle AGD is a right angle, indicated by a square symbol.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- GA, GB, GC, GD, and GE are radii of the circle, so they are congruent.
- Angle AGB is a straight angle since points A, G, and B are collinear.
- AB is a diameter of the circle.
- GD is perpendicular to AB.
- Since AGB is a straight line, the measure of angle AGB is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle AGC = 60 degrees.
- Angle AGD = 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle BGE.
- I need to find a relationship between the known angles (AGC and AGD) and the desired angle BGE.
- Angle AGB = Angle AGC + Angle CGE + Angle EGB. Also Angle AGB = Angle AGD + Angle DGE + Angle EGB

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and points.
- Define the lines.
- Specify the given angle measures.
- State that GA, GB, GC, GD, and GE are radii and are thus congruent.
- Express the fact that AGB is a straight line and therefore a straight angle.
- State the perpendicularity of GD and AB.
