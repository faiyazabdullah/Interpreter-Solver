PROBLEM 2958 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with a point X on AC.
- BX is perpendicular to AC forming two right triangles ABX and CBX
- The length of BX is given as 36
- AX = 6x and CX = x
- AB = z and BC = y
- There are two right angles, one at angle AXB and the other at angle BXC

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABX and triangle CBX are right triangles.
- BX is the altitude of triangle ABC
- Angle AXB and angle BXC are right angles.
- AB and BC are hypotenuses of triangle ABX and triangle CBX respectively
- Triangles ABX and CBX share a common side BX
- The length of AC is the sum of AX and CX.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BX = 36
- Length of AX = 6x
- Length of CX = x
- Length of AB = z
- Length of BC = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find z, which represents the length of AB.
- Need to find the value of x first.
- Use similar triangles ABX and CBX to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, and triangles
- Define right angles
- Specify lengths of given lines
- Represent similarity relationship among triangles
