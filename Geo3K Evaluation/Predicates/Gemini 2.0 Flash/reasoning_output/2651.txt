PROBLEM 2651 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral A B C D is inscribed in \odot Z such that m \angle B Z A = 104, m \widehat C B = 94, and A B \parallel D C. Find m \angle Z A C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center Z.
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in the circle.
- I can see lines connecting the vertices of the quadrilateral and the center of the circle.
- I can see the label E where AC and BD intersect.
- I see that angle BZA is labeled as 104.
- I see that arc CB is labeled as 94.
- I see that AB is parallel to DC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since ABCD is inscribed in the circle, it is a cyclic quadrilateral.
- AB || DC implies that arcs BC and AD are congruent.
- Angle BZA is a central angle.
- Angle BCA is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc as angle BZA.
- Arc CB has a measure of 94 degrees, so the inscribed angle CAB subtending that arc is half that measure.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle BZA = 104
- m \widehat CB = 94
- AB || DC

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m \angle ZAC.
- We need to find relationships between the given information and the desired angle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, quadrilateral, points, lines, and angles.
- Represent the given measurements.
- Represent the parallel relationship between AB and DC.
- Relate the central angle BZA to the arc it subtends.
- Relate the arc CB to the inscribed angle CAB it subtends.
- Indicate that ABCD is inscribed in circle Z.
- State the measure of angle BZA.
- State the measure of arc CB.
- Note that arcs BC and AD are congruent since AB || DC.
