PROBLEM 2941 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, square A B D C is inscribed in \odot K. Find the measure of a central angle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center F.
- There is a square inscribed in the circle, labeled A B D C.
- There is a line segment FG that is perpendicular to line segment CD.
- Points A, B, D, and C lie on the circle.
- The center of the circle is labeled as F.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- A B D C is a square.
- F is the center of the circle that circumscribes the square.
- FG is perpendicular to CD.
- AC and BD are diagonals of the square. Since the square is inscribed in a circle, the intersection of its diagonals is the center of the circle.
- Thus F is the intersection of the diagonals of the square.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- There are no numerical values provided in the image.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of a central angle. A central angle is an angle with vertex at the center of the circle and with sides that are radii. Since F is the center of the circle, examples are Angle(CFD), Angle(DFA), Angle(AFB), Angle(BFC). Since ABCD is a square, the diagonals divide the square into 4 congruent isosceles triangles. This means each of the angles at the center of the circle made by the diagonals has a measure of 90 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent the square inscribed in the circle.
- Represent the perpendicular relationship between FG and CD.
- Represent the points A, B, C, D, F, G.
