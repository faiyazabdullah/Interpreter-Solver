PROBLEM 2689 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a green shape with labeled points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- It appears to be a rectangle with a rectangular hole.
- The rectangle CDEH has sides CD = HE = 5 and CE = DH = 5.
- The rectangular hole ABGF has sides AB = FG = 2 and BG = AF = 2.
- The length of AH and BE are both 5.
- The length of DF and GC are both 5.
- The length of HA is divided into segments HA = 2+2+1
- The length of BE is divided into segments BE = 2+2+1
- The sides of the exterior rectangle are 5 and 5
- The sides of the interior rectangle are 2 and 2

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- CDEH is a rectangle.
- ABGF is a rectangle.
- ABGF is contained inside CDEH.
- AB, BC, CE, EH, HA, AF are lines.
- The overall shape is not a standard polygon.
- All angles in rectangles are right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CD = 5, HE = 5, CE = 5, DH = 5
- AB = 2, FG = 2, BG = 2, AF = 2
- There is an implied length of 1 along AH and BE since AH = AB + BG + GH = AB + FG + GH => 5 = 2 + 2 + GH, so GH = 1
- Similarly, the length of FC and GD = 1

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of the figure.
- The perimeter involves summing up the lengths of all the sides of the external and internal rectangles.
- Perimeter = CD + DE + EH + HC + FG + GB + BA + AF

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points and lines.
- Specify the rectangles.
- Specify the given measurements and their corresponding lines.
- Determine which lines form the perimeter of the overall shape.
