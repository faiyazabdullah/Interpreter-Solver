PROBLEM 2736 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The segment is tangent to the circle. Find the value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center Z.
- There are three points labeled W, X, and Y.
- Line segment WX has a length of 2x+9.
- Line segment XY has a length of 3x+6.
- Line segment WX is tangent to the circle at point W.
- Line segment XY is tangent to the circle at point Y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since WX and XY are tangent to the circle at points W and Y respectively, then segments WX and XY are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of WX is 2x+9
- Length of XY is 3x+6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- To find x, I can set the length of WX equal to the length of XY and solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Create predicates to represent all points, lines, the circle and their lengths.
- Represent the relationship that segment WX and XY are equal to each other.
