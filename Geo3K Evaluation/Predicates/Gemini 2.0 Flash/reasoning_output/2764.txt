PROBLEM 2764 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of the variable y in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines AD and EI.
- I can see a transversal line GH intersecting the parallel lines at points Y and B respectively.
- I can identify angles (3x-15)°, (y+25)°, and 105°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AD and EI are parallel lines.
- GH is a transversal.
- Angle DYH and 105° are corresponding angles.
- Angles DYH and AYG are supplementary, and they are also vertically opposite.
- Angle AYG and (y+25)° are supplementary angles on the same side of the transversal.
- Angles YBE and 105 degrees are supplementary angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle DYH = (3x-15)°
- Angle AYG = (y+25)°
- Angle EBG = 105°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of y.
- I need to use the properties of parallel lines and transversals to find a relationship involving y.
- Since AD || EI, corresponding angles are equal.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and lines.
- State that the lines are parallel.
- Represent the angles.
- State the relationship between the angles using corresponding angles postulate/theorem and supplementary angle relations.
