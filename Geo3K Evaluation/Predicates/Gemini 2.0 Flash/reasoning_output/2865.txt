PROBLEM 2865 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram A B C D to find A D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram labeled ABCD.
- Side BC has a length of 18.
- Side CD has a length of 12.
- Angle DAB is labeled as 115 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
- AB is parallel to CD and AD is parallel to BC.
- AB = CD and AD = BC.
- Opposite angles are equal. Angle DAB = Angle BCD and Angle ADC = Angle ABC
- Consecutive angles are supplementary, i.e. they add up to 180 degrees.
- Thus, Angle DAB + Angle ADC = 180

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 18
- CD = 12
- Angle DAB = 115 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AD.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AD = BC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram.
- Represent the given side lengths and angle measure.
- Establish the relationship between opposite sides of a parallelogram.
