PROBLEM 2970 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle W Y Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points A, B, C, W, X, Y, Z.
- I see lines AB, BC, AC. Also lines WX, WY, WZ.
- Angles: <XWY, <YWZ. Also <XWZ, <Y
- I see right angle symbols at X and Z.
- I see the angle at Y as 23 degrees.
- The lengths WX and WZ are both 4.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles WXY and WZY are right triangles.
- WY is a shared side between the two right triangles.
- The lines WX and WZ are congruent.
- Angle XWY is congruent to angle ZWY because the triangles are congruent (RHS).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of WX = 4
- Length of WZ = 4
- Measure of angle XWY + Measure of angle ZWY = Measure of angle XYZ = 23 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle WYZ.
- This requires understanding that angle XYZ is bisected by WY, and that angle XYW and angle ZYW are equal.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need predicates for the points, lines, triangles, right angles, congruent sides.
- I need to represent the relationship between angles XWY, ZWY and XYZ.
