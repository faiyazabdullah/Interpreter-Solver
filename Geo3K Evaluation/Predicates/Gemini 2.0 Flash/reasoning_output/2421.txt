PROBLEM 2421 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram ABCD.
- Side AB is labeled as 20 cm.
- The angle at vertex B is labeled as 60 degrees.
- The perpendicular distance from vertex D to side BC is labeled as 12 cm.
- There is a right angle symbol at the base of the perpendicular from D to BC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
- The perpendicular distance from D to BC represents the height of the parallelogram with BC as the base.
- Angle B is given as 60 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of side AB = 20 cm
- Height of parallelogram = 12 cm
- Angle B = 60 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram.
- The perimeter of a parallelogram is given by 2 * (length + width).
- We know the length of side AB (20 cm), and because ABCD is a parallelogram, side CD also equals 20 cm.
- The height of the parallelogram (12 cm) is the length of the altitude from D to BC.
- The base BC can be considered the width of the parallelogram, and because ABCD is a parallelogram, side AD also equals BC.
- Therefore, we need to find the length of BC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the parallelogram, the given side length, the angle at B, and the height.
- Represent that the perimeter is twice the sum of the sides.
- Since it's a parallelogram, AB = CD and AD = BC.
