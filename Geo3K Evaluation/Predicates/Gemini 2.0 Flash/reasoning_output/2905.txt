PROBLEM 2905 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y. Round to the nearest tenth, if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center P.
- There are three points A, B, and C on the circle.
- There are two lines MA and MC that are tangent to the circle at points A and C respectively.
- Point B lies on line MC.
- Length of MA is 10.
- Length of BC is 6.
- MB is labeled as y.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- MA and MC are tangent to circle P, therefore MA = MC.
- MC = MB + BC
- We have LengthOf(MA), LengthOf(BC) and need to find LengthOf(MB).
- Tangent segments from the same external point are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(MA) = 10
- LengthOf(BC) = 6
- LengthOf(MB) = y

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of y.
- We need to establish the relationship between MA, MB, and BC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines and circle.
- State the lengths of MA and BC.
- Express MC as the sum of MB and BC.
- State that MA and MC are equal.
