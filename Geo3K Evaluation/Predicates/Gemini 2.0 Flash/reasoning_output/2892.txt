PROBLEM 2892 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: in \triangle X Y Z, P is the centroid, K P = 3, and X J = 8. Find Y J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, and Z.
- There are points J, K, and L on sides XY, YZ, and XZ, respectively.
- Point P is the intersection of lines YL, XK, and ZJ.
- There are line segments XJ, YJ, YK, ZK, ZL, XL, XP, YP, ZP, JP, KP, and LP.
- The length of XJ is labeled as 8.
- It is given that P is the centroid of the triangle XYZ and KP = 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since P is the centroid, YL, XK, and ZJ are medians of the triangle.
- J is the midpoint of XY, K is the midpoint of YZ, and L is the midpoint of XZ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of XJ = 8.
- Length of KP = 3.
- Since medians of a triangle intersect at a point which divides them in the ratio 2:1, XP:PK = 2:1, YP:PL = 2:1, ZP:PJ = 2:1.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of YJ.
- Since J is the midpoint of XY, XJ = YJ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, points, lines, and the fact that P is the centroid.
- Represent the measurement XJ = 8.
- Represent the fact that J is the midpoint of XY.
