PROBLEM 2480 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 6.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see multiple triangles, some right triangles.
- Points are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- Angles are labeled with numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and degree measurements 25°, 51°, 35°, 28°.
- Line segments have length labels 3 and 4.
- There are right angle markings at G, B and F.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ACG is a right triangle.
- Triangle BFC is a right triangle.
- Angles 5 and 6 are adjacent angles.
- Angle 2 and angle ACG are complementary, and their sum is 90 degrees.
- Angle 1 and angle GCB are complementary, and their sum is 90 degrees.
- Angle 3 and angle CAE is 25 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle E = 25°
- Angle CAG = 51°
- Angle BCG = 28°
- Angle DCB = 35°
- Length of AC is 3.
- Length of CD is 4.
- Angle CGB is 90°
- Angle CFB is 90°
- Angle CBF is 90°
- Angle CAB is 51°.
- Angle ACB = 180 - 51 - 25 = 104 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 6.
- To find m<6, we need to determine m<5 because <5 + <6 = 90°.
- Consider triangle BCD. We know DCB = 35°. We need to determine m<D.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all shapes and points
- Define all angle measures
- Define right angles
- Define side lengths
- Establish relationships between angles and sides
