PROBLEM 2930 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use a calculator to find the measure of \angle J to the nearest degree.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle JKL with vertices labeled J, K, L
- Side LK is marked as 9 units
- Side JK is marked as 14 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex L

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is a right triangle with a right angle at L
- Sides JL and LK are perpendicular
- Side JK is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LK = 9 units (given)
- JK = 14 units (given)
- Angle J is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle J
- This requires using trigonometric ratios
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides and angle J
- Since we know the opposite (LK) and hypotenuse (JK), we can use the sine function

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include trigonometric relationship for solving
