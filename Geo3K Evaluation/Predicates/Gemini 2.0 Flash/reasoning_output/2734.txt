PROBLEM 2734 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- I can see a point D on the line extending from point B to point A.
- Angle at vertex B is labeled as B.
- Angle at vertex C is labeled as C.
- Angle at vertex D is labeled as x.
- Sides CB and BD appear equal length, thus triangle CBD may be isosceles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle CBD is isosceles, with CB=BD.
- Angles opposite equal sides are equal, so Angle(C,D,B) = Angle(B,C,D).
- Angle(C,D,A) is an exterior angle of triangle CBD. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)) = MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,D)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D)). Since angles Angle(C,D,B) and Angle(B,C,D) are equal, and Angle(C,D,B) is Angle(C,D,A), then  MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A))= MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,B)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,D))  becomes x = Angle(B,C,D)+ Angle(C,B,D).
- MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)) = x

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The image shows two angles that appear equal, suggesting sides of the triangle may be of equal length.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x, which is MeasureOf(Angle(C,D,A)).
- I need to relate the angles and sides to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines, angles, and the isosceles triangle CBD.
- Represent the exterior angle relationship and the equality of angles.
