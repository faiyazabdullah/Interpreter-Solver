PROBLEM 2695 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \widehat L P.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- There are points L, N, P on the circle.
- There is a line tangent to the circle at point L.
- There is a line that intersects the circle at points N and P.
- There is a point M outside the circle.
- The angle at M is given as 36 degrees.
- The angle at N is given as 78 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The line through M and L is tangent to the circle at L.
- The line through M, N, and P is a secant line to the circle.
- Angle MNL is 36 degrees.
- Angle MNL is an exterior angle to the triangle LNM.
- Angle NLP is an inscribed angle.
- Arc LP is intercepted by inscribed angle NLP.
- We can relate the measure of arc LP to the measure of angle NLP.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle MNL = 36 degrees
- Angle LNM = 78 degrees
- Angle NLP is supplementary to angle LNM, therefore the sum is 180 degrees.
- Angle NLP = 180 - 78 = 102 degrees.
- Therefore the angle between the tangent line ML and the secant MP is 36 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of arc LP.
- Measure of arc LP = 2 * (measure of angle NLP).
- Measure of arc LP is also related to the angle formed outside the circle by the tangent ML and the secant MP.
- Therefore, the measure of arc LP = mLN + 2mM = mLN + 2*36, 180=36+angleMNP
- 2mMNL = mLP - mNL

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the circle, points, lines, and angles.
- We need to represent the tangency and secant relationships.
- We need to represent the given angle measurements.
- We need to relate the angle outside the circle to the intercepted arcs.
