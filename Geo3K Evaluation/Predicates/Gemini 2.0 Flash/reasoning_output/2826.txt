PROBLEM 2826 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 3 if m \angle 1 = 30.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral WXYZ.
- The vertices of the quadrilateral are labeled W, X, Y, and Z.
- There are two diagonals WZ and XY intersecting at point A.
- Angles are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex Y and vertex Z.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle.
- Angles at vertices Y and Z are right angles.
- WX is parallel to YZ.
- WY is parallel to XZ.
- Diagonals WZ and XY are congruent and bisect each other.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 30 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of \angle 3.
- Since WXYZ is a rectangle, all angles at the vertices are right angles.
- The sum of the angles in triangle ZXA is 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle, vertices, angles, parallel lines, right angles, congruent diagonals.
- Represent the given measurement m \angle 1 = 30.
- State that triangle ZXA exists.
- Indicate that the intersection of diagonals WZ and XY is point A.
