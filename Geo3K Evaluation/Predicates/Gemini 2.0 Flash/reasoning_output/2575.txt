PROBLEM 2575 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points Q, R, S, T on the circumference.
- I can see lines QS and RT intersecting at point A.
- I can see lines RS and QT.
- Angle RQT is given as 32 degrees.
- Arc RS is given as (5x+4) degrees.
- Arc QT is given as (6x-2) degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since RSQT is a cyclic quadrilateral, the inscribed angles subtending the same arc are equal.
- Therefore, angle QRT = angle QST.
- Also angle RQT = angle RST = 32.
- Since RS || QT, the arcs RT and QS are equal.
- Arc RT = 180 - Arc QT and Arc QS = 180 - Arc RS.
- So, Arc RT = Arc QS

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle RQT = 32 degrees
- Measure of arc RS = (5x+4) degrees
- Measure of arc QT = (6x-2) degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle S, which is the same as angle RST.
- Angle RST is the inscribed angle corresponding to the intercepted arc RT
- Since RS || QT arcs RT = QS.
- Also, Arc QS = 180 - (5x+4), and Arc RT = 180 - (6x-2)
- 180-(5x+4) = 180-(6x-2)
- 180-5x-4 = 180-6x+2
- -5x-4 = -6x+2
- x = 6
- Arc RS = 5*6+4 = 34
- Angle QST = half of arc QT.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the circle, points, lines, angles, and arcs.
- I need to represent the given measurements.
- I need to represent that RSQT is cyclic quadrilateral and RS || QT
- I need to represent the relationship between inscribed angles and intercepted arcs.
