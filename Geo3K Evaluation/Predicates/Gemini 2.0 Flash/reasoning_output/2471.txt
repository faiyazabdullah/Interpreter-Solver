PROBLEM 2471 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the trapezoid.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trapezoid ABCD.
- The top base (DA) is 22 ft.
- The bottom base (BC) is 37 ft.
- The height of the trapezoid is represented by line AE, which is 23 ft.
- Angle AEB is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- DA and BC are parallel (bases of trapezoid)
- AE is perpendicular to BC (height of trapezoid)
- ABCD is a trapezoid

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(Line(D,A)) = 22 ft
- LengthOf(Line(B,C)) = 37 ft
- LengthOf(Line(A,E)) = 23 ft

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the trapezoid ABCD.
- The formula for the area of a trapezoid is Area = (1/2) * (base1 + base2) * height.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the trapezoid, its bases, the height, and the right angle.
- Represent the given lengths.
- Represent the area formula for a trapezoid.
