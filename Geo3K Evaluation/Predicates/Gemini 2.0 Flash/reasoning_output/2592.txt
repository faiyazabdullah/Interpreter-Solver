PROBLEM 2592 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded region.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- There is a shaded region within the circle, bounded by arc AC and line segment AC.
- The angle of the unshaded sector ABC is not directly given. Instead, the central angle of the major arc (outside the sector ABC) is given as 240 degrees.
- The radius of the circle is given as 6 mm.
- Points A and C lie on the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- BA and BC are radii of the circle.
- The shaded region is a segment of the circle.
- The central angle of the sector associated with the shaded segment (sector ABC) can be calculated.
- Triangle ABC can be constructed. It's an isosceles triangle, since BA=BC (radii of the same circle).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius BA = Radius BC = 6 mm.
- The angle of the major arc is 240 degrees. Therefore, the central angle ABC = 360 - 240 = 120 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We want to find the area of the shaded segment.
- This can be found by subtracting the area of triangle ABC from the area of sector ABC.
- Area of sector = (central angle / 360) * pi * r^2
- Area of triangle: we know two sides and the included angle (120 degrees). Area = 0.5 * a * b * sin(C)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define circle and points.
- Define radius.
- Define angle.
- Calculate the angle of the sector.
- Define sector and triangle.
- Relate triangle sides.
- Area of Sector = (Angle/360) * pi * r^2
- Area of Triangle = 1/2 * a * b * sin(Angle)
- Area of Shaded = Area of Sector - Area of Triangle
