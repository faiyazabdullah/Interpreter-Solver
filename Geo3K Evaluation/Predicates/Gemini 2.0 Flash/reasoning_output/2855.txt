PROBLEM 2855 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ADC.
- Point B lies on Line DC.
- There is a right angle at vertex B, created by segments AB and BC and AB and BD.
- Angle D measures 45 degrees.
- The length of AC is 5.
- The length of AB is labeled y.
- The length of DC is labeled x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle.
- Angle D is 45 degrees, which makes triangle ABD a 45-45-90 triangle.
- AB is perpendicular to DC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 5
- Angle D = 45 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of y, which is the length of AB.
- Because triangle ABD is a 45-45-90 triangle, the length of AB is equal to the length of BD.
- Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC, we have AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2, so y^2 + BC^2 = 25.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all shapes, measurements, and relationships.
