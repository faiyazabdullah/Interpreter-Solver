PROBLEM 2810 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral A B D C is a rectangle. If m \angle 1 = 38, find m \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle ABCD.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point G.
- Angle 1 is formed by the intersection of diagonal AC and side AB.
- Angle 2 is formed by side AB.
- Angle at vertex B is a right angle.
- m \angle 1 is labeled as 38 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rectangle, which means all angles are right angles, opposite sides are parallel and equal, and diagonals are equal and bisect each other.
- Triangle ABG is a triangle.
- Angle ABC is a right angle, meaning m \angle ABC = 90.
- Angle ABC is formed by angles 2 and the angle between line BD and line AB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 38
- m \angle ABC = 90

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m \angle 2.
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle ABC is 90 degrees.
- Angle 1 plus angle 2 equals 90 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle.
- Need to represent the given angle measurement m \angle 1 = 38.
- Need to represent the right angle at vertex B.
- Need to define the relationship between angle 1, angle 2 and the right angle.
