PROBLEM 2401 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 13 units
- Side BC is marked as 13 units
- Side AC is marked as 10 units
- There is a dashed line from B to AC, forming a right angle with AC. Let's call the intersection point D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle since AB = BC
- The dashed line BD is an altitude of the triangle
- Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude from B bisects AC, so AD = DC = 5

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 13 units (given)
- BC = 13 units (given)
- AC = 10 units (given)
- AD = DC = AC/2 = 5 units

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the figure
- Need to find the height of the triangle, which is BD
- Can use the Pythagorean theorem on right triangle ABD to find BD
- Area = (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * AC * BD

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, the point D, the right angle at D
- Represent the lengths of the sides
- Represent that D is the midpoint of AC
- Represent the Pythagorean theorem relationship in triangle ABD
- Represent the area formula for the triangle
