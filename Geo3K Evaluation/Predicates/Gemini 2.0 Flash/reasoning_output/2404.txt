PROBLEM 2404 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle C A M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center M.
- Points A, B, C, and T lie on the circle.
- Line segments AC and AT are chords of the circle.
- Line segments TB and AD are perpendicular to AM.
- Line segments MB and MD are congruent.
- Angle T is given as 28 degrees.
- Points A, B, C, D, M, N, T are labeled.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since MB = MD and TB and AD are perpendicular to AM, then AM bisects angle DAT and angle BMT.
- Angle T intercepts arc AN, and angle CAM intercepts arc BN.
- Since angle T is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of arc AN.
- Since angle CAM is an inscribed angle, its measure is half the measure of arc BN.
- Arc AN and arc BN are equal.
- Triangle ABM and triangle ADM are congruent.
- Angle AMB is equal to angle AMD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle T = 28^{\circ}

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m \angle C A M.
- m \angle T = 28^{\circ}, m \angle T = (1/2)m(arcAN)
- 28 = (1/2)m(arcAN)
- m(arcAN) = 56^{\circ}
- Arc AN = Arc BN
- Arc BN = 56
- Angle CAM = (1/2) arc BN
- Angle CAM = (1/2) * 56
- Angle CAM = 28^{\circ}

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all the points, lines, angles, circle
- Represent the given angle T
- Represent perpendicularity relations
- Represent congruence of line segments MB and MD
- Represent PointLiesOnCircle relations
