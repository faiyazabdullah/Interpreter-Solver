PROBLEM 2951 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD.
- Point A, B, C, and D are labeled on the figure.
- Side AD is marked as 4 units.
- Side AC is marked as 8 units.
- Side BC is marked as 10 units.
- There are right angle symbols at vertex A and C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is composed of two right angles, located at vertex A and C
- Lines AD and AC are perpendicular.
- Lines AC and BC are perpendicular.
- There is a triangle BCD.
- There is a triangle ABD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 4 units (given)
- AC = 8 units (given)
- BC = 10 units (given)
- We need to find the length of BD to calculate the perimeter.
- The angle ACD is a right angle and BCA is a right angle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of the quadrilateral ABCD
- Perimeter means the sum of all the sides of the figure
- Need to find the length of BD
- Apply Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of BD

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, the right angles, measurements, and relationships
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for solving
- The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of AD, DC, CB, and BA.
