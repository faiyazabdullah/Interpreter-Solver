PROBLEM 2913 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see four points labeled A, B, C, and D.
- I can see three line segments: AB, BD, DC, and BC.
- I can see one angle that is marked as a right angle at vertex C.
- The length of line segment AB is 14.
- The length of line segment BC is 10.
- The length of line segment DC is labeled as x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle BCD is a right triangle with right angle at C.
- The segments BC and CD are perpendicular.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 14
- BC = 10
- DC = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem in the two triangles and using the value of BD to relate them.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the points, line segments, right angle, and the lengths of the line segments.
- Need to express that triangle BCD is a right triangle.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem to establish the relationship between sides in the two triangles.
