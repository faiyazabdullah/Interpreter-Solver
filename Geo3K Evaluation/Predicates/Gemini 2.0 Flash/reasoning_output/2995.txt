PROBLEM 2995 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle B C D \cong \triangle W X Y. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles BCD and WXY.
- Triangle BCD has vertices B, C, and D.
- Angle at vertex C is labeled as (20x - 4)°.
- Angle at vertex B is labeled as (24x + 5)°.
- Side BC is labeled as 11.
- Triangle WXY has vertices W, X, and Y.
- Side WX is labeled as (2x + 5).
- Angle at vertex W is labeled as 77°.
- The triangles are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle BCD is congruent to triangle WXY.
- Corresponding angles are equal: Angle C = Angle X, Angle B = Angle W, Angle D = Angle Y.
- Corresponding sides are equal: BC = WX, CD = XY, BD = WY.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of Angle C = (20x - 4) degrees
- Measure of Angle B = (24x + 5) degrees
- Length of side BC = 11
- Length of side WX = (2x + 5)
- Measure of Angle W = 77 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Since triangles are congruent, BC = WX and Angle B = Angle W.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangles.
- Represent the congruent triangles.
- Represent the angles and sides.
- Represent the equality between sides and angles.
