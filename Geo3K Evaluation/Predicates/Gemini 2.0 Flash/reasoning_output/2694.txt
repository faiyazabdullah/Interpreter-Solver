PROBLEM 2694 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram M N P R to find m \angle M N P.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram MNPR with vertices labeled M, N, P, R.
- The diagonals MP and NR intersect at point Q.
- Various lengths are given: MN = 3x - 4, MQ = 4w - 3, NQ = 15.4, RP = 20, PQ = 11.1, PR = 2y + 5, MR = 17.9.
- Angles are given: Angle NMR = 38°, Angle MNR = 33°, Angle MQP = 83°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- MNPR is a parallelogram, which means opposite sides are parallel and congruent: MN || RP, MR || NP, MN = RP, MR = NP.
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other: MQ = QP, NQ = QR.
- Opposite angles in a parallelogram are congruent: Angle NMR = Angle NPR, Angle MNP = Angle MRP.
- Adjacent angles in a parallelogram are supplementary: Angle NMR + Angle MRP = 180°, Angle MNR + Angle NRP = 180°.
- Since MQ = QP, 4w - 3 = 11.1.
- Since NQ = QR, QR = 15.4
- Also RP = MN so 20 = 3x - 4

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Lengths: MN = 3x - 4, MQ = 4w - 3, NQ = 15.4, RP = 20, PQ = 11.1, PR = 2y + 5, MR = 17.9.
- Angles: Angle NMR = 38°, Angle MNR = 33°, Angle MQP = 83°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find m \angle MNP
- In parallelogram MNPR, m \angle MNP + m \angle NMR = 180 degrees.
- We know m \angle NMR = 38 degrees, so m \angle MNP = 180 - 38 = 142 degrees.
- Also, m \angle MNR = 33 degrees

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, given lengths and angles, and the properties of parallelograms (opposite sides parallel and congruent, diagonals bisect each other, opposite angles congruent, adjacent angles supplementary).
