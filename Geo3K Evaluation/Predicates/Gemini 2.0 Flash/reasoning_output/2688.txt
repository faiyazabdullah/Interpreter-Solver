PROBLEM 2688 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of t in the parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral WXYZ with diagonals WY and XZ intersecting at point B.
- The lengths of WB, BY, BX, and BZ are labeled with expressions: 8, 6, s-7, and 2t-6 respectively.
- Point B appears to be the midpoint of both diagonals.
- The quadrilateral appears to be a parallelogram because the diagonals bisect each other.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the diagonals of the quadrilateral bisect each other, WXYZ is a parallelogram.
- Because WXYZ is a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, WB = BY and XB = BZ.
- The given expressions for lengths can be equated based on the bisection property.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WB = 8
- BY = 6
- XB = s-7
- BZ = 2t-6
- Since B is the midpoint, WB = BY and XB = BZ

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of 't'.
- To find 't', we need to use the relationship XB = BZ and substitute the expressions.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define points W, X, Y, Z, B
- Need to define lines connecting these points (sides and diagonals)
- Need to state that B is midpoint of diagonals
- Need to equate the diagonal segments and their lengths.
- Establish the definition of the parallelogram.
