PROBLEM 2590 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find G I if G H = 9, G K = 6, and K J = 4.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle GJI with vertices labeled G, J, I.
- There is a line segment KH inside the triangle.
- Points K and H lie on sides GJ and GI respectively.
- Line segments KH and JI are parallel, indicated by arrow marks.
- The lengths of GH, GK and KJ are given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle GKH is similar to triangle GJI because KH || JI.
- Due to similarity, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal: GH/GI = GK/GJ = KH/JI.
- GJ is composed of GK and KJ, so GJ = GK + KJ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GH = 9
- GK = 6
- KJ = 4
- We are asked to find GI.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We want to find GI.
- We can use the similarity of triangles GKH and GJI to set up a proportion.
- We know GH and want GI, and we know GK and KJ, from which we can calculate GJ = GK + KJ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangle GJI
- Define points K and H on GJ and GI respectively
- Express that KH is parallel to JI
- State the given lengths GH, GK, and KJ
- State that GJ = GK + KJ
- Indicate the similarity between triangle GKH and GJI.
- State the proportionality equation GH/GI = GK/GJ.
