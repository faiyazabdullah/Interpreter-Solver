PROBLEM 2862 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle W.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z
- The angles are labeled as follows:
  - Angle X is labeled as x°
  - Angle Y is labeled as 2x°
  - Angle W is labeled as 3x°
  - Angle Z is labeled as 4x°

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360°.
- Therefore, x + 2x + 3x + 4x = 360.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle X = x°
- Angle Y = 2x°
- Angle W = 3x°
- Angle Z = 4x°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle W.
- This requires calculating the value of x, and then multiplying by 3 to find the measure of angle W.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral and its angles.
- Need to represent the relationship that the sum of interior angles equals 360°.
