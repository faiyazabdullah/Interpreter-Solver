PROBLEM 2432 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle with vertices labeled A, B, E, D.
- Side AE is marked as 9 inches.
- Side BE is marked as 16 inches.
- There are right angle symbols at vertices A, B, E, and D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABED is a rectangle, thus AB is parallel to DE, and AE is parallel to BD.
- Also, opposite sides of rectangle ABED are congruent.
- All angles of rectangle ABED are right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AE = 9 inches (given) which is also the LengthOf(Line(A,E))
- BE = 16 inches (given) which is also the LengthOf(Line(B,E))
- The question asks to calculate the area of rectangle ABED

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of rectangle ABED
- This requires multiplying length times width

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, right angles, measurements, and the formula for the area of a rectangle.
