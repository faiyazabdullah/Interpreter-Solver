PROBLEM 2743 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AC is marked as 11 units
- Side BC is marked as 12 units
- Angle A is marked as 60 degrees
- Angle B is marked as x degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a scalene triangle.
- I can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines to relate the sides and angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 11 units (given)
- BC = 12 units (given)
- Angle A = 60 degrees (given)
- Angle B = x degrees (variable we need to find)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle B (x)
- This requires using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines.
- Law of Cosines: BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2(AB)(AC)cos(A)
- Law of Sines: sin(A)/BC = sin(B)/AC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the given measurements, and relationships.
- Use Law of Sines or Law of Cosines to find x.
