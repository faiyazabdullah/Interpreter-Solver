PROBLEM 2972 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: U J = 9, V J = 3, and Z T = 18. Find S J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a complex geometric figure with points S, Y, Z, J, V, U, T.
- Lines connect these points, forming triangles and other shapes.
- There are congruence markings on several line segments.
- The lengths UJ = 9 and VJ = 3 are given.
- Also given, ZT = 18.
- I can identify the following line segments: SY, YZ, ZS, ST, TU, US, ZV, VU, ZU, YJ, VJ, UJ, SJ, TJ.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The congruence markings indicate the following equalities: SY = YZ = SZ, ST = TU = US, ZV = VU. This implies that triangle SYZ and triangle STU are equilateral triangles, and point V bisects ZU. Because YZ = ZS = SY, Triangle SYZ is equilateral, and because ST = TU = US, Triangle STU is also equilateral. Also, V is the midpoint of ZU.
- Point J is the intersection point of lines YU, SV, and TZ.
- We can observe that YJ is the median of triangle SYZ and TJ is the median of triangle STU, similarly VJ is the median of triangle ZVU.
- The medians of similar triangles are in the same ratio as sides.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- UJ = 9, VJ = 3, ZT = 18.
- Because V is the midpoint of ZU, ZV = VU.
- Using the given information and properties of similar triangles and medians we should find the length of SJ.
- Because J is the centroid of both equilateral triangles.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks us to find the length of SJ.
- We can use the properties of equilateral triangles and their medians to relate SJ to the given lengths.
- We are given that UJ = 9 and VJ = 3.
- In an equilateral triangle, the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio.
- Knowing VJ, we can find JV.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the points, lines, triangles.
- We need to represent the congruence relations between line segments.
- We need to specify the given lengths.
- We need to capture the fact that J is the intersection point.
- We need to represent the equilateral triangles.
- We need to capture the relationship between the medians and centroid of an equilateral triangle.
- V is the midpoint of ZU.
