PROBLEM 2806 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find \angle C of quadrilateral A B C D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Angle A is marked as 3x degrees
- Angle D is marked as x degrees
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD has two right angles at B and C.
- Side AB is perpendicular to side BC.
- Side BC is perpendicular to side CD.
- Side AB is parallel to side CD.
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle A = 3x degrees (given)
- Angle D = x degrees (given)
- Angle B = 90 degrees (right angle)
- Angle C = 90 degrees (right angle)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle C.
- Angle C is explicitly marked as a right angle.
- We can determine that angle C is equal to 90 degrees.
- Use the fact that the sum of angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, angles, right angles, and the relationship between the angles.
- Must include the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
