PROBLEM 2989 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For the pair of similar figures, use the given areas to find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two kite shapes.
- The larger kite is labeled with vertices A, B, C, and D.
- The area of the larger kite is labeled as 400 mm^2.
- One of the sides of the larger kite has a length of 40 mm.
- The smaller kite has an area of 64 mm^2.
- One of the sides of the smaller kite is labeled as x mm.
- The two kites are similar.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two kites are similar polygons.
- The areas of the two kites are given.
- The length of a side on each kite is given (one is unknown).
- The ratio of the areas of similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of corresponding sides.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Area of larger kite = 400 mm^2.
- Length of side of larger kite = 40 mm.
- Area of smaller kite = 64 mm^2.
- Length of side of smaller kite = x mm.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- I need to use the relationship between similar figures areas and sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the kite shapes.
- I need to represent the area and side lengths.
- I need to represent the similarity between the kites.
- I need to establish the ratio relationship.
