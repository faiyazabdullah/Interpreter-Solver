PROBLEM 2660 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 13 units
- Side AC is marked as 22 units
- Side BC is marked as x units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at B
- Sides AB and BC are perpendicular
- Side AC is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 13 units (given)
- AC = 22 units (given)
- BC = x units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BC (x)
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for solving
