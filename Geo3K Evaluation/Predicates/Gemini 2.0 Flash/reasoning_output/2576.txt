PROBLEM 2576 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find X Y of isosceles \triangle X Y Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle XYZ with vertices labeled X, Y, and Z.
- The length of side XY is labeled as 2x+3.
- The length of side YZ is labeled as 4x-1.
- The length of side XZ is labeled as 8x-4.
- Sides XY and YZ have congruent markings (pink lines).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle XYZ is isosceles since sides XY and YZ are congruent.
- Therefore, XY = YZ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XY = 2x + 3
- YZ = 4x - 1
- XZ = 8x - 4
- Since XY = YZ, then 2x + 3 = 4x - 1.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of XY.
- Since XY = 2x + 3, we need to find the value of x first.
- We can use the fact that XY = YZ to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the triangle, the lengths of the sides, and the congruence of sides XY and YZ.
