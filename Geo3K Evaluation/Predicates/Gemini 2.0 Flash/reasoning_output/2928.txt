PROBLEM 2928 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find C F if B F bisects \angle A B C and A C \parallel E D, B A = 6, B C = 7.5, A C = 9, and D E = 9.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- I can see lines AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, BF, and AC.
- I can see triangle ABC.
- I can see parallel lines AC and ED.
- I can see that BF bisects angle ABC.
- I can see a right angle at B.
- The length of BA is 6.
- The length of BC is 7.5.
- The length of AC is 9.
- The length of DE is 9.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at B.
- BF bisects angle ABC. Therefore, angle ABF is equal to angle FBC.
- AC is parallel to ED.
- Because AC is parallel to ED, angle ACB is equal to angle CDE.
- The figure is not drawn to scale and the values appear to be rounded.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BA = 6
- BC = 7.5
- AC = 9
- DE = 9

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the length of CF.
- We can use similar triangles to solve this problem. Since AC is parallel to ED, triangle CBF is similar to triangle DBF.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points and lines.
- Define triangle ABC.
- Define parallel lines AC and ED.
- Define angle bisector BF.
- Define right angle at B.
- Define given lengths.
- State similarity of triangles CBF and DBF.
