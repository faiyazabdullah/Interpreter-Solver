PROBLEM 2786 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find X W.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a triangle WXY.
- Point Z is on the line WY such that XZ is perpendicular to WY.
- XZ is an altitude of triangle WXY.
- WY is bisected by XZ at point Z.
- Side XY has a length of 12.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since XZ is perpendicular to WY, Angle XZY is a right angle and Angle XZW is a right angle.
- Since WY is bisected by XZ, WZ is congruent to ZY.
- Since WZ is congruent to ZY and XZ is perpendicular to WY, triangle WXY is an isosceles triangle with sides WX and XY congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XY = 12
- Since triangle WXY is isosceles with WX and XY congruent, WX = XY = 12.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of XW.
- We know that XY = 12 and that XW = XY because triangle WXY is isosceles.
- Therefore, XW = 12.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, and angles present in the figure.
- Define all relationships that are present based on the markings (congruence, perpendicularity, bisection)
- Define triangle WXY and its properties.
