PROBLEM 2447 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of the variable y in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD.
- Line CE extends from point C.
- Angles are labeled as follows: Angle A = (3y+40)째, Angle D = 120째, Angle B = x째, Angle BCE = (3x-70)째.
- Lines AD and CE have arrows, indicating they are parallel.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AD is parallel to CE. This implies that angle ACB and angle DAC are alternate interior angles and therefore congruent.
- Angle BCE and angle ABC are consecutive interior angles if BC is considered a transversal, which means their sum is 180 degrees.
- The sum of interior angles of quadrilateral ABCD is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle A is (3y+40) degrees.
- Measure of angle D is 120 degrees.
- Measure of angle B is x degrees.
- Measure of angle BCE is (3x-70) degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of the variable y.
- This requires establishing relationships between the angles, using properties of parallel lines and quadrilaterals.
- Need to use the fact that AD is parallel to CE.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the quadrilateral and its vertices.
- Represent the parallel lines AD and CE.
- Represent the angle measurements in terms of x and y.
- Represent the relationship between the angles created by parallel lines (consecutive interior angles).
- Represent the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.
