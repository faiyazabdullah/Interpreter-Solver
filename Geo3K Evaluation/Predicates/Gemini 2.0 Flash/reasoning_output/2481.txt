PROBLEM 2481 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \odot P \cong \odot Q. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two circles, one with center P and another with center Q.
- In circle P, there is a diameter RS with length 3x. The major arc RS has a measure of 155 degrees.
- In circle Q, there is a chord TU. The minor arc TU has a measure of 7x - 44 degrees.
- The major arc TRU has a measure of 205 degrees.
- The two circles are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two circles are congruent, therefore their radii are equal.
- RS is a diameter of circle P, therefore the arc RS has a measure of 180 degrees.
- The sum of the measures of arc TRU and arc TU is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of major arc RS = 155 degrees
- Length of diameter RS = 3x
- Measure of major arc TRU = 205 degrees
- Measure of minor arc TU = 7x - 44 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x, knowing that the two circles are congruent.
- We can establish an equation based on the arcs and their measures.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circles and their congruence.
- Represent the diameter, chords, and arcs.
- Represent the given measurements.
- Represent the relationships between the arc measures.
