PROBLEM 2451 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle R.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle labeled as triangle RQS.
- Side RQ is labeled as 18.
- Side QS is labeled as 23.
- Side RS is labeled as 37.
- The angles are labeled as angle R, angle Q, and angle S.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle RQS is a triangle with three sides with known lengths.
- There are no right angles or parallel lines marked.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RQ = 18
- QS = 23
- RS = 37

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle R.
- I will use the law of cosines:
cos(R) = (QS^2 + RS^2 - RQ^2) / (2 * QS * RS)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent triangle RQS
- Represent lengths of sides RQ, QS, RS
- Use the law of cosines formula to express cos(R)
