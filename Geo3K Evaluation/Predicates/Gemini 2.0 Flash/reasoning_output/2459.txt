PROBLEM 2459 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: J K L M is a rectangle. M L P R is a rhombus. \angle J M K \cong \angle R M P, m \angle J M K = 55, and m \angle M R P = 70. Find m \angle K L P.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle JKLM and a rhombus MLPR.
- Points are labeled J, K, L, M, R, P.
- There are lines connecting these points forming the shapes.
- \angle JMK and \angle RMP are marked as congruent.
- m \angle JMK = 55 degrees and m \angle MRP = 70 degrees are given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a rectangle, so all its angles are right angles and opposite sides are parallel and equal.
- MLPR is a rhombus, so all its sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel and opposite angles are equal.
- \angle JMK \cong \angle RMP is given.
- Since JKLM is a rectangle, angles J, K, L, M are 90 degrees.
- Since MLPR is a rhombus, ML=LP=PR=RM, and angle MLP = angle MRP, and angle LMR = angle LPR.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle JMK = 55 degrees
- m \angle MRP = 70 degrees
- Since \angle JMK \cong \angle RMP, m \angle RMP = 55 degrees.
- All angles of rectangle JKLM are 90 degrees.
- Opposite angles of the rhombus are equal, so m \angle MLP = m \angle MRP = 70 degrees, and m \angle LMR = m \angle LPR = (360-70-70)/2 = 110 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find m \angle KLP.
- We know m \angle KLM = 90 degrees since JKLM is a rectangle.
- We also know m \angle MLP = 70 degrees since MLPR is a rhombus.
- Therefore, m \angle KLP = 360 - 90 - 70.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the shapes: rectangle JKLM, rhombus MLPR.
- Define the congruent angles \angle JMK and \angle RMP.
- Define the measurements: m \angle JMK = 55, m \angle MRP = 70.
- State that all angles in rectangle JKLM are 90 degrees.
- State that opposite angles in rhombus MLPR are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary.
