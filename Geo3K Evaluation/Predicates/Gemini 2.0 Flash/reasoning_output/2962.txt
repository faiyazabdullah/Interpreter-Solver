PROBLEM 2962 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded sector. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center labeled S
- There is a sector defined by points R, S, and T
- The radius of the circle (and therefore, the sector) is labeled as 15 mm
- The angle of the sector RST is labeled as 93 degrees
- The sector is shaded green

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- SR and ST are radii of the circle and therefore are equal in length.
- Sector RST is a portion of the entire circle.
- The area of the sector can be determined based on the angle of the sector and the radius of the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 15 mm
- The angle of the sector RST is 93 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the shaded sector.
- This requires the formula for the area of a sector: Area = (angle/360) * pi * r^2
- Need to establish the angle and radius relationship to calculate the area.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, sector, radius, angle, and measurements.
- Include predicates that capture all the given information and the relationship between these elements.
