PROBLEM 2803 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as x
- Side AC is marked as 24 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C
- Angle ABC is marked as 61 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 24 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 61 degrees (given)
- AB = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of AB.
- We can use trigonometry since we know the angle ABC and the side opposite to it (AC).
- sin(angle) = opposite/hypotenuse
- sin(61) = 24/x

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and trigonometric relationships.
