PROBLEM 2710 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 5 if m \angle 1 = 30.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral WXYZ, which is a rectangle.
- There is a point A where the diagonals WZ and XY intersect.
- There are numbered angles labeled 1 through 12.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertices Y and Z of the rectangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle, therefore opposite sides are parallel and all angles are right angles.
- Diagonals of the rectangle bisect each other.
- Angle 6 is a right angle.
- Angle 3 is a right angle.
- Angle 1 and Angle 4 are congruent since they are alternate interior angles when line XZ intersects parallel lines WX and YZ.
- Angle 5 and Angle 8 are congruent since they are alternate interior angles when line XY intersects parallel lines WX and YZ.
- Angle 2 and Angle 3 are complementary.
- Angle 6 and Angle 7 are complementary.
- Angle 9 and Angle 10 are vertical angles, and thus congruent.
- Angle 11 and Angle 12 are vertical angles, and thus congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle 1 is given as 30 degrees.
- Angle 6 and 3 are 90 degrees.
- The question asks to find the measure of angle 5.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 5.
- Since WXYZ is a rectangle, WX is parallel to YZ. Thus, the angle 5 is congruent to angle 8 since they are alternate interior angles. Also, angles 1 and 4 are congruent since they are alternate interior angles. Therefore, if angle 1 is known then Angle 4 is known and that allows us to find Angle 5.
- In triangle AXZ, Angle 4 + Angle 10 + Angle 3 = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rectangle, angles, parallel lines, congruency, and given measurements.
