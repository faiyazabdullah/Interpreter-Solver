PROBLEM 2959 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the rhombus.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD.
- The quadrilateral ABCD is marked as a rhombus.
- The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E.
- The length of segment DE is given as 11 m.
- The length of segment AE is given as 12 m.
- The diagonals are bisected at the point of intersection E.
- The diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a rhombus.
- AE = EC and DE = EB.
- AC and BD are perpendicular.
- Angle AEB is a right angle.
- Angle BEC is a right angle.
- Angle CED is a right angle.
- Angle DEA is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DE = 11 m.
- AE = 12 m.
- Since E is the midpoint of AC, AC = 2 * AE = 2 * 12 = 24 m.
- Since E is the midpoint of BD, BD = 2 * DE = 2 * 11 = 22 m.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- The area of a rhombus is half the product of its diagonals: Area = (1/2) * AC * BD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the shape as a Rhombus.
- Define the points A, B, C, D, and E.
- Define the lines AC and BD.
- E is the intersection of AC and BD.
- E is the midpoint of AC and BD.
- AC is perpendicular to BD.
- Provide the lengths of AE and DE.
