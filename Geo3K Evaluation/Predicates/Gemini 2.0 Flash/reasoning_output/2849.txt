PROBLEM 2849 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m \angle 4 = 2 y + 32 and m \angle 5 = 3 y - 3. Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two vertical lines with arrowheads.
- These lines are labeled A-C and D-E.
- There is a transversal line labeled F-G intersecting both vertical lines at points H and B respectively.
- There are angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4 at point H and 5, 6, 7, 8 at point B.
- The figure provides angle measurements: m \angle 4 = 2y + 32 and m \angle 5 = 3y - 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines A-C and D-E appear to be parallel.
- F-G is a transversal line intersecting A-C at H and D-E at B.
- Angles 4 and 5 are alternate interior angles.
- If A-C and D-E are parallel, then angles 4 and 5 are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 4 = 2y + 32
- m \angle 5 = 3y - 3

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks us to find the value of y.
- To do this, we need to use the relationship between angles 4 and 5.
- Since the lines are parallel, the alternate interior angles are equal.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define points, lines and angles.
- We need to state the measure of angle 4 and angle 5.
- We need to state that lines AC and DE are parallel.
- We need to express that angle 4 and angle 5 are alternate interior angles.
- We need to express the relationship between angles 4 and 5.
