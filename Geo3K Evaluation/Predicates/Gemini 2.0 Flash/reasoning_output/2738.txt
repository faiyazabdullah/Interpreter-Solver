PROBLEM 2738 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Express the ratio of \tan L as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle JKL with vertices labeled J, K, L.
- Side JK is marked as 5 units.
- Side LK is marked as 12 units.
- Side JL is marked as 13 units.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex K.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is a right triangle with right angle at K.
- Sides JK and LK are perpendicular.
- Side JL is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 5 units (given)
- LK = 12 units (given)
- JL = 13 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of tan L as a decimal rounded to the nearest hundredth.
- tan L = opposite/adjacent = JK/LK

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must define tan L as JK/LK.
