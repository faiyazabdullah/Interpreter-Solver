PROBLEM 2574 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: G J is a diameter of \odot K. Find m \widehat G L J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center K.
- Points G, H, J, and L lie on the circle.
- Line GJ is a straight line passing through the center K.
- Angle HKJ is labeled as 122 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line GJ is a diameter of circle K.
- Since GJ is a diameter, arc GJ is a semicircle.
- The measure of a semicircle is 180 degrees.
- Arc GLJ is composed of arc GL and arc LJ, or arc GJ - arc LJ

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle HKJ = 122 degrees. This is a central angle that subtends arc HJ.
- Since angle HKJ is a central angle, measure of arc HJ equals the measure of angle HKJ, which is 122 degrees.
- Arc GJ = 180 degrees because GJ is a diameter.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc GLJ.
- We know that the measure of arc GJ is 180 degrees since GJ is the diameter
- The measure of major arc GLJ is equal to 360 - minor arc GJ = 360 - minor arc HJ,  where minor arc HJ = arc(HJ) = 122
- Arc GLJ = arc GJ - arc LJ. To find arc GLJ, it could be found by 360 - arc(GLJ) = arc HJ
- Since GJ is a diameter, m(arcGJ) = 180.
- Also m(arcGJ) = m(arcGL)+m(arcLJ)
- We need more information to solve for m(arcGLJ).
- We are trying to find m(arcGLJ). This is m(arcGL) + m(arcLJ) or m(arcGJ) + m(arcJL) where arc(GJ) =180 degrees. Therefore, since GJ is a diameter, arc GLJ =360-arcLJ, arcGL+ arc LJ = 180, Arc HJ= 122.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Need to represent diameter.
- Need to state the relationships between the circle, points, angles, and arcs.
-Need to indicate that the angle 122 is the measure of Arc HJ
