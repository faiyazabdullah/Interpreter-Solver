PROBLEM 2435 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Angle A is labeled as 25 degrees.
- Angle B is labeled as 40 degrees.
- Angle C is labeled as x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure shows a triangle.
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle A is 25 degrees.
- Measure of angle B is 40 degrees.
- Measure of angle C is x degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- This requires using the property that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and its angles.
- Represent the measures of the angles.
- Represent the relationship that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180.
