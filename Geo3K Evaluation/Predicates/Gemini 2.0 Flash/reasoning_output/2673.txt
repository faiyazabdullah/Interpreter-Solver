PROBLEM 2673 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot R, find T V. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle centered at R.
- There are points T, U, V, S, and R on the diagram.
- Line TV is a chord of the circle and appears to pass through the center R.
- Line US is a chord of the circle.
- Line US is perpendicular to line TV at point S.
- The length of US is given as 5.
- The length of SR is given as 6.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- TV is a diameter of the circle since it passes through the center R.
- Since US is perpendicular to the diameter TV, S is the midpoint of US. Thus, US is bisected by TV.
- Therefore, the length of US should be the same on both sides of TV.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- US = 5, SR = 6
- Since TV is a diameter, we can deduce the radius of the circle.
- We want to find the length of TV, which is twice the radius.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of TV.
- We know SR = 6 and need to find the radius, which is TR or VR.
- Since US is perpendicular to TV, triangle URS is a right triangle.
- We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find UR, which is the radius.
- TV = 2 * radius = 2 * UR

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, and their relationships.
- Include the right angle and the lengths of US and SR.
- Apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangle URS.
