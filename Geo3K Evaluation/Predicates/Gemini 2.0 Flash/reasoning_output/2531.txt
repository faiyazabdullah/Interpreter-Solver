PROBLEM 2531 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of the triangle. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Angle C is labeled as 48 degrees.
- Side BC is labeled as 3.5 ft.
- Sides AB and AC have congruent markings.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC.
- Angle B is congruent to angle C because sides AB and AC are congruent.
- Angle A can be calculated since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 3.5 ft (given)
- Angle C = 48 degrees (given)
- Angle B = Angle C = 48 degrees
- Angle A = 180 - (48 + 48) = 84 degrees
- The perimeter of the triangle is AB + BC + AC. Since AB = AC, the perimeter is 2*AB + BC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of the triangle.
- We know BC = 3.5 ft.
- Need to find the length of AB (or AC) to calculate the perimeter.
- Use Law of Sines: AB/sin(C) = BC/sin(A)  =>  AB = BC * sin(C) / sin(A)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, points, angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Include the isosceles triangle property.
- Express the relationships between the angles and the sides.
- Calculate the length of side AB using the Law of Sines.
