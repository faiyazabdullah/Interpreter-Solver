PROBLEM 2789 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot T, Z V = 1, and T W = 13. Find X Y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center T.
- There are points X, Y, Z, V, W on or inside the circle.
- Line segment XY is a chord of the circle.
- Line segment ZV is a part of the radius TZ.
- Line segment TW is a radius of the circle.
- Line segment XY is perpendicular to line segment TV.
- Point V lies on line segment TZ, and also on line segment XY.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- T is the center of the circle.
- TW and TX and TY and TZ are radii of circle T.
- Since XY is perpendicular to TV at V, V is the midpoint of XY. So, XV = VY.
- TV + VZ = TZ
- XY is a chord.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ZV = 1
- TW = 13
- TW = TX = TY = TZ = 13 (radii of the same circle)
- TV = TZ - VZ = 13 - 1 = 12
- Triangle TXV is a right triangle with TX = 13 and TV = 12.
- XV^2 + TV^2 = TX^2 (Pythagorean Theorem)
- XV^2 + 12^2 = 13^2
- XV^2 = 169 - 144 = 25
- XV = 5
- XY = 2 * XV = 2 * 5 = 10

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of XY.
- We need to find XV using the Pythagorean theorem and then double it.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle, points, and line segments.
- State the perpendicularity.
- Define given measurements ZV and TW.
- Indicate that TW, TX, TY, and TZ are radii and equal.
- Indicate V lies on XY and TZ.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem for triangle TXV.
- State that XV = VY.
