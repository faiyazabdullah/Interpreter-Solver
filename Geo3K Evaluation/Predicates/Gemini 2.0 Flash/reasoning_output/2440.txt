PROBLEM 2440 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Polygon A B C D \sim polygon A E F G, m \angle A G F = 108, G F = 14, A D = 12, D G = 4.5, E F = 8, and A B = 26. Find m \angle A D C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify two polygons: A B C D and A E F G.
- I can see the points A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- I can identify the lines A B, B C, C D, A D, A E, E F, F G, A G.
- I can see that m \angle A G F = 108 degrees.
- The following lengths are given: G F = 14, A D = 12, D G = 4.5, E F = 8, and A B = 26.
- It is stated that polygon A B C D \sim polygon A E F G.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Polygons A B C D and A E F G are similar.
- Since the polygons are similar, corresponding angles are congruent, and corresponding sides are proportional.
- Angle A G F corresponds to angle A D C.
- Side A G corresponds to side A D.
- Side G F corresponds to side D C.
- Side A E corresponds to side A B.
- Side E F corresponds to side B C.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Given lengths: G F = 14, A D = 12, D G = 4.5, E F = 8, and A B = 26.
- Angle A G F = 108 degrees.
- Since the polygons are similar, we have the following ratios:
  A G / A D = G F / D C = A E / A B = E F / B C.
- We can also state that m \angle A G F = m \angle A D C.
- A G = A D - D G = 12 - 4.5 = 7.5.
- Thus, A G / A D = 7.5 / 12 = 5 / 8.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m \angle A D C.
- Since polygon A B C D \sim polygon A E F G, then m \angle A D C = m \angle A G F.
- m \angle A G F is given as 108 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the polygons and their similarity.
- Define the angles and sides.
- State the given lengths and angle.
- Define the relation between corresponding angles.
