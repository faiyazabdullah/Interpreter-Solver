PROBLEM 2596 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle JKL with vertices labeled J, K, and L.
- Side JK has a length of 3x + 6.
- Side KL has a length of 4x.
- Side JL has a length of 5x - 6.
- There are single tick marks on each side indicating that all sides are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is an equilateral triangle because all three sides are congruent.
- This means JK = KL = JL.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 3x + 6
- KL = 4x
- JL = 5x - 6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Since the triangle is equilateral, we can set any two sides equal to each other to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the congruence of the sides, and the lengths of the sides.
- Establish equality between sides.
