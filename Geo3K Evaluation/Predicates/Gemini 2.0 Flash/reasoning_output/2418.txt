PROBLEM 2418 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle A D C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- There's a point F inside the quadrilateral.
- Line segments AB, BC, CD, DA, AC, and BD are visible.
- Angle DAB is labeled as 20 degrees.
- Angle ABC has a 32-degree mark at A and a 40.1-degree mark at B, suggesting these are parts of larger angles, and there is an angle ABC with measure 32 + 40.1
- Length of AB is labeled as 6.
- Length of DA is labeled as 9.
- Length of DC is labeled as 6.86.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is labeled as a parallelogram ABCD.
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are parallel and equal in length.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary.
- Diagonals bisect each other.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle DAB is 20 degrees
- Measure of a part of angle BAC is 32 degrees
- Measure of a part of angle ABC is 40.1 degrees
- Length of side AB is 6
- Length of side DA is 9
- Length of side DC is 6.86

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle ADC.
- Since ABCD is a parallelogram, angle ADC = angle ABC.
- Also, angle ADC and angle DAB are supplementary.
- Therefore, angle ADC = 180 - angle DAB = 180 - 20 = 160 degrees.
- Alternatively, we can say that angle ABC = 180 - angle DAB. Angle ABC = angle ADC, so that calculation can be done.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent that ABCD is a parallelogram.
- Need to represent the measures of the angles.
- Need to represent the lengths of the sides.
- Need to represent supplementary angles and opposite angles being equal.
