PROBLEM 2916 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find K L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle JKL with vertices labeled J, K, L
- Side JK is marked as x + 7
- Side KL has a congruent mark with JK
- Side JL is marked as 4x - 8
- Sides JK and KL have a congruent mark, which means they are equal in length
- Side JL has a congruent mark with sides JK and KL, which means they are also equal in length

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is an equilateral triangle since all three sides are congruent
- The length of JK, KL, and JL are equal

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = x + 7
- KL = x + 7
- JL = 4x - 8
- Since the triangle is equilateral, JK = KL = JL. Thus x + 7 = 4x - 8

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of KL
- We have JK = KL = x + 7 and JL = 4x - 8, where JK = JL = KL
- Setting JK equal to JL we can solve for x: x + 7 = 4x - 8.
- Solving for x: 3x = 15, thus x = 5
- Substituting x into the expression for KL: KL = 5 + 7 = 12

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, congruent sides, measurements, and relationships.
