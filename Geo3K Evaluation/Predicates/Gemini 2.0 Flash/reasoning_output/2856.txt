PROBLEM 2856 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The segment is tangent to the circle. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A
- There are points A, B, C, and D labeled in the image
- Line BC is tangent to the circle at point B
- Line DC intersects the circle at point D
- The length of segment BC is labeled as 30
- The length of segment DC is labeled as 18
- The length of segment AB (radius) is labeled as x

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AB is a radius of the circle
- AD is a radius of the circle
- BC is tangent to the circle at B, therefore angle ABC is a right angle
- AC is a secant
- Points A, D, and C are collinear

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 30
- DC = 18
- AB = x
- AD = x (since AD is also a radius)
- AC = AD + DC = x + 18

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of x, the radius of the circle
- Since BC is tangent to the circle at B, triangle ABC is a right triangle
- We can use the Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABC: AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, circle, and triangle
- Specify that BC is tangent to circle A at B
- Specify the lengths of BC and DC
- Specify AB = x
- Specify that AD is a radius
- Define the right angle at B
- Use the Pythagorean theorem for triangle ABC
