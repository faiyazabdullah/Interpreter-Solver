PROBLEM 2929 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If \frac { I J } { X J } = \frac { H J } { Y J }, m \angle W X J = 130 and m \angle W Z G = 20, find m \angle J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points D, W, X, Y, Z, G, H, I, J.
- I can identify lines DW, WX, XY, YZ, ZC, GH, HI, IJ, JH.
- I can identify angles WXJ, WZC.
- I can see that angle WXJ is 130 degrees, and angle WZC is 20 degrees.
- I can identify triangle JHI.
- It is given that IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points D, W, X, Y, and Z lie on a line.
- Points G, H, and I lie on a line.
- HJ intersects XY at H.
- IJ intersects XY at I.
- Lines DW and ZC are parts of the same line.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠WXJ = 130
- m∠WZC = 20
- IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of angle J.
- This requires using the information about angle WXJ, angle WZC, and the ratio IJ/XJ = HJ/YJ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent all points, lines, angles, and given measurements.
- Need to represent the equality of the ratio IJ/XJ and HJ/YJ.
