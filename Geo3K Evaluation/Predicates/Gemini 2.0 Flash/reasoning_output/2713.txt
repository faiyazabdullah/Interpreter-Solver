PROBLEM 2713 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram A B C D to find m \angle C D F.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- I can see a point F inside the quadrilateral
- I can see lines connecting the vertices and point F forming triangles.
- Line AD is labeled with length 29.
- Line CD is labeled with length 25.
- Line BC is labeled with length 3y-4.
- Line AB is labeled with length 5x.
- Angle AFD is labeled with measure 34 degrees.
- Angle DFC is labeled with measure 54 degrees.
- Angle DAF is labeled with measure 49 degrees.
- The quadrilateral is labeled as a parallelogram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
- AD is parallel to BC and AB is parallel to CD.
- AD = BC and AB = CD.
- The diagonals of parallelogram ABCD intersect at point F.
- Opposite angles of a parallelogram are equal.
- Consecutive angles of a parallelogram are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 29
- CD = 25
- BC = 3y-4
- AB = 5x
- Angle AFD = 34 degrees
- Angle DFC = 54 degrees
- Angle DAF = 49 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for measure of angle CDF
- Since it is a parallelogram opposite sides are parallel
- Since AB is parallel to CD, then angle CDF and angle DAF are alternate interior angles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram
- Represent the points and lines
- Represent the given measurements
- Represent the relationships like parallelism and equality of sides
- Represent the angle measurements.
