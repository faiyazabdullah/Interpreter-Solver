PROBLEM 2932 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For trapezoid A B C D, S and T are midpoints of the legs. If C D = 14, S T = 10, and A B = 2 x, find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- S and T are points on the legs AC and BD, respectively.
- ST is a line segment connecting S and T.
- AB and CD are parallel line segments.
- CD = 14
- ST = 10
- AB = 2x
- S and T are midpoints of legs AC and BD.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a trapezoid.
- AB is parallel to CD.
- S is the midpoint of AC.
- T is the midpoint of BD.
- ST is the midsegment of the trapezoid.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of CD is 14.
- Length of ST is 10.
- Length of AB is 2x.
- The midsegment ST is equal to the average of the bases AB and CD.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- I need to use the relationship between the midsegment, and the bases to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the trapezoid, parallel lines, midpoints, and measurements.
- Must include the midsegment formula for the trapezoid.
