PROBLEM 2728 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded region formed by the circle and regular polygon. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center D.
- There is a regular pentagon ABCEFI inscribed in the circle.
- The radius of the circle DI is 10 cm.
- The figure is shaded in the regions between the circle and the pentagon.
- Points A, B, C, E, F, and I lie on the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The pentagon ABCEFI is regular, meaning all its sides and angles are equal.
- The circle is circumscribed about the pentagon.
- The radius of the circle is 10 cm.
- The area of the shaded region is the difference between the area of the circle and the area of the pentagon.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of circle = 10 cm
- We need to find the area of the circle and the area of the pentagon to determine the area of the shaded region.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region.
- We need to find the area of the circle and the area of the pentagon.
- The area of the shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the pentagon.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the geometric shapes and points.
- Specify the radius of the circle.
- Indicate the regular pentagon inscribed in the circle.
- Establish the relationship between the circle and the pentagon (inscribed).
- Define the shaded region as the difference between the areas.
