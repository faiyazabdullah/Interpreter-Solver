PROBLEM 2965 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle WXY with vertices labeled W, X, and Y.
- Side WX is labeled as 9x.
- Side XY is labeled as 4x + 5.
- Side WY is labeled as 6x + 3.
- The sides WX, XY, and WY have a single tick mark indicating they are congruent.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle WXY is an equilateral triangle because all three sides are congruent.
- The lengths of the sides can be related through equations due to the congruence.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WX = 9x
- XY = 4x + 5
- WY = 6x + 3
- Since the triangle is equilateral, WX = XY = WY

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- This requires using the relationships established by the sides being equal.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the sides, and the fact that they are congruent to each other.
- Need to create equations based on the equal sides.
