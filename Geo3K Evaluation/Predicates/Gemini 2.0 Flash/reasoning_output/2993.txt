PROBLEM 2993 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot O, E C and A B are diameters, and \angle B O D \cong \angle D O E \cong \angle E O F \cong \angle F O A. Find m \widehat A C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F lie on the circle.
- Line segments EC and AB are diameters of the circle.
- Angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA are congruent.
- Angle AOC is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since EC and AB are diameters, they pass through the center O.
- Angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA are congruent, implying their measures are equal.
- Angle AOC is a right angle, meaning its measure is 90 degrees.
- The points are arranged around the circle in a specific order.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- We are given that angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA are congruent.
- We are given that angle AOC is a right angle.
- We need to find the measure of arc AC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc AC.
- The measure of arc AC is equal to the measure of central angle AOC.
- Since we know the measure of angle AOC is 90 degrees, the measure of arc AC will also be 90 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, diameters, and congruent angles.
- Represent the right angle AOC.
- Relate the measure of arc AC to the measure of angle AOC.
