PROBLEM 2465 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Lines l, m, and n are perpendicular bisectors of \triangle P Q R and meet at T. If T Q = 2 x, P T = 3 y - 1, and T R = 8, find z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle PQR with vertices labeled P, Q, R.
- There are lines l, m, and n.
- Point T is the intersection of lines l, m, and n.
- There are segments PT, TQ, and TR with lengths labeled as 3y-1, 2x, and 8 respectively.
- Segment PR has a total length labeled z+4.
- Segment DR has a length of 7, where D lies on PR.
- Line l is perpendicular to side QR.
- Line m is perpendicular to side PQ.
- Line n is perpendicular to side PR.
- Point D is the intersection of line l and side PR.
- Point G is the intersection of line n and side PR.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines l, m, and n are perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle PQR, so T is the circumcenter of triangle PQR.
- Since T is the circumcenter, TP = TQ = TR.
- Since line n is a perpendicular bisector of PR, PG = GR.
- Therefore, PR = PD + DR.
- Given that DR = 7, and DG = GR - DR = PR/2 - DR.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- TQ = 2x
- PT = 3y - 1
- TR = 8
- PR = z + 4
- DR = 7
- PG = GR and PR = PG + GR, therefore GR = (z+4)/2.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of z.
- Since TP = TQ = TR, we have TP = TR, so 3y - 1 = 8. From this we can solve for y.
- Also, since n is a perpendicular bisector of PR, G is the midpoint of PR, so PG = GR = (z+4)/2.
- We are given that GD + DR = GR = 7+GD
- Since T is the intersection point of the perpendicular bisectors, and TP=TR, and TP=TQ, then PR must equal z+4. GR = (z+4)/2. Then since DR is 7, GR>7. Since PD=GR, we know GR>0, then PG+GR=z+4. GR=7+GD, where GD is an unknown length.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, and triangles.
- Define perpendicular bisectors.
- State TP = TQ = TR.
- Relate PR with PG and GR.
- State relationship between DR and GR.
- State that T is the circumcenter.
