PROBLEM 2647 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that m \parallel n.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines labeled m and n.
- I can see a transversal intersecting both lines.
- The angle between the transversal and line m is labeled (4x-23)°.
- The angle between the transversal and line n is labeled (2x+17)°.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H are labeled.
- Line AC intersects lines m and n.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines m and n are given as potentially parallel.
- The two angles (4x-23)° and (2x+17)° are corresponding angles with respect to transversal AC and lines m and n.
- For lines m and n to be parallel, the corresponding angles must be congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle (4x-23)°
- Measure of angle (2x+17)°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x such that lines m and n are parallel.
- The corresponding angles must be equal for the lines to be parallel.
- Setting the two angle measures equal to each other and solving for x will give the required value.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the angles, their measurements and the lines m and n.
- The relationship between lines m and n needs to be defined.
- Then define that the angles are equal if the lines are parallel.
