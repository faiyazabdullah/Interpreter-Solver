PROBLEM 2687 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diameters of \odot A, \odot B, and \odot C are 10, 30 and 10 units, respectively. Find A C if A Z \cong C W and C W = 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three circles: Circle A, Circle B, and Circle C.
- There is a line that passes through the centers A, B, and C of the circles, and intersects each circle at two points.
- The intersection points on the line are labeled E, Z, X, Y, W, and D.
- I am given that AZ is congruent to CW, and CW = 2.
- I am given the diameters of the circles. Diameter of Circle A is 10, Diameter of Circle B is 30, Diameter of Circle C is 10.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- A, B, and C are the centers of the circles.
- E, Z, X, Y, W, and D lie on the line.
- Points E, A, Z, X, B, Y, W, C, and D are collinear.
- AZ is congruent to CW
- The length of a diameter is twice the length of the radius.
- The problem asks to find the length of AC.
- AC is the distance between the center of circle A and the center of circle C.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DiameterOf(Circle(A)) = 10, therefore RadiusOf(Circle(A)) = 5
- DiameterOf(Circle(B)) = 30, therefore RadiusOf(Circle(B)) = 15
- DiameterOf(Circle(C)) = 10, therefore RadiusOf(Circle(C)) = 5
- LengthOf(Line(C,W)) = 2, therefore LengthOf(Line(A,Z)) = 2 because AZ is congruent to CW.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for LengthOf(Line(A,C))
- A, B, and C are collinear
- A, Z, X, Y, W, C, E, B, and D are collinear
- LengthOf(Line(A,C)) = LengthOf(Line(A,B)) + LengthOf(Line(B,C))

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the points, lines, circles.
- Need to specify the radii of the circles.
- Need to specify that AZ is congruent to CW and CW = 2.
- Need to specify that the points are collinear.
