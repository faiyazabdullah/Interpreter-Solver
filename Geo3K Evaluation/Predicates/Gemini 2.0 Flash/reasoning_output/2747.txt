PROBLEM 2747 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest hundredth, if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle ABNQ.
- A diagonal line AN divides the rectangle into two triangles ADN and ABN.
- The length of side AB is given as 3 inches.
- Angle ANB is labeled as 62 degrees.
- Angle ABN is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABNQ is a rectangle, implying that angle ABN is a right angle and sides AB and NQ are parallel, and sides AQ and BN are parallel.
- Triangle ABN is a right triangle.
- Angle ANB and NAB are complementary, so angle NAB is 90 - 62 = 28 degrees.
- The sides AQ and BN are equal.
- The sides AB and QN are equal.
- The diagonal AN divides the rectangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = 3 inches
- MeasureOf(Angle(ANB)) = 62 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the rectangle ABNQ.
- Area of a rectangle is length times width.
- We know AB = 3 inches.
- Need to find the length of BN.
- Can use the tangent function to relate angle ANB to the ratio of AB and BN.
- Tan(ANB) = AB/BN
- BN = AB / Tan(ANB)
- Then, Area = AB * BN

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle, triangle, given measurements, and trigonometric relationships.
- Plan predicates to represent the geometric shapes, angle measures, side lengths, and the rectangle area formula.
