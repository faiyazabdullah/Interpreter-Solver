PROBLEM 2804 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side CD is labeled as 21 ft
- A perpendicular dashed line goes from point D to point A. The length of this line is labeled as 8 ft.
- Side AD is labeled as 17 ft.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length: AB = CD and BC = AD
- AB is parallel to CD, BC is parallel to AD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CD = 21 ft
- AD = 17 ft
- Altitude of parallelogram (from D to base AC) = 8 ft

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram.
- Perimeter is the sum of all sides.
- Since it's a parallelogram, the perimeter will be 2 * (CD + AD).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the Parallelogram
- Specify the lengths of sides CD and AD
- Specify that opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length
- Relate this information to find the perimeter
