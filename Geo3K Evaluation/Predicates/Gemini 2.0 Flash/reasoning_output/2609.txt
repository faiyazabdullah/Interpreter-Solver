PROBLEM 2609 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find m \widehat H J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center M.
- There are points F, G, H, J, K, P lying on the circle.
- There are line segments FG and HJ which are chords of the circle.
- Line segment KL intersects FG at L and passes through the center M.
- Line segment MP intersects HJ at N and passes through the center M.
- Angle FLK and angle HNP are right angles.
- The measure of arc HP is 65 degrees.
- The length of FL is 24.
- The length of HJ is 48.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since angle FLK is a right angle, KL is perpendicular to FG. Since KL also passes through the center M, KL bisects FG. Thus, FL = LG.
- Since angle HNP is a right angle, MP is perpendicular to HJ. Since MP also passes through the center M, MP bisects HJ. Thus, HN = NJ.
- M is the center of the circle.
- MF, MG, MH, MJ, MK, MP are radii of the circle, thus they are all equal in length.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FL = 24
- HJ = 48
- m(arc HP) = 65

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of arc HJ.
- We know that HN = NJ, and HJ = 48. Thus, HN = NJ = 48/2 = 24.
- Since MP is perpendicular to HJ, it bisects the arc HJ. Thus, m(arc HJ) = 2 * m(arc HJ/2).
- We know m(arc HP) = 65.
- We need to find m(arc HJ).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and the points.
- Define the lines and segments.
- Define the perpendicularity.
- Define the bisection.
- Define the arc measure.
- Define the given lengths.
