PROBLEM 2496 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with four points A, B, C, and D lying on it.
- There are two chords AC and BD intersecting at point E.
- The length of DE is 4.
- The length of BE is x.
- The length of AE is x.
- The length of CE is 9.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Chords AC and BD intersect inside the circle.
- According to the intersecting chords theorem, the product of the segments of one chord equals the product of the segments of the other chord.
- Therefore, AE * CE = BE * DE

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DE = 4
- BE = x
- AE = x
- CE = 9

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- We can use the intersecting chords theorem: AE * CE = BE * DE
- Substituting the given values: x * 9 = x * 4

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the points, the circle, the chords, the intersection point, and the lengths of the segments.
- We also need to represent the relationship from the intersecting chords theorem.
