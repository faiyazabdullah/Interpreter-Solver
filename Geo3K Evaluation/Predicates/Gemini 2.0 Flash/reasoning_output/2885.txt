PROBLEM 2885 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If pentagons A B C D E and P Q R S T are similar, find S R.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two pentagons: A B C D E and P Q R S T
- The pentagon A B C D E has side lengths: AE = 11, ED = 14, DC = 8.
- The pentagon P Q R S T has side length: TP = 6.
- The problem states the pentagons are similar.
- I am asked to find the length of side SR.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since pentagons A B C D E and P Q R S T are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.
- Corresponding sides are: AE and TP, ED and PQ, DC and QR, CB and RS, BA and ST.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AE = 11
- Length of ED = 14
- Length of DC = 8
- Length of TP = 6
- We need to find the scale factor between the two pentagons.
- We need to use DC and SR to find SR, and know the pentagons are similar. Since we don't know QR, we must use a side with a known value.
- TP corresponds to AE.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Question asks to find the length of side SR.
- Since similar pentagons, we will set up a proportion using corresponding sides AE, TP and DC and SR.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the pentagons.
- State that the pentagons are similar.
- Define the lengths of the sides.
- State the proportionality between corresponding sides.
