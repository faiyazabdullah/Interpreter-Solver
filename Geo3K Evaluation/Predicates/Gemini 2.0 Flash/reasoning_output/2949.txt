PROBLEM 2949 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD.
- ABCD appears to be a trapezoid.
- Side AB is perpendicular to side CA.
- Side BD is parallel to side CA.
- The height of the trapezoid is 10 km.
- The length of side BD is 8 km.
- The length of side CA is 11 km.
- Point H is on line CA and line BH, creating a right angle.
- BH is the height of the trapezoid

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Trapezoid ABCD consists of a rectangle with sides of 10 and 8, and a right triangle attached to it with height 10 and base (11 - 8) = 3
- CA and BD are parallel; AB is perpendicular to CA and BD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BD is 8 km.
- Length of CA is 11 km.
- Length of BH is 10 km.
- CH = CA - AH = 11-8 = 3
- Angle BHA is a right angle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the figure.
- The figure is a trapezoid.
- Area of trapezoid = (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)
- Area of ABCD = (1/2) * BH * (BD + CA)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, angles and shapes.
- Specify the measurements of the sides.
- Define the trapezoid.
- Define the area.
