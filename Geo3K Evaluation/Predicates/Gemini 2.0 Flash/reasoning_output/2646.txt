PROBLEM 2646 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle A to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is marked as 27 units
- Side BC is marked as 18 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 27 units (given)
- BC = 18 units (given)
- Angle A is what the question is asking for

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle A
- This requires using trigonometric ratios
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides and the angle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include trigonometric relationship for solving
