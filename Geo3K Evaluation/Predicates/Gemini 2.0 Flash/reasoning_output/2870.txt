PROBLEM 2870 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: Triangle ADE and Triangle BCE
- I can identify points A, B, C, D, and E
- I can see angles labeled as 95 degrees, 109 degrees, 33 degrees, and 24 degrees
- There are also angles marked as 1, 2, and 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angles ADE and BCE are given.
- Angles DAE and ABE are given.
- Angle AEB and angle DEC are vertical angles, and are thus equal.
- The sum of angles in triangle ADE equals 180.
- The sum of angles in triangle BCE equals 180.
- Angle 1 is equal to angle AEB, which are vertical angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ADE = 95 degrees
- Angle DAE = 33 degrees
- Angle BCE = 109 degrees
- Angle ABE = 24 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 2 (DAE).
- I will use the fact that sum of angles in Triangle ADE is 180 to calculate the measure of Angle AED.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent all points, lines, triangles, and angles
- Need to represent the degree measures of the given angles
- Need to represent the relationship between angle AEB and angle 1.
- Need to represent that sum of angles in each triangle is 180.
