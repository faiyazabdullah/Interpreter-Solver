PROBLEM 2487 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Circles G, J, and K all intersect at L. If G H = 10, find F H.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify three circles: Circle G, Circle J, and Circle K.
- These circles intersect at point L.
- I can also identify points B, F, H, D, C, I on the circles.
- I can see lines GB, GF, GH, JI, JL, KD, KC, KL.
- The length of GH is given as 10.
- G, J, and K appear to be centers of their respective circles.
- Points B, G, L, and H are collinear.
- Points F, G, L lie on a line.
- Points D, J, L, I lie on a line.
- Points C, K, and L lie on a line.
- It appears Circle J is inscribed in Circle G, and Circle K is inscribed in Circle J.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- G, J, and K are centers of circles.
- GH is the radius of Circle G. Similarly for JL and KL.
- Since circle J is inside circle G, J lies on the radius GL of circle G. Similarly, K lies on radius JL.
- L is the intersection point of all three circles.
- Since circles intersect at L, the distance from center to L gives radius length.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of GH is 10. GH is a radius of Circle G. Thus, GL = 10.
- The problem asks to find the length of FH. Since FGL and BGL are straight lines, the points are collinear.
- Also, BG and GF are radii of circle G. Since GH = 10, then BG = GF = 10.
- Thus, FH = FG + GH = 10 + 10 = 20.
- It appears that the circles are tangent at L.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find FH.
- Need to use the fact that GH is given, and FH = FG + GH. Since F and H are points on the circle G, then FG and GH are radii, and thus equal in length.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent points, circles, lines.
- Represent the given length.
- Represent the geometric relationship between the points and lines and circles.
- Include the lengths of the radii.
