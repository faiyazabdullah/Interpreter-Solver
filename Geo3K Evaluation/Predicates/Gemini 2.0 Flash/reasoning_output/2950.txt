PROBLEM 2950 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Point D is the center of the circle. What is m \angle A B C?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center D.
- Points A, B, C, F, and J lie on the circle.
- Line segments AB, BC, CF, and JA are chords of the circle.
- Points H, L, G, E, M, N, and K are also labeled in the figure.
- Line segments EF, LG, DH, DK, DN, AF, and JF are present.
- Quadrilaterals ABCD and AFJD are present.
- Angle ABC, Angle ABC, Angle AFJ, Angle FJD are present.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- D is the center of the circle, so DA, DB, DC, DF, and DJ are radii of the circle, therefore congruent.
- Since DA = DB, triangle ABD is isosceles.
- Angle ADB is a central angle subtended by arc AB.
- Angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AC.
- Angle ADC is a central angle subtended by arc AC.
- Since JA, AF, FJ, JD are chords of the circle and D is the center, Quadrilateral AFJD is cyclic.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical measurements are explicitly given in the figure.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m∠ABC.
- Since D is the center of the circle, and points A, B, and C lie on the circle, ∠ABC is an inscribed angle.
- Also, DA = DB = DC, suggesting radii, central angles and inscribed angles should be considered.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, angles, shapes and their relationships.
- Represent the circle and its center.
- Represent that A, B, C, F, and J lie on the circle.
- Represent the relationships between the radii, central angles, and inscribed angles.
- Capture the properties arising from the center of the circle being D.
