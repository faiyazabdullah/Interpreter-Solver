PROBLEM 2903 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Express the ratio of \sin N as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle with vertices labeled M, N, and P.
- Side NP has a length of 15.
- Side PM has a length of 36.
- Side MN has a length of 39.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex P.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle MNP is a right triangle with a right angle at P.
- Sides NP and PM are perpendicular.
- Side MN is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- NP = 15
- PM = 36
- MN = 39

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of sin N.
- sin N = opposite/hypotenuse = PM/MN

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, right angle, the sides, and their lengths.
- Calculate sin N using the lengths of the sides opposite to angle N and the hypotenuse.
