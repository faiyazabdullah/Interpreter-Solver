PROBLEM 2434 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Let G H be the median of R S B A. Find G H.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral QTRS with interior line segment AB.
- The figure consists of points Q, R, A, B, S, and T.
- Lines QR, AB, and ST are parallel.
- Line segments RA and SB are congruent.
- Line segments AQ and BT are congruent.
- Length of RS is 54.
- Length of QT is 86.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- QTRS appears to be a trapezoid, with RS and QT as parallel bases.
- Given RA congruent to AQ, and SB congruent to BT, it means A is the midpoint of RQ and B is the midpoint of ST.
- AB is thus the midsegment/median of the trapezoid.
- Since AB is a midsegment, its length is the average of the lengths of the two bases.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of RS is given as 54.
- Length of QT is given as 86.
- I need to find the length of AB.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of G H, which is the median of the given trapezoid.
- The median of a trapezoid is a line segment connecting the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. In this case, A and B are the midpoints. Thus G H is equivalent to the length of AB.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the points and lines, the given lengths, and the relationships between them.
- I need to state that A is the midpoint of RQ, and B is the midpoint of ST.
- I need to express the calculation of the length of AB (G H) as the average of the lengths of RS and QT.
