PROBLEM 2982 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m \angle 4 = 42. Find m \angle 7.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify two lines, a and b, and a transversal intersecting both lines.
- The intersection points of the transversal with lines a and b are labeled as D and E respectively.
- There are 8 angles formed by the intersection of the lines, labeled 1 through 8.
- The lines a and b are marked with arrows, indicating they could be parallel.
- The measure of angle 4 is given as 42 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angles 4 and 6 are alternate interior angles.
- If lines a and b are parallel, then alternate interior angles are congruent.
- Angles 6 and 7 are supplementary angles, meaning their sum is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle 4 is 42 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of angle 7.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 7.
- This requires using the properties of parallel lines and supplementary angles.
- We need to establish the relationship between angles 4, 6, and 7.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the lines, transversal, angles, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include parallel relationship and supplementary angle relationship.
