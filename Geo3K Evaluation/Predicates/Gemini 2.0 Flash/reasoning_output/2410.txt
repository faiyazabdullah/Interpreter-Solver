PROBLEM 2410 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find C D if A C = x - 3, B E = 20, A B = 16, and C D = x + 5.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure composed of two triangles and a quadrilateral.
- The points are labeled A, B, C, D, E.
- The lines are AB, AC, BC, DE, CD, BE.
- There are arrows along lines BC and DE, suggesting that these lines may be parallel or related by a translation.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure suggests that quadrilateral BCDE may be a parallelogram.
- The arrows along BC and DE indicate they are parallel.
- If BCDE is a parallelogram, then BC = DE and CD = BE.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = x - 3
- BE = 20
- AB = 16
- CD = x + 5

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of CD.
- If BCDE is a parallelogram, then CD = BE.
- Therefore, x + 5 = 20, and we can solve for x.
- Then, we can plug x into the equation for AC if needed.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and lines
- State given lengths
- State the potential parallel relationship between BC and DE.
- Assert that CD = BE
