PROBLEM 2567 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral E F G H is a rectangle. If m \angle H G E = 13, find m \angle F G E.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral EFGH.
- The vertices E, F, G, and H are labeled.
- The quadrilateral EFGH appears to be a rectangle.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex H.
- The diagonals EG and FH intersect at point K.
- Angle HGE is labeled as having a measure of 13.
- We are asked to find the measure of angle FGE.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- EFGH is a rectangle, meaning all angles are right angles.
- Angle FHG and EHG and HEF and EFG are right angles.
- EG and FH are diagonals of the rectangle, and intersect at point K.
- Since EFGH is a rectangle, angle FGH is a right angle, and thus measures 90 degrees.
- Angle HGE is given as 13 degrees.
- Angle FGE is adjacent to angle HGE and the sum of their measures is angle FGH, which is 90 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measure of angle HGE is given as 13 degrees.
- The measure of angle FGH is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle FGE.
- We know that the measure of angle FGH is 90 degrees.
- We also know that the measure of angle HGE is 13 degrees.
- The measure of angle FGE can be found by subtracting the measure of angle HGE from the measure of angle FGH.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define quadrilateral EFGH as a rectangle.
- Define the points E, F, G, and H.
- Define the lines EG and FH.
- Indicate that the diagonals intersect at point K.
- State that angle FGH is a right angle.
- State that the measure of angle HGE is 13 degrees.
