PROBLEM 2532 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- There are four points B, C, D, and E on the circumference of the circle.
- There are lines connecting A to B, C, D, and E.
- There are angles at the center A: angle DAB is 85 degrees, angle DAC is 150 degrees, and angle BAE is a right angle (90 degrees). Angle CAE is labeled as x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The angles around point A must add up to 360 degrees.
- Angle BAE is a right angle, so it measures 90 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle DAB = 85 degrees.
- Angle DAC = 150 degrees.
- Angle BAE = 90 degrees.
- Angle CAE = x degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We need to use the fact that the sum of angles around point A is 360 degrees.
- We can set up an equation to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points and lines.
- Define all angles with their measures.
- State that the sum of the angles is 360 degrees.
