PROBLEM 2961 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find J L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle JKL with vertices labeled J, K, L.
- Side JK is labeled as 7x.
- Side KL is labeled as 11x - 8.
- Side JL is labeled as x + 12.
- Sides JK, KL, and JL are congruent, indicated by the tick marks.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle JKL is an equilateral triangle because all three sides are congruent.
- Therefore, the lengths of the sides are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 7x
- KL = 11x - 8
- JL = x + 12

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of JL.
- Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal, and we can use this information to solve for x, and then find the length of JL.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangle and its vertices.
- Define the lengths of each side.
- State the congruency of the sides.
- State the equality of the lengths of the sides.
