PROBLEM 2720 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use rectangle L M N P, parallelogram L K M J to solve the problem. If L N = 10, L J = 2 x + 1, and P J = 3 x - 1, find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a rectangle LMNP
- I can see a parallelogram LKMJ
- The vertices are labeled L, M, N, P, J, K
- There are lines LN, LJ, PJ

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- LMNP is a rectangle, so angle LNP is a right angle
- LKMJ is a parallelogram, so LJ is a diagonal
- LN is a diagonal of the rectangle LMNP. Diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other.
- PJ is a segment of the diagonal PN of the rectangle LMNP.
- J is the intersection point of the diagonals LN and MP in rectangle LMNP.
- Therefore J bisects LN and MP. LJ = JN and PJ = JP. LN = LJ + JN = PJ+PN.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LN = 10
- LJ = 2x + 1
- PJ = 3x - 1

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x
- Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, LJ = JN, and PJ = JN
- Also diagonals of a rectangle are congruent, so LN = MP, and since J bisects LN and MP, LJ = JN = PJ = JP.
- LN = LJ + JN, and LN = 10, LJ = 2x+1, therefore JN = 10 - (2x+1)
- Since diagonals are equal and bisect each other, LJ = PJ, so 2x+1 = 3x-1

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the rectangle and parallelogram
- Represent the lengths LN, LJ, and PJ
- Represent the fact that J is the midpoint of LN
- Represent the relationship LJ = PJ because diagonals of a rectangle are congruent and bisect each other.
