PROBLEM 2702 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \triangle P Q R, Z Q = 3 a - 11, Z P = a + 5, P Y = 2 c - 1, Y R = 4 c - 11, m \angle P R Z = 4 b - 17, m \angle Z R Q = 3 b - 4, m \angle Q Y R = 7 b + 6, and m \angle P X R = 2 a + 10. If R Z is an angle bisector, find m \angle P R Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle PQR.
- There are points Z, Y, and X on the sides PQ, PR, and QR, respectively.
- I can see line segment RZ.
- I can see measurements: ZQ = 3a - 11, ZP = a + 5, PY = 2c - 1, YR = 4c - 11, m∠PRZ = 4b - 17, m∠ZRQ = 3b - 4, m∠QYR = 7b + 6, and m∠PXR = 2a + 10.
- It is given that RZ is an angle bisector.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Point Z lies on the line segment PQ.
- Point Y lies on the line segment PR.
- Point X lies on the line segment QR.
- Line segment RZ bisects angle PRQ.
- Angle PRZ is congruent to angle ZRQ.
- The sum of angles PRZ and ZRQ equals angle PRQ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ZQ = 3a - 11
- ZP = a + 5
- PY = 2c - 1
- YR = 4c - 11
- m∠PRZ = 4b - 17
- m∠ZRQ = 3b - 4
- m∠QYR = 7b + 6
- m∠PXR = 2a + 10
- Because RZ bisects angle PRQ, m∠PRZ = m∠ZRQ.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for m∠PRZ.
- We need to determine the value of b to find the measure of the angle.
- RZ bisects angle PRQ, so m∠PRZ = m∠ZRQ. Therefore, 4b - 17 = 3b - 4.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, points, and angle bisector.
- Represent the measurements given.
- Represent the equality of the angles formed by the bisector.
