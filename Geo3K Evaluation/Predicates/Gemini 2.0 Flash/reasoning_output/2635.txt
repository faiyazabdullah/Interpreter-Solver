PROBLEM 2635 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find T X if E X = 24 and D E = 7.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center D.
- There are points A, E, T, Q, D and X.
- Lines XA and XE are tangent to the circle at A and E respectively.
- Line XT intersects the circle at Q and T.
- DE and DA are radii of the circle.
- Angle DAX and DEX are right angles.
- I am given that EX = 24 and DE = 7.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since XA and XE are tangents to the circle from the same point X, XA = XE.
- DA and DE are radii of the circle and therefore DA = DE.
- DAX and DEX are right triangles.
- Line XD bisects the angle AXE.
- The figure is symmetric about the line XD.
- I need to find TX.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- EX = 24
- DE = 7
- I need to find TX.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find the length of TX given the length of EX and DE.
- I can use the power of a point theorem.
- EX is the tangent to the circle, so EX^2 = XQ * XT.
- Since D is the center of the circle, DQ = DT = DE = DA = 7.
- XQ = XD - DQ = XD - 7
- XT = XD + DT = XD + 7
- Also, in right triangle DEX, XD^2 = EX^2 + DE^2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle, points, lines, and tangency.
- Define the right angles.
- Define the given lengths EX and DE.
- Define the relationship between the lengths based on power of a point theorem.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle DEX to relate XD, EX, and DE.
