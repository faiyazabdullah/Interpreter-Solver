PROBLEM 2555 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle J K L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram JKLM with vertices labeled J, K, L, M.
- The point where the diagonals intersect is labeled R.
- Side JK is labeled as 2b+3.
- Side KL is labeled as 21.
- Side LM is labeled as 45.
- Side MJ is labeled as 3a.
- Angle MLK is labeled as 30 degrees.
- Angle KLJ is labeled as 70 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel and equal in length.
- Opposite angles are equal.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary.
- The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- JK = 2b + 3
- KL = 21
- LM = 45
- MJ = 3a
- Angle MLK = 30 degrees
- Angle KLJ = 70 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle JKL.
- In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Therefore, Angle JKL + Angle KLM = 180 degrees.
- Angle KLM = Angle MLK + Angle KLJ = 30 + 70 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the parallelogram.
- Define the angles.
- Define the lengths of the sides.
- Indicate that opposite sides are equal.
- Indicate that consecutive angles are supplementary.
