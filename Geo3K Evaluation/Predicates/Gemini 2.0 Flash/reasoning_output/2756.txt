PROBLEM 2756 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of \triangle W Z X, if \triangle W Z X \sim \triangle S R T, S T = 6, W X = 5, and the perimeter of \triangle S R T = 15.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, \triangle WZX and \triangle SRT.
- The vertices of \triangle WZX are labeled W, Z, and X.
- The vertices of \triangle SRT are labeled S, R, and T.
- Side WX of \triangle WZX has a length of 5.
- Side ST of \triangle SRT has a length of 6.
- The perimeter of \triangle SRT is 15.
- The two triangles \triangle WZX and \triangle SRT are stated to be similar.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \triangle WZX is similar to \triangle SRT.
- This means their corresponding sides are proportional.
- The perimeter of similar triangles are also proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of WX = 5
- Length of ST = 6
- Perimeter of \triangle SRT = 15
- I need to find the perimeter of \triangle WZX.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of \triangle WZX.
- I have the perimeter of \triangle SRT and the length of corresponding sides WX and ST.
- I can use the proportionality of perimeters of similar triangles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangles and their vertices.
- State the known lengths WX and ST.
- State the perimeter of \triangle SRT.
- State the similarity of the triangles.
- State that the ratio of the perimeters equals the ratio of corresponding sides.
