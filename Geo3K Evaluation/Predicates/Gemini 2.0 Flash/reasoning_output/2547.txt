PROBLEM 2547 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a triangle QRS.
- Inside the triangle is a circle with center W.
- The circle is tangent to the sides of the triangle at points U, V, and T.
- I see the following lengths: QU = 14 in, RV = 27 in, ST = 17 in, QT = 2x in.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the circle is tangent to the sides of the triangle, we know that QU = QT, RV = RU, and ST = SV.
- This is based on the two tangent theorem: If two tangent segments are drawn to a circle from the same external point, then those segments are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- QU = 14, RV = 27, ST = 17, QT = 2x.
- We need to use the properties of tangents to find x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Since QU = QT, we have 14 = 2x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We will state the shapes, points, tangent lines, measurements, and equality based on tangents.
