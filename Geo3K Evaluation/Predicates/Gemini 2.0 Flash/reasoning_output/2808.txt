PROBLEM 2808 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that B E and A D are perpendicular.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see intersecting lines A D and B E, creating four angles at their intersection point F.
- I can also see a line segment C F.
- There are annotations for angle measures: (12y - 10)°, 6x°, and 3x°.
- Points are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, I, J, L, M, N, H

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines I J and M D form line A D.
- Lines L E and N B form line B E.
- A D and B E are perpendicular, which means the angle between them is 90 degrees.
- Angles B F C and C F D are adjacent angles.
- Angles A F I and A F B are supplementary angles.
- Angles A F B and D F E are vertical angles and congruent.
- Angles A F B and D F E each are the sum of 6x and 3x

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle A F B is given as (12y - 10)°.
- Angle B F C is given as 6x°.
- Angle C F D is given as 3x°.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x so that B E and A D are perpendicular
- This means the angle between lines A D and B E must be 90 degrees. Therefore, angles A F B and B F D must sum to 180

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the points, lines, and angles.
- I also need to represent the angle measurements provided in the image and the relationships between those angles.
- Represent that A D and B E are perpendicular.
- Represent the sum of angles B F C and C F D equals to B F D
