PROBLEM 2640 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Assume that any segment that appears to be tangent is tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with some points labeled: A, B, C, E, D, F.
- There is a triangle AED outside of the circle.
- Line AC is secant to the circle.
- Line BE is tangent to the circle at point E.
- The following angles are labeled: Angle C = (4x + 50)°, Angle D = 3x°, Angle AEB = 30°.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle AEB is an exterior angle to triangle AED
- The measure of exterior angle AEB is equal to the sum of the two remote interior angles, Angle D and Angle C.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle C is (4x + 50)°
- Measure of angle D is 3x°
- Measure of angle AEB is 30°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- Need to use the exterior angle theorem.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangle AED.
- Define the circle.
- Identify secant line AC to the circle.
- Identify tangent line BE to the circle.
- Identify point E on the circle.
- State the measure of each relevant angle.
- Relate the measure of angles C, D, and AEB using the exterior angle theorem.
