PROBLEM 2809 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The ratio of the measure of the angles of the triangle below is 3 : 2 : 1. Which of the following is not an angle measure of the triangle?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a triangle ABC with vertices A, B, and C.
- The angles at A, B, and C are denoted as angle A, angle B, and angle C.
- Angle B is marked as a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- The problem states the ratio of the angles is 3:2:1.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The ratio of the angles A, B, C is 3:2:1

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks what is NOT an angle measure of the triangle, given the angle ratio.
- The angles need to be determined using the ratio and the properties of a triangle (sum of angles = 180 degrees).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the triangle, the angles, the ratio of the angles, and the right angle.
