PROBLEM 2523 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The pair of polygons is similar. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two rectangles, ABCD and EFGD.
- The vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- Side AE is marked as 5 units.
- Side AB is marked as x units.
- Side AD is marked as x units.
- Side AG is the sum of AD and DG which equals x + 7.5
- Side EB is marked as x-2 units.
- Side FG is marked as AE plus EB which equals 5 + (x - 2).
- The rectangles ABCD and EFGD are similar.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD and EFGD are rectangles, thus all angles are right angles.
- Opposite sides of rectangles are parallel and equal in length.
- Since ABCD and EFGD are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AE = 5
- AB = x
- AD = x
- DG = 7.5
- EB = x-2
- AG = AD + DG = x + 7.5
- FG = AE + EB = 5 + (x - 2) = x + 3

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x, given that the two rectangles are similar.
- We need to set up a proportion using corresponding sides of the rectangles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the shapes and points.
- Represent the lengths of the sides.
- State that the rectangles are similar.
- Represent the proportional relationship of the sides.
