PROBLEM 2438 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find W R.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, Triangle(W,S,R) and Triangle(T,V,R).
- The vertices are labeled as W, S, R, T, V.
- The sides are labeled with their lengths: WS = 8, WR = x+6, TR = 2x+6, VT = 10
- Angle W and Angle T are marked as congruent.
- Point R is the intersection point of the lines WT and SV.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two triangles share a vertex R.
- Angle W is congruent to Angle T.
- Angle WRS and Angle TRV are vertical angles, and therefore are congruent.
- Since two angles are congruent in the triangles, the third angles are congruent as well.
- Thus, Triangle(W,S,R) is similar to Triangle(T,V,R).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WS = 8
- WR = x+6
- TR = 2x+6
- VT = 10
- Due to the similarity, the sides are in proportion: WS/VT = WR/TR

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of WR, which is x+6.
- I need to find the value of x by setting up the similarity proportion.
- 8/10 = (x+6)/(2x+6)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangles and the points.
- Define the line segments and their lengths.
- Define the angles and congruence of angles.
- Define the similarity of triangles.
- Write the proportion based on the similarity.
