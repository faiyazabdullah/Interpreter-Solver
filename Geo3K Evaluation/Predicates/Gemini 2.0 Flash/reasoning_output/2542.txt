PROBLEM 2542 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the scale factor from Q to Q'.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two squares, one large and one small, and some dotted lines.
- Points are labeled as A, B, C, D, Q, Q', and X.
- Lengths are given as 5 and 15.
- The distance between C and Q is 5, and the distance between C and Q' is 15.
- The distance between Q' and Q is labeled as x.
- There are dashed lines connecting corresponding points.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two squares are similar.
- The smaller square is a scaled version of the larger square.
- Point C is the center of the scaling transformation.
- Q and Q' are corresponding points on the squares.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The distance CQ = 5.
- The distance CQ' = 15.
- The distance Q'Q = x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the scale factor from Q to Q'.
- The scale factor is the ratio of corresponding lengths.
- CQ and CQ' are corresponding lengths.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and shapes.
- Define the lengths CQ and CQ'.
- Define the relationship between CQ and CQ' using RatioOf.
