PROBLEM 2851 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Angle C is marked as 52 degrees
- Angle B is marked as 35 degrees
- Angle A is labeled as x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.
- There are no parallel lines or other special relationships identified other than that ABC is a triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle C = 52 degrees (given)
- Angle B = 35 degrees (given)
- Angle A = x degrees (unknown)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the measure of angle A.
- This requires using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- Need to establish the relationship between the angles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle and the measurements of the angles.
- Must include the angle sum property for solving
