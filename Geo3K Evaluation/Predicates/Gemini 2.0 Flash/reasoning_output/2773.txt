PROBLEM 2773 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: P is the incenter of \triangle A E C. Find m \angle D E P.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify triangle AEC with vertices A, E, and C.
- Point P is inside the triangle AEC
- Segments AP, EP, and CP are visible
- Point B lies on AC, point F lies on AE, and point D lies on EC
- Segments PB, PF, and PD are perpendicular to AC, AE, and EC respectively
- Angle FAC is 33 degrees and angle DCA is 28.5 degrees
- The length of AF is 13 and the length of AE is 14.9 and the length of AB is 10.9
- There are right angles at F, B, and D.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- P is the incenter of triangle AEC. This means that P is the intersection point of the angle bisectors of the triangle AEC.
- PF, PB, and PD are perpendicular to the sides AE, AC, and EC respectively, and since P is the incenter, PF=PB=PD.
- AP, EP, and CP are angle bisectors of angle EAC, AEC, and ECA, respectively.
- Angles FAP and PAC are congruent. Angles DEP and PEC are congruent. Angles DCP and PCA are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle FAC = 33 degrees
- Angle DCA = 28.5 degrees
- Length of AF = 13
- Length of AE = 14.9
- Length of AB = 10.9

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of angle DEP.
- Since AP, EP, and CP are angle bisectors, angles FAP and PAC are equal, as are angles DEP and PEC, and DCP and PCA.
- We can find the angle EAC, which is 33*2 = 66. Angle ECA is 28.5 * 2 = 57
- The sum of angles in triangle AEC is 180 degrees
- Angle AEC = 180 - 66 - 57 = 57
- Angle DEP = 57/2 = 28.5

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent all points, lines, angles and triangles
- Need to represent the given angle measurements and segment lengths
- Need to represent perpendicularity
- Need to represent the incenter property
- Need to represent the angle bisector property
