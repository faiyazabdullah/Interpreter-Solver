PROBLEM 2771 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Solve for x in the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid with vertices labeled A, B, C, D, and E
- Sides CD and AE are parallel.
- A line segment FB is drawn parallel to CD and AE
- The length of CD is 6x+4
- The length of FB is 5x+10
- The length of AE is 10x-2
- Leg AF is congruent to leg BE

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since FB is parallel to CD and AE, and AF is congruent to BE, this implies it is an isosceles trapezoid.
- The segment FB is the median of the trapezoid.
- In an isosceles trapezoid, the median length is the average of the two parallel bases' length.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of CD = 6x+4
- Length of FB = 5x+10
- Length of AE = 10x-2

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to solve for x.
- In a trapezoid, the midsegment is the average of the two parallel sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the trapezoid.
- State the parallel sides.
- Mention the midsegment.
- Write the equation for the length of the median in terms of the two bases.
