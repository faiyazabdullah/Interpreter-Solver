PROBLEM 2799 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Chords A C and D F are equidistant from the center. If the radius of \odot G is 26, find A C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center G.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F lie on the circle.
- Lines AC and DF are chords of the circle.
- There are dashed lines from G to AC and DF, intersecting at points (let's call them X and Y respectively)
- G is the center of the circle.
- The radius of the circle is 26.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Chords AC and DF are equidistant from the center G. This means the perpendicular distance from G to AC is equal to the perpendicular distance from G to DF.
- Let GX be perpendicular to AC and GY be perpendicular to DF. Then GX = GY.
- The radius of the circle is 26.
- If chords are equidistant from the center of a circle, then the chords are congruent. Therefore, AC = DF.
- A line from the center of the circle perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord. Therefore, GX bisects AC and GY bisects DF.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The radius of circle G is 26.
- AC and DF are equidistant from the center G.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks us to find the length of AC.
- Since AC and DF are equidistant from the center, they are equal in length (AC = DF).
- The radius is 26.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and its center.
- Define the points on the circle.
- Define the chords.
- State that the chords are equidistant from the center.
- State the radius of the circle.
- State that the chords are congruent since they are equidistant from the center.
