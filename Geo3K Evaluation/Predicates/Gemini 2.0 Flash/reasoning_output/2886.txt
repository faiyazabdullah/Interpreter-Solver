PROBLEM 2886 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle.
- Points A, B, C, and D are labeled on the circle.
- Angle A is given as 58 degrees.
- Angle B is given as (3y + 4) degrees.
- Angle D is given as (2y + 16) degrees.
- Angle C is given as 2x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral (inscribed in a circle).
- Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary (add up to 180 degrees).
- Therefore, Angle A + Angle C = 180 degrees and Angle B + Angle D = 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle A = 58 degrees
- m \angle B = (3y + 4) degrees
- m \angle C = 2x degrees
- m \angle D = (2y + 16) degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find m \angle D, which is given as (2y + 16) degrees.
- I need to find the value of y first.
- Since Angle B + Angle D = 180, (3y + 4) + (2y + 16) = 180.
- Solve for y. Then, substitute the value of y into (2y + 16) to find m \angle D.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the quadrilateral and the circle.
- State that the quadrilateral is inscribed in the circle.
- Specify the measures of the angles.
- State that opposite angles are supplementary.
