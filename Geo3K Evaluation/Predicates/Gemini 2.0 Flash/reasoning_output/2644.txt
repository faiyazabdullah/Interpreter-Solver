PROBLEM 2644 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D.
- There is a point E where diagonals AC and BD intersect.
- AE is perpendicular to DE.
- Length of DE is 5 and length of BE is 12.
- AD is congruent to AB.
- BC is congruent to CD.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral ABCD is a kite because two pairs of adjacent sides are congruent (AD is congruent to AB and BC is congruent to CD).
- Triangle AED is a right triangle with right angle at E.
- Triangle BEC is not necessarily a right triangle.
- AE and ED are perpendicular.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DE = 5
- BE = 12

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of BC.
- I know that BC is congruent to CD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines, angles, shapes, congruences, and perpendicularity.
