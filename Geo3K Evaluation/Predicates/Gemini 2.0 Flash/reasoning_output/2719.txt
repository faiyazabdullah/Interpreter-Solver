PROBLEM 2719 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Refer to the figure at the right. Find the value of m \angle F C E if p \parallel q.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines p and q
- I can see a transversal line intersecting the parallel lines at points A, B, C, D, E, and F
- I can see angles labeled (3x-60)°, y°, and (2x+15)°

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line p is parallel to Line q
- Angle (3x-60)° and Angle (2x+15)° are corresponding angles

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of Angle (3x-60)° is labeled as (3x-60)°
- Measure of Angle y° is labeled as y°
- Measure of Angle (2x+15)° is labeled as (2x+15)°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of m \angle F C E if p \parallel q.
- Since p is parallel to q, corresponding angles are congruent and their measures are equal. Thus, we can set up an equation: (3x-60) = (2x+15) and solve for x. Then we can find the measure of Angle FCE.
- Also, Angle FCE and Angle BCE form a straight line and are supplementary, therefore, Angle FCE + Angle BCE = 180 degrees. Angle BCE is also y°.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallel lines.
- Represent the angles and their measures.
- Represent the transversal.
- Represent that (3x-60)° and (2x+15)° are equal and that their sum is 180.
- Represent that angle y and angle (3x-60) are supplementary and form a straight line.
