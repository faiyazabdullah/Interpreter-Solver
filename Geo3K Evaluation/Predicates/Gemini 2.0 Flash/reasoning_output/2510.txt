PROBLEM 2510 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Circle J has a radius of 10 units, \odot K has a radius of 8 units, and B C = 5.4 units. Find J K.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two circles, one with center J and one with center K.
- There is a line that intersects both circles. The points of intersection are A, B, C, and D.
- The point B lies on both circles.
- The point C lies on both circles.
- Point J lies on the line segment AB.
- Point K lies on the line segment CD.
- Circle J has a radius of 10 units.
- Circle K has a radius of 8 units.
- BC = 5.4 units.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- A, B, C, and D are collinear.
- J is the center of the circle on the left, thus JB is a radius of circle J.
- K is the center of the circle on the right, thus KC is a radius of circle K.
- The line segment AB is a part of the circle J.
- The line segment CD is a part of the circle K.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Radius of circle J = 10.
- Radius of circle K = 8.
- BC = 5.4.
- The points J, B, C, and K are collinear.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking for the length of JK.
- We have the length of BC.
- Since JB is a radius of circle J, JB = 10.
- Since KC is a radius of circle K, KC = 8.
- Therefore, JK = JB + BC + CK.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circles, points, and lines.
- Define the radii of the circles.
- Define the length of BC.
- The predicates must be able to compute the distance of JK.
