PROBLEM 2979 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the regular polygon. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a regular hexagon labeled A, C, F, H, G, E.
- There is a point B inside the hexagon.
- There is a line segment BD perpendicular to AC.
- The length of AD is given as 3m.
- ABC appears to be an equilateral triangle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The hexagon is regular, so all sides are equal in length and all interior angles are equal.
- AC is a side of an equilateral triangle.
- Since AD = 3, AC = 2 * AD = 6, making each side of the hexagon 6.
- BD is an altitude of the equilateral triangle ABC.
- The area of the regular hexagon can be calculated as 6 times the area of an equilateral triangle with side length 6.
- Or, it can be calculated as 6 times the area of the triangle AB with side length 6. The triangle ABD is a right triangle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 3 m
- AC = 2 * AD = 6m, so each side of the hexagon is 6m.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the regular hexagon.
- I need to find the area of the hexagon using the information provided.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the hexagon, equilateral triangle, the length of the side, and the perpendicular line.
- Need to specify the formula for calculating the area of a regular hexagon, using the side length.
