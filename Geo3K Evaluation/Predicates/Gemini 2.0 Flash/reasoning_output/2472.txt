PROBLEM 2472 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Triangle L M N is equilateral, and M P bisects L N. Find the measure of the side of \triangle L M N.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle LMN with vertices labeled L, M, N
- There is a point P on line LN.
- Line MP is drawn from point M to point P, which bisects LN.
- Side LM is labeled as 3x+1.
- Side MN is labeled as 4x-2.
- Angle LPM is labeled as 5y degrees.
- Triangle LMN is marked as equilateral.
- MP bisects LN

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle LMN is equilateral, implying all its sides are equal in length.
- MP bisects LN, implying LP = PN.
- Since triangle LMN is equilateral, all its angles are 60 degrees.
- MP bisects angle LMN
- Since MP bisects LN and Triangle LMN is equilateral, then angle LPM is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LM = 3x + 1
- MN = 4x - 2
- Angle LPM = 5y degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of the side of triangle LMN.
- Since LMN is equilateral, we can set the expressions for LM and MN equal to each other to solve for x.
- Then, we can plug x back into either expression to get the side length.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent triangle LMN and the point P.
- Represent the equilateral property of the triangle.
- Represent the side lengths LM and MN.
- Represent that MP bisects LN.
- Represent the equality of the side lengths implied by the equilateral triangle.
- Represent the relationship between the angle LPM.
