PROBLEM 2602 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, and C.
- Angle BAC is a right angle.
- Angle ABC is labeled as x degrees.
- Angle ACB is labeled as 2x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.
- The sum of the two non-right angles in a right triangle is 90 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle ABC = x degrees
- Measure of angle ACB = 2x degrees
- Measure of angle BAC = 90 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We can use the property that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the right angle, and the angles in terms of x.
- Need to represent the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
