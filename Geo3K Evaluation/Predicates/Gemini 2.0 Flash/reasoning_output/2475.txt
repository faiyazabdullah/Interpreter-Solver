PROBLEM 2475 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If m \angle 5 = 7 x - 5 and m \angle 4 = 2 x + 23, find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two lines, l and m, with arrowheads indicating a direction.
- A transversal line p intersects both lines l and m.
- The intersection of line l and line p is labeled with angles 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The intersection of line m and line p is labeled with angles 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- The lines l and m are parallel.
- Angle 4 is given as 2x + 23.
- Angle 5 is given as 7x - 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines l and m are parallel.
- Line p is a transversal.
- Angle 4 and Angle 5 are consecutive interior angles formed by the transversal p intersecting the parallel lines l and m.
- Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 4 = 2x + 23
- m \angle 5 = 7x - 5
- m \angle 4 + m \angle 5 = 180

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We can set up an equation using the fact that angles 4 and 5 are supplementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the lines l, m, and p.
- Represent the angles 4 and 5.
- Represent the fact that l and m are parallel.
- State that angle 4 and angle 5 are consecutive interior angles.
- State that the sum of angle 4 and angle 5 is 180 degrees.
- State the given measures of angle 4 and angle 5 in terms of x.
