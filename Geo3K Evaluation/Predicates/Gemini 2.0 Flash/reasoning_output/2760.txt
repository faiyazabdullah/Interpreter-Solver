PROBLEM 2760 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Circle A has diameters D F and P G. If D F = 10, find D A.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- Points D, L, P, G, and F lie on the circle.
- Line segments DF and PG are diameters of the circle.
- DF = 10.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since DF is a diameter, DA and AF are radii and are equal in length.
- Similarly, PA and AG are radii.
- All radii of the circle are equal.
- The length of the diameter is twice the length of the radius.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of diameter DF = 10.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of DA, which is a radius.
- Since DF is a diameter, DA = DF/2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the circle, the points on the circle, the diameters, and the given measurement.
- I need to express that DA is a radius and DF is a diameter.
- Also I need to indicate that DA is half of DF.
