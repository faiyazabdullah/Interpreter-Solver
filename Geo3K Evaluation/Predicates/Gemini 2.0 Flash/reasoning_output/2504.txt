PROBLEM 2504 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as x units.
- Side BC is marked as 15 units.
- The angle at vertex B is 70 degrees.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at C.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 15 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 70 degrees (given)
- AB = x, and is the variable we need to find.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AB (x).
- This requires using trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent).
- Since we have the opposite side (BC) and we want to find the hypotenuse (AB), we will use the sine function.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Must include trigonometric relationships for solving.
