PROBLEM 2682 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, D
- Side BD is labeled as 20 cm
- A dashed line DE is drawn from vertex D perpendicular to line BC
- Side BC is labeled as 12 cm
- Angle ABC is labeled as 60 degrees
- Angle DEC is a right angle

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- ABCD is a parallelogram
- DE is perpendicular to BC
- DE is the height of the parallelogram with base BC
- Angle ABC is an acute angle

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of side BD = 20 cm
- Length of side BC = 12 cm
- Measure of angle ABC = 60 degrees
- Angle DEC = 90 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram
- Area of parallelogram = base * height
- Base is BC = 12 cm
- Need to find the height DE
- We can find DE using trigonometry in triangle BDE. Sine of angle B = DE/BD

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, perpendicularity, measurements, angle
- Use trigonometric relationships to define the height of the parallelogram.
- Define AreaOf parallelogram in terms of its base and height.
