PROBLEM 2443 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points P, Q, R, and S.
- There are lines PQ, QR, RP, QS, and PS.
- I can identify angles at P, Q, R, and S, and some angles have measurements or are marked as right angles.
- Angle Q is a right angle.
- m \angle R = 33^\circ.
- m \angle PQS = 51^\circ.
- There is an angle labeled "1" at S.
- There is an angle labeled "2" at Q.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle PQR is a triangle.
- Angle PQR is a right angle.
- Lines PQ and QR are perpendicular.
- Point S lies on line PR.
- Point S lies on line QS.
- Angles 1 and PSQ are the same angle.
- Angles 2 and RQS are the same angle.
- Triangle PQS and RQS are triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurement of angle R is 33 degrees.
- The measurement of angle PQS is 51 degrees.
- The measurement of angle PQR is 90 degrees.
- Angles PQS and SQR make up angle PQR.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measurement of angle 1.
- Angle 1 is the same as angle PSQ.
- I need to find a relationship between known angles and angle PSQ.
- In triangle PQS, angle PQS is given, and angle QPS can be determined.
- In triangle PQR, angles PQR and PRQ are given, so angle QPR can be found.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the points, lines, triangles and angles.
- I need to define the measurements of the given angles.
- I need to define the right angle.
- I need to define angle addition.
- I need to define the angle sum property of a triangle.
