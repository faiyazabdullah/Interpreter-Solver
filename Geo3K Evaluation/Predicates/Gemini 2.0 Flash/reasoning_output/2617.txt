PROBLEM 2617 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \triangle D E F, m \angle E = 108, m \angle F = 26, and f = 20. Find d to the nearest whole number.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle DEF with vertices labeled D, E, F
- Side DE is labeled f, side EF is labeled d, and side DF is labeled e
- Angle E is labeled with a measure of 108 degrees
- Angle F is labeled with a measure of 26 degrees
- Side f (DE) is labeled with a length of 20

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle DEF is a triangle.
- Side DE is opposite angle F
- Side EF is opposite angle D
- Side DF is opposite angle E

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠E = 108 degrees
- m∠F = 26 degrees
- f = Length of side DE = 20
- The question is asking for the length of side d, which is the length of EF.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of side d (EF).
- We have the length of side f (DE) and the measures of angle E and angle F.
- We can find the measure of angle D using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees: m∠D = 180 - m∠E - m∠F
- We can then use the Law of Sines to find the length of side d: d / sin(D) = f / sin(F)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, points, lines, angles, and measurements
- Need to represent that the angles are the vertices
- Need to use sum angles of the triangle = 180
- Must use law of sines relationship for solving
