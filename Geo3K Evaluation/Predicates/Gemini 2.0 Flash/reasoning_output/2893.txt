PROBLEM 2893 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Express the ratio of \cos P as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle PQR with vertices labeled P, Q, R.
- The length of line PR is 8.
- The length of line QR is 15.
- The length of line PQ is 17.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex R.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle PQR is a right triangle with a right angle at R.
- Sides PR and QR are perpendicular.
- Side PQ is the hypotenuse.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- PR = 8 units (given)
- QR = 15 units (given)
- PQ = 17 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the ratio of cos P expressed as a decimal.
- In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the adjacent side divided by the hypotenuse.
- cos P = PR/PQ

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the right angle, the lengths of the sides, and the cosine relationship.
