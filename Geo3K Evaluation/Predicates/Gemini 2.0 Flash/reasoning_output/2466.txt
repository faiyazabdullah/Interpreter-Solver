PROBLEM 2466 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If A B = 12, A C = 16, and E D = 5, find A E.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, ABC and ABE.
- Line segment BE is parallel to CD, indicated by the arrows.
- Points A, E, and D are collinear.
- Points B and C are on the lines AB and AC respectively.
- The following measurements are given: AB = 12, AC = 16, ED = 5.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABE is similar to triangle ADC because BE is parallel to CD.
- The corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.
- AE + ED = AD
- AB/AD = AE/AC = BE/CD

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 12
- AC = 16
- ED = 5
- The question asks to find AE.
- We can express AD as AE + ED. Therefore, AD = AE + 5.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find the length of AE.
- Use the property of similar triangles to set up a proportion involving AE.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, and triangles.
- State the given lengths.
- State that the lines BE and CD are parallel.
- State that the triangles ABE and ADC are similar.
- State the proportional relationship of corresponding sides.
- Express AD in terms of AE and ED.
