PROBLEM 2784 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- Points C, E, and D lie on the circle.
- Line CD is tangent to the circle at point D.
- Line CE intersects the circle at point E.
- Line CA is a secant to the circle.
- The length of CA is 9.
- The length of CE is 6.
- The length of CD is x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line CD is tangent to circle A.
- Line CA is a secant.
- The tangent-secant theorem applies here: (CD)^2 = CE * CA

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CA = 9
- CE = 6
- CD = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of the tangent segment CD.
- The tangent-secant theorem is required.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle, points, lines, and the given lengths.
- Represent the tangent and secant relationships.
- Represent the tangent-secant theorem.
