PROBLEM 2800 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram labeled A, B, C, and N.
- A perpendicular line from point N to line LA forms a right angle at point L.
- The length of line segment NL is given as 36 inches.
- The length of line segment LA is given as 27 inches.
- The length of line segment AB is given as 40 inches.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a parallelogram, meaning opposite sides are parallel.
- NL is the height of the parallelogram with respect to base AB.
- Angle NLA is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(NL) = 36 inches
- LengthOf(LA) = 27 inches
- LengthOf(AB) = 40 inches

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the parallelogram.
- The area of a parallelogram is base times height.
- Base = AB = 40 inches
- Height = NL = 36 inches

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the parallelogram and its points.
- Define the height and the base.
- State the measured lengths.
- State that NLA is a right angle.
