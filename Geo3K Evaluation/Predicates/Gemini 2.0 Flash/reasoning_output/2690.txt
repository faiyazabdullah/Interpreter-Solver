PROBLEM 2690 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with a line segment DE inside.
- Points A, B, C, D, and E are labeled.
- Line segment DE is parallel to AC.
- AD and DB have congruent markings.
- AD is labeled as 3x + 11.
- DB is labeled as 5x - 8.
- CE is labeled as 4y - 7.
- EB is labeled as 2y - 1.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since DE is parallel to AC, triangle ABC is similar to triangle DBE.
- AD is congruent to DB, which means AD = DB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 3x + 11
- DB = 5x - 8

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of x.
- We know that AD = DB, so we need to set up an equation and solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points, lines, triangle
- Define parallel lines
- Define equal length segments
- Define equality between lengths.
