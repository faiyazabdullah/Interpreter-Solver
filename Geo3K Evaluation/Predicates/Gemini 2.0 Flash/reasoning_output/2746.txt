PROBLEM 2746 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AB is labeled as 2x + 5
- Side BC is labeled as 3x - 4
- Side AC is labeled as 27
- Side AB and BC have single tick mark implying they are of equal length.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Sides AB and BC are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2x + 5
- BC = 3x - 4
- AC = 27

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AB
- Need to establish the value of x, by using the fact that AB=BC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, measurements, and relationships
- Must express the relation AB=BC so that x can be found
- Once x is known, AB = 2x+5 can be evaluated.
