PROBLEM 2674 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot F, m \angle D F A = 50 and C F \perp F B. Find m \widehat A C E.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center F.
- Points A, B, C, D, and E lie on the circle.
- Lines AB and CF are diameters of the circle.
- Angle DFA is labeled as 50 degrees.
- Line CF is perpendicular to line FB.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- F is the center of the circle.
- AB and CF are diameters, so they pass through the center F.
- CF is perpendicular to FB, therefore angle CFB is a right angle.
- The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of its central angle.
- The sum of angles around point F is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle DFA is 50 degrees.
- CF is perpendicular to FB, so angle CFB is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of arc ACE.
- The measure of arc ACE is equal to the sum of the measures of arcs AC and CE.
- The measure of arc AC is equal to the measure of angle AFC.
- Angle AFC and angle DFA are supplementary angles with diameter AD.
- The measure of arc CE is equal to the measure of central angle CFE.
- Angle CFE is supplementary to angle CFB, which means it will be 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the circle and its points.
- Represent the lines, angles, and their measurements.
- Represent the perpendicular relationship.
