PROBLEM 2722 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Each pair of polygons is similar. Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles.
- The first triangle has vertices labeled A, B, and C. The sides are labeled 12, 2x, and 20. The angles at A, B, and C are marked.
- The second triangle has sides labeled y+4, 12, and 15. The angles are marked in the same way as the first triangle.
- The angles are congruent in both triangles, thus similar triangles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The two triangles are similar because their corresponding angles are congruent.
- The sides are proportional, so the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The sides of the first triangle are 12, 2x, and 20.
- The sides of the second triangle are y+4, 12, and 15.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of y.
- Since the triangles are similar, we can set up proportions of corresponding sides.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I will define Triangle(A,B,C).
- I will define the lengths of sides as LengthOf(Line(A,B)).
- I will define Similarity as Similar(Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(D,E,F)).
- I will set up the proportional relationship based on the similarity to find the value of y.
