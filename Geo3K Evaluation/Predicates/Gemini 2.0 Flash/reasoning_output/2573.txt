PROBLEM 2573 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 1 in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.
- I can see lines connecting points forming angles.
- Angle ABC is marked as 90 degrees.
- Angle formed at point A is marked as 157 degrees.
- Angle at point C is labeled as angle 1.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines BC and BA form a right angle at point B.
- Lines GA and AD form an angle of 157 degrees at point A.
- Lines EC and CH intersect at C, forming Angle 1.
- Lines FC and CE intersect at C forming Angle 1.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC = 90 degrees
- Angle formed at point A = 157 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 1.
- We need to find the measure of angle 1 using the given information.
- We can use the fact that vertically opposite angles are equal.
- Angle 1 is vertically opposite to the angle formed by lines EC and CF at point C.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent all points, lines, and angles.
- We need to represent the given measurements of angle ABC and the angle at point A.
- We need to represent the relationship of vertical angles at point C.
