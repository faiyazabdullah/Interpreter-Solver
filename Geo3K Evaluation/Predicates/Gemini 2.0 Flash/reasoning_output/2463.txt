PROBLEM 2463 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is labeled as x.
- Side AC is labeled as z.
- Side BC is composed of segments BD labeled 8 and DC labeled 12.
- There is a point D on the line BC.
- There is a line segment AD labeled y.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.
- There is a right angle between AD and BC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A.
- Line AD is perpendicular to Line BC.
- Point D lies on line BC.
- Triangles ABD and CAD are right triangles.
- Triangles ABC, DBA and DAC are similar.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of BD = 8
- Length of DC = 12
- Length of BC = BD + DC = 8 + 12 = 20

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AD which is labeled as y.
- Since triangles ABC, DBA, and DAC are similar, we can use the proportional sides of similar triangles to find the length AD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Need to define point D lying on BC.
- Need to define segment lengths BD, DC and BC.
- Need to represent perpendicular relationship.
- Need to represent similar triangles.
