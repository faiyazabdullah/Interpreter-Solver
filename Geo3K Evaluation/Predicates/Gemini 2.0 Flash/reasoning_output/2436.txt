PROBLEM 2436 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle 2 if m \widehat B C = 30 and m \widehat A D = 20.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points A, B, C, and D on the circle.
- I can see arcs BC and AD.
- I see lines AD and BC intersecting at point F inside the circle.
- I see angles 1 and 2 formed at the intersection F.
- I see m \widehat B C = 30 and m \widehat A D = 20.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on the circle.
- The measure of angle 2 is related to the measures of arcs BC and AD.
- Angle 2 is an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle.
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are vertical angles, therefore they are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \widehat B C = 30 degrees
- m \widehat A D = 20 degrees
- We are looking for m \angle 2.
- The measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the intercepted arcs.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find the measure of angle 2.
- Relevant geometric properties: The measure of an angle formed by intersecting chords inside a circle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points and lines.
- Define the circle.
- Define the arcs.
- Define the angles.
- Represent the relationship between the angle and the intercepted arcs.
