PROBLEM 2581 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- The length of side AB is 2x+3.
- The length of side BC is x+7.
- The length of side CD is 3y-5.
- The length of side DA is y+11.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The problem asks us to find the value of 'x' that would make ABCD a parallelogram.
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length.
- Therefore, AB = CD and BC = DA.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 2x+3
- BC = x+7
- CD = 3y-5
- DA = y+11

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find 'x' such that ABCD is a parallelogram.
- This requires setting up equations based on the properties of a parallelogram (opposite sides equal).
- We need to use AB = CD and BC = DA to solve for 'x'.
- Since the question asks us to find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, we need to use BC=AD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the quadrilateral ABCD and its sides.
- We also need to define the lengths of each side.
- Finally, we need to define the equality of opposite sides for ABCD to be a parallelogram.
