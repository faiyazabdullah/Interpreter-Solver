PROBLEM 2442 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see four lines intersecting at point E.
- The lines are labeled as AB, CD.
- I can see right angle symbols at each of the intersection angles.
- I can see a variable 'x' and degree symbol.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The lines AB and CD are perpendicular to each other.
- The intersection creates four right angles, each measuring 90 degrees.
- The angles labeled 'x' appear to represent these right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Each angle at the intersection E is equal to 'x' degrees.
- The diagram implicitly states that these angles are right angles.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- The angle x is a right angle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the perpendicular lines, right angles, and the 'x' angle.
- The value of a right angle needs to be expressed.
