PROBLEM 2571 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with points E, F, G, and H lying on the circumference of the circle.
- There are two chords, EH and FG, intersecting at a point labeled J.
- Arc EF is labeled with the expression 10x-4.
- Arc GH is labeled with the expression 8x+6.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The chords EH and FG intersect inside the circle.
- Arcs EF and GH are intercepted by angles formed by the chords EH and FG.
- According to the intersecting chords theorem, the intercepted arcs have a specific relationship when the chords intersect within the circle.
- Measure of arc EF = 10x-4
- Measure of arc GH = 8x+6

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of arc EF = 10x-4
- Measure of arc GH = 8x+6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking to find the value of x.
- According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of the intercepted arcs must be equal.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points on the circle, chords, arcs, and their measurements.
- Need to show the relation that intercepted arcs are equal.
