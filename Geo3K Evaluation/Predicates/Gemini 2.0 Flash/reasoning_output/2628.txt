PROBLEM 2628 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot M, F L = 24, H J = 48, and m \widehat H P = 65. Find N J.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center M.
- There are several points on the circle: F, H, K, P, J, G.
- There are chords FG and HJ in the circle.
- There is a line segment KL passing through the center M, intersecting FG at L.
- There is a line segment PN passing through the center M, intersecting HJ at N.
- There is a right angle at L and a right angle at N.
- FL = 24, HJ = 48 and m(arc HP) = 65.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- KL is perpendicular to FG, thus L is the midpoint of FG.
- PN is perpendicular to HJ, thus N is the midpoint of HJ.
- Since L is the midpoint of FG, FL = LG.
- Since N is the midpoint of HJ, HN = NJ.
- M is the center of the circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FL = 24
- HJ = 48
- m(arc HP) = 65

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of NJ.
- Since N is the midpoint of HJ, NJ = HJ/2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the circle, points, lines, perpendicularity, midpoints, and the given lengths.
