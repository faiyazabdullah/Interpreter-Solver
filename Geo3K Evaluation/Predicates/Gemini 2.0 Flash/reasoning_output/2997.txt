PROBLEM 2997 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- Points F, G, H, and J lie on the circle.
- Line segment FG and line segment HJ are chords of the circle.
- Triangle HBJ is formed inside the circle.
- Angle F is 70 degrees.
- Line segment FG and HJ are congruent.
- I need to find the measure of angle HBJ, labeled as 'x'.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since FG and HJ are congruent chords, the arcs FG and HJ are congruent.
- The inscribed angle theorem relates the measure of an inscribed angle to the measure of the intercepted arc.
- Angle F intercepts arc HG.
- Angles HBJ and angle HFJ intercept arc HJ.
- Triangles HBJ are isosceles.
- Angle HBJ = angle HJB.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle F = 70 degrees.
- Because FG = HJ, Arc(FG) = Arc(HJ).
- Therefore Angle(FBG)= Angle(HBJ).
- Angle F intercepts arc HG. Therefore, arc HG = 2 * Angle F = 2 * 70 = 140 degrees.
- Since triangle HBJ is formed by radii of the circle, it is an isosceles triangle. Therefore HB = BJ. So, angle HBJ = angle HJB
- Angle HBJ = Angle HJB = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is asking for the value of x, which represents the measure of angle HBJ.
- The measure of angle HBJ is needed. Since triangle HBJ is an isosceles triangle, angle HBJ= angle HJB = x.
- Angle BHJ = 180-2x
- We know that HJ=FG. Since they are congruent chords, their intercepted arcs are equal.
- Since arc FG = arc HJ then angle FBG = angle HBJ.
- Since angle FBG is the central angle for arc FG and angle F = 70, then angle FBG = 2*angleF (central angle = 2*inscribed angle) therefore 140.
- arc HJ = arc FG, and since F =70, HJ=140, then the angle HBJ = x. 

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all the geometric shapes
- Represent all the given information
- Relate the arcs and angles
- Represent isoceles triangle
