PROBLEM 2598 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of \triangle R U W if \triangle R U W \sim \triangle S T V, S T = 24, V S = 12, V T = 18 and U W = 21.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, \triangle RUW and \triangle STV.
- The vertices are labeled R, U, W, S, T, V.
- I am given the following side lengths: ST = 24, VS = 12, VT = 18, UW = 21.
- I am also given that \triangle RUW \sim \triangle STV.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \triangle RUW \sim \triangle STV, the corresponding sides are proportional.
- That is, RU/ST = UW/VT = RW/SV.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ST = 24
- VS = 12
- VT = 18
- UW = 21
- I want to find the perimeter of \triangle RUW.
- Perimeter of \triangle RUW = RU + UW + RW.
- Need to find RU and RW.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of \triangle RUW.
- I know that \triangle RUW \sim \triangle STV.
- I can set up proportions to find the lengths of sides RU and RW.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I will need to represent the triangles, the given side lengths, and the similarity relationship.
- I will use the following relationships to find the unknown side lengths:
  - RU/ST = UW/VT
  - RW/SV = UW/VT
- I will then calculate the perimeter of triangle RUW using the formula RU + UW + RW.
