PROBLEM 2478 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If \triangle L M N \sim \triangle Q R S, Q R = 35, R S = 37, S Q = 12, and N L = 5, find the perimeter of \triangle L M N.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles: triangle QRS and triangle LMN.
- Triangle QRS has vertices Q, R, and S.
- Triangle LMN has vertices L, M, and N.
- The length of side QR is 35.
- The length of side RS is 37.
- The length of side SQ is 12.
- The length of side NL is 5.
- Angle Q is a right angle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle QRS is a right triangle because angle Q is a right angle.
- Triangle LMN is similar to triangle QRS (given).
- Since the triangles are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- QR = 35
- RS = 37
- SQ = 12
- NL = 5
- Perimeter of triangle LMN is to be found.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the perimeter of triangle LMN.
- The triangles are similar, so their sides are proportional.
- We can use the proportion of the sides to find the lengths of sides LM and MN.
- Perimeter is the sum of the sides, so we can find the perimeter once all side lengths are known.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the two triangles.
- Define the side lengths of triangle QRS.
- Define the side length NL of triangle LMN.
- State that triangle LMN is similar to triangle QRS.
- State that Angle Q is a right angle.
- Express that the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides.
