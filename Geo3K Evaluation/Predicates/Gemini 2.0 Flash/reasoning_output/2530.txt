PROBLEM 2530 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle K.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral JKLM.
- Points J, K, L, and M are vertices of the quadrilateral.
- Line segments JK and ML appear parallel.
- The length of line segments JM and KL is given as 6.
- The measure of angle M is given as 80 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The quadrilateral JKLM is a trapezoid because JK and ML are parallel.
- JM and KL are legs of the trapezoid and are congruent, so the trapezoid is an isosceles trapezoid.
- In an isosceles trapezoid, base angles are congruent.
- Therefore, angle L is congruent to angle M, and angle J is congruent to angle K.
- Also, consecutive angles between parallel sides are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of JM = 6
- Length of KL = 6
- Measure of angle M = 80 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of angle K.
- Since JKLM is an isosceles trapezoid, the consecutive angles M and K are supplementary.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the quadrilateral, points, line segments, angles.
- Represent the parallel sides.
- Represent the given measurements.
- Represent the fact that it is an isosceles trapezoid.
- Represent the relationship between supplementary angles.
