PROBLEM 2852 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two congruent right triangles, ABC and ADC.
- Point C is the intersection of line segment BD and line AE.
- Line AE is a straight line.
- Segments BC and CD are congruent.
- Line segment AC is perpendicular to line segment BD.
- The length of AD is given as 4.1.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangles ABC and ADC are right triangles sharing side AC.
- BC and CD are congruent, and AC is perpendicular to BD.
- Angle BCA and angle DCA are right angles.
- Since BC = CD and angle BCA = angle DCA = 90 degrees, and AC is a common side, Triangle ABC is congruent to triangle ADC by Side-Angle-Side (SAS) congruence.
- Therefore, AB = AD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of AD = 4.1

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AB.
- Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle ADC, AB = AD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- State that triangles ABC and ADC are right triangles.
- State that segments BC and CD are congruent.
- State that segment AC is perpendicular to segment BD.
- State that AD = 4.1.
- State that triangles ABC and ADC are congruent.
- State that AB = AD.
