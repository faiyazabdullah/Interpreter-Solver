PROBLEM 2449 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle W.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a pentagon UVWYZ with vertices labeled U, V, W, Y, Z.
- Angle at vertex U is labeled (x - 8) degrees.
- Angle at vertex V is labeled (3x - 11) degrees.
- Angle at vertex W is labeled (x + 8) degrees.
- Angle at vertex Z is labeled (2x + 7) degrees.
- Angle at vertex Y is labeled x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a pentagon, which means it has five sides and five angles.
- The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is (5-2) * 180 = 540 degrees.
- The sum of the given angles must be equal to 540 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The angles are given as expressions in terms of x.
- U = (x - 8)
- V = (3x - 11)
- W = (x + 8)
- Z = (2x + 7)
- Y = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle W.
- This requires finding the value of x and then substituting it into the expression (x + 8).
- We need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540 degrees to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the pentagon, the angles, and the relationship of the sum of the angles.
- Need to represent the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is 540.
- Need to express the measures of each angle.
