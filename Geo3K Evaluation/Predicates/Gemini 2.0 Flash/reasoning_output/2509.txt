================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 123. Find the measure of \angle 14.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see lines intersecting at points U and A.
- There are labeled points: F, G, N, H, J, M, I, E, K, U, Q, A.
- There are labeled angles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.
- There are arrows indicating the direction of lines extending from certain points.
- I am given that m \angle 1 = 123.
- Parallel lines are suggested by the diagram.
- The intersection of lines forms angles.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line NU intersects line HI at point U.
- Line GA intersects line FK at point K.
- Line MA intersects line JI at point A.
- Line AE intersects line JI at point Q.
- Angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary.
- Angle 5 and angle 6 are supplementary.
- Lines NU and AE appear parallel.
- Lines GA and MA appear parallel.
- Lines FK and JI appear parallel.
- Angle 1 and angle 7 are vertical angles, and hence are congruent.
- Angle 2 and angle 8 are vertical angles, and hence are congruent.
- Angle 3 and angle 5 are vertical angles, and hence are congruent.
- Angle 4 and angle 6 are vertical angles, and hence are congruent.
- Angle 9 and angle 15 are vertical angles, and hence are congruent.
- Angle 10 and angle 16 are vertical angles, and hence are congruent.
- Angle 11 and angle 13 are vertical angles, and hence are congruent.
- Angle 12 and angle 14 are vertical angles, and hence are congruent.
- Since line NU and line AE appear parallel, angle 1 is congruent to angle 5 (corresponding angles). Also angle 2 is congruent to angle 6.
- Since line GA and line MA appear parallel, angle 9 is congruent to angle 13 (corresponding angles). Also angle 10 is congruent to angle 14.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 123
- Because Angle 1 and Angle 2 are supplementary, m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 = 180.
- Since m \angle 1 = 123, m \angle 2 = 180 - 123 = 57.
- Since line NU and line AE appear parallel, m \angle 1 = m \angle 5 = 123. Also m \angle 2 = m \angle 6 = 57.
- Angle 3 and angle 5 are vertical angles, so m \angle 3 = m \angle 5 = 123.
- Angle 4 and angle 6 are vertical angles, so m \angle 4 = m \angle 6 = 57.
- Since line GA and line MA appear parallel, Angle 10 is congruent to Angle 14.
- If line NU and line AE are parallel and line GA and line MA are parallel, angle 2 and angle 14 are alternate interior angles and thus m \angle 2 = m \angle 14 = 57.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the measure of \angle 14.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the given angle, the supplementary angles, parallel lines and corresponding angles, and vertical angles.
