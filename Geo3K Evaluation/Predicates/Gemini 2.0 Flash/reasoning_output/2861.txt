PROBLEM 2861 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, line l is parallel to line m. Line n intersects both l and m. Which of the following lists includes all of the angles that are supplementary to \angle 1?
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines, l and m.
- I can see a transversal line, n, intersecting both parallel lines.
- I can see points labeled A, B, C, E, F, G, N.
- I can see angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- The lines l and m have arrows indicating their direction, however they are infinite lines.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line l is parallel to line m.
- Line n intersects line l at a point (implied between angles 1, 2, 3, 4)
- Line n intersects line m at a point (implied between angles 5, 6, 7, 8)
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are supplementary angles.
- Angle 1 and Angle 4 are vertical angles and hence equal.
- Angle 1 and Angle 3 are supplementary angles.
- Angle 5 and Angle 1 are corresponding angles and hence equal.
- Angle 7 and Angle 1 are alternate exterior angles and hence equal.
- Angle 3 and Angle 5 are same-side interior angles, and thus are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- No numerical values are given in the diagram.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to identify the angles supplementary to angle 1.
- Two angles are supplementary if their sum is 180 degrees.
- Based on the parallel lines and transversal, angles 2, 3, 5, and 7 are candidates.
- Angle 3 is supplementary to Angle 1 because together, they form a straight line.
- Angle 2 is supplementary to Angle 1 because together, they form a straight line.
- Angle 6 and angle 8 are supplementary to angles 5 and 7, respectively, since lines l and m are parallel to each other.
- Angle 5 is supplementary to angle 4, because line m passes through angles 5 and 6.
- Angle 7 and angle 6 are supplementary angles.
- Angle 1 = Angle 4, so angles that are supplementary to angle 4 will be supplementary to angle 1.
- Angle 5 is supplementary to angle 3, so angles that are supplementary to angle 5 will be supplementary to angle 3.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the lines, angles, and points.
- Represent the parallel relationship between lines l and m.
- Represent the intersection of line n with lines l and m.
- Represent the supplementary angle relationships.
- Represent the equal angle relationships (vertical, corresponding, alternate exterior).
