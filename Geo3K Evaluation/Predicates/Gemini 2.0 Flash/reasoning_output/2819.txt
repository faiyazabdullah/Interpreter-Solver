PROBLEM 2819 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the rhombus.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rhombus labeled with vertices A, B, C, and D.
- The diagonals of the rhombus are AC and BD, and they intersect at point E.
- The length of AC is labeled as 17 inches.
- The length of DE is labeled as 8 inches. Since diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other, DE = EA = 8 inches, so BD = 16 inches
- The diagonals are perpendicular.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is identified as a rhombus, therefore opposite sides are parallel and all sides are equal in length.
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
- The point E is the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 17 inches
- DE = 8 inches, so BD = 2 * DE = 16 inches
- Area of a rhombus = 1/2 * d1 * d2 where d1 and d2 are the diagonals

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the rhombus.
- We know the lengths of both diagonals, AC and BD.
- We can calculate the area using the formula.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the rhombus, its vertices, diagonals, their intersection point, the lengths of the diagonals, and the formula for area calculation.
