PROBLEM 2822 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For trapezoid T R S V, M and N are midpoints of the legs. If T R = 32 and M N = 25, find V S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a trapezoid TRSV with vertices labeled T, R, S, V.
- Points M and N lie on sides TV and RS respectively.
- Line segment MN connects M and N.
- TR = 32 and MN = 25 are given lengths.
- M is the midpoint of TV, N is the midpoint of RS.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- TRSV is a trapezoid.
- MN is the midsegment of the trapezoid.
- TR and VS are the bases of the trapezoid.
- M is the midpoint of leg TV.
- N is the midpoint of leg RS.
- MN is parallel to TR and VS.
- The midsegment of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the bases: MN = (TR + VS)/2

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- TR = 32
- MN = 25
- VS is the unknown length that needs to be calculated.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of VS.
- This requires using the formula for the length of the midsegment of a trapezoid: MN = (TR + VS)/2

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the trapezoid, midpoints, given lengths, and the relationship between the midsegment and bases.
