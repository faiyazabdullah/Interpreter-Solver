PROBLEM 2984 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle Y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z
- Angle at vertex X is labeled as 'a' degrees
- Angle at vertex Y is labeled as '(a - 28)' degrees
- Angle at vertex W is labeled as '((1/2)a + 8)' degrees
- Angle at vertex Z is labeled as '(a + 2)' degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The figure is a quadrilateral.
- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle X = a
- m \angle Y = (a - 28)
- m \angle W = ((1/2)a + 8)
- m \angle Z = (a + 2)
- The sum of the angles of quadrilateral WXYZ = 360 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find m \angle Y.
- The relationship between the angles of quadrilateral WXYZ needs to be established to find the value of 'a', and then substitute the value of 'a' in (a - 28) to find the measure of angle Y.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the quadrilateral, angles, measurements, and relationships
- Must include the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral relationship.
