PROBLEM 2992 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of m \angle 2. Assume that segments that appear tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center G.
- There are two lines intersecting inside the circle at point P.
- There is an angle labeled 85 degrees formed by the lines IA and HB outside the circle.
- There is an arc intercepted by the same lines, measuring 230 degrees.
- There is an angle labeled 2 at point P.
- Points A, P, C, D, and E lie on a straight line.
- Points I, P, H, and B lie on a straight line.
- Points A, C, D, H, and B lie on the circle.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle 85 degrees is formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle.
- The measure of angle 85 degrees is half the difference between the intercepted arcs.
- Angle 2 is an interior angle formed by intersecting chords.
- The measure of angle 2 is half the sum of the intercepted arcs.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of the angle outside the circle = 85 degrees.
- Measure of the major arc intercepted by the angle = 230 degrees.
- The remaining arc of the circle is 360 - 230 = 130 degrees.
- The two intercepted arcs that form angle 2 are 130 degrees and 85 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 2.
- To find it, we need the measures of the intercepted arcs.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the circle and all relevant points and lines.
- State the given angle measurements and arc measures.
- State the relation between the intercepted arcs and the outside angle.
- State that angle 2 is formed by intersecting chords.
