PROBLEM 2632 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, \triangle A B C \sim \triangle D E F. B G is a median of \triangle A B C, and E H is a median of \triangle D E F. Find E H if B C = 30, B G = 15, and E F = 15.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, \triangle ABC and \triangle DEF.
- Point G lies on line AC, and BG is a line segment.
- Point H lies on line DF, and EH is a line segment.
- I am given that \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF.
- I am given that BG is a median of \triangle ABC, meaning G is the midpoint of AC.
- I am given that EH is a median of \triangle DEF, meaning H is the midpoint of DF.
- I am given the lengths: BC = 30, BG = 15, EF = 15.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since \triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF, corresponding sides are proportional, and corresponding angles are equal.
- Since BG is a median, AG = GC.
- Since EH is a median, DH = HF.
- Since BG and EH are medians of similar triangles, their lengths are proportional to the corresponding sides of the triangles.
- Therefore, the ratio of BG to EH equals the ratio of BC to EF.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 30
- BG = 15
- EF = 15
- I want to find EH.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of EH.
- I know that the ratio of corresponding medians in similar triangles is equal to the ratio of corresponding sides.
- Therefore, BG/EH = BC/EF.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need predicates for the triangles, the median properties, the similarity of the triangles, and the given lengths.
- I will include the ratios of the sides and medians.
