PROBLEM 2495 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure containing multiple triangles.
- Triangle ABC has a right angle at C.
- Triangle ABD has a right angle at B.
- Line segment DB has length y.
- Line segment BC has length 8.
- Line segment CA has length x.
- Line segment BA has length z.
- Line segment DC has length 6.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- Triangle ABD is a right triangle.
- Lines DB and AB are perpendicular.
- Lines AC and BC are perpendicular.
- The points D, C, and A are collinear.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DC = 6
- BC = 8
- DB = y
- CA = x
- BA = z

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of z.
- Need to use Pythagorean theorem in both triangles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines, triangles, and right angles.
- Express the lengths of the line segments.
- State Pythagorean theorem for both triangles.
- Express that D, C, and A are collinear.
