PROBLEM 2453 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diagonals of rhombus F G H J intersect at K. If G H = x + 9 and J H = 5 x - 2, find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a quadrilateral FGHJ.
- The quadrilateral appears to be a rhombus.
- The diagonals FH and GJ intersect at point K.
- GH = x + 9
- JH = 5x - 2

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since FGHJ is a rhombus, all its sides are congruent.
- Therefore, GH = JH.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GH = x + 9
- JH = 5x - 2
- Since GH = JH, we can set up the equation x + 9 = 5x - 2.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks us to find the value of x.
- We know that GH = JH, so x + 9 = 5x - 2.
- Solving this equation will give us the value of x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the shape as a rhombus
- Define the sides of the rhombus
- Express the given relationships between the sides using equations
- Set up equality for the sides
