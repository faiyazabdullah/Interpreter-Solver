PROBLEM 2895 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a triangle ABC.
- Inside triangle ABC, there is a line segment CD, with point D on line segment AB.
- Angle ACB and Angle CDA are right angles.
- The length of AD is 3, the length of DB is 12.
- The length of AC is labeled y, the length of BC is labeled z, and the length of CD is labeled x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- Triangle ADC is a right triangle.
- Triangle CDB is a right triangle.
- CD is perpendicular to AB.
- AC is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 3
- DB = 12
- AC = y
- BC = z
- CD = x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of z, which is the length of BC.
- Since ABC is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem can be used, along with the fact that the two smaller triangles are similar to the bigger one and thus to each other.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all the points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- Specify the right angles.
- Specify the lengths of the line segments.
- State that the triangles are similar.
- Express the relationships between the sides based on similarity or Pythagorean theorem.
