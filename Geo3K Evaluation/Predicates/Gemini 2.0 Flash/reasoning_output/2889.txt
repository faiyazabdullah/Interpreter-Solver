PROBLEM 2889 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle DGF.
- The vertices are labeled D, G, and F.
- Side DG is marked as 15 units.
- Side GF is marked as 19 units.
- Angle DGF is marked as 125 degrees.
- Side DF is labeled as x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle DGF is a triangle.
- The sides are DG, GF, and DF.
- Angle DGF is an obtuse angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DG = 15 units (given)
- GF = 19 units (given)
- Angle DGF = 125 degrees (given)
- DF = x (unknown)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x.
- This can be found using the Law of Cosines.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, the sides, the angle, and the Law of Cosines.
