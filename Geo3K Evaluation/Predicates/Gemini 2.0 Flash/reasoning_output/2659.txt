PROBLEM 2659 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find \widehat W N if \triangle I W N is equilateral and W N = 5.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center I.
- I can see a triangle IW N.
- The vertices of the triangle are labeled I, W, and N.
- The triangle IWN is equilateral.
- W and N are points on the circle.
- The length of WN is 5.
- I need to find the measure of arc WN.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since triangle IWN is equilateral, all its sides are equal in length.
- All angles in an equilateral triangle are 60 degrees.
- The sides IW and IN are radii of the circle.
- Angle WIN is a central angle that subtends arc WN.
- The measure of a central angle equals the measure of the arc it subtends.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- WN = 5
- IW = IN = WN = 5 because triangle IWN is equilateral.
- Angle WIN = 60 degrees since triangle IWN is equilateral.
- The measure of arc WN is equal to the measure of central angle WIN.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc WN.
- I know that the measure of arc WN is equal to the measure of central angle WIN.
- Since triangle IWN is equilateral, the measure of angle WIN is 60 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define the points, triangle, circle, and arc.
- Need to specify that the triangle is equilateral and WN = 5.
- Need to define that IW and IN are radii of the circle.
- Need to define the angle WIN.
- Need to equate the measure of the angle WIN to the measure of arc WN.
