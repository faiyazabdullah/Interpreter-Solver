PROBLEM 2405 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure below, \angle A B C is intersected by parallel lines l and m. What is the measure of \angle A B C? Express your answer in degrees.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines labeled l and m.
- There are points labeled A, B, and C.
- There are rays extending from A and C.
- The angle between line l and line AB is 38 degrees.
- The angle between line m and line BC is 33 degrees.
- The angle ABC is being asked for.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line l is parallel to line m.
- Line segments AB and BC intersect line l and line m, respectively.
- Angles are formed by the intersection of line segments and lines.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle between line l and AB is 38 degrees.
- Angle between line m and BC is 33 degrees.
- Need to use these angles to find angle ABC.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle ABC.
- This requires using properties of parallel lines and angles formed by transversals.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallel lines, points, and angles.
- Need to represent the relationships between angles formed by the parallel lines and transversals.
