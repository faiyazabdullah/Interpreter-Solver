PROBLEM 2938 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of x in the diagram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a polygon with 7 sides (Heptagon) and exterior angles labeled.
- The exterior angles are: (x-10), (x-20), 21, 42, 29, (x+14), and x.
- The vertices are labeled as E, C, G, B, D, H, and E

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is 360 degrees.
- The diagram shows a heptagon with labeled exterior angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The measurements represent the exterior angles of the heptagon.
- The exterior angles are given as algebraic expressions or numbers.
- The sum of these angles must equal 360 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of x.
- We know the sum of exterior angles of a polygon is 360 degrees.
- So, we can set up an equation: (x-10) + (x-20) + 21 + 42 + 29 + (x+14) + x = 360

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the polygon.
- Define the angles with expressions given.
- State that the sum of the exterior angles is 360 degrees.
