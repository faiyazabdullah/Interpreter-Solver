PROBLEM 2402 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Circle O has a radius of 13 inches. Radius O B is perpendicular to chord C D which is 24 inches long. Find O X.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- Points C, B, and D lie on the circumference of circle O.
- Line segment CD is a chord of the circle.
- Line segment OB is a radius of the circle.
- Line segment OX is a portion of radius OB.
- Line segment OB is perpendicular to chord CD at point X.
- Length of CD is 24 inches.
- Radius of the circle is 13 inches.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since OB is perpendicular to CD, X is the midpoint of CD.
- OC is a radius of the circle.
- Triangle OCX is a right triangle, with right angle at X.
- Length of OC is equal to Length of OB which is the radius.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of CD = 24 inches. Therefore, length of CX = CD/2 = 12 inches.
- Length of OB = Length of OC = 13 inches (radius of circle).
- Triangle OCX is a right triangle. We know OC and CX.
- OX is what we need to find.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the length of OX.
- We have the lengths of OC and CX.
- Using the Pythagorean theorem on triangle OCX, we can determine the length of OX.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define circle O, points, lines, and angles
- Show that CD is a chord.
- Show that OB is perpendicular to CD.
- State lengths of CD, OB, and OC.
- Indicate that X is the midpoint of CD.
- Show that OCX is a right triangle.
- State Pythagorean theorem as it applies to OCX.
