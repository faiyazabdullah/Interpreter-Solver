PROBLEM 2686 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle A B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a figure with points labeled A, B, C, and D.
- There are line segments connecting these points: AD, AC, AB, DB.
- Angle ADB is labeled as 92 degrees.
- There are congruent markings indicating that AD = DC and AC = CB.
- I can see triangles ADC and ABC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ADC is isosceles, with AD = DC.
- Triangle ACB is isosceles, with AC = CB.
- Angle ADB is an obtuse angle.
- Points D, C, and B lie on the same line.
- Line AD is perpendicular to DC.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle ADB = 92 degrees.
- AD = DC
- AC = CB
- Angle ADC and angle CDB are supplementary.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle ABC.
- Since triangle ABC is isosceles, angles BAC and ABC are congruent.
- We can find angle ACB using the fact that angles in a triangle add up to 180 degrees.
- We can relate angle ACB to angles ADC and CDB since they lie on a straight line.
- We can find angle ADC in triangle ADC since it is isosceles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent points, lines, angles and triangles.
- Represent the given measurements (angle ADB and congruent sides).
- Represent that D, C, B are collinear.
- Represent that angles in a triangle sum to 180.
- Represent that triangle ADC and triangle ABC are isosceles.
