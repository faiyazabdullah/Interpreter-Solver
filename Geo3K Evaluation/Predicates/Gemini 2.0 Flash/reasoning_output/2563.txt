PROBLEM 2563 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram J K L M to find m \angle K J L.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram JKLM with diagonals JL and KM intersecting at point R.
- The length of side ML is given as 45.
- The length of side KL is given as 21.
- The length of side JK is given as 2b+3.
- The length of side MJ is given as 3a.
- The angle MLK is labeled with 70 degrees.
- The angle KLM is labeled with 30 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- JKLM is a parallelogram, meaning opposite sides are parallel and congruent.
- Opposite angles are congruent.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary.
- Diagonals bisect each other.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- ML = 45, KL = 21, JK = 2b+3, MJ = 3a
- Angle MLK = 70 degrees, Angle KLM = 30 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find m \angle KJL
- In parallelogram JKLM, sides JK and ML are parallel.
- Therefore, angle KJL is equal to angle JLM, which is equal to 30 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram.
- Represent all sides and given lengths.
- Represent all the angles.
- Represent any other relationships, like congruency of opposite sides, opposite angles, supplementary consecutive angles, parallel sides.
