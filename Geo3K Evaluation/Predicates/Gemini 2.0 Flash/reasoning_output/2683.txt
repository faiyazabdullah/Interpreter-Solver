PROBLEM 2683 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find P Q.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows four points P, T, R, and S.
- There is a point Q where the lines PT and SR intersect.
- There are segments PQ, QT, SR, QR.
- The length of QT is given as 3.
- The length of PQ is given as 6-x.
- The length of QR is given as 6+x.
- The length of SR is given as 3+x.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- There are two triangles: PQT and SQR.
- There is an intersection point Q between segments PT and SR.
- There is no information about any parallel or perpendicular lines.
- There is no indication of any congruent triangles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- PQ = 6 - x
- QT = 3
- QR = 6 + x
- SR = 3 + x

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of PQ.
- PQ is given as 6-x. We need to find x.
- The triangles might be similar. Let's explore this possibility.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all given points, lines, segments and their lengths.
