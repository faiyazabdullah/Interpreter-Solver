PROBLEM 2824 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: M C = 7, R M = 4, and A T = 16. Find M S.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with points R, S, T lying on sides AC, AB, BC respectively.
- I can see that lines AS, BT, CR intersect at a common point M.
- There are congruence markings on AR and RC, AS and SB, BT and TC.
- I can see the lengths: M C = 7, R M = 4, and A T = 16.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- R, S, and T are midpoints of sides AC, AB, and BC respectively since AR = RC, AS = SB, and BT = TC.
- Therefore AR = RC, AS = SB, BT = TC
- Since the lines connect vertices to midpoints of opposite sides, they are medians.
- Point M is the centroid.
- Given AT = 16

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- MC = 7
- RM = 4
- AT = 16

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of MS.
- Knowing M is the centroid, we know that the medians are divided in a 2:1 ratio with the longer segment from the vertex to the centroid.
- The section of the median from the centroid to midpoint of the opposite side is one half the length of the section between the vertex and the centroid.
- We have RM = 4, then AM = 2 * RM = 2 * 4 = 8, so AR = RM/2, and CR = RM.
- We have MC = 7. Using that M is the centroid, we have CR:RM which = 2:1, and we have CM = 2 * MR.
- Since AM is split into AS and SM, we need to utilize the fact that AM is 2/3 of the length of median AS.
- And since SM is the shorter segment, we have AM = 2 * MS, so MS = AM/2.
- Since AT = 16, and M is the centroid, we also have AM:MS = 2:1 or AM = (2/3) AS.
- From that, we can also get MT.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define all points, lines, triangles.
- Need to use congruence relations
- Need to specify measurements.
- Need to specify centroid relationships
- Need to relate the line segment ratio relationships from vertex-centroid-midpoint of the side
- Capture the ratios of the medians and their subsegments
