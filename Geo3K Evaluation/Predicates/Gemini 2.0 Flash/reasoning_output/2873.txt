PROBLEM 2873 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AC is marked as 6 units
- Side AB is marked as y units
- Side BC is marked as x units
- Angle ABC is marked as 30 degrees
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at A
- Sides AC and AB are perpendicular
- Side BC is the hypotenuse
- Angle ABC is 30 degrees

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 6 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 30 degrees (given)
- We need to find y, which is the length of AB.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AB, which is represented by y.
- We can use trigonometric ratios to find the length of AB (y).
- cos(30) = adjacent/hypotenuse = x/y
- sin(30) = opposite/hypotenuse = 6/y
- y = 6/sin(30)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships.
- Use trigonometric relationship sine to find side y.
