PROBLEM 2850 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral E F G H is a rectangle. If E F = 4 x - 6 and H G = x + 3, find E F.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle EFGH.
- The vertices of the rectangle are E, F, G, and H.
- The diagonals EG and FH intersect at point K.
- There is a right angle at vertex H, indicated by a square symbol.
- Length EF is labeled as 4x - 6.
- Length HG is labeled as x + 3.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since EFGH is a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel and congruent.
- Therefore, EF is parallel to HG and EF = HG.
- EH is parallel to FG and EH = FG.
- All angles in a rectangle are right angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- EF = 4x - 6
- HG = x + 3
- Since EFGH is a rectangle, EF = HG.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of EF.
- We need to use the property that opposite sides of a rectangle are equal to solve for x.
- Then substitute the value of x into the expression for EF.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the rectangle EFGH
- State that EF = 4x - 6 and HG = x + 3.
- State that EF = HG because EFGH is a rectangle.
