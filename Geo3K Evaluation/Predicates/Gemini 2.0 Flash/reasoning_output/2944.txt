PROBLEM 2944 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadrilateral W X Y Z is a rectangle. Find the measure of \angle 2 if m \angle 1 = 30.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral WXYZ.
- WXYZ appears to be a rectangle based on the right angle symbol at Y.
- The diagonals WX and YZ intersect at a point A.
- Angle 1 and angle 2 are formed at vertex X.
- Angle 6 is a right angle at vertex Y.
- Given m \angle 1 = 30.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral WXYZ is a rectangle.
- Angle Y is a right angle.
- Diagonals of a rectangle are congruent.
- Diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other.
- The sides WX and YZ are parallel, as are WY and XZ.
- Angle 2 and angle 3 are complementary (add up to 90 degrees) since angle Z is a right angle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 30 degrees.
- m \angle 6 = 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of \angle 2.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Predicates are needed to represent: the rectangle, right angle, given angle measure, and the fact that WXYZ is a rectangle.
- Represent the properties of the rectangle, such as the fact that all angles are right angles.
