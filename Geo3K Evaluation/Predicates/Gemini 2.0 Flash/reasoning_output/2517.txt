PROBLEM 2517 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \overrightarrow B A and \overrightarrow B C are opposite rays and \overrightarrow B D bisects \angle A B F. If m \angle F B C = 2 x + 25 and m \angle A B F = 10 x - 1, find m \angle D B F.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, E, F.
- I can see rays BA, BC, BD, BF.
- I can see angles FBC, ABF.
- The image provides information about the angles FBC and ABF.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Ray BA and ray BC are opposite rays, meaning angle ABC is a straight angle.
- Ray BD bisects angle ABF, so angle ABD is congruent to angle DBF.
- Angle ABF and angle FBC are supplementary angles (they form a straight angle when combined with CBA).
- Therefore, m∠ABF + m∠FBC = 180 degrees.
- Given that m∠FBC = 2x + 25 and m∠ABF = 10x - 1, we have the equation (2x + 25) + (10x - 1) = 180.
- Since BD bisects angle ABF, m∠DBF = (1/2) * m∠ABF.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠FBC = 2x + 25
- m∠ABF = 10x - 1

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle DBF.
- We know m∠ABF = 10x - 1 and BD bisects angle ABF, so m∠DBF = (1/2) * m∠ABF = (1/2) * (10x - 1).
- To find the measure of angle DBF, we first need to find the value of x using the equation m∠ABF + m∠FBC = 180, which translates to (10x - 1) + (2x + 25) = 180.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the points, rays, angles, and the given relationships.
- Need to represent that BA and BC are opposite rays.
- Need to represent that BD bisects angle ABF.
- Need to represent the angle measures m∠FBC = 2x + 25 and m∠ABF = 10x - 1.
- Need to represent that m∠ABF + m∠FBC = 180.
- Need to represent that m∠DBF = (1/2) * m∠ABF.
