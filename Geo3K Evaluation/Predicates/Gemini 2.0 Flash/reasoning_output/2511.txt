PROBLEM 2511 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC.
- Side AC is labeled with the variable x.
- Side BC is labeled with the variable x.
- Side AB is labeled with the number 20.
- There is a right angle marking at vertex C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- Sides AC and BC are legs of the right triangle.
- Side AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- Sides AC and BC are of equal length (x).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = x
- BC = x
- AB = 20
- Angle ACB = 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- The Pythagorean theorem can be used to solve for x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent triangle ABC, the right angle at C, and the lengths of the sides.
- Represent the Pythagorean theorem relationship between the sides.
