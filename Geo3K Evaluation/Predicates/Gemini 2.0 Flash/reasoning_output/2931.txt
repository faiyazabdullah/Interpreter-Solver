PROBLEM 2931 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find w in the given parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram FGHJ with vertices labeled F, G, H, J
- Point A is the intersection of diagonals FH and GJ
- Length FA is labeled as 4w-7
- Length AG is labeled as 2b+5
- Length AJ is labeled as 3b+1
- Length AH is labeled as 2w+3

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- FGHJ is a parallelogram.
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
- Therefore, FA = AH and AG = AJ.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- FA = 4w - 7
- AH = 2w + 3
- AG = 2b + 5
- AJ = 3b + 1

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of w.
- Need to use the property FA = AH to solve for w.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the parallelogram and the intersection point.
- State that diagonals bisect each other in a parallelogram
- Equate the expressions for FA and AH.
