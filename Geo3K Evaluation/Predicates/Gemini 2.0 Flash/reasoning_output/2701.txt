PROBLEM 2701 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram W X Y Z to find m \angle X Y Z.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram WXYZ with vertices labeled W, X, Y, Z.
- The length of side XY is 24 units.
- The length of side ZY is 28 units.
- The measure of angle W is 105 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Parallelogram WXYZ has opposite sides that are parallel and congruent.
- Opposite angles are congruent.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary.
- Therefore, angle W and angle Z are opposite, angles X and Y are opposite, so angles W and Z are congruent.
- Sides WX and ZY are opposite and therefore congruent.
- Sides WZ and XY are opposite and therefore congruent.
- Angles W and X are consecutive, angles X and Y are consecutive, angles Y and Z are consecutive, angles Z and W are consecutive, so angles W and X, X and Y, Y and Z, and Z and W are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- XY = 24 units (given)
- ZY = 28 units (given)
- Measure of angle W = 105 degrees (given)
- Since opposite sides are equal, WZ = XY = 24 units.
- Since opposite sides are equal, WX = ZY = 28 units.
- Since W and Z are opposite angles in parallelogram WXYZ, angle W = angle Z, so angle Z is also 105 degrees.
- Since angles W and X are consecutive, angle W + angle X = 180, so 105 + angle X = 180, and angle X = 75 degrees.
- Since angles X and Y are opposite angles in parallelogram WXYZ, angle X = angle Y = 75 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle XYZ.
- Angle XYZ is opposite to angle W and it equals angle X.
- The measure of angle XYZ equals 75 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the parallelogram, side lengths, angle measure, parallel sides, and supplementary angles.
