PROBLEM 2843 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle L M N \cong \triangle Q R S. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, triangle LMN and triangle QRS
- Side LM is adjacent to angle (y+6)째
- Side QS is adjacent to angle (2y-12)째
- Length of LN is 3x+5
- Length of QS is 2x+10
- The triangles are congruent: \triangle L M N \cong \triangle Q R S

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the triangles are congruent, corresponding sides and angles are equal.
- \angle LNM = \angle QSR
- LN = QS

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- \angle LNM = (y+6)째
- \angle QSR = (2y-12)째
- LN = 3x+5
- QS = 2x+10

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find x.
- I need to use the information given about the length of the sides to find x.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the triangles and the angles.
- Define the equality of angles and the sides.
