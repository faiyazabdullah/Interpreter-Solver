PROBLEM 2516 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \triangle R S V \cong \triangle T V S. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two triangles, \triangle RSV and \triangle TVS.
- Point R, V, S, and T are labeled.
- Line segments RS, SV, VT, and TS are visible.
- Angle RVT is labeled as 78 degrees.
- Angle STV is labeled as x degrees.
- There is a right angle at angle RSV (indicated by the square symbol).
- RS has a length of 2y-1.
- VT has a length of 24.
- ST has a length of 24.5.
- VS has a length implicitly shown to be the same for both triangles due to a congruent mark.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- \triangle RSV and \triangle TVS share a common side VS.
- Angle RSV is a right angle.
- VS is perpendicular to RS.
- The problem states \triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of RS is 2y-1.
- Length of ST is 24.5.
- Length of VT is 24.
- Length of SV is shared between the two triangles.
- Angle RVT is 78 degrees.
- Angle STV is x degrees.
- Since the triangles are congruent and VS is perpendicular to RS, angle VST is also a right angle.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- Since \triangle RSV \cong \triangle TVS, this means all sides and angles are congruent.
- Therefore, angle SVR must be congruent to angle VTS, meaning angle SVR is x.
- Since the sum of angles in triangle RVT would be 180, we are able to set up an equation.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent all the triangles, lines, points, and angle present.
- I also need to represent the length values given.
- I need to represent perpendicularity and the right angle.
- The congruence relationship between the two triangles must be represented.
