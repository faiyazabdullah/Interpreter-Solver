PROBLEM 2514 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find K J if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle GJI with vertices labeled G, J, I
- There is a line segment KH inside the triangle, parallel to JI
- Points K and H lie on GJ and GI respectively
- GJ = 8, GH = 12, HI = 4

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line segment KH is parallel to JI, indicated by the arrow markings.
- Triangle GKH is similar to triangle GJI due to parallel lines (AA similarity).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- GJ = 8
- GH = 12
- HI = 4. Therefore GI = GH + HI = 12 + 4 = 16

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of KJ.
- We can use the similarity of triangles GKH and GJI to set up a proportion to find GK, and then subtract GK from GJ to find KJ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points and lines
- State the given lengths.
- State that KH is parallel to JI
- State that GKH and GJI are similar triangles
- Establish the proportional relationship between corresponding sides
