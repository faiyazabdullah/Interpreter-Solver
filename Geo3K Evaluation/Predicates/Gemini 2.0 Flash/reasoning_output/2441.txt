PROBLEM 2441 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 3 = 110 and m \angle 12 = 55. Find the measure of \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three lines DB, JL and AH intersected by two transversals CK and FG.
- Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, and L are labeled.
- Angles 1 to 16 are labeled.
- m \angle 3 = 110 and m \angle 12 = 55 are given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- DB is parallel to JL.
- Angles 3 and 12 are alternate interior angles.
- Angle 1 is an exterior angle with respect to the intersection of line DB and line CK.
- Angles 3 and 7 are vertical angles.
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 3 = 110
- m \angle 12 = 55

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find m \angle 1.
- We can find m \angle 7 = m \angle 3 = 110.
- Since DB is parallel to JL, we have m \angle 8 + m \angle 12 = 180, which is 180-55 = 125.
- m \angle 7 + m \angle 8 = 180 (supplementary) so m \angle 8 = 180 - 110 = 70
- Also m \angle 3 + m \angle 4 = 180 (supplementary) so m \angle 4 = 180 - 110 = 70
- m \angle 1 + m \angle 6 = 180
- m \angle 5 + m \angle 6 = 180
- m \angle 5 = m \angle 3 = 110
- m \angle 6 = 180 - 110 = 70
- m \angle 1 = m \angle 3 and m \angle 1 = m \angle 4
- Angle 1 and 3 are corresponding angles and given that the lines DB and JL are not parallel then the angles are not equal
- There are no corresponding/alternate angles to find m \angle 1
- m \angle 1 + m \angle 2 = 180
- m \angle 12 + m \angle 16 = 180

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines and angles
- Represent the given measurements
- Represent the supplementary angles
- Represent parallel lines
- Need to use information on angles to solve for m \angle 1
