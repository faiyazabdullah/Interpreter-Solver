PROBLEM 2953 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 3.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Point D lies on line AC.
- I can see a triangle ABD with vertices labeled A, B, D
- I can see a triangle BCD with vertices labeled B, C, D
- Angle BAC is marked as 40 degrees.
- Angle ACB is marked as 70 degrees.
- Angle ABD is marked as 45 degrees.
- Angle CBD is marked as 2.
- Angle ADB is marked as 3.
- Angle BDC is marked as 1.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- The sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees.
- The sum of angles in triangle ABD is 180 degrees.
- The sum of angles in triangle BCD is 180 degrees.
- Angle 1 and angle 3 form a linear pair (they are supplementary).

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle BAC = 40 degrees
- Measure of angle ACB = 70 degrees
- Measure of angle ABD = 45 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 3 (ADB).
- We can find the measure of angle ABC.
- Measure of angle ABC = angle ABD + angle CBD.
- We can find the measure of angle ABC = 180 - 40 - 70 = 70 degrees.
- Therefore, angle CBD = angle ABC - angle ABD = 70 - 45 = 25 degrees.
- Then, since sum of angles in triangle BCD is 180 degrees, angle 1 = 180 - 70 - 25 = 85 degrees.
- Since angle 1 and angle 3 are supplementary, angle 3 = 180 - angle 1 = 180 - 85 = 95 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to represent the points, lines, angles, and triangles.
- We need to represent the given angle measurements.
- We need to represent the relationship that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- We need to represent the relationship that angles 1 and 3 are supplementary.
