PROBLEM 2553 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 11 = 62 and m \angle 14 = 38. Find the measure of \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two parallel lines NO and MH.
- I can see two intersecting lines IG and FH, intersecting NO at point C and MH at points K and B respectively.
- I can see different angles labeled from 1 to 14 around the intersection points.
- m \angle 11 = 62 and m \angle 14 = 38 are given.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- NO and MH are parallel lines.
- IG and FH are transversals.
- Angles 11 and 7 are vertical angles, therefore congruent.
- Angles 14 and 10 are vertical angles, therefore congruent.
- Angles 4 and 8 are alternate interior angles, therefore congruent.
- Angles 6 and 10 are alternate interior angles, therefore congruent.
- Angles 1 and 5 are vertical angles, therefore congruent.
- Angles 3 and 6 are alternate interior angles, therefore congruent.
- Angles 1 and 4, 2 and 3 are supplementary angles.
- Sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle 11 = 62 degrees.
- Measure of angle 14 = 38 degrees.
- This means measure of angle 7 = 62 degrees because they are vertical angles.
- This means measure of angle 10 = 38 degrees because they are vertical angles.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for measure of angle 1.
- Since NO and MH are parallel, and IG and FH are transversals, angles 5 and 9 have the same measure.
- Sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees: m \angle 5 + m \angle 9 + m \angle 10 = 180.
- This relationship can be used to find angle 5.
- Then we know that measure of angle 1 = measure of angle 5 because they are vertical angles.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent points, lines, angles, triangles.
- Represent parallel lines NO and MH.
- Represent angles 11 and 14 with measures 62 and 38, respectively.
- Represent vertical angle relationships, and the sum of angles in triangle relationship.
