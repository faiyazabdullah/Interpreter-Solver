PROBLEM 2476 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use parallelogram M N P R to find m \angle R M N.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a parallelogram MNPR with vertices labeled M, N, P, and R.
- Point Q is the intersection of diagonals MP and NR.
- The lengths of sides are given as MN = 3x-4, RP = 20, MR = 17.9, and NP = 2y+5.
- The lengths of line segments are given as NQ = 15.4, RQ = 11.1, MQ = 4w-3, and QP = 3z-3.
- Angle NMP is labeled with 38 degrees, angle MNP is labeled with 33 degrees and angle MQR is labeled with 83 degrees

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- MNPR is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel and congruent: MN || RP, MR || NP, MN = RP, MR = NP.
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, so MQ = QP and NQ = QR.
- Opposite angles are congruent: angle NMR = angle NPR, angle MNP = angle MRP.
- Consecutive angles are supplementary: angle NMR + angle RMN = 180, angle RMN + angle MNP = 180, etc.
- Triangle MNR is a triangle

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(MN) = 3x - 4
- LengthOf(RP) = 20
- LengthOf(MR) = 17.9
- LengthOf(NP) = 2y + 5
- LengthOf(NQ) = 15.4
- LengthOf(RQ) = 11.1
- LengthOf(MQ) = 4w - 3
- LengthOf(QP) = 3z - 3
- MeasureOf(angle NMR) = 38
- MeasureOf(angle MNP) = 33
- MeasureOf(angle MQR) = 83

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle RMN.
- Using properties of parallelogram, angle RMN + angle NMR = 180 and angle RMN + angle MNP = 180. Since we are given the value of MNP as 33, the answer is easily derived using this equation

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all shapes: Parallelogram, points, lines, and angles.
- Define all given measurements with Equals.
- Define properties of Parallelogram: Opposite sides parallel and congruent, diagonals bisect each other.
- Define relationship between consecutive angles of parallelogram
