PROBLEM 2629 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 9 = 75. Find the measure of \angle 6.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see three lines l, m, and n.
- I can see a transversal line t.
- The lines l, m, and n are parallel.
- There are angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12.
- Point B is the intersection of lines l and t.
- Point F is the intersection of lines m and t.
- Point J is the intersection of lines n and t.
- I am given that measure of angle 9 is 75 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since lines l, m, and n are parallel and intersected by transversal t, the corresponding angles are equal.
- Angle 6 and angle 10 are corresponding angles, so m \angle 6 = m \angle 10.
- Angle 9 and angle 10 are supplementary, so m \angle 9 + m \angle 10 = 180 degrees.
- Angle 5 and angle 6 are supplementary, so m \angle 5 + m \angle 6 = 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 9 = 75 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 6.
- I know that angle 9 and angle 10 are supplementary, so I can find the measure of angle 10.
- I also know that angle 6 and angle 10 are equal, so the measure of angle 6 is equal to the measure of angle 10.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallel lines, the transversal, the angles and their relationships.
- Represent that angle 9 is 75 degrees.
- Represent that angles 9 and 10 are supplementary.
- Represent that angles 6 and 10 are corresponding angles.
