PROBLEM 2561 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the figure. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure is composed of a square and two congruent right triangles.
- The square is labeled as BCDE.
- The vertices are labeled as A, B, C, D, and E.
- Measurements are given as follows: BC = CD = DE = BE = 6 m, AC = BC = 4 m, and AD = 5 m.
- Angle ABC is a right angle, as well as angles at vertices B, E, and D in the square.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with AB = BC = 4 m.
- BCDE is a square.
- Triangle ABC and triangle CDE are congruent.
- AD = AE since the two triangles are congruent and share a side.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 6 m
- AC = 4 m
- AB = 4 m (given in diagram)
- AD = 5 m (given in diagram)
- Angle ABC is 90 degrees.
- BCDE is a square, so all its angles are 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the figure.
- The area of the figure is equal to the area of the square plus the area of the triangle ABC.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- We need to define the square BCDE and the triangle ABC, and specify the measures of their sides.
- We also need to express the area of the total shape in terms of the area of the square and triangle.
