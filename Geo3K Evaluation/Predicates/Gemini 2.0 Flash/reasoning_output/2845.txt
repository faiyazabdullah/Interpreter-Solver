PROBLEM 2845 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 58, m \angle 2 = 47, and m \angle 3 = 26. Find the measure of \angle 9.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
- There are line segments AB, BE, BC, EC, CD, EA.
- Angles are labeled with numbers 1 through 9.
- Arrows indicate that AB is parallel to EC.
- Measurements are given for angle 1 (58), angle 2 (47), and angle 3 (26).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AB is parallel to EC.
- Angles 1 and 6 are alternate interior angles and are therefore equal.
- Angles 2 and 5 are alternate interior angles and are therefore equal.
- The sum of the angles in triangle BCE equals 180 degrees.
- The sum of the angles in triangle CDE equals 180 degrees.
- Angles 7 and 8 form a straight line with angle 6, so 7 + 6 + 8 = 180.
- Angles 8 and 4 are vertical angles, so angle 8 = angle 4.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 58
- m \angle 2 = 47
- m \angle 3 = 26

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 9.
- We need to find the relationships between the angles to calculate angle 9.
- Angle 7 and angle 8 and angle 6 form a straight angle.
- The sum of the angles in triangle CDE is 180.
- We can find angle 6 using the parallel lines and then we can figure out what angle 5 is.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, line segments, and angles.
- State that AB is parallel to EC.
- Represent the measures of the given angles.
- Use the properties of parallel lines to relate angles.
- Represent relationships between angles in the triangles.
