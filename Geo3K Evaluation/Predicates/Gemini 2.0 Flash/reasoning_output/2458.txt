PROBLEM 2458 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle C F D on \odot F with diameter A C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center F.
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on the circle.
- Lines AC and BD are chords of the circle, and intersect at F.
- Angle AFB is given as 72 degrees.
- Angle AFD is given as (4a-1) degrees.
- Angle ADF is given as (2a-5) degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Angle AFC and angle AFD form a linear pair.
- Vertical angles are congruent, therefore angle CFD = angle AFB.
- The sum of angles in triangle ADF is 180 degrees.
- Angle AFC and AFB are supplementary angles.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle AFB is 72 degrees.
- Measure of angle AFD is (4a-1) degrees.
- Measure of angle ADF is (2a-5) degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the measure of angle CFD.
- Angle CFD is equal to angle AFB.
- Since angle AFB is 72 degrees, then angle CFD must be 72 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to define points, lines, angles, and the circle.
- Need to define relationships between angles such as supplementary angles.
- Need to specify degree measures.
