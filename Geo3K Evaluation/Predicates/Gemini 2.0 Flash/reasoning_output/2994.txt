PROBLEM 2994 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center A.
- I can see points B, C, D, E, and H lying on lines or tangent to the circle.
- Line BC is tangent to the circle at point D.
- Line CH is tangent to the circle at point H.
- Line BE is a secant to the circle, intersecting the circle at point E.
- AD is a radius of the circle.
- AE is a radius of the circle.
- AB has a length of 41.
- BD has a length of 39.
- CD has a length of 72-3x.
- CH has a length of 5x-8.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AD is perpendicular to BC since BC is tangent to the circle at D.
- AH is a radius of the circle.
- CH = CD because tangents from a point to a circle are equal.
- AE = AD because they are radii of the same circle.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- CH = 5x - 8
- CD = 72 - 3x
- BD = 39
- AB = 41
- Let AD = y, then AE = y.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the value of x.
- We can set up an equation using the fact that CH = CD.
- 5x - 8 = 72 - 3x

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent all points, lines, circles, tangency, and equality relationships in predicates.
- Use the equation 5x - 8 = 72 - 3x to find x.
