PROBLEM 2679 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diagram shows the layout of Elm, Plum, and Oak streets. Find the value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.
- I can see lines BC, DE, and HA.
- I can see that BC and DE are parallel based on the arrows.
- I can see that HA is a transversal.
- Angle BGA is labeled as 55 degrees.
- Angle AFE is labeled as x degrees.
- Elm street is along line BC.
- Plum street is along line DE.
- Oak street is along line HA.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Lines BC and DE are parallel.
- Line HA is a transversal intersecting parallel lines BC and DE.
- Angle BGA and angle AFE are corresponding angles.
- Corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines are congruent.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle BGA is 55 degrees.
- Measure of angle AFE is x degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- Since corresponding angles are congruent, x should be equal to the measure of angle BGA.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define all the points and lines.
- I need to state that lines BC and DE are parallel.
- I need to state that line HA is a transversal.
- I need to define the angles BGA and AFE and their measurements.
- I need to state the relationship that corresponding angles are congruent.
