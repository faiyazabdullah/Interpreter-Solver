PROBLEM 2684 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the variable of x to the nearest tenth. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- There is a triangle ABC, where the line segment AC intersects the circle at point E.
- The line segment AF is tangent to the circle at point F.
- The length of line segment AE is labeled as x.
- The length of line segment EC is labeled as 3x + 5.
- The length of line segment AF is labeled as sqrt(174).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line segment AF is tangent to the circle at point F. Therefore, AF^2 = AE * AC.
- AC = AE + EC

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AE = x
- EC = 3x + 5
- AF = sqrt(174)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question is to find the value of x.
- We can use the tangent-secant power theorem: AF^2 = AE * AC

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all the points, lines and shapes.
- Define all the measurements given.
- Establish the tangent relationship.
- Establish the secant relationship.
- Relate all the measurements together using the tangent-secant power theorem.
