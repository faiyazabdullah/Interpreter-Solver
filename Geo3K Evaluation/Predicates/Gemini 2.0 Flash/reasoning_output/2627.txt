PROBLEM 2627 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- Points R, S, and T lie on the circle.
- Line RT is a diameter of the circle.
- Triangle RST is inscribed in the circle.
- Angle SRT is marked as x degrees.
- Angle RTS is marked as 2x degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- RT is a diameter, so angle RST is a right angle (90 degrees) because it is subtended by a diameter.
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle SRT = x
- Angle RTS = 2x
- Angle RST = 90

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x.
- This can be solved using the fact that the sum of the angles in triangle RST is 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the circle, the points, the triangle, the angles, the diameter and the right angle.
