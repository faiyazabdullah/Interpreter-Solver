PROBLEM 2444 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a triangle ABC.
- I can identify a point D on line AC, forming a right triangle BDA.
- Triangle BDA is a right triangle because angle BDA is marked as a right angle.
- Line segment CD is congruent to line segment DA.
- Angle at vertex B is labeled x degrees.
- Angle at vertex C is labeled y degrees.
- The length of line segment BC is 40.
- The length of line segment BD is 22.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle BDA is a right triangle.
- Since CD is congruent to DA, point A is the midpoint of line segment CD.
- Therefore, LengthOf(CD) = LengthOf(DA), and LengthOf(CA) = 2 * LengthOf(DA).
- Triangle BDC is a larger triangle.
- Angle BDA is a right angle, so line BD is perpendicular to line CD.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = 40
- BD = 22
- We want to find the value of x.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We need to find the measure of angle x in right triangle BDA.
- We can use trigonometric ratios in the right triangle BDC to find angle C (y degrees). Then since we know CD = DA we know the triangle ABD is isosceles and thus angle x = angle BAD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define all points, lines, and triangles.
- Specify the right angle.
- Specify the given lengths.
- Specify the angle variables.
- Define the congruent line segments.
- Express the relationships between the line segments.
