PROBLEM 2917 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find T Q.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a geometric figure containing points R, S, T, Q, A.
- There are lines RS, ST, RQ, TQ.
- RST forms a straight line with lengths RS = 7, ST = 7.
- SQ is perpendicular to RT, indicated by the right angle symbol.
- The length of RQ is x + 3.
- The length of TQ is 2x - 6.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since SQ is perpendicular to RT, angles RSQ and TSQ are right angles.
- Triangle RSQ and Triangle TSQ are right triangles.
- If RQ = TQ, then triangles RSQ and TSQ are congruent by Side-Angle-Side (SAS).
- Given RQ = x + 3 and TQ = 2x - 6, we can set these equal to find x.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- RS = 7
- ST = 7
- RQ = x + 3
- TQ = 2x - 6
- Angle RSQ = 90 degrees
- Angle TSQ = 90 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for TQ which is represented by 2x - 6.
- To solve this, we will equate RQ and TQ.
- Solve for x, and substitute it into the expression for TQ.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, angles, and measurements.
- Use the perpendicular relationship to define right angles.
- Define the given lengths using Equals.
- Use equation RQ = TQ, therefore x+3 = 2x-6.
- Create predicates to represent these relationships.
