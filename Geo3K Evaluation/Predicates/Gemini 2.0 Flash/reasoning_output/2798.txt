PROBLEM 2798 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the area of the shaded region. Assume that the polygon is regular unless otherwise stated. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle DBE with vertices labeled D, B, and E.
- A circle is inscribed in triangle DBE.
- The center of the circle is labeled A.
- The points where the circle touches the triangle are labeled G, C, and F.
- Line segment DG is tangent to the circle at G, line segment BC is tangent to the circle at C, and line segment EF is tangent to the circle at F.
- The length of line segment BG is labeled as 84.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle DBE circumscribes the circle A.
- The circle A is inscribed in the triangle DBE.
- The segments AG, AC, and AF are radii of the circle and are congruent.
- The lines DG, BE, and EF are tangent to the circle.
- Tangents from a common point to a circle are congruent, so DG = GF, GC = CB, and BF = FE.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BG = 84

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the shaded region which is the area of the triangle minus the area of the circle.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle and the inscribed circle.
- Represent the tangent relationships.
- Represent the given length.
