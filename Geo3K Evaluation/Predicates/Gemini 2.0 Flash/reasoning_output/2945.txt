PROBLEM 2945 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find m \angle H.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center B.
- There are points G, J, K, and F on the circumference of the circle.
- There is a point H outside the circle.
- There are lines HA and HC which are secants to the circle.
- Angle H is labeled as 26 degrees, arc KF is labeled as 88 degrees.
- Angle GJK is labeled as 26 degrees.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- GJ and FA are secants intersecting at H outside the circle.
- The measure of angle H is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.
- Arc GJ subtends angle GJK at K

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle H = 26 degrees
- m Arc KF = 88 degrees
- m \angle GJK = 26 degrees

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle H.
- The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc.
- The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside a circle is equal to one-half the positive difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs.
m \angle H = (1/2) * (m Arc KF - m Arc GJ)

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the circle, points, secants, angles, and intercepted arcs.
- Need to use the formula for the measure of the angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle.
