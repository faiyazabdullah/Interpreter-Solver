PROBLEM 2556 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x. Assume that segments that appear to be tangent are tangent.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle with center C.
- I see two lines AB which is tangent to the circle at point E, and AC which is tangent to the circle at point F, and BC which is tangent to the circle at point D.
- I see lengths AF = x, AE = 8, BD = 8, CD = 6, CF = 6.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- AC and BC are tangent to the circle.
- Since AC and AB are tangent to the circle from point A, then AE = AF = 8.
- Since BC and AB are tangent to the circle from point B, then BD = BE = 8.
- CF and CD are radii of the circle so CF = CD = 6.
- Triangle ABC is formed by the three lines.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AF = x
- AE = 8
- BE = 8
- BD = 8
- CD = 6
- CF = 6

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- Find x.
- Since AE = 8 and AE = AF, and AF = x, then x = 8.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, and measurements in the diagram.
- Use Tangent relationships to define the circle and tangent lines.
- Represent tangent segment equality relationships.
