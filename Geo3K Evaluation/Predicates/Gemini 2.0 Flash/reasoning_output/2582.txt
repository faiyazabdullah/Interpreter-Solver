PROBLEM 2582 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find P N.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two triangles, MLP and MNP.
- There are two angles labeled 25 degrees at point M.
- There is a line segment PC with length 3x + 6.
- There is a line segment PN with length 4x - 2.
- There are right angle symbols at points L and N.
- Lines LA and NB are present.
- The points are labeled as L, M, N, P, A, B, C.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- MP bisects the angle LMN.
- ML is perpendicular to LA at point L.
- MN is perpendicular to NB at point N.
- Triangle MLP and MNP share side MP.
- Angle LMP is congruent to angle NMP, each being 25 degrees.
- Angle MLP and MNP are both right angles.
- Therefore triangle MLP and triangle MNP are congruent by AAS.
- Consequently, PL = PN

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Angle LMP = Angle NMP = 25 degrees
- Angle MLP = Angle MNP = 90 degrees
- Length of PL = 3x + 6
- Length of PN = 4x - 2

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the length of PN.
- Since triangle MLP is congruent to triangle MNP, PL = PN.
- Therefore, we can equate the length of PL and PN: 3x + 6 = 4x - 2.
- Solve for x.
- Then plug x into the expression 4x - 2 to find PN.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the points, lines, triangles, and angles.
- Represent the congruent angles.
- Represent the perpendicular lines.
- Represent the lengths of the line segments PL and PN.
- State PL = PN.
