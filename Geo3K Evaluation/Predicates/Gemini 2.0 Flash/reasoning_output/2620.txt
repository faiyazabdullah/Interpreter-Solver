PROBLEM 2620 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- Side AB is marked as 15 units.
- Angle ACB is marked as 60 degrees.
- Side AC is labeled as x.
- Side BC is labeled as y.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex A.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with a right angle at A.
- Sides AB and AC are perpendicular.
- Side BC is the hypotenuse.
- The angle at vertex C is 60 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AB = 15 units (given).
- Angle ACB = 60 degrees (given).
- AC = x (variable to find).
- BC = y.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is the length of side AC.
- This requires using trigonometric ratios (specifically tangent of angle C) since we have the opposite side (AB) and want to find the adjacent side (AC).

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, given measurements, and trigonometric relationships.
