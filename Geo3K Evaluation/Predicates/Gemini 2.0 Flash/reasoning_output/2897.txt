PROBLEM 2897 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x in the given parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral JKLM.
- Angles at vertices J, M, and L are labeled as 75°, 105°, and (2x-1)° respectively.
- The figure is presented as a parallelogram.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since JKLM is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary.
- Therefore, Angle K = Angle M = 105°, and Angle J = Angle L = 75°.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle J = 75°
- Measure of angle M = 105°
- Measure of angle L = (2x-1)°

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- We are asked to find the value of x.
- We know that opposite angles in a parallelogram are congruent and consecutive angles are supplementary.
- Hence, Angle J = Angle L.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the parallelogram JKLM.
- Represent the angles at each vertex.
- State the given angle measurements.
- Express the equality of angles J and L.
