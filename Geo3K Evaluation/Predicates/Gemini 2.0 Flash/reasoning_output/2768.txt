PROBLEM 2768 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60. Find the measure of \angle 4.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see several points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, W.
- I can see several lines such as Line(B,W), Line(A,D), Line(F,Q)
- I can see several angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- I am given that m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60.
- Line(B,W) is parallel to Line(A,D).

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line(B,W) is parallel to Line(A,D), and Line(J,K) and Line(M,N) are transversals intersecting them.
- Angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary angles.
- Angle 3 and angle 7 are supplementary angles.
- Angle 4, angle 5, and angle 6 form a straight angle.
- Angles 1 and angle 3 are given.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m \angle 1 = 50
- m \angle 3 = 60
- Since line(B,W) is parallel to Line(A,D), angle 1 = angle 3. This contradicts the given measurements of m \angle 1 = 50 and m \angle 3 = 60.
- \angle 4 is the required angle whose measure needs to be calculated.
- The lines B,W and A,D are parallel.
- Line passing through F,C,I and Line passing through G,N,L intersect the parallel lines.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 4.
- Need to identify angle relationships based on parallel lines and transversals

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, lines, angles and their relationships.
- Include numerical attributes.
- Include parallel lines.
- The image shows that Angle 5 + Angle 6 = 180 - Angle 4. Since line BW and AD are parallel.
- angle 6 is also equal to angle 1 which is given.
- angle 5 is also equal to angle 3 which is given.
- Therefore, Angle 4 is given by: 180 - angle1 - angle 3.
