PROBLEM 2669 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify points A, B, C, D, E, F
- I can identify lines DC and AE
- I can identify an angle labeled x
- I can identify a right angle between lines DC and AE

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Line DC is perpendicular to line AE, forming a right angle.
- Angle x and the right angle are adjacent angles, forming a straight line.
- Therefore, the sum of angle x and the right angle is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle indicated, which is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of x, which is an angle.
- Since DC is a straight line, the sum of x and 90 degrees must be 180 degrees.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to define the points and lines.
- I need to define the angle and the right angle.
- I need to establish the relationship that the angles add up to 180 degrees.
