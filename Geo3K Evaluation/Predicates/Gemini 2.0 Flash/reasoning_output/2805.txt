PROBLEM 2805 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot O, E C and A B are diameters, and \angle B O D \cong \angle D O E \cong \angle E O F \cong \angle F O A. Find m \widehat A E.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a circle with center O.
- There are several points on the circle: A, B, C, D, E, F.
- There are line segments connecting the center O to each of these points, forming radii: OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF.
- Diameters EC and AB are shown.
- There are four congruent angles at the center: ∠BOD, ∠DOE, ∠EOF, ∠FOA.
- There is a right angle symbol between OC and OA.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF are radii of circle O, therefore they are congruent.
- EC and AB are diameters, so they pass through the center O.
- Because EC and AB are diameters of the circle, angles AOC, BOC, AOE, and COE are straight angles (180 degrees).
- Angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA are congruent.
- Angle AOC is a right angle (90 degrees) because of the right angle symbol.
- Because angle AOC is a right angle, angle BOC must be 90 degrees (since angle AOB is a diameter).
- Arc BC is therefore 90 degrees.
- The four angles BOD, DOE, EOF, and FOA partition the remaining 270 degrees of the circle's arc.
- Since the four angles are congruent, they are each 270/4 = 67.5 degrees.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- m∠AOC = 90 degrees (given by right angle symbol)
- m∠BOD ≅ m∠DOE ≅ m∠EOF ≅ m∠FOA.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of arc AE.
- Arc AE is formed by angles AOE = AOF + FOE. We know AOF and FOE are congruent to angle BOD.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent all points, circle, line segments, angles.
- Represent congruence of the angles.
- Represent that OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, and OF are radii of the circle.
- Represent the fact that AB and EC are diameters.
- Express AOC as a right angle.
