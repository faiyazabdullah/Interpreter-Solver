PROBLEM 2595 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diameter of \odot S is 30 units, the diameter of \odot R is 20 units, and D S = 9 units. Find R C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two circles, \odot S and \odot R.
- I can see points R, C, D, S, and B.
- I can see that points R, C, D, S, and B are collinear.
- D S is given as 9 units.
- The diameter of \odot S is given as 30 units.
- The diameter of \odot R is given as 20 units.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Since the points are collinear, lines can be defined between them.
- The diameters of the circles are given.
- I can infer relationships between the radii and diameters.
- Point R is the center of \odot R.
- Point S is the center of \odot S.
- RC is the radius of \odot R.
- SB is the radius of \odot S.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- DiameterOf(\odot S) = 30
- DiameterOf(\odot R) = 20
- DS = 9

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the value of RC.
- RC is the radius of \odot R.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need predicates to represent the points, circles, diameters, collinearity, and the distances.
- I need to define the circles and identify their centers.
- Establish that RC is a radius.
