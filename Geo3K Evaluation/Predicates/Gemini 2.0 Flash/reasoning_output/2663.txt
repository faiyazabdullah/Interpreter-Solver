PROBLEM 2663 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Trapezoid G H J K has an area of 188.35 square feet. If H J is 16.5 feet, find G K.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can identify a trapezoid G H J K.
- Point I is on line G K, and line H I is perpendicular to line G K.
- The length of line H J is 16.5 ft.
- The length of line H I is 8.7 ft.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex I.
- The area of trapezoid G H J K is 188.35 square feet.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Quadrilateral G H J K is a trapezoid.
- H J is parallel to G K.
- H I is perpendicular to G K.
- H I represents the height of the trapezoid.
- G K represents one of the bases of the trapezoid.
- H J represents the other base of the trapezoid.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of H J = 16.5 ft
- Length of H I = 8.7 ft
- Area of trapezoid G H J K = 188.35 sq ft

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of G K.
- Area of a trapezoid is given by (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2).
- We are given the area, the height, and one of the bases.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define trapezoid G H J K.
- Define points G, H, J, K, and I.
- Define lines G H, H J, J K, K G, G K, and H I.
- Define perpendicularity between H I and G K.
- Represent the given measurements: area of trapezoid, length of H J, and length of H I.
- Use the area formula for a trapezoid: Area = (1/2) * height * (base1 + base2)
