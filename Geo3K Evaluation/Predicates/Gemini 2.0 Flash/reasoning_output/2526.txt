PROBLEM 2526 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the measure of \angle 2 if A B \perp B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see points A, B, C, D, E, F.
- I can see line segments AB, BC, DC, CE, EF.
- I can see angles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
- I see that angle 5 is a right angle.
- I see the measure of angle D is 36 degrees.
- I see that angle 1 has measure 104 degrees.
- I see that angle E has measure 40 degrees.
- I am given that AB is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points D, I, E, C are collinear
- Angle 5 is a right angle, so AB is perpendicular to BC.
- Angles 1 and 3 are supplementary.
- Angles 7 and 40 form a linear pair and are supplementary.
- Angles 7 and 8 are supplementary.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Measure of angle D is 36 degrees.
- Measure of angle 1 is 104 degrees.
- Measure of angle FEC is 40 degrees.
- Since AB is perpendicular to BC, angle 5 is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the measure of angle 2.
- We know that the sum of the angles in triangle DAB is 180 degrees.
- We know that the measure of angle D is 36 degrees.
- We can determine the measure of angle 3 since it is supplementary to angle 1.
- Therefore, angle 3 = 180 - 104 = 76 degrees.
- We know angle 5 is a right angle.
- Angle 3 and angle 5 and angle 6 add up to 180 degrees.
- So angle 6 is 180 - 90 -76 = 14 degrees.
- Therefore the angle ABC is a right angle and the lines are perpendicular.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- I need to represent the points, lines, angles, given angle measurements, and perpendicularity.
- I need to represent the supplementary relationship between angles 1 and 3.
- I need to represent the angles in triangle DAB.
