PROBLEM 2618 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side BC is labeled as x
- Side AC is marked as 4 units
- Side AB is marked as 16 units
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- BC = x units
- AC = 4 units (given)
- AB = 16 units (given)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of x
- This requires using the Pythagorean theorem
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include Pythagorean relationship for solving
