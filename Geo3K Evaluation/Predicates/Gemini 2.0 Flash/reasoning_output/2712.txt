PROBLEM 2712 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If D B = 24, A E = 3, and E C = 18, find A D.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Point D lies on line segment AB.
- Point E lies on line segment AC.
- DB = 24
- AE = 3
- EC = 18

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Points A, D, and B are collinear.
- Points A, E, and C are collinear.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- Length of DB is 24.
- Length of AE is 3.
- Length of EC is 18.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of AD.
- We need to find AD using the given information.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Represent the triangle, points, lines, and given measurements.
