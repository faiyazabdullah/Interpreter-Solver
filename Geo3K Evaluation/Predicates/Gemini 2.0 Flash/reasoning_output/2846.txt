PROBLEM 2846 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a right triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C
- Side AC is marked as 24 units
- Side BC is marked as x units
- Side AB is marked as y units
- Angle ABC is marked as 30 degrees
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex C

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular
- Side AB is the hypotenuse

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AC = 24 units (given)
- Angle ABC = 30 degrees (given)
- BC = x units (variable)
- AB = y units (variable)

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the length of y (AB)
- This requires using trigonometric ratios (cosine)
- Need to establish the relationship between the sides and the angle

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Need to represent the triangle, right angle, measurements, and relationships
- Must include trigonometric relationship for solving
