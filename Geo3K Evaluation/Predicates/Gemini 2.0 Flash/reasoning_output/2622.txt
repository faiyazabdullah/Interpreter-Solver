PROBLEM 2622 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For the pair of similar figures, find the area of the green figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see two diamond shapes, one larger and one smaller.
- The larger diamond has vertices labeled A, B, C, and D.
- A dashed line segment connects A and D, and is labeled as 8 yd.
- The area of the larger diamond is labeled as 36 yd^2.
- The smaller diamond has a dashed line segment labeled as 4 yd.
- The two diamonds are similar.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- Both shapes appear to be rhombuses due to their symmetry.
- The diamonds are similar figures.
- The dashed lines are perpendicular bisectors of each other.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- The altitude of the larger rhombus is 8 yd.
- The area of the larger rhombus is 36 yd^2.
- The altitude of the smaller rhombus is 4 yd.

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks for the area of the smaller diamond.
- Knowing the similarity ratio and the area of the larger diamond, we can find the area of the smaller diamond.

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define the shapes and their relationships.
- Record the known measurements.
- Use the similarity to link the two shapes, allowing for area calculation.
