PROBLEM 2549 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: If A E = m - 2, E C = m + 4, A D = 4, and A B = 20, find m.
================================================================================

STEP 1: IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I can see a triangle ABC with vertices labeled A, B, C.
- There are points D and E on sides AB and AC respectively.
- The length of AD is marked as 4.
- The length of AB is marked as 20.
- The length of AE is marked as m - 2.
- The length of EC is marked as m + 4.

STEP 2: RELATIONSHIP IDENTIFICATION
- D lies on AB.
- E lies on AC.
- AD + DB = AB
- AE + EC = AC
- There is no indication that DE and BC are parallel.
- There are no angle measures or right angles to consider.

STEP 3: MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS
- AD = 4
- AB = 20
- AE = m - 2
- EC = m + 4

STEP 4: QUESTION ALIGNMENT
- The question asks to find the value of m.
- AE and EC form the line segment AC.
- AE + EC = AC
- AE = m - 2
- EC = m + 4
- AC = (m - 2) + (m + 4) = 2m + 2
- The lengths AD and AB are given.
- AD = 4
- AB = 20

STEP 5: PREDICATE PLANNING
- Define points, lines, and triangle
- State that points D and E lie on sides AB and AC respectively.
- State the given measurements.
