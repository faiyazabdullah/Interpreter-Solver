QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with double arrows intersects with y-axis at -4 and 4. Its asymptote in dashed orange is $y=(4/5)x$ and $y=-(4/5)x$. There is also a green rectangular tangent to the hyperbola. Find the equation of the hyperbola.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of a hyperbola given the following information:
1. The hyperbola intersects the \( y \)-axis at \( y = -4 \) and \( y = 4 \).
2. The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given as \( y = \frac{4}{5}x \) and \( y = -\frac{4}{5}x \).
3. A green rectangle is tangent to the hyperbola, but this detail does not directly affect the equation of the hyperbola.

#### Step 1: General Form of the Hyperbola
The standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin with vertical transverse axis is:
\[
\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
where:
- \( 2a \) is the length of the transverse axis.
- The vertices are at \( (0, \pm a) \).
- The slopes of the asymptotes are \( \pm \frac{a}{b} \).

From the problem:
- The hyperbola intersects the \( y \)-axis at \( y = -4 \) and \( y = 4 \), so the vertices are at \( (0, -4) \) and \( (0, 4) \). Therefore, \( a = 4 \).
- The slopes of the asymptotes are \( \pm \frac{4}{5} \). Since the slope of the asymptotes is \( \pm \frac{a}{b} \), we have:
  \[
  \frac{a}{b} = \frac{4}{5} \implies \frac{4}{b} = \frac{4}{5} \implies b = 5.
  \]

#### Step 2: Substitute \( a \) and \( b \) into the Equation
Now that we have \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 5 \), we substitute these values into the standard form of the hyperbola:
\[
\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{y^2}{4^2} - \frac{x^2}{5^2} = 1 \implies \frac{y^2}{16} - \frac{x^2}{25} = 1.
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the Asymptotes
The equations of the asymptotes for the hyperbola \( \frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1 \) are given by:
\[
y = \pm \frac{a}{b}x.
\]
Substituting \( a = 4 \) and \( b = 5 \):
\[
y = \pm \frac{4}{5}x,
\]
which matches the given asymptotes.

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The equation of the hyperbola is:
\[
\frac{y^2}{16} - \frac{x^2}{25} = 1.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{y^2}{16} - \frac{x^2}{25} = 1}
\]
