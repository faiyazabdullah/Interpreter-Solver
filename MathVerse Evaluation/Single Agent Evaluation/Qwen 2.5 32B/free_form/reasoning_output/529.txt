### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the midline equation of a trigonometric function. The given information includes:
1. The maximum point of the function is at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2\right)$.
2. The amplitude of the function is $1.8$.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Midline
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that lies halfway between its maximum and minimum values. If the amplitude is $A$, the midline is determined by the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function. Mathematically, if the maximum value is $M_{\text{max}}$ and the minimum value is $M_{\text{min}}$, the midline $y_m$ is given by:
\[
y_m = \frac{M_{\text{max}} + M_{\text{min}}}{2}
\]

#### Step 2: Identifying the Maximum Value
From the problem, the maximum value of the function is $2$. Therefore, $M_{\text{max}} = 2$.

#### Step 3: Using the Amplitude to Find the Minimum Value
The amplitude $A$ is the distance from the midline to either the maximum or minimum value. Since the amplitude is $1.8$, we can express the relationship between the maximum value, the minimum value, and the midline as follows:
\[
M_{\text{max}} = y_m + A \quad \text{and} \quad M_{\text{min}} = y_m - A
\]
Given $M_{\text{max}} = 2$ and $A = 1.8$, we substitute these into the equation for the maximum value:
\[
2 = y_m + 1.8
\]
Solving for $y_m$, we get:
\[
y_m = 2 - 1.8 = 0.2
\]

#### Step 4: Verifying the Midline
The midline $y_m = 0.2$ is consistent with the given amplitude and maximum value. To confirm, we can calculate the minimum value using $M_{\text{min}} = y_m - A$:
\[
M_{\text{min}} = 0.2 - 1.8 = -1.6
\]
This confirms that the midline is indeed $y = 0.2$, as it lies halfway between the maximum value $2$ and the minimum value $-1.6$.

#### Step 5: Writing the Midline Equation
The midline is a horizontal line, so its equation is simply:
\[
y = 0.2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y = 0.2}
\]
