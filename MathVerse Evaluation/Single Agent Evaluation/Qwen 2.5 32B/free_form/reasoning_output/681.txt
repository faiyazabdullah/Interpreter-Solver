QUESTION:
This box is to have a divider placed in as shown. The box has sides of length 19 cm, 10 cm and 7 cm.
Calculate the area of the divider correct to two decimal places, using your rounded answer from the previous part.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves calculating the area of a triangular divider placed inside a rectangular prism. The dimensions of the prism are:
- Length \( AB = 19 \, \text{cm} \)
- Width \( BC = 10 \, \text{cm} \)
- Height \( CD = 7 \, \text{cm} \)

The triangular divider is formed by connecting points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \). This triangle lies within the plane defined by these three points. To calculate the area of this triangle, we need to determine its base and height.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Base and Height of the Triangle
- The base of the triangle \( \triangle ABC \) can be taken as \( AB \), which is given as \( 19 \, \text{cm} \).
- The height of the triangle is the perpendicular distance from point \( C \) to the line segment \( AB \). Since \( C \) is directly above \( B \) at a vertical distance of \( 10 \, \text{cm} \) (the width of the prism), the height of the triangle is \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 2: Use the Formula for the Area of a Triangle
The area \( A \) of a triangle is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here:
- Base \( = AB = 19 \, \text{cm} \)
- Height \( = BC = 10 \, \text{cm} \)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 19 \times 10
\]

#### Step 3: Perform the Calculation
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 19 \times 10 = \frac{1}{2} \times 190 = 95 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Round to Two Decimal Places
The area is already a whole number, so no further rounding is necessary.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{95.00 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
