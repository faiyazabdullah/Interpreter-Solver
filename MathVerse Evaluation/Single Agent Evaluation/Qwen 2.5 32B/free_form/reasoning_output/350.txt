QUESTION:
A fighter jet, flying at an altitude of 2000 m is approaching a target. At a particular time the pilot measures the angle of depression to the target to be 13^\circ . After a minute, the pilot measures the angle of depression again and finds it to be 16^\circ .
Now find the distance covered by the jet in one minute.

Round your answer to the nearest meter.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Extract Information**
- The fighter jet is flying at a constant altitude of \(2000 \, \text{m}\).
- Initially, the angle of depression to the target is \(13^\circ\). This corresponds to the angle \(\angle BAC = 13^\circ\).
- After one minute, the angle of depression changes to \(16^\circ\). This corresponds to the angle \(\angle ABC = 16^\circ\).
- We need to find the horizontal distance covered by the jet in one minute, which is the length \(AB\).

#### **Step 2: Define Variables and Set Up the Geometry**
Let:
- \(C\) be the target on the ground.
- \(A\) be the initial position of the jet.
- \(B\) be the position of the jet after one minute.
- The vertical distance from the jet to the ground is \(2000 \, \text{m}\), so \(AC\) and \(BC\) are the hypotenuses of right triangles formed with the ground.

From the geometry:
- In \(\triangle ABC\):
  - \(\angle BAC = 13^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ABC = 16^\circ\)
  - \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\) (since the ground is horizontal).

#### **Step 3: Use Trigonometry to Find Distances**
We need to find the horizontal distances \(AC\) and \(BC\) using the tangent function, which relates the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle.

##### **Calculate \(AC\):**
In \(\triangle ACD\) (where \(D\) is the point directly below \(A\) on the ground):
\[
\tan(13^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{2000}{AC}
\]
\[
AC = \frac{2000}{\tan(13^\circ)}
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
\tan(13^\circ) \approx 0.230868
\]
\[
AC = \frac{2000}{0.230868} \approx 8664.46 \, \text{m}
\]

##### **Calculate \(BC\):**
In \(\triangle BCD\) (where \(D\) is the point directly below \(B\) on the ground):
\[
\tan(16^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{2000}{BC}
\]
\[
BC = \frac{2000}{\tan(16^\circ)}
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
\tan(16^\circ) \approx 0.286745
\]
\[
BC = \frac{2000}{0.286745} \approx 7000.00 \, \text{m}
\]

#### **Step 4: Find the Horizontal Distance Covered (\(AB\))**
The horizontal distance covered by the jet in one minute is the difference between \(AC\) and \(BC\):
\[
AB = AC - BC
\]
\[
AB = 8664.46 \, \text{m} - 7000.00 \, \text{m} = 1664.46 \, \text{m}
\]

#### **Step 5: Round to the Nearest Meter**
Rounding \(1664.46 \, \text{m}\) to the nearest meter gives:
\[
AB \approx 1664 \, \text{m}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1664}
\]
