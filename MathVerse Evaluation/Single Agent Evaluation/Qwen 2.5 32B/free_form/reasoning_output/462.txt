QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the radius of the circle.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the radius of the circle shown in the image, let's follow the solution steps carefully.

### Step 1: Examine the geometric figure
The image shows a circle centered at a point within the coordinate plane. The circle intersects the axes at four points. The center of the circle appears to be near the origin but is not exactly at the origin. The circle's size and position suggest it is symmetrically placed around its center.

### Step 2: Understand the given information
- The circle intersects the axes at four points, meaning it crosses both the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis.
- The center of the circle is located at \((h, k)\).
- The radius \(r\) of the circle is the distance from the center \((h, k)\) to any point on the circle.

### Step 3: Identify what needs to be found
We need to determine the radius \(r\) of the circle. To do this, we will use the standard equation of a circle:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]
where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \(r\) is the radius.

### Step 4: Determine the center of the circle
From the image, the center of the circle appears to be at approximately \((0, 0)\). However, upon closer inspection, the center is slightly offset. By analyzing the symmetry and the intersections, the center is precisely at \((0, 0)\).

### Step 5: Find the radius
The radius is the distance from the center \((0, 0)\) to any point on the circle. From the image, the circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-5, 0)\) and \((5, 0)\), and the \(y\)-axis at \((0, 5)\) and \((0, -5)\). This indicates that the radius is the distance from the center \((0, 0)\) to any of these points.

Using the distance formula:
\[
r = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
where \((x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (5, 0)\):
\[
r = \sqrt{(5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{5^2} = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

### Step 6: Verify the result
The radius is consistent with the intersections of the circle with the axes. The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-5, 0)\) and \((5, 0)\), and the \(y\)-axis at \((0, 5)\) and \((0, -5)\), confirming that the radius is indeed 5.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
