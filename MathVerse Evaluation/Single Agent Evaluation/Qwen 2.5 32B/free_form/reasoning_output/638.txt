QUESTION:
A triangular divider has been placed into a box, as shown in the diagram. The box has sides of length 12cm, 12cm and 17cm. 

Calculate the area of the triangular divider correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the solution steps systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The box has dimensions:
  - Length \( AB = 17 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Height \( BC = 12 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Depth (not explicitly labeled but implied from the diagram) is also \( 12 \, \text{cm} \).
- The triangular divider forms a right triangle with vertices at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- We need to calculate the area of this triangular divider.

### Step 2: Understand the geometry of the triangle
The triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle because:
- \( AB \) is the base along the length of the box.
- \( BC \) is the height of the box.
- \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the triangle.

### Step 3: Identify what needs to be found
We need to find the area of \( \triangle ABC \). The formula for the area of a right triangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here:
- The base \( AB = 17 \, \text{cm} \)
- The height \( BC = 12 \, \text{cm} \)

### Step 4: Apply the formula
Substitute the values into the area formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times BC = \frac{1}{2} \times 17 \times 12
\]

Perform the multiplication:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 204 = 102 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 5: Verify the result
The calculation is straightforward, and the values are consistent with the given dimensions of the box. The area of the triangular divider is correctly computed.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{102 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
