FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a rectangle with length \( l \) inches and width \( w \) inches. The perimeter of the rectangle is denoted as \( p \), and the area of the rectangle is given as 36 square inches. We are tasked with finding one possible value of \( p \), given that both \( l \) and \( w \) are integers.

#### Step 1: Recall the formulas for the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
- **Perimeter of a rectangle**: 
  \[
  p = 2(l + w)
  \]
- **Area of a rectangle**: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = l \cdot w
  \]
  Here, the area is given as 36, so:
  \[
  l \cdot w = 36
  \]

#### Step 2: List all pairs of integer factors of 36.
Since \( l \) and \( w \) are integers, they must be factor pairs of 36. The factor pairs of 36 are:
\[
(1, 36), (2, 18), (3, 12), (4, 9), (6, 6)
\]
Each pair \((l, w)\) satisfies \( l \cdot w = 36 \).

#### Step 3: Calculate the perimeter for each factor pair.
Using the formula for the perimeter \( p = 2(l + w) \), we calculate \( p \) for each pair:
1. For \((l, w) = (1, 36)\):
   \[
   p = 2(1 + 36) = 2 \cdot 37 = 74
   \]
2. For \((l, w) = (2, 18)\):
   \[
   p = 2(2 + 18) = 2 \cdot 20 = 40
   \]
3. For \((l, w) = (3, 12)\):
   \[
   p = 2(3 + 12) = 2 \cdot 15 = 30
   \]
4. For \((l, w) = (4, 9)\):
   \[
   p = 2(4 + 9) = 2 \cdot 13 = 26
   \]
5. For \((l, w) = (6, 6)\):
   \[
   p = 2(6 + 6) = 2 \cdot 12 = 24
   \]

#### Step 4: Identify one possible value of \( p \).
From the calculations above, the possible values of \( p \) are 74, 40, 30, 26, and 24. Any one of these values is a valid answer.

#### Final Answer:
One possible value of \( p \) is 24.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{24}\]
