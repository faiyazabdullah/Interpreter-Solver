QUESTION:
At a point during the flight, a plane is 42 kilometres south and 57 kilometres west of the airport it left from.


Find the size of the angle marked b to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the angle \( b \) formed by the plane's position relative to the airport. The plane is 42 km south and 57 km west of the airport. This forms a right triangle, where:
- The horizontal distance (westward) is 57 km.
- The vertical distance (southward) is 42 km.
- The angle \( b \) is the angle between the horizontal line (westward direction) and the hypotenuse of the triangle.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Horizontal distance (adjacent side): 57 km
- Vertical distance (opposite side): 42 km
- Angle to find: \( b \)

#### Step 2: Understand the relationship
The angle \( b \) can be determined using trigonometric relationships in a right triangle. Specifically, the tangent function relates the opposite side to the adjacent side:
\[
\tan(b) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
Here:
\[
\tan(b) = \frac{42}{57}
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( b \)
To find \( b \), we take the inverse tangent (arctangent) of the ratio:
\[
b = \arctan\left(\frac{42}{57}\right)
\]

#### Step 4: Perform the calculation
First, compute the ratio:
\[
\frac{42}{57} \approx 0.736842
\]
Next, calculate the arctangent:
\[
b = \arctan(0.736842)
\]
Using a calculator:
\[
b \approx 36.2^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Round to one decimal place
The angle \( b \) rounded to one decimal place is:
\[
b \approx 36.2^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{36.2^\circ}
\]
