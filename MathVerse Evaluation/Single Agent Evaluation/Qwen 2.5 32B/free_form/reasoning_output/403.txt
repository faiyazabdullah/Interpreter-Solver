QUESTION:
The radius of the figure is $ 13 \mathrm{~mm}$. It follows that a two thirds of a circle has area $\frac{2}{3} \pi r^{2}$. Find the exact area of the shape shown, which is two thirds of a circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Identify the Given Information
- The radius \( r \) of the circle is \( 13 \, \text{mm} \).
- The shape shown is a sector of a circle with a central angle of \( 240^\circ \).
- We are tasked with finding the area of this sector, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the full circle.

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- A full circle has a central angle of \( 360^\circ \).
- The sector shown has a central angle of \( 240^\circ \), which is \( \frac{240^\circ}{360^\circ} = \frac{2}{3} \) of the full circle.
- Therefore, the area of the sector is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the area of the full circle.

#### Step 3: Recall the Formula for the Area of a Circle
The area \( A \) of a full circle is given by:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]
where \( r \) is the radius.

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Full Circle
Substitute \( r = 13 \, \text{mm} \) into the formula:
\[
A_{\text{full}} = \pi (13)^2 = \pi \cdot 169 = 169\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Sector
The area of the sector is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the area of the full circle:
\[
A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 169\pi = \frac{338\pi}{3} \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the Solution
- The central angle of \( 240^\circ \) corresponds to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the full circle, so the calculation is consistent.
- The area of the sector is correctly derived as \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the full circle's area.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{338\pi}{3} \, \text{mm}^2}
\]
