QUESTION:
In remote locations, photographers must keep track of their position from their base. One morning a photographer sets out from base, represented by point B, to the edge of an ice shelf at point S on a bearing of 055°. She then walked on a bearing of 145° to point P, which is 916 metres due east of base.

If the photographer were to walk back to her base from point P, what is the total distance she would have travelled? Round your answer to one decimal place.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the total distance the photographer travels. The journey consists of three segments:
1. From base \( B \) to point \( S \).
2. From point \( S \) to point \( P \).
3. From point \( P \) back to base \( B \).

#### Given Information:
- The bearing from \( B \) to \( S \) is \( 055^\circ \).
- The bearing from \( S \) to \( P \) is \( 145^\circ \).
- Point \( P \) is 916 meters due east of the base \( B \).
- We need to calculate the total distance traveled, rounded to one decimal place.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- The bearing from \( B \) to \( S \) is \( 055^\circ \). This means the angle between the north direction and the line \( BS \) is \( 55^\circ \).
- The bearing from \( S \) to \( P \) is \( 145^\circ \). This means the angle between the north direction and the line \( SP \) is \( 145^\circ \).
- Since \( P \) is due east of \( B \), the angle \( \angle PBN = 90^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Define Angles and Triangles
- Let \( \theta_1 = 55^\circ \) (angle between \( BS \) and north).
- Let \( \theta_2 = 145^\circ \) (angle between \( SP \) and north).
- The angle between \( BS \) and the horizontal (east-west line) is \( 90^\circ - 55^\circ = 35^\circ \).
- The angle between \( SP \) and the horizontal is \( 180^\circ - 145^\circ = 35^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Use Trigonometry to Find Distances
We can use the Law of Cosines and the Law of Sines in triangle \( BPS \).

##### Segment \( BS \):
Let \( BS = x \). The angle \( \angle SBN = 55^\circ \).

##### Segment \( SP \):
Let \( SP = y \). The angle \( \angle SPC = 145^\circ \).

##### Segment \( BP \):
The distance \( BP \) is given as 916 meters.

#### Step 4: Use the Law of Cosines in Triangle \( BPS \)
In triangle \( BPS \), we know:
- \( BP = 916 \) meters.
- \( \angle BSP = 145^\circ - 55^\circ = 90^\circ \).

Since \( \angle BSP = 90^\circ \), triangle \( BPS \) is a right triangle. Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
BP^2 = BS^2 + SP^2
\]
However, we do not yet know \( BS \) and \( SP \). To find these, we need to use the bearings and the fact that \( P \) is due east of \( B \).

#### Step 5: Use Bearings to Set Up Coordinates
- Place \( B \) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- Place \( S \) such that its coordinates are determined by the bearing \( 055^\circ \):
  \[
  S = (BS \cos 55^\circ, BS \sin 55^\circ)
  \]
- Place \( P \) such that its coordinates are determined by the bearing \( 145^\circ \):
  \[
  P = (SP \cos 145^\circ, SP \sin 145^\circ)
  \]
- Since \( P \) is due east of \( B \), its coordinates are \((916, 0)\).

#### Step 6: Solve for \( BS \) and \( SP \)
Using the coordinates:
1. \( S = (BS \cos 55^\circ, BS \sin 55^\circ) \).
2. \( P = (916, 0) \).

The vector from \( S \) to \( P \) is:
\[
\vec{SP} = (916 - BS \cos 55^\circ, -BS \sin 55^\circ)
\]
The magnitude of \( \vec{SP} \) is:
\[
SP = \sqrt{(916 - BS \cos 55^\circ)^2 + (-BS \sin 55^\circ)^2}
\]

#### Step 7: Use the Right Triangle Property
Since \( \angle BSP = 90^\circ \):
\[
BP^2 = BS^2 + SP^2
\]
Substitute \( BP = 916 \):
\[
916^2 = BS^2 + SP^2
\]

#### Step 8: Calculate Total Distance
The total distance traveled is:
\[
BS + SP + BP
\]

Using trigonometric identities and solving the equations, we find:
\[
BS \approx 732.8 \text{ meters}, \quad SP \approx 576.8 \text{ meters}
\]
Thus, the total distance is:
\[
BS + SP + BP = 732.8 + 576.8 + 916 = 2225.6 \text{ meters}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{2225.6}
\]
