QUESTION:
The following cylinder has a height of 49 m and a base radius of 21 m.

Find the surface area.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a cylinder with the following dimensions:
- Height (\( h \)) = 49 m
- Base radius (\( r \)) = 21 m

We are tasked with finding the surface area of the cylinder. The surface area of a cylinder consists of three parts:
1. The lateral surface area (the curved surface).
2. The area of the two circular bases.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Formula for Surface Area of a Cylinder
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
A = \text{Lateral Surface Area} + \text{Area of Two Bases}
\]
where:
- **Lateral Surface Area** = \( 2\pi rh \)
- **Area of Two Bases** = \( 2\pi r^2 \)

Thus, the total surface area is:
\[
A = 2\pi rh + 2\pi r^2
\]

#### 2. Substitute the Given Values
From the problem:
- \( r = 21 \) m
- \( h = 49 \) m

First, calculate the lateral surface area:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh = 2\pi (21)(49)
\]
\[
= 2\pi (1029) = 2058\pi
\]

Next, calculate the area of the two bases:
\[
\text{Area of Two Bases} = 2\pi r^2 = 2\pi (21)^2
\]
\[
= 2\pi (441) = 882\pi
\]

#### 3. Total Surface Area
Now, sum the lateral surface area and the area of the two bases:
\[
A = 2058\pi + 882\pi = 2940\pi
\]

#### 4. Approximate the Value
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
A \approx 2940 \times 3.14159 = 9236.2796
\]

Rounding to the nearest two decimal places:
\[
A \approx 9236.28
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{9236.28 \text{ m}^2}
\]
