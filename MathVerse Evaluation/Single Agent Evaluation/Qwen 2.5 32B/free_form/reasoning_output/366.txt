QUESTION:
A ship is 27m away from the bottom of a cliff. A lighthouse is located at the top of the cliff. The ship's distance is 34m from the bottom of the lighthouse and 37m from the top of the lighthouse.
Hence find the height of the lighthouse to the nearest tenth of a metre.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the height of a lighthouse located at the top of a cliff. The problem provides the following information:
- The ship is 27 meters horizontally away from the base of the cliff.
- The ship is 34 meters away from the bottom of the lighthouse (the base of the cliff).
- The ship is 37 meters away from the top of the lighthouse.

We need to determine the height of the lighthouse, denoted as \( y \), to the nearest tenth of a meter.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify the Geometric Setup:**
   - Let the base of the cliff be at point \( A \).
   - Let the bottom of the lighthouse (base of the cliff) be at point \( B \).
   - Let the top of the lighthouse be at point \( C \).
   - The ship is at point \( S \).

   From the problem:
   - \( AS = 27 \) meters (horizontal distance from the ship to the base of the cliff).
   - \( BS = 34 \) meters (distance from the ship to the bottom of the lighthouse).
   - \( CS = 37 \) meters (distance from the ship to the top of the lighthouse).

#### 2. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem for the Triangle \( ABS \):**
   In triangle \( ABS \):
   - \( AB = 27 \) meters (horizontal distance).
   - \( BS = 34 \) meters (hypotenuse).
   - Let \( x \) be the vertical distance from the base of the cliff to the bottom of the lighthouse (i.e., the height of the cliff).

   Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   BS^2 = AB^2 + x^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   34^2 = 27^2 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   1156 = 729 + x^2
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x^2 = 1156 - 729
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 427
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{427}
   \]
   \[
   x \approx 20.66 \text{ meters}
   \]

#### 3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem for the Triangle \( ACS \):**
   In triangle \( ACS \):
   - \( AC = 27 \) meters (horizontal distance).
   - \( CS = 37 \) meters (hypotenuse).
   - Let \( y \) be the vertical distance from the bottom of the lighthouse to the top of the lighthouse (the height of the lighthouse).

   Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   CS^2 = AC^2 + (x + y)^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   37^2 = 27^2 + (x + y)^2
   \]
   \[
   1369 = 729 + (x + y)^2
   \]
   Solving for \( (x + y)^2 \):
   \[
   (x + y)^2 = 1369 - 729
   \]
   \[
   (x + y)^2 = 640
   \]
   \[
   x + y = \sqrt{640}
   \]
   \[
   x + y = \sqrt{640} \approx 25.298
   \]

#### 4. **Solve for \( y \):**
   We already know \( x \approx 20.66 \). Substitute \( x \) into the equation \( x + y = \sqrt{640} \):
   \[
   20.66 + y = 25.298
   \]
   Solving for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 25.298 - 20.66
   \]
   \[
   y \approx 4.638
   \]

#### 5. **Round to the Nearest Tenth:**
   The height of the lighthouse \( y \) is approximately 4.6 meters when rounded to the nearest tenth.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4.6}
\]
