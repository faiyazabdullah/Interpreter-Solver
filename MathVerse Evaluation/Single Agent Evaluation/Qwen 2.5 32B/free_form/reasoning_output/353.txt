QUESTION:
An airplane is currently flying 35^\circ  south of east, as shown in the image.

The control tower orders the plane to change course by turning 7^\circ  to the left. How many degrees south of east is the new course that the plane is ordered to fly?

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves determining the new course of an airplane after it turns 7° to the left from its current course. The current course is given as 35° south of east. We need to calculate how many degrees south of east the new course will be after the turn.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Current Course
- The airplane is currently flying 35° south of east. This means the angle between the east direction and the airplane's course is 35° measured clockwise from east toward south.

#### Step 2: Effect of Turning Left
- When the airplane turns 7° to the left, it moves counterclockwise from its current position. 
- To determine the new course, we subtract 7° from the current angle (since turning left reduces the angle).

#### Step 3: Calculating the New Course
- Current course: 35° south of east.
- Turn left by 7°: Subtract 7° from 35°.
  \[
  35^\circ - 7^\circ = 28^\circ
  \]
- The new course is therefore 28° south of east.

#### Step 4: Verifying the Result
- The new course is still south of east because the airplane has not turned beyond the east direction. The reduction in the angle simply means the airplane is closer to the east direction than before.

### Final Answer:
The new course of the airplane is \(\boxed{28^\circ}\) south of east.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{28^\circ}\]
