====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the equation of an ellipse given its intersections with the coordinate axes. The key points provided are:
- The ellipse intersects the \( x \)-axis at \( x = -0.5 \) and \( x = -3.5 \).
- The ellipse intersects the \( y \)-axis at \( y = 2 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the General Form of an Ellipse
The standard form of an ellipse centered at the origin is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
where:
- \( a \) is the semi-major axis length (half the length of the major axis).
- \( b \) is the semi-minor axis length (half the length of the minor axis).

#### Step 2: Use the Given Intersections
1. **Intersections with the \( x \)-axis**:
   - The points of intersection with the \( x \)-axis are \( (-0.5, 0) \) and \( (-3.5, 0) \).
   - These points lie on the ellipse, so they satisfy the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{0^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{x^2}{a^2} = 1 \implies x = \pm a
     \]
   - Therefore, the semi-major axis length \( a \) is half the distance between \( -0.5 \) and \( -3.5 \):
     \[
     a = \frac{-0.5 - (-3.5)}{2} = \frac{-0.5 + 3.5}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5
     \]

2. **Intersection with the \( y \)-axis**:
   - The point of intersection with the \( y \)-axis is \( (0, 2) \).
   - This point satisfies the equation:
     \[
     \frac{0^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \implies y = \pm b
     \]
   - Therefore, the semi-minor axis length \( b \) is:
     \[
     b = 2
     \]

#### Step 3: Write the Equation of the Ellipse
Now that we have \( a = 1.5 \) and \( b = 2 \), we can substitute these values into the standard form of the ellipse equation:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
Substituting \( a = 1.5 \) and \( b = 2 \):
\[
a^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, \quad b^2 = 2^2 = 4
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x^2}{2.25} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1
\]

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The equation of the ellipse is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{x^2}{2.25} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1}
\]
