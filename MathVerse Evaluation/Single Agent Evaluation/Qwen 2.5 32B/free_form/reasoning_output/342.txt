QUESTION:
Consider the following diagram. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 38° and angle B is 49°.

Find the true bearing of point C from point B.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( B \). The given information includes:
- Triangle \( ABC \) with:
  - \( \angle A = 38^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = 49^\circ \)
- The true bearings of points \( A \) and \( B \) are indicated by the arrows in the diagram.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The true bearing of point \( A \) from the reference direction (north) is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the diagram. The arrow at \( A \) points directly north.
- The true bearing of point \( B \) from the reference direction (north) is also not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the diagram. The arrow at \( B \) points directly east.
- The interior angles of triangle \( ABC \) are:
  - \( \angle A = 38^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = 49^\circ \)

#### Step 2: Determine the third angle in triangle \( ABC \)
Using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
\[
\angle C = 180^\circ - \angle A - \angle B = 180^\circ - 38^\circ - 49^\circ = 93^\circ
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the direction of \( \overrightarrow{BC} \)
From point \( B \), we need to find the direction of \( \overrightarrow{BC} \). The angle \( \angle B \) is given as \( 49^\circ \), which is the angle between \( \overrightarrow{BA} \) and \( \overrightarrow{BC} \). Since \( \overrightarrow{BA} \) points west (opposite to the arrow at \( B \)), the direction of \( \overrightarrow{BC} \) can be determined relative to the north direction.

#### Step 4: Convert the angle to a true bearing
- The true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.
- From the diagram, point \( B \) is facing east, so the angle \( \angle B = 49^\circ \) indicates that \( \overrightarrow{BC} \) is \( 49^\circ \) south of east.
- To convert this to a true bearing:
  - Start from north.
  - Move \( 90^\circ \) east (since \( B \) is facing east).
  - Then move an additional \( 49^\circ \) south of east.
  - This results in a true bearing of:
    \[
    90^\circ + 49^\circ = 139^\circ
    \]

#### Final Answer:
The true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( B \) is \( 139^\circ \).

\[
\boxed{139^\circ}
\]
