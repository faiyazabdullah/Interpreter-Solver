QUESTION:
The logo of a shop consists of five semicircles; four small semicircles each with the same radius, and one large semicircle. The perimeter of the whole shape is 14\pi  units.
The entire shape is to be enlarged by a factor of 5 to form a logo sticker on the window of a shop front. What area of the shop front window will the sticker take up?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the enlarged logo sticker. Let's proceed step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The logo consists of five semicircles: one large semicircle and four smaller semicircles with equal radii.
- The perimeter of the entire shape is given as \( 14\pi \) units.
- The entire shape is to be enlarged by a factor of 5.

We need to find the area of the enlarged logo sticker.

---

### **Step 2: Define variables and express the perimeter**
Let:
- \( R \) be the radius of the large semicircle.
- \( r \) be the radius of each of the four smaller semicircles.

The perimeter of the shape includes:
1. The curved part of the large semicircle: \( \pi R \).
2. The curved parts of the four smaller semicircles: \( 4 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi r = 2\pi r \).

Thus, the total perimeter is:
\[
\pi R + 2\pi r = 14\pi
\]
Dividing through by \( \pi \):
\[
R + 2r = 14 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

---

### **Step 3: Determine the relationship between \( R \) and \( r \)**
From the geometry of the logo, observe that the diameter of the large semicircle is equal to the sum of the diameters of two smaller semicircles. Therefore:
\[
2R = 2r + 2r \implies 2R = 4r \implies R = 2r
\]

Substitute \( R = 2r \) into Equation 1:
\[
2r + 2r = 14 \implies 4r = 14 \implies r = \frac{14}{4} = 3.5
\]

Using \( R = 2r \):
\[
R = 2 \times 3.5 = 7
\]

So, the radius of the large semicircle is \( R = 7 \) units, and the radius of each smaller semicircle is \( r = 3.5 \) units.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the area of the original logo**
The area of the logo consists of:
1. The area of the large semicircle.
2. The areas of the four smaller semicircles.

#### Area of the large semicircle:
The area of a full circle with radius \( R \) is \( \pi R^2 \). Therefore, the area of the large semicircle is:
\[
\text{Area of large semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (7)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 49 = \frac{49\pi}{2}
\]

#### Area of one smaller semicircle:
The area of a full circle with radius \( r \) is \( \pi r^2 \). Therefore, the area of one smaller semicircle is:
\[
\text{Area of one smaller semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (3.5)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 12.25 = \frac{12.25\pi}{2} = 6.125\pi
\]

Since there are four smaller semicircles, their total area is:
\[
\text{Total area of four smaller semicircles} = 4 \times 6.125\pi = 24.5\pi
\]

#### Total area of the logo:
\[
\text{Total area} = \text{Area of large semicircle} + \text{Total area of four smaller semicircles} = \frac{49\pi}{2} + 24.5\pi
\]
Convert \( 24.5\pi \) to a fraction for consistency:
\[
24.5\pi = \frac{49\pi}{2}
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Total area} = \frac{49\pi}{2} + \frac{49\pi}{2} = \frac{98\pi}{2} = 49\pi
\]

---

### **Step 5: Enlarge the logo by a factor of 5**
When a shape is enlarged by a factor of \( k \), its area is multiplied by \( k^2 \). Here, \( k = 5 \), so the area is multiplied by \( 5^2 = 25 \).

The area of the enlarged logo is:
\[
\text{Enlarged area} = 25 \times 49\pi = 1225\pi
\]

---

### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{1225\pi}
\]
