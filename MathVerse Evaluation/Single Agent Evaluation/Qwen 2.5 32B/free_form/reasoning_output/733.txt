### Problem Analysis:
The given figure depicts a prism with a cross-sectional area that appears to be a trapezoid. The problem asks us to find the volume of the prism. To solve this, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The base of the prism has a height of \(14 \, \text{cm}\).
   - The height of the prism is \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
   - The trapezoidal cross-section has two parallel sides (bases) and a height of \(7 \, \text{cm}\).

2. **Understand the geometry:**
   - The trapezoid has two parallel sides: the longer base is \(14 \, \text{cm}\), and the shorter base is \(5 \, \text{cm}\).
   - The height of the trapezoid (distance between the parallel sides) is \(7 \, \text{cm}\).

3. **Find the area of the trapezoid:**
   The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \times \text{Height}
   \]
   Here:
   - \(\text{Base}_1 = 14 \, \text{cm}\)
   - \(\text{Base}_2 = 5 \, \text{cm}\)
   - \(\text{Height} = 7 \, \text{cm}\)

   Substituting these values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (14 + 5) \times 7 = \frac{1}{2} \times 19 \times 7 = \frac{1}{2} \times 133 = 66.5 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

4. **Calculate the volume of the prism:**
   The volume of a prism is given by:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height of the Prism}
   \]
   Here:
   - \(\text{Base Area} = 66.5 \, \text{cm}^2\)
   - \(\text{Height of the Prism} = 3 \, \text{cm}\)

   Substituting these values:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = 66.5 \times 3 = 199.5 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{199.5 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
