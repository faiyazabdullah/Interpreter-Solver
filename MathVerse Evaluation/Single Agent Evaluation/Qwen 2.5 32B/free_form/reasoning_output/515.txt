QUESTION:
The graph shows the amount of water remaining in a bucket that was initially full before a hole was made in its side. What is the slope of the shown function that passes (0, 30)?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The graph shows the relationship between the **quantity of water remaining in a bucket (in litres)** and the **time elapsed (in minutes)** since a hole was made in the bucket. The initial quantity of water is 30 litres at time \( t = 0 \). The graph is a straight line, indicating a linear relationship between the quantity of water and time.

We are tasked with finding the **slope** of this linear function. The slope of a line can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\text{change in quantity}}{\text{change in time}}
\]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Two Points on the Line:**
   From the graph, we can identify two points:
   - At \( t = 0 \), the quantity of water is 30 litres. This gives the point \((0, 30)\).
   - At \( t = 40 \) minutes, the quantity of water is 8 litres. This gives the point \((40, 8)\).

2. **Calculate the Change in Quantity (\(\Delta y\)):**
   The change in quantity is the difference between the quantity at the second point and the first point:
   \[
   \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 8 - 30 = -22 \text{ litres}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Change in Time (\(\Delta x\)):**
   The change in time is the difference between the time at the second point and the first point:
   \[
   \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 40 - 0 = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Compute the Slope:**
   Using the formula for the slope:
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-22}{40} = -\frac{11}{20}
   \]

5. **Interpret the Slope:**
   The negative slope indicates that the quantity of water is decreasing over time, which aligns with the context of water leaking from the bucket. The slope \(-\frac{11}{20}\) means that the quantity of water decreases by \(\frac{11}{20}\) litres per minute.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{11}{20}}
\]
