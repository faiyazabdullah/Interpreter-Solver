FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle on a Cartesian coordinate plane. The circle intersects the axes at two points, and we are tasked with finding its center. Here's the step-by-step solution:

---

### Step 1: Identify Key Information
- The circle intersects the **x-axis** and the **y-axis**.
- The center of the circle appears to be located near the point \((-3, -3)\).
- The radius of the circle can be estimated visually, but we will use the properties of circles and their intersections to find the exact center.

---

### Step 2: Understand Geometric Relationships
The general equation of a circle is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]
where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle, and \(r\) is the radius.

#### Intersection Points:
1. **Intersection with the x-axis**: At this point, \(y = 0\). Let the x-intercept be \((a, 0)\).
2. **Intersection with the y-axis**: At this point, \(x = 0\). Let the y-intercept be \((0, b)\).

#### Center of the Circle:
The center \((h, k)\) of the circle is equidistant from both intercepts because the radius is constant. This means the center lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the intercepts.

---

### Step 3: Visual Estimation and Calculation
From the image:
- The circle intersects the **x-axis** at approximately \((-6, 0)\).
- The circle intersects the **y-axis** at approximately \((0, -6)\).

#### Midpoint of the Line Segment Joining Intercepts:
The midpoint of the line segment joining \((-6, 0)\) and \((0, -6)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{-6 + 0}{2}, \frac{0 + (-6)}{2} \right) = \left( -3, -3 \right)
\]

#### Radius Calculation:
The distance from the center \((-3, -3)\) to either intercept can be calculated using the distance formula:
\[
\text{Distance from } (-3, -3) \text{ to } (-6, 0):
\]
\[
r = \sqrt{(-6 - (-3))^2 + (0 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{(-6 + 3)^2 + (0 + 3)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]

This confirms that the center \((-3, -3)\) is indeed the correct location, as it is equidistant from both intercepts.

---

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
- The center \((-3, -3)\) is equidistant from \((-6, 0)\) and \((0, -6)\).
- The radius calculated is consistent with the visual representation of the circle.

---

### Final Answer:
The center of the circle is \((-3, -3)\).

\[
\boxed{(-3, -3)}
\]
