FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the total surface area of the composite figure, which consists of a cone and a hemisphere joined at their bases. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- Radius of the base of the cone and the hemisphere: \( r = 4 \, \text{cm} \)
- Perpendicular height of the cone: \( h = 10 \, \text{cm} \)

### Step 2: Surface Area of the Hemisphere
The surface area of a hemisphere consists of two parts:
1. The curved surface area of the hemisphere.
2. The base area of the hemisphere (which is not exposed since it is attached to the cone).

#### Curved Surface Area of the Hemisphere
The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 4 \):
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi (4)^2 = 2\pi \cdot 16 = 32\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Lateral Surface Area of the Cone
The lateral surface area of a cone is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area of Cone} = \pi r l
\]
where \( l \) is the slant height of the cone. We need to find \( l \) using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}
\]
Substituting \( r = 4 \) and \( h = 10 \):
\[
l = \sqrt{4^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{16 + 100} = \sqrt{116} = 2\sqrt{29} \, \text{cm}
\]
Now, substitute \( r = 4 \) and \( l = 2\sqrt{29} \) into the formula for the lateral surface area of the cone:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area of Cone} = \pi (4)(2\sqrt{29}) = 8\pi\sqrt{29} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Total Surface Area of the Composite Figure
The total surface area of the composite figure is the sum of the curved surface area of the hemisphere and the lateral surface area of the cone:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} + \text{Lateral Surface Area of Cone}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 32\pi + 8\pi\sqrt{29}
\]

### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
To find the numerical value, use \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
32\pi \approx 32 \times 3.14159 = 100.53072
\]
\[
8\pi\sqrt{29} \approx 8 \times 3.14159 \times \sqrt{29} \approx 8 \times 3.14159 \times 5.38516 \approx 137.34928
\]
Adding these values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 100.53072 + 137.34928 = 237.88 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{237.88 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
