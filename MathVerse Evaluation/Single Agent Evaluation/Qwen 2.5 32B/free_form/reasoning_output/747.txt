QUESTION:
All edges of the following cube are 7 cm long.

Find the exact length of AG in simplest surd form.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of \( AG \) in a cube where all edges are 7 cm long. The cube is labeled as follows:
- \( A, B, C, D \) form the top face.
- \( E, F, G, H \) form the bottom face.
- \( A \) is connected to \( E \), \( B \) to \( F \), \( C \) to \( G \), and \( D \) to \( H \).

The segment \( AG \) is a space diagonal of the cube, which connects a vertex on the top face (\( A \)) to the diagonally opposite vertex on the bottom face (\( G \)).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Cube
- Each edge of the cube has a length of 7 cm.
- The cube has 12 edges, 8 vertices, and 6 faces.
- The space diagonal \( AG \) spans from one corner of the cube to the farthest corner, passing through the interior of the cube.

#### Step 2: Use the Formula for the Space Diagonal of a Cube
The length of the space diagonal \( d \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by the formula:
\[
d = s\sqrt{3}
\]
Here, the side length \( s = 7 \) cm.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Length of \( AG \)
Substitute \( s = 7 \) into the formula:
\[
AG = 7\sqrt{3}
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Result
The formula \( s\sqrt{3} \) is derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied twice:
1. First, find the length of a face diagonal (e.g., \( AC \)):
   \[
   AC = \sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = \sqrt{7^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
   \]
2. Then, use the face diagonal \( AC \) and the height \( s \) to find the space diagonal \( AG \):
   \[
   AG = \sqrt{(7\sqrt{2})^2 + 7^2} = \sqrt{98 + 49} = \sqrt{147} = 7\sqrt{3}
   \]

Thus, the length of \( AG \) is indeed \( 7\sqrt{3} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{7\sqrt{3}}
\]
