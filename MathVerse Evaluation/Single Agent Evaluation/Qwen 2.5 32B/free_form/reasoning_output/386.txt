QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 45^\circ, one leg measuring 4\sqrt{3}. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the exact value of x.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a right-angled triangle with one of the acute angles measuring \(45^\circ\). This indicates that the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle, where the two legs are congruent, and the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of each leg.

#### Given Information:
- One leg of the triangle is \(4\sqrt{3}\).
- One of the acute angles is \(45^\circ\).
- We need to find the hypotenuse \(x\) and the other leg \(y\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the type of triangle
Since one of the acute angles is \(45^\circ\), the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle. In such triangles:
- The two legs are equal.
- The hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of each leg.

#### Step 2: Determine the lengths of the legs
The problem states that one leg is \(4\sqrt{3}\). Since the legs of a 45-45-90 triangle are equal, the other leg \(y\) is also \(4\sqrt{3}\):
\[
y = 4\sqrt{3}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the hypotenuse \(x\)
The hypotenuse \(x\) of a 45-45-90 triangle is given by:
\[
x = \sqrt{2} \times \text{(length of a leg)}
\]
Substituting the length of the leg:
\[
x = \sqrt{2} \times 4\sqrt{3}
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
x = 4\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{6}
\]

### Final Answer:
The exact value of \(x\) is \(4\sqrt{6}\).

\[
\boxed{4\sqrt{6}}
\]
