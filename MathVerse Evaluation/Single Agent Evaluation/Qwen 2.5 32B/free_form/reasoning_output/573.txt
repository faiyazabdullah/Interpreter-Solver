QUESTION:
Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2 in blue. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the equation of the function \( g(x) \), which is a translated version of the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The graph shows both \( f(x) \) in blue and \( g(x) \) in red. By analyzing the translations, we will derive the equation for \( g(x) \).

#### Step 1: Identify the Original Function
The original function \( f(x) = x^2 \) is a standard parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin \((0, 0)\).

#### Step 2: Analyze the Translation
From the graph:
- The vertex of \( f(x) = x^2 \) is at \((0, 0)\).
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \((-2, -3)\).

This indicates that:
1. The function \( g(x) \) is shifted horizontally to the left by 2 units.
2. The function \( g(x) \) is shifted vertically downward by 3 units.

#### Step 3: Apply Horizontal Translation
A horizontal shift of a function \( f(x) \) by \( h \) units is represented as \( f(x + h) \). Since the vertex of \( g(x) \) is shifted 2 units to the left, we replace \( x \) with \( x + 2 \) in \( f(x) \):
\[
f(x + 2) = (x + 2)^2
\]

#### Step 4: Apply Vertical Translation
A vertical shift of a function by \( k \) units is represented as \( f(x) + k \). Since the vertex of \( g(x) \) is shifted 3 units downward, we subtract 3 from the result of the horizontal translation:
\[
g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 3
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Equation
The derived equation \( g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 3 \) matches the behavior observed in the graph:
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \((-2, -3)\).
- The shape of the parabola remains the same as \( f(x) = x^2 \), but it is shifted accordingly.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 3}
\]
