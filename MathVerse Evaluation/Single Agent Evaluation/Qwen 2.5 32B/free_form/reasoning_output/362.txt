QUESTION:
The final approach of an aeroplane when landing requires the pilot to adjust their angle of descent to about 3Â°. If the plane is 12 metres above the runway and has d metres until touchdown, find d to the nearest metre.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the horizontal distance \( d \) that an airplane travels before touchdown, given its vertical height above the runway and the angle of descent. The key information provided is:
- The angle of descent: \( 3^\circ \)
- The vertical height above the runway: \( 12 \) meters
- The horizontal distance to touchdown: \( d \) meters

This is a classic trigonometry problem where we can use the tangent function to relate the angle of descent to the vertical and horizontal distances.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the relationship using trigonometry:**
   The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Here:
   \[
   \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
   \]
   where:
   - The angle \( \theta = 3^\circ \)
   - The opposite side is the vertical height above the runway, which is \( 12 \) meters
   - The adjacent side is the horizontal distance \( d \)

   Therefore:
   \[
   \tan(3^\circ) = \frac{12}{d}
   \]

2. **Rearrange the equation to solve for \( d \):**
   \[
   d = \frac{12}{\tan(3^\circ)}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( \tan(3^\circ) \):**
   Using a calculator, we find:
   \[
   \tan(3^\circ) \approx 0.0524
   \]

4. **Substitute \( \tan(3^\circ) \) into the equation:**
   \[
   d = \frac{12}{0.0524}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   d \approx \frac{12}{0.0524} \approx 229.01
   \]

6. **Round to the nearest meter:**
   Since the problem asks for \( d \) to the nearest meter, we round \( 229.01 \) to \( 229 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{229}
\]
