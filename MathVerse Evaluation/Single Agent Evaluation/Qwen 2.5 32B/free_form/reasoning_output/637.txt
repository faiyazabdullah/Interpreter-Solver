QUESTION:
A square prism has sides of length 11cm, 11cm and 15cm as shown.

Now, we want to find $y$, the length of the diagonal $DF$.

Calculate $y$ to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for the length of the diagonal \( DF \) in the given square prism, let's follow the solution steps systematically.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- The prism is a rectangular prism with dimensions:
  - Height \( AB = EF = 11 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Width \( BF = FG = 11 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Length \( BG = GH = 15 \, \text{cm} \)

- We need to find the length of the space diagonal \( DF \).

---

### **Step 2: Visualize and break down the problem**
The diagonal \( DF \) is a space diagonal of the rectangular prism. To calculate it, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. The formula for the length of the space diagonal \( DF \) in a rectangular prism with dimensions \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) is:
\[
DF = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2 + h^2}
\]
Here:
- \( l = BG = 15 \, \text{cm} \) (length)
- \( w = BF = 11 \, \text{cm} \) (width)
- \( h = BE = 11 \, \text{cm} \) (height)

---

### **Step 3: Apply the formula**
Substitute the given values into the formula:
\[
DF = \sqrt{BG^2 + BF^2 + BE^2}
\]
\[
DF = \sqrt{15^2 + 11^2 + 11^2}
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
15^2 = 225
\]
\[
11^2 = 121
\]
\[
11^2 = 121
\]

Add these values together:
\[
DF = \sqrt{225 + 121 + 121}
\]
\[
DF = \sqrt{467}
\]

---

### **Step 4: Compute the square root**
Using a calculator, find the square root of 467:
\[
\sqrt{467} \approx 21.61
\]

---

### **Step 5: Present the final answer**
The length of the diagonal \( DF \) is approximately \( 21.61 \, \text{cm} \).

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{21.61}
\]
