QUESTION:
There is a blue rectangular with four vertexes (-6,5), (-6,-1), (10,5), (10,-1). The two diagonals are red and intersect with each other at (2,2). Find the coordinates of the midpoint for each diagonal.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the coordinates of the midpoint for each diagonal of a blue rectangle. The vertices of the rectangle are given as:
- \( (-6, 5) \)
- \( (-6, -1) \)
- \( (10, 5) \)
- \( (10, -1) \)

The diagonals of the rectangle are drawn in red and intersect at the point \( (2, 2) \). We need to find the midpoints of these diagonals.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
A key property of a rectangle is that its diagonals bisect each other. This means the intersection point of the diagonals is also the midpoint of each diagonal. Since the diagonals intersect at \( (2, 2) \), this point is the midpoint of both diagonals.

#### Step 2: Verifying the Midpoint Formula
The midpoint formula for a line segment with endpoints \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
\]

We can confirm that the intersection point \( (2, 2) \) is indeed the midpoint of each diagonal by calculating it explicitly.

#### Step 3: Calculating the Midpoint of Each Diagonal
##### Diagonal 1: Connecting \((-6, 5)\) and \((10, -1)\)
Using the midpoint formula:
\[
\left( \frac{-6 + 10}{2}, \frac{5 + (-1)}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{4}{2}, \frac{4}{2} \right) = (2, 2)
\]

##### Diagonal 2: Connecting \((-6, -1)\) and \((10, 5)\)
Using the midpoint formula:
\[
\left( \frac{-6 + 10}{2}, \frac{-1 + 5}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{4}{2}, \frac{4}{2} \right) = (2, 2)
\]

#### Step 4: Conclusion
Both calculations confirm that the midpoint of each diagonal is \( (2, 2) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(2, 2)}
\]
