QUESTION:
The line passes (2,-1), (5,1), (8,3), (11,5). Find the equation of the line in point-slope form .

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
The problem provides four points that lie on a straight line:
- \( (2, -1) \)
- \( (5, 1) \)
- \( (8, 3) \)
- \( (11, 5) \)

We need to find the equation of the line in point-slope form. The point-slope form of a line is given by:
\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]
where \( m \) is the slope of the line, and \( (x_1, y_1) \) is a point on the line.

#### Step 2: Calculate the slope \( m \)
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Using the points \( (2, -1) \) and \( (5, 1) \):
\[ m = \frac{1 - (-1)}{5 - 2} = \frac{1 + 1}{5 - 2} = \frac{2}{3} \]

Thus, the slope \( m \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

#### Step 3: Choose a point to use in the point-slope form
We can use any of the given points to write the equation in point-slope form. Let's use the point \( (2, -1) \).

#### Step 4: Write the equation in point-slope form
Using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) and substituting \( m = \frac{2}{3} \) and the point \( (2, -1) \):
\[ y - (-1) = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2) \]
\[ y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2) \]

#### Step 5: Verify the equation with another point
To ensure the equation is correct, we can substitute another point, such as \( (5, 1) \), into the equation:
\[ y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2) \]
Substitute \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 1 \):
\[ 1 + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(5 - 2) \]
\[ 2 = \frac{2}{3}(3) \]
\[ 2 = 2 \]
The equation holds true, confirming its correctness.

#### Final Answer:
The equation of the line in point-slope form is:
\[ y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2) \]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)}\]
