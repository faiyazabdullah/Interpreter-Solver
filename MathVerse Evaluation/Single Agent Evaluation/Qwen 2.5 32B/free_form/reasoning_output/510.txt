QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is -6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem provides the following key information:
1. The x-intercept of the line is \(-3\).
2. The y-intercept of the line is \(-6\).
3. The shaded region in the graph lies above the line, indicating that the inequality will involve a "greater than" or "less than" relationship.

#### Step 1: Determine the Equation of the Line
The x-intercept is \((-3, 0)\), and the y-intercept is \((0, -6)\). Using these points, we can find the slope (\(m\)) of the line:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-6 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{-6}{3} = -2
\]
The slope-intercept form of a line is \(y = mx + b\). Substituting \(m = -2\) and the y-intercept \(b = -6\):
\[
y = -2x - 6
\]

#### Step 2: Determine the Inequality
The shaded region in the graph lies above the line \(y = -2x - 6\). This means that the inequality describing the shaded region is:
\[
y > -2x - 6
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the Shaded Region
From the graph, we observe that the shaded area is indeed above the line, confirming that the inequality should be "greater than" rather than "less than."

### Final Answer:
The inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane is:
\[
\boxed{y > -2x - 6}
\]
