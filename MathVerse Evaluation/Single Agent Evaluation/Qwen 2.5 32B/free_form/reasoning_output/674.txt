### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a cylinder containing two identical spherical balls that fit exactly inside it. We are tasked with finding the surface area of each ball. Let's break this down step by step.

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- The cylinder has a **radius** of \(2.5 \, \text{cm}\) and a **height** of \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
- Two identical spherical balls fit exactly inside the cylinder. This means:
  - The diameter of each ball is equal to the diameter of the cylinder.
  - The combined height of the two balls is equal to the height of the cylinder.

#### Step 2: Determine the Radius of Each Ball
- The radius of the cylinder is given as \(2.5 \, \text{cm}\). Since the diameter of each ball is equal to the diameter of the cylinder, the radius of each ball is also \(2.5 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Step 3: Calculate the Surface Area of One Ball
The formula for the surface area \(A\) of a sphere is:
\[
A = 4\pi r^2
\]
where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

Substitute \(r = 2.5 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
A = 4\pi (2.5)^2
\]
\[
A = 4\pi (6.25)
\]
\[
A = 25\pi
\]

#### Step 4: Approximate the Surface Area
To express the surface area to one decimal place, we use the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
A \approx 25 \times 3.14159
\]
\[
A \approx 78.53975
\]
Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
A \approx 78.5
\]

#### Final Answer:
The surface area of each ball is:
\[
\boxed{78.5 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
