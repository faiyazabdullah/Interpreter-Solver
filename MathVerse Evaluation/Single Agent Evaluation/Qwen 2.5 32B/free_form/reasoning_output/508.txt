QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the line whose x-intercept is 0.5 and y-intercept is 2. What is the slope of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the slope of a line given its x-intercept and y-intercept. The x-intercept is given as \(0.5\) and the y-intercept is given as \(2\). The slope of a line can be determined using the formula for the slope between two points.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The x-intercept is \(0.5\). This means the line crosses the x-axis at the point \((0.5, 0)\).
- The y-intercept is \(2\). This means the line crosses the y-axis at the point \((0, 2)\).

#### Step 2: Recall the formula for the slope
The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

#### Step 3: Substitute the coordinates of the intercepts into the slope formula
Here, the two points are:
- \((x_1, y_1) = (0.5, 0)\)
- \((x_2, y_2) = (0, 2)\)

Substitute these coordinates into the slope formula:
\[
m = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - 0.5} = \frac{2}{-0.5}
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the expression
\[
m = \frac{2}{-0.5} = 2 \div -0.5 = 2 \times \left(-\frac{1}{0.5}\right) = 2 \times (-2) = -4
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the result
The slope \(m = -4\) indicates that the line is decreasing, which aligns with the visual representation in the provided graph. The line crosses the x-axis at \(x = 0.5\) and the y-axis at \(y = 2\), confirming the correctness of our calculation.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{-4}
\]
