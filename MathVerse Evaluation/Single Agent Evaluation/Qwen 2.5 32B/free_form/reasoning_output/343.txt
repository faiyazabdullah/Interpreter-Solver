QUESTION:
Given the diagram shown, if the bearing of the clearing from the town is aÂ°. Starting from town, heading 3.2 kilometers due north and then 5.9 kilometers due east is clearing. Find a to the nearest degree.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the angle \( a^\circ \) representing the bearing of the clearing from the town. The bearing is the direction measured clockwise from true north. From the diagram:
- The town is at point \( O \).
- Traveling 3.2 km due north from \( O \) brings you to point \( N \).
- Traveling 5.9 km due east from \( N \) brings you to the clearing.
- The angle \( a^\circ \) is the angle formed between the north direction (due north from \( O \)) and the line segment \( ON \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Understanding the Geometry:
- The path from the town \( O \) to the clearing forms a right triangle with:
  - The vertical leg \( ON = 3.2 \) km (northward distance).
  - The horizontal leg \( NC = 5.9 \) km (eastward distance).
  - The hypotenuse \( OC \) is the straight-line distance from the town to the clearing.

#### 2. Identify the Angle \( a \):
The angle \( a \) is the angle between the north direction (vertical leg \( ON \)) and the hypotenuse \( OC \). This angle can be determined using trigonometry, specifically the tangent function:
\[
\tan(a) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{\text{horizontal distance}}{\text{vertical distance}} = \frac{NC}{ON} = \frac{5.9}{3.2}
\]

#### 3. Calculate \( \tan(a) \):
\[
\tan(a) = \frac{5.9}{3.2} \approx 1.84375
\]

#### 4. Solve for \( a \):
To find \( a \), we take the inverse tangent (arctangent) of 1.84375:
\[
a = \arctan(1.84375)
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
a \approx 61.57^\circ
\]

#### 5. Round to the Nearest Degree:
Rounding \( 61.57^\circ \) to the nearest degree gives:
\[
a \approx 62^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{62^\circ}
\]
