QUESTION:
There are two curves with a vertical asymptote x=3. One curve passes (1,0), and another curve passes (4,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a graph of a function with a vertical asymptote at \( x = 3 \). The function has two branches:
1. One branch passes through the point \( (1, 0) \).
2. The other branch passes through the point \( (4, 0) \).

The goal is to determine the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Key Features of the Graph**
- **Vertical Asymptote**: The function has a vertical asymptote at \( x = 3 \). This means the function approaches \( \pm \infty \) as \( x \) approaches 3 from either side.
- **Branches**: 
  - The left branch (for \( x < 3 \)) starts from the left, passes through \( (1, 0) \), and decreases as it approaches the asymptote.
  - The right branch (for \( x > 3 \)) starts from the right, passes through \( (4, 0) \), and decreases as it approaches the asymptote.
- **Behavior Near the Asymptote**: The function approaches negative infinity as \( x \) approaches 3 from both sides.

#### **Step 2: Determine Increasing/Decreasing Intervals**
To determine whether the function is increasing or decreasing, we analyze the slope of the function in different intervals:
1. **Interval \( (-\infty, 3) \)**:
   - The function is defined for \( x < 3 \).
   - Observing the graph, the function is **decreasing** as it moves from left to right in this interval.
2. **Interval \( (3, \infty) \)**:
   - The function is defined for \( x > 3 \).
   - Observing the graph, the function is also **decreasing** as it moves from left to right in this interval.

#### **Step 3: Verify Critical Points**
- The points \( (1, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \) are zeros of the function, but they do not affect the increasing/decreasing nature of the function. The function's behavior is determined by its slope, which is consistently negative in both intervals.

#### **Step 4: Conclusion**
- The function is **decreasing** on both intervals \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(-\infty, 3) \cup (3, \infty)}
\]
