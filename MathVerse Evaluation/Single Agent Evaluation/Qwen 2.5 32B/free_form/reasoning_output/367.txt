QUESTION:
Sand has an angle of friction of about 40Â°. This means once it gets over this it slides down the side of the sand pile. Mae is getting a delivery of sand to her home, but the area where the sand will be delivered is only 10.6 metres wide. If h metres is the maximum height of the sandpile, find h to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Figure and Given Information
- The image shows a triangular sandpile with a base width of \(10.6\) meters.
- The sandpile forms an angle of \(40^\circ\) with the horizontal at its sides.
- The height of the sandpile is denoted as \(h\) meters.
- The problem involves finding the maximum height \(h\) of the sandpile, given that the sand's angle of repose (angle of friction) is \(40^\circ\).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- The sandpile forms an isosceles triangle with the base \(10.6\) meters.
- The height \(h\) of the sandpile is perpendicular to the base, dividing the triangle into two right triangles.
- Each right triangle has:
  - One leg as the height \(h\).
  - Another leg as half the base, which is \(\frac{10.6}{2} = 5.3\) meters.
  - The angle between the height and the hypotenuse is \(40^\circ\).

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find the maximum height \(h\) of the sandpile.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Formulas
- In the right triangle formed, we can use trigonometry to relate the height \(h\) to the base.
- Specifically, we use the tangent function:
  \[
  \tan(40^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{h}{5.3}
  \]
- Solving for \(h\):
  \[
  h = 5.3 \cdot \tan(40^\circ)
  \]

#### Step 5: Perform the Calculations
- First, calculate \(\tan(40^\circ)\):
  \[
  \tan(40^\circ) \approx 0.8391
  \]
- Now, substitute this value into the equation for \(h\):
  \[
  h = 5.3 \cdot 0.8391 \approx 4.45723
  \]
- Round the result to one decimal place:
  \[
  h \approx 4.5
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4.5}
\]
