QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 30^\circ, one leg measuring 8.5. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown P.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a right-angled triangle with the following information:
- One of the acute angles is \(30^\circ\).
- One leg adjacent to the \(30^\circ\) angle measures 8.5 units.
- The hypotenuse is labeled as \(P\).

We need to find the length of the hypotenuse \(P\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify the type of triangle:
The triangle is a **right-angled triangle** with a \(30^\circ\) angle. This means it is a **30-60-90 triangle**, which has specific side ratios:
- The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is half the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.

#### 2. Assign variables and known values:
- Let the hypotenuse be \(P\).
- The leg adjacent to the \(30^\circ\) angle (which is also the shorter leg) is given as 8.5 units.
- In a 30-60-90 triangle, the shorter leg is half the hypotenuse. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Shorter leg} = \frac{P}{2}
  \]

#### 3. Set up the equation:
From the given information, the shorter leg is 8.5 units. Thus:
\[
\frac{P}{2} = 8.5
\]

#### 4. Solve for \(P\):
Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \(P\):
\[
P = 8.5 \times 2
\]
\[
P = 17
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]
