### Problem Analysis:
We are given a graph of a trigonometric function that intersects its midline at two points: $\left(\frac{3}{5}\pi, 8\right)$ and $\left(\frac{7}{5}\pi, 8\right)$. The goal is to determine the period of the function.

#### Step 1: Understand the Midline and Intersections
- The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line about which the function oscillates. In this case, the midline is the line $y = 8$, as indicated by the intersections at $y = 8$.
- The function intersects the midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5}\pi, 8\right)$ and $\left(\frac{7}{5}\pi, 8\right)$. These points represent the locations where the function crosses from above to below (or vice versa) the midline.

#### Step 2: Determine the Period
- The period of a trigonometric function is the horizontal distance over which the function completes one full cycle. For sine or cosine functions, the period is the distance between two consecutive points where the function returns to the same value with the same direction of motion.
- Since the function intersects the midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5}\pi, 8\right)$ and $\left(\frac{7}{5}\pi, 8\right)$, the distance between these two points is half the period. This is because the function crosses the midline twice per period (once while going up and once while going down).

#### Step 3: Calculate the Distance Between the Points
The horizontal distance between the two points is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{7}{5}\pi - \frac{3}{5}\pi = \frac{4}{5}\pi
\]
This distance represents half the period of the function.

#### Step 4: Find the Full Period
Since the distance between the two midline intersections is half the period, the full period $P$ is:
\[
P = 2 \times \frac{4}{5}\pi = \frac{8}{5}\pi
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{5}\pi}
\]
