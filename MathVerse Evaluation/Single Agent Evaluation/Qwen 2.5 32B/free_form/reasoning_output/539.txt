QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves analyzing a trigonometric function's graph to determine its period. The key information provided includes:
- A minimum point at \( \left( -\frac{1}{2}\pi, 2.4 \right) \).
- A maximum point at \( \left( \frac{3}{2}\pi, 13 \right) \).

From the graph, we observe that the function appears to be sinusoidal (likely a sine or cosine function). The period of a trigonometric function is the horizontal distance over which the function repeats itself.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Key Points
The minimum point is at \( \left( -\frac{1}{2}\pi, 2.4 \right) \), and the maximum point is at \( \left( \frac{3}{2}\pi, 13 \right) \). These points help us determine the phase shift and amplitude, but more importantly, they help us find the period.

#### Step 2: Determine the Horizontal Distance Between Consecutive Maximum/Minimum Points
The period of a sinusoidal function is the distance between two consecutive maximum points or two consecutive minimum points. However, since we have a minimum point and a maximum point, we can use these to infer half the period.

The horizontal distance between the minimum point \( \left( -\frac{1}{2}\pi \right) \) and the maximum point \( \left( \frac{3}{2}\pi \right) \) is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{3}{2}\pi - \left( -\frac{1}{2}\pi \right) = \frac{3}{2}\pi + \frac{1}{2}\pi = 2\pi
\]

This distance represents half the period of the function because it spans from a minimum to a maximum. Therefore, the full period \( T \) is twice this distance:
\[
T = 2 \times 2\pi = 4\pi
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the Period
To confirm, observe the symmetry and repetition in the graph. The function appears to repeat every \( 4\pi \) units horizontally, supporting our calculation.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4\pi}
\]
