QUESTION:
Consider the solid pictured and answer the following:

Hence what is the total surface area? The outer radius is 11 cm, inner radius is 10 cm and length 24 cm.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the total surface area of the given solid, let's follow the solution steps systematically.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information
The solid is a hollow cylinder (a cylindrical shell). The dimensions provided are:
- Outer radius (\( R \)): \( 11 \) cm
- Inner radius (\( r \)): \( 10 \) cm
- Length (\( h \)): \( 24 \) cm

The total surface area of a hollow cylinder includes:
1. The lateral surface area of the outer cylinder.
2. The lateral surface area of the inner cylinder.
3. The areas of the two circular ends (top and bottom).

---

### Step 2: Formula for the total surface area
The total surface area (\( A \)) of a hollow cylinder is given by:
\[
A = \text{Lateral Surface Area of Outer Cylinder} + \text{Lateral Surface Area of Inner Cylinder} + \text{Areas of Two Circular Ends}
\]

#### 1. Lateral Surface Area of the Outer Cylinder
The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi Rh
\]
For the outer cylinder:
\[
R = 11 \, \text{cm}, \quad h = 24 \, \text{cm}
\]
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area}_{\text{outer}} = 2\pi (11)(24) = 528\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### 2. Lateral Surface Area of the Inner Cylinder
Similarly, for the inner cylinder:
\[
r = 10 \, \text{cm}, \quad h = 24 \, \text{cm}
\]
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area}_{\text{inner}} = 2\pi (10)(24) = 480\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### 3. Areas of the Two Circular Ends
The area of one circular end is the difference between the area of the outer circle and the area of the inner circle:
\[
\text{Area of One Circular End} = \pi R^2 - \pi r^2 = \pi (R^2 - r^2)
\]
Substitute \( R = 11 \) cm and \( r = 10 \) cm:
\[
R^2 = 11^2 = 121, \quad r^2 = 10^2 = 100
\]
\[
R^2 - r^2 = 121 - 100 = 21
\]
\[
\text{Area of One Circular End} = \pi (21) = 21\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Since there are two circular ends, the total area of the two ends is:
\[
\text{Total Area of Two Circular Ends} = 2 \times 21\pi = 42\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Total Surface Area
Now, sum up all the components:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area}_{\text{outer}} + \text{Lateral Surface Area}_{\text{inner}} + \text{Total Area of Two Circular Ends}
\]
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 528\pi + 480\pi + 42\pi = 1050\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
1050\pi \approx 1050 \times 3.14159 = 3298.9745 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Rounding to the nearest two decimal places:
\[
1050\pi \approx 3299.00 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{3299.00 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
