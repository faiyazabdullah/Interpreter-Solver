QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

How much faster is Oliver traveling?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves analyzing a graph showing the progress of two cyclists, Oliver and Justin, in a race. The x-axis represents Time (in hours), and the y-axis represents Distance (in kilometers). We need to determine how much faster Oliver is traveling compared to Justin.

#### Step 1: Extract Information from the Graph
From the graph:
- **Oliver's Data Point**: At \( t = 5 \) hours, Oliver has traveled \( d = 175 \) km.
- **Justin's Data Point**: At \( t = 5 \) hours, Justin has traveled \( d = 125 \) km.

#### Step 2: Calculate Speeds
Speed is defined as the rate of change of distance with respect to time, i.e., \( \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \).

- **Oliver's Speed**:
  \[
  \text{Speed}_{\text{Oliver}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Oliver}}}{\text{Time}_{\text{Oliver}}} = \frac{175 \text{ km}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 35 \text{ km/h}
  \]

- **Justin's Speed**:
  \[
  \text{Speed}_{\text{Justin}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Justin}}}{\text{Time}_{\text{Justin}}} = \frac{125 \text{ km}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 25 \text{ km/h}
  \]

#### Step 3: Determine the Difference in Speed
To find how much faster Oliver is traveling, we calculate the difference between Oliver's speed and Justin's speed:
\[
\text{Difference in Speed} = \text{Speed}_{\text{Oliver}} - \text{Speed}_{\text{Justin}} = 35 \text{ km/h} - 25 \text{ km/h} = 10 \text{ km/h}
\]

#### Step 4: Interpret the Result
Oliver is traveling 10 km/h faster than Justin.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{10 \text{ km/h}}
\]
