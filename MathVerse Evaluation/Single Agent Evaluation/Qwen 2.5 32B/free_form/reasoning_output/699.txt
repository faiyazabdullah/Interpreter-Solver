QUESTION:
Consider the following cube with a side length equal to 6 cm. The nine marked edges have the same length. Find the total surface area.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a cube with a side length of \(6 \, \text{cm}\). All nine marked edges have the same length, which confirms that the shape is indeed a cube. The goal is to find the total surface area of the cube.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of a Cube
A cube is a three-dimensional shape with six faces, all of which are squares. Each face has an area equal to the side length squared (\(s^2\)). Since all faces are identical, the total surface area of the cube is the sum of the areas of its six faces.

#### Step 2: Given Information
The side length of the cube is \(s = 6 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Step 3: Formula for Surface Area of a Cube
The surface area \(A\) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[
A = 6s^2
\]
where \(s\) is the side length of the cube.

#### Step 4: Substitute the Given Side Length
Substitute \(s = 6 \, \text{cm}\) into the formula:
\[
A = 6 \times (6 \, \text{cm})^2
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Area of One Face
First, calculate the area of one face:
\[
(6 \, \text{cm})^2 = 36 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 6: Calculate the Total Surface Area
Now, multiply the area of one face by 6:
\[
A = 6 \times 36 \, \text{cm}^2 = 216 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The total surface area of the cube is:
\[
\boxed{216 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
