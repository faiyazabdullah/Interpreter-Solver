QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the pyramid. The perpendicular height is 8mm. The base is a square with the edge of 10mm. Include all faces in your calculations.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the surface area of the pyramid, we will follow the steps outlined below:

---

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The base of the pyramid is a square with side length \( s = 10 \, \text{mm} \).
- The perpendicular height of the pyramid (from the apex to the center of the base) is \( h = 8 \, \text{mm} \).

### Step 2: Understand the structure of the pyramid
The pyramid has:
1. One square base.
2. Four triangular lateral faces.

The surface area of the pyramid is the sum of the area of the base and the areas of the four triangular faces.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the base
The base is a square with side length \( s = 10 \, \text{mm} \). The area of the base is:
\[
\text{Area of the base} = s^2 = 10^2 = 100 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine the slant height of the triangular faces
Each triangular face is an isosceles triangle. To find the area of one triangular face, we need the slant height (\( l \)) of the triangle. The slant height can be found using the right triangle formed by:
- The perpendicular height of the pyramid (\( h = 8 \, \text{mm} \)),
- Half the diagonal of the square base,
- The slant height (\( l \)) as the hypotenuse.

#### Step 4.1: Calculate half the diagonal of the square base
The diagonal of the square base is:
\[
\text{Diagonal} = s\sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2} \, \text{mm}
\]
Half the diagonal is:
\[
\frac{\text{Diagonal}}{2} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2} \, \text{mm}
\]

#### Step 4.2: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height
In the right triangle formed by the perpendicular height (\( h \)), half the diagonal (\( 5\sqrt{2} \)), and the slant height (\( l \)):
\[
l = \sqrt{h^2 + \left(\frac{\text{Diagonal}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + (5\sqrt{2})^2}
\]
\[
l = \sqrt{64 + 50} = \sqrt{114} \, \text{mm}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the area of one triangular face
Each triangular face is an isosceles triangle with:
- Base \( s = 10 \, \text{mm} \),
- Slant height \( l = \sqrt{114} \, \text{mm} \).

The area of one triangular face is:
\[
\text{Area of one triangular face} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{slant height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times \sqrt{114}
\]
\[
\text{Area of one triangular face} = 5\sqrt{114} \, \text{mm}^2
\]

Since there are four identical triangular faces, the total area of the four triangular faces is:
\[
\text{Total area of the four triangular faces} = 4 \times 5\sqrt{114} = 20\sqrt{114} \, \text{mm}^2
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total surface area
The total surface area of the pyramid is the sum of the area of the base and the total area of the four triangular faces:
\[
\text{Surface Area} = \text{Area of the base} + \text{Total area of the four triangular faces}
\]
\[
\text{Surface Area} = 100 + 20\sqrt{114}
\]

---

### Step 7: Approximate the numerical value
Using a calculator:
\[
\sqrt{114} \approx 10.677
\]
\[
20\sqrt{114} \approx 20 \times 10.677 = 213.54
\]
\[
\text{Surface Area} \approx 100 + 213.54 = 313.54 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{313.54 \, \text{mm}^2}
\]
