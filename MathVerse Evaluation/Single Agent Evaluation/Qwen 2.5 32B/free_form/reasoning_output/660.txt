FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the height \( h \) of a cylinder given its surface area and radius. The surface area of a cylinder is composed of three parts:
1. The lateral surface area.
2. The area of the top circular base.
3. The area of the bottom circular base.

#### Given:
- Surface area of the cylinder: \( 54105 \, \text{mm}^2 \).
- Radius of the cylinder: \( r = 79 \, \text{mm} \).
- Height of the cylinder: \( h \, \text{mm} \).

#### Objective:
Find the height \( h \) of the cylinder, rounded to the nearest whole number.

---

### Step 1: Formula for the Surface Area of a Cylinder
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
A = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2
\]
where:
- \( 2\pi r h \) is the lateral surface area.
- \( 2\pi r^2 \) is the combined area of the top and bottom circular bases.

#### Substituting the given values:
- Radius \( r = 79 \, \text{mm} \).
- Surface area \( A = 54105 \, \text{mm}^2 \).

The formula becomes:
\[
54105 = 2\pi (79) h + 2\pi (79)^2
\]

---

### Step 2: Simplify the Equation
First, calculate the constant terms involving \( \pi \):
1. The term \( 2\pi (79)^2 \):
\[
(79)^2 = 6241
\]
\[
2\pi (79)^2 = 2\pi \cdot 6241 = 12482\pi
\]

2. The term \( 2\pi (79) h \):
\[
2\pi (79) h = 158\pi h
\]

Substitute these into the surface area equation:
\[
54105 = 158\pi h + 12482\pi
\]

Factor out \( \pi \) from the right-hand side:
\[
54105 = \pi (158h + 12482)
\]

---

### Step 3: Solve for \( h \)
Divide both sides by \( \pi \):
\[
\frac{54105}{\pi} = 158h + 12482
\]

Calculate \( \frac{54105}{\pi} \):
\[
\pi \approx 3.14159
\]
\[
\frac{54105}{\pi} \approx \frac{54105}{3.14159} \approx 17222.37
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
17222.37 = 158h + 12482
\]

Isolate \( h \):
\[
17222.37 - 12482 = 158h
\]
\[
4740.37 = 158h
\]

Solve for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{4740.37}{158}
\]
\[
h \approx 30.0023
\]

---

### Step 4: Round to the Nearest Whole Number
Rounding \( h \approx 30.0023 \) to the nearest whole number gives:
\[
h = 30
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
