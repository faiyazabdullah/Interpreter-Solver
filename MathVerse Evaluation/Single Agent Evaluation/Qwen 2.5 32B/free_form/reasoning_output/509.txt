### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a Cartesian coordinate plane with a horizontal line at \( y = 5 \). The line is parallel to the x-axis, and the shaded region lies above this line. The task is to write the inequality that describes the points in the shaded region.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The line is parallel to the x-axis and is located at \( y = 5 \).
- The shaded region is above this line, indicating that the y-coordinates of all points in the shaded region are greater than 5.

#### Step 2: Understand the geometric relationship
- Any point in the shaded region has a y-coordinate strictly greater than 5. This is because the shaded area is entirely above the line \( y = 5 \).

#### Step 3: Identify what needs to be found
- We need to write an inequality that describes the set of all points \((x, y)\) in the shaded region. Specifically, we need to express the condition that the y-coordinate of each point in the shaded region is greater than 5.

#### Step 4: Apply relevant geometric properties
- Since the shaded region is above the line \( y = 5 \), the inequality describing this region is \( y > 5 \). This ensures that all points in the shaded region satisfy the condition of having a y-coordinate strictly greater than 5.

#### Step 5: Write the final inequality
- The inequality that describes the shaded region is \( y > 5 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y > 5}
\]
