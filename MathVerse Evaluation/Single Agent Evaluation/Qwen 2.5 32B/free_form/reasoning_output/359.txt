QUESTION:
Consider the following diagram. The height of the rectangle in the picture is 63, the angle enclosed by the purple arc is 67° and the angle pointed by the arrow is 39°. Hence, find x, correct to one decimal place.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric figure with a rectangle and several angles. Here's a breakdown of the given information and what we need to determine:

1. **Given Information**:
   - The height of the rectangle is \( 63 \).
   - The angle enclosed by the purple arc is \( 67^\circ \).
   - The angle pointed by the arrow is \( 39^\circ \).

2. **Objective**:
   - Find the value of \( x \), which represents the length of the base of the rectangle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
The diagram shows a rectangle with height \( 63 \). There are two key angles:
- A \( 39^\circ \) angle formed by the diagonal of the rectangle and the horizontal side.
- A \( 67^\circ \) angle formed by the diagonal and the vertical side of the rectangle.

The diagonal divides the rectangle into two right triangles. We can use trigonometric relationships to relate the sides of these triangles.

#### Step 2: Use Trigonometry
Let's denote:
- The length of the diagonal as \( d \).
- The base of the rectangle as \( x \).

From the right triangle formed by the diagonal, the height \( 63 \), and the base \( x \):
- The angle between the diagonal and the base is \( 39^\circ \).
- The angle between the diagonal and the height is \( 67^\circ \).

Using the tangent function for the \( 39^\circ \) angle:
\[
\tan(39^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{63}{x}
\]
This gives:
\[
x = \frac{63}{\tan(39^\circ)}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate \( x \)
We need to compute \( \tan(39^\circ) \):
\[
\tan(39^\circ) \approx 0.809784
\]
Substitute this value into the equation for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{63}{0.809784} \approx 77.8
\]

#### Step 4: Verify Consistency
To ensure consistency, we can also use the \( 67^\circ \) angle. The cosine function relates the adjacent side to the hypotenuse:
\[
\cos(67^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{x}{d}
\]
However, since we are directly solving for \( x \) using the \( 39^\circ \) angle, this verification is not necessary for the final answer.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{77.8}
\]
