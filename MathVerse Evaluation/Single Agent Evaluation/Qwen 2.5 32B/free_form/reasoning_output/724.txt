FINAL RESPONSE:

### Analysis of the Problem:
The image shows a cube. The key information provided is that the side length of the cube is given as \( x + 4 \). We are tasked with finding the polynomial that represents the volume of the cube.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Cube's Properties
- A cube has all sides of equal length.
- The side length of the cube is given as \( x + 4 \).
- The volume \( V \) of a cube is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  V = \text{side length}^3
  \]

#### Step 2: Applying the Volume Formula
Since the side length of the cube is \( x + 4 \), we substitute this into the volume formula:
\[
V = (x + 4)^3
\]

#### Step 3: Expanding the Polynomial
To find the polynomial representation of the volume, we need to expand \( (x + 4)^3 \). Using the binomial theorem or direct expansion:
\[
(x + 4)^3 = (x + 4)(x + 4)(x + 4)
\]
First, expand \( (x + 4)(x + 4) \):
\[
(x + 4)(x + 4) = x^2 + 4x + 4x + 16 = x^2 + 8x + 16
\]
Next, multiply the result by \( x + 4 \):
\[
(x^2 + 8x + 16)(x + 4) = x^2(x + 4) + 8x(x + 4) + 16(x + 4)
\]
Distribute each term:
\[
x^2(x + 4) = x^3 + 4x^2
\]
\[
8x(x + 4) = 8x^2 + 32x
\]
\[
16(x + 4) = 16x + 64
\]
Combine all terms:
\[
x^3 + 4x^2 + 8x^2 + 32x + 16x + 64 = x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 64
\]

#### Step 4: Final Polynomial
The polynomial that represents the volume of the cube is:
\[
V = x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 64
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 64}
\]
