FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem provides the following information about a trigonometric function:
1. The function has a maximum point at $(1.2, 5.5)$.
2. The amplitude of the function is $3.5$.

We are tasked with finding the equation of the **midline** of the function.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Midline
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that lies halfway between the maximum and minimum values of the function. It is a key feature that helps us determine the vertical shift of the function.

#### Step 2: Key Properties of Trigonometric Functions
- **Amplitude**: The amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum (or minimum) value of the function. Given that the amplitude is $3.5$, we know:
  $$
  \text{Amplitude} = \frac{\text{Maximum Value} - \text{Minimum Value}}{2}.
  $$
- **Midline Equation**: The midline is given by the formula:
  $$
  y = \text{Midline Value},
  $$
  where the midline value is the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function.

#### Step 3: Extracting Information from the Graph
From the problem, we know:
- The maximum point is at $(1.2, 5.5)$, so the maximum value of the function is $5.5$.
- The amplitude is $3.5$. Since the amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum (or minimum), the midline value can be calculated as follows:
  $$
  \text{Midline Value} = \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Amplitude}.
  $$

#### Step 4: Calculating the Midline Value
Using the given maximum value ($5.5$) and the amplitude ($3.5$):
$$
\text{Midline Value} = 5.5 - 3.5 = 2.
$$

Thus, the midline of the function is the horizontal line $y = 2$.

#### Step 5: Verifying the Result
The midline value ensures that the function oscillates symmetrically around $y = 2$. Given the maximum value is $5.5$, the minimum value would be:
$$
\text{Minimum Value} = \text{Midline Value} - \text{Amplitude} = 2 - 3.5 = -1.5.
$$
This confirms that the function oscillates between $5.5$ (maximum) and $-1.5$ (minimum), with the midline at $y = 2$.

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{y = 2}
$$
