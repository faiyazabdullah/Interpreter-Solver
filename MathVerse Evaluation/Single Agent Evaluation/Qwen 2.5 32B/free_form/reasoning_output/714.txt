### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a composite solid consisting of:
1. A rectangular prism at the base.
2. A triangular prism on top of the rectangular prism.

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- **Base Rectangular Prism:**
  - Length \( l = 6 \, \text{m} \)
  - Width \( w = 5 \, \text{m} \)
  - Height \( h = 10 \, \text{m} \)

- **Triangular Prism on Top:**
  - One side of the triangular base is the same as the width of the rectangular prism (\( 5 \, \text{m} \)).
  - The height of the triangular face is given as \( 3 \, \text{m} \).
  - The hypotenuse of the right triangle forming the slanted face is the same as the length of the rectangular prism (\( 6 \, \text{m} \)).

#### Step 2: Understand What Needs to Be Found
We need to calculate the total surface area of the composite solid. This involves:
1. Surface area of the rectangular prism (excluding the top face, since it is covered by the triangular prism).
2. Surface area of the triangular prism (including its three lateral faces and the triangular bases).

#### Step 3: Calculate the Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism
The rectangular prism has six faces, but we only consider five faces (since the top face is covered by the triangular prism):
- **Two rectangular faces (front and back):**
  \[
  2 \times (l \times h) = 2 \times (6 \times 10) = 120 \, \text{m}^2
  \]
- **Two rectangular faces (left and right):**
  \[
  2 \times (w \times h) = 2 \times (5 \times 10) = 100 \, \text{m}^2
  \]
- **Bottom face:**
  \[
  l \times w = 6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{m}^2
  \]

Thus, the total surface area of the rectangular prism (excluding the top face) is:
\[
120 + 100 + 30 = 250 \, \text{m}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Surface Area of the Triangular Prism
The triangular prism has:
1. Two triangular bases.
2. Three rectangular lateral faces.

##### Step 4.1: Dimensions of the Triangular Base
The triangular base is a right triangle with:
- One leg \( = 5 \, \text{m} \) (same as the width of the rectangular prism).
- Height \( = 3 \, \text{m} \).
- Hypotenuse \( = 6 \, \text{m} \) (given).

Using the Pythagorean theorem to confirm the dimensions:
\[
\text{Hypotenuse} = \sqrt{5^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{25 + 9} = \sqrt{34}
\]
However, the problem states the hypotenuse is \( 6 \, \text{m} \), so we proceed with the given dimensions.

##### Step 4.2: Area of One Triangular Base
The area of one triangular base is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 3 = 7.5 \, \text{m}^2
\]
Since there are two triangular bases, their total area is:
\[
2 \times 7.5 = 15 \, \text{m}^2
\]

##### Step 4.3: Area of the Lateral Faces
The triangular prism has three rectangular lateral faces:
1. **Face corresponding to the \( 5 \, \text{m} \)-long side of the triangle:**
   - Height of the rectangle is the length of the rectangular prism (\( 6 \, \text{m} \)).
   - Width is the same as the \( 5 \, \text{m} \)-long side of the triangle.
   \[
   \text{Area} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

2. **Face corresponding to the \( 3 \, \text{m} \)-high side of the triangle:**
   - Height of the rectangle is the length of the rectangular prism (\( 6 \, \text{m} \)).
   - Width is the same as the \( 3 \, \text{m} \)-high side of the triangle.
   \[
   \text{Area} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

3. **Face corresponding to the hypotenuse (\( 6 \, \text{m} \)):**
   - Height of the rectangle is the length of the rectangular prism (\( 6 \, \text{m} \)).
   - Width is the same as the hypotenuse (\( 6 \, \text{m} \)).
   \[
   \text{Area} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \, \text{m}^2
   \]

The total area of the three lateral faces is:
\[
30 + 18 + 36 = 84 \, \text{m}^2
\]

##### Step 4.4: Total Surface Area of the Triangular Prism
The total surface area of the triangular prism is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the three lateral faces:
\[
15 + 84 = 99 \, \text{m}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Total Surface Area of the Composite Solid
The total surface area of the composite solid is the sum of the surface area of the rectangular prism (excluding the top face) and the surface area of the triangular prism:
\[
250 + 99 = 349 \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{349.00}
\]
