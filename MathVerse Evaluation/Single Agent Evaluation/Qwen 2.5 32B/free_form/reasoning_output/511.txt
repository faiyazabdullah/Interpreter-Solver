QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is 6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a shaded region in the coordinate plane. The boundary of the shaded region is a dashed line. We are given the following information:
- The x-intercept of the line is \(-3\).
- The y-intercept of the line is \(6\).

We need to determine the inequality that describes the shaded region.

---

### Step 1: Determine the Equation of the Line
The equation of a line can be written in slope-intercept form:
\[ y = mx + b \]
where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

#### Find the Slope (\(m\)):
The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Using the x-intercept \((-3, 0)\) and the y-intercept \((0, 6)\):
\[ m = \frac{6 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \]

#### Write the Equation of the Line:
The y-intercept \(b\) is given as \(6\). Substituting \(m = 2\) and \(b = 6\) into the slope-intercept form:
\[ y = 2x + 6 \]

---

### Step 2: Determine the Inequality
The shaded region is below the dashed line \(y = 2x + 6\). This means the inequality describing the shaded region is:
\[ y < 2x + 6 \]

---

### Step 3: Verify the Shaded Region
From the graph:
- The dashed line indicates that the inequality is strict (\(<\)) rather than non-strict (\(\leq\)).
- The shaded region is below the line, confirming that the inequality is \(y < 2x + 6\).

---

### Final Answer:
The inequality that describes the shaded region is:
\[ \boxed{y < 2x + 6} \]
