QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 45Â°, the lengths of the two right angled edges are 4*sqrt{3} and y respectively, and the diagonal side has a length of x. Consider the adjacent figure:


Solve for the exact value of x.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a right triangle with the following details:
- One of the non-right angles is \(45^\circ\).
- The lengths of the two legs of the triangle are \(4\sqrt{3}\) and \(y\).
- The hypotenuse is labeled as \(x\).

Since one of the non-right angles is \(45^\circ\), this indicates that the triangle is a **45-45-90 triangle**, which has specific properties:
1. The two legs are congruent.
2. The hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of each leg.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the relationship between the legs
In a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs are equal. Therefore, we have:
\[ y = 4\sqrt{3} \]

#### Step 2: Use the property of the hypotenuse
In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse \(x\) is given by:
\[ x = \sqrt{2} \times \text{(length of a leg)} \]

Since one leg is \(4\sqrt{3}\), we substitute this into the formula:
\[ x = \sqrt{2} \times 4\sqrt{3} \]

#### Step 3: Simplify the expression
\[ x = 4\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{3} \]
\[ x = 4\sqrt{6} \]

### Final Answer:
The exact value of \(x\) is:
\[ \boxed{4\sqrt{6}} \]
