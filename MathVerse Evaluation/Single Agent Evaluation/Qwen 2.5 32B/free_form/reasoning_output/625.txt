QUESTION:
A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to determine the largest possible ellipse that can fit inside a rectangular box with dimensions \(40 \, \text{cm}\) by \(20 \, \text{cm}\). The vertices of the rectangle are given as \((0, 0)\), \((0, 20)\), \((40, 20)\), and \((40, 0)\). We need to find the coordinates of the center of this ellipse.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- The rectangle is defined by its vertices: \((0, 0)\), \((0, 20)\), \((40, 20)\), and \((40, 0)\).
- The largest ellipse that fits inside this rectangle will have its major axis equal to the length of the rectangle (\(40 \, \text{cm}\)) and its minor axis equal to the width of the rectangle (\(20 \, \text{cm}\)).
- The center of the ellipse will coincide with the center of the rectangle, as the ellipse must be symmetrically placed inside the rectangle to maximize its size.

#### Step 2: Finding the Center of the Rectangle
The center of a rectangle is the midpoint of its diagonals. To find the center:
- The midpoint formula for two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
  \[
  \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)
  \]
- Using the vertices \((0, 0)\) and \((40, 20)\):
  \[
  \left( \frac{0 + 40}{2}, \frac{0 + 20}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{40}{2}, \frac{20}{2} \right) = (20, 10)
  \]

#### Step 3: Verifying the Ellipse's Position
- The largest ellipse that fits inside the rectangle will have its major axis along the length of the rectangle (40 cm) and its minor axis along the width of the rectangle (20 cm).
- The center of this ellipse must be at the center of the rectangle to ensure symmetry and maximize the size of the ellipse.
- Therefore, the coordinates of the center of the ellipse are \((20, 10)\).

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The coordinates of the center of the cake (ellipse) are \((20, 10)\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(20, 10)}
\]
