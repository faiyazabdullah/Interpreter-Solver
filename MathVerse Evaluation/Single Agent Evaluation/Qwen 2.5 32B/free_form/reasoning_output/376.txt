QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 45^\circ, one leg measuring 4\sqrt{3}. Consider the adjacent figure:Solve for the exact value of y.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a right-angled triangle with one of the acute angles measuring \(45^\circ\). This indicates that the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle, which has specific properties:
- The two legs are congruent.
- The hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of each leg.

From the image:
- One leg of the triangle is given as \(4\sqrt{3}\).
- The other leg, denoted as \(y\), is unknown.
- The hypotenuse, denoted as \(x\), is also unknown but can be derived if necessary.

We need to solve for \(y\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the properties of a 45-45-90 triangle
In a 45-45-90 triangle:
1. The two legs are equal in length.
2. If one leg is \(a\), the other leg is also \(a\).
3. The hypotenuse is \(a\sqrt{2}\).

#### Step 2: Apply the property of equal legs
Since the given leg is \(4\sqrt{3}\), the other leg \(y\) must also be equal to \(4\sqrt{3}\).

Thus:
\[ y = 4\sqrt{3} \]

#### Step 3: Verify the solution
The properties of the 45-45-90 triangle confirm that both legs are equal. Therefore, the value of \(y\) is indeed \(4\sqrt{3}\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4\sqrt{3}}
\]
