QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 30^\circ, one leg measuring \sqrt{10}.Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the exact value of x.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for the exact value of \( x \) in the given right-angled triangle, let's follow the solution steps systematically.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The triangle is a right-angled triangle.
- One of the acute angles is \( 30^\circ \).
- The hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{10} \).
- We need to find the length of the side adjacent to the \( 30^\circ \) angle, which is labeled as \( x \).

### Step 2: Identify the relationship between the sides
In a right-angled triangle with a \( 30^\circ \)-\( 60^\circ \)-\( 90^\circ \) configuration:
- The side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle is half the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the \( 60^\circ \) angle is \( \sqrt{3} \) times the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

However, we can also use trigonometric relationships since the hypotenuse and one angle are known:
- The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as:
  \[
  \cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent side}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
  \]
  Here, \( \theta = 30^\circ \), the adjacent side is \( x \), and the hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{10} \).

### Step 3: Apply the cosine formula
Using the cosine formula:
\[
\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{10}}
\]
We know that:
\[
\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{10}}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by \( \sqrt{10} \):
\[
x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{10}
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
x = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{10}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{30}}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Verify the solution
The value \( x = \frac{\sqrt{30}}{2} \) satisfies the cosine relationship and the properties of the right-angled triangle. Therefore, it is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{30}}{2}}
\]
