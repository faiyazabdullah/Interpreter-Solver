QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function going through points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's carefully analyze the given information and follow the steps systematically.

### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image provided shows a piecewise linear function plotted on a coordinate grid. The function passes through specific points:
- Point 1: \((-3, 0)\)
- Point 2: \((0, 5)\)
- Point 3: \((3, 5)\)

From the graph, we observe:
1. The function is linear between each pair of consecutive points.
2. The function changes behavior at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 3\).

### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
The function is defined as a piecewise function, meaning it has different rules for different intervals of \(x\). Based on the graph:
- For \(x \leq 0\), the function starts at \((-3, 0)\) and ends at \((0, 5)\).
- For \(0 < x \leq 3\), the function remains constant at \(y = 5\).
- For \(x > 3\), the function continues from \((3, 5)\) and increases linearly.

### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine the **domain** and **range** of the function. The domain is the set of all possible \(x\)-values, and the range is the set of all possible \(y\)-values.

### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems, Properties, and Formulas
#### Domain:
The domain of a function is the set of all \(x\)-values for which the function is defined. From the graph:
- The function starts at \(x = -3\) and extends indefinitely to the right (\(x > 3\)).
- There are no restrictions on the left side beyond \(x = -3\), and the function continues indefinitely on the right.

Thus, the domain is:
\[
[-3, \infty)
\]

#### Range:
The range of a function is the set of all \(y\)-values that the function can take. From the graph:
- The lowest \(y\)-value occurs at \((-3, 0)\), so the minimum value of \(y\) is 0.
- The function remains at \(y = 5\) for \(0 < x \leq 3\).
- For \(x > 3\), the function increases linearly beyond \(y = 5\).

Thus, the range is:
\[
[0, \infty)
\]

### Step 5: Show All Calculations Clearly
- **Domain**: The function is defined for all \(x \geq -3\), so the domain is \([-3, \infty)\).
- **Range**: The function takes values starting from \(y = 0\) and extends upwards indefinitely, so the range is \([0, \infty)\).

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{[-3, \infty), [0, \infty)}
\]
