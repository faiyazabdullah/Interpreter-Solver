QUESTION:
Given the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at 9 and -9 and with y-axis at 3 and -3, determine its equation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows an ellipse centered at the origin \((0, 0)\). The ellipse intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 0)\), and it intersects the \(y\)-axis at \((0, 3)\) and \((0, -3)\).

#### Step 1: Identify Key Information
- The ellipse is symmetric about both the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis.
- The points of intersection with the \(x\)-axis are \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 0)\), indicating the semi-major axis length along the \(x\)-direction is \(a = 9\).
- The points of intersection with the \(y\)-axis are \((0, 3)\) and \((0, -3)\), indicating the semi-minor axis length along the \(y\)-direction is \(b = 3\).

#### Step 2: Standard Equation of an Ellipse
The standard form of the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a horizontal major axis is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
where:
- \(a\) is the length of the semi-major axis,
- \(b\) is the length of the semi-minor axis.

#### Step 3: Substitute Known Values
From the problem:
- \(a = 9\),
- \(b = 3\).

Substitute these values into the standard equation:
\[
\frac{x^2}{9^2} + \frac{y^2}{3^2} = 1
\]
Simplify the denominators:
\[
\frac{x^2}{81} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Equation
The equation \(\frac{x^2}{81} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1\) satisfies the conditions of the problem:
- When \(y = 0\), the equation becomes \(\frac{x^2}{81} = 1\), giving \(x = \pm 9\), which matches the \(x\)-intercepts.
- When \(x = 0\), the equation becomes \(\frac{y^2}{9} = 1\), giving \(y = \pm 3\), which matches the \(y\)-intercepts.

Thus, the equation is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{x^2}{81} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1}
\]
