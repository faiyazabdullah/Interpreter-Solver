### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a composite solid consisting of three rectangular prisms stacked on top of each other. The problem states that the seven marked edges have the same length, and the total height of the prism is 16 cm. We need to find the volume of the composite solid.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The seven marked edges have the same length. Let this common length be \( x \).
- The total height of the prism is 16 cm.
- The base dimensions of the largest rectangle are given as 7 cm (width) and 16 cm (height).

#### Step 2: Understand the structure
The figure consists of three rectangular prisms:
1. The bottommost prism has a base dimension of \( 7 \times x \) and a height of \( x \).
2. The middle prism has a base dimension of \( x \times x \) and a height of \( x \).
3. The topmost prism has a base dimension of \( x \times x \) and a height of \( x \).

#### Step 3: Relate the total height to the common edge length
The total height of the prism is the sum of the heights of the three smaller prisms:
\[
x + x + x = 16 \implies 3x = 16 \implies x = \frac{16}{3} \text{ cm}.
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the volume of each rectangular prism
The volume of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}.
\]

1. **Bottommost prism**:
   - Base dimensions: \( 7 \times x \)
   - Height: \( x \)
   - Volume:
     \[
     V_1 = 7 \times x \times x = 7x^2.
     \]

2. **Middle prism**:
   - Base dimensions: \( x \times x \)
   - Height: \( x \)
   - Volume:
     \[
     V_2 = x \times x \times x = x^3.
     \]

3. **Topmost prism**:
   - Base dimensions: \( x \times x \)
   - Height: \( x \)
   - Volume:
     \[
     V_3 = x \times x \times x = x^3.
     \]

#### Step 5: Total volume of the composite solid
The total volume \( V \) is the sum of the volumes of the three prisms:
\[
V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 = 7x^2 + x^3 + x^3 = 7x^2 + 2x^3.
\]

Substitute \( x = \frac{16}{3} \):
\[
V = 7\left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^2 + 2\left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^3.
\]

Calculate \( \left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^2 \):
\[
\left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{256}{9}.
\]

Calculate \( \left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^3 \):
\[
\left(\frac{16}{3}\right)^3 = \frac{4096}{27}.
\]

Now substitute these values into the volume formula:
\[
V = 7 \cdot \frac{256}{9} + 2 \cdot \frac{4096}{27}.
\]

Simplify each term:
\[
7 \cdot \frac{256}{9} = \frac{1792}{9},
\]
\[
2 \cdot \frac{4096}{27} = \frac{8192}{27}.
\]

To add these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9 and 27 is 27:
\[
\frac{1792}{9} = \frac{1792 \cdot 3}{9 \cdot 3} = \frac{5376}{27}.
\]

Now add the fractions:
\[
V = \frac{5376}{27} + \frac{8192}{27} = \frac{5376 + 8192}{27} = \frac{13568}{27}.
\]

#### Step 6: Final Answer
The volume of the composite solid is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{13568}{27} \text{ cm}^3}.
\]
