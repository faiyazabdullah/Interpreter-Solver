QUESTION:
Calculate the volume of the solid. Assume that the solid is a quarter of a cylinder. The height is 15 cm and radius is 7 cm.

Round your answer to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure represents a quarter of a cylinder. We are tasked with calculating the volume of this solid. The dimensions provided are:
- Radius of the base of the cylinder: \( r = 7 \) cm
- Height of the cylinder: \( h = 15 \) cm

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the geometry of the solid**
The solid is a quarter of a cylinder. This means it is one-fourth of a full cylinder. To find its volume, we first calculate the volume of the full cylinder and then take one-fourth of that volume.

#### **Step 2: Formula for the volume of a cylinder**
The volume \( V \) of a full cylinder is given by:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

#### **Step 3: Substitute the given values**
Here, \( r = 7 \) cm and \( h = 15 \) cm. Substituting these values into the formula:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (7)^2 (15)
\]
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (49)(15)
\]
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = 735\pi \quad \text{(volume of the full cylinder)}
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the volume of the quarter cylinder**
Since the solid is a quarter of the cylinder, its volume is one-fourth of the volume of the full cylinder:
\[
V_{\text{quarter cylinder}} = \frac{1}{4} V_{\text{cylinder}}
\]
\[
V_{\text{quarter cylinder}} = \frac{1}{4} (735\pi)
\]
\[
V_{\text{quarter cylinder}} = 183.75\pi
\]

#### **Step 5: Approximate the value**
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
V_{\text{quarter cylinder}} \approx 183.75 \times 3.14159
\]
\[
V_{\text{quarter cylinder}} \approx 576.99
\]

#### **Step 6: Round to one decimal place**
Rounding \( 576.99 \) to one decimal place gives:
\[
V_{\text{quarter cylinder}} \approx 577.0
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{577.0 \text{ cm}^3}
\]
