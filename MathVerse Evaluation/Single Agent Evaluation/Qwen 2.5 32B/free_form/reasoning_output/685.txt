QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length \( L \) of the longest straw that can fit entirely inside a cylindrical soft drink can. The can has:
- Height \( h = 13 \) cm
- Radius \( r = 3 \) cm

The longest straw will span from one point on the bottom circular base of the cylinder to the opposite point on the top circular base. This forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle where:
- One leg is the height of the cylinder (\( h = 13 \) cm).
- The other leg is the diameter of the base of the cylinder (\( 2r = 2 \times 3 = 6 \) cm).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify the Geometric Configuration:
The longest straw corresponds to the diagonal of a rectangle formed by:
- The height of the cylinder (\( h = 13 \) cm).
- The diameter of the base of the cylinder (\( 2r = 6 \) cm).

This diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of lengths 13 cm and 6 cm.

#### 2. Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:
The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
L = \sqrt{(2r)^2 + h^2}
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
L = \sqrt{6^2 + 13^2}
\]

#### 3. Calculate Each Term:
\[
6^2 = 36
\]
\[
13^2 = 169
\]

#### 4. Sum the Squares:
\[
6^2 + 13^2 = 36 + 169 = 205
\]

#### 5. Take the Square Root:
\[
L = \sqrt{205}
\]

#### 6. Approximate the Result:
Using a calculator:
\[
\sqrt{205} \approx 14.3178
\]

#### 7. Round Down to the Nearest Integer:
Since the straw must fit entirely inside the can without bending, we round down to ensure it fits:
\[
L \approx 14 \text{ cm}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
