QUESTION:
A figure with a radius of $ 11 \mathrm{~m}$. Find the area of the shape shown.

Give your answer as an exact value.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure consists of a quarter-circle with a radius of \(11 \, \mathrm{m}\). The shaded region is the part of the quarter-circle that excludes a smaller square. We need to find the area of the entire shaded region.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Radius of the circle: \( r = 11 \, \mathrm{m} \).
- The shaded region is a quarter-circle minus a square.

#### Step 2: Calculate the area of the quarter-circle
The area of a full circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of full circle} = \pi r^2
\]
Since we have a quarter-circle, its area is:
\[
\text{Area of quarter-circle} = \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi (11)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi (121) = \frac{121\pi}{4}
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the side length of the square
The square is inscribed in such a way that one of its corners is at the center of the circle, and one of its sides lies along the radius of the circle. The side length of the square is equal to the radius of the circle, which is \(11 \, \mathrm{m}\).

#### Step 4: Calculate the area of the square
The area of the square is:
\[
\text{Area of square} = \text{side}^2 = 11^2 = 121
\]

#### Step 5: Subtract the area of the square from the area of the quarter-circle
The area of the shaded region is the area of the quarter-circle minus the area of the square:
\[
\text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of quarter-circle} - \text{Area of square} = \frac{121\pi}{4} - 121
\]

#### Step 6: Write the final answer
The area of the shaded region is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{121\pi}{4} - 121}
\]
