QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves analyzing a graph that depicts the recall percentages of two individuals, Maximilian and Lucy, over time. The goal is to determine the percentage of content Lucy forgets each day, given her recall pattern.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Graph
- The **y-axis** represents the "recall percentage," starting at 100%.
- The **x-axis** represents the number of "days."
- There are two curves:
  - The **gray curve** represents Maximilian's recall.
  - The **black curve** represents Lucy's recall.
- Both curves start at 100% on Day 0 and decrease over time, indicating forgetting.

#### Step 2: Maximilian's Recall Pattern
From the problem statement:
- Maximilian forgets **15% of what he could recount the day before** each day.
- Mathematically, if \( R_m(t) \) is Maximilian's recall percentage on day \( t \), then:
  \[
  R_m(t+1) = R_m(t) \times (1 - 0.15) = R_m(t) \times 0.85
  \]
- This is an exponential decay model: \( R_m(t) = 100 \times (0.85)^t \).

#### Step 3: Lucy's Recall Pattern
The black curve represents Lucy's recall. We need to determine the rate at which Lucy forgets content each day. Let:
- \( R_l(t) \) be Lucy's recall percentage on day \( t \).
- \( r \) be the fraction of content Lucy retains each day. Then:
  \[
  R_l(t+1) = R_l(t) \times r
  \]
- The goal is to find \( r \) and subsequently the percentage of content Lucy forgets each day, which is \( 1 - r \).

#### Step 4: Extracting Data from the Graph
To determine \( r \), we need to analyze the shape of Lucy's recall curve (black curve). While the exact numerical values are not provided, we can infer the following:
1. On Day 0, \( R_l(0) = 100 \).
2. As time progresses, the recall percentage decreases exponentially.
3. The rate of decrease can be estimated by comparing points on the curve.

#### Step 5: Fitting Lucy's Recall Curve
Assume we have two points on Lucy's curve:
- On Day 0: \( R_l(0) = 100 \).
- On Day 1: \( R_l(1) = x \) (some value less than 100).

From the exponential decay model:
\[
R_l(1) = R_l(0) \times r = 100 \times r
\]
Thus:
\[
r = \frac{R_l(1)}{100}
\]

#### Step 6: Estimating \( r \) from the Graph
By visually inspecting the graph:
- On Day 0, Lucy's recall is 100%.
- On Day 1, Lucy's recall appears to be approximately 85% (this is an estimate based on the graph's slope and shape).

Using this estimate:
\[
r = \frac{85}{100} = 0.85
\]

#### Step 7: Calculating the Percentage Forgotten
The percentage of content Lucy forgets each day is:
\[
1 - r = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 = 15\%
\]

#### Step 8: Verifying the Solution
The solution matches the form of an exponential decay model, consistent with the shape of the black curve in the graph. Lucy's recall pattern is similar to Maximilian's, suggesting a consistent forgetting rate.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{15\%}
\]
