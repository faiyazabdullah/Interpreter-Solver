QUESTION:
Find the surface area of this prism. The prism consists of 10 different rectangles with edges. The thickness of the prism is 3cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the surface area of the given prism, we will follow the solution steps systematically.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the geometric figure and identify given information
The prism has a complex shape composed of several rectangular faces. The dimensions provided are:
- Length of the base rectangle: \(17 \, \text{cm}\)
- Height of the base rectangle: \(16 \, \text{cm}\)
- Thickness (height of the prism): \(3 \, \text{cm}\)
- Additional details from the diagram:
  - A protruding section at the top right with dimensions \(4 \, \text{cm}\) (width) and \(8 \, \text{cm}\) (length).

The prism consists of 10 different rectangles, and we need to calculate the surface area by summing the areas of all these rectangles.

---

### Step 2: Break down the surface area into individual faces
The surface area of the prism can be divided into the following components:
1. **Top face**: A rectangle with dimensions \(17 \, \text{cm}\) and \(16 \, \text{cm}\).
2. **Bottom face**: Identical to the top face.
3. **Front face**: A rectangle with dimensions \(16 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
4. **Back face**: Identical to the front face.
5. **Left side face**: A rectangle with dimensions \(17 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
6. **Right side face**: A composite shape consisting of two rectangles:
   - One rectangle with dimensions \(8 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
   - Another rectangle with dimensions \(9 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\) (since \(17 - 8 = 9\)).

---

### Step 3: Calculate the area of each face

#### Top and Bottom Faces
Both the top and bottom faces are identical rectangles with dimensions \(17 \, \text{cm}\) and \(16 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
\text{Area of one face} = 17 \times 16 = 272 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Since there are two such faces (top and bottom):
\[
\text{Total area of top and bottom faces} = 2 \times 272 = 544 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Front and Back Faces
Both the front and back faces are identical rectangles with dimensions \(16 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
\text{Area of one face} = 16 \times 3 = 48 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Since there are two such faces (front and back):
\[
\text{Total area of front and back faces} = 2 \times 48 = 96 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Left Side Face
The left side face is a rectangle with dimensions \(17 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
\text{Area of left side face} = 17 \times 3 = 51 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Right Side Face
The right side face is composed of two rectangles:
1. A rectangle with dimensions \(8 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\):
   \[
   \text{Area of first rectangle} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
2. A rectangle with dimensions \(9 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\):
   \[
   \text{Area of second rectangle} = 9 \times 3 = 27 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
The total area of the right side face is:
\[
\text{Total area of right side face} = 24 + 27 = 51 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 4: Sum the areas of all faces
Now, we sum the areas of all the faces:
\[
\text{Total surface area} = \text{Top and bottom faces} + \text{Front and back faces} + \text{Left side face} + \text{Right side face}
\]
\[
\text{Total surface area} = 544 + 96 + 51 + 51 = 742 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{742}
\]
