QUESTION:
A farmer wants to build a fence around the entire perimeter of his land, as shown in the diagram. The fencing costs £37 per metre. the lengths of EF and CD are x metre and y metre.
At £37 per metre of fencing, how much will it cost him to build the fence along the entire perimeter of the land?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Figure and Identify Given Information**
The figure shows a complex geometric shape composed of rectangles, right triangles, and segments. Here are the key observations and given measurements:
- \( AB = 5 \, \text{m} \)
- \( BC = 3 \, \text{m} \)
- \( CD = y \, \text{m} \)
- \( DE = 2 \, \text{m} \)
- \( AF = 1 \, \text{m} \)
- \( EF = x \, \text{m} \)

We need to calculate the total perimeter of the land and then determine the cost of building the fence at £37 per meter.

---

#### **Step 2: Break Down the Perimeter into Known and Unknown Segments**
The perimeter of the land consists of the following segments:
1. \( AB \)
2. \( BC \)
3. \( CD \)
4. \( DE \)
5. \( EF \)
6. \( FA \)

From the diagram:
- \( AB = 5 \, \text{m} \)
- \( BC = 3 \, \text{m} \)
- \( DE = 2 \, \text{m} \)
- \( FA = 1 \, \text{m} \)

The remaining segments \( CD \) and \( EF \) are unknown and need to be determined.

---

#### **Step 3: Determine \( CD \) and \( EF \) Using Geometry**
##### **Finding \( CD \):**
The segment \( CD \) is part of a larger rectangle formed by extending the vertical sides. From the diagram:
- \( CD = AF + AB = 1 \, \text{m} + 5 \, \text{m} = 6 \, \text{m} \).

Thus, \( y = 6 \, \text{m} \).

##### **Finding \( EF \):**
The segment \( EF \) forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle \( \triangle EFG \). From the diagram:
- The horizontal leg \( GE = DE = 2 \, \text{m} \).
- The vertical leg \( FG = AB - AG = AB - (BC - BG) \).

Since \( BG = 1 \, \text{m} \) (as \( AF = 1 \, \text{m} \)), we have:
\[ AG = BC - BG = 3 \, \text{m} - 1 \, \text{m} = 2 \, \text{m} \]
\[ FG = AB - AG = 5 \, \text{m} - 2 \, \text{m} = 3 \, \text{m} \]

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle EFG \):
\[ EF = \sqrt{GE^2 + FG^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13} \, \text{m} \]

Thus, \( x = \sqrt{13} \, \text{m} \).

---

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Perimeter**
The total perimeter \( P \) of the land is the sum of all its sides:
\[ P = AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA \]
Substitute the known values:
\[ P = 5 + 3 + 6 + 2 + \sqrt{13} + 1 \]
\[ P = 17 + \sqrt{13} \, \text{m} \]

---

#### **Step 5: Calculate the Cost of Fencing**
The cost of fencing is £37 per meter. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) is:
\[ C = 37 \times P \]
\[ C = 37 \times (17 + \sqrt{13}) \]
\[ C = 37 \times 17 + 37 \times \sqrt{13} \]
\[ C = 629 + 37\sqrt{13} \]

---

#### **Final Answer:**
The total cost to build the fence is:
\[ \boxed{629 + 37\sqrt{13}} \]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $629 + 37\sqrt{13}$
