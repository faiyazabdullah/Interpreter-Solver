### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a piecewise linear function represented by a graph. The function is composed of straight-line segments passing through specific points: $(-3, -2)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(-1, 0)$. We need to determine the equations of these line segments and write them as a piecewise function.

#### Step 1: Identify the segments and their endpoints
From the graph, we observe two distinct line segments:
1. **Segment 1**: From $(-3, -2)$ to $(-1, 0)$.
2. **Segment 2**: From $(-1, 0)$ to $(0, 1)$.

#### Step 2: Find the equation of Segment 1
The endpoints of Segment 1 are $(-3, -2)$ and $(-1, 0)$.

##### Slope of Segment 1:
The slope $m_1$ is calculated using the formula:
\[
m_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - (-2)}{-1 - (-3)} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
\]

##### Equation of Segment 1:
Using the point-slope form of the line equation $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, we choose the point $(-3, -2)$:
\[
y - (-2) = 1(x - (-3)) \implies y + 2 = x + 3 \implies y = x + 1
\]

This segment is valid for $x \in [-3, -1]$.

#### Step 3: Find the equation of Segment 2
The endpoints of Segment 2 are $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$.

##### Slope of Segment 2:
The slope $m_2$ is calculated using the formula:
\[
m_2 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{1 - 0}{0 - (-1)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

##### Equation of Segment 2:
Using the point-slope form of the line equation $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, we choose the point $(-1, 0)$:
\[
y - 0 = 1(x - (-1)) \implies y = x + 1
\]

This segment is valid for $x \in [-1, 0]$.

#### Step 4: Combine the segments into a piecewise function
From the above calculations, we observe that both segments have the same equation $y = x + 1$. However, they are defined over different intervals:
- For $x \in [-3, -1]$, the equation is $y = x + 1$.
- For $x \in [-1, 0]$, the equation is also $y = x + 1$.

Since the function is continuous at $x = -1$, we can combine these into a single equation for the interval $x \in [-3, 0]$:
\[
f(x) = x + 1 \quad \text{for } x \in [-3, 0].
\]

#### Step 5: Extend the function to the rest of the graph
From the graph, we observe that the function continues as a straight line with the same slope ($m = 1$) beyond $x = 0$. Therefore, the equation remains $y = x + 1$ for all $x \geq 0$.

Combining all segments, the piecewise function is:
\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
x + 1 & \text{if } x \leq 0 \\
x + 1 & \text{if } x > 0 
\end{cases}
\]

Since the function is consistent across all intervals, it simplifies to:
\[
f(x) = x + 1 \quad \text{for all } x.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{f(x) = x + 1}
\]
