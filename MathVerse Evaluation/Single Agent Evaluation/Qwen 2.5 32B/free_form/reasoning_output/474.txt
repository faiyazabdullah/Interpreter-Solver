QUESTION:
There are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a number line with two points marked at -2 and -1. These points are open circles, indicating that the values -2 and -1 are **not included** in the set of numbers represented on the number line. The line extends indefinitely in both directions, suggesting that the set includes all real numbers between -2 and -1, excluding these endpoints.

### Solution Steps:

1. **Identify the Points and Their Nature**:
   - The points are located at -2 and -1.
   - Both points are marked with open circles, which means they are **excluded** from the set.

2. **Understand the Interval**:
   - Since the points are excluded, the interval is **open** at both ends.
   - The interval includes all real numbers strictly greater than -2 and strictly less than -1.

3. **Express the Interval in Interval Notation**:
   - In interval notation, an open interval is denoted using parentheses `( )`.
   - The interval from -2 to -1, excluding the endpoints, is written as `(-2, -1)`.

4. **Verify the Representation**:
   - The number line confirms that no values at -2 or -1 are part of the set, aligning with the open-circle notation.
   - All numbers between -2 and -1 are included, as indicated by the line segment connecting the two points.

### Final Answer:
The set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation is:
\[
\boxed{(-2, -1)}
\]
