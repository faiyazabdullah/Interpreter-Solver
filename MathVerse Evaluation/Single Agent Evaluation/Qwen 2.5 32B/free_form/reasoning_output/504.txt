QUESTION:
There is a U-shape curve opens upwards and passes (0,0). Determine whether the graphed function is even, odd, or neither.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a parabolic curve that opens upwards. The curve passes through the origin \((0, 0)\) and is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis. The curve extends infinitely in both positive and negative \(x\)-directions, approaching infinity as \(|x|\) increases.

#### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
- The curve is a parabola, which is a quadratic function of the form \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\).
- The symmetry about the \(y\)-axis suggests that the function is even because even functions satisfy the property \(f(-x) = f(x)\).
- The curve passes through the origin, so the point \((0, 0)\) is on the graph. This implies that the constant term \(c = 0\) in the quadratic equation.

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine whether the graphed function is even, odd, or neither. To do this, we analyze the symmetry properties of the function.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties
- **Even Function**: A function \(f(x)\) is even if \(f(-x) = f(x)\) for all \(x\) in its domain. Even functions are symmetric about the \(y\)-axis.
- **Odd Function**: A function \(f(x)\) is odd if \(f(-x) = -f(x)\) for all \(x\) in its domain. Odd functions are symmetric about the origin.
- **Neither**: If a function does not satisfy the conditions for being even or odd, it is neither.

From the image:
- The curve is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis. This means that for every point \((x, y)\) on the curve, the point \((-x, y)\) is also on the curve. This is the defining property of an even function.

#### Step 5: Show Calculations Clearly
Since the function is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis, we can infer that the function is of the form \(y = ax^2\), where \(a\) is a constant. This form satisfies the condition \(f(-x) = f(x)\):
\[
f(x) = ax^2 \quad \text{and} \quad f(-x) = a(-x)^2 = ax^2.
\]
Thus, \(f(-x) = f(x)\), confirming that the function is even.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{even}}
\]
