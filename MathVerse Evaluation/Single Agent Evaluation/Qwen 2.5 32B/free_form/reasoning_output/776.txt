QUESTION:
In the figure above. The graph consists of four lines l,m,n,p intersecting each other. Line l and line p are perpendicular. If the angle (not shown) where lines n and p intersect is twice as large as the angle (also not shown) where lines l and m intersect, what is the value of x?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- Line \( l \) and line \( p \) are perpendicular. Therefore, the angle between them is \( 90^\circ \).
- The angle where lines \( n \) and \( p \) intersect is \( 110^\circ \).
- The angle where lines \( l \) and \( m \) intersect is denoted as \( x^\circ \).
- The problem states that the angle where lines \( n \) and \( p \) intersect is twice the angle where lines \( l \) and \( m \) intersect. Thus, we have the relationship:
  \[
  110^\circ = 2x
  \]

#### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)
From the relationship \( 110^\circ = 2x \), we solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{110^\circ}{2} = 55^\circ
\]

#### Step 3: Verify Consistency with Geometric Relationships
- Since line \( l \) and line \( p \) are perpendicular, the angle between them is \( 90^\circ \). This does not affect the calculation of \( x \) directly but confirms the perpendicularity condition.
- The angle where lines \( n \) and \( p \) intersect is given as \( 110^\circ \), which is consistent with the problem statement.
- The relationship \( 110^\circ = 2x \) holds true, and solving it gives \( x = 55^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The value of \( x \) is \( 55^\circ \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{55^\circ}\]
