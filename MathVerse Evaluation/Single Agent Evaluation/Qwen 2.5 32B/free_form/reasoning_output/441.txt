QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\sin a$.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the value of $\sin a$, where the angle $a$ is in standard position, and its terminal side intersects the unit circle at the point $P\left(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin, and the radius is 1.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
- The point $P\left(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)$ lies on the unit circle. This means the coordinates of $P$ satisfy the equation of the unit circle:
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = 1
  \]
  Substituting $x = \frac{3}{5}$ and $y = \frac{4}{5}$:
  \[
  \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{4}{5}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{25} + \frac{16}{25} = \frac{25}{25} = 1
  \]
  Thus, the point $P$ indeed lies on the unit circle.

- The angle $a$ is in standard position, meaning its initial side lies along the positive $x$-axis, and its terminal side passes through the point $P$.

#### Step 2: Recall the Definition of Sine
The sine of an angle in standard position is defined as the $y$-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle. Mathematically:
\[
\sin a = y
\]
where $(x, y)$ are the coordinates of the point on the unit circle.

#### Step 3: Identify the Coordinates of $P$
From the problem, the coordinates of $P$ are:
\[
P\left(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)
\]
Thus, the $y$-coordinate of $P$ is $\frac{4}{5}$.

#### Step 4: Calculate $\sin a$
Since the $y$-coordinate of $P$ is $\frac{4}{5}$, we have:
\[
\sin a = \frac{4}{5}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{4}{5}}
\]
