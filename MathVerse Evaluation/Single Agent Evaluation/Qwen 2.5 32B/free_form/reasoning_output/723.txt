QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the cylindrical water tank is 3x and the radius of its base is 5x+3. The cylindrical water tank is leaking at a constant rate of 3\pi x litres per second (where x is a fixed unknown). If the water tank was initially full, calculate the amount of water remaining after \left(2x+2\right)^2 seconds. Give your simplified answer in expanded form.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
From the image and the problem statement:
- The height of the cylindrical water tank is \(3x\).
- The radius of the base of the cylinder is \(5x + 3\).
- The tank is leaking water at a constant rate of \(3\pi x\) litres per second.
- The initial volume of water in the tank is equal to the volume of the cylinder.
- We need to calculate the amount of water remaining after \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Initial Volume of the Cylinder
The formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
Here:
- The radius \(r = 5x + 3\),
- The height \(h = 3x\).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
V = \pi (5x + 3)^2 (3x)
\]

First, expand \((5x + 3)^2\):
\[
(5x + 3)^2 = (5x)^2 + 2(5x)(3) + 3^2 = 25x^2 + 30x + 9
\]

Now multiply by \(3x\):
\[
V = \pi (25x^2 + 30x + 9)(3x)
\]
\[
V = \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x)
\]

Thus, the initial volume of the cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x)
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the Amount of Water Leaked
The tank leaks water at a constant rate of \(3\pi x\) litres per second. The time elapsed is \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds. Therefore, the total amount of water leaked is:
\[
\text{Water leaked} = \text{Leak rate} \times \text{Time}
\]
\[
\text{Water leaked} = 3\pi x \cdot (2x + 2)^2
\]

First, expand \((2x + 2)^2\):
\[
(2x + 2)^2 = (2x)^2 + 2(2x)(2) + 2^2 = 4x^2 + 8x + 4
\]

Now multiply by \(3\pi x\):
\[
\text{Water leaked} = 3\pi x (4x^2 + 8x + 4)
\]
\[
\text{Water leaked} = 3\pi x \cdot 4x^2 + 3\pi x \cdot 8x + 3\pi x \cdot 4
\]
\[
\text{Water leaked} = 12\pi x^3 + 24\pi x^2 + 12\pi x
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Remaining Water
The amount of water remaining in the tank after \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds is the initial volume minus the volume of water leaked:
\[
\text{Remaining water} = \text{Initial volume} - \text{Water leaked}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining water} = \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x) - (12\pi x^3 + 24\pi x^2 + 12\pi x)
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
\text{Remaining water} = \pi (75x^3 - 12x^3) + \pi (90x^2 - 24x^2) + \pi (27x - 12x)
\]
\[
\text{Remaining water} = \pi (63x^3) + \pi (66x^2) + \pi (15x)
\]
\[
\text{Remaining water} = \pi (63x^3 + 66x^2 + 15x)
\]

#### Step 5: Final Answer
The amount of water remaining after \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds is:
\[
\boxed{\pi (63x^3 + 66x^2 + 15x)}
\]
