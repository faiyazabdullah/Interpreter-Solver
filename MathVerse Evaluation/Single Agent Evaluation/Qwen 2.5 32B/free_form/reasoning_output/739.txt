QUESTION:
A pyramid has been removed from a rectangular prism, as shown in the figure. The height of the rectangular prism is 8cm, its length and width are 15cm and 9cm respectively. Find the volume of this composite solid.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure shows a composite solid formed by removing a pyramid from a rectangular prism. We need to find the volume of this composite solid. Here's the breakdown of the problem:

1. **Rectangular Prism Dimensions**:
   - Length (\( l \)) = 15 cm
   - Width (\( w \)) = 9 cm
   - Height (\( h \)) = 8 cm

2. **Pyramid Removed**:
   - The base of the pyramid is the same as the top face of the rectangular prism (a rectangle with dimensions 15 cm Ã— 9 cm).
   - The height of the pyramid is the same as the height of the rectangular prism (8 cm).

3. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the volume of the original rectangular prism.
   - Calculate the volume of the pyramid that was removed.
   - Subtract the volume of the pyramid from the volume of the rectangular prism to find the volume of the composite solid.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Volume of the Rectangular Prism
The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is:
\[
V_{\text{prism}} = l \times w \times h
\]
Substituting the given dimensions:
\[
V_{\text{prism}} = 15 \times 9 \times 8 = 1080 \text{ cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2: Volume of the Pyramid
The formula for the volume of a pyramid is:
\[
V_{\text{pyramid}} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
\]
The base area of the pyramid is the same as the top face of the rectangular prism:
\[
\text{Base Area} = l \times w = 15 \times 9 = 135 \text{ cm}^2
\]
The height of the pyramid is the same as the height of the rectangular prism:
\[
\text{Height} = 8 \text{ cm}
\]
Substituting these values into the formula:
\[
V_{\text{pyramid}} = \frac{1}{3} \times 135 \times 8 = \frac{1}{3} \times 1080 = 360 \text{ cm}^3
\]

#### Step 3: Volume of the Composite Solid
The volume of the composite solid is the volume of the rectangular prism minus the volume of the pyramid:
\[
V_{\text{composite}} = V_{\text{prism}} - V_{\text{pyramid}}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
V_{\text{composite}} = 1080 - 360 = 720 \text{ cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{720 \text{ cm}^3}
\]
