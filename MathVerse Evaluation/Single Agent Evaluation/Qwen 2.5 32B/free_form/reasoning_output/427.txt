QUESTION:
A boat travels S 14^\circ E for 12 km and then changes direction to S 49^\circ E for another 16 km.

Hence write down the bearing that the boat should travel on to return to the starting point.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the bearing the boat should take to return to its starting point after traveling two segments: first S 14째 E for 12 km, and then S 49째 E for 16 km. We will use vector analysis and trigonometry to find the resultant displacement and the required bearing.

### Step 1: Break down the displacements into components
We represent each segment of the boat's journey as a vector and break them into their respective north-south and east-west components.

#### First Segment: S 14째 E for 12 km
- The angle from the south direction is \(14^\circ\) east.
- North component: \(-12 \sin(14^\circ)\) (negative because it is southward)
- East component: \(12 \cos(14^\circ)\)

Using trigonometric values:
\[
\sin(14^\circ) \approx 0.2419, \quad \cos(14^\circ) \approx 0.9703
\]
\[
\text{North component} = -12 \cdot 0.2419 = -2.9028 \text{ km}
\]
\[
\text{East component} = 12 \cdot 0.9703 = 11.6436 \text{ km}
\]

#### Second Segment: S 49째 E for 16 km
- The angle from the south direction is \(49^\circ\) east.
- North component: \(-16 \sin(49^\circ)\) (negative because it is southward)
- East component: \(16 \cos(49^\circ)\)

Using trigonometric values:
\[
\sin(49^\circ) \approx 0.7547, \quad \cos(49^\circ) \approx 0.6561
\]
\[
\text{North component} = -16 \cdot 0.7547 = -12.0752 \text{ km}
\]
\[
\text{East component} = 16 \cdot 0.6561 = 10.4976 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total displacement
Sum the north and east components from both segments:
\[
\text{Total North component} = -2.9028 + (-12.0752) = -14.9780 \text{ km}
\]
\[
\text{Total East component} = 11.6436 + 10.4976 = 22.1412 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the resultant displacement
The resultant displacement vector has components:
- North component: \(-14.9780\) km
- East component: \(22.1412\) km

The magnitude of the resultant displacement \(R\) is given by:
\[
R = \sqrt{(\text{Total North component})^2 + (\text{Total East component})^2}
\]
\[
R = \sqrt{(-14.9780)^2 + (22.1412)^2}
\]
\[
R = \sqrt{224.340 + 490.228} = \sqrt{714.568} \approx 26.73 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the bearing to return to the starting point
The bearing to return to the starting point is the reverse of the direction of the resultant displacement. The angle \(\theta\) that the resultant displacement makes with the east direction (measured clockwise from north) is given by:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \left| \frac{\text{Total North component}}{\text{Total East component}} \right| = \frac{14.9780}{22.1412}
\]
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{14.9780}{22.1412}\right) \approx \tan^{-1}(0.6766) \approx 34.0^\circ
\]

Since the resultant displacement is in the fourth quadrant (south of east), the bearing to return to the starting point is:
\[
N (180^\circ - 34.0^\circ) W = N 146^\circ W
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{N 146^\circ W}
\]
