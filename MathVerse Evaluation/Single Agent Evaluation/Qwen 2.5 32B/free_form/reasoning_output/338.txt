QUESTION:
In the figure below, point B is due East of point A. We want to find the position of point A relative to point C. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 49° and angle B is 39°.

Find the true bearing of point A from point C.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( C \). The given information includes:
- Point \( B \) is due East of point \( A \).
- In triangle \( ABC \), \( \angle A = 49^\circ \) and \( \angle B = 39^\circ \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Determine \( \angle C \)
In triangle \( ABC \), the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can find \( \angle C \) as follows:
\[
\angle C = 180^\circ - \angle A - \angle B
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\angle C = 180^\circ - 49^\circ - 39^\circ = 92^\circ
\]

#### Step 2: Understand the orientation of points
- Point \( B \) is due East of point \( A \). This means the direction from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( 90^\circ \) (measured clockwise from North).
- We need to determine the direction from \( C \) to \( A \). To do this, we will analyze the triangle and the bearings involved.

#### Step 3: Determine the bearing of \( A \) from \( C \)
To find the bearing of \( A \) from \( C \), we need to consider the orientation of the triangle and the angles provided. Since \( \angle C = 92^\circ \), we can infer the relative positions of the points.

- The bearing from \( C \) to \( A \) involves understanding the direction of the side \( CA \) relative to North.
- Since \( \angle C = 92^\circ \), the side \( CA \) is slightly south of west. To find the exact bearing, we need to consider the internal angles and the fact that \( B \) is due East of \( A \).

#### Step 4: Use the Law of Sines (if necessary)
Although the Law of Sines could be used to find side lengths, it is not necessary here since we are only asked for the bearing. Instead, we focus on the angular relationships.

#### Step 5: Calculate the true bearing
The true bearing of \( A \) from \( C \) can be determined by considering the internal angles and the fact that \( B \) is due East of \( A \). The key is to recognize that the bearing is measured clockwise from North.

- Since \( \angle C = 92^\circ \), the direction from \( C \) to \( A \) is slightly south of west.
- The bearing of \( A \) from \( C \) is \( 270^\circ - 92^\circ = 178^\circ \) (measured clockwise from North).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{281^\circ}
\]
