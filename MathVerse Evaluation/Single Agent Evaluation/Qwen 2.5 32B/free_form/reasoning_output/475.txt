QUESTION:
There is a point at 4 and a blue arrow goes to left from that point. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image provided shows a number line with a point labeled at \( 4 \). A blue arrow extends to the left from this point. This indicates that we are dealing with a set of numbers that extend infinitely to the left of \( 4 \), but do not include \( 4 \) itself. The task is to represent this set of numbers in interval notation.

#### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify the Point and Direction:**
   - The point on the number line is labeled \( 4 \).
   - The blue arrow points to the left, indicating that the set includes all numbers less than \( 4 \).

2. **Determine the Set:**
   - Since the arrow extends infinitely to the left, the set includes all real numbers less than \( 4 \).
   - The point \( 4 \) is not included in the set because the arrow does not touch or point toward it directly at \( 4 \).

3. **Express the Set in Interval Notation:**
   - In interval notation, a set that includes all numbers less than a specific value (but not including that value) is written as \( (-\infty, a) \), where \( a \) is the boundary value.
   - Here, the boundary value is \( 4 \), and since \( 4 \) is not included, the interval is \( (-\infty, 4) \).

4. **Verify the Interval:**
   - The interval \( (-\infty, 4) \) correctly represents all real numbers less than \( 4 \).
   - The use of \( -\infty \) indicates that the set extends infinitely to the left, and the open parenthesis \( ( \) around \( 4 \) indicates that \( 4 \) is not included.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(-\infty, 4)}
\]
