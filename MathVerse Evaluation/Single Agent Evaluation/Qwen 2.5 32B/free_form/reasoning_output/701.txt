====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a triangular prism. To find its surface area, we need to calculate the areas of all its faces: two congruent triangular bases and three rectangular lateral faces.

#### Given Information:
- **Base of the triangular prism**: An isosceles triangle with:
  - Base length \( b = 12 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Waist (equal sides) \( s = 10 \, \text{cm} \)
  - Height of the triangle \( h_{\triangle} = 8 \, \text{cm} \)
- **Height of the prism**: \( H = 21 \, \text{cm} \)

#### Objective:
Calculate the total surface area of the triangular prism.

### Step 1: Calculate the Area of One Triangular Base
The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\text{Area}_{\triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \, \text{cm} \times 8 \, \text{cm} = 48 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Since there are two triangular bases, the total area of both bases is:
\[
2 \times \text{Area}_{\triangle} = 2 \times 48 \, \text{cm}^2 = 96 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 2: Calculate the Areas of the Three Rectangular Lateral Faces
The three rectangular lateral faces are formed by the height of the prism (\( H = 21 \, \text{cm} \)) and the sides of the triangular base. The dimensions of these rectangles are:
1. Rectangle with width \( 12 \, \text{cm} \) (base of the triangle) and height \( 21 \, \text{cm} \).
2. Two rectangles with width \( 10 \, \text{cm} \) (waist of the triangle) and height \( 21 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Area of the Rectangle with Base \( 12 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{rect}_1} = 12 \, \text{cm} \times 21 \, \text{cm} = 252 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Area of Each Rectangle with Waist \( 10 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{rect}_2} = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 21 \, \text{cm} = 210 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Since there are two such rectangles, their combined area is:
\[
2 \times \text{Area}_{\text{rect}_2} = 2 \times 210 \, \text{cm}^2 = 420 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Surface Area
The total surface area of the triangular prism is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the three rectangular lateral faces:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Area of both triangular bases} + \text{Area of all three rectangular faces}
\]
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 96 \, \text{cm}^2 + 252 \, \text{cm}^2 + 420 \, \text{cm}^2 = 768 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{768 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
