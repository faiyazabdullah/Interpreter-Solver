QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 37Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( P \) from point \( M \). The given information includes:
- Point \( S \) represents the south cardinal direction.
- The angle \( \angle PMS \) is given as \( 37^\circ \).
- The diagram shows that the angle at point \( M \) relative to the vertical line (pointing south) is \( 323^\circ \).

#### Step 1: Understanding Bearings
A true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction. Therefore:
- North corresponds to \( 0^\circ \).
- South corresponds to \( 180^\circ \).
- East corresponds to \( 90^\circ \).
- West corresponds to \( 270^\circ \).

The angle \( \angle PMS = 37^\circ \) indicates the angular separation between the line \( PM \) and the vertical line pointing south (line \( MS \)).

#### Step 2: Determine the Direction of Line \( MS \)
The angle \( 323^\circ \) at point \( M \) is measured from the north direction. This means:
- The line \( MS \) (pointing south) has a true bearing of \( 323^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Calculate the True Bearing of Line \( PM \)
Since \( \angle PMS = 37^\circ \), we need to determine the direction of \( PM \) relative to the north direction. The line \( PM \) is oriented \( 37^\circ \) counterclockwise from the line \( MS \).

To find the true bearing of \( PM \):
1. Start with the bearing of \( MS \), which is \( 323^\circ \).
2. Add \( 37^\circ \) to this bearing because \( PM \) is \( 37^\circ \) counterclockwise from \( MS \).

\[
\text{True bearing of } PM = 323^\circ + 37^\circ = 360^\circ
\]

However, since bearings are typically expressed as values less than \( 360^\circ \), we subtract \( 360^\circ \) to bring it back into the standard range:

\[
360^\circ - 360^\circ = 0^\circ
\]

Thus, the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \) is \( 0^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{0^\circ}
\]
