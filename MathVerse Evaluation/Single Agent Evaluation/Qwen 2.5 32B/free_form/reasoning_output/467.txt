QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, below.

State the equation of the circle shown in the graph.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the equation of the circle shown in the graph. Let's follow the solution steps systematically.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the given information**
- The circle intersects the axes at two points.
- The center of the circle appears to be located at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The circle's radius can be determined by measuring the distance from the center to any point on the circle.

From the graph:
- The circle passes through the point \((0, -6)\) on the \(y\)-axis.
- The circle also passes through the point \((-6, 0)\) on the \(x\)-axis.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the relationship**
The general equation of a circle with center \((h, k)\) and radius \(r\) is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]
Since the center of the circle is at \((0, 0)\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
\]

---

### **Step 3: Determine the radius**
The radius \(r\) is the distance from the center \((0, 0)\) to any point on the circle. Using the point \((0, -6)\):
\[
r = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (-6 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 36} = 6
\]
Thus, the radius \(r = 6\).

---

### **Step 4: Write the equation of the circle**
Substitute \(r = 6\) into the simplified equation:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 6^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 36
\]

---

### **Step 5: Verify the solution**
- The center of the circle is \((0, 0)\), which matches the graph.
- The radius is \(6\), and the circle indeed passes through \((0, -6)\) and \((-6, 0)\), as seen in the graph.

---

### **Final Answer**
The equation of the circle is:
\[
\boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 36}
\]
