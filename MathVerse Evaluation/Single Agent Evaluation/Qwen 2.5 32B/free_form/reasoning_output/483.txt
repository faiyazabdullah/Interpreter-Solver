QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure**
The image shows a parabolic curve that passes through three points:
- \( (-4, 0) \)
- \( (0, 2) \)
- \( (4, 0) \)

The points at \( (-4, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \) are marked as solid points, indicating they are part of the domain of the function.

#### **Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships**
- The curve is symmetric about the vertical line \( x = 0 \).
- The vertex of the parabola is at \( (0, 2) \), which is the highest point on the curve.
- The curve intersects the \( x \)-axis at \( (-4, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \).

#### **Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
We need to determine the **domain** and **range** of the function represented by the curve.

#### **Step 4: Apply Relevant Concepts**
- **Domain**: The set of all possible \( x \)-values for which the function is defined. From the graph, the curve extends horizontally from \( x = -4 \) to \( x = 4 \), inclusive.
- **Range**: The set of all possible \( y \)-values that the function can take. From the graph, the curve starts at \( y = 0 \) (at the points \( (-4, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \)) and reaches its maximum value of \( y = 2 \) at the vertex \( (0, 2) \).

#### **Step 5: Show Calculations**
1. **Domain**:
   - The curve starts at \( x = -4 \) and ends at \( x = 4 \).
   - Since the points at \( (-4, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \) are included, the domain is a closed interval.
   - Therefore, the domain is \( [-4, 4] \).

2. **Range**:
   - The lowest \( y \)-value on the curve is \( y = 0 \) (at the points \( (-4, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \)).
   - The highest \( y \)-value on the curve is \( y = 2 \) (at the vertex \( (0, 2) \)).
   - Since the curve includes all values between \( y = 0 \) and \( y = 2 \), the range is a closed interval.
   - Therefore, the range is \( [0, 2] \).

#### **Final Answer**:
The domain and range of the function are:
\[ \text{Domain: } [-4, 4], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2] \]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{\text{Domain: } [-4, 4], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]}\]
