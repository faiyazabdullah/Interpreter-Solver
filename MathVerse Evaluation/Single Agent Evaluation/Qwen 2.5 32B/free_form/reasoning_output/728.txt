QUESTION:
Each side length of the cube is equal to 12cm. Find the volume of the cube shown.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a cube with a side length labeled as \(12 \, \text{cm}\). The task is to find the volume of the cube.

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- The side length of the cube is \(12 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- A cube is a three-dimensional shape with all sides of equal length.
- The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:
  \[
  V = s^3
  \]
  where \(s\) is the side length of the cube.

#### Step 3: Determine What Needs to Be Found
- We need to calculate the volume of the cube using the given side length.

#### Step 4: Apply the Formula
- Substitute the side length \(s = 12 \, \text{cm}\) into the volume formula:
  \[
  V = s^3 = 12^3
  \]

#### Step 5: Perform the Calculations
- Calculate \(12^3\):
  \[
  12^3 = 12 \times 12 \times 12
  \]
  \[
  12 \times 12 = 144
  \]
  \[
  144 \times 12 = 1728
  \]

#### Step 6: Include Units
- Since the side length is in centimeters, the volume will be in cubic centimeters (\(\text{cm}^3\)).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1728 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
