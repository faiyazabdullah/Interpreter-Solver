QUESTION:
A wedding cake consists of three cylinders stacked on top of each other. The top layer has a radius and height of 20 cm, the middle layer has a radius double this, and the same height and the bottom layer has a radius three times as big, and is twice as high.

All the sides and top surfaces are to be covered in icing, but not the bottom.

What is the surface area of the cake that needs to be iced?

Give your answer to the nearest cm2.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves calculating the total surface area of a wedding cake consisting of three cylindrical layers. The goal is to determine the surface area that needs to be iced, excluding the bottom base of the entire cake. Here's a breakdown of the given information:

1. **Top Layer**:
   - Radius \( r_1 = 20 \) cm
   - Height \( h_1 = 20 \) cm

2. **Middle Layer**:
   - Radius \( r_2 = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cm
   - Height \( h_2 = 20 \) cm

3. **Bottom Layer**:
   - Radius \( r_3 = 3 \times 20 = 60 \) cm
   - Height \( h_3 = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) cm

The surface area to be iced includes:
- The lateral surface area of each cylinder.
- The top surface area of each cylinder (except the bottommost layer, which does not have a top surface exposed).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Lateral Surface Area of Each Cylinder
The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi r h
\]

##### Top Layer:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area}_1 = 2\pi r_1 h_1 = 2\pi (20)(20) = 800\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

##### Middle Layer:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area}_2 = 2\pi r_2 h_2 = 2\pi (40)(20) = 1600\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

##### Bottom Layer:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area}_3 = 2\pi r_3 h_3 = 2\pi (60)(40) = 4800\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### 2. Top Surface Area of Each Cylinder
The formula for the top surface area of a cylinder (a circle) is:
\[
\text{Top Surface Area} = \pi r^2
\]

##### Top Layer:
\[
\text{Top Surface Area}_1 = \pi r_1^2 = \pi (20)^2 = 400\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

##### Middle Layer:
\[
\text{Top Surface Area}_2 = \pi r_2^2 = \pi (40)^2 = 1600\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

##### Bottom Layer:
The bottom layer does not contribute to the top surface area because it is the lowest layer and its top surface is already covered by the middle layer.

#### 3. Total Surface Area to Be Iced
The total surface area to be iced is the sum of:
- The lateral surface areas of all three layers.
- The top surface areas of the top and middle layers.

\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = (\text{Lateral Surface Area}_1 + \text{Lateral Surface Area}_2 + \text{Lateral Surface Area}_3) + (\text{Top Surface Area}_1 + \text{Top Surface Area}_2)
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = (800\pi + 1600\pi + 4800\pi) + (400\pi + 1600\pi)
\]

Simplify:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = (800\pi + 1600\pi + 4800\pi) + (400\pi + 1600\pi) = 7200\pi + 2000\pi = 9200\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### 4. Approximate the Result
Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
\[
9200\pi \approx 9200 \times 3.1416 = 28906.56 \text{ cm}^2
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number:
\[
28907 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{28907}
\]
