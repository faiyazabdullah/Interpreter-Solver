QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2). The point at (-5,2) and (3,2) are respectively solid and hollow. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure**
The image shows a curve plotted on a Cartesian coordinate plane. Key observations:
- The curve passes through the points:
  - \( (-5, 2) \) (solid point),
  - \( (-1, 0) \) (on the x-axis),
  - \( (3, 2) \) (hollow point).
- The curve extends horizontally from \( x = -5 \) to \( x = 3 \).
- The y-values of the curve range from \( y = 0 \) to \( y = 2 \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships**
- The solid point at \( (-5, 2) \) indicates that \( x = -5 \) is included in the domain.
- The hollow point at \( (3, 2) \) indicates that \( x = 3 \) is not included in the domain.
- The curve starts at \( x = -5 \) and ends just before \( x = 3 \).

#### **Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
We need to determine the **domain** and **range** of the function represented by the curve. The domain is the set of all possible \( x \)-values, and the range is the set of all possible \( y \)-values.

#### **Step 4: Apply Relevant Concepts**
- **Domain**: The domain is the interval of \( x \)-values covered by the curve. From the graph:
  - The curve starts at \( x = -5 \) (inclusive) and ends just before \( x = 3 \) (exclusive).
  - Therefore, the domain is \( [-5, 3) \).

- **Range**: The range is the interval of \( y \)-values covered by the curve. From the graph:
  - The lowest \( y \)-value is \( y = 0 \) (at \( x = -1 \)).
  - The highest \( y \)-value is \( y = 2 \) (at \( x = -5 \) and approaching \( x = 3 \)).
  - Therefore, the range is \( [0, 2] \).

#### **Step 5: Show Calculations**
- **Domain**: The curve starts at \( x = -5 \) (solid point, inclusive) and ends just before \( x = 3 \) (hollow point, exclusive). Thus, the domain is:
  \[
  \text{Domain: } [-5, 3)
  \]

- **Range**: The curve reaches a minimum \( y \)-value of \( 0 \) and a maximum \( y \)-value of \( 2 \). Since both values are included in the graph, the range is:
  \[
  \text{Range: } [0, 2]
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Domain: } [-5, 3), \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]}
\]
