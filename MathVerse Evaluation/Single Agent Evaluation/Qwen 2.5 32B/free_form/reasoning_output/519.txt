QUESTION:
The function $f(x)=5 x-x^2$ in blue gives the number of mosquitos in the forest (in millions), and the function $g(x)=3 x-0.5 x^2$ in red gives the number of bats (in millions). In both equations $x$ represents rainfall (in centimeters). $g(x)$ goes through (0,0), (3,6), (6,0) and opens downward. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,0), (2,6), (3,6), (5,0) and opens downsward. When there is $0 \mathrm{~cm}$ of rainfall, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats. What is another rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats?
Round your answer to the nearest half centimeter.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
We are given two quadratic functions:
- \( f(x) = 5x - x^2 \): Represents the number of mosquitos in millions.
- \( g(x) = 3x - 0.5x^2 \): Represents the number of bats in millions.
Both functions depend on \( x \), which represents rainfall in centimeters. We are tasked with finding another value of \( x \) (besides \( x = 0 \)) where the number of mosquitos equals the number of bats.

### Step 1: Set up the equation
To find the points where the number of mosquitos equals the number of bats, we set \( f(x) = g(x) \):
\[
5x - x^2 = 3x - 0.5x^2
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the equation
Rearrange the terms to bring everything to one side of the equation:
\[
5x - x^2 - 3x + 0.5x^2 = 0
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
(5x - 3x) + (-x^2 + 0.5x^2) = 0
\]
\[
2x - 0.5x^2 = 0
\]
Factor out \( x \):
\[
x(2 - 0.5x) = 0
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
The equation \( x(2 - 0.5x) = 0 \) gives us two solutions:
1. \( x = 0 \)
2. \( 2 - 0.5x = 0 \)

Solve the second equation:
\[
2 - 0.5x = 0 \implies 0.5x = 2 \implies x = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4
\]

### Step 4: Verify the solution
The solutions to the equation are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 4 \). The problem states that \( x = 0 \) is already known, so the other solution is \( x = 4 \).

### Step 5: Round to the nearest half centimeter
The value \( x = 4 \) is already a whole number and does not need rounding. Since it is already precise to the nearest half centimeter, we can proceed.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
