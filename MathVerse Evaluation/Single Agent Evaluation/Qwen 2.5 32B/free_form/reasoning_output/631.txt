### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves analyzing the transformation applied to the standard sine function \( y = \sin x \) to determine the coordinates of the first maximum point for the transformed function \( y = -5\sin x \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Standard Sine Function
The standard sine function \( y = \sin x \) has the following key features:
- Period: \( 360^\circ \)
- Amplitude: 1
- Maximum value: 1, occurring at \( x = 90^\circ \)
- Symmetry: The function is odd (\( \sin(-x) = -\sin(x) \)).

From the graph provided, we observe:
- The sine function passes through the points: \( (0, 0) \), \( (90, 1) \), \( (180, 0) \), \( (270, -1) \), and \( (360, 0) \).
- The maximum value of \( y = \sin x \) occurs at \( (90, 1) \).

#### Step 2: Analyze the Transformation \( y = -5\sin x \)
The given function is \( y = -5\sin x \). This transformation involves two effects:
1. **Amplitude Change**: The coefficient \( 5 \) multiplies the amplitude of the sine function. The original amplitude of \( \sin x \) is 1, so the new amplitude becomes \( 5 \).
2. **Reflection**: The negative sign (\( - \)) reflects the function across the \( x \)-axis. This means that the maximum values of \( \sin x \) become minimum values in \( -\sin x \), and vice versa.

#### Step 3: Determine the Maximum Point of \( y = -5\sin x \)
- The standard sine function \( y = \sin x \) reaches its maximum value of 1 at \( x = 90^\circ \).
- After applying the transformation \( y = -5\sin x \):
  - The amplitude is scaled by 5, so the maximum value of \( \sin x \) (which is 1) becomes \( -5 \times 1 = -5 \).
  - However, since the function is reflected across the \( x \)-axis, the maximum value of \( y = -5\sin x \) will occur where \( \sin x \) is at its minimum value (i.e., \( \sin x = -1 \)).
  - The minimum value of \( \sin x \) is \(-1\), which occurs at \( x = 270^\circ \). When reflected, this becomes the maximum value of \( y = -5\sin x \).

Thus, the maximum value of \( y = -5\sin x \) is \( 5 \), and it occurs at \( x = 270^\circ \).

#### Step 4: State the Coordinates of the First Maximum Point
The first maximum point of \( y = -5\sin x \) for \( x \geq 0 \) is \( (270, 5) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(270, 5)}
\]
