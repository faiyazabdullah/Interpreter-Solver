QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the figure shown, rounded to two decimal places. Assume that the solid is three quarters of a cylinder. The height is 12 cm and radius is 5 cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The figure represents a three-quarter cylinder. We are tasked with finding the surface area of this three-quarter cylinder. The dimensions provided are:
- Radius of the cylinder, \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \)
- Height of the cylinder, \( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \)

#### Step 1: Break Down the Surface Area Components
The surface area of a three-quarter cylinder consists of the following components:
1. **Curved Surface Area of the Three-Quarter Cylinder**
2. **Base Areas (Two Quarter Circles)**
3. **Rectangular Faces (Two Rectangles)**

#### Step 2: Curved Surface Area of the Three-Quarter Cylinder
The curved surface area of a full cylinder is given by:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Full Cylinder} = 2\pi rh
\]
Since we have a three-quarter cylinder, the curved surface area is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Three-Quarter Cylinder} = \frac{3}{4} \times 2\pi rh = \frac{3}{2} \pi rh
\]
Substitute \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \) and \( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area} = \frac{3}{2} \pi (5)(12) = \frac{3}{2} \pi (60) = 90\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 3: Base Areas (Two Quarter Circles)
Each base of the three-quarter cylinder is a quarter circle. The area of a full circle is:
\[
\text{Area of Full Circle} = \pi r^2
\]
The area of one quarter circle is:
\[
\text{Area of One Quarter Circle} = \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2
\]
Since there are two bases (top and bottom), the total area of the two quarter circles is:
\[
\text{Total Base Area} = 2 \times \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Total Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (5)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (25) = \frac{25}{2} \pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Rectangular Faces (Two Rectangles)
Each rectangular face has a width equal to the height of the cylinder (\( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \)) and a length equal to the arc length of the quarter circle. The arc length of a quarter circle is:
\[
\text{Arc Length of One Quarter Circle} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2\pi r = \frac{\pi r}{2}
\]
Thus, the area of one rectangular face is:
\[
\text{Area of One Rectangular Face} = h \times \frac{\pi r}{2} = 12 \times \frac{\pi (5)}{2} = 12 \times \frac{5\pi}{2} = 30\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Since there are two rectangular faces, the total area of the two rectangles is:
\[
\text{Total Rectangular Area} = 2 \times 30\pi = 60\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Total Surface Area
The total surface area is the sum of the curved surface area, the base areas, and the rectangular areas:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area} + \text{Total Base Area} + \text{Total Rectangular Area}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 90\pi + \frac{25}{2}\pi + 60\pi
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \left(90 + \frac{25}{2} + 60\right)\pi = \left(\frac{180}{2} + \frac{25}{2} + \frac{120}{2}\right)\pi = \frac{325}{2}\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 6: Numerical Approximation
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \frac{325}{2} \pi \approx \frac{325}{2} \times 3.14159 \approx 506.84 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{506.84 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
