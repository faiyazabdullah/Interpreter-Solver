QUESTION:
Considering the diagram below, find x, the angle of elevation to point A from point C. The picture shows a right angled triangle with a base length of 25 and a height of 19.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves a right triangle with the following key components:
- The base (adjacent side) \( BC = 25 \).
- The height (opposite side) \( AC = 19 \).
- The angle of elevation \( x \) is the angle at point \( C \) formed by the base \( BC \) and the hypotenuse \( AB \).

We need to find the angle \( x \), which is the angle of elevation from point \( C \) to point \( A \). This can be determined using trigonometric relationships, specifically the tangent function, since we have the opposite and adjacent sides.

#### Step 1: Identify the relevant trigonometric function
The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side:
\[
\tan(x) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{19}{25}
\]

#### Step 2: Solve for the angle \( x \)
To find the angle \( x \), we take the inverse tangent (arctangent) of the ratio \( \frac{19}{25} \):
\[
x = \arctan\left(\frac{19}{25}\right)
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the value
Using a calculator to compute the arctangent:
\[
\arctan\left(\frac{19}{25}\right) \approx 37.37^\circ
\]

#### Step 4: Round the result to two decimal places
The angle \( x \) rounded to two decimal places is \( 37.37^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{37.37^\circ}
\]
