QUESTION:
The graph shows $y_1=x^3$ passing (0,0) and a vertical or horizontal translation $y_2$ passing (-2,0). The blue line is solid while the red line is dotted. Write an equation for $y_2$ as shown in the graph.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given graph shows two cubic functions:
1. \( y_1 = x^3 \), which is a standard cubic function passing through the origin \((0, 0)\).
2. \( y_2 \), which is a translated version of \( y_1 \). The translated function passes through the point \((-2, 0)\).

The goal is to determine the equation of \( y_2 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Translation
The function \( y_1 = x^3 \) is being transformed into \( y_2 \). Since \( y_2 \) passes through \((-2, 0)\), we need to determine how \( y_1 \) has been translated horizontally or vertically.

#### Step 2: Identify the Type of Translation
- The point \((0, 0)\) on \( y_1 \) corresponds to the point \((-2, 0)\) on \( y_2 \). This suggests a horizontal shift.
- Specifically, the point \((0, 0)\) on \( y_1 \) moves to \((-2, 0)\) on \( y_2 \). This indicates a horizontal shift to the left by 2 units.

#### Step 3: Apply Horizontal Translation
A horizontal shift to the left by 2 units is represented by replacing \( x \) with \( x + 2 \) in the original function \( y_1 = x^3 \). Thus, the equation for \( y_2 \) becomes:
\[
y_2 = (x + 2)^3
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Translation
To confirm, substitute \( x = -2 \) into the equation \( y_2 = (x + 2)^3 \):
\[
y_2 = ((-2) + 2)^3 = 0^3 = 0
\]
This confirms that the point \((-2, 0)\) lies on the curve \( y_2 = (x + 2)^3 \).

### Final Answer:
The equation for \( y_2 \) is:
\[
\boxed{y_2 = (x + 2)^3}
\]
