QUESTION:
A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions, splitted by a middle base. Length of middle base is 8, height of upper square pyramid is 2x+3, height of whole square pyramid is 6x+9.

Find an expression for the length L of the base of the pyramid in terms of the variable, x.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length \( L \) of the base of a square pyramid in terms of \( x \). The pyramid is split into two parts by a horizontal plane, creating an upper smaller pyramid and a frustum below it. Here are the key details from the image:

1. **Middle Base (Frustum Top Edge)**: The length of the middle base is given as 8.
2. **Height of Upper Pyramid**: The height of the upper pyramid is \( 2x + 3 \).
3. **Total Height of Whole Pyramid**: The total height of the whole pyramid is \( 6x + 9 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understanding Similarity
The upper pyramid and the whole pyramid are similar geometrically because they share the same apex and their bases are parallel. This similarity implies that the ratios of corresponding linear dimensions (such as heights and base lengths) are equal.

Let:
- \( h_1 = 2x + 3 \): Height of the upper pyramid.
- \( h_2 = 6x + 9 \): Total height of the whole pyramid.
- \( b_1 = 8 \): Length of the middle base (top edge of the frustum).
- \( b_2 = L \): Length of the base of the whole pyramid.

From the similarity of the pyramids:
\[
\frac{\text{Base of upper pyramid}}{\text{Base of whole pyramid}} = \frac{\text{Height of upper pyramid}}{\text{Height of whole pyramid}}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\frac{8}{L} = \frac{2x + 3}{6x + 9}
\]

#### Step 2: Solve for \( L \)
Cross-multiply to solve for \( L \):
\[
8(6x + 9) = L(2x + 3)
\]
Expand both sides:
\[
48x + 72 = L(2x + 3)
\]
Divide both sides by \( 2x + 3 \) to isolate \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{48x + 72}{2x + 3}
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Expression
Factor out the common factor in the numerator:
\[
48x + 72 = 24(2x + 3)
\]
Thus:
\[
L = \frac{24(2x + 3)}{2x + 3}
\]
Since \( 2x + 3 \neq 0 \), we can cancel \( 2x + 3 \) in the numerator and denominator:
\[
L = 24
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
