QUESTION:
Assume that both boxes are identical in size. The box has edges of length 20, 25 and 33. The middle cylinder has radius of 6 and height of 11.
Find the surface area of the solid.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the surface area of the solid shown in the image. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
The solid consists of:
1. Two identical rectangular prisms (boxes).
2. A cylindrical hole running through the center of each box.

#### Dimensions of the Boxes:
- Length: \(25\)
- Width: \(20\)
- Height: \(33\)

#### Dimensions of the Cylinder:
- Radius: \(6\)
- Height: \(11\) (which is the same as the width of the boxes).

### Step 2: Calculate the Surface Area of One Box
The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area of a Box} = 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]
where \(l = 25\), \(w = 20\), and \(h = 33\). Plugging in the values:
\[
\text{Surface Area of One Box} = 2(25 \cdot 20 + 25 \cdot 33 + 20 \cdot 33)
\]
\[
= 2(500 + 825 + 660)
\]
\[
= 2(1985)
\]
\[
= 3970
\]

Since there are two identical boxes, the total surface area of the two boxes without considering the cylindrical holes is:
\[
2 \times 3970 = 7940
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the Surface Area of the Cylindrical Holes
The cylindrical holes remove material from the surface area of the boxes. Each cylindrical hole has a surface area that includes:
1. The lateral surface area of the cylinder.
2. The areas of the circular bases that are removed from the boxes.

#### Lateral Surface Area of One Cylinder:
The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
\]
where \(r = 6\) and \(h = 11\). Plugging in the values:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 11 = 132\pi
\]

#### Areas of the Circular Bases:
Each cylinder has two circular bases, but these bases are not part of the external surface area of the solid. Instead, they are internal surfaces that are not counted in the total surface area.

### Step 4: Add the Internal Surface Area of the Cylinders
The internal surface area of the cylinders (the lateral surface area) must be added back to the total surface area because it becomes part of the external surface of the solid due to the holes.

#### Total Internal Surface Area of Both Cylinders:
Since there are two identical cylinders, the total internal surface area is:
\[
2 \times 132\pi = 264\pi
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Final Surface Area
The final surface area of the solid is the sum of the surface areas of the two boxes minus the areas of the circular bases (which are not part of the external surface) plus the internal surface area of the cylinders:
\[
\text{Final Surface Area} = 7940 + 264\pi
\]

### Step 6: Approximate the Final Answer
Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
264\pi \approx 264 \times 3.14159 = 829.92
\]
Thus, the final surface area is:
\[
7940 + 829.92 = 8769.92
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8770.00}
\]
