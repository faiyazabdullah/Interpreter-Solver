QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 3.3\right)$, and it has a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 9.8)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves analyzing a trigonometric function's graph to determine its amplitude. The key pieces of information provided are:
1. The function intersects its midline at the point \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 3.3\right)\).
2. The function has a maximum point at \((-2\pi, 9.8)\).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Midline
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the oscillation. It is given by the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function. Since the function intersects its midline at \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 3.3\right)\), the midline is the horizontal line \(y = 3.3\).

#### Step 2: Identifying the Maximum Point
The maximum point of the function is given as \((-2\pi, 9.8)\). This means the highest value of the function is \(9.8\).

#### Step 3: Defining Amplitude
The amplitude of a trigonometric function is the vertical distance from the midline to the maximum (or minimum) value of the function. Mathematically, it is calculated as:
\[
\text{Amplitude} = \frac{\text{Maximum Value} - \text{Minimum Value}}{2}
\]
However, since we know the midline and the maximum value, we can simplify this to:
\[
\text{Amplitude} = \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Midline}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculating the Amplitude
From the given information:
- Maximum Value = \(9.8\)
- Midline = \(3.3\)

Using the formula for amplitude:
\[
\text{Amplitude} = 9.8 - 3.3 = 6.5
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{6.5}
\]
