QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Write the equation of the circle in the form \left(x-h\right)^2+\left(y-k\right)^2=r^2.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Analysis of the Problem

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a circle on a Cartesian coordinate plane. The circle intersects the axes at four points, indicating that it is centered away from the origin and has a radius that allows it to touch both the x-axis and y-axis.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Features
1. **Center of the Circle**: The center of the circle appears to be located near the point \((-3, -2)\). This is visually estimated from the symmetry of the circle relative to its intersections with the axes.
2. **Radius of the Circle**: The circle intersects the x-axis and y-axis, suggesting that the distance from the center to each axis is equal to the radius \( r \).
   - Intersection with the x-axis: The circle touches the x-axis at approximately \((-3, 0)\). The vertical distance from the center \((-3, -2)\) to the x-axis is \(2\) units.
   - Intersection with the y-axis: The circle touches the y-axis at approximately \((0, -2)\). The horizontal distance from the center \((-3, -2)\) to the y-axis is \(3\) units.
   - Since the circle is symmetric, the radius \( r \) is the same in both directions. Thus, \( r = 3 \).

#### Step 3: Write the Equation of the Circle
The general form of the equation of a circle is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]
where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle, and \( r \) is the radius.

From the analysis:
- The center \((h, k)\) is \((-3, -2)\).
- The radius \( r \) is \(3\).

Substitute these values into the equation:
\[
(x - (-3))^2 + (y - (-2))^2 = 3^2
\]
Simplify:
\[
(x + 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
- The center \((-3, -2)\) is consistent with the visual estimate from the graph.
- The radius \( r = 3 \) ensures that the circle intersects the x-axis at \((-3, 0)\) and the y-axis at \((0, -2)\), as observed in the image.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{(x + 3)^2 + (y + 2)^2 = 9}
\]
