QUESTION:
In the figure above, the seven small circles, which have equal radii, and the large circle share only those points on the circles that are marked. Point P is the center of the large circle and PA and PB are radii. The area of the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles?

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining how many times the area of the shaded region is compared to the area of one of the small circles. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- The large circle has its center at point \( P \).
- There are seven small circles, each with the same radius. These small circles are tangent to each other and to the large circle at specific points.
- The shaded region consists of two segments of the large circle. Each segment is formed by a sector of the large circle minus the area of a small circle.

#### Step 2: Define Variables
Let:
- \( r \) be the radius of one of the small circles.
- \( R \) be the radius of the large circle.

From the diagram, we observe that the centers of the small circles form a regular hexagon around point \( P \). The distance from \( P \) to the center of any small circle is \( R - r \).

#### Step 3: Relationship Between Radii
Since the centers of the small circles form a regular hexagon, the distance between the centers of any two adjacent small circles is \( 2r \). This distance is also equal to the side length of the hexagon. The radius of the hexagon (distance from the center \( P \) to the center of any small circle) is \( R - r \).

In a regular hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius. Therefore:
\[ R - r = 2r \implies R = 3r. \]

#### Step 4: Area of One Small Circle
The area of one small circle is:
\[ \text{Area of one small circle} = \pi r^2. \]

#### Step 5: Area of the Large Circle
The radius of the large circle is \( R = 3r \). Thus, the area of the large circle is:
\[ \text{Area of the large circle} = \pi R^2 = \pi (3r)^2 = 9\pi r^2. \]

#### Step 6: Area of the Shaded Region
The shaded region consists of two identical segments of the large circle. Each segment is a sector of the large circle minus the area of a small circle.

##### Sector Area Calculation
Each shaded segment corresponds to a sector of the large circle with a central angle of \( 60^\circ \) (since the centers of the small circles form a regular hexagon, and each internal angle of a hexagon is \( 120^\circ \), making each sector \( 60^\circ \)).

The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
\[ \text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi R^2, \]
where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees. For a \( 60^\circ \) sector:
\[ \text{Area of one sector} = \frac{60^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi R^2 = \frac{1}{6} \times \pi (3r)^2 = \frac{1}{6} \times 9\pi r^2 = \frac{3\pi r^2}{2}. \]

##### Subtracting the Area of the Small Circle
Each shaded segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the small circle:
\[ \text{Area of one shaded segment} = \frac{3\pi r^2}{2} - \pi r^2 = \frac{3\pi r^2}{2} - \frac{2\pi r^2}{2} = \frac{\pi r^2}{2}. \]

Since there are two such shaded segments, the total area of the shaded region is:
\[ \text{Total shaded area} = 2 \times \frac{\pi r^2}{2} = \pi r^2. \]

#### Step 7: Comparing the Shaded Area to the Area of One Small Circle
The area of one small circle is \( \pi r^2 \). The total shaded area is also \( \pi r^2 \). Therefore, the shaded area is exactly equal to the area of one small circle.

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{1} \]
