QUESTION:
A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions. The height of the square pyramid is 5x+7. Length L is the side of the base of the pyramid.

Find an expression for L, in terms of the variable, x.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use the provided dimensions to find an expression for \( L \) in terms of \( x \).

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The height of the square pyramid is \( 5x + 7 \).
- The vertical segment labeled \( 2x + 3 \) represents the height of the smaller square pyramid that is cut off from the top.
- The side length of the base of the smaller square pyramid is 5.
- The side length of the base of the larger square pyramid is \( L \).

### Step 2: Understand the geometric relationship
The figure shows a frustum of a pyramid, which is formed by cutting off the top part of the pyramid. The key observation is that the smaller square pyramid (top part) and the larger square pyramid (original pyramid) are similar. This means their corresponding dimensions are proportional.

### Step 3: Use the similarity of pyramids
Let:
- \( h_{\text{large}} = 5x + 7 \) be the height of the larger pyramid.
- \( h_{\text{small}} = 2x + 3 \) be the height of the smaller pyramid.
- \( s_{\text{small}} = 5 \) be the side length of the base of the smaller pyramid.
- \( s_{\text{large}} = L \) be the side length of the base of the larger pyramid.

Since the smaller pyramid and the larger pyramid are similar, the ratio of their corresponding heights is equal to the ratio of their corresponding base side lengths:
\[
\frac{h_{\text{small}}}{h_{\text{large}}} = \frac{s_{\text{small}}}{s_{\text{large}}}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{2x + 3}{5x + 7} = \frac{5}{L}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( L \)
Cross-multiply to solve for \( L \):
\[
(2x + 3)L = 5(5x + 7)
\]
\[
(2x + 3)L = 25x + 35
\]
Divide both sides by \( 2x + 3 \) to isolate \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{25x + 35}{2x + 3}
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the expression (if possible)
The expression \( \frac{25x + 35}{2x + 3} \) is already in its simplest form because the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{25x + 35}{2x + 3}}
\]
