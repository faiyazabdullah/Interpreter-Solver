### Problem Analysis:
The geometric figure shown is a three-dimensional solid composed of a rectangular prism and a triangular prism attached to one of its faces. We need to find the total surface area of this composite figure.

#### Step 1: Identify the components of the figure
1. **Rectangular Prism**:
   - Dimensions: Length \( L = 12 \, \text{cm} \), Width \( W = 9 \, \text{cm} \), Height \( H = 5 \, \text{cm} \).
   - Surface area of the rectangular prism consists of six faces, but since one face is replaced by the trapezoidal prism, we need to calculate the remaining five faces.

2. **Trapezoidal Prism**:
   - The trapezoidal base has parallel sides of lengths \( 9 \, \text{cm} \) and \( 12 \, \text{cm} \), and a height of \( 3 \, \text{cm} \).
   - The slanted side of the trapezoid is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \).
   - The height of the prism (same as the height of the rectangular prism) is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 2: Calculate the surface area of the rectangular prism
The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{rectangular prism}} = 2(LW + WH + LH)
\]
However, one face of the rectangular prism (with dimensions \( 9 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} \)) is replaced by the trapezoidal prism. Therefore, we calculate the surface area of the remaining five faces:
\[
\text{Remaining Surface Area}_{\text{rectangular prism}} = 2(12 \cdot 5) + 2(9 \cdot 5) + 12 \cdot 9
\]
\[
= 2(60) + 2(45) + 108
\]
\[
= 120 + 90 + 108
\]
\[
= 318 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the surface area of the trapezoidal prism
The trapezoidal prism contributes four additional faces:
1. **Two lateral faces (rectangles)**:
   - One rectangle has dimensions \( 5 \, \text{cm} \) (height of the prism) and \( 9 \, \text{cm} \) (shorter parallel side of the trapezoid).
   - The other rectangle has dimensions \( 5 \, \text{cm} \) (height of the prism) and \( 12 \, \text{cm} \) (longer parallel side of the trapezoid).
   \[
   \text{Area of first rectangle} = 5 \cdot 9 = 45 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Area of second rectangle} = 5 \cdot 12 = 60 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area of these two rectangles} = 45 + 60 = 105 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

2. **Two trapezoidal bases**:
   - The area of one trapezoidal base is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area of trapezoid} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (\text{Base}_1 + \text{Base}_2) \cdot \text{Height}
     \]
     Here, \(\text{Base}_1 = 9 \, \text{cm}\), \(\text{Base}_2 = 12 \, \text{cm}\), and \(\text{Height} = 3 \, \text{cm}\).
     \[
     \text{Area of one trapezoid} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (9 + 12) \cdot 3 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 21 \cdot 3 = 31.5 \, \text{cm}^2
     \]
     Since there are two trapezoidal bases:
     \[
     \text{Total area of trapezoidal bases} = 2 \cdot 31.5 = 63 \, \text{cm}^2
     \]

3. **Slanted face of the trapezoidal prism**:
   - The slanted face is a rectangle with dimensions \( 5 \, \text{cm} \) (height of the prism) and \( 5 \, \text{cm} \) (slant height of the trapezoid).
   \[
   \text{Area of slanted face} = 5 \cdot 5 = 25 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

#### Step 4: Sum up all the surface areas
Now, we sum the surface areas from the rectangular prism and the trapezoidal prism:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Remaining Surface Area}_{\text{rectangular prism}} + \text{Surface Area}_{\text{trapezoidal prism}}
\]
\[
= 318 + 105 + 63 + 25
\]
\[
= 511 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{511.00}
\]
