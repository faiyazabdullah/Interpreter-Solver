QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $(1,1.5)$ and an amplitude of 1.5. What is the midline equation of the function?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a trigonometric function with a minimum point at \((1, 1.5)\) and an amplitude of \(1.5\). We are tasked with finding the midline equation of the function.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
1. **Minimum Point**: The function has a minimum point at \((1, 1.5)\).
2. **Amplitude**: The amplitude of the function is \(1.5\).

#### Step 2: Recall the properties of a trigonometric function
A general trigonometric function can be expressed as:
\[
y = A \sin(Bx - C) + D \quad \text{or} \quad y = A \cos(Bx - C) + D,
\]
where:
- \(A\) is the amplitude.
- \(D\) is the vertical shift, which determines the midline of the function.
- The midline is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the oscillation.

#### Step 3: Determine the midline
The amplitude \(A\) is the distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum value of the function. Given:
- The amplitude is \(1.5\).
- The minimum point of the function is \((1, 1.5)\).

Since the minimum point lies on the function, the value \(1.5\) is the lowest point of the oscillation. The midline is equidistant from the maximum and minimum values of the function. Let the midline be \(y = D\).

The relationship between the amplitude, the minimum value, and the midline is:
\[
\text{Minimum value} = D - A.
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
1.5 = D - 1.5.
\]
Solve for \(D\):
\[
D = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.
\]

#### Step 4: Write the midline equation
The midline is a horizontal line with the equation:
\[
y = D.
\]
From the calculation, \(D = 3\). Therefore, the midline equation is:
\[
y = 3.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y = 3}
\]
