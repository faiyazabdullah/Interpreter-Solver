QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of $y=\sin x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(90^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=5 \sin x$

### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves analyzing the transformation of the sine function and determining the first maximum point of the transformed function \( y = 5 \sin x \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Original Function
The original function is \( y = \sin x \). From the graph provided:
- The sine function has a period of \( 360^\circ \).
- The first maximum point of \( y = \sin x \) occurs at \( (90^\circ, 1) \).

#### Step 2: Analyze the Transformation
The given function is \( y = 5 \sin x \). This is a vertical stretch of the sine function by a factor of 5. Specifically:
- The amplitude of \( y = \sin x \) is 1.
- The amplitude of \( y = 5 \sin x \) is 5, meaning the maximum value of \( y \) is now 5 instead of 1.
- The period remains unchanged because the transformation only affects the vertical scaling, not the horizontal scaling.

#### Step 3: Determine the First Maximum Point
The first maximum point of \( y = \sin x \) occurs at \( (90^\circ, 1) \). Since the transformation \( y = 5 \sin x \) vertically stretches the function by a factor of 5:
- The \( x \)-coordinate of the maximum point remains the same (\( 90^\circ \)).
- The \( y \)-coordinate is scaled by 5, so the new maximum value is \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \).

Thus, the first maximum point of \( y = 5 \sin x \) is \( (90^\circ, 5) \).

#### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(90^\circ, 5)}
\]
