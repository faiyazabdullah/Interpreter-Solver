QUESTION:
Xavier's mother told him to drink 4 glasses of water each day. She gave him a cylindrical glass with radius 4 cm.

If Xavier follows this drinking routine for a week, how many litres of water would he drink altogether?

Round your answer to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with calculating the total amount of water Xavier drinks in a week if he drinks 4 glasses of water each day from a cylindrical glass. The dimensions of the cylindrical glass are provided: 
- Radius \( r = 4 \) cm
- Height \( h = 11 \) cm

#### Step 1: Calculate the volume of one glass
The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
Here:
- \( r = 4 \) cm
- \( h = 11 \) cm

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[
V = \pi (4)^2 (11) = \pi (16)(11) = 176\pi \text{ cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2: Convert the volume from cubic centimeters to liters
Since \( 1 \text{ liter} = 1000 \text{ cm}^3 \), we convert the volume as follows:
\[
V_{\text{liters}} = \frac{176\pi}{1000} = 0.176\pi \text{ liters}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the total volume of water Xavier drinks per day
Xavier drinks 4 glasses of water each day. Therefore, the total volume of water he drinks per day is:
\[
V_{\text{daily}} = 4 \times 0.176\pi = 0.704\pi \text{ liters}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the total volume of water Xavier drinks in a week
There are 7 days in a week. Thus, the total volume of water Xavier drinks in a week is:
\[
V_{\text{weekly}} = 7 \times 0.704\pi = 4.928\pi \text{ liters}
\]

#### Step 5: Approximate the value and round to one decimal place
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
V_{\text{weekly}} \approx 4.928 \times 3.14159 \approx 15.47 \text{ liters}
\]
Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
V_{\text{weekly}} \approx 15.5 \text{ liters}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{15.5}
\]
