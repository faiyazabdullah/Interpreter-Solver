### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the height \( h \) of a closed cylinder given its surface area \( S = 27288 \, \text{mm}^2 \) and the radius \( r = 43 \, \text{mm} \). The surface area \( S \) of a closed cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
S = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circular bases,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder,
- \( 2\pi r^2 \) is the combined area of the two circular bases,
- \( 2\pi rh \) is the lateral surface area.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Substitute the given values into the surface area formula.
The radius \( r = 43 \, \text{mm} \) and the surface area \( S = 27288 \, \text{mm}^2 \). Plugging these into the formula:
\[
27288 = 2\pi (43)^2 + 2\pi (43)h
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate \( 2\pi (43)^2 \).
First, compute \( 43^2 \):
\[
43^2 = 1849
\]
Then, calculate \( 2\pi (43)^2 \):
\[
2\pi (43)^2 = 2\pi \cdot 1849 = 3698\pi
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the equation.
Substitute \( 3698\pi \) back into the surface area equation:
\[
27288 = 3698\pi + 2\pi (43)h
\]
Factor out \( 2\pi \) from the terms involving \( h \):
\[
27288 = 3698\pi + 2\pi \cdot 43h
\]
\[
27288 = 3698\pi + 86\pi h
\]

#### Step 4: Isolate the term involving \( h \).
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( h \):
\[
27288 - 3698\pi = 86\pi h
\]
Divide both sides by \( 86\pi \):
\[
h = \frac{27288 - 3698\pi}{86\pi}
\]

#### Step 5: Approximate the value of \( \pi \) and perform the calculation.
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
1. Calculate \( 3698\pi \):
\[
3698\pi \approx 3698 \cdot 3.14159 \approx 11626.67
\]
2. Subtract this from 27288:
\[
27288 - 11626.67 \approx 15661.33
\]
3. Calculate \( 86\pi \):
\[
86\pi \approx 86 \cdot 3.14159 \approx 270.07
\]
4. Divide the result by \( 86\pi \):
\[
h \approx \frac{15661.33}{270.07} \approx 58.00
\]

#### Step 6: Round to the nearest whole number.
The calculated height \( h \approx 58.00 \) rounds to \( 58 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{58}
\]
