QUESTION:
A rectangle contains an ellipse. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). The center of the ellipse is (20,10), and its four vertices are (0,10), (20,10), (20,20), (40,10). A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the largest possible elliptical cake that can fit inside a rectangular box measuring $40 \, \text{cm}$ in length and $20 \, \text{cm}$ in width. The problem provides a geometric setup where the ellipse is inscribed within a rectangle, and we need to find the center of the ellipse that maximizes its size while fitting inside the given rectangular box.

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
1. **Rectangle Dimensions**:
   - The rectangle has vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(0, 20)$, $(40, 20)$, and $(40, 0)$.
   - Its dimensions are $40 \, \text{cm}$ (length) and $20 \, \text{cm}$ (width).

2. **Ellipse Properties**:
   - The ellipse is centered at $(20, 10)$.
   - Its vertices are $(0, 10)$, $(20, 20)$, $(20, 0)$, and $(40, 10)$.
   - This indicates that the major axis of the ellipse is horizontal (aligned with the x-axis) and the minor axis is vertical (aligned with the y-axis).
   - The semi-major axis (half the length of the major axis) is $20 \, \text{cm}$ (from $x = 0$ to $x = 40$, divided by 2).
   - The semi-minor axis (half the length of the minor axis) is $10 \, \text{cm}$ (from $y = 0$ to $y = 20$, divided by 2).

3. **Fitting the Ellipse into the Box**:
   - The ellipse must fit entirely within the rectangular box.
   - The center of the ellipse must be positioned such that the ellipse does not extend beyond the boundaries of the rectangle.

#### Step 2: Determine the Center of the Ellipse
The ellipse is already centered at $(20, 10)$ in the provided figure. To maximize the size of the ellipse, the center must remain at the midpoint of the rectangle. This ensures that the ellipse is symmetrically placed and touches the sides of the rectangle without extending beyond its boundaries.

- The midpoint of the rectangle is calculated as follows:
  - The midpoint of the x-coordinates of the rectangle is:
    \[
    \frac{0 + 40}{2} = 20
    \]
  - The midpoint of the y-coordinates of the rectangle is:
    \[
    \frac{0 + 20}{2} = 10
    \]
  - Therefore, the center of the rectangle (and hence the ellipse) is $(20, 10)$.

#### Step 3: Verify the Fit
- The ellipse with semi-major axis $20 \, \text{cm}$ and semi-minor axis $10 \, \text{cm}$, centered at $(20, 10)$, perfectly fits within the rectangle:
  - The horizontal extent of the ellipse is $40 \, \text{cm}$ (from $x = 0$ to $x = 40$), which matches the length of the rectangle.
  - The vertical extent of the ellipse is $20 \, \text{cm}$ (from $y = 0$ to $y = 20$), which matches the width of the rectangle.

#### Step 4: Conclusion
The center of the largest possible elliptical cake that can fit inside the rectangular box is $(20, 10)$.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(20, 10)}
\]
