QUESTION:
The side profile of a bridge is overlapped with the coordinate axes such that $(x, y)$ represents a point on the arc that is $x$ meters horizontally from one end of the bridge and $y$ meters vertically above the road. The bridge meets the road at coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(100,0)$, with the vertex at (50,50).

Pedestrians are able to climb the full arch of the bridge. Find the average steepness of the climb over the interval $[0,20]$.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the **average steepness** of the climb over the interval $[0, 20]$ on the bridge's arch. The arch is represented by a parabolic curve, and we are provided with key points:
- The arch passes through $(0, 0)$ and $(100, 0)$.
- The vertex of the parabola is at $(50, 50)$.

#### Step 1: Determine the Equation of the Parabola
The general form of a parabola opening downwards is:
\[
y = a(x - h)^2 + k
\]
where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. Here, the vertex is $(50, 50)$, so the equation becomes:
\[
y = a(x - 50)^2 + 50
\]

To find $a$, we use the fact that the parabola passes through $(0, 0)$. Substituting $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ into the equation:
\[
0 = a(0 - 50)^2 + 50 \implies 0 = 2500a + 50 \implies 2500a = -50 \implies a = -\frac{1}{50}
\]

Thus, the equation of the parabola is:
\[
y = -\frac{1}{50}(x - 50)^2 + 50
\]

#### Step 2: Compute the Derivative
The steepness of the climb at any point is given by the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$. Differentiating $y$:
\[
y = -\frac{1}{50}(x - 50)^2 + 50
\]
Using the chain rule:
\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{1}{50} \cdot 2(x - 50) = -\frac{2}{50}(x - 50) = -\frac{1}{25}(x - 50)
\]

#### Step 3: Average Steepness Over $[0, 20]$
The average steepness over the interval $[0, 20]$ is the average value of the derivative $\frac{dy}{dx}$ over this interval. The formula for the average value of a function $f(x)$ over $[a, b]$ is:
\[
\text{Average value} = \frac{1}{b - a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx
\]

Here, $f(x) = \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{1}{25}(x - 50)$, $a = 0$, and $b = 20$. Thus:
\[
\text{Average steepness} = \frac{1}{20 - 0} \int_0^{20} -\frac{1}{25}(x - 50) \, dx
\]

Simplify the integral:
\[
\text{Average steepness} = \frac{1}{20} \int_0^{20} -\frac{1}{25}(x - 50) \, dx = -\frac{1}{20 \cdot 25} \int_0^{20} (x - 50) \, dx
\]
\[
= -\frac{1}{500} \int_0^{20} (x - 50) \, dx
\]

Evaluate the integral:
\[
\int_0^{20} (x - 50) \, dx = \left[ \frac{x^2}{2} - 50x \right]_0^{20}
\]
\[
= \left( \frac{20^2}{2} - 50 \cdot 20 \right) - \left( \frac{0^2}{2} - 50 \cdot 0 \right)
\]
\[
= \left( \frac{400}{2} - 1000 \right) - 0 = 200 - 1000 = -800
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Average steepness} = -\frac{1}{500} \cdot (-800) = \frac{800}{500} = \frac{8}{5}
\]

#### Step 4: Interpretation
The average steepness of the climb over the interval $[0, 20]$ is $\frac{8}{5}$, which means for every meter of horizontal distance, the height increases by $\frac{8}{5}$ meters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{8}{5}}
\]
