QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the north direction is 31°.

Find the true bearing of point A from O.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( O \). The key information provided is:
- The angle between line \( OA \) and the north direction is \( 31^\circ \).
- The orientation of the compass indicates that the positive \( y \)-axis corresponds to the north direction.

#### Step 1: Understanding True Bearing
True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction. In this case:
- The angle given is \( 31^\circ \), which means line \( OA \) makes an angle of \( 31^\circ \) with the north direction.
- Since the angle is measured counterclockwise from the north direction, we need to convert it to a clockwise measurement.

#### Step 2: Converting to True Bearing
To find the true bearing:
1. Start at the north direction (0°).
2. Measure the angle clockwise from north.
3. Since the angle is given as \( 31^\circ \) counterclockwise from north, the true bearing is:
   \[
   360^\circ - 31^\circ = 329^\circ
   \]

#### Step 3: Verification
The true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction. The angle \( 329^\circ \) correctly represents the direction of point \( A \) relative to the north direction.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{329^\circ}
\]
