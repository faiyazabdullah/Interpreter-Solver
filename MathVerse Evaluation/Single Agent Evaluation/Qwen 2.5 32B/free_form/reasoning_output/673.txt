QUESTION:
We wish to find the surface area of the shape given, consisting of a hemisphere and a cylinder. The radius is 10.55 mm. The height of cylinder is 33.1 mm.

Hence find the total surface area of the shape, correct to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given shape consists of a **hemisphere** and a **cylinder**. We need to calculate the **total surface area** of this combined shape. Here's the breakdown of the given information:
- Radius of the hemisphere and cylinder: \( r = 10.55 \, \text{mm} \)
- Height of the cylinder: \( h = 33.1 \, \text{mm} \)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Surface Area of the Hemisphere
The surface area of a hemisphere includes the curved surface area but excludes the base (since it is attached to the cylinder). The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 10.55 \, \text{mm} \):
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi (10.55)^2
\]
Calculate \( (10.55)^2 \):
\[
(10.55)^2 = 111.3025
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi \times 111.3025 = 222.605\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### 2. Surface Area of the Cylinder
The surface area of the cylinder consists of:
- The lateral surface area (excluding the top and bottom bases).
- The bottom base area (since the top base is covered by the hemisphere).

##### Lateral Surface Area of the Cylinder
The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
\]
Substitute \( r = 10.55 \, \text{mm} \) and \( h = 33.1 \, \text{mm} \):
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi (10.55)(33.1)
\]
Calculate \( 10.55 \times 33.1 \):
\[
10.55 \times 33.1 = 349.105
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi \times 349.105 = 698.21\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

##### Bottom Base Area of the Cylinder
The bottom base area of the cylinder is a circle with radius \( r = 10.55 \, \text{mm} \). The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[
\text{Bottom Base Area} = \pi r^2
\]
We already calculated \( r^2 = 111.3025 \):
\[
\text{Bottom Base Area} = \pi \times 111.3025 = 111.3025\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### 3. Total Surface Area
The total surface area of the combined shape is the sum of:
- The curved surface area of the hemisphere.
- The lateral surface area of the cylinder.
- The bottom base area of the cylinder.

\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} + \text{Lateral Surface Area of Cylinder} + \text{Bottom Base Area of Cylinder}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 222.605\pi + 698.21\pi + 111.3025\pi
\]
Combine the terms:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = (222.605 + 698.21 + 111.3025)\pi = 1032.1175\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### 4. Numerical Approximation
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 1032.1175 \times 3.14159 \approx 3242.08 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{3242.08 \text{ mm}^2}
\]
