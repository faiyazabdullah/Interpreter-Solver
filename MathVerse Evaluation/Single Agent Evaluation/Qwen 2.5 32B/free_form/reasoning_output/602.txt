QUESTION:
A piecewise function, with 2 segments constructed by a line passing (-5,1), (-3,2), and (-1,4) and a line passing (-1,5), (3,3), and (5,1), as shown in the figure. Let $f$ be the function given by the following graph. What is the domain of $f$?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure**
The given image depicts a piecewise function consisting of two segments:
1. **First Segment**: A straight line passing through the points $(-5, 1)$, $(-3, 2)$, and $(-1, 4)$.
2. **Second Segment**: A curved line passing through the points $(-1, 5)$, $(3, 3)$, and $(5, 1)$.

#### **Step 2: Understand the Function's Structure**
The function $f(x)$ is defined in two pieces:
- For $x \in [-5, -1]$, the function is a linear segment.
- For $x \in [-1, 5]$, the function is a curved segment.

The transition point between the two segments occurs at $x = -1$, where both segments meet smoothly.

#### **Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
The problem asks for the **domain** of the function $f(x)$. The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values ($x$-values) for which the function is defined.

#### **Step 4: Analyze the Domain**
From the graph:
- The first segment starts at $x = -5$ and ends at $x = -1$.
- The second segment starts at $x = -1$ and ends at $x = 5$.

Since the function is continuous at $x = -1$ (both segments meet at this point), the domain includes all $x$-values from $-5$ to $5$, inclusive.

Thus, the domain of $f(x)$ is the interval $[-5, 5]$.

#### **Step 5: Final Answer**
The domain of the function $f(x)$ is the set of all $x$-values from $-5$ to $5$, inclusive. This can be written in interval notation as:
\[ \boxed{[-5, 5]} \]

### Final Answer: \[\boxed{[-5, 5]}\]
