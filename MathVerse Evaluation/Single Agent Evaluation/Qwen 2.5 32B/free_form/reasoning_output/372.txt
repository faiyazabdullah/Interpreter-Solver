### Problem Analysis:
The given geometric figure is a right triangle. The problem provides the following information:
- One of the legs of the triangle (adjacent to the angle \(\theta\)) has a length of \(12\).
- The hypotenuse of the triangle has a length of \(8\sqrt{3}\).
- The angle opposite the leg of length \(12\) is \(\theta\).

We are tasked with finding the value of \(\theta\) in degrees.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the relevant trigonometric relationship
In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. Here, the adjacent side to \(\theta\) is \(12\), and the hypotenuse is \(8\sqrt{3}\). Therefore, we can use the cosine function:
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{12}{8\sqrt{3}}
\]

#### Step 2: Simplify the expression for \(\cos(\theta)\)
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{12}{8\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}}
\]
To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the angle \(\theta\)
We now know that:
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
From trigonometric tables or knowledge of standard angles, we recognize that:
\[
\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus, \(\theta = 30^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{30^\circ}
\]
