QUESTION:
The line passes (2,-1), (5,1), (8,3), (11,5). Find the equation of the line in point-slope form .

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves finding the equation of a line in point-slope form. The points provided are \((2, -1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((8, 3)\), and \((11, 5)\). These points lie on a straight line, as indicated by the graph.

#### Step 1: Recall the Point-Slope Form of a Line
The point-slope form of a line is given by:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
where \(m\) is the slope of the line, and \((x_1, y_1)\) is a point on the line.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Slope \(m\)
The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is calculated using the formula:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Using the points \((2, -1)\) and \((5, 1)\):
\[
m = \frac{1 - (-1)}{5 - 2} = \frac{1 + 1}{5 - 2} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

#### Step 3: Choose a Point to Write the Equation
We can use any of the given points to write the equation in point-slope form. Let's choose the point \((2, -1)\).

#### Step 4: Substitute into the Point-Slope Form
Substitute \(m = \frac{2}{3}\) and the point \((2, -1)\) into the point-slope form:
\[
y - (-1) = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)
\]
Simplify:
\[
y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Consistency of the Points
To ensure the line is consistent, we can check if the other points satisfy the equation. Using the point \((5, 1)\):
\[
y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)
\]
Substitute \(x = 5\) and \(y = 1\):
\[
1 + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(5 - 2)
\]
\[
2 = \frac{2}{3}(3)
\]
\[
2 = 2
\]
This is true, so the point \((5, 1)\) lies on the line. Similarly, the other points \((8, 3)\) and \((11, 5)\) will also satisfy the equation.

### Final Answer:
The equation of the line in point-slope form is:
\[
\boxed{y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)}
\]
