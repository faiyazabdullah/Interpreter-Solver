QUESTION:
The line passes (0,2), (1,0). What is the slope of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure and Given Information**
The image shows a Cartesian coordinate plane with a straight line passing through two points: 
- \( (0, 2) \)
- \( (1, 0) \)

These points are explicitly marked on the graph, and the line's direction is clearly visible.

#### **Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships**
The problem asks for the **slope** of the line. The slope of a line is a measure of its steepness and is defined as the ratio of the vertical change (rise) to the horizontal change (run) between any two points on the line. Mathematically, the slope \( m \) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
where \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) are any two points on the line.

#### **Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
We need to calculate the slope of the line using the given points \( (0, 2) \) and \( (1, 0) \).

#### **Step 4: Apply Relevant Formulas**
Using the formula for the slope:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Let \( (x_1, y_1) = (0, 2) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (1, 0) \). Substituting these values into the formula:
\[
m = \frac{0 - 2}{1 - 0} = \frac{-2}{1} = -2
\]

#### **Step 5: Show Calculations Clearly**
1. Identify the coordinates:
   - \( (x_1, y_1) = (0, 2) \)
   - \( (x_2, y_2) = (1, 0) \)
2. Apply the slope formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - 2}{1 - 0} = \frac{-2}{1} = -2
   \]

#### **Final Answer:**
The slope of the line is \(\boxed{-2}\).
