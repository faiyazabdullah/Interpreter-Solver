QUESTION:
Two similar cylinders have volumes of 5760\mathrm{cm}^3 and 90\mathrm{cm}^3.


Find the fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder. The problem states that the two cylinders are **similar**, meaning their dimensions are proportional. The given volumes are:
- Volume of the larger cylinder: \( V_1 = 5760 \, \mathrm{cm}^3 \)
- Volume of the smaller cylinder: \( V_2 = 90 \, \mathrm{cm}^3 \)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understanding Similarity
For similar cylinders, the ratio of their volumes is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions (such as heights or radii). This relationship arises from the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
If the linear dimensions of the larger cylinder are scaled by a factor \( k \) compared to the smaller cylinder, then:
\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = k^3
\]
where \( k \) is the scaling factor for the linear dimensions.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Ratio of Volumes
The volumes of the larger and smaller cylinders are given as \( V_1 = 5760 \, \mathrm{cm}^3 \) and \( V_2 = 90 \, \mathrm{cm}^3 \), respectively. The ratio of the volumes is:
\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{5760}{90}
\]
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{5760}{90} = \frac{576}{9} = \frac{64}{1}
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = 64
\]

#### Step 3: Interpret the Result
Since the ratio of the volumes is \( 64 \), and knowing that the ratio of volumes for similar figures is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions, we can conclude:
\[
k^3 = 64 \implies k = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4
\]
This means the linear dimensions of the larger cylinder are 4 times those of the smaller cylinder.

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The problem asks for the ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder. We have already calculated this ratio:
\[
\frac{V_1}{V_2} = 64
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]
