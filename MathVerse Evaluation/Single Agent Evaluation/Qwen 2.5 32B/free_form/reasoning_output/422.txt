QUESTION:
The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a geometric figure consisting of three rectangular regions. The dimensions and areas of these regions are provided as follows:
- The first rectangle has an area of \(6000\).
- The second rectangle has an area of \(60\).
- The third rectangle has a smaller white square inside it, indicating that part of its area is unshaded.

The total area of the entire figure is given as \(6096\).

#### Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to determine the area of the shaded region in the third rectangle. To do this, we will:
1. Calculate the combined area of the first two rectangles.
2. Subtract this from the total area to find the area of the third rectangle.
3. Subtract the area of the white square from the area of the third rectangle to find the remaining shaded area.

#### Step 2: Calculate the combined area of the first two rectangles
The areas of the first two rectangles are:
- First rectangle: \(6000\)
- Second rectangle: \(60\)

The combined area of these two rectangles is:
\[
6000 + 60 = 6060
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the area of the third rectangle
The total area of the entire figure is \(6096\). Subtracting the combined area of the first two rectangles from the total area gives the area of the third rectangle:
\[
6096 - 6060 = 36
\]

#### Step 4: Account for the white square
The third rectangle contains a white square, which represents an unshaded area. Let the side length of the white square be \(s\). The area of the white square is \(s^2\). Since the area of the third rectangle is \(36\) and the white square is entirely within it, the remaining shaded area in the third rectangle is:
\[
36 - s^2
\]

However, the problem does not provide the side length \(s\) of the white square. Assuming the question asks for the total shaded area excluding the white square, we conclude that the remaining shaded area is simply the area of the third rectangle minus the area of the white square.

#### Step 5: Final calculation
Since the problem does not specify the size of the white square, we assume the question asks for the total shaded area excluding the white square. Therefore, the remaining shaded area is:
\[
36 - s^2
\]

If the white square's area is not specified, the remaining shaded area is simply the area of the third rectangle, which is \(36\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
