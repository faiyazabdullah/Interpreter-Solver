====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a sector of a circle. The key pieces of information are:
1. The center of the circle is \( O \).
2. The radius of the circle is \( 6 \) cm.
3. The arc \( JK \) has a length of \( 2\pi \) cm.

We need to determine the area of the sector \( OJK \).

---

### Step 1: Recall the formula for the arc length of a sector
The arc length \( L \) of a sector with radius \( r \) and central angle \( \theta \) (in radians) is given by:
\[
L = r\theta
\]
Here, we know:
- \( L = 2\pi \) cm
- \( r = 6 \) cm

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
2\pi = 6\theta
\]

Solve for \( \theta \):
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{6} = \frac{\pi}{3} \quad \text{(radians)}
\]

---

### Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a sector
The area \( A \) of a sector with radius \( r \) and central angle \( \theta \) (in radians) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
\]
Here, we know:
- \( r = 6 \) cm
- \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6^2 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}
\]

Simplify step by step:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 36 \cdot \frac{\pi}{3}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 12\pi
\]
\[
A = 6\pi
\]

---

### Step 3: Write the final answer
The area of the sector \( OJK \) is \( 6\pi \) square centimeters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{6\pi}
\]
