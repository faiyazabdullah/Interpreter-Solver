QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the triangular prism is 8cm and the length of its right triangle's sides are 2cm and 4cm respectively. Find the volume of the triangular prism.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The figure shows a **triangular prism**.
- The base of the prism is a **right triangle**.
- The dimensions of the right triangle are:
  - One leg = \(2 \, \text{cm}\),
  - The other leg = \(4 \, \text{cm}\).
- The height of the triangular prism is given as \(8 \, \text{cm}\).

#### **Step 2: Calculate the area of the triangular base**
The base of the prism is a right triangle. The area \(A\) of a right triangle is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base and height of the right triangle are the two legs of the triangle:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \, \text{cm}^2 = 4 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 3: Use the formula for the volume of a prism**
The volume \(V\) of a prism is given by:
\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height of the Prism}
\]
We already calculated the base area as \(4 \, \text{cm}^2\), and the height of the prism is \(8 \, \text{cm}\). Substituting these values:
\[
V = 4 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 8 \, \text{cm} = 32 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### **Step 4: Final Answer**
The volume of the triangular prism is:
\[
\boxed{32 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
