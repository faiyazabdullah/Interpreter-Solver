FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a prism. To find its volume, we need to determine the area of the cross-section (base) and then multiply it by the depth (height of the prism). The base appears to be a trapezoid, and the height of the prism is explicitly given as \(2 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Step 1: Identify the Given Information
- The height of the prism (\(h\)) is \(2 \, \text{cm}\).
- The dimensions of the trapezoidal base are:
  - Top base (\(b_1\)): \(7 \, \text{cm}\)
  - Bottom base (\(b_2\)): \(16 \, \text{cm}\)
  - Height of the trapezoid (\(h_{\text{trapezoid}}\)): This is the vertical distance between the two parallel sides, which is \(2 \, \text{cm}\) (as indicated by the dashed line in the image).

#### Step 2: Formula for the Area of a Trapezoid
The area \(A\) of a trapezoid is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (b_1 + b_2) \cdot h_{\text{trapezoid}}
\]
where:
- \(b_1\) is the top base,
- \(b_2\) is the bottom base,
- \(h_{\text{trapezoid}}\) is the height of the trapezoid.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid
Substitute the given values into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (7 + 16) \cdot 2
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 23 \cdot 2
\]
\[
A = 23 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Volume of the Prism
The volume \(V\) of a prism is given by:
\[
V = \text{Area of the base} \cdot \text{Height of the prism}
\]
Here, the area of the base is \(23 \, \text{cm}^2\) and the height of the prism is \(2 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
V = 23 \cdot 2
\]
\[
V = 46 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{46 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
