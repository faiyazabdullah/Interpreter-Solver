QUESTION:
After two meteoroids collide at point A, one starts travelling in the direction of point B, while the other starts travelling in the direction of point C, with an angle of 53^\circ  between the two directions. The meteoroid projected in the direction of B is moving at a speed of 7860 km/h, while the other is moving at a speed of 10170 km/h.


What distance will the meteoroid travelling towards point B have covered after 29 minutes?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the distance traveled by the meteoroid traveling towards point \( B \) after 29 minutes. The given information includes:
- Speed of the meteoroid towards \( B \): \( 7860 \, \text{km/h} \).
- Time elapsed: 29 minutes.

#### Step 1: Convert time from minutes to hours
Since the speed is given in kilometers per hour (\( \text{km/h} \)), we need to convert the time from minutes to hours:
\[
29 \, \text{minutes} = \frac{29}{60} \, \text{hours}.
\]

#### Step 2: Use the formula for distance
The distance traveled by an object is given by:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}.
\]
Here:
- Speed towards \( B \): \( 7860 \, \text{km/h} \).
- Time: \( \frac{29}{60} \, \text{hours} \).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = 7860 \times \frac{29}{60}.
\]

#### Step 3: Perform the calculation
First, simplify the multiplication:
\[
7860 \times \frac{29}{60} = \frac{7860 \times 29}{60}.
\]
Calculate the numerator:
\[
7860 \times 29 = 227940.
\]
Now divide by 60:
\[
\frac{227940}{60} = 3799.
\]

#### Step 4: Interpret the result
The distance traveled by the meteoroid towards point \( B \) after 29 minutes is \( 3799 \, \text{km} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{3799 \, \text{km}}
\]
