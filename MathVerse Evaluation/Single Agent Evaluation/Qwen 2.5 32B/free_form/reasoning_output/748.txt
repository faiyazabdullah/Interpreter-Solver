QUESTION:
The following is a right pyramid on a square base with side length 16cm. A right pyramid has its apex aligned directly above the centre of its base.

The edge length VA is 26cm.
Find the length of VW, the perpendicular height of the pyramid correct to two decimal places.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the perpendicular height \( VW \) of a right pyramid on a square base with side length \( AB = 16 \, \text{cm} \). The slant height \( VA = 26 \, \text{cm} \), and the apex \( V \) is directly above the center \( W \) of the square base.

#### Step 1: Identify Key Information
- The base \( ABCD \) is a square with side length \( AB = 16 \, \text{cm} \).
- The apex \( V \) is directly above the center \( W \) of the square base, making \( VW \) the perpendicular height of the pyramid.
- The slant height \( VA = 26 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Geometry
- Since \( W \) is the center of the square base, it is equidistant from all vertices of the square.
- The distance from \( W \) to any vertex of the square (e.g., \( A \)) is the radius of the circumcircle of the square. For a square with side length \( s \), this distance is given by:
  \[
  WA = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{16\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm}.
  \]
- In the right triangle \( VAW \), the sides are:
  - \( VA = 26 \, \text{cm} \) (hypotenuse),
  - \( WA = 8\sqrt{2} \, \text{cm} \) (one leg),
  - \( VW \) (the other leg, which we need to find).

#### Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
In the right triangle \( VAW \):
\[
VA^2 = VW^2 + WA^2.
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
26^2 = VW^2 + (8\sqrt{2})^2.
\]
Calculate each term:
\[
26^2 = 676, \quad (8\sqrt{2})^2 = 64 \cdot 2 = 128.
\]
Thus:
\[
676 = VW^2 + 128.
\]
Solve for \( VW^2 \):
\[
VW^2 = 676 - 128 = 548.
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
VW = \sqrt{548} \approx 23.41 \, \text{cm}.
\]

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The length of \( VW \), the perpendicular height of the pyramid, is:
\[
\boxed{23.41}
\]
