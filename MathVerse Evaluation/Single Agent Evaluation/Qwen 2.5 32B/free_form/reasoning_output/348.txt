QUESTION:
A helicopter is flying at an altitude of 198 metres, at an angle of depression of 44Â° to its landing pad. What is the distance d between the helicopter and the landing pad?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a right triangle formed by the helicopter, the landing pad, and the vertical height from the helicopter to the ground. The key elements are:
- The altitude of the helicopter above the landing pad: \( 198 \) meters.
- The angle of depression from the helicopter to the landing pad: \( 44^\circ \).
- The goal is to find the straight-line distance \( d \) between the helicopter and the landing pad.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Understand the Geometry:
The angle of depression is the angle below the horizontal from the helicopter to the landing pad. This angle is equivalent to the angle of elevation from the landing pad to the helicopter. Therefore, the angle between the straight-line distance \( d \) and the horizontal ground is \( 44^\circ \).

In the right triangle:
- The vertical side (opposite the angle) is the altitude of the helicopter: \( 198 \) meters.
- The hypotenuse is the straight-line distance \( d \).
- The angle between the hypotenuse and the adjacent side (horizontal ground) is \( 44^\circ \).

#### 2. Choose the Appropriate Trigonometric Function:
To find the hypotenuse \( d \), we use the sine function, which relates the opposite side to the hypotenuse:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, \( \theta = 44^\circ \), the opposite side is \( 198 \) meters, and the hypotenuse is \( d \). Thus:
\[
\sin(44^\circ) = \frac{198}{d}
\]

#### 3. Solve for \( d \):
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( d \):
\[
d = \frac{198}{\sin(44^\circ)}
\]

#### 4. Calculate \( \sin(44^\circ) \):
Using a calculator:
\[
\sin(44^\circ) \approx 0.6947
\]

#### 5. Substitute and Compute \( d \):
\[
d = \frac{198}{0.6947} \approx 284.97
\]

#### 6. Round to the Nearest Whole Number:
Rounding \( 284.97 \) to the nearest whole number gives:
\[
d \approx 285
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{285}
\]
