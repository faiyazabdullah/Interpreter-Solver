QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What is the average rate of change?

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The given graph shows the relationship between the price of a toy (in dollars) and the quantity demanded (in thousand units). The task is to determine the **average rate of change** of the price with respect to the quantity demanded. 

#### Step 1: Identify Key Information from the Graph
- The x-axis represents the quantity demanded (in thousand units).
- The y-axis represents the price (in dollars).
- The graph is a straight line, indicating a linear relationship between price and quantity demanded.
- We need to find the slope of this line, which represents the average rate of change.

#### Step 2: Select Two Points on the Line
From the graph, we can identify two points that lie on the line:
1. When the quantity demanded is \( x_1 = 5 \) thousand units, the price is \( y_1 = 15 \) dollars.
2. When the quantity demanded is \( x_2 = 20 \) thousand units, the price is \( y_2 = 25 \) dollars.

#### Step 3: Use the Slope Formula
The formula for the slope (average rate of change) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substitute the coordinates of the points:
\[
(x_1, y_1) = (5, 15), \quad (x_2, y_2) = (20, 25)
\]
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{25 - 15}{20 - 5} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

#### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The slope of the line is \(\frac{2}{3}\). This means that for every increase of 1 thousand units in the quantity demanded, the price increases by \(\frac{2}{3}\) dollars.

#### Final Answer:
The average rate of change is \(\frac{2}{3}\) dollars per thousand units.

\[
\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}
\]
