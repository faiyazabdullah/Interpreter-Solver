QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the south direction is 32Â°.

What is the true bearing of A from O?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a coordinate system with cardinal directions (N, S, E, W). Point \( O \) is the origin, and point \( A \) is located such that the angle between the line segment \( OA \) and the south direction is \( 32^\circ \). We need to determine the **true bearing** of point \( A \) from \( O \).

#### Key Points:
1. **True Bearing Definition**: True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.
2. **Given Information**:
   - The angle between \( OA \) and the south direction is \( 32^\circ \).
   - The south direction is aligned with the negative y-axis in the standard coordinate system.
   - The angle is measured in the clockwise direction from the south.

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Angle**:
   - The angle \( 32^\circ \) is measured clockwise from the south direction.
   - In the standard coordinate system, the south direction corresponds to \( 180^\circ \) (measured clockwise from the north).

2. **Calculate the True Bearing**:
   - To find the true bearing, we need to add the given angle \( 32^\circ \) to the south direction's angle \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     \text{True Bearing} = 180^\circ + 32^\circ = 212^\circ
     \]

3. **Verification**:
   - The true bearing \( 212^\circ \) indicates a direction that is \( 32^\circ \) clockwise from the south, which matches the given information.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{212^\circ}
\]
