QUESTION:
The dimensions of a trapezoidal prism are given in the following diagram (not drawn to scale). A trapezoidal prism consists of two trapezium faces and four rectangular faces. The trapezium face has edges of 10cm, 5cm and 18cm and height of 3cm. The bottom face has edges of 18cm and 8cm.

Find the surface area of the trapezoidal prism.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the surface area of the trapezoidal prism. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry and Given Information
The trapezoidal prism consists of:
- Two trapezoidal bases.
- Four rectangular lateral faces.

#### Dimensions of the Trapezoid:
- Top base of the trapezoid: \(10 \, \text{cm}\)
- Bottom base of the trapezoid: \(18 \, \text{cm}\)
- Height of the trapezoid: \(3 \, \text{cm}\)
- Slant sides of the trapezoid: \(5 \, \text{cm}\) and \(8 \, \text{cm}\)

#### Dimensions of the Prism:
- Height of the prism (distance between the two trapezoidal bases): Not explicitly given, but we will denote it as \(h\).

### Step 2: Calculate the Area of One Trapezoidal Base
The formula for the area of a trapezoid is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (\text{Top base} + \text{Bottom base}) \times \text{Height}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\text{Area of one trapezoid} = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 + 18) \times 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \times 3 = 42 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Since there are two identical trapezoidal bases, the total area of the two bases is:
\[
2 \times 42 = 84 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Areas of the Rectangular Faces
The trapezoidal prism has four rectangular lateral faces. The dimensions of these rectangles are determined by the slant sides and the height of the prism \(h\).

#### Rectangular Face 1:
- One side is the top base of the trapezoid: \(10 \, \text{cm}\)
- The other side is the height of the prism: \(h\)
\[
\text{Area of Rectangular Face 1} = 10 \times h
\]

#### Rectangular Face 2:
- One side is the bottom base of the trapezoid: \(18 \, \text{cm}\)
- The other side is the height of the prism: \(h\)
\[
\text{Area of Rectangular Face 2} = 18 \times h
\]

#### Rectangular Face 3:
- One side is the slant side of the trapezoid: \(5 \, \text{cm}\)
- The other side is the height of the prism: \(h\)
\[
\text{Area of Rectangular Face 3} = 5 \times h
\]

#### Rectangular Face 4:
- One side is the slant side of the trapezoid: \(8 \, \text{cm}\)
- The other side is the height of the prism: \(h\)
\[
\text{Area of Rectangular Face 4} = 8 \times h
\]

### Step 4: Sum the Areas of All Faces
The total surface area \(A\) of the trapezoidal prism is the sum of the areas of the two trapezoidal bases and the four rectangular lateral faces:
\[
A = \text{Area of two trapezoidal bases} + \text{Area of four rectangular faces}
\]
\[
A = 84 + (10h + 18h + 5h + 8h)
\]
\[
A = 84 + 41h
\]

### Step 5: Determine the Height of the Prism
The problem does not explicitly provide the height \(h\) of the prism. However, since the dimensions of the lateral faces are given, we can assume that the height \(h\) is consistent with the dimensions of the trapezoid. If no specific value for \(h\) is provided, we cannot compute a numerical value for the surface area. 

Assuming the problem intends for us to express the surface area in terms of \(h\), the surface area is:
\[
A = 84 + 41h
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{84 + 41h}
\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $84 + 41h$
