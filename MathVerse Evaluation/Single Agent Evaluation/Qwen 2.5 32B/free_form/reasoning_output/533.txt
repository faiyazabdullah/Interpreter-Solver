FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves analyzing a trigonometric function's graph to determine its amplitude. The key pieces of information provided are:
1. The function intersects its midline at $(-3.5, -0.8)$.
2. The function has a maximum point at $(4.1, 0.7)$.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Midline
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that lies midway between its maximum and minimum values. In this case, the function intersects its midline at $(-3.5, -0.8)$. Therefore, the midline is the horizontal line $y = -0.8$.

#### Step 2: Identifying the Maximum Point
The maximum point of the function is given as $(4.1, 0.7)$. This means the highest value of the function is $0.7$.

#### Step 3: Calculating the Amplitude
The amplitude of a trigonometric function is the distance from the midline to either the maximum or minimum value of the function. Since we know:
- The midline is $y = -0.8$,
- The maximum value is $0.7$,

we can calculate the amplitude as the vertical distance between the midline and the maximum point:
\[
\text{Amplitude} = \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Midline}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\text{Amplitude} = 0.7 - (-0.8) = 0.7 + 0.8 = 1.5
\]

#### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
The amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum (or minimum) value. Here, the midline is $y = -0.8$, and the maximum value is $0.7$. The vertical distance between these two points is indeed $1.5$, confirming our calculation.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1.5}
\]
