QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 30Â°, the marked right angled side has a length of 8.5, and the diagonal side has a length of P. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown P.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a right-angled triangle with the following details:
- One of the angles is \(30^\circ\).
- The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle (the shorter leg) is given as 8.5.
- We need to find the length of the hypotenuse, denoted as \(P\).

#### Step 1: Identify the relationships in a 30-60-90 triangle
A right triangle with a \(30^\circ\) angle is a **30-60-90 triangle**, which has specific side ratios:
- The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is half the length of the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.

#### Step 2: Assign variables and use the given information
- Let the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle be \(a = 8.5\).
- The hypotenuse is denoted as \(P\).
- According to the 30-60-90 triangle properties:
  \[
  \text{Hypotenuse} = 2 \times (\text{side opposite } 30^\circ)
  \]
  Therefore:
  \[
  P = 2 \times 8.5
  \]

#### Step 3: Perform the calculation
\[
P = 2 \times 8.5 = 17
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the result
The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is 8.5, and the hypotenuse is twice this length, which aligns perfectly with the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]
