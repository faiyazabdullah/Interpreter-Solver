### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a cylindrical shape with a hollow center. The outer cylinder has a radius of \(9 \, \text{cm}\), while the inner cylinder has a radius of \(4 \, \text{cm}\). Both cylinders share the same height, which is \(2 \, \text{cm}\). The task is to find the volume of the figure, which is essentially the volume of the outer cylinder minus the volume of the inner cylinder.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Volume of a Cylinder
The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height.

#### Step 2: Volume of the Outer Cylinder
The outer cylinder has a radius \(R = 9 \, \text{cm}\) and height \(h = 2 \, \text{cm}\). Using the volume formula:
\[
V_{\text{outer}} = \pi R^2 h = \pi (9)^2 (2)
\]
\[
V_{\text{outer}} = \pi (81)(2) = 162\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 3: Volume of the Inner Cylinder
The inner cylinder has a radius \(r = 4 \, \text{cm}\) and height \(h = 2 \, \text{cm}\). Using the volume formula:
\[
V_{\text{inner}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4)^2 (2)
\]
\[
V_{\text{inner}} = \pi (16)(2) = 32\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 4: Volume of the Hollow Cylinder
The volume of the hollow cylinder is the difference between the volume of the outer cylinder and the volume of the inner cylinder:
\[
V_{\text{hollow}} = V_{\text{outer}} - V_{\text{inner}}
\]
\[
V_{\text{hollow}} = 162\pi - 32\pi = 130\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 5: Numerical Approximation
To find the numerical value, we use \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
V_{\text{hollow}} = 130\pi \approx 130 \times 3.14159 = 408.4067 \, \text{cm}^3
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
V_{\text{hollow}} \approx 408.41 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{408.41 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
