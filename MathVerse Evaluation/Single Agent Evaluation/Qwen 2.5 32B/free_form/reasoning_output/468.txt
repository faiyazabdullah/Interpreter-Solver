QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.


Find the centre of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle centered at a point in the coordinate plane. The circle intersects the axes at four points, which implies that the center of the circle is equidistant from these points. The goal is to determine the coordinates of the center of the circle.

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
- The circle is symmetric about its center.
- The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis at four points, indicating that the center lies within the first quadrant.
- The circle's center appears to be close to the origin but not at the origin.

#### Step 2: Understand Measurements and Relationships
- The circle's radius is constant, and the center is equidistant from all points on the circumference.
- The symmetry of the circle suggests that the center is located at a point \((h, k)\), where \(h\) and \(k\) are the \(x\)- and \(y\)-coordinates of the center, respectively.

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine the coordinates of the center of the circle, \((h, k)\).

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties
1. **Symmetry of the Circle**: The center of the circle is the midpoint of any diameter.
2. **Intersection Points**: Since the circle intersects both axes, we can infer that the horizontal and vertical diameters pass through the center.
3. **Visual Estimation**: From the image, the center appears to be near the origin but shifted slightly inward.

#### Step 5: Perform Calculations
- The circle's center is visually estimated to be near \((2, 2)\).
- To confirm, note that the circle is symmetric and the center is equidistant from all intersection points. The visual estimate aligns with the symmetry observed.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis and visual inspection of the circle's symmetry and position, the center of the circle is:

\[
\boxed{(2, 2)}
\]
