QUESTION:
There is a linear function with a y-intercept of 3 and a x-intercept of 2. Determine the function expression of f shown in the figure.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the function expression of \( f \) shown in the figure, let's follow the solution steps systematically:

---

### Step 1: Identify the given information
From the problem statement:
- The linear function has a **y-intercept** at \( y = 3 \).
- The linear function has an **x-intercept** at \( x = 2 \).

From the graph:
- The line passes through the points \((0, 3)\) (y-intercept) and \((2, 0)\) (x-intercept).

---

### Step 2: Understand the relationship
A linear function can be expressed in the slope-intercept form:
\[
f(x) = mx + b
\]
where:
- \( m \) is the slope of the line,
- \( b \) is the y-intercept.

We know:
- The y-intercept \( b = 3 \),
- The line passes through the point \((2, 0)\).

---

### Step 3: Calculate the slope \( m \)
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Using the points \((0, 3)\) and \((2, 0)\):
\[
m = \frac{0 - 3}{2 - 0} = \frac{-3}{2} = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

---

### Step 4: Write the function expression
Now that we have the slope \( m = -\frac{3}{2} \) and the y-intercept \( b = 3 \), we can write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form:
\[
f(x) = mx + b = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3
\]

---

### Step 5: Verify the function
To ensure the function is correct, we check if it satisfies both the y-intercept and x-intercept:
1. **Y-intercept**: When \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   f(0) = -\frac{3}{2}(0) + 3 = 3
   \]
   This matches the y-intercept \((0, 3)\).

2. **X-intercept**: When \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   0 = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3}{2}x = 3 \implies x = \frac{3}{\frac{3}{2}} = 2
   \]
   This matches the x-intercept \((2, 0)\).

The function satisfies both conditions.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{f(x) = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3}
\]
