QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the diameter.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure**
The image shows a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) of a Cartesian coordinate system. The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis at four points. These points are symmetrically placed about the origin.

#### **Step 2: Identify Key Measurements**
From the image:
- The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-4, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\).
- The circle intersects the \(y\)-axis at \((0, 4)\) and \((0, -4)\).

These points indicate that the radius of the circle is the distance from the center \((0, 0)\) to any of these intersection points. For example, the distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((4, 0)\) is 4 units.

#### **Step 3: Determine the Radius**
The radius \(r\) of the circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. Using the point \((4, 0)\):
\[
r = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4^2} = 4
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Diameter**
The diameter \(d\) of a circle is twice the radius:
\[
d = 2r = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**
The circle's intersections with the axes confirm that the radius is 4 units. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the calculation \(d = 8\) is consistent with the geometry of the circle.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
