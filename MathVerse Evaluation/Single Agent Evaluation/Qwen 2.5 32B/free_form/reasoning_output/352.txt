QUESTION:
From the cockpit of an aeroplane flying at an altitude of 3000 m, the angle of depression to the airport is 57°. The aeroplane continues to fly in the same straight line, and after a few minutes the angle of depression to the airport becomes 67°.
Now find the distance between the two sightings.

Round your answer to the nearest metre.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the horizontal distance traveled by an airplane between two sightings of an airport. The problem involves trigonometry, specifically the use of tangent functions to relate the angles of depression to the distances involved.

#### Given Information:
1. Initial angle of depression from the airplane to the airport: \(57^\circ\).
2. Final angle of depression from the airplane to the airport: \(67^\circ\).
3. Altitude of the airplane: \(3000 \, \text{m}\).

#### Objective:
Find the horizontal distance traveled by the airplane between these two sightings, rounded to the nearest meter.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Define Variables and Diagram
Let:
- \( h = 3000 \, \text{m} \) be the altitude of the airplane.
- \( x \) be the horizontal distance from the initial position of the airplane to the point directly above the airport.
- \( y \) be the horizontal distance from the final position of the airplane to the point directly above the airport.
- The distance traveled by the airplane horizontally between the two sightings is \( x - y \).

From the diagram, we can use the tangent function to relate the angles of depression to the distances \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
\tan(57^\circ) = \frac{h}{x} \quad \text{and} \quad \tan(67^\circ) = \frac{h}{y}.
\]

#### Step 2: Express \( x \) and \( y \) in Terms of \( h \)
Using the tangent definitions:
\[
x = \frac{h}{\tan(57^\circ)} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{h}{\tan(67^\circ)}.
\]

Substitute \( h = 3000 \, \text{m} \):
\[
x = \frac{3000}{\tan(57^\circ)} \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{3000}{\tan(67^\circ)}.
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate \( x \) and \( y \)
First, compute \( \tan(57^\circ) \) and \( \tan(67^\circ) \):
\[
\tan(57^\circ) \approx 1.540 \quad \text{and} \quad \tan(67^\circ) \approx 2.356.
\]

Now calculate \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
x = \frac{3000}{1.540} \approx 1948.05 \, \text{m},
\]
\[
y = \frac{3000}{2.356} \approx 1273.29 \, \text{m}.
\]

#### Step 4: Find the Distance Traveled
The horizontal distance traveled by the airplane is:
\[
x - y = 1948.05 - 1273.29 = 674.76 \, \text{m}.
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Meter
Rounding \( 674.76 \) to the nearest meter gives:
\[
675 \, \text{m}.
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{675}
\]
