QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the sphere shown. The radius is 11 cm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
The image shows a sphere with a labeled diameter of \(11 \, \text{cm}\). The diameter is the straight line passing through the center of the sphere, connecting two points on the circumference.

From the problem statement, we are also explicitly told that the radius of the sphere is \(11 \, \text{cm}\). However, there seems to be a discrepancy here because the diameter should be twice the radius. Let's clarify:
- If the diameter is \(11 \, \text{cm}\), then the radius would be \( \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \, \text{cm} \).
- However, the problem states the radius is \(11 \, \text{cm}\).

To avoid confusion, we will use the radius as explicitly given in the problem: \( r = 11 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 2: Understand What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area \( A \) of a sphere is:
\[
A = 4\pi r^2
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

#### Step 3: Apply the Formula
Substitute \( r = 11 \, \text{cm} \) into the formula:
\[
A = 4\pi (11)^2
\]
Calculate \( 11^2 \):
\[
11^2 = 121
\]
So,
\[
A = 4\pi \cdot 121 = 484\pi
\]

#### Step 4: Approximate the Result
Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
A \approx 484 \times 3.14159 = 1520.53066
\]
Round the result to two decimal places:
\[
A \approx 1520.53
\]

#### Step 5: Present the Final Answer
The surface area of the sphere is:
\[
\boxed{1520.53 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
