QUESTION:
The graph shows the temperature of a room after the heater has been turned on. What is the slope of the shown function that passes the point (0, 1)?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image is a graph showing the relationship between temperature (in degrees Celsius) and time (in minutes). The graph is a straight line, indicating a linear relationship between the two variables. We are tasked with finding the slope of the function that passes through the point \((0, 1)\).

#### Step 1: Identify Key Information from the Graph
- The graph is a straight line, so the relationship between temperature \( T \) and time \( t \) can be expressed as:
  \[
  T(t) = mt + b
  \]
  where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.
- The y-intercept is given as \( (0, 1) \), so \( b = 1 \).
- To find the slope \( m \), we need two points on the line. From the graph, we can observe the following points:
  - Point 1: \((0, 1)\)
  - Point 2: \((20, 5.5)\)

#### Step 2: Use the Slope Formula
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substitute the coordinates of the two points:
\[
(x_1, y_1) = (0, 1) \quad \text{and} \quad (x_2, y_2) = (20, 5.5)
\]
\[
m = \frac{5.5 - 1}{20 - 0} = \frac{4.5}{20} = 0.225
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the Linearity
The slope calculated is consistent with the linear nature of the graph. The line passes through the origin at \((0, 1)\) and increases steadily as time increases, confirming the linear relationship.

#### Step 4: Write the Final Answer
The slope of the function is \( 0.225 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{0.225}
\]
