QUESTION:
The line passes (3,4) and (-1,-3). What is the slope of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
The problem states that the line passes through the points \((3, 4)\) and \((-1, -3)\). These points provide us with two coordinates that lie on the line.

#### Step 2: Recall the formula for the slope of a line
The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by the formula:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

#### Step 3: Assign the coordinates to the formula
Let \((x_1, y_1) = (3, 4)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (-1, -3)\). Substituting these into the slope formula:
\[
m = \frac{-3 - 4}{-1 - 3}
\]

#### Step 4: Perform the calculations
First, calculate the numerator:
\[
y_2 - y_1 = -3 - 4 = -7
\]
Next, calculate the denominator:
\[
x_2 - x_1 = -1 - 3 = -4
\]
Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:
\[
m = \frac{-7}{-4} = \frac{7}{4}
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the result
The slope of the line is positive, which matches the direction of the line shown in the graph (rising from left to right). The calculated slope \(\frac{7}{4}\) is consistent with the visual representation.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{7}{4}}
\]
