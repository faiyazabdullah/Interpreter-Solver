QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 50°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the true bearing of point \( P \) from point \( M \). Let us follow the solution steps carefully.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The angle \( \angle PMS = 50^\circ \).
- Point \( S \) represents the south cardinal direction.
- We need to find the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \).

True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction. Since \( S \) is south, the direction from \( M \) to \( S \) is directly south (i.e., \( 180^\circ \) from north).

---

### Step 2: Determine the position of \( P \) relative to \( M \)
The angle \( \angle PMS = 50^\circ \) is measured counterclockwise from \( MS \) (south) to \( MP \). To find the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \), we need to measure the angle clockwise from the north direction.

1. The direction \( MS \) is directly south, which corresponds to \( 180^\circ \) true bearing.
2. The angle \( \angle PMS = 50^\circ \) is counterclockwise from \( MS \). To convert this to a clockwise angle from north:
   - Start at north (0°).
   - Move to south (180°).
   - From south, move an additional \( 50^\circ \) counterclockwise.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the true bearing
To find the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \):
1. The total angle from north to \( P \) is:
   \[
   180^\circ + 50^\circ = 230^\circ
   \]
   This is because we start at north (0°), go to south (180°), and then move an additional \( 50^\circ \) counterclockwise from south.

---

### Step 4: Verify the result
The true bearing is measured clockwise from north. The calculation \( 180^\circ + 50^\circ = 230^\circ \) confirms that \( P \) is located at \( 230^\circ \) from north.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{230^\circ}
\]
