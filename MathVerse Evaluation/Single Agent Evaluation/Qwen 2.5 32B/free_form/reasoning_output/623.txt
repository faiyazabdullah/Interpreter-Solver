QUESTION:
Two piecewirse function $g$ and $f$ are graphed, $g$ is graphed in purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), $f$ is graphed in blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). t is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport.
The airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon.
What is the other time the airplanes have the same height?
Round your answer to the nearest ten minutes.
About _ minutes after noon

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the piecewise functions \( g(t) \) and \( f(t) \) as depicted in the graph and determine when they intersect again after \( t = 9 \) minutes.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- The graph shows two piecewise functions:
  - \( g(t) \): Graphed in purple.
  - \( f(t) \): Graphed in blue.
- Both functions represent the heights of airplanes over time \( t \) (in minutes since noon).
- We are told that the airplanes have the same height at \( t = 9 \) minutes.
- We need to find the next time \( t \) when \( g(t) = f(t) \).

### Step 2: Analyze the Graph
#### Function \( g(t) \):
- \( g(t) \) starts at \( (0, 10000) \).
- It drops to \( (40, 9000) \).
- It remains constant at \( 9000 \) until \( t = 80 \).
- It increases to \( (100, 11000) \).
- It remains constant at \( 11000 \) until \( t = 130 \).

#### Function \( f(t) \):
- \( f(t) \) starts at \( (10, 11000) \).
- It remains constant at \( 11000 \) until \( t = 50 \).
- It decreases linearly from \( (50, 11000) \) to \( (60, 10000) \).
- It remains constant at \( 10000 \) until \( t = 100 \).
- It drops linearly from \( (100, 10000) \) to \( (120, 0) \).

### Step 3: Find the Intersection Points
#### Intersection at \( t = 9 \):
- At \( t = 9 \), both \( g(t) \) and \( f(t) \) are at the same height. This is given in the problem.

#### Next Intersection:
We need to find the next time \( t \) when \( g(t) = f(t) \).

- **From the graph:**
  - Between \( t = 50 \) and \( t = 60 \), \( f(t) \) decreases linearly from \( 11000 \) to \( 10000 \).
  - During this interval, \( g(t) \) is constant at \( 9000 \). Therefore, there is no intersection here.
  - After \( t = 60 \), \( f(t) \) remains constant at \( 10000 \) until \( t = 100 \).
  - During this interval, \( g(t) \) is also constant at \( 9000 \). Therefore, there is no intersection here.
  - At \( t = 100 \), \( g(t) \) jumps to \( 11000 \), and \( f(t) \) remains at \( 10000 \). There is no intersection here.
  - After \( t = 100 \), \( f(t) \) decreases linearly from \( 10000 \) to \( 0 \) by \( t = 120 \).
  - During this interval, \( g(t) \) remains constant at \( 11000 \). There is no intersection here.

#### Key Observation:
The only possible intersection occurs when both functions are at the same height. From the graph, the next intersection occurs around \( t = 100 \), but we need to check the exact point.

### Step 4: Check the Exact Intersection
- At \( t = 100 \):
  - \( g(100) = 11000 \).
  - \( f(100) = 10000 \).
  - They do not intersect at \( t = 100 \).

- Between \( t = 90 \) and \( t = 100 \):
  - \( g(t) \) is constant at \( 9000 \).
  - \( f(t) \) is decreasing linearly from \( 11000 \) to \( 10000 \).
  - The functions intersect somewhere in this interval.

### Step 5: Solve for the Exact Time
- From the graph, the intersection occurs around \( t = 90 \) to \( t = 100 \).
- Since the problem asks for the answer rounded to the nearest ten minutes, the closest value is \( t = 90 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]
