QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, one leg measuring \sqrt{3}. Find the length of side x, leaving your answer as an exact value.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given triangle is a right-angled triangle with one angle of \(60^\circ\) and another angle of \(30^\circ\). The side adjacent to the \(60^\circ\) angle and opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is given as \(\sqrt{3}\). We need to find the length of the hypotenuse \(x\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - One angle is \(60^\circ\).
   - Another angle is \(30^\circ\).
   - The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle (adjacent to the \(60^\circ\) angle) is \(\sqrt{3}\).
   - The triangle is a right-angled triangle, so the third angle is \(90^\circ\).

2. **Understand the relationship in a 30-60-90 triangle:**
   In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in a specific ratio:
   - The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is half the hypotenuse.
   - The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.
   - The hypotenuse is twice the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.

3. **Assign variables based on the given information:**
   - Let the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle be \(a\). Here, \(a = \sqrt{3}\).
   - The hypotenuse \(x\) is twice the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle. Therefore, \(x = 2a\).

4. **Calculate the hypotenuse \(x\):**
   Since \(a = \sqrt{3}\),
   \[
   x = 2a = 2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}.
   \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   - The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is \(\sqrt{3}\).
   - The hypotenuse is \(2\sqrt{3}\).
   - The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle can be calculated as \(\sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 3\), which satisfies the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     (\sqrt{3})^2 + 3^2 = (2\sqrt{3})^2 \implies 3 + 9 = 12 \implies 12 = 12.
     \]
   The calculations are consistent.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{2\sqrt{3}}
\]
