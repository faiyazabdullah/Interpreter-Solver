QUESTION:
This is part of a piece of jewellery. It is made out of a metal plate base, and gold plated wire (of negligible thickness) runs around the outside.

What is the area covered by the metal plate base?

Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the area covered by the metal plate base, which forms the outer boundary of the given geometric figure. Let's analyze the figure step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
The figure consists of:
- Two semicircular regions.
- The radii of these semicircles are given as:
  - One semicircle has a radius of \(6 \, \text{mm}\).
  - The other semicircle has a radius of \(3 \, \text{mm}\).

The figure is composed of these semicircles arranged such that they share a common straight edge, forming a combined shape.

### Step 2: Calculate the Area of Each Semicircle
The formula for the area of a full circle is:
\[
\text{Area of a circle} = \pi r^2
\]
Since each region is a semicircle, the area of a semicircle is half the area of a full circle:
\[
\text{Area of a semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\]

#### Semicircle with Radius \(6 \, \text{mm}\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (6)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 36 = 18\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

#### Semicircle with Radius \(3 \, \text{mm}\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (3)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 9 = 4.5\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Combine the Areas
The total area covered by the metal plate base is the sum of the areas of the two semicircles:
\[
\text{Total Area} = 18\pi + 4.5\pi = 22.5\pi \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Approximate the Numerical Value
Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
22.5\pi \approx 22.5 \times 3.14159 = 70.685775 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
70.685775 \approx 70.69 \, \text{mm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{70.69}
\]
