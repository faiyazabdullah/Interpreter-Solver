FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a cylinder with the following dimensions:
- Radius (\( r \)) = 98 mm
- Height (\( h \)) = 80 mm

We are tasked with finding the surface area of the cylinder. The surface area of a cylinder consists of three components:
1. The area of the top circular base.
2. The area of the bottom circular base.
3. The lateral surface area (the curved surface).

### Formula for Surface Area of a Cylinder:
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]
where:
- \( 2\pi r^2 \) is the combined area of the top and bottom circular bases.
- \( 2\pi rh \) is the lateral surface area.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

#### Step 1: Calculate the area of the top and bottom circular bases.
The area of one circular base is:
\[
\text{Area of one base} = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 98 \):
\[
\text{Area of one base} = \pi (98)^2 = \pi \cdot 9604 = 9604\pi
\]
Since there are two bases (top and bottom), the total area of the bases is:
\[
\text{Total area of bases} = 2 \cdot 9604\pi = 19208\pi
\]

#### Step 2: Calculate the lateral surface area.
The lateral surface area is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral surface area} = 2\pi rh
\]
Substituting \( r = 98 \) and \( h = 80 \):
\[
\text{Lateral surface area} = 2\pi (98)(80) = 2\pi \cdot 7840 = 15680\pi
\]

#### Step 3: Combine the areas to find the total surface area.
The total surface area \( A \) is the sum of the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface area:
\[
A = 19208\pi + 15680\pi = 34888\pi
\]

#### Step 4: Approximate the numerical value.
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
A \approx 34888 \times 3.14159 = 109547.7352
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
A \approx 109547.74
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{109547.74 \text{ mm}^2}
\]
