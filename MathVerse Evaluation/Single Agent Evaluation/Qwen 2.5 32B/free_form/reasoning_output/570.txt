QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a scaled version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of the red function \( g(x) \), which is a scaled version of the blue function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The key points to analyze are:

1. **Blue Function \( f(x) \):** The blue curve is explicitly given as \( y = x^2 \).
2. **Red Function \( g(x) \):** The red curve appears to be a vertical scaling of \( f(x) \). This means it has the form \( g(x) = c \cdot x^2 \), where \( c \) is a constant.
3. **Point of Reference:** The point \( (2, 3) \) lies on the red curve \( g(x) \). This provides a constraint to determine the value of \( c \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: General Form of \( g(x) \)
Since \( g(x) \) is a scaled version of \( f(x) = x^2 \), we can write:
\[
g(x) = c \cdot x^2
\]
where \( c \) is a constant that scales the function vertically.

#### Step 2: Use the Given Point
The point \( (2, 3) \) lies on the red curve \( g(x) \). Substituting \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 3 \) into the equation \( g(x) = c \cdot x^2 \):
\[
3 = c \cdot (2)^2
\]
\[
3 = c \cdot 4
\]
Solving for \( c \):
\[
c = \frac{3}{4}
\]

#### Step 3: Write the Equation for \( g(x) \)
Substitute \( c = \frac{3}{4} \) back into the general form \( g(x) = c \cdot x^2 \):
\[
g(x) = \frac{3}{4} \cdot x^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{g(x) = \frac{3}{4}x^2}
\]
