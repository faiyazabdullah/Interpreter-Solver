FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The water trough is in the shape of a half cylinder. We are tasked with finding the surface area of the outside of the trough. The given dimensions are:
- Height of the trough: \( h = 2.49 \) m
- Radius of the cylindrical base: \( r = 0.92 \) m

#### Key Components of the Surface Area:
The surface area of the outside of the trough consists of:
1. **The curved surface area of the half cylinder**.
2. **The rectangular base area** (since the top is open).

### Step 1: Curved Surface Area of the Half Cylinder
The formula for the curved surface area of a full cylinder is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Full Cylinder} = 2\pi rh
\]
Since the trough is a half cylinder, we take half of this area:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Half Cylinder} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi rh = \pi rh
\]
Substitute the given values \( r = 0.92 \) m and \( h = 2.49 \) m:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area} = \pi \times 0.92 \times 2.49
\]
Calculate the product:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area} = \pi \times 2.2908 = 2.2908\pi \quad \text{(in square meters)}
\]

### Step 2: Rectangular Base Area
The rectangular base of the trough has a length equal to the height of the trough (\( h = 2.49 \) m) and a width equal to the diameter of the circular base (\( 2r = 2 \times 0.92 = 1.84 \) m). Therefore, the area of the rectangular base is:
\[
\text{Rectangular Base Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 2.49 \times 1.84
\]
Calculate the product:
\[
\text{Rectangular Base Area} = 4.5816 \quad \text{(in square meters)}
\]

### Step 3: Total Surface Area
The total surface area of the outside of the trough is the sum of the curved surface area and the rectangular base area:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area} + \text{Rectangular Base Area}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 2.2908\pi + 4.5816
\]
Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
\[
2.2908\pi \approx 2.2908 \times 3.1416 = 7.1998
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 7.1998 + 4.5816 = 11.7814
\]

### Step 4: Round to Two Decimal Places
Rounding \( 11.7814 \) to two decimal places gives:
\[
11.78
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{11.78 \text{ m}^2}
\]
