QUESTION:
During a rescue search, a helicopter flew b kilometres west from point X to point Y, then changed course and flew 10.7 kilometres north to point Z. If point Z is on a bearing of 335Â° T from point X:

Now, if the distance that the helicopter must fly between point Z and point X is d kilometres, calculate d to one decimal place.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric scenario where a helicopter flies from point \( X \) to point \( Y \), then from point \( Y \) to point \( Z \). The goal is to determine the straight-line distance \( d \) between points \( Z \) and \( X \).

#### Given Information:
1. The helicopter flies \( b \) km west from point \( X \) to point \( Y \).
2. The helicopter then flies \( 10.7 \) km north from point \( Y \) to point \( Z \).
3. Point \( Z \) is on a bearing of \( 335^\circ \) true from point \( X \).

#### Objective:
Calculate the straight-line distance \( d \) between points \( Z \) and \( X \) to one decimal place.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- Point \( X \) is the origin of our coordinate system.
- Point \( Y \) is located \( b \) km directly west of \( X \). Therefore, the coordinates of \( Y \) are \( (-b, 0) \).
- Point \( Z \) is located \( 10.7 \) km north of \( Y \). Therefore, the coordinates of \( Z \) are \( (-b, 10.7) \).

#### Step 2: Use the Bearing Information
- The bearing of \( Z \) from \( X \) is \( 335^\circ \). This means that the angle between the north direction at \( X \) and the line segment \( XZ \) is \( 335^\circ \).
- In standard position, a bearing of \( 335^\circ \) corresponds to an angle of \( 360^\circ - 335^\circ = 25^\circ \) below the positive \( x \)-axis.

#### Step 3: Determine the Coordinates of \( Z \) Using Trigonometry
- Let the coordinates of \( Z \) be \( (x, y) \).
- The distance from \( X \) to \( Z \) is \( d \).
- Using trigonometry for the right triangle formed by \( X \), \( Y \), and \( Z \):
  - The horizontal component (westward) of \( Z \) from \( X \) is \( -b \).
  - The vertical component (northward) of \( Z \) from \( X \) is \( 10.7 \).

#### Step 4: Calculate \( b \) Using the Angle
- The angle between the line segment \( XZ \) and the negative \( x \)-axis is \( 25^\circ \).
- Using the tangent function:
  \[
  \tan(25^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{10.7}{b}
  \]
  Solving for \( b \):
  \[
  b = \frac{10.7}{\tan(25^\circ)}
  \]
  Using a calculator:
  \[
  \tan(25^\circ) \approx 0.4663
  \]
  \[
  b = \frac{10.7}{0.4663} \approx 22.95 \text{ km}
  \]

#### Step 5: Calculate the Distance \( d \)
- The coordinates of \( Z \) are \( (-22.95, 10.7) \).
- The distance \( d \) between \( X \) (origin) and \( Z \) is given by the distance formula:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
  \]
  Substituting \( X(0, 0) \) and \( Z(-22.95, 10.7) \):
  \[
  d = \sqrt{(-22.95 - 0)^2 + (10.7 - 0)^2}
  \]
  \[
  d = \sqrt{(-22.95)^2 + (10.7)^2}
  \]
  \[
  d = \sqrt{526.6025 + 114.49}
  \]
  \[
  d = \sqrt{641.0925}
  \]
  \[
  d \approx 25.32 \text{ km}
  \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{25.3}
\]
