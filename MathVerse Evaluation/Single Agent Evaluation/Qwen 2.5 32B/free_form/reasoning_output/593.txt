QUESTION:
A vertical blue line in the graph. What is the equation of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image provided shows a Cartesian coordinate plane with a vertical blue line. The task is to determine the equation of this vertical line.

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
- The graph is a standard Cartesian coordinate plane with labeled axes.
- A vertical blue line is drawn passing through the origin (0, 0).
- Vertical lines are characterized by having a constant \( x \)-coordinate for all points on the line.

#### Step 2: Understand Measurements and Relationships
- The blue line is perfectly vertical and passes directly through the origin.
- Since it is vertical, its equation will be of the form \( x = c \), where \( c \) is a constant.
- From the graph, we observe that the line passes through the point \( (0, 0) \). Therefore, the constant \( c \) is 0.

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
- We need to determine the equation of the vertical line.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties
- The general form of a vertical line's equation is \( x = c \).
- Since the line passes through the origin, the value of \( c \) is 0.

#### Step 5: Show Calculations Clearly
- The vertical line passes through the point \( (0, 0) \).
- Therefore, the equation of the line is \( x = 0 \).

### Final Answer:
\[\boxed{x = 0}\]
