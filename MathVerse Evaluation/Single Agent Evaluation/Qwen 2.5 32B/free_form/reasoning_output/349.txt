### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a rectangle \(ABCD\) with specific dimensions and requires finding the angle of depression (\(x\)) from point \(B\) to point \(C\). Here's the breakdown of the information provided:
- \(AC = 3\): The horizontal side of the rectangle.
- \(BC = 5\): The diagonal of the rectangle.
- We need to find the angle of depression (\(x\)), which is the angle formed by the line segment \(BC\) with the horizontal line at point \(B\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the geometric relationships
Since \(ABCD\) is a rectangle:
- \(AB\) is vertical.
- \(AC\) is horizontal.
- \(BC\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(ABC\).
- The angle of depression \(x\) is the angle between the horizontal line at \(B\) and the line segment \(BC\).

#### Step 2: Use trigonometry to find the angle
In the right triangle \(ABC\):
- The side opposite to angle \(x\) is \(AB\) (vertical side).
- The adjacent side to angle \(x\) is \(AC\) (horizontal side).
- The hypotenuse is \(BC\).

We can use the tangent function to relate the angle \(x\) to the sides of the triangle:
\[
\tan(x) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{AB}{AC}
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the length of \(AB\)
Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ABC\):
\[
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2
\]
Substitute the known values \(BC = 5\) and \(AC = 3\):
\[
5^2 = AB^2 + 3^2
\]
\[
25 = AB^2 + 9
\]
\[
AB^2 = 16
\]
\[
AB = \sqrt{16} = 4
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate \(\tan(x)\)
Now that we know \(AB = 4\) and \(AC = 3\), we can find \(\tan(x)\):
\[
\tan(x) = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

#### Step 5: Find the angle \(x\)
To find the angle \(x\), we use the inverse tangent function:
\[
x = \arctan\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)
\]

#### Step 6: Compute the value of \(x\)
Using a calculator:
\[
x \approx 53.13^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{53.13^\circ}
\]
