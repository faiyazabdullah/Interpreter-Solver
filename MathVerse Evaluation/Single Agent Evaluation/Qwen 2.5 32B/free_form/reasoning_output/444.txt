QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\tan a$.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the value of \( \tan a \), where the angle \( a \) is in standard position with its terminal side passing through the point \( P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right) \). The circle is centered at the origin with a radius of 1, indicating that \( P \) lies on the unit circle.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
- The point \( P \) is given as \( \left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right) \).
- The coordinates of \( P \) represent the \( x \)-coordinate and \( y \)-coordinate of a point on the unit circle.
- The radius of the circle is 1, which means the distance from the origin to \( P \) is 1. This can be verified using the distance formula:
  \[
  \sqrt{\left(-\frac{21}{29}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{20}{29}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{441}{841} + \frac{400}{841}} = \sqrt{\frac{841}{841}} = 1.
  \]
  This confirms that \( P \) lies on the unit circle.

#### Step 2: Recall the Definition of \( \tan a \)
The tangent of an angle \( a \) in standard position is defined as:
\[
\tan a = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{y}{x},
\]
where \( (x, y) \) are the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.

#### Step 3: Substitute the Coordinates of \( P \)
The coordinates of \( P \) are \( \left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right) \). Here:
- \( x = -\frac{21}{29} \)
- \( y = \frac{20}{29} \)

Thus, the tangent of the angle \( a \) is:
\[
\tan a = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{\frac{20}{29}}{-\frac{21}{29}} = \frac{20}{29} \cdot \frac{-29}{21} = \frac{20 \cdot (-1)}{21} = -\frac{20}{21}.
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Result
The calculation is straightforward and consistent with the definition of the tangent function. The negative sign arises because the \( x \)-coordinate is negative, indicating that the angle \( a \) lies in the second quadrant, where the tangent function is negative.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{20}{21}}
\]
