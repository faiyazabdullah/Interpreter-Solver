QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{2}{3} \pi, 1.2\right)$, and it has a minimum point at $\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi,-3.4\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

### Problem Analysis:
We are given the graph of a trigonometric function, specifically a sine or cosine wave. The problem provides two key pieces of information:
1. The function intersects its midline at the point \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\pi, 1.2\right)\).
2. The function has a minimum point at \(\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4\right)\).

We need to determine the amplitude of the function. Let's proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Midline
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that lies halfway between its maximum and minimum values. The y-coordinate of the midline is the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function.

From the given points:
- The function intersects the midline at \(y = 1.2\). This means the midline is \(y = 1.2\).

Thus, the midline equation is:
\[ y = 1.2 \]

---

### Step 2: Identifying the Minimum Point
The function has a minimum point at \(\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4\right)\). This means the minimum value of the function is \(-3.4\).

Since the midline is \(y = 1.2\), the distance from the midline to the minimum point gives us half the amplitude. The amplitude is the full vertical distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum value.

---

### Step 3: Calculating the Amplitude
The amplitude \(A\) is half the vertical distance between the maximum and minimum values. To find this, we first calculate the vertical distance from the midline to the minimum point:
\[ \text{Distance from midline to minimum} = |1.2 - (-3.4)| = 1.2 + 3.4 = 4.6 \]

This distance (4.6) represents the full vertical distance from the midline to the minimum. Since the amplitude is half of this distance:
\[ A = \frac{4.6}{2} = 2.3 \]

---

### Step 4: Verifying the Maximum Value
To confirm, we can calculate the maximum value. The maximum value is symmetrically located above the midline by the same distance as the minimum is below it. Thus, the maximum value is:
\[ \text{Maximum value} = 1.2 + 2.3 = 3.5 \]

This confirms that the amplitude is indeed \(2.3\).

---

### Final Answer:
The amplitude of the function is:
\[ \boxed{2.3} \]
