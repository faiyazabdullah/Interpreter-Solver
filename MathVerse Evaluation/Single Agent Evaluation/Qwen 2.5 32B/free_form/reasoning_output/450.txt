QUESTION:
The line passes (0,5) and (2.5,0). Find the equation of the line.
Use exact numbers.
y = _ x + _

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the given points
From the problem statement and the image, we are given two points through which the line passes:
- Point 1: \( (0, 5) \)
- Point 2: \( (2.5, 0) \)

#### Step 2: Recall the general form of a line's equation
The equation of a straight line can be written in the slope-intercept form:
\[
y = mx + b
\]
where:
- \( m \) is the slope of the line,
- \( b \) is the y-intercept (the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \)).

#### Step 3: Calculate the slope (\( m \))
The formula for the slope \( m \) between two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substitute the given points \( (x_1, y_1) = (0, 5) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (2.5, 0) \):
\[
m = \frac{0 - 5}{2.5 - 0} = \frac{-5}{2.5} = -2
\]
Thus, the slope \( m \) is:
\[
m = -2
\]

#### Step 4: Determine the y-intercept (\( b \))
From the point \( (0, 5) \), we observe that when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 5 \). This directly tells us the y-intercept \( b \):
\[
b = 5
\]

#### Step 5: Write the equation of the line
Now that we have the slope \( m = -2 \) and the y-intercept \( b = 5 \), we can substitute these values into the slope-intercept form of the line:
\[
y = mx + b
\]
\[
y = -2x + 5
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the equation using the second point
To ensure the equation is correct, we check if the point \( (2.5, 0) \) satisfies the equation \( y = -2x + 5 \):
\[
y = -2(2.5) + 5 = -5 + 5 = 0
\]
Since the point \( (2.5, 0) \) satisfies the equation, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{-2 \quad 5}
\]
