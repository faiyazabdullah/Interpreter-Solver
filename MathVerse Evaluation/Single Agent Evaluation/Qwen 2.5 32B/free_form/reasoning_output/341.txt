QUESTION:
Consider the following diagram. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 42° and angle B is 53°.


Find the true bearing of point C from point A.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( A \). Let us proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- Triangle \( ABC \) is formed by the dashed lines.
- The angles at points \( A \) and \( B \) are given:
  - \( \angle A = 42^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = 53^\circ \)

The goal is to find the true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( A \).

---

### Step 2: Determine the angle at point \( C \)
In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is always \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can calculate \( \angle C \) as follows:
\[
\angle C = 180^\circ - \angle A - \angle B
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\angle C = 180^\circ - 42^\circ - 53^\circ = 85^\circ
\]

So, \( \angle C = 85^\circ \).

---

### Step 3: Understand the bearing system
The true bearing of a point is measured clockwise from the north direction. In the diagram:
- The north directions are indicated by the vertical arrows at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- The dashed lines represent the sides of the triangle \( ABC \).

To find the true bearing of \( C \) from \( A \), we need to determine the direction of \( \overrightarrow{AC} \) relative to the north direction at \( A \).

---

### Step 4: Relate the angles to the bearing
From the diagram:
- The angle \( \angle A = 42^\circ \) is the angle between the north direction at \( A \) and the side \( AB \).
- Since \( \overrightarrow{AB} \) is directed to the right (eastward), the angle \( \angle A = 42^\circ \) indicates that \( AB \) is \( 42^\circ \) east of north.

Next, we need to determine the direction of \( \overrightarrow{AC} \). The angle \( \angle A = 42^\circ \) is the interior angle at \( A \) of the triangle. To find the true bearing of \( C \) from \( A \), we need to consider the external angle formed by extending \( AC \) beyond \( A \).

The external angle at \( A \) is:
\[
180^\circ - \angle A = 180^\circ - 42^\circ = 138^\circ
\]
This means that the direction of \( \overrightarrow{AC} \) is \( 138^\circ \) clockwise from the north direction at \( A \).

---

### Step 5: Conclude the true bearing
The true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( A \) is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction at \( A \). From the above calculation, this angle is \( 138^\circ \).

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{138^\circ}
\]
