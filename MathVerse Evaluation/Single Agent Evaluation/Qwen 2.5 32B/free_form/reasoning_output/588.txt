QUESTION:
The graphs of logarithm function $f(x)=\ln x$ passing (1,4) and logarithm function $g(x)$ passing (1,0) are shown below. $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$.

Hence state the equation of $g(x)$.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the equation of the function \( g(x) \), which is a transformation of the natural logarithmic function \( f(x) = \ln x \). The graph shows both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \), and we know the following:
1. \( f(x) = \ln x \).
2. \( g(x) \) passes through the point \( (1, 0) \).
3. \( g(x) \) is a vertical shift of \( f(x) \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Transformation
From the graph, we observe that \( g(x) \) is a vertical shift of \( f(x) = \ln x \). Specifically:
- The graph of \( f(x) = \ln x \) passes through the point \( (1, 0) \).
- The graph of \( g(x) \) also passes through the point \( (1, 0) \), but it is shifted upward compared to \( f(x) \).

#### Step 2: Determine the Vertical Shift
To determine the vertical shift, we compare the values of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) at a specific point. Let's choose \( x = 1 \):
- For \( f(x) = \ln x \), when \( x = 1 \), we have \( f(1) = \ln 1 = 0 \).
- For \( g(x) \), when \( x = 1 \), we have \( g(1) = 0 \).

Since both functions pass through \( (1, 0) \), we need to examine another point to determine the vertical shift. Let's choose \( x = e \):
- For \( f(x) = \ln x \), when \( x = e \), we have \( f(e) = \ln e = 1 \).
- For \( g(x) \), when \( x = e \), the value appears to be approximately 4 from the graph.

Thus, the vertical shift is \( 4 - 1 = 3 \). This means \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) upward by 3 units.

#### Step 3: Write the Equation of \( g(x) \)
If \( g(x) \) is a vertical shift of \( f(x) \) by 3 units upward, the equation of \( g(x) \) can be written as:
\[
g(x) = f(x) + 3
\]
Substituting \( f(x) = \ln x \), we get:
\[
g(x) = \ln x + 3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{g(x) = \ln x + 3}
\]
