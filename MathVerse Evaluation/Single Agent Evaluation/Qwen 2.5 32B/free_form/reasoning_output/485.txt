QUESTION:
There is a curve start from a solid point (1,0) with an end arrow going through (-4,4). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a curve starting at the point \((1, 0)\) and ending at the point \((-4, 4)\). The curve is continuous and appears to be a decreasing function. We need to determine the **domain** and **range** of the function represented by this curve.

#### Step 1: Identify the Domain
The domain of a function is the set of all possible \(x\)-values for which the function is defined. From the graph:
- The curve starts at \(x = 1\) and ends at \(x = -4\).
- The curve is continuous over this interval.

Thus, the domain is the interval from \(-4\) to \(1\), inclusive. In interval notation:
\[
\text{Domain: } [-4, 1]
\]

#### Step 2: Identify the Range
The range of a function is the set of all possible \(y\)-values that the function can take. From the graph:
- The curve starts at \(y = 0\) (at \(x = 1\)) and ends at \(y = 4\) (at \(x = -4\)).
- The curve is continuous and decreases as \(x\) increases, meaning all \(y\)-values between \(0\) and \(4\) (inclusive) are covered.

Thus, the range is the interval from \(0\) to \(4\), inclusive. In interval notation:
\[
\text{Range: } [0, 4]
\]

### Final Answer:
Combining the domain and range, we have:
\[
\text{Domain: } [-4, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 4]
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{\text{Domain: } [-4, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 4]}\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\text{Domain: } [-4, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 4]$
