QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -1.5 and the y-intercept is 3. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a graph of a line in the coordinate plane. The shaded region lies above the line, indicating that the inequality we are looking for involves a "greater than" condition. The line passes through the points \((-1.5, 0)\) and \((0, 3)\), which are the x-intercept and y-intercept, respectively. We need to determine the equation of the line and then formulate the inequality that describes the shaded region.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Determine the equation of the line.**

The general form of a linear equation is:
\[ y = mx + b \]
where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

From the problem, the y-intercept \( b \) is given as 3. Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ y = mx + 3 \]

Next, we calculate the slope \( m \). The slope is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
Using the points \((-1.5, 0)\) and \((0, 3)\):
\[ m = \frac{3 - 0}{0 - (-1.5)} = \frac{3}{1.5} = 2 \]

So, the equation of the line is:
\[ y = 2x + 3 \]

#### **Step 2: Determine the inequality.**

The shaded region is above the line, which means the inequality is:
\[ y > 2x + 3 \]

### Final Answer:
The inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane is:
\[ \boxed{y > 2x + 3} \]
