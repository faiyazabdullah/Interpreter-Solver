QUESTION:
Luke sailed for 116 kilometres on a bearing of 231^\circ .

If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, find $w$ to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Problem and Diagram**
The problem states that Luke sailed for 116 kilometers on a bearing of \(231^\circ\). We need to determine how far west (\(w\)) he has sailed from his starting point.

- The bearing \(231^\circ\) is measured clockwise from the north direction.
- The diagram shows a right triangle formed by the displacement vector, its horizontal component (westward), and its vertical component (southward).
- The hypotenuse of the triangle is the total distance sailed, which is 116 km.
- The angle between the displacement vector and the westward direction is \(231^\circ - 180^\circ = 51^\circ\) (since \(180^\circ\) is directly west).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
In the right triangle:
- The hypotenuse is the total distance sailed, \(116\) km.
- The angle between the hypotenuse and the westward direction is \(51^\circ\).
- The westward component (\(w\)) is the adjacent side to the angle \(51^\circ\).

Using trigonometry, the westward component \(w\) can be calculated using the cosine function:
\[
w = 116 \cdot \cos(51^\circ)
\]

#### **Step 3: Perform the Calculation**
First, compute \(\cos(51^\circ)\):
\[
\cos(51^\circ) \approx 0.6293
\]

Now, calculate \(w\):
\[
w = 116 \cdot 0.6293 \approx 73.1548
\]

Round \(w\) to one decimal place:
\[
w \approx 73.2
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the Result**
The calculation is consistent with the trigonometric relationship in the right triangle. The cosine of the angle gives the ratio of the adjacent side (westward component) to the hypotenuse (total distance sailed).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{73.2}
\]
