QUESTION:
The line passes (0,-5) and (5,0). Find the equation of the line.
Use exact numbers.
y = _ x + _

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the given points**
From the problem statement and the graph, we are given two points that lie on the line:
- Point 1: \((0, -5)\)
- Point 2: \((5, 0)\)

#### **Step 2: Understand the goal**
We need to find the equation of the line passing through these two points. The general form of a linear equation is:
\[ y = mx + b \]
where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the slope (\( m \))**
The formula for the slope \( m \) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Substitute the given points \((x_1, y_1) = (0, -5)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (5, 0)\):
\[ m = \frac{0 - (-5)}{5 - 0} = \frac{0 + 5}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1 \]

So, the slope \( m \) is:
\[ m = 1 \]

#### **Step 4: Determine the y-intercept (\( b \))**
The y-intercept \( b \) is the value of \( y \) when \( x = 0 \). From the point \((0, -5)\), we see that when \( x = 0 \), \( y = -5 \). Therefore, the y-intercept \( b \) is:
\[ b = -5 \]

#### **Step 5: Write the equation of the line**
Now that we have the slope \( m = 1 \) and the y-intercept \( b = -5 \), we can write the equation of the line in the form \( y = mx + b \):
\[ y = 1x - 5 \]
or simply:
\[ y = x - 5 \]

#### **Step 6: Verify the solution**
To ensure the equation is correct, we check if both given points satisfy the equation \( y = x - 5 \):
1. For the point \((0, -5)\):
   \[ y = 0 - 5 = -5 \]
   This is correct.
2. For the point \((5, 0)\):
   \[ y = 5 - 5 = 0 \]
   This is also correct.

Since both points satisfy the equation, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y = x - 5}
\]
