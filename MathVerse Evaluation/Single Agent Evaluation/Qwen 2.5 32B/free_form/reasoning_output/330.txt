QUESTION:
A rally car starts at point P and races 191 kilometres south to point Q. Here the car turns west and races for 83 kilometres to point R. At point R the car must turn to head directly back to point P.

What is the compass bearing of R from P? Give your answer to one decimal place.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the compass bearing of point \( R \) from point \( P \). The problem provides the following information:
- The car travels 191 km south from \( P \) to \( Q \).
- The car then travels 83 km west from \( Q \) to \( R \).
- We need to find the compass bearing of \( R \) from \( P \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- Point \( P \) is the starting point.
- Point \( Q \) is directly south of \( P \), 191 km away.
- Point \( R \) is directly west of \( Q \), 83 km away.
- The car's final path from \( R \) to \( P \) forms a straight line, and we need to determine the compass bearing of this path.

#### Step 2: Define Coordinates
To simplify the problem, we can assign coordinates to the points:
- Let \( P \) be at the origin: \( P = (0, 0) \).
- Since \( Q \) is 191 km south of \( P \), its coordinates are: \( Q = (0, -191) \).
- Since \( R \) is 83 km west of \( Q \), its coordinates are: \( R = (-83, -191) \).

#### Step 3: Determine the Vector from \( R \) to \( P \)
The vector from \( R \) to \( P \) is given by:
\[
\vec{RP} = P - R = (0 - (-83), 0 - (-191)) = (83, 191)
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Angle \( \alpha \)
The angle \( \alpha \) is the angle between the positive \( x \)-axis and the line segment \( RP \). This angle can be calculated using the arctangent function:
\[
\tan(\alpha) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{191}{83}
\]
\[
\alpha = \arctan\left(\frac{191}{83}\right)
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
\alpha \approx \arctan(2.2994) \approx 66.4^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Determine the Compass Bearing
The compass bearing is measured clockwise from north. Since \( R \) is in the third quadrant relative to \( P \):
- The angle \( \alpha \) is the angle east of south.
- Therefore, the compass bearing is:
\[
180^\circ + \alpha = 180^\circ + 66.4^\circ = 246.4^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{246.4^\circ}
\]
