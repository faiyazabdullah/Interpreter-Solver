### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a smooth curve that passes through specific points: (-4, 1), (-1, 3), and (0, 0). The task is to estimate the intervals on which the function represented by this curve is increasing or decreasing. To solve this, we analyze the behavior of the curve visually and apply concepts from calculus (specifically, the relationship between the slope of the tangent and the increasing/decreasing nature of the function).

#### Step 1: Understand the Curve's Behavior
- **Increasing Interval**: The function is increasing when the slope of the tangent to the curve is positive.
- **Decreasing Interval**: The function is decreasing when the slope of the tangent to the curve is negative.

From the graph:
1. The curve starts at \( (-4, 1) \) and rises sharply, indicating a positive slope.
2. The curve reaches a maximum point near \( (-2.5, 6) \).
3. After the maximum, the curve begins to decline, passing through \( (-1, 3) \) and \( (0, 0) \), indicating a negative slope.
4. The curve then rises again, becoming steeper as it moves to the right.

#### Step 2: Identify Critical Points
Critical points occur where the slope of the tangent is zero (i.e., the derivative is zero). These points divide the intervals of increase and decrease.
- From the graph, the critical points appear to be:
  - A local maximum near \( x = -2.5 \).
  - A local minimum near \( x = 1.5 \).

#### Step 3: Determine Intervals of Increase and Decrease
Using the critical points, we can divide the domain into intervals and determine the behavior of the function in each interval:
1. **Interval \( (-\infty, -2.5) \)**: The curve is rising, so the function is increasing.
2. **Interval \( (-2.5, 1.5) \)**: The curve is falling, so the function is decreasing.
3. **Interval \( (1.5, \infty) \)**: The curve is rising again, so the function is increasing.

#### Step 4: Verify with Given Points
- The point \( (-4, 1) \) is in the interval \( (-\infty, -2.5) \), where the function is increasing.
- The point \( (-1, 3) \) is in the interval \( (-2.5, 1.5) \), where the function is decreasing.
- The point \( (0, 0) \) is also in the interval \( (-2.5, 1.5) \), confirming the function is decreasing here.

#### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the function is:
- Increasing on \( (-\infty, -2.5) \cup (1.5, \infty) \).
- Decreasing on \( (-2.5, 1.5) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(-\infty, -2.5) \cup (1.5, \infty) \text{ (increasing)}, \quad (-2.5, 1.5) \text{ (decreasing)}}
\]
