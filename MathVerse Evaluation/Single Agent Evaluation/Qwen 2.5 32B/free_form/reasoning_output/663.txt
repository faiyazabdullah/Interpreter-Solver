### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a cylindrical shape with the following components:
- **Length (Height)**: \( L \)
- **Major Radius**: \( R \) (outer radius)
- **Minor Radius**: \( r \) (inner radius)

This is a hollow cylinder, meaning it has two concentric circular bases and a hollowed-out interior. The task is to find the **surface area** of this hollow cylinder.

### Surface Area Components of a Hollow Cylinder:
The total surface area of a hollow cylinder consists of:
1. **Outer curved surface area**: This is the lateral surface area of the outer cylinder.
2. **Inner curved surface area**: This is the lateral surface area of the inner cylinder.
3. **Two annular (ring-shaped) base areas**: These are the areas of the two circular rings formed by the difference between the outer and inner circles.

#### 1. Outer Curved Surface Area:
The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is \( 2\pi R L \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( L \) is the height. For the outer cylinder:
\[ \text{Outer curved surface area} = 2\pi R L \]

#### 2. Inner Curved Surface Area:
Similarly, for the inner cylinder:
\[ \text{Inner curved surface area} = 2\pi r L \]

#### 3. Annular Base Areas:
Each base is a ring (annulus) with an outer radius \( R \) and an inner radius \( r \). The area of one annular base is:
\[ \text{Area of one annular base} = \pi R^2 - \pi r^2 = \pi (R^2 - r^2) \]
Since there are two such bases, the total area of the two annular bases is:
\[ \text{Total annular base area} = 2\pi (R^2 - r^2) \]

### Total Surface Area:
The total surface area of the hollow cylinder is the sum of the outer curved surface area, the inner curved surface area, and the two annular base areas:
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 2\pi R L + 2\pi r L + 2\pi (R^2 - r^2) \]

### Factoring the Expression:
Factor out the common term \( 2\pi \):
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 2\pi (R L + r L + R^2 - r^2) \]

Notice that \( R^2 - r^2 \) can be factored further using the difference of squares:
\[ R^2 - r^2 = (R - r)(R + r) \]

Substitute this back into the expression:
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 2\pi (R L + r L + (R - r)(R + r)) \]

### Final Answer:
The fully factored expression for the surface area of the hollow cylinder is:
\[ \boxed{2\pi (R L + r L + (R - r)(R + r))} \]
