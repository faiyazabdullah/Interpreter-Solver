QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function combind by straight lines going through (3, -2), (1, 0), and (0,1). Write an equation for the graphed function f.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of a piecewise linear function \( f(x) \) based on the given graph. The graph shows a combination of straight-line segments passing through specific points: 
- \( (3, -2) \),
- \( (1, 0) \),
- \( (0, 1) \).

The function is defined by different linear equations over different intervals of \( x \). We need to determine these equations for each segment.

---

### Step 1: Identify the Segments
From the graph, we observe three distinct linear segments:
1. **Segment 1**: From \( (-\infty, 1] \), which passes through the points \( (0, 1) \) and \( (1, 0) \).
2. **Segment 2**: From \( (1, 3] \), which passes through the points \( (1, 0) \) and \( (3, -2) \).
3. **Segment 3**: From \( (3, \infty) \), which passes through the point \( (3, -2) \) and extends upward.

---

### Step 2: Find the Equation for Each Segment

#### **Segment 1: From \( (-\infty, 1] \)**
This segment passes through the points \( (0, 1) \) and \( (1, 0) \).

- **Slope (\( m \))**:
  \[
  m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - 1}{1 - 0} = -1
  \]

- **Equation of the Line**:
  Using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with the point \( (0, 1) \):
  \[
  y - 1 = -1(x - 0) \implies y = -x + 1
  \]

Thus, for \( x \leq 1 \):
\[
f(x) = -x + 1
\]

#### **Segment 2: From \( (1, 3] \)**
This segment passes through the points \( (1, 0) \) and \( (3, -2) \).

- **Slope (\( m \))**:
  \[
  m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-2 - 0}{3 - 1} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1
  \]

- **Equation of the Line**:
  Using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with the point \( (1, 0) \):
  \[
  y - 0 = -1(x - 1) \implies y = -x + 1
  \]

Thus, for \( 1 < x \leq 3 \):
\[
f(x) = -x + 1
\]

#### **Segment 3: From \( (3, \infty) \)**
This segment passes through the points \( (3, -2) \) and appears to extend upward with a positive slope. However, the exact slope is not visible from the provided points. To determine the slope, we would need additional points. Since no further points are given, we assume the function continues linearly based on the visible trend.

- **Slope (\( m \))**:
  The slope appears to be positive, but without more points, we cannot determine it precisely. However, since the problem does not provide further details, we assume the segment is a continuation of the trend shown.

For simplicity, let us assume the slope is such that the line passes through \( (3, -2) \) and extends upwards. If additional points were provided, we could refine this part. For now, we focus on the first two segments.

---

### Step 3: Combine the Segments into a Piecewise Function
Based on the analysis above, the function \( f(x) \) can be written as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x + 1 & \text{if } x \leq 3 \\
\text{(to be determined for } x > 3\text{)}
\end{cases}
\]

Since the problem does not provide enough information for \( x > 3 \), we will focus on the first two segments.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x + 1 & \text{if } x \leq 3 \\
\text{(additional information needed for } x > 3\text{)}
\end{cases}}
\]

====================================================================================================
EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x + 1 & \text{if } x \leq 3 \\
\text{(additional information needed for } x > 3\text{)}
\end{cases}$
