QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the figure shown. The two marked edges have the same length. The top rectangular prism has sides length of 12cm, 1cm and 1cm. The bottom rectangular prism has sides length of 7cm, 4cm and 1cm.

### Problem Analysis:
The given figure consists of two rectangular prisms stacked vertically. The dimensions of each prism are provided:
1. **Top Rectangular Prism**: Dimensions are \(12 \, \text{cm} \times 1 \, \text{cm} \times 1 \, \text{cm}\).
2. **Bottom Rectangular Prism**: Dimensions are \(7 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} \times 1 \, \text{cm}\).

We need to calculate the total surface area of the combined figure. To do this, we will:
1. Calculate the surface area of each prism separately.
2. Account for the overlap between the two prisms (since they are stacked, the top face of the bottom prism and the bottom face of the top prism will not contribute to the total surface area).

---

### Step 1: Surface Area of the Top Rectangular Prism
The surface area \(A_{\text{top}}\) of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[
A_{\text{top}} = 2(l_1 w_1 + l_1 h_1 + w_1 h_1)
\]
where \(l_1 = 12 \, \text{cm}\), \(w_1 = 1 \, \text{cm}\), and \(h_1 = 1 \, \text{cm}\).

Substitute the values:
\[
A_{\text{top}} = 2(12 \cdot 1 + 12 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) = 2(12 + 12 + 1) = 2 \cdot 25 = 50 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 2: Surface Area of the Bottom Rectangular Prism
The surface area \(A_{\text{bottom}}\) of the bottom rectangular prism is given by:
\[
A_{\text{bottom}} = 2(l_2 w_2 + l_2 h_2 + w_2 h_2)
\]
where \(l_2 = 7 \, \text{cm}\), \(w_2 = 4 \, \text{cm}\), and \(h_2 = 1 \, \text{cm}\).

Substitute the values:
\[
A_{\text{bottom}} = 2(7 \cdot 4 + 7 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 1) = 2(28 + 7 + 4) = 2 \cdot 39 = 78 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Adjust for Overlapping Faces
When the two prisms are stacked, the top face of the bottom prism and the bottom face of the top prism overlap. These overlapping faces do not contribute to the total surface area.

- The top face of the bottom prism has an area of \(l_2 \cdot w_2 = 7 \cdot 4 = 28 \, \text{cm}^2\).
- The bottom face of the top prism has an area of \(l_1 \cdot w_1 = 12 \cdot 1 = 12 \, \text{cm}^2\).

Since these faces overlap, we subtract their areas from the total surface area. However, note that only one of these faces contributes to the overlap (the smaller area is subtracted once). Here, the smaller area is \(12 \, \text{cm}^2\).

---

### Step 4: Total Surface Area
The total surface area \(A_{\text{total}}\) is the sum of the surface areas of the two prisms minus the area of the overlapping faces:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{top}} + A_{\text{bottom}} - \text{Overlapping Area}
\]
\[
A_{\text{total}} = 50 + 78 - 12 = 116 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{116 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
