QUESTION:
As shown in the figure above, a triangle has an angle of 50Â° and two sides of 12m and 13.1m. Calculate the area of the following triangle.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the area of the triangle, let's follow the solution steps systematically.

---

### Step 1: Identify the given information
From the image and the problem statement:
- One angle of the triangle is \( 50^\circ \).
- Two sides of the triangle are \( 12 \, \text{m} \) and \( 13.1 \, \text{m} \).
- The side of \( 12 \, \text{m} \) and the side of \( 13.1 \, \text{m} \) form the angle of \( 50^\circ \).

We need to calculate the area of the triangle.

---

### Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a triangle
The area \( A \) of a triangle when two sides and the included angle are known can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2}ab \sin C
\]
where:
- \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the two sides,
- \( C \) is the included angle between the two sides.

Here:
- \( a = 12 \, \text{m} \),
- \( b = 13.1 \, \text{m} \),
- \( C = 50^\circ \).

---

### Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula
Substitute \( a = 12 \), \( b = 13.1 \), and \( C = 50^\circ \) into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 13.1 \cdot \sin 50^\circ
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate \( \sin 50^\circ \)
Using a calculator, we find:
\[
\sin 50^\circ \approx 0.766
\]

Now substitute \( \sin 50^\circ \approx 0.766 \) into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 12 \cdot 13.1 \cdot 0.766
\]

---

### Step 5: Perform the multiplication
First, calculate the product inside the formula:
\[
12 \cdot 13.1 = 157.2
\]
Next, multiply by \( 0.766 \):
\[
157.2 \cdot 0.766 \approx 121.0392
\]
Finally, multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \):
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 121.0392 = 60.5196
\]

---

### Step 6: Round the result to two decimal places
Rounding \( 60.5196 \) to two decimal places gives:
\[
A \approx 60.52
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{60.52}
\]
