QUESTION:
The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given graph shows a linear relationship between the cost of a phone call (in dollars) and the duration of the call (in minutes). The task is to determine the **average rate of change**, which corresponds to the slope of the line in the graph.

#### Step 1: Identify Key Points from the Graph
From the graph:
- When the call length is \(0\) minutes, the cost is \(0\) dollars.
- When the call length is \(10\) minutes, the cost is \(10\) dollars.
- When the call length is \(20\) minutes, the cost is \(20\) dollars.

We can use any two points on the line to calculate the slope. Let's choose the points \((0, 0)\) and \((20, 20)\).

#### Step 2: Formula for Average Rate of Change (Slope)
The average rate of change between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]

#### Step 3: Substitute the Coordinates
Using the points \((0, 0)\) and \((20, 20)\):
\[
(x_1, y_1) = (0, 0), \quad (x_2, y_2) = (20, 20)
\]
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{20 - 0}{20 - 0} = \frac{20}{20} = 1
\]

#### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The average rate of change is \(1\), which means the cost increases by \$1 for every additional minute of call duration. This is consistent with the linear nature of the graph.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
