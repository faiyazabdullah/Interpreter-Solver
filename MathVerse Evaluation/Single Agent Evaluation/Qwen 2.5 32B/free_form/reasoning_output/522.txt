QUESTION:
This is the graph of $y=\sqrt{6 x+7}$, which goes through (-1,1), (3,5), (5,6), (7,7). Use the graph to find an approximate solution to $\sqrt{6 x+7}=6$. Round your answer to the nearest integer.

### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves finding an approximate solution to the equation \( \sqrt{6x + 7} = 6 \) using the provided graph of \( y = \sqrt{6x + 7} \). The graph shows several points that lie on the curve, including \((-1, 1)\), \((3, 5)\), \((5, 6)\), and \((7, 7)\).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to solve \( \sqrt{6x + 7} = 6 \). This means we are looking for the value of \( x \) such that the \( y \)-value on the graph is 6. From the graph, we can see that the point \((5, 6)\) lies on the curve, which satisfies \( y = 6 \).

#### Step 2: Verify the Point
The point \((5, 6)\) is already given on the graph. To confirm, substitute \( x = 5 \) into the equation \( y = \sqrt{6x + 7} \):
\[
y = \sqrt{6(5) + 7} = \sqrt{30 + 7} = \sqrt{37}
\]
Since \( \sqrt{37} \approx 6.08 \), the point \((5, 6)\) is very close to satisfying the equation \( y = 6 \). Therefore, \( x = 5 \) is a good approximation.

#### Step 3: Approximate Solution
The graph shows that when \( y = 6 \), the corresponding \( x \)-value is approximately 5. Since the problem asks for the solution rounded to the nearest integer, we conclude that the solution is \( x = 5 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
