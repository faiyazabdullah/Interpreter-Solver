QUESTION:
Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

If the graph is translated 10 units up, what will be the coordinates of the new $y$-intercept?

State the coordinates in the form $(a, b)$.

### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a linear function \( y = 4 - x \), which is already graphed. The task is to determine the new coordinates of the \( y \)-intercept after translating the graph 10 units upward.

#### Step 1: Understand the Original Function
The original function is:
\[ y = 4 - x \]

From the equation:
- The slope is \(-1\) (since the coefficient of \( x \) is \(-1\)).
- The \( y \)-intercept is \((0, 4)\) because when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 4 \).
- The \( x \)-intercept is \((4, 0)\) because when \( y = 0 \), \( 4 - x = 0 \implies x = 4 \).

#### Step 2: Translate the Graph 10 Units Upward
Translating a graph vertically means adding a constant to the \( y \)-coordinate of every point on the graph. If we translate the graph of \( y = 4 - x \) upward by 10 units, the new equation becomes:
\[ y = (4 - x) + 10 \]
\[ y = 14 - x \]

#### Step 3: Determine the New \( y \)-Intercept
The \( y \)-intercept occurs where \( x = 0 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the new equation:
\[ y = 14 - 0 \]
\[ y = 14 \]

Thus, the new \( y \)-intercept is \((0, 14)\).

#### Step 4: State the Final Answer
The coordinates of the new \( y \)-intercept are \((0, 14)\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(0, 14)}
\]
