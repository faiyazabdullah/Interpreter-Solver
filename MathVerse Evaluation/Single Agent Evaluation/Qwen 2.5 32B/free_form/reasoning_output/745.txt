QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the longest straw that can fit inside the cylindrical soft drink can. The straw will extend from the bottom of the can to the top, forming the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are the height of the cylinder and the diameter of its base.

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Height of the cylinder (\( h \)): \( 13 \) cm
- Radius of the cylinder (\( r \)): \( 3 \) cm
- Diameter of the cylinder (\( d \)): \( 2r = 2 \times 3 = 6 \) cm

### Step 2: Visualize the geometry
The longest straw that can fit inside the cylinder will extend from the bottom center of the circular base to the top edge of the cylinder, forming the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The legs of this right triangle are:
1. The height of the cylinder (\( h = 13 \) cm).
2. The diameter of the circular base (\( d = 6 \) cm).

### Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem
The length of the straw (\( L \)) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
L = \sqrt{h^2 + d^2}
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
L = \sqrt{13^2 + 6^2}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculations
First, calculate the squares of the legs:
\[
13^2 = 169
\]
\[
6^2 = 36
\]
Add these values:
\[
169 + 36 = 205
\]
Take the square root:
\[
L = \sqrt{205}
\]

### Step 5: Approximate and round down
Using a calculator:
\[
\sqrt{205} \approx 14.3178
\]
Since the question asks for the length rounded down to the nearest whole number to ensure the straw fits entirely inside the can:
\[
L \approx 14 \text{ cm}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
