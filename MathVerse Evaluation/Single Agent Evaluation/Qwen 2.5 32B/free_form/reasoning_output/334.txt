QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the positive direction of the x-axis is 28Â°.

Find the true bearing of A from O.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves determining the true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( O \). The key information provided is:
- The angle between line \( OA \) and the positive direction of the x-axis is \( 28^\circ \).
- The orientation of the coordinate system is standard, with the positive x-axis pointing right and the positive y-axis pointing up.

#### Step 1: Understanding True Bearing
True bearing is measured clockwise from the North direction (positive y-axis). To find the true bearing of \( A \) from \( O \):
1. Identify the angle between the positive y-axis (North direction) and the line \( OA \).
2. Convert this angle into a true bearing, which is always expressed as a value between \( 0^\circ \) and \( 360^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Relating Angles
- The angle between the positive x-axis and \( OA \) is given as \( 28^\circ \).
- Since the positive y-axis (North direction) is perpendicular to the positive x-axis, the angle between the positive y-axis and the positive x-axis is \( 90^\circ \).
- Therefore, the angle between the positive y-axis and \( OA \) can be calculated as:
  \[
  90^\circ + 28^\circ = 118^\circ
  \]
  This is because \( OA \) is below the positive x-axis, making it \( 118^\circ \) clockwise from the positive y-axis.

#### Step 3: Converting to True Bearing
The true bearing is simply the angle measured clockwise from the North direction. Since we have determined that the angle between the positive y-axis and \( OA \) is \( 118^\circ \), the true bearing of \( A \) from \( O \) is \( 118^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{118^\circ}
\]
