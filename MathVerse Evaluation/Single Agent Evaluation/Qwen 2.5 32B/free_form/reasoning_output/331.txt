QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, A and N where N denotes the north cardinal point. Angle PAN is 45Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from A.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( P \) from point \( A \). The given information includes:
- Point \( N \) represents the north cardinal direction.
- The angle \( \angle PAN = 45^\circ \).
- The red shaded region indicates part of a circular sector, but it is not directly relevant to the bearing calculation.

#### Step 1: Understanding True Bearing
True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction. In this context:
- The north direction is represented by the vertical line through point \( N \).
- The angle \( \angle PAN = 45^\circ \) is the angle between the line \( AN \) (north direction) and the line \( AP \).

#### Step 2: Determine the True Bearing
Since \( N \) is the north direction, the angle \( \angle PAN = 45^\circ \) means that the line \( AP \) is oriented at \( 45^\circ \) clockwise from the north direction. Therefore, the true bearing of \( P \) from \( A \) is simply \( 45^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Final Answer
The true bearing of \( P \) from \( A \) is \( 45^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{45^\circ}
\]
