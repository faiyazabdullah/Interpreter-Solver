QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the rectangular prism is 10cm. The base of the rectangular prism is a square with length of side of 13cm. Calculate the volume of the rectangular prism in the figure.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Examine the Geometric Figure and Identify Given Information:
- The figure is a **rectangular prism**.
- The base of the prism is a **square** with a side length of \(13 \, \text{cm}\).
- The height of the prism is given as \(10 \, \text{cm}\).

#### 2. Understand Measurements and Relationships:
- The base is a square, so all sides of the base are equal (\(13 \, \text{cm}\)).
- The height of the prism is perpendicular to the base and is given as \(10 \, \text{cm}\).

#### 3. Identify What Needs to Be Found:
- We need to calculate the **volume** of the rectangular prism.

#### 4. Apply Relevant Formulas:
The formula for the volume \(V\) of a rectangular prism is:
\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
\]
- The **base area** of the rectangular prism is the area of the square base:
\[
\text{Base Area} = \text{side length} \times \text{side length} = 13 \, \text{cm} \times 13 \, \text{cm} = 169 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
- The **height** of the prism is given as \(10 \, \text{cm}\).

Substitute these values into the volume formula:
\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height} = 169 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1690 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### 5. Show Calculations Clearly:
\[
\text{Base Area} = 13 \times 13 = 169 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
\[
V = 169 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 10 \, \text{cm} = 1690 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1690 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
