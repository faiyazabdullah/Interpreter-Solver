QUESTION:
Two flag posts of height 13 m and 18 m are erected 21 m apart. Find l, the length of the string (in metres) needed to join the tops of the two posts, correct to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the length of a string that connects the tops of two flag posts. The heights of the posts are given as 13 m and 18 m, and the horizontal distance between their bases is 21 m. This forms a right triangle, where:
- One leg of the triangle is the horizontal distance between the posts (21 m).
- The other leg is the vertical difference in height between the tops of the posts.
- The hypotenuse is the length of the string we need to find.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Height of the first post: \( h_1 = 13 \) m
- Height of the second post: \( h_2 = 18 \) m
- Horizontal distance between the posts: \( d = 21 \) m

#### Step 2: Determine the vertical difference in height
The vertical difference between the tops of the two posts is:
\[
h_2 - h_1 = 18 - 13 = 5 \text{ m}
\]

#### Step 3: Visualize the right triangle
The right triangle has:
- One leg of length 21 m (horizontal distance).
- Another leg of length 5 m (vertical difference).
- The hypotenuse is the length of the string \( l \).

#### Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem
The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
l^2 = d^2 + (h_2 - h_1)^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
l^2 = 21^2 + 5^2
\]
\[
l^2 = 441 + 25
\]
\[
l^2 = 466
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for \( l \)
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
l = \sqrt{466}
\]

#### Step 6: Calculate the value of \( l \)
Using a calculator:
\[
l \approx 21.6 \text{ m}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{21.6}
\]
