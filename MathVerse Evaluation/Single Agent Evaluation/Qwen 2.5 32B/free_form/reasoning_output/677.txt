### Problem Analysis:
The given geometric figure is a square prism with dimensions:
- Square base side lengths: \(3 \, \text{cm}\)
- Height: \(14 \, \text{cm}\)

We are tasked with finding the angle \(\theta\) formed by the diagonal \(DF\) of the prism and the horizontal plane \(FGH\). The angle \(\theta\) is denoted as \(\angle DFH\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Key Points and Dimensions**
- The square base \(ABCD\) has side lengths \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
- The height of the prism is \(14 \, \text{cm}\), which means the vertical distance from the base \(ABCD\) to the top face \(EFGH\) is \(14 \, \text{cm}\).
- The point \(F\) is directly below \(D\) on the bottom face \(EFGH\), and the point \(H\) is one of the vertices of the bottom face.

#### **Step 2: Determine Coordinates of Key Points**
To simplify calculations, we place the prism in a coordinate system:
- Let \(H = (0, 0, 0)\).
- Since \(HG = 14 \, \text{cm}\), the point \(G = (14, 0, 0)\).
- Since \(HE = 3 \, \text{cm}\), the point \(E = (0, 3, 0)\).
- The point \(F\) is directly above \(H\) at a height of \(3 \, \text{cm}\), so \(F = (0, 0, 3)\).
- The point \(D\) is directly above \(H\) at a height of \(14 \, \text{cm}\), so \(D = (0, 0, 14)\).

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Length of \(DF\)** 
The diagonal \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs along the vertical direction and the horizontal direction (from \(H\) to \(F\)).

- The vertical distance from \(D\) to \(F\) is the difference in their \(z\)-coordinates: \(14 - 3 = 11 \, \text{cm}\).
- The horizontal distance from \(H\) to \(F\) is the distance along the \(y\)-axis: \(3 \, \text{cm}\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle \(DFH\):
\[
DF = \sqrt{(11)^2 + (3)^2} = \sqrt{121 + 9} = \sqrt{130}
\]

#### **Step 4: Use Trigonometry to Find \(\theta\)** 
The angle \(\theta\) is the angle between the diagonal \(DF\) and the horizontal plane \(FGH\). In the right triangle \(DFH\):
- The vertical leg (opposite \(\theta\)) is the height difference \(11 \, \text{cm}\).
- The hypotenuse is \(DF = \sqrt{130}\).

Using the sine function:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{130}}
\]

To find \(\theta\), take the inverse sine:
\[
\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{11}{\sqrt{130}}\right)
\]

#### **Step 5: Compute the Value of \(\theta\)** 
First, calculate the numerical value of \(\frac{11}{\sqrt{130}}\):
\[
\sqrt{130} \approx 11.4018
\]
\[
\frac{11}{\sqrt{130}} \approx \frac{11}{11.4018} \approx 0.9648
\]

Now, compute \(\theta\):
\[
\theta = \arcsin(0.9648) \approx 74.68^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{74.68^\circ}
\]
