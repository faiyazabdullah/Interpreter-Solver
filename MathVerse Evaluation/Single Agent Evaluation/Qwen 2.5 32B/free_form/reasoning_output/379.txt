QUESTION:
A right trapezoid, with one of its base angles measuring 30^\circ, has an adjacent leg length of 8 to this angle. The length of the shorter base of the trapezoid is 4. Find t.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length \( t \) of the longer base of a right trapezoid. The trapezoid has the following properties:
- One of its base angles is \( 30^\circ \).
- The adjacent leg to this angle has a length of 8.
- The shorter base of the trapezoid is 4.
- The trapezoid is right, meaning it has at least one pair of perpendicular sides.

From the diagram, we can see that the trapezoid is divided into a rectangle and a right triangle. The goal is to determine the total length \( t \) of the longer base.

---

### Step 1: Identify Given Information
1. Shorter base of the trapezoid: \( 4 \).
2. Adjacent leg to the \( 30^\circ \) angle: \( 8 \).
3. One base angle is \( 30^\circ \).
4. The trapezoid is right, so one of its legs is perpendicular to the bases.

From the diagram, the right triangle formed by the height, the adjacent leg (8), and part of the longer base can be analyzed using trigonometric relationships.

---

### Step 2: Use Trigonometry to Find the Height \( m \)
In the right triangle:
- The adjacent leg to the \( 30^\circ \) angle is 8.
- The height \( m \) of the trapezoid is the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

Using the sine function:
\[
\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{m}{8}
\]
Since \( \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{m}{8} \implies m = 8 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 4
\]
Thus, the height \( m \) of the trapezoid is \( 4 \).

---

### Step 3: Use Trigonometry to Find the Horizontal Extension
In the same right triangle:
- The adjacent leg to the \( 30^\circ \) angle is 8.
- The horizontal extension (part of the longer base beyond the shorter base) is the side adjacent to the \( 30^\circ \) angle.

Using the cosine function:
\[
\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\text{horizontal extension}}{8}
\]
Since \( \cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\text{horizontal extension}}{8} \implies \text{horizontal extension} = 8 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 4\sqrt{3}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Length \( t \) of the Longer Base
The total length \( t \) of the longer base is the sum of:
1. The shorter base (4).
2. The horizontal extension from the right triangle (\( 4\sqrt{3} \)).

Thus:
\[
t = 4 + 4\sqrt{3}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4 + 4\sqrt{3}}
\]
