QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function going through (-3, -4), (-1, 0), (0, 2), and (1, 4). Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Analysis of the Problem

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a piecewise linear function plotted on a coordinate plane. The function passes through the following points:
- \( (-3, -4) \)
- \( (-1, 0) \)
- \( (0, 2) \)
- \( (1, 4) \)

The graph consists of straight-line segments connecting these points. We need to determine the intervals on which the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.

#### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
From the graph:
1. Between \( x = -3 \) and \( x = -1 \), the function is a straight line segment connecting \( (-3, -4) \) and \( (-1, 0) \).
2. Between \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 0 \), the function is a straight line segment connecting \( (-1, 0) \) and \( (0, 2) \).
3. Between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), the function is a straight line segment connecting \( (0, 2) \) and \( (1, 4) \).
4. For \( x \geq 1 \), the function is a horizontal line at \( y = 4 \).

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine the intervals where the function is:
- Increasing: The slope is positive.
- Decreasing: The slope is negative.
- Constant: The slope is zero.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties and Formulas
To analyze the behavior of the function, we calculate the slope of each segment:
1. **Segment from \( (-3, -4) \) to \( (-1, 0) \):**
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - (-4)}{-1 - (-3)} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]
   Since the slope is positive, the function is increasing on \( (-3, -1) \).

2. **Segment from \( (-1, 0) \) to \( (0, 2) \):**
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-1)} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
   \]
   Since the slope is positive, the function is increasing on \( (-1, 0) \).

3. **Segment from \( (0, 2) \) to \( (1, 4) \):**
   \[
   \text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{4 - 2}{1 - 0} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
   \]
   Since the slope is positive, the function is increasing on \( (0, 1) \).

4. **Segment for \( x \geq 1 \):**
   The function is a horizontal line at \( y = 4 \). The slope is zero, so the function is constant on \( [1, \infty) \).

#### Step 5: Combine Results
- The function is increasing on the intervals \( (-3, -1) \), \( (-1, 0) \), and \( (0, 1) \).
- The function is constant on the interval \( [1, \infty) \).
- There are no intervals where the function is decreasing.

### Final Answer
\[
\boxed{\text{Increasing on } (-3, 1), \text{ Constant on } [1, \infty)}
\]
