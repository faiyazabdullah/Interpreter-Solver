QUESTION:
A suspension bridge is being built. The top of the concrete tower is 35.5 metres above the bridge and the connection point for the main cable is 65.9 metres from the tower.

Assume that the concrete tower and the bridge are perpendicular to each other.

If the length of the cable is h metres, find h to two decimal places.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Figure and Given Information**
The problem describes a suspension bridge setup where:
- The height of the concrete tower above the bridge is \(35.5\) meters.
- The horizontal distance from the base of the tower to the connection point of the cable on the bridge is \(65.9\) meters.
- The concrete tower and the bridge are perpendicular to each other, forming a right triangle.
- We need to find the length of the cable, denoted as \(h\) meters.

#### **Step 2: Identify the Geometric Relationships**
The situation forms a right triangle:
- One leg of the triangle is the vertical height of the tower, which is \(35.5\) meters.
- The other leg is the horizontal distance from the base of the tower to the connection point of the cable, which is \(65.9\) meters.
- The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the length of the cable, which we need to find.

#### **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]
where:
- \(c\) is the hypotenuse (length of the cable),
- \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of the right triangle.

Here:
- \(a = 35.5\) meters (vertical height),
- \(b = 65.9\) meters (horizontal distance).

Substitute these values into the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
h^2 = 35.5^2 + 65.9^2
\]

#### **Step 4: Perform the Calculations**
First, calculate \(35.5^2\):
\[
35.5^2 = 35.5 \times 35.5 = 1260.25
\]

Next, calculate \(65.9^2\):
\[
65.9^2 = 65.9 \times 65.9 = 4342.81
\]

Add these two results:
\[
h^2 = 1260.25 + 4342.81 = 5603.06
\]

Now, solve for \(h\) by taking the square root of both sides:
\[
h = \sqrt{5603.06}
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
h \approx 74.85
\]

#### **Step 5: Round to Two Decimal Places**
The length of the cable is approximately \(74.85\) meters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{74.85}
\]
