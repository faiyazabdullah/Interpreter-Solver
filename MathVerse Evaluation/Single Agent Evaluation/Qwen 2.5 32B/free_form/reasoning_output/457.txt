QUESTION:
Consider the circle on the graph. Its center is at (1,3) and its radius is 6.

Find the equation of the circle in standard form.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given geometric figure shows a circle centered at \((1, 3)\) with a radius of \(6\). The task is to find the equation of the circle in standard form.

#### Step 1: Recall the Standard Form of a Circle's Equation
The standard form of the equation of a circle with center \((h, k)\) and radius \(r\) is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]

#### Step 2: Identify the Given Information
From the problem statement:
- Center of the circle: \((h, k) = (1, 3)\)
- Radius of the circle: \(r = 6\)

#### Step 3: Substitute the Values into the Standard Form
Substitute \(h = 1\), \(k = 3\), and \(r = 6\) into the standard form equation:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 6^2
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
Calculate \(6^2\):
\[
6^2 = 36
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Equation
The equation \((x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36\) correctly represents a circle centered at \((1, 3)\) with a radius of \(6\), as it satisfies the standard form requirements.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36}
\]

====================================================================================================
EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36$
