QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.
Find the radius of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure**
The image shows a circle on a coordinate plane. The circle intersects the axes at four points, but the exact coordinates of these intersections are not explicitly labeled. However, we can infer some key details from the figure:
- The center of the circle appears to be near the point \((-2, -3)\).
- The circle intersects the axes symmetrically around its center.

#### **Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships**
To find the radius of the circle, we need to determine the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference. Since the circle intersects the axes, we can use the coordinates of these intersection points relative to the center.

#### **Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
We need to find the radius \( r \) of the circle. The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on its circumference.

#### **Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Formulas**
The general equation of a circle is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]
where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

From the figure, the center of the circle appears to be approximately \((-2, -3)\). To confirm the radius, we need to determine the distance from the center to one of the intersection points on the axes.

#### **Step 5: Determine the Center and Radius**
From the figure:
- The center of the circle is \((-2, -3)\).
- The circle intersects the axes at points that are equidistant from the center. By visually inspecting the graph, we can estimate the radius.

The circle intersects the \( x \)-axis at approximately \((-5, 0)\) and \((1, 0)\), and the \( y \)-axis at approximately \((0, -6)\) and \((0, 0)\).

Let's calculate the radius using the distance formula:
\[
\text{Distance formula: } d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Choose the point \((-5, 0)\) (intersection with the \( x \)-axis):
\[
r = \sqrt{(-5 - (-2))^2 + (0 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{(-5 + 2)^2 + (0 + 3)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]

#### **Step 6: Verify the Calculation**
We can verify this radius by checking the distance from the center \((-2, -3)\) to another intersection point, such as \((1, 0)\):
\[
r = \sqrt{(1 - (-2))^2 + (0 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{(1 + 2)^2 + (0 + 3)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]

The calculations confirm that the radius is consistent.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{3\sqrt{2}}
\]
