### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a triangular prism. The key details are:
- \( AB = 10 \)
- \( CF = 4 \)
- \( EF = 15 \)
- \( EX = XF \), meaning \( X \) is the midpoint of \( EF \).

We need to find the length of \( CX \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
1. **Base of the Prism**:
   - The base of the prism is the rectangle \( ABCD \).
   - \( AB = 10 \) and \( BC = 4 \).

2. **Top of the Prism**:
   - The top of the prism is the rectangle \( EFGH \).
   - \( EF = 15 \) and \( FG = 4 \) (since \( FG \parallel BC \)).

3. **Vertical Edges**:
   - The vertical edges (e.g., \( AE \), \( BF \), \( CG \), \( DH \)) connect corresponding vertices of the base and top rectangles. These edges are perpendicular to both the base and the top.

4. **Point \( X \)**:
   - \( X \) is the midpoint of \( EF \). Therefore, \( EX = XF = \frac{EF}{2} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \).

#### Step 2: Coordinate System Setup
To simplify the problem, we place the prism in a coordinate system:
- Let \( A = (0, 0, 0) \), \( B = (10, 0, 0) \), \( C = (10, 4, 0) \), and \( D = (0, 4, 0) \).
- The top rectangle \( EFGH \) is directly above the base rectangle, so:
  - \( E = (0, 0, h) \), \( F = (15, 0, h) \), \( G = (15, 4, h) \), \( H = (0, 4, h) \).

Since the height \( h \) of the prism is not explicitly given, it does not affect the calculation of \( CX \) because \( C \) and \( X \) lie in the same plane parallel to the base.

#### Step 3: Coordinates of Key Points
- \( C = (10, 4, 0) \)
- \( X \) is the midpoint of \( EF \):
  - \( E = (0, 0, h) \)
  - \( F = (15, 0, h) \)
  - Midpoint \( X = \left( \frac{0 + 15}{2}, \frac{0 + 0}{2}, \frac{h + h}{2} \right) = \left( 7.5, 0, h \right) \).

#### Step 4: Distance Formula
The distance \( CX \) can be calculated using the Euclidean distance formula:
\[
CX = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]
Here:
- \( C = (10, 4, 0) \)
- \( X = (7.5, 0, h) \)

Substitute the coordinates:
\[
CX = \sqrt{(7.5 - 10)^2 + (0 - 4)^2 + (h - 0)^2}
\]
\[
CX = \sqrt{(-2.5)^2 + (-4)^2 + h^2}
\]
\[
CX = \sqrt{6.25 + 16 + h^2}
\]
\[
CX = \sqrt{22.25 + h^2}
\]

#### Step 5: Simplify and Approximate
Since the height \( h \) is not specified and does not affect the horizontal and vertical distances in the plane, we assume \( h = 0 \) for simplicity (as the problem does not provide \( h \) and focuses on the projection in the plane):
\[
CX = \sqrt{22.25 + 0^2} = \sqrt{22.25} \approx 4.72
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4.72}
\]
