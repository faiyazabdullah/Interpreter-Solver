QUESTION:
We want to find the surface area of this shape. Assume that both boxes are identical in size. The box has sides of length 25, 20 and 33. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The given figure consists of two identical rectangular prisms and a cylindrical section connecting them. To find the total surface area of the solid, we need to calculate the surface area of each component while accounting for overlaps and exposed surfaces.

#### Given Dimensions:
1. **Rectangular Prisms**:
   - Dimensions: \(25 \times 20 \times 33\)
   - There are two identical prisms.

2. **Cylinder**:
   - Radius: \(6\)
   - Height: \(11\)

#### Key Observations:
- The cylinder connects the two prisms along their faces.
- The cylinder's circular bases are embedded within the faces of the prisms, so their areas are not part of the external surface area.
- We need to account for the surface area of the prisms and the lateral surface area of the cylinder, subtracting any overlapping areas.

### Step 1: Surface Area of One Rectangular Prism
The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area of one prism} = 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]
where \(l = 25\), \(w = 20\), and \(h = 33\).

\[
\text{Surface Area of one prism} = 2(25 \cdot 20 + 25 \cdot 33 + 20 \cdot 33)
\]
\[
= 2(500 + 825 + 660)
\]
\[
= 2 \cdot 1985 = 3970
\]

Since there are two identical prisms, the total surface area of the two prisms is:
\[
2 \cdot 3970 = 7940
\]

However, we need to adjust for the overlap caused by the cylinder.

---

### Step 2: Overlapping Areas Due to the Cylinder
The cylinder is embedded in the faces of the prisms, so its circular bases are not part of the external surface area. However, the cylinder reduces the surface area of the prisms where it is embedded.

#### Area of Each Circular Base of the Cylinder:
The area of one circular base is:
\[
\text{Area of one circular base} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 6^2 = 36\pi
\]

Since the cylinder is embedded in two faces of the prisms (one face on each prism), the total area removed from the prisms is:
\[
2 \cdot 36\pi = 72\pi
\]

---

### Step 3: Lateral Surface Area of the Cylinder
The lateral surface area of the cylinder is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
\]
where \(r = 6\) and \(h = 11\).

\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 11 = 132\pi
\]

---

### Step 4: Total Surface Area of the Solid
The total surface area of the solid is the sum of the surface areas of the two prisms minus the areas of the circular bases (since they are internal) plus the lateral surface area of the cylinder.

\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Surface Area of two prisms} - \text{Area of circular bases} + \text{Lateral Surface Area of cylinder}
\]
\[
= 7940 - 72\pi + 132\pi
\]
\[
= 7940 + 60\pi
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
60\pi \approx 60 \cdot 3.14159 = 188.4954
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 7940 + 188.4954 = 8128.4954
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 8128.50
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8128.50}
\]
