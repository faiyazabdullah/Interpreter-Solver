QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Image:
The image shows two functions:
1. **Function \( f(x) \)** in blue, which is identified as \( y = x^2 \). This is a standard parabola opening upwards, with its vertex at the origin \((0, 0)\).
2. **Function \( g(x) \)** in red, which appears to be a translated version of \( f(x) \). The red curve is shifted both horizontally and vertically from the blue curve.

#### Step 1: Examine the Translation
- The vertex of the blue parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \) is at \((0, 0)\).
- The vertex of the red parabola \( g(x) \) is at \((-2, -1)\), as observed from the graph:
  - Horizontally, the red parabola is shifted 2 units to the left.
  - Vertically, the red parabola is shifted 1 unit downward.

#### Step 2: General Form of a Translated Parabola
The general form of a parabola that is a translation of \( y = x^2 \) is:
\[
g(x) = (x - h)^2 + k
\]
where:
- \( (h, k) \) is the vertex of the translated parabola.

#### Step 3: Identify the Vertex of \( g(x) \)
From the graph, the vertex of \( g(x) \) is \((-2, -1)\). Therefore:
- \( h = -2 \)
- \( k = -1 \)

#### Step 4: Substitute the Values into the General Form
Substituting \( h = -2 \) and \( k = -1 \) into the general form \( g(x) = (x - h)^2 + k \):
\[
g(x) = (x - (-2))^2 + (-1)
\]
Simplify:
\[
g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 1
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Equation
The equation \( g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 1 \) matches the translation observed in the graph:
- Shifting \( y = x^2 \) 2 units to the left results in \( y = (x + 2)^2 \).
- Shifting this result 1 unit downward results in \( y = (x + 2)^2 - 1 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 1}
\]
