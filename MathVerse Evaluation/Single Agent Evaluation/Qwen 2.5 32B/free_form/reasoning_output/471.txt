FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of a semicircle that passes through the points \((-7, 0)\), \((-5, 5)\), \((0, 7)\), \((5, 5)\), and \((7, 0)\). The semicircle is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis, as indicated by the symmetry of the given points.

#### Step 1: Identify Key Properties
1. **Symmetry**: The semicircle is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis. This implies the center of the full circle lies on the \(y\)-axis.
2. **Points on the Semicircle**: The points \((-7, 0)\), \((0, 7)\), and \((7, 0)\) lie on the semicircle.
3. **Diameter**: The points \((-7, 0)\) and \((7, 0)\) suggest that the diameter of the full circle lies along the \(x\)-axis, with endpoints at \((-7, 0)\) and \((7, 0)\).

#### Step 2: Determine the Center and Radius
- The center of the full circle lies on the \(y\)-axis, so its coordinates are \((0, k)\).
- The radius \(r\) is half the distance between \((-7, 0)\) and \((7, 0)\):
  \[
  r = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{distance between } (-7, 0) \text{ and } (7, 0) = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7.
  \]
- Therefore, the center of the full circle is \((0, k)\) and the radius is \(7\).

#### Step 3: Use a Point to Find \(k\)
The point \((0, 7)\) lies on the semicircle. Substituting \((0, 7)\) into the general equation of a circle \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k) = (0, k)\) and \(r = 7\):
\[
(0 - 0)^2 + (7 - k)^2 = 7^2.
\]
Simplify:
\[
(7 - k)^2 = 49.
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
7 - k = \pm 7.
\]
This gives two solutions:
\[
7 - k = 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 0,
\]
\[
7 - k = -7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 14.
\]
Since the semicircle is above the \(x\)-axis, we choose \(k = 7\). Thus, the center of the full circle is \((0, 7)\).

#### Step 4: Write the Equation of the Full Circle
The equation of the full circle with center \((0, 7)\) and radius \(7\) is:
\[
x^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 49.
\]

#### Step 5: Restrict to the Semicircle
The semicircle is the upper half of the full circle, so we restrict \(y\) to be greater than or equal to the \(x\)-axis. The equation of the semicircle is:
\[
x^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 49, \quad y \geq 7.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{x^2 + (y - 7)^2 = 49, \quad y \geq 7}
\]
