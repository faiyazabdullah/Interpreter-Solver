QUESTION:
A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm. We wish to find the surface area of the entire solid. Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object.
What is the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism? Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the **exposed surface area** of a rectangular prism that is attached to a cylinder. The total surface area of the rectangular prism includes all six faces, but since part of it is covered by the cylinder, we need to subtract the area of the face where the cylinder is attached.

#### Given Information:
1. **Cylinder**:
   - Radius \( r = 5 \) mm
   - Height \( h = 11 \) mm

2. **Rectangular Prism**:
   - Dimensions: \( 65 \) mm × \( 21 \) mm × \( 10 \) mm
   - One face of the prism (with dimensions \( 21 \) mm × \( 10 \) mm) is completely covered by the base of the cylinder.

#### Objective:
Find the **exposed surface area** of the rectangular prism.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism
The formula for the total surface area of a rectangular prism is:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
\]
where \( l \), \( w \), and \( h \) are the length, width, and height of the prism, respectively.

Here:
- \( l = 65 \) mm
- \( w = 21 \) mm
- \( h = 10 \) mm

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 2(65 \times 21) + 2(65 \times 10) + 2(21 \times 10)
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
2(65 \times 21) = 2(1365) = 2730 \quad \text{(top and bottom faces)}
\]
\[
2(65 \times 10) = 2(650) = 1300 \quad \text{(front and back faces)}
\]
\[
2(21 \times 10) = 2(210) = 420 \quad \text{(left and right faces)}
\]

Add these together:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 2730 + 1300 + 420 = 4450 \text{ mm}^2
\]

---

### Step 2: Subtract the Area of the Face Covered by the Cylinder
The cylinder is attached to one face of the rectangular prism, specifically the face with dimensions \( 21 \) mm × \( 10 \) mm. This face is completely covered, so its area must be subtracted from the total surface area.

The area of this face is:
\[
\text{Area of covered face} = 21 \times 10 = 210 \text{ mm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the Exposed Surface Area
The exposed surface area is the total surface area minus the area of the covered face:
\[
\text{Exposed Surface Area} = \text{Total Surface Area} - \text{Area of covered face}
\]
\[
\text{Exposed Surface Area} = 4450 - 210 = 4240 \text{ mm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4240}
\]
