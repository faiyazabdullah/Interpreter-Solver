QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of y=\sin x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(90^\circ ,1\right).

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves understanding the transformation applied to the sine function and determining the first maximum point of the transformed function \( y = 5 \sin x \).

#### Step 1: Analyze the Original Function \( y = \sin x \)
- The graph of \( y = \sin x \) is shown in the image.
- Key points on the graph:
  - \( (0, 0) \)
  - \( (90^\circ, 1) \)
  - \( (180^\circ, 0) \)
  - \( (270^\circ, -1) \)
  - \( (360^\circ, 0) \)
- The first maximum point of \( y = \sin x \) for \( x \geq 0 \) is at \( (90^\circ, 1) \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Transformation
The function \( y = 5 \sin x \) is a vertical stretch of the original sine function \( y = \sin x \) by a factor of 5. This means:
- The amplitude of the sine function is multiplied by 5.
- All \( y \)-values of the original function are scaled by 5.
- The shape of the sine wave remains the same, but the peaks and troughs are stretched vertically.

#### Step 3: Determine the First Maximum Point of \( y = 5 \sin x \)
- The first maximum point of \( y = \sin x \) occurs at \( (90^\circ, 1) \).
- When we apply the vertical stretch by a factor of 5, the \( y \)-coordinate of the maximum point is scaled by 5.
- Therefore, the \( y \)-coordinate of the maximum point becomes \( 1 \times 5 = 5 \).
- The \( x \)-coordinate remains unchanged because the transformation does not affect the horizontal position.

Thus, the first maximum point of \( y = 5 \sin x \) is at \( (90^\circ, 5) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(90^\circ, 5)}
\]
