QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The x-axis represents Time (minutes) and the y-axis represents Water (liters). The slope is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Archimedes drained the water in his tub.
The amount of water left in the tub (in liters) as a function of time (in minutes) is graphed.
How much water was initially in the tub?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a linear function that models the amount of water left in a tub as a function of time. The graph shows the relationship between the amount of water (in liters) and time (in minutes). Here are the key points from the graph and the problem statement:

- The x-axis represents **Time (minutes)**.
- The y-axis represents **Water (liters)**.
- The slope of the line is negative, indicating that the amount of water decreases over time.
- The line intersects the **y-axis** at the point \((0, 360)\), meaning that at \(t = 0\) minutes, the tub contains 360 liters of water.
- The line intersects the **x-axis** at the point \((5, 0)\), meaning that after 5 minutes, the tub is empty.

We are tasked with determining how much water was initially in the tub.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Interpret the y-intercept
The y-intercept of the graph is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. This occurs when \( t = 0 \). From the graph, we see that the y-intercept is \((0, 360)\). This means that at \( t = 0 \) minutes, the tub contains 360 liters of water.

#### Step 2: Understand the question
The question asks for the initial amount of water in the tub. The term "initial" refers to the amount of water present at the start, which corresponds to the y-intercept of the graph.

#### Step 3: Confirm the initial amount
From the graph and the y-intercept, it is clear that the initial amount of water in the tub is 360 liters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{360}
\]
