QUESTION:
The top of a solid cone was sawed off to form the solid attached. The top cone has a diameter of 8cm and slant height of 8cm. The solid cone has a diameter of 4cm. The solid left has a slant height of 8cm. Find the surface area of the solid formed, correct to two decimal places.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the surface area of a truncated cone (frustum) formed by cutting off the top of a larger cone. The given dimensions are as follows:
- Top diameter of the original cone: \(8 \, \text{cm}\) (so the radius \(r_1 = 4 \, \text{cm}\)).
- Slant height of the original cone: \(8 \, \text{cm}\).
- Diameter of the base of the frustum: \(4 \, \text{cm}\) (so the radius \(r_2 = 2 \, \text{cm}\)).
- Slant height of the frustum: \(8 \, \text{cm}\).

### Step 1: Understanding the Surface Area of a Frustum
The surface area of a frustum consists of three parts:
1. **Lateral surface area of the frustum**.
2. **Base area of the frustum** (the larger circular base).
3. **Top area of the frustum** (the smaller circular top).

However, since the problem specifies the frustum's slant height and the radii, we focus primarily on the lateral surface area and the areas of the circular bases.

#### Formula for Lateral Surface Area of a Frustum:
The lateral surface area \(A_{\text{lateral}}\) of a frustum is given by:
\[
A_{\text{lateral}} = \pi (r_1 + r_2) l
\]
where:
- \(r_1\) is the radius of the larger base,
- \(r_2\) is the radius of the smaller base,
- \(l\) is the slant height of the frustum.

#### Formula for Base Areas:
- The area of the larger base (\(A_{\text{base}}\)):
\[
A_{\text{base}} = \pi r_2^2
\]
- The area of the smaller top (\(A_{\text{top}}\)):
\[
A_{\text{top}} = \pi r_1^2
\]

### Step 2: Substitute Given Values
From the problem:
- \(r_1 = 4 \, \text{cm}\),
- \(r_2 = 2 \, \text{cm}\),
- \(l = 8 \, \text{cm}\).

#### Calculate the Lateral Surface Area:
\[
A_{\text{lateral}} = \pi (r_1 + r_2) l = \pi (4 + 2) \cdot 8 = \pi \cdot 6 \cdot 8 = 48\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Calculate the Base Area:
The base of the frustum is the larger circle with radius \(r_2 = 2 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
A_{\text{base}} = \pi r_2^2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Calculate the Top Area:
The top of the frustum is the smaller circle with radius \(r_1 = 4 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
A_{\text{top}} = \pi r_1^2 = \pi \cdot 4^2 = 16\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Total Surface Area
The total surface area \(A_{\text{total}}\) of the frustum includes the lateral surface area and the areas of both the base and the top:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{lateral}} + A_{\text{base}} + A_{\text{top}}
\]
Substitute the calculated values:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = 48\pi + 4\pi + 16\pi = 68\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):
\[
A_{\text{total}} = 68 \cdot 3.1416 \approx 213.63 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{213.63 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
