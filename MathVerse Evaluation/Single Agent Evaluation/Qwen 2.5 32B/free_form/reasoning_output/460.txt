### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves identifying the center of a circle from its graphical representation. The circle is shown on a Cartesian coordinate plane, and it intersects the axes at two points. We need to determine the coordinates of the circle's center based on the provided visual information.

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
- The circle is centered near the origin but is offset slightly.
- The circle intersects the \( x \)-axis at approximately \((-3, 0)\) and the \( y \)-axis at approximately \((0, -3)\).
- The center of the circle appears to be equidistant from these two intersection points, as the circle is symmetric about its center.

#### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
- The distance from the center of the circle to each intersection point is the radius of the circle.
- Since the circle intersects the \( x \)-axis at \((-3, 0)\) and the \( y \)-axis at \((0, -3)\), the center must lie along the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining these two points.
- The midpoint of the line segment joining \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, -3)\) is:
  \[
  \left( \frac{-3 + 0}{2}, \frac{0 + (-3)}{2} \right) = \left( -\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{3}{2} \right)
  \]
- The slope of the line segment joining \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, -3)\) is:
  \[
  \text{slope} = \frac{-3 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{-3}{3} = -1
  \]
- The perpendicular bisector of this line segment will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of \(-1\), which is \(1\). Thus, the equation of the perpendicular bisector passing through \(\left( -\frac{3}{2}, -\frac{3}{2} \right)\) is:
  \[
  y + \frac{3}{2} = 1 \left( x + \frac{3}{2} \right) \implies y = x
  \]
- Since the center of the circle lies on the line \( y = x \), the coordinates of the center must be of the form \((a, a)\).

#### Step 3: Determine the Exact Coordinates of the Center
- From the graph, the center appears to be located at \((-2, -2)\). This can be verified by checking the distances from the center to the intersection points:
  - Distance from \((-2, -2)\) to \((-3, 0)\):
    \[
    \sqrt{((-3) - (-2))^2 + (0 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5}
    \]
  - Distance from \((-2, -2)\) to \((0, -3)\):
    \[
    \sqrt{(0 - (-2))^2 + ((-3) - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
    \]
- Both distances are equal, confirming that \((-2, -2)\) is indeed the center of the circle.

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The center of the circle is \((-2, -2)\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(-2, -2)}\]
