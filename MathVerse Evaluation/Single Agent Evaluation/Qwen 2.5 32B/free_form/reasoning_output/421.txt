QUESTION:
The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a rectangular figure divided into two sections:
1. An orange section with dimensions labeled as \(6\) (height) and \(1000\) (width). The area of this orange section is explicitly stated as \(6000\).
2. A white section adjacent to the orange section, which does not have its dimensions labeled but contributes to the total area of the entire rectangle.

The total area of the entire rectangle is given as \(6096\).

#### Step 1: Understand the problem
We need to determine the area of the white section. This can be calculated by subtracting the area of the orange section from the total area of the rectangle.

#### Step 2: Identify known values
- Area of the orange section: \(6000\)
- Total area of the rectangle: \(6096\)

#### Step 3: Calculate the area of the white section
The area of the white section is the difference between the total area and the area of the orange section:
\[
\text{Area of the white section} = \text{Total area} - \text{Area of the orange section}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\text{Area of the white section} = 6096 - 6000
\]

#### Step 4: Perform the calculation
\[
\text{Area of the white section} = 96
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{96}
\]
