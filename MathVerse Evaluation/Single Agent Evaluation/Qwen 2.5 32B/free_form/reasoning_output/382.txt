QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one leg measuring 12, the hypotenuse measures 8\sqrt{3}. Solve for the unknown \theta . Leave your answer in degrees.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for the unknown angle \(\theta\) in the given right-angled triangle, let's follow the solution steps carefully.

---

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The triangle is a right-angled triangle.
- One leg of the triangle has a length of \(12\).
- The hypotenuse has a length of \(8\sqrt{3}\).
- We need to find the angle \(\theta\), which is opposite the side of length \(12\).

---

### Step 2: Understand the relationship between the sides and the angle
In a right-angled triangle, the trigonometric function that relates an angle to the opposite side and the hypotenuse is the sine function:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here:
- The side opposite to \(\theta\) is \(12\).
- The hypotenuse is \(8\sqrt{3}\).

Thus:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{12}{8\sqrt{3}}
\]

---

### Step 3: Simplify the expression for \(\sin(\theta)\)
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{12}{8\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}}
\]
To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{3}\):
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{3}{2\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

So:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

---

### Step 4: Determine the angle \(\theta\)
The value \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) corresponds to a well-known angle in trigonometry. From the unit circle or trigonometric tables:
\[
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta = 60^\circ
\]

---

### Step 5: Verify the solution
To ensure the solution is correct, we can check the Pythagorean theorem for the triangle. The other leg (adjacent to \(\theta\)) can be calculated using:
\[
\text{adjacent} = \sqrt{\text{hypotenuse}^2 - \text{opposite}^2}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\text{adjacent} = \sqrt{(8\sqrt{3})^2 - 12^2} = \sqrt{192 - 144} = \sqrt{48} = 4\sqrt{3}
\]
This confirms that the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
(4\sqrt{3})^2 + 12^2 = (8\sqrt{3})^2
\]
\[
48 + 144 = 192
\]
The calculation is consistent, so the solution is verified.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{60^\circ}
\]
