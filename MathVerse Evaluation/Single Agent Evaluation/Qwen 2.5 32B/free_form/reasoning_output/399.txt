QUESTION:
A figure with a radius of $ 5 \mathrm{~mm}$. Find the exact area of the given figure:

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's carefully analyze the given figure and apply the necessary geometric principles step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the given information**
- The figure consists of a quarter-circle (a sector of a circle with a central angle of \(90^\circ\)).
- The radius of the circle is given as \(5 \, \text{mm}\).

---

### **Step 2: Understand what needs to be found**
We are tasked with finding the **exact area** of the given figure, which is the quarter-circle.

---

### **Step 3: Recall the formula for the area of a sector**
The area \(A\) of a sector of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
\]
However, since the central angle is given in degrees (\(90^\circ\)), we can use the simplified formula for a sector with a known central angle:
\[
A = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi r^2
\]
For a quarter-circle, the central angle \(\theta = 90^\circ\), so:
\[
A = \frac{90^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2
\]

---

### **Step 4: Substitute the given radius**
The radius \(r\) is \(5 \, \text{mm}\). Substituting this into the formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \pi (5)^2
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{4} \pi \cdot 25
\]
\[
A = \frac{25}{4} \pi
\]

---

### **Step 5: Write the final answer**
The exact area of the quarter-circle is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{25}{4} \pi \text{ mm}^2}
\]
