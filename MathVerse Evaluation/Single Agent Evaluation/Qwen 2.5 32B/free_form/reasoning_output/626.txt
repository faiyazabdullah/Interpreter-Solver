QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The slope is less than 0. It passes through (0,4) and (4,0). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

State the coordinates of the $x$-intercept in the form $(a, b)$.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem asks us to determine the coordinates of the $x$-intercept of the linear function $y = 4 - x$. The $x$-intercept occurs where the graph crosses the $x$-axis, which happens when $y = 0$. We will use the equation of the line to solve for $x$ when $y = 0$.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The equation of the line is $y = 4 - x$.
- The slope is negative, as indicated by the graph.
- The line passes through the points $(0, 4)$ and $(4, 0)$, which are confirmed by substituting these points into the equation:
  - When $x = 0$, $y = 4 - 0 = 4$.
  - When $x = 4$, $y = 4 - 4 = 0$.

#### Step 2: Determine the $x$-intercept
The $x$-intercept occurs where $y = 0$. To find the $x$-coordinate of the $x$-intercept, substitute $y = 0$ into the equation $y = 4 - x$:
\[
0 = 4 - x
\]
Solve for $x$:
\[
x = 4
\]

#### Step 3: Write the coordinates of the $x$-intercept
The $x$-intercept is the point where $x = 4$ and $y = 0$. Therefore, the coordinates of the $x$-intercept are $(4, 0)$.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(4, 0)}
\]
