QUESTION:
The solid shown is constructed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube. Find its surface area if the side length is 14.2 and the radius is half that.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the surface area of the solid formed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube. Let's proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The side length of the cube is \( s = 14.2 \) cm.
- The radius of the sphere is \( r = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{14.2}{2} = 7.1 \) cm.
- A quarter of a sphere is removed from the cube.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the surface area of the original cube
The surface area of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area of Cube} = 6s^2
\]
Substituting \( s = 14.2 \):
\[
\text{Surface Area of Cube} = 6 \times (14.2)^2 = 6 \times 201.64 = 1209.84 \text{ cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Analyze the effect of removing a quarter of a sphere
When a quarter of a sphere is removed from the cube:
1. **Part of the cube's surface is removed**: The quarter-sphere removes a portion of the cube's surface area.
2. **New curved surface is added**: The curved surface of the quarter-sphere becomes part of the new solid's surface area.

#### Surface area removed from the cube
The quarter-sphere is cut from one corner of the cube, removing a portion of three faces of the cube. Each face is a square with side length \( s \), but only a quarter-circle area is removed from each of these three faces.

The area of a full circle with radius \( r \) is:
\[
\pi r^2
\]
The area of a quarter-circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \pi r^2
\]
Since the quarter-sphere removes a quarter-circle area from three faces of the cube, the total area removed is:
\[
3 \times \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2 = \frac{3}{4} \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 7.1 \):
\[
\frac{3}{4} \pi (7.1)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \pi \times 50.41 = \frac{3}{4} \times 158.4905 = 118.867875 \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### Curved surface area of the quarter-sphere
The curved surface area of a full sphere is:
\[
4 \pi r^2
\]
The curved surface area of a quarter-sphere is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 4 \pi r^2 = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 7.1 \):
\[
\pi (7.1)^2 = \pi \times 50.41 = 158.4905 \text{ cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total surface area of the modified solid
The total surface area of the modified solid is the original surface area of the cube minus the area removed plus the curved surface area of the quarter-sphere:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Surface Area of Cube} - \text{Area Removed} + \text{Curved Surface Area of Quarter-Sphere}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 1209.84 - 118.867875 + 158.4905
\]
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 1209.84 - 118.867875 + 158.4905 = 1249.462625 \text{ cm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1249.46 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
