QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\sin a$.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves finding the value of $\sin a$, where the angle $a$ is in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the unit circle at the point $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The unit circle has a radius of 1, and its center is at the origin $(0, 0)$.

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- The point $P$ lies on the unit circle, so its coordinates are $\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$.
- The unit circle has a radius of 1, meaning the distance from the origin to any point on the circle is 1.
- The sine of an angle in standard position is given by the $y$-coordinate of the point where the terminal side intersects the unit circle.

#### Step 2: Recall the Definition of Sine
For an angle $a$ in standard position, the sine of the angle is defined as:
\[
\sin a = y
\]
where $(x, y)$ are the coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.

#### Step 3: Identify the Coordinates
From the problem, the coordinates of the point $P$ are:
\[
P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)
\]
Here, the $y$-coordinate is $\frac{20}{29}$.

#### Step 4: Apply the Definition of Sine
Since the $y$-coordinate of the point $P$ is $\frac{20}{29}$, we have:
\[
\sin a = \frac{20}{29}
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
The point $P$ lies on the unit circle, so the coordinates satisfy the equation of the unit circle:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
Substitute $x = -\frac{21}{29}$ and $y = \frac{20}{29}$:
\[
\left(-\frac{21}{29}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{20}{29}\right)^2 = \frac{441}{841} + \frac{400}{841} = \frac{841}{841} = 1
\]
This confirms that $P$ is indeed on the unit circle.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{20}{29}}
\]
