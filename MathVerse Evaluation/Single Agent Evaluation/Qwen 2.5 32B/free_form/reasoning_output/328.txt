QUESTION:
Three television presenters are practising their navigation skills before heading off on an expedition to a remote location. Amelia at point B is positioned 17.6 metres south of Ned at point A. Bart at point C is due east of Amelia and on a bearing of S 38^\circ E from Ned. If Ned and Bart are d metres apart, find d to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will analyze the geometric setup step by step and use trigonometric relationships to find the required distance \( d \).

### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup
- Point \( A \) is the reference point where Ned is located.
- Point \( B \) is 17.6 meters directly south of \( A \). Therefore, \( AB = 17.6 \) meters.
- Point \( C \) is due east of \( B \), meaning \( BC \) is horizontal.
- The bearing of \( C \) from \( A \) is \( \text{S } 38^\circ \text{ E} \). This means that if you start at \( A \) and move south, you then turn \( 38^\circ \) eastward to reach \( C \).
- We need to find the distance \( d \), which is the straight-line distance from \( A \) to \( C \).

### Step 2: Define Coordinates and Relationships
- Place \( A \) at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- Since \( B \) is 17.6 meters south of \( A \), the coordinates of \( B \) are \((0, -17.6)\).
- Point \( C \) is due east of \( B \), so its coordinates are \((x, -17.6)\), where \( x \) is the horizontal distance from \( B \) to \( C \).

### Step 3: Use Trigonometry to Relate Angles and Distances
The angle \( \angle CAB = 38^\circ \). This angle is formed between the vertical line through \( A \) (which is the north-south direction) and the line segment \( AC \).

In the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \):
- \( AB = 17.6 \) meters (vertical side).
- \( BC = x \) meters (horizontal side).
- \( AC = d \) meters (hypotenuse).

Using the tangent function for \( \angle CAB \):
\[
\tan(38^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{BC}{AB} = \frac{x}{17.6}
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = 17.6 \cdot \tan(38^\circ)
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( x \)
Using a calculator to find \( \tan(38^\circ) \):
\[
\tan(38^\circ) \approx 0.7813
\]
\[
x = 17.6 \cdot 0.7813 \approx 13.74 \text{ meters}
\]

### Step 5: Find the Distance \( d \)
Now, we use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \) to find \( d \):
\[
d = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{17.6^2 + x^2}
\]
Substitute \( x \approx 13.74 \):
\[
d = \sqrt{17.6^2 + 13.74^2} = \sqrt{309.76 + 188.8076} = \sqrt{498.5676}
\]
\[
d \approx 22.33 \text{ meters}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{22.3}
\]
