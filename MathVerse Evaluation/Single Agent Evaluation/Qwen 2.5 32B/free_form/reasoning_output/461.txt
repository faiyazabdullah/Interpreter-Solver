QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the radius of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the radius of the circle shown in the image, let's follow the solution steps carefully:

---

### **Step 1: Examine the geometric figure and identify given information**
- The image shows a circle on a Cartesian coordinate plane.
- The circle intersects the axes at two points:
  - One point on the negative \( x \)-axis.
  - One point on the positive \( y \)-axis.
- The center of the circle appears to be located near the point \((-3, -3)\).
- The circle is symmetric about its center.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the relationships and constraints**
- Since the circle intersects the axes, the points of intersection are:
  - On the \( x \)-axis: \((x_1, 0)\).
  - On the \( y \)-axis: \((0, y_1)\).
- The distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle is the radius \( r \).

---

### **Step 3: Identify what needs to be found**
- We need to determine the radius \( r \) of the circle.

---

### **Step 4: Apply geometric properties and formulas**
#### **(a) Determine the center of the circle**
- From the image, the center of the circle appears to be \((-3, -3)\). This can be visually estimated, but it is consistent with the symmetry of the circle.

#### **(b) Use the radius formula**
- The radius \( r \) of a circle is the distance from its center \((h, k)\) to any point \((x, y)\) on the circle. The formula for the distance is:
  \[
  r = \sqrt{(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2}
  \]
- Since the circle intersects the \( x \)-axis at \((x_1, 0)\), we can use this point to find \( r \). Let the center be \((-3, -3)\). Then:
  \[
  r = \sqrt{(x_1 - (-3))^2 + (0 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{(x_1 + 3)^2 + 3^2}
  \]

#### **(c) Use the intersection with the \( y \)-axis**
- Similarly, the circle intersects the \( y \)-axis at \((0, y_1)\). Using this point:
  \[
  r = \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (y_1 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (y_1 + 3)^2}
  \]

#### **(d) Estimate the intersection points**
- From the image, the circle intersects the \( x \)-axis near \((-6, 0)\) and the \( y \)-axis near \((0, -6)\). These points are equidistant from the center \((-3, -3)\).

#### **(e) Calculate the radius using one of the intersection points**
- Using the point \((-6, 0)\):
  \[
  r = \sqrt{((-6) - (-3))^2 + (0 - (-3))^2} = \sqrt{(-6 + 3)^2 + (0 + 3)^2} = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
  \]

---

### **Step 5: Verify the result**
- The calculation is consistent with the symmetry of the circle and the estimated intersection points.
- The radius is the same whether calculated using the \( x \)-axis intersection or the \( y \)-axis intersection.

---

### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{3\sqrt{2}}
\]
