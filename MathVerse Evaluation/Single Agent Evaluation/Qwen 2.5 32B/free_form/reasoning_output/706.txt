QUESTION:
Consider the following figure.Find the total surface area of the triangular prism shown. The height is 16cm. The base is an isosceles triangle with waist length of 10cm and base length of 12cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the total surface area of the triangular prism. Let's break down the solution step by step.

---

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The height of the prism is \( h = 16 \, \text{cm} \).
- The base of the triangular prism is an isosceles triangle with:
  - Waist length (equal sides) = \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).
  - Base length = \( 12 \, \text{cm} \).

We need to calculate the total surface area of the prism, which includes:
1. The lateral surface area.
2. The area of the two triangular bases.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the triangular base
The base is an isosceles triangle with:
- Base \( b = 12 \, \text{cm} \).
- Equal sides \( a = 10 \, \text{cm} \).

To find the area of the triangle, we first need its height. We can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from the apex to the midpoint of the base.

#### Step 2.1: Find the height of the isosceles triangle
Let \( x \) be the height of the triangle. When we drop a perpendicular from the apex to the base, it bisects the base into two equal segments of \( 6 \, \text{cm} \) each. This forms two right triangles with:
- Hypotenuse = \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).
- One leg = \( 6 \, \text{cm} \).
- The other leg = \( x \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
a^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]
\[
10^2 = x^2 + 6^2
\]
\[
100 = x^2 + 36
\]
\[
x^2 = 64
\]
\[
x = 8 \, \text{cm}
\]

So, the height of the isosceles triangle is \( x = 8 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the area of the triangular base
The area \( A \) of a triangle is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 8 = 48 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Thus, the area of one triangular base is \( 48 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

---

### Step 3: Calculate the lateral surface area
The lateral surface area consists of three rectangles, each with a height of \( 16 \, \text{cm} \) (the height of the prism) and widths equal to the sides of the triangular base:
1. Two rectangles with width \( 10 \, \text{cm} \) (the waist lengths).
2. One rectangle with width \( 12 \, \text{cm} \) (the base length).

#### Step 3.1: Calculate the area of each rectangular face
- Area of each rectangle with width \( 10 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Area} = 10 \times 16 = 160 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Since there are two such rectangles, their combined area is:
\[
2 \times 160 = 320 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

- Area of the rectangle with width \( 12 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Area} = 12 \times 16 = 192 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 3.2: Total lateral surface area
The total lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of the three rectangles:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 320 + 192 = 512 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total surface area
The total surface area of the prism is the sum of the lateral surface area and the areas of the two triangular bases:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area} + 2 \times \text{Area of one triangular base}
\]
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 512 + 2 \times 48 = 512 + 96 = 608 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{608}
\]
