QUESTION:
Peter received a lump sum payment of $\$ 50000$ for an insurance claim (and decided not to put it in a savings account).

Every month, he withdraws $5 \%$ of the remaining funds.

The funds after $x$ months is shown below. The curve in the graph passes (0,5). y-axis labels"y('0000s)"

How much would the first withdrawal be?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves understanding how Peter's lump sum payment decreases over time due to monthly withdrawals of 5% of the remaining funds. The graph provided shows the relationship between the number of months \( x \) and the remaining funds \( y \), expressed in thousands of dollars (\( y \) in '0000s).

#### Step 1: Interpret the Graph
- The graph shows a straight line, indicating a linear relationship between \( x \) and \( y \).
- The curve passes through the point \( (0, 5) \), which means at \( x = 0 \) (initially), the value of \( y \) is 5. This corresponds to \$50,000 (since \( y \) is in '0000s).

#### Step 2: Understand the Withdrawal Process
- Every month, Peter withdraws 5% of the remaining funds. This means the remaining funds decrease by 5% each month.
- If the initial amount is \( P_0 = 50000 \), the first withdrawal is 5% of \( P_0 \):
  \[
  \text{First withdrawal} = 0.05 \times P_0
  \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the First Withdrawal
- Substitute \( P_0 = 50000 \) into the formula:
  \[
  \text{First withdrawal} = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500
  \]

#### Step 4: Verify with the Graph
- The graph confirms that the initial amount is \$50,000 (point \( (0, 5) \)). The slope of the line indicates a consistent decrease, but the exact calculation of the first withdrawal is straightforward from the given information.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{2500}
\]
