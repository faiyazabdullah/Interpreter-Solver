QUESTION:
There is an odd function f going through (0,0). Estimate the point(s) at which the graph of f has a local maximum or a local minimum.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image is a graph of a function \( f(x) \), which appears to be an odd function since it passes through the origin \((0, 0)\). The task is to estimate the points at which the graph of \( f \) has a local maximum or a local minimum.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Graph
- The graph shows a smooth curve that passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The function appears to have two critical points:
  1. A point where the function reaches a local maximum.
  2. A point where the function reaches a local minimum.
- The arrows indicate the direction of the curve as \( x \to \pm \infty \).

#### Step 2: Identifying Local Maximum and Minimum
A local maximum occurs where the function changes from increasing to decreasing, and a local minimum occurs where the function changes from decreasing to increasing. These points are typically where the derivative \( f'(x) = 0 \) or is undefined, and the sign of the derivative changes around these points.

From the graph:
- The function appears to reach a local maximum near \( x = -2 \).
- The function appears to reach a local minimum near \( x = 2 \).

#### Step 3: Estimating the Points
By visually inspecting the graph:
- The local maximum is near the point \((-2, 60)\).
- The local minimum is near the point \((2, -60)\).

#### Step 4: Verifying the Odd Function Property
Since \( f(x) \) is an odd function, we know that \( f(-x) = -f(x) \). This property is consistent with the symmetry of the graph about the origin. The estimated points \((-2, 60)\) and \((2, -60)\) satisfy this symmetry, confirming the correctness of our estimates.

### Final Answer:
The points at which the graph of \( f \) has a local maximum or a local minimum are approximately:
\[
\boxed{(-2, 60) \text{ and } (2, -60)}
\]
