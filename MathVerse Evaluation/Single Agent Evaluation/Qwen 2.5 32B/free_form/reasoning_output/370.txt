QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, a marked right angled line has a length of 4 and a slanted line has a length of 4*sqrt{2}. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown \theta . Leave your answer in degrees.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the angle \( \theta \) in a right-angled triangle. The given information includes:
- One leg of the triangle has a length of 4.
- The hypotenuse of the triangle has a length of \( 4\sqrt{2} \).
- The triangle is a right-angled triangle, with the right angle marked.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information and relationships
- The right-angled triangle has one leg of length 4 and a hypotenuse of length \( 4\sqrt{2} \).
- We need to find the angle \( \theta \), which is opposite the leg of length 4.

#### Step 2: Use trigonometric relationships
In a right-angled triangle, the sine, cosine, and tangent functions relate the sides to the angles. Here, we can use the sine function:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
where:
- The side opposite \( \theta \) is the leg of length 4.
- The hypotenuse is \( 4\sqrt{2} \).

Thus:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{4}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( \theta \)
The value \( \sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) corresponds to a standard angle in trigonometry. From the unit circle or trigonometric tables, we know:
\[
\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Therefore:
\[
\theta = 45^\circ
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the solution
To ensure correctness, we can check if the triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem:
- One leg = 4
- Hypotenuse = \( 4\sqrt{2} \)
- Let the other leg be \( x \). By the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
4^2 + x^2 = (4\sqrt{2})^2
\]
\[
16 + x^2 = 32
\]
\[
x^2 = 16
\]
\[
x = 4
\]
Since both legs are equal (each 4), the triangle is an isosceles right-angled triangle, confirming that \( \theta = 45^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{45^\circ}
\]
