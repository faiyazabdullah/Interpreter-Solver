QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the average rate of change from the given graph. Let's follow the solution steps carefully:

### Step 1: Examine the Graph
- The graph shows the number of earthquakes over time.
- The x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.
- The data points are plotted at integer values of the year, and they form a horizontal line at \( y = 6 \).

### Step 2: Identify Key Points
From the graph:
- At year \( t = 1 \), the number of earthquakes is \( y = 6 \).
- At year \( t = 2 \), the number of earthquakes is \( y = 6 \).
- At year \( t = 3 \), the number of earthquakes is \( y = 6 \).
- At year \( t = 4 \), the number of earthquakes is \( y = 6 \).

### Step 3: Understand the Question
We are asked to find the **average rate of change**. The average rate of change is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
where:
- \( \Delta y \) is the change in the number of earthquakes,
- \( \Delta x \) is the change in the years.

### Step 4: Calculate the Changes
From the graph:
- The number of earthquakes remains constant at \( y = 6 \) for all years.
- Therefore, \( \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 6 - 6 = 0 \) for any two years \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \).

### Step 5: Compute the Average Rate of Change
Since \( \Delta y = 0 \) for any interval, the average rate of change is:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{0}{\Delta x} = 0
\]

### Final Answer:
The average rate of change is \(\boxed{0}\).
