QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(\frac{20}{29},-\frac{21}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\tan a$.

### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves a point \( P \left( \frac{20}{29}, -\frac{21}{29} \right) \) on the unit circle, which is centered at the origin with radius 1. The angle \( a \) is in standard position, meaning it is measured counterclockwise from the positive \( x \)-axis. We are tasked with finding \( \tan a \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- The point \( P \left( \frac{20}{29}, -\frac{21}{29} \right) \) lies on the unit circle, so its coordinates satisfy the equation of the unit circle:
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = 1.
  \]
- Here, \( x = \frac{20}{29} \) and \( y = -\frac{21}{29} \). We can verify that:
  \[
  \left( \frac{20}{29} \right)^2 + \left( -\frac{21}{29} \right)^2 = \frac{400}{841} + \frac{441}{841} = \frac{841}{841} = 1.
  \]
  This confirms that \( P \) lies on the unit circle.

#### Step 2: Recall the Definition of \( \tan a \)
The tangent of an angle \( a \) in standard position is defined as the ratio of the \( y \)-coordinate to the \( x \)-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle:
\[
\tan a = \frac{y}{x}.
\]

#### Step 3: Substitute the Coordinates of \( P \)
From the coordinates of \( P \), we have:
\[
x = \frac{20}{29} \quad \text{and} \quad y = -\frac{21}{29}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\tan a = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{-\frac{21}{29}}{\frac{20}{29}}.
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the Expression
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\tan a = \frac{-\frac{21}{29}}{\frac{20}{29}} = \frac{-21}{20}.
\]

#### Step 5: Final Answer
The value of \( \tan a \) is:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{21}{20}}.
\]
