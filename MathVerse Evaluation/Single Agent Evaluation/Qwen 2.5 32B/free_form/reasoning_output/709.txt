### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a square pyramid. We are tasked with finding its total surface area. The key information provided is:
- The side length of the base is \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
- The perpendicular height (height from the apex to the center of the base) is \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
- The four slanted edges (lateral edges) are equal in length.

#### Step 1: Identify the components of the surface area
The total surface area of a square pyramid consists of:
1. The area of the base (a square).
2. The area of the four triangular lateral faces.

#### Step 2: Calculate the area of the base
The base is a square with side length \(10 \, \text{cm}\). The area of the base is:
\[
\text{Base Area} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the slant height of the triangular faces
To find the area of the triangular faces, we need the slant height. The slant height is the height of each triangular face, measured from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge.

The slant height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by:
- The perpendicular height of the pyramid (6 cm),
- Half the side length of the base (\(10/2 = 5 \, \text{cm}\)),
- The slant height (\(s\)) as the hypotenuse.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
s = \sqrt{\left(\frac{10}{2}\right)^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{25 + 36} = \sqrt{61}
\]
Thus, the slant height is:
\[
s = \sqrt{61} \, \text{cm}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the area of one triangular face
Each triangular face is an isosceles triangle with:
- Base = \(10 \, \text{cm}\),
- Height = \(\sqrt{61} \, \text{cm}\).

The area of one triangular face is:
\[
\text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times \sqrt{61} = 5\sqrt{61} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the total area of the four triangular faces
Since there are four identical triangular faces, the total area of the lateral faces is:
\[
\text{Lateral Area} = 4 \times 5\sqrt{61} = 20\sqrt{61} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 6: Calculate the total surface area
The total surface area is the sum of the base area and the lateral area:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Base Area} + \text{Lateral Area} = 100 + 20\sqrt{61}
\]

#### Step 7: Approximate the numerical value
Using \(\sqrt{61} \approx 7.81\):
\[
20\sqrt{61} \approx 20 \times 7.81 = 156.2
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 100 + 156.2 = 256.2 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{256.2}
\]
