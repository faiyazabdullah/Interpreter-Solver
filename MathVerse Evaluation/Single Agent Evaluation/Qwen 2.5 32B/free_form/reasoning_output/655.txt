### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a cylinder with the following dimensions:
- Height (\( h \)) = 35 cm
- Radius of the base (\( r \)) = 10 cm

We are tasked with finding the surface area of the cylinder. The surface area of a cylinder consists of three parts:
1. The lateral surface area (the curved surface).
2. The area of the top circular base.
3. The area of the bottom circular base.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Lateral Surface Area:
The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
\]
Substituting the given values \( r = 10 \) cm and \( h = 35 \) cm:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi (10)(35) = 2\pi \cdot 350 = 700\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### 2. Area of One Circular Base:
The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[
\text{Area of one base} = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 10 \) cm:
\[
\text{Area of one base} = \pi (10)^2 = 100\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

Since the cylinder has two bases (top and bottom), the total area of both bases is:
\[
\text{Total area of both bases} = 2 \times 100\pi = 200\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### 3. Total Surface Area:
The total surface area of the cylinder is the sum of the lateral surface area and the areas of the two bases:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area} + \text{Total area of both bases}
\]
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 700\pi + 200\pi = 900\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### 4. Numerical Approximation:
Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 900 \times 3.14159 \approx 2827.43 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{2827.43 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
