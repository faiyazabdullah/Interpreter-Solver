FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the period of the trigonometric function depicted in the graph. Let's analyze the given information and follow the steps systematically.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
1. The function intersects its midline at the point \((1.25, -2.75)\).
2. The function has a minimum point at \((4.75, -6.25)\).
3. The graph shows a periodic function, likely a sine or cosine function.

### Step 2: Identify key features of the function
#### Midline intersection
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that lies midway between its maximum and minimum values. Since the function intersects its midline at \((1.25, -2.75)\), the midline is the horizontal line \(y = -2.75\).

#### Minimum point
The minimum point of the function is given as \((4.75, -6.25)\). This means the function reaches its lowest value at \(x = 4.75\) and the value is \(-6.25\).

### Step 3: Determine the amplitude
The amplitude of a trigonometric function is half the distance between its maximum and minimum values. From the midline \(y = -2.75\):
- The minimum value is \(-6.25\).
- The distance from the midline to the minimum value is:
  \[
  |-6.25 - (-2.75)| = |-6.25 + 2.75| = |-3.5| = 3.5
  \]
Thus, the amplitude is \(3.5\).

### Step 4: Determine the period
The period of a trigonometric function is the horizontal distance between two consecutive points where the function repeats itself. To find the period, we need to identify the horizontal shift between corresponding points on the graph.

#### Key observation
The function intersects its midline at \((1.25, -2.75)\). Since the function is periodic, it will intersect its midline again after completing one full cycle. The next intersection with the midline can be found by analyzing the symmetry of the function.

From the graph, we observe that the function is symmetric and completes one full cycle between the points where it intersects the midline. The distance between two consecutive midline intersections is the period.

#### Calculate the period
The minimum point \((4.75, -6.25)\) is located between two midline intersections. The midline intersection before the minimum point is at \(x = 1.25\), and the midline intersection after the minimum point can be deduced by symmetry. The function is symmetric about the vertical line passing through the minimum point, so the next midline intersection occurs at:
\[
x = 4.75 + (4.75 - 1.25) = 4.75 + 3.5 = 8.25
\]
Thus, the period is the horizontal distance between two consecutive midline intersections, which is:
\[
8.25 - 1.25 = 7
\]

### Final Answer
The period of the function is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
