QUESTION:
The solid in the figure is constructed by 3 segments, 2 of segments are same cylinder on each side of the solid with radius of 11. The cylinder in the middle has radius of 4. Calculate the volume of the solid. Round your answer to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The solid in the figure consists of three segments:
1. Two identical cylindrical segments on either side, each with a radius of 11 and a height of 8.
2. One central cylindrical segment with a radius of 4 and a height of 7.

We are tasked with calculating the total volume of the solid. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Volume of the Left and Right Cylinders
Each of the left and right cylindrical segments has:
- Radius \( r = 11 \)
- Height \( h = 8 \)

The volume of one cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (11)^2 (8) = \pi (121)(8) = 968\pi
\]

Since there are two identical cylinders, their combined volume is:
\[
V_{\text{left and right}} = 2 \times 968\pi = 1936\pi
\]

#### Step 2: Volume of the Central Cylinder
The central cylindrical segment has:
- Radius \( r = 4 \)
- Height \( h = 7 \)

The volume of this cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{central}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4)^2 (7) = \pi (16)(7) = 112\pi
\]

#### Step 3: Total Volume of the Solid
The total volume of the solid is the sum of the volumes of the left and right cylinders and the central cylinder:
\[
V_{\text{total}} = V_{\text{left and right}} + V_{\text{central}} = 1936\pi + 112\pi = 2048\pi
\]

#### Step 4: Numerical Approximation
To find the numerical value, we use \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
V_{\text{total}} = 2048\pi \approx 2048 \times 3.14159 \approx 6433.98144
\]

Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
V_{\text{total}} \approx 6434.0
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{6434.0}
\]
