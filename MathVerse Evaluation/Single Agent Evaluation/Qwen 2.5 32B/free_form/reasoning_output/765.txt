QUESTION:
The graph consists of the rectangle QRPS and the line segment RT, and the point T is on PS. The area of triangle RST is 7 and PT=2/5*PS. What is the area of PQRS?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will follow the solution steps carefully:

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The figure consists of a rectangle \( QRPS \) and a line segment \( RT \).
- Point \( T \) lies on \( PS \).
- The area of triangle \( RST \) is given as 7.
- The relationship \( PT = \frac{2}{5} \cdot PS \) is provided.

We need to find the area of the rectangle \( QRPS \).

### Step 2: Define variables
Let:
- \( PS = b \) (the base of the rectangle),
- \( QR = h \) (the height of the rectangle).

Since \( PT = \frac{2}{5} \cdot PS \), we can express \( PT \) as:
\[ PT = \frac{2}{5}b. \]

This implies that:
\[ TS = PS - PT = b - \frac{2}{5}b = \frac{3}{5}b. \]

### Step 3: Use the area of triangle \( RST \)
The area of triangle \( RST \) is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle RST = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}. \]

Here, the base of \( \triangle RST \) is \( TS = \frac{3}{5}b \), and the height is \( QR = h \). Therefore:
\[ \text{Area of } \triangle RST = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5}b \right) \cdot h. \]

We are given that the area of \( \triangle RST \) is 7. So:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( \frac{3}{5}b \right) \cdot h = 7. \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( bh \)
Simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{5} \cdot b \cdot h = 7, \]
\[ \frac{3}{10} \cdot b \cdot h = 7. \]

Multiply both sides by 10 to clear the fraction:
\[ 3bh = 70. \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ bh = \frac{70}{3}. \]

### Step 5: Find the area of the rectangle \( QRPS \)
The area of the rectangle \( QRPS \) is given by:
\[ \text{Area of } QRPS = PS \cdot QR = b \cdot h. \]

From the previous step, we know:
\[ bh = \frac{70}{3}. \]

Thus, the area of the rectangle \( QRPS \) is:
\[ \text{Area of } QRPS = \frac{70}{3}. \]

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{\frac{70}{3}} \]
