QUESTION:
Find the domain and range of the function f using interval notation, which goes through (-2,-4), (-1,-2), (0,0), (1,-4), with a hollow point (-3,0).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given problem asks us to determine the domain and range of the function \( f \) based on its graph. The graph is provided, and we need to analyze it step by step to extract the required information.

#### Step 1: Examine the Graph
- The graph shows a continuous curve that passes through specific points: 
  - (-2, -4), (-1, -2), (0, 0), and (1, -4).
- There is a hollow point at (-3, 0), indicating that the function is undefined at \( x = -3 \).

#### Step 2: Determine the Domain
The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (\( x \)-values) for which the function is defined. From the graph:
- The curve extends from \( x = -5 \) to \( x = 1 \), but there is a hollow point at \( x = -3 \), meaning \( x = -3 \) is excluded.
- Therefore, the domain is all \( x \)-values in the interval \([-5, 1]\) except \( x = -3 \).

In interval notation:
\[ \text{Domain: } [-5, -3) \cup (-3, 1] \]

#### Step 3: Determine the Range
The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (\( y \)-values) that the function can take. From the graph:
- The lowest point on the graph is at \( y = -4 \), and the highest point is at \( y = 2 \).
- The function takes on all \( y \)-values between -4 and 2, inclusive.

In interval notation:
\[ \text{Range: } [-4, 2] \]

#### Step 4: Combine the Results
We have determined both the domain and the range of the function \( f \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Domain: } [-5, -3) \cup (-3, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [-4, 2]}
\]
