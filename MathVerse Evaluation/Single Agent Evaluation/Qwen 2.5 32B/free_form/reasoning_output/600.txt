QUESTION:
A rectangle is inscribed between the $x$-axis and the parabola $y=36-x^2$ with one side along the $x$-axis, as shown in the figure below. Let $x$ denote the $x$-coordinate of the point highlighted in the figure. Write the area $A$ of the rectangle as a function of $x$.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the area \( A \) of a rectangle inscribed between the \( x \)-axis and the parabola \( y = 36 - x^2 \). The rectangle has one side along the \( x \)-axis, and its top vertices lie on the parabola. The \( x \)-coordinate of the right vertex of the rectangle is denoted as \( x \).

#### Step 1: Identify the dimensions of the rectangle
1. **Width of the rectangle**: Since the rectangle is symmetric about the \( y \)-axis, the width is twice the \( x \)-coordinate of the right vertex. Therefore, the width is \( 2x \).
2. **Height of the rectangle**: The height of the rectangle is the \( y \)-coordinate of the parabola at \( x \). From the equation of the parabola \( y = 36 - x^2 \), the height is \( 36 - x^2 \).

#### Step 2: Write the area of the rectangle
The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the product of its width and height:
\[
A = \text{width} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the expressions for the width and height:
\[
A = (2x) \cdot (36 - x^2)
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the expression for the area
Expanding the product:
\[
A = 2x \cdot (36 - x^2) = 2x \cdot 36 - 2x \cdot x^2 = 72x - 2x^3
\]

#### Step 4: State the final function
The area \( A \) of the rectangle as a function of \( x \) is:
\[
A(x) = 72x - 2x^3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{72x - 2x^3}
\]
