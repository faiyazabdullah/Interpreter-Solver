QUESTION:
Let us find the surface area of the solid given (constructed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder). The radius is 15 cm. The height of cylinder is 22 cm.

Hence, find the total surface area of the shape.

Give our answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the total surface area of the given solid, we need to carefully analyze the geometric figure and apply the appropriate formulas step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The radius of the cylinder and the hemisphere: \( r = 15 \) cm
- The height of the cylinder: \( h = 22 \) cm
- The solid is formed by removing a hemisphere from the top of the cylinder.

### Step 2: Understand the structure of the solid
The solid consists of:
1. The lateral surface area of the cylinder.
2. The base area of the cylinder (since the top is removed).
3. The curved surface area of the hemisphere (which replaces the top of the cylinder).

### Step 3: Calculate each part of the surface area

#### (a) Lateral surface area of the cylinder
The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh
\]
Substitute \( r = 15 \) cm and \( h = 22 \) cm:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi (15)(22) = 660\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### (b) Base area of the cylinder
The base area of the cylinder is the area of the circular base. Since the top of the cylinder is removed, we only consider the bottom base:
\[
\text{Base Area} = \pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 15 \) cm:
\[
\text{Base Area} = \pi (15)^2 = 225\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### (c) Curved surface area of the hemisphere
The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 15 \) cm:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi (15)^2 = 2\pi (225) = 450\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Total surface area of the solid
The total surface area of the solid is the sum of the lateral surface area of the cylinder, the base area of the cylinder, and the curved surface area of the hemisphere:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area} + \text{Base Area} + \text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere}
\]
Substitute the values calculated:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 660\pi + 225\pi + 450\pi = 1335\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Step 5: Approximate the numerical value
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 1335 \times 3.14159 \approx 4191.08 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4191.08 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
