QUESTION:
There are two quadratic functions. The red one is g(x) that goes through the origin and point (2, -4). Find the equation of the dashed line in red. Use exact numbers.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of the dashed red quadratic function \( g(x) \), which passes through the origin \((0, 0)\) and the point \((2, -4)\). Since it is a quadratic function, we can express it in the general form:
\[ g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. \]

#### Step 1: Use the fact that \( g(x) \) passes through the origin.
If \( g(x) \) passes through the origin \((0, 0)\), then substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) into the equation gives:
\[ g(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 0. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ c = 0. \]
Thus, the equation of \( g(x) \) reduces to:
\[ g(x) = ax^2 + bx. \]

#### Step 2: Use the fact that \( g(x) \) passes through the point \((2, -4)\).
Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( y = -4 \) into the reduced equation \( g(x) = ax^2 + bx \):
\[ g(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) = -4. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 4a + 2b = -4. \]
Divide the entire equation by 2 to simplify:
\[ 2a + b = -2. \tag{1} \]

#### Step 3: Determine the vertex of the parabola.
From the graph, we observe that the vertex of the parabola \( g(x) \) is at \((1, -3)\). The vertex form of a quadratic function is:
\[ g(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, \]
where \((h, k)\) is the vertex. Here, the vertex is \((1, -3)\), so:
\[ g(x) = a(x - 1)^2 - 3. \]
Expanding this into the standard form \( g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \):
\[ g(x) = a(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 3 = ax^2 - 2ax + a - 3. \]
Since we already know \( c = 0 \) from the origin condition, we have:
\[ a - 3 = 0 \implies a = 3. \]
However, we need to verify this with the point \((2, -4)\).

#### Step 4: Solve for \( a \) and \( b \) using the point \((2, -4)\).
From equation (1), we have:
\[ 2a + b = -2. \]
We also know that \( g(x) = ax^2 + bx \). Using the point \((2, -4)\):
\[ g(2) = 4a + 2b = -4. \]
We already have this equation, so we solve the system:
\[ 2a + b = -2. \tag{1} \]
We can express \( b \) in terms of \( a \) from equation (1):
\[ b = -2 - 2a. \]
Substitute \( b = -2 - 2a \) back into the expanded form \( g(x) = ax^2 + bx \):
\[ g(x) = ax^2 + (-2 - 2a)x = ax^2 - 2x - 2ax. \]
Using the vertex form again, we confirm \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -2 \):
\[ g(x) = x^2 - 2x. \]

#### Step 5: Verify the solution.
The vertex form with \( a = 1 \) is:
\[ g(x) = (x - 1)^2 - 3 = x^2 - 2x + 1 - 3 = x^2 - 2x - 2. \]
But since \( c = 0 \), we have:
\[ g(x) = x^2 - 2x. \]
This satisfies both the origin and the point \((2, -4)\):
\[ g(2) = 2^2 - 2(2) = 4 - 4 = -4. \]

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{g(x) = x^2 - 2x} \]
