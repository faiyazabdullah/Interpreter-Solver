### Problem Analysis:
The given geometric figure is a closed cylinder. We are tasked with finding the height \( h \) of the cylinder, given:
- The surface area \( S = 27288 \, \text{mm}^2 \),
- The radius \( r = 43 \, \text{mm} \).

#### Step 1: Recall the formula for the surface area of a closed cylinder.
The total surface area \( S \) of a closed cylinder is given by:
\[
S = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circular bases,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder,
- \( 2\pi r^2 \) is the combined area of the two circular bases,
- \( 2\pi rh \) is the lateral surface area.

#### Step 2: Substitute the known values into the formula.
We are given:
- \( S = 27288 \, \text{mm}^2 \),
- \( r = 43 \, \text{mm} \).

Substitute these values into the surface area formula:
\[
27288 = 2\pi (43)^2 + 2\pi (43)h
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the equation.
First, calculate \( 2\pi (43)^2 \):
\[
(43)^2 = 1849
\]
\[
2\pi (43)^2 = 2\pi \cdot 1849 = 3698\pi
\]

Next, rewrite the equation:
\[
27288 = 3698\pi + 2\pi (43)h
\]

Factor out \( 2\pi \) from the terms involving \( h \):
\[
27288 = 3698\pi + 2\pi \cdot 43h
\]
\[
27288 = 3698\pi + 86\pi h
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( h \).
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( h \):
\[
27288 - 3698\pi = 86\pi h
\]

Divide both sides by \( 86\pi \):
\[
h = \frac{27288 - 3698\pi}{86\pi}
\]

#### Step 5: Approximate the value of \( \pi \).
Use \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \) for calculations.

First, calculate \( 3698\pi \):
\[
3698\pi \approx 3698 \cdot 3.14159 \approx 11624.98
\]

Next, calculate \( 86\pi \):
\[
86\pi \approx 86 \cdot 3.14159 \approx 270.07
\]

Now substitute these approximations back into the equation for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{27288 - 11624.98}{270.07}
\]

Calculate the numerator:
\[
27288 - 11624.98 = 15663.02
\]

Finally, divide:
\[
h \approx \frac{15663.02}{270.07} \approx 58
\]

#### Step 6: Round to the nearest whole number.
The calculated value of \( h \) is approximately 58 mm. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:
\[
h \approx 58
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{58}
\]
