QUESTION:
In the diagram, the solid is 3 cm thick. The edge is 9 cm and the angle is 45Â°. Calculate the volume of the solid, correct to one decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The given problem describes a solid with specific dimensions and an angle. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:
- The solid has a thickness of \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
- One side of the solid measures \(9 \, \text{cm}\).
- Another side of the solid measures \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
- The angle between these two sides is \(45^\circ\).

The task is to calculate the volume of the solid. To do this, we need to determine the area of the cross-section (a sector of a triangle) and then multiply it by the thickness of the solid.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
The figure resembles a triangular prism with a sector-like cross-section. The key components are:
1. **Base**: The base of the solid is a right triangle with one angle of \(45^\circ\) and sides of lengths \(9 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
2. **Thickness**: The solid has a uniform thickness of \(3 \, \text{cm}\).

The area of the cross-section (triangle) will be calculated first, and then multiplied by the thickness to find the volume.

---

### Step 2: Calculating the Area of the Cross-Section
The cross-section is a right triangle with one angle of \(45^\circ\). In a right triangle with a \(45^\circ\) angle, the two legs are equal if the triangle is isosceles. However, here the legs are given as \(9 \, \text{cm}\) and \(3 \, \text{cm}\), so we use the standard formula for the area of a triangle:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is \(9 \, \text{cm}\) and the height is \(3 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 27 = 13.5 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculating the Volume
The volume of the solid is the product of the area of the cross-section and the thickness:
\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Area of the cross-section} \times \text{Thickness}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Volume} = 13.5 \times 3 = 40.5 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{40.5 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
