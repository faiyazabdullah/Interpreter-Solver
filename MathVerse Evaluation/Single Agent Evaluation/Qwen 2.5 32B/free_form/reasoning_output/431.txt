QUESTION:
Iainâ€™s car has run out of petrol. He walks 12 km west and then 9 km south looking for a petrol station.

If he is now $h$ km directly from his starting point, find the value of $h$.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the solution steps carefully:

### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Figure and Given Information
The image shows a right triangle with:
- One leg of length \( 12 \) km (westward displacement).
- Another leg of length \( 9 \) km (southward displacement).
- The hypotenuse \( h \) represents the straight-line distance from the starting point to the final position.

The problem states that Iain walks 12 km west and then 9 km south. The goal is to find the straight-line distance \( h \) from his starting point.

### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
The geometric figure is a right triangle where:
- The horizontal leg (westward) is 12 km.
- The vertical leg (southward) is 9 km.
- The hypotenuse \( h \) is the direct distance from the starting point to the ending point.

### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the value of \( h \), the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Formulas
The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
h^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of the legs of the right triangle, and \( h \) is the hypotenuse.

Here:
- \( a = 12 \) km
- \( b = 9 \) km

Substitute these values into the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
h^2 = 12^2 + 9^2
\]

### Step 5: Perform the Calculations
Calculate \( 12^2 \) and \( 9^2 \):
\[
12^2 = 144
\]
\[
9^2 = 81
\]

Add these values:
\[
h^2 = 144 + 81 = 225
\]

Take the square root of both sides to solve for \( h \):
\[
h = \sqrt{225} = 15
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
