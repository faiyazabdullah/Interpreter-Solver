QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (2,-3) and (-8,-3). It's center is at (-3,-3) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at ($-3-5\sqrt{2}$,-3) and ($-3+5\sqrt{2}$,-3). Find the equation of the hyperbola.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given hyperbola is centered at \((-3, -3)\), with vertices at \((2, -3)\) and \((-8, -3)\), and foci at \((-3 - 5\sqrt{2}, -3)\) and \((-3 + 5\sqrt{2}, -3)\). The goal is to find the equation of the hyperbola.

#### Step 1: Identify Key Properties
1. **Center**: The center of the hyperbola is \((-3, -3)\).
2. **Vertices**: The vertices are \((2, -3)\) and \((-8, -3)\). Since these points lie horizontally along the same y-coordinate as the center, the transverse axis is horizontal.
3. **Foci**: The foci are \((-3 - 5\sqrt{2}, -3)\) and \((-3 + 5\sqrt{2}, -3)\). The distance from the center to each focus is \(c\).

#### Step 2: Determine the Transverse Axis Length
The distance between the vertices is the length of the transverse axis, which is \(2a\):
\[
\text{Distance between vertices} = |2 - (-8)| = |2 + 8| = 10.
\]
Thus,
\[
2a = 10 \implies a = 5.
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the Distance to the Foci
The distance from the center to each focus is \(c\). The foci are located at \((-3 - 5\sqrt{2}, -3)\) and \((-3 + 5\sqrt{2}, -3)\). The distance from the center \((-3, -3)\) to either focus is:
\[
c = 5\sqrt{2}.
\]

#### Step 4: Relate \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)
For a hyperbola, the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
\]
Substitute \(a = 5\) and \(c = 5\sqrt{2}\):
\[
(5\sqrt{2})^2 = 5^2 + b^2 \implies 50 = 25 + b^2 \implies b^2 = 25.
\]
Thus,
\[
b = 5.
\]

#### Step 5: Write the Equation of the Hyperbola
The standard form of a horizontal hyperbola centered at \((h, k)\) is:
\[
\frac{(x - h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y - k)^2}{b^2} = 1.
\]
Here, the center \((h, k) = (-3, -3)\), \(a^2 = 25\), and \(b^2 = 25\). Substituting these values, we get:
\[
\frac{(x + 3)^2}{25} - \frac{(y + 3)^2}{25} = 1.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{(x + 3)^2}{25} - \frac{(y + 3)^2}{25} = 1}
\]
