QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the triangular prism shown. The height is 20 cm. The base is right triangle with edges of length 6 cm, 8 cm and 10 cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem of finding the surface area of the triangular prism, let's follow the solution steps carefully.

---

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The prism is a **triangular prism**.
- The base of the prism is a **right triangle** with sides:
  - One leg = 6 cm,
  - Another leg = 8 cm,
  - Hypotenuse = 10 cm (the hypotenuse is confirmed as the right triangle satisfies the Pythagorean theorem: \(6^2 + 8^2 = 10^2\)).
- The height of the prism (the distance perpendicular to the triangular base) is **20 cm**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the components of the surface area
The surface area of a triangular prism consists of:
1. **Two triangular bases** (one at the top and one at the bottom).
2. **Three rectangular lateral faces** (each face corresponds to one side of the triangular base).

Thus, the total surface area \(A\) is given by:
\[
A = 2 \times (\text{Area of one triangular base}) + \text{Perimeter of the triangular base} \times \text{Height of the prism}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the area of one triangular base
The base is a right triangle with legs of lengths 6 cm and 8 cm. The area \(A_{\text{triangle}}\) of a right triangle is given by:
\[
A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base and height of the triangle are the two legs:
\[
A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8 = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of the triangular base
The perimeter \(P\) of the triangular base is the sum of its three sides:
\[
P = 6 + 8 + 10 = 24 \text{ cm}
\]

---

### Step 5: Calculate the area of the three rectangular lateral faces
Each rectangular face has one dimension equal to the height of the prism (20 cm) and the other dimension equal to one of the sides of the triangular base. Therefore, the areas of the three rectangular faces are:
1. Rectangle corresponding to the side of length 6 cm:
   \[
   \text{Area}_1 = 6 \times 20 = 120 \text{ cm}^2
   \]
2. Rectangle corresponding to the side of length 8 cm:
   \[
   \text{Area}_2 = 8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ cm}^2
   \]
3. Rectangle corresponding to the side of length 10 cm:
   \[
   \text{Area}_3 = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cm}^2
   \]

The total area of the three rectangular faces is:
\[
\text{Total lateral area} = 120 + 160 + 200 = 480 \text{ cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 6: Calculate the total surface area
The total surface area \(A\) is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the three rectangular lateral faces:
\[
A = 2 \times (\text{Area of one triangular base}) + \text{Total lateral area}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
A = 2 \times 24 + 480 = 48 + 480 = 528 \text{ cm}^2
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{528 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
