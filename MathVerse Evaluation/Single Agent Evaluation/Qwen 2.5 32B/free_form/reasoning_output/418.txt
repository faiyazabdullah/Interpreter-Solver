QUESTION:
The perimeter is the total length of all sides of a figure.Find the perimeter of the kite shown.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
The image shows a kite, which is a quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent sides that are equal in length. The lengths of the sides are labeled as follows:
- Two pairs of adjacent sides are marked as \(24 \, \text{mm}\) and \(13 \, \text{mm}\).

#### Step 2: Understand the problem
We are tasked with finding the perimeter of the kite. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.

#### Step 3: Recall the formula for the perimeter of a kite
The perimeter \(P\) of a kite can be calculated using the formula:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length of one pair of adjacent sides}) + 2 \times (\text{length of the other pair of adjacent sides})
\]

#### Step 4: Substitute the given values
From the image:
- One pair of adjacent sides has a length of \(24 \, \text{mm}\).
- The other pair of adjacent sides has a length of \(13 \, \text{mm}\).

Using the formula:
\[
P = 2 \times 24 + 2 \times 13
\]

#### Step 5: Perform the calculations
First, calculate \(2 \times 24\):
\[
2 \times 24 = 48
\]

Next, calculate \(2 \times 13\):
\[
2 \times 13 = 26
\]

Now, add these results together:
\[
P = 48 + 26 = 74
\]

#### Step 6: State the final answer
The perimeter of the kite is \(74 \, \text{mm}\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{74 \, \text{mm}}
\]
