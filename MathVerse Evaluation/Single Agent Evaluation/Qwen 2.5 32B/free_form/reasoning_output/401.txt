### Problem Analysis:
The image depicts a figure that appears to be a sector of a circle. The radius of the circle is given as \( 7 \, \text{cm} \), and the problem states that the area of the figure is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the area of the full circle. Our task is to calculate the area of the figure.

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- Radius of the circle: \( r = 7 \, \text{cm} \).
- The area of the figure is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the area of the full circle.

#### Step 2: Recall the Formula for the Area of a Circle
The area \( A \) of a full circle is given by:
\[
A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 7 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
A_{\text{circle}} = \pi (7)^2 = 49\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Figure
The problem states that the area of the figure is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the area of the full circle. Therefore, the area of the figure \( A_{\text{figure}} \) is:
\[
A_{\text{figure}} = \frac{3}{4} \times A_{\text{circle}}
\]
Substitute \( A_{\text{circle}} = 49\pi \):
\[
A_{\text{figure}} = \frac{3}{4} \times 49\pi = \frac{147\pi}{4} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
The area of the full circle is \( 49\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \). Taking \( \frac{3}{4} \) of this area gives:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 49\pi = \frac{147\pi}{4}
\]
This confirms our calculation is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{147\pi}{4} \text{ cm}^2}
\]
