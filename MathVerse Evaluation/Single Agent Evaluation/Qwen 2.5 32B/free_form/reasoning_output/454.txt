### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) of a coordinate plane. The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis at four points. To determine the radius of the circle, we need to analyze the coordinates of these intersection points.

#### Step 1: Identify Intersection Points
From the image:
- The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at two points: \((-2, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\).
- The circle intersects the \(y\)-axis at two points: \((0, 2)\) and \((0, -2)\).

#### Step 2: Determine the Radius
The radius of a circle is the distance from its center to any point on its circumference. Since the circle is centered at the origin \((0, 0)\), the radius can be calculated as the distance from \((0, 0)\) to any of the intersection points.

Let's calculate the radius using the point \((2, 0)\):
- The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
  \[
  d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
  \]
- Here, the center is \((0, 0)\) and the point is \((2, 0)\). Substituting these coordinates:
  \[
  \text{Radius} = \sqrt{(2 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
  \]

#### Step 3: Verify Using Other Points
To ensure consistency, let's verify the radius using another intersection point, such as \((0, 2)\):
- Using the distance formula again:
  \[
  \text{Radius} = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (2 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{4} = 2
  \]

All intersection points confirm that the radius is consistently \(2\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
