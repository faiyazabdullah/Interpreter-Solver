### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a rectangular prism with dimensions:
- Length \( AB = 9 \)
- Width \( BC = 4 \)
- Height \( BF = 5 \)

We are tasked with finding the length of \( AG \). From the diagram, \( AG \) is a diagonal that extends from vertex \( A \) to vertex \( G \), passing through the interior of the rectangular prism. This involves calculating the spatial diagonal of the rectangular prism.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
The rectangular prism has:
- Base \( ABCD \) with side lengths \( AB = 9 \) and \( AD = 4 \).
- Height \( BF = 5 \), which is perpendicular to the base.

The diagonal \( AG \) can be visualized as follows:
- First, find the diagonal of the base \( AC \) (a 2D diagonal in the plane of the rectangle \( ABCD \)).
- Then, use the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions to find the spatial diagonal \( AG \).

#### Step 2: Calculate the Diagonal of the Base \( AC \)
The base \( ABCD \) is a rectangle with sides \( AB = 9 \) and \( AD = 4 \). The diagonal \( AC \) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2} = \sqrt{9^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{81 + 16} = \sqrt{97}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Spatial Diagonal \( AG \)
Now, consider the right triangle \( ACG \) where:
- \( AC \) is one leg of the triangle (the diagonal of the base).
- \( CG \) is the other leg, which is equal to the height of the prism, \( BF = 5 \).
- \( AG \) is the hypotenuse of this right triangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem again:
\[
AG = \sqrt{AC^2 + CG^2} = \sqrt{(\sqrt{97})^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{97 + 25} = \sqrt{122}
\]

#### Step 4: Final Answer
The length of \( AG \) is \( \sqrt{122} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{122}}
\]
