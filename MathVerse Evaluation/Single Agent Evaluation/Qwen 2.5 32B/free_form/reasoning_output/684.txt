FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves calculating the area of a triangular divider placed inside a rectangular prism. The dimensions of the prism are provided: \( AB = 19 \, \text{cm} \), \( BC = 9 \, \text{cm} \), and \( CD = 9 \, \text{cm} \). The triangular divider is a right triangle with its hypotenuse along the diagonal of the base rectangle and one leg along the height of the prism.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The base of the prism is a rectangle with dimensions \( AB = 19 \, \text{cm} \) and \( BC = 9 \, \text{cm} \).
- The height of the prism is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \).
- The triangular divider forms a right triangle with:
  - One leg along the height of the prism (\( 9 \, \text{cm} \)).
  - The other leg along the diagonal of the base rectangle.
  - The hypotenuse is the slanted edge of the triangular divider.

#### Step 2: Calculate the diagonal of the base rectangle
The base rectangle has sides \( AB = 19 \, \text{cm} \) and \( BC = 9 \, \text{cm} \). The diagonal \( AC \) of the base rectangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{19^2 + 9^2} = \sqrt{361 + 81} = \sqrt{442}
\]
Thus, the diagonal \( AC \) is \( \sqrt{442} \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 3: Determine the area of the triangular divider
The triangular divider is a right triangle with:
- One leg = height of the prism = \( 9 \, \text{cm} \).
- The other leg = diagonal of the base rectangle = \( \sqrt{442} \, \text{cm} \).

The area \( A \) of a right triangle is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is \( \sqrt{442} \, \text{cm} \) and the height is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \). Therefore:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{442} \times 9
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the expression
First, calculate \( \sqrt{442} \):
\[
\sqrt{442} \approx 21.02
\]
Now, substitute this value into the area formula:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 21.02 \times 9 = \frac{1}{2} \times 189.18 = 94.59
\]

#### Step 5: Round the result to two decimal places
The area of the triangular divider is approximately \( 94.59 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{94.59}
\]
