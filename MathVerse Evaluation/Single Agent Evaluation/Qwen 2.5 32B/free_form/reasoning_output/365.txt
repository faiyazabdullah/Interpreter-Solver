QUESTION:
The airtraffic controller is communicating with a plane in flight approaching an airport for landing. The plane is 10369 metres above the ground and is still 23444 metres from the runway. If \theta Â° is the angle at which the plane should approach, find \theta  to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the solution steps carefully:

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
The image shows a right triangle where:
- The height of the plane above the ground is \( 10369 \) meters.
- The horizontal distance from the plane to the runway is \( 23444 \) meters.
- The angle of approach, denoted as \( \theta \), is the angle formed between the horizontal ground and the line connecting the plane to the point directly below it on the ground.

### Step 2: Identify the geometric relationship
The problem involves a right triangle with:
- Opposite side: The height of the plane above the ground, \( 10369 \) meters.
- Adjacent side: The horizontal distance from the plane to the runway, \( 23444 \) meters.
- Hypotenuse: The direct distance from the plane to the point on the runway, but we don't need it here.

The angle \( \theta \) can be found using the tangent function, which relates the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{10369}{23444}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \tan(\theta) \)
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{10369}{23444} \approx 0.4422
\]

### Step 4: Find \( \theta \) using the inverse tangent function
To find \( \theta \), we use the inverse tangent function (\( \arctan \)):
\[
\theta = \arctan(0.4422)
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
\theta \approx 23.7^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Round to one decimal place
The angle \( \theta \) rounded to one decimal place is \( 23.7^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{23.7^\circ}
\]
