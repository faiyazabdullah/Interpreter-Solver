QUESTION:
The volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere is given by the formula:

V=\frac{1}{4}\pi h\left(4r^2-h^2\right)

where r is the radius of the sphere and h is the height of the cylinder.

What is the radius of the sphere if the volume of the cylinder is 13.75\pi cm3 and the height of the cylinder is 5 cm?

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the radius \( r \) of a sphere given that a cylinder fits exactly into it. The volume of the cylinder is provided as \( 13.75\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \), and the height of the cylinder is \( h = 5 \, \text{cm} \). The formula for the volume of the cylinder is given by:

\[
V = \frac{1}{4}\pi h \left(4r^2 - h^2\right)
\]

### Step 1: Substitute the known values into the volume formula.
The volume \( V \) of the cylinder is \( 13.75\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \), and the height \( h \) is \( 5 \, \text{cm} \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
13.75\pi = \frac{1}{4}\pi (5) \left(4r^2 - 5^2\right)
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the equation.
First, cancel out \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[
13.75 = \frac{1}{4}(5) \left(4r^2 - 25\right)
\]

Next, simplify the right-hand side:

\[
13.75 = \frac{5}{4} \left(4r^2 - 25\right)
\]

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
4 \cdot 13.75 = 5 \left(4r^2 - 25\right)
\]

\[
55 = 5 \left(4r^2 - 25\right)
\]

Divide both sides by 5:

\[
11 = 4r^2 - 25
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( r^2 \).
Add 25 to both sides:

\[
11 + 25 = 4r^2
\]

\[
36 = 4r^2
\]

Divide both sides by 4:

\[
r^2 = 9
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( r \).
Take the square root of both sides:

\[
r = \sqrt{9}
\]

\[
r = 3
\]

### Final Answer:
The radius of the sphere is \( r = 3 \, \text{cm} \).

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
