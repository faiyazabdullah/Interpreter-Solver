QUESTION:
A hole is drilled through a rectangular box forming the solid shown. The box has sides of length 10cm, 8cm and 14cm. The radius of hole is 2cm. Find the volume of the solid, correct to two decimal places.

### Problem Analysis:
The geometric figure depicts a rectangular box with dimensions \(10 \, \text{cm} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 14 \, \text{cm}\). A cylindrical hole with a radius of \(2 \, \text{cm}\) has been drilled through the box. The task is to find the volume of the resulting solid after the hole is drilled.

#### Step 1: Volume of the Rectangular Box
The volume \(V_{\text{box}}\) of a rectangular box is given by:
\[
V_{\text{box}} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the given dimensions:
\[
V_{\text{box}} = 10 \, \text{cm} \times 8 \, \text{cm} \times 14 \, \text{cm} = 1120 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2: Volume of the Cylindrical Hole
The volume \(V_{\text{cylinder}}\) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
Here, the radius \(r\) of the cylinder is \(2 \, \text{cm}\), and the height \(h\) of the cylinder is equal to the length of the box along which the cylinder is drilled. From the diagram, the cylinder appears to be drilled along the \(14 \, \text{cm}\) dimension. Therefore:
\[
r = 2 \, \text{cm}, \quad h = 14 \, \text{cm}
\]
Substituting these values:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (2)^2 (14) = \pi \cdot 4 \cdot 14 = 56\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 3: Volume of the Solid After Drilling
The volume of the solid after the cylindrical hole is drilled is the volume of the original box minus the volume of the cylindrical hole:
\[
V_{\text{solid}} = V_{\text{box}} - V_{\text{cylinder}}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
V_{\text{solid}} = 1120 - 56\pi
\]

#### Step 4: Numerical Calculation
Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
56\pi \approx 56 \times 3.14159 = 175.9296 \, \text{cm}^3
\]
Thus:
\[
V_{\text{solid}} \approx 1120 - 175.9296 = 944.0704 \, \text{cm}^3
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
V_{\text{solid}} \approx 944.07 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{944.07 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
