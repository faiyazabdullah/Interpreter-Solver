QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the midline equation of the function? Give an exact expression.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the midline equation of the trigonometric function given its minimum and maximum points. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The minimum point of the function is at \(\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)\).
- The maximum point of the function is at \(\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)\).

### Step 2: Understand the midline
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that lies exactly halfway between the maximum and minimum values of the function. It is given by the average of the maximum and minimum \(y\)-values.

### Step 3: Extract the \(y\)-coordinates of the minimum and maximum points
- The \(y\)-coordinate of the minimum point is \(2.4\).
- The \(y\)-coordinate of the maximum point is \(13\).

### Step 4: Calculate the midline
The midline is the average of the maximum and minimum \(y\)-values:
\[
\text{Midline} = \frac{\text{Maximum } y\text{-value} + \text{Minimum } y\text{-value}}{2}
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\text{Midline} = \frac{13 + 2.4}{2}
\]
Perform the addition:
\[
13 + 2.4 = 15.4
\]
Now divide by 2:
\[
\frac{15.4}{2} = 7.7
\]

### Step 5: Write the midline equation
The midline is a horizontal line, so its equation is:
\[
y = 7.7
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y = 7.7}
\]
