QUESTION:
Consider the halfpipe with a diameter of 8 cm.

Find its volume, rounding to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:
The image depicts a halfpipe, which is essentially a semicircular cylinder. The key dimensions provided are:
- Diameter of the semicircular base: \( 8 \, \text{cm} \)
- Length of the halfpipe: \( 20 \, \text{cm} \)

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- The halfpipe is formed by rotating a semicircle around its diameter and then cutting it along its length.
- The volume of the halfpipe can be calculated as half the volume of a full cylinder with the same dimensions.

#### Step 2: Identify Relevant Formulas
- The volume \( V \) of a full cylinder is given by:
  \[
  V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
  \]
  where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height (or length) of the cylinder.
- Since the halfpipe is half of a full cylinder, its volume \( V_{\text{halfpipe}} \) is:
  \[
  V_{\text{halfpipe}} = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{cylinder}}
  \]

#### Step 3: Extract Dimensions
- The diameter of the semicircular base is \( 8 \, \text{cm} \). Therefore, the radius \( r \) is:
  \[
  r = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \, \text{cm}
  \]
- The length (or height) \( h \) of the halfpipe is given as \( 20 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 4: Calculate the Volume
1. First, calculate the volume of the full cylinder:
   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4)^2 (20) = \pi (16)(20) = 320\pi \, \text{cm}^3
   \]
2. Since the halfpipe is half of this volume:
   \[
   V_{\text{halfpipe}} = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{cylinder}} = \frac{1}{2} (320\pi) = 160\pi \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

#### Step 5: Approximate the Volume
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
V_{\text{halfpipe}} = 160\pi \approx 160 \times 3.14159 = 502.6544 \, \text{cm}^3
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
V_{\text{halfpipe}} \approx 502.65 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{502.65 \text{ cm}^3}
\]
