QUESTION:
Takoda is watching the tides off the coast of Cape Cod. For two days, Takoda records the height of the water, $h$, in feet. His results are shown in the graph below, where $t$ corresponds to the number of hours after 12:00 a.m. According to Takoda's research, approximately how much time passes between two consecutive high tides?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given graph, which represents the height of the water \( h \) as a function of time \( t \). The goal is to determine the time interval between two consecutive high tides.

### Step 1: Examine the Graph
- The graph shows a periodic pattern, indicating that the tide heights repeat at regular intervals.
- The horizontal axis (\( t \)) represents time in hours, starting from 12:00 a.m.
- The vertical axis (\( h \)) represents the height of the water in feet.

### Step 2: Identify High Tides
- High tides occur at the peaks of the graph.
- From the graph, we can observe the following times when high tides occur:
  - First high tide: Approximately \( t = 4 \) hours.
  - Second high tide: Approximately \( t = 20 \) hours.
  - Third high tide: Approximately \( t = 36 \) hours.

### Step 3: Calculate the Time Interval Between Consecutive High Tides
- The time difference between the first and second high tides is:
  \[
  20 - 4 = 16 \text{ hours}
  \]
- The time difference between the second and third high tides is:
  \[
  36 - 20 = 16 \text{ hours}
  \]

### Step 4: Verify the Periodicity
- The consistent time interval of 16 hours between consecutive high tides confirms that the pattern is periodic with a period of 16 hours.

### Step 5: Answer the Question
- According to Takoda's research and the graph, the time that passes between two consecutive high tides is approximately 16 hours.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
