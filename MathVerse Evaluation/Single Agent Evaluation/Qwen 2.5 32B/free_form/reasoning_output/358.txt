QUESTION:
Consider the following diagram. The height of the dashed line in the figure is 68. The angle enclosed by the blue arc is 46°, and the angle enclosed by the red arc is 37°. Hence, use the rounded values of y and w to find x, correct to 1 decimal place.

### Problem Analysis:
The given figure consists of a rectangle with dimensions \( y \) (width) and 68 (height). There are two triangles formed by diagonal lines, and the angles at the bottom-left corner of the rectangle are marked as \( 37^\circ \) and \( 46^\circ \). The goal is to find the value of \( x \), which is the horizontal distance from the top-left corner of the rectangle to the intersection point of the diagonals.

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- The height of the rectangle is 68.
- The width of the rectangle is \( y \).
- The angle \( 37^\circ \) is formed by the diagonal from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner.
- The angle \( 46^\circ \) is formed by the diagonal from the bottom-left corner to the top-middle part of the rectangle.
- We need to determine \( x \), the horizontal distance from the left edge of the rectangle to the intersection point of the two diagonals.

#### Step 2: Use Trigonometry to Find \( y \) and \( w \)
From the diagram:
1. **Triangle with \( 37^\circ \)**:
   - This triangle has a height of 68 and an angle of \( 37^\circ \).
   - The tangent of \( 37^\circ \) relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (width):
     \[
     \tan(37^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{68}{y}
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{68}{\tan(37^\circ)}
     \]
     Using \( \tan(37^\circ) \approx 0.7536 \):
     \[
     y \approx \frac{68}{0.7536} \approx 89.6
     \]

2. **Triangle with \( 46^\circ \)**:
   - This triangle has a height of 68 and an angle of \( 46^\circ \).
   - Similarly, the tangent of \( 46^\circ \) relates the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (width \( w \)):
     \[
     \tan(46^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{68}{w}
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{68}{\tan(46^\circ)}
     \]
     Using \( \tan(46^\circ) \approx 1.0355 \):
     \[
     w \approx \frac{68}{1.0355} \approx 65.7
     \]

#### Step 3: Determine \( x \)
- The total width of the rectangle is \( y \approx 89.6 \).
- The horizontal distance \( x \) is the portion of the width from the left edge to the intersection point of the diagonals.
- From the geometry, \( x \) can be expressed as:
  \[
  x = y - w
  \]
  Substituting the values of \( y \) and \( w \):
  \[
  x \approx 89.6 - 65.7 \approx 23.9
  \]

#### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{23.9}
\]
