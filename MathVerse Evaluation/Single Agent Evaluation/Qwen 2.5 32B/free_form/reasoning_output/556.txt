QUESTION:
On the following unit circle, $\theta$ is in radians and $\tan (\theta)=\frac{0.98}{0.2}=4.9$. Without a calculator, evaluate the following expressions to the nearest hundredth or as an exact ratio.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a unit circle centered at the origin. The point \((0.2, 0.98)\) lies on the circumference of the circle. The angle \(\theta\) is formed between the positive \(x\)-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point \((0.2, 0.98)\).

From the problem statement, we know:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{0.98}{0.2} = 4.9
\]
We are tasked with evaluating certain expressions related to \(\theta\). Let us proceed step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
The point \((0.2, 0.98)\) is on the unit circle, so its coordinates satisfy the equation:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
Substituting \(x = 0.2\) and \(y = 0.98\):
\[
(0.2)^2 + (0.98)^2 = 0.04 + 0.9604 = 1
\]
This confirms that the point lies on the unit circle.

The tangent of the angle \(\theta\) is given by:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{0.98}{0.2} = 4.9
\]

---

### Step 2: Evaluate \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\)
Since \((0.2, 0.98)\) is on the unit circle, we have:
\[
\cos(\theta) = x = 0.2
\]
\[
\sin(\theta) = y = 0.98
\]

---

### Step 3: Evaluate \(\sec(\theta)\)
The secant of \(\theta\) is defined as:
\[
\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{\cos(\theta)}
\]
Substituting \(\cos(\theta) = 0.2\):
\[
\sec(\theta) = \frac{1}{0.2} = 5
\]

---

### Step 4: Evaluate \(\csc(\theta)\)
The cosecant of \(\theta\) is defined as:
\[
\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sin(\theta)}
\]
Substituting \(\sin(\theta) = 0.98\):
\[
\csc(\theta) = \frac{1}{0.98} \approx 1.0204
\]

---

### Step 5: Evaluate \(\cot(\theta)\)
The cotangent of \(\theta\) is defined as:
\[
\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)}
\]
Given \(\tan(\theta) = 4.9\):
\[
\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{4.9} \approx 0.2041
\]

---

### Final Answer:
The expressions evaluated to the nearest hundredth are:
\[
\sec(\theta) = 5
\]
\[
\csc(\theta) \approx 1.02
\]
\[
\cot(\theta) \approx 0.20
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{5, 1.02, 0.20}\]
