QUESTION:
The line goes through the origin. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a number plane with a dashed line passing through the origin (0, 0). The dashed line appears to be a diagonal line, suggesting it could represent a linear equation of the form \( y = mx \), where \( m \) is the slope. The shaded region is below the dashed line, indicating that the inequality describing this region will involve the line's equation.

#### Step 1: Identify the Line's Equation
The dashed line passes through the origin and has a negative slope. By examining the grid, we can determine the slope:
- The line passes through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((-5, 10)\).
- The slope \( m \) is calculated as:
  \[
  m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{10 - 0}{-5 - 0} = \frac{10}{-5} = -2
  \]
Thus, the equation of the line is:
\[
y = -2x
\]

#### Step 2: Determine the Inequality
The shaded region is below the line \( y = -2x \). This means that for any point \((x, y)\) in the shaded region, the value of \( y \) is less than the value of \( -2x \). Therefore, the inequality describing the shaded region is:
\[
y < -2x
\]

#### Step 3: Verify the Inequality
To confirm, consider a test point in the shaded region. For example, the point \((-3, -7)\) lies in the shaded region. Substituting \((-3, -7)\) into the inequality \( y < -2x \):
\[
-7 < -2(-3) \implies -7 < 6
\]
This is true, confirming that the inequality \( y < -2x \) correctly describes the shaded region.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y < -2x}
\]
