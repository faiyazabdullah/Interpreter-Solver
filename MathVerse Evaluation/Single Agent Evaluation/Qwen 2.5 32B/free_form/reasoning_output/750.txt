QUESTION:
Consider the following figure. The base is a triangle with two side of the same length 10cm and one side of length 12cm. The height of the prism is 16cm.

Use Pythagoras' Theorem to find the unknown height $x$ in the triangular prism shown.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given figure is a triangular prism. The base of the prism is an isosceles triangle with two equal sides of 10 cm each and a base of 12 cm. The height of the prism is 16 cm. We need to find the unknown height \( x \) of the triangular base, which is the perpendicular distance from the apex of the triangle to its base.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The base of the triangle is 12 cm.
- The two equal sides of the triangle are each 10 cm.
- The height of the prism is 16 cm (not needed for finding \( x \)).

#### Step 2: Understand the problem
We need to find the height \( x \) of the isosceles triangle. This height will split the base into two equal segments of 6 cm each, forming two right triangles.

#### Step 3: Apply Pythagoras' Theorem
In the right triangle formed by the height \( x \), half of the base (6 cm), and one of the equal sides (10 cm), we can use Pythagoras' Theorem:
\[
\text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \text{Base}^2 + \text{Height}^2
\]
Here:
- The hypotenuse is 10 cm (one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle).
- The base is 6 cm (half of the 12 cm base).
- The height is \( x \).

Substitute these values into Pythagoras' Theorem:
\[
10^2 = 6^2 + x^2
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
\[
10^2 = 6^2 + x^2
\]
\[
100 = 36 + x^2
\]
\[
x^2 = 100 - 36
\]
\[
x^2 = 64
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{64}
\]
\[
x = 8
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
