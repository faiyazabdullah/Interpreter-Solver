QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, the hypotenuse measures 8\sqrt{5}. Consider the adjacent figure:Find the exact value of y.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's carefully analyze the given information and apply relevant geometric principles step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The triangle is a right-angled triangle.
- One of the acute angles is \(60^\circ\).
- The hypotenuse is \(8\sqrt{5}\).
- We need to find the length of the side labeled \(y\), which is adjacent to the \(60^\circ\) angle.

### Step 2: Understand the relationships in the triangle
Since the triangle is a right-angled triangle with one angle measuring \(60^\circ\), the other acute angle must be \(30^\circ\) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\)). This means we have a \(30^\circ\)-\(60^\circ\)-\(90^\circ\) triangle.

In a \(30^\circ\)-\(60^\circ\)-\(90^\circ\) triangle:
- The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is half the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.
- The hypotenuse is the longest side.

### Step 3: Assign variables and use the hypotenuse
Let the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle be \(x\). Then:
- The hypotenuse is \(2x\).
- The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle is \(x\sqrt{3}\).

We are given that the hypotenuse is \(8\sqrt{5}\). Therefore:
\[
2x = 8\sqrt{5}
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{8\sqrt{5}}{2} = 4\sqrt{5}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the length of the side labeled \(y\)
The side labeled \(y\) is the side adjacent to the \(60^\circ\) angle, which is the same as the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle. From our earlier calculation, this side is \(x\):
\[
y = x = 4\sqrt{5}
\]

### Step 5: Verify the solution
We can verify by checking the side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle, which should be \(x\sqrt{3}\):
\[
x\sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{15}
\]
This matches the properties of a \(30^\circ\)-\(60^\circ\)-\(90^\circ\) triangle.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4\sqrt{5}}
\]
