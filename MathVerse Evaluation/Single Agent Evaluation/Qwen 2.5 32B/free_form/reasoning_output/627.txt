QUESTION:
Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is greater than 0. It intersects the x-axis and the y-axis at (0,-4). Consider the graph of $y=x-4$.

State the coordinates of the $x$-intercept in the form $(a, b)$.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given equation of the line is \( y = x - 4 \). This is a linear function with a slope of 1 and a y-intercept at \( (0, -4) \). We are tasked with finding the coordinates of the \( x \)-intercept of this line.

#### Step 1: Understanding the \( x \)-intercept
The \( x \)-intercept of a line occurs where the line crosses the \( x \)-axis. At this point, the value of \( y \) is 0. Therefore, to find the \( x \)-intercept, we set \( y = 0 \) in the equation of the line and solve for \( x \).

#### Step 2: Substitute \( y = 0 \) into the equation
The equation of the line is:
\[ y = x - 4 \]
Substitute \( y = 0 \):
\[ 0 = x - 4 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Add 4 to both sides of the equation:
\[ x = 4 \]

#### Step 4: Write the coordinates of the \( x \)-intercept
The \( x \)-intercept occurs at the point where \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 0 \). Therefore, the coordinates of the \( x \)-intercept are:
\[ (4, 0) \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(4, 0)}
\]
