QUESTION:
In the figure above, triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 37° and angle B is 48°. Find the true bearing of point A from point B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the **true bearing** of point \( A \) from point \( B \). The given information includes:
- Triangle \( ABC \) with \( \angle A = 37^\circ \) and \( \angle B = 48^\circ \).
- The true bearing involves determining the direction from \( B \) to \( A \) relative to the cardinal directions (north).

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup
- The dashed lines form triangle \( ABC \).
- The angles at points \( A \) and \( B \) are given as \( 37^\circ \) and \( 48^\circ \), respectively.
- The third angle, \( \angle C \), can be calculated using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle C = 180^\circ - \angle A - \angle B = 180^\circ - 37^\circ - 48^\circ = 95^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2: Determine the Direction from \( B \) to \( A \)
- True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.
- The figure shows that point \( A \) is located to the left of the dashed line extending from \( B \). This indicates that the direction from \( B \) to \( A \) is **westward** relative to the north-south axis at \( B \).
- The angle between the north direction at \( B \) and the line \( BA \) is \( 180^\circ - 48^\circ = 132^\circ \) (since \( 48^\circ \) is the angle between the horizontal and the line \( BC \)).

#### Step 3: Calculate the True Bearing
- The true bearing of \( A \) from \( B \) is the angle measured clockwise from north at \( B \) to the line \( BA \).
- Since \( \angle B = 48^\circ \) is the angle between the horizontal and \( BC \), the angle between north and \( BA \) is:
  \[
  180^\circ - 48^\circ = 132^\circ.
  \]

### Final Answer:
The true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( B \) is \( 132^\circ \).

\[
\boxed{132^\circ}
\]
