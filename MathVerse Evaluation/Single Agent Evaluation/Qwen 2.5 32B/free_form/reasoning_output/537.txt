QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The given problem involves analyzing a trigonometric function's graph to determine its period. The key points provided are:
- Maximum point: $\left(\frac{1}{4}\pi, -2.2\right)$
- Minimum point: $\left(\frac{3}{4}\pi, -8.5\right)$

From these points, we can deduce the following:
1. The horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum points corresponds to half the period of the trigonometric function. This is because the maximum and minimum points are separated by half the cycle of the wave.
2. The period of a trigonometric function is the horizontal distance over which the function completes one full cycle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the Horizontal Distance Between the Maximum and Minimum Points
The maximum point is at $x = \frac{1}{4}\pi$, and the minimum point is at $x = \frac{3}{4}\pi$. The horizontal distance between these two points is:
\[
\text{Horizontal distance} = \frac{3}{4}\pi - \frac{1}{4}\pi = \frac{2}{4}\pi = \frac{1}{2}\pi
\]

#### Step 2: Relate the Horizontal Distance to the Period
In a trigonometric function, the distance between a maximum and a minimum point is exactly half the period. Let the period of the function be denoted as $T$. Then:
\[
\text{Half the period} = \frac{T}{2}
\]
From the previous calculation, we know that:
\[
\frac{T}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\pi
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for the Period $T$
To find the full period $T$, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
T = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}\pi = \pi
\]

### Final Answer:
The period of the function is $\pi$.

\[
\boxed{\pi}
\]
