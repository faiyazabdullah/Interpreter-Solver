QUESTION:
The perimeter is equal to the sum of the four side lengths of the trapezium. Find the length of the missing side of the trapezium shown.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image depicts a trapezium. The key features identified are:
1. One pair of parallel sides (bases).
2. One non-parallel side (leg) labeled as \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
3. A perpendicular height from one vertex of the shorter base to the longer base, labeled as \(6 \, \text{cm}\).

The task is to find the length of the missing side (the other leg of the trapezium). To solve this, we need to use geometric principles and relationships.

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Identify Given Information:
- The height of the trapezium (\(h\)) is \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
- One leg of the trapezium is \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
- The bases are not directly given, but we can infer their relationship using the right triangle formed by the height and the legs.

#### 2. Analyze the Right Triangle:
The height creates a right triangle with one leg of the trapezium and a segment of the longer base. Let us denote:
- The shorter base as \(b_1\).
- The longer base as \(b_2\).
- The segment of the longer base adjacent to the right triangle as \(x\).

From the right triangle:
- The hypotenuse is the known leg of the trapezium, which is \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
- The height of the trapezium is one leg of the right triangle, which is \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
- The other leg of the right triangle is \(x\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
x^2 + h^2 = \text{hypotenuse}^2
\]
Substitute \(h = 6 \, \text{cm}\) and the hypotenuse \(= 10 \, \text{cm}\):
\[
x^2 + 6^2 = 10^2
\]
\[
x^2 + 36 = 100
\]
\[
x^2 = 64
\]
\[
x = 8 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### 3. Determine the Missing Side:
The missing side is the other leg of the trapezium. Since the trapezium is symmetric in this context (no additional information suggests asymmetry), the other leg will also form a similar right triangle with the same height (\(6 \, \text{cm}\)) and the same horizontal segment (\(x = 8 \, \text{cm}\)).

Using the Pythagorean theorem again for the second right triangle:
\[
\text{Missing side}^2 = x^2 + h^2
\]
\[
\text{Missing side}^2 = 8^2 + 6^2
\]
\[
\text{Missing side}^2 = 64 + 36
\]
\[
\text{Missing side}^2 = 100
\]
\[
\text{Missing side} = 10 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### 4. Verify the Perimeter:
The perimeter of the trapezium is the sum of all its sides. However, since the bases are not explicitly given and the question only asks for the missing side, we focus on the missing leg.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{10 \, \text{cm}}
\]
