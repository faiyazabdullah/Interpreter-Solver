### Problem Analysis:
We are given a quadratic function that opens upwards and is symmetric with respect to \( x = 2 \). The vertex of the parabola is at the point \( (2, -2) \). Our task is to determine the intervals on which the function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The quadratic function opens upwards, so its general form is \( f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex.
- The vertex is given as \( (2, -2) \). Thus, \( h = 2 \) and \( k = -2 \).
- Since the function opens upwards, \( a > 0 \).

#### Step 2: Write the equation of the quadratic function
Using the vertex form of a quadratic function:
\[
f(x) = a(x - 2)^2 - 2
\]
Since the function opens upwards, \( a > 0 \). However, the exact value of \( a \) is not needed to determine the intervals of increase and decrease.

#### Step 3: Analyze the symmetry and behavior of the quadratic function
- The axis of symmetry is \( x = 2 \).
- For a quadratic function that opens upwards:
  - The function is decreasing on the interval \( (-\infty, 2) \) (to the left of the vertex).
  - The function is increasing on the interval \( (2, \infty) \) (to the right of the vertex).
  - At the vertex \( x = 2 \), the function is neither increasing nor decreasing; it is constant (but only at the single point).

#### Step 4: Determine the intervals
- **Decreasing interval**: The function decreases from \( -\infty \) to the vertex \( x = 2 \). Thus, the interval is \( (-\infty, 2) \).
- **Increasing interval**: The function increases from the vertex \( x = 2 \) to \( \infty \). Thus, the interval is \( (2, \infty) \).
- **Constant interval**: The function is constant only at the vertex \( x = 2 \). This is a single point, not an interval.

#### Step 5: Combine the results
- Decreasing: \( (-\infty, 2) \)
- Increasing: \( (2, \infty) \)
- Constant: None (except at the single point \( x = 2 \), which is not an interval)

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Decreasing on } (-\infty, 2), \text{ Increasing on } (2, \infty)}
\]
