====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) on a Cartesian coordinate plane. The radius of the circle is given as 7. The task is to determine the equation of the circle.

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- **Center of the Circle**: The center is at the origin, \((h, k) = (0, 0)\).
- **Radius of the Circle**: \(r = 7\).

#### Step 2: Understand the Goal
We need to find the equation of the circle. The general form of the equation of a circle is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]
where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \(r\) is the radius.

#### Step 3: Substitute Known Values
Since the center is at \((0, 0)\) and the radius is 7, we substitute \(h = 0\), \(k = 0\), and \(r = 7\) into the general equation:
\[
(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 7^2
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 49
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Equation
The equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 49\) represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 7. This matches the given information in the problem.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 49}
\]
