QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, the hypotenuse measures 9. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown a.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given right-angled triangle has the following characteristics:
- One of the acute angles is \(60^\circ\).
- The hypotenuse is \(9\).
- We need to find the length of the side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle, denoted as \(a\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the relationships in the triangle
In a right-angled triangle, the sides are related to the angles via trigonometric ratios. Specifically:
- The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
- The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse.
- The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the adjacent side.

Here, we are given:
- Hypotenuse (\(c\)) = \(9\).
- One of the acute angles (\(\theta\)) = \(60^\circ\).

We need to find the length of the side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle, which we denote as \(a\).

#### Step 2: Use the sine function
The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
For \(\theta = 60^\circ\):
\[
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{a}{9}
\]
We know from trigonometry that:
\[
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Substituting this value into the equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{a}{9}
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(a\)
To isolate \(a\), multiply both sides of the equation by \(9\):
\[
a = 9 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
a = \frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the solution
The side \(a\) is the length of the side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle, and our calculation uses the sine function correctly. The result is consistent with the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle, where the side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) times the hypotenuse.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{9\sqrt{3}}{2}}
\]
