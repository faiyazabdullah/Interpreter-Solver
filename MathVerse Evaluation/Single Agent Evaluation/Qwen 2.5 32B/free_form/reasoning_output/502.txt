QUESTION:
There is a cubic function that passes (0,0). Find the absolute maximum of the function.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given image is a graph of a cubic function. The task is to find the **absolute maximum** of the function. Here's how we will proceed:

#### Step 1: Examine the Graph
- The graph shows a cubic function with a clear peak and trough.
- The function passes through the origin, as indicated by the point \((0, 0)\).
- The function has a local maximum at approximately \(x = -2\) and a local minimum at approximately \(x = 3\).

#### Step 2: Identify Key Features
- The **absolute maximum** is the highest point on the graph. From the image, it appears to occur near \(x = -2\).
- The y-coordinate of this point can be estimated from the grid. The highest point on the graph is approximately at \((-2, 10)\).

#### Step 3: Confirm the Absolute Maximum
- The function is a cubic polynomial, which can have at most two turning points (one local maximum and one local minimum). The graph confirms this behavior.
- Since there are no higher points on the graph beyond the visible range, the local maximum at \(x = -2\) is also the **absolute maximum**.

#### Step 4: Determine the Value of the Absolute Maximum
- The y-coordinate of the absolute maximum is approximately 10.

### Final Answer:
The absolute maximum of the function is the y-coordinate of the highest point on the graph, which is 10.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{10}\]
