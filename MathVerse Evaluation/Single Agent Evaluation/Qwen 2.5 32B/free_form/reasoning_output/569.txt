QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of the function \( g(x) \), which is a translated (shifted) version of the parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \). The graph shows both \( f(x) \) in blue and \( g(x) \) in red. By analyzing the shifts in the graph, we can determine the translation applied to \( f(x) \).

#### Step 1: Examine the Original Function \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) = x^2 \) is a standard parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex at the origin \((0, 0)\).

#### Step 2: Identify the Vertex of \( g(x) \)
From the graph, we observe that the red parabola \( g(x) \) is a shifted version of \( f(x) \). The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at the point \((-2, -1)\). This indicates that \( g(x) \) is obtained by translating \( f(x) \) horizontally and vertically.

#### Step 3: Determine the Horizontal Translation
The vertex of \( f(x) \) is at \((0, 0)\), and the vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \((-2, -1)\). The horizontal shift is determined by comparing the \( x \)-coordinates of the vertices:
- The vertex of \( f(x) \) moves from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = -2 \).
- This indicates a horizontal shift of 2 units to the left.

Mathematically, a horizontal shift to the left by 2 units is represented by replacing \( x \) with \( x + 2 \) in the function \( f(x) \). Thus, the function becomes:
\[ f(x + 2) = (x + 2)^2. \]

#### Step 4: Determine the Vertical Translation
Next, we consider the vertical shift. The vertex of \( f(x) \) is at \( y = 0 \), and the vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \( y = -1 \). The vertical shift is determined by comparing the \( y \)-coordinates of the vertices:
- The vertex of \( f(x) \) moves from \( y = 0 \) to \( y = -1 \).
- This indicates a vertical shift of 1 unit downward.

Mathematically, a vertical shift downward by 1 unit is represented by subtracting 1 from the function. Thus, the function becomes:
\[ f(x + 2) - 1 = (x + 2)^2 - 1. \]

#### Step 5: Write the Equation for \( g(x) \)
Combining the horizontal and vertical translations, the equation for \( g(x) \) is:
\[ g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 1. \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 1}
\]
