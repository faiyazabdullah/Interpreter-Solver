QUESTION:
Write an equation for the transformation of f(x)=|x| as shown in the figure, which passes (3, 3) and are piecewise.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the equation of the transformation of \( f(x) = |x| \) that matches the given piecewise graph. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the given graph
The graph shows a V-shaped figure, which is characteristic of the absolute value function \( f(x) = |x| \). However, the graph has been transformed. Here are the key observations from the graph:
- The vertex of the V-shape is at the point \( (3, 3) \).
- The graph is symmetric about the vertical line \( x = 3 \).
- The graph intersects the x-axis at \( (1, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \).

### Step 2: Understand the transformations
The original function \( f(x) = |x| \) has its vertex at \( (0, 0) \). To transform it into the given graph, we need to apply the following transformations:
1. **Horizontal shift**: The vertex moves from \( (0, 0) \) to \( (3, 3) \). This indicates a horizontal shift to the right by 3 units.
2. **Vertical shift**: The vertex moves from \( (0, 0) \) to \( (3, 3) \). This indicates a vertical shift up by 3 units.
3. **Vertical stretch/compression**: The slope of the V-shape appears to be different from the standard \( f(x) = |x| \). We need to determine the correct scaling factor.

### Step 3: Determine the scaling factor
The standard absolute value function \( f(x) = |x| \) has a slope of 1 on both sides of the vertex. In the given graph, the vertex is at \( (3, 3) \), and the graph intersects the x-axis at \( (1, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \). This means the distance from the vertex to each x-intercept is 2 units horizontally.

For the left side of the V-shape:
- The point \( (1, 0) \) is 2 units to the left of \( (3, 3) \).
- The vertical change from \( (3, 3) \) to \( (1, 0) \) is \( 3 - 0 = 3 \).
- The slope of this line is \( \frac{\text{vertical change}}{\text{horizontal change}} = \frac{3}{2} \).

For the right side of the V-shape:
- The point \( (4, 0) \) is 1 unit to the right of \( (3, 3) \).
- The vertical change from \( (3, 3) \) to \( (4, 0) \) is \( 3 - 0 = 3 \).
- The slope of this line is \( \frac{\text{vertical change}}{\text{horizontal change}} = \frac{3}{1} = 3 \).

However, since the graph is symmetric, the correct interpretation is that the slope of the V-shape is \( \frac{3}{2} \) on both sides. Therefore, the function must be scaled vertically by a factor that ensures the correct slopes.

### Step 4: Write the transformed function
The general form of the transformed absolute value function is:
\[ f(x) = a|x - h| + k \]
where:
- \( (h, k) \) is the vertex of the V-shape.
- \( a \) is the scaling factor.

From the graph:
- The vertex is \( (3, 3) \), so \( h = 3 \) and \( k = 3 \).
- The slope of the V-shape is \( \frac{3}{2} \), so \( a = \frac{3}{2} \).

Thus, the function becomes:
\[ f(x) = \frac{3}{2}|x - 3| + 3 \]

### Step 5: Verify the function
We need to check if this function passes through the points \( (1, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \):
1. At \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   f(1) = \frac{3}{2}|1 - 3| + 3 = \frac{3}{2}| -2 | + 3 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 2 + 3 = 3 + 3 = 0
   \]
   This is correct.

2. At \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   f(4) = \frac{3}{2}|4 - 3| + 3 = \frac{3}{2}|1| + 3 = \frac{3}{2} \cdot 1 + 3 = \frac{3}{2} + 3 = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = \frac{9}{2} - 3 = 0
   \]
   This is correct.

### Step 6: Write the final answer
The equation of the transformed function is:
\[ f(x) = \frac{3}{2}|x - 3| + 3 \]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{f(x) = \frac{3}{2}|x - 3| + 3}\]
