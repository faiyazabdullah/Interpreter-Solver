QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, shown below.

Complete the statement.

Every point on the circle is exactly _ units away from the point

( _ , _ ).

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) of a Cartesian coordinate system. The circle intersects the axes at four points. The goal is to determine the radius of the circle and identify the center, so we can complete the statement: "Every point on the circle is exactly _ units away from the point ( _, _ )."

#### Step 1: Identify Key Information
1. **Center of the Circle**: The circle appears to be centered at the origin \((0, 0)\).
2. **Intersection Points**: The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis at points that are symmetric about the origin. From the graph, these points appear to be:
   - On the \(x\)-axis: \((5, 0)\) and \((-5, 0)\).
   - On the \(y\)-axis: \((0, 5)\) and \((0, -5)\).

#### Step 2: Determine the Radius
The radius of a circle is the distance from its center to any point on the circle. Using the intersection points:
- The distance from the center \((0, 0)\) to \((5, 0)\) is:
  \[
  r = \sqrt{(5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{5^2} = 5.
  \]
- Similarly, the distance from the center \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 5)\) is also:
  \[
  r = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (5 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{5^2} = 5.
  \]

Thus, the radius of the circle is \(5\) units.

#### Step 3: Complete the Statement
The statement asks us to fill in the blanks: "Every point on the circle is exactly _ units away from the point ( _, _ )."
- The distance from every point on the circle to its center is the radius, which we have determined to be \(5\) units.
- The center of the circle is \((0, 0)\).

Therefore, the completed statement is:
"Every point on the circle is exactly \(5\) units away from the point \((0, 0)\)."

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{5 \text{ units away from the point } (0, 0)}
\]
