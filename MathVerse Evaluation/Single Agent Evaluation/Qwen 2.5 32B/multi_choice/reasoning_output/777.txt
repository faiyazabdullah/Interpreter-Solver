### Problem Analysis:
We are given a circle with center \( O \). Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the circumference of the circle. The angle \( \angle AOB \) (denoted as \( x^\circ \)) is given as \( 80^\circ \). We need to find the value of \( z \), which represents the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - \( x = 80^\circ \): This is the central angle \( \angle AOB \).
   - \( z \) is the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \).

#### 2. **Understand the Relationship Between Central and Inscribed Angles:**
   - A key property of circles is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - Mathematically, if \( \angle AOB \) is the central angle subtending arc \( AB \), then the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) (which also subtends arc \( AB \)) is given by:
     \[
     z = \frac{1}{2} \times x
     \]

#### 3. **Substitute the Given Value:**
   - We are given \( x = 80^\circ \).
   - Using the relationship \( z = \frac{1}{2} \times x \):
     \[
     z = \frac{1}{2} \times 80^\circ = 40^\circ
     \]

#### 4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - The central angle \( \angle AOB \) is \( 80^\circ \).
   - The inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) is half of the central angle, so \( z = 40^\circ \).
   - This aligns with the geometric property of circles.

#### 5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( z \) is \( 40^\circ \).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A. 80
     - B. 60
     - C. 50
     - D. 40
     - E. 10
   - The correct choice is \( D \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
