To solve the problem, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The triangle is **isosceles**, meaning two sides are equal.
- The base of the triangle is given as **3.5 ft**.
- One of the base angles is **48°**.
- We need to find the perimeter of the triangle, which requires knowing the lengths of all three sides.

### Step 2: Understand the geometric relationships
In an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are opposite the equal angles. Since one base angle is 48°, the other base angle is also 48°. The vertex angle (the angle opposite the base) can be found using the fact that the sum of the interior angles in a triangle is 180°:
\[
\text{Vertex angle} = 180° - 48° - 48° = 84°.
\]

### Step 3: Identify what needs to be found
We need to find the lengths of the two equal sides of the isosceles triangle. Once we have these lengths, we can calculate the perimeter:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = \text{Base} + 2 \times (\text{Length of each equal side}).
\]

### Step 4: Use trigonometry to find the length of the equal sides
Let the length of each equal side be \( x \). We can use the Law of Sines to relate the sides and angles of the triangle. The Law of Sines states:
\[
\frac{\text{Side}}{\sin(\text{Opposite angle})} = \frac{\text{Another side}}{\sin(\text{Another opposite angle})}.
\]
Applying this to our triangle:
\[
\frac{x}{\sin(48°)} = \frac{3.5}{\sin(84°)}.
\]
Solving for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{3.5 \cdot \sin(48°)}{\sin(84°)}.
\]

### Step 5: Perform the calculations
First, compute the values of the sine functions:
\[
\sin(48°) \approx 0.7431, \quad \sin(84°) \approx 0.9945.
\]
Substitute these values into the equation:
\[
x = \frac{3.5 \cdot 0.7431}{0.9945} \approx \frac{2.60085}{0.9945} \approx 2.615.
\]
So, the length of each equal side is approximately 2.615 ft.

### Step 6: Calculate the perimeter
The perimeter \( P \) of the triangle is:
\[
P = \text{Base} + 2 \times (\text{Length of each equal side}) = 3.5 + 2 \times 2.615 = 3.5 + 5.23 = 8.73.
\]

### Step 7: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated perimeter is 8.73, which matches option D.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
