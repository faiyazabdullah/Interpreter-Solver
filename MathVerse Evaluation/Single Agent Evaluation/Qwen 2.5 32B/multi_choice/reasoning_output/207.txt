### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the given information**
- The diameter of the largest circle is 20.
- Two smaller circles are inscribed within the largest circle such that they are tangent to each other and to the largest circle.
- We need to find the area of the shaded region, which is the area of the largest circle minus the areas of the two smaller circles.

#### **Step 2: Calculate the radius of the largest circle**
The diameter of the largest circle is 20, so its radius \( R \) is:
\[
R = \frac{\text{diameter}}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

#### **Step 3: Determine the radius of the smaller circles**
Since the two smaller circles are inscribed and tangent to each other and the largest circle, their combined diameter equals the diameter of the largest circle. Therefore, the diameter of each smaller circle is half the diameter of the largest circle:
\[
\text{Diameter of each smaller circle} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]
Thus, the radius \( r \) of each smaller circle is:
\[
r = \frac{\text{diameter of smaller circle}}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the area of the largest circle**
The area \( A_{\text{large}} \) of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
A_{\text{large}} = \pi R^2
\]
Substituting \( R = 10 \):
\[
A_{\text{large}} = \pi (10)^2 = 100\pi
\]

#### **Step 5: Calculate the area of one smaller circle**
The area \( A_{\text{small}} \) of a smaller circle is given by:
\[
A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 5 \):
\[
A_{\text{small}} = \pi (5)^2 = 25\pi
\]

Since there are two smaller circles, the total area of the two smaller circles is:
\[
A_{\text{two small}} = 2 \times 25\pi = 50\pi
\]

#### **Step 6: Calculate the area of the shaded region**
The shaded region is the area of the largest circle minus the combined area of the two smaller circles:
\[
A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{large}} - A_{\text{two small}} = 100\pi - 50\pi = 50\pi
\]

#### **Step 7: Approximate the value of the shaded area**
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
A_{\text{shaded}} = 50\pi \approx 50 \times 3.14159 = 157.0795
\]
Rounding to the nearest tenth:
\[
A_{\text{shaded}} \approx 157.1
\]

#### **Step 8: Match the result with the answer choices**
The calculated area of the shaded region is approximately 157.1, which corresponds to answer choice B.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
