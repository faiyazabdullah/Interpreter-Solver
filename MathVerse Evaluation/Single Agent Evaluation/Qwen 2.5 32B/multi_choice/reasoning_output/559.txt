### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure**
The image shows a graph of a piecewise function \( g(x) \). Key observations from the graph:
- The function \( g(x) \) has distinct segments.
- The segment from \((-5, 0)\) to \((-2, 9)\) is part of the graph.
- The segment from \((-2, 9)\) to \((4, -4)\) is also part of the graph.
- The graph shows that the function reaches its maximum value at \( y = 9 \) and its minimum value at \( y = -4 \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships**
From the graph:
- The highest point on the graph is \( (x, y) = (-2, 9) \), so the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 9.
- The lowest point on the graph is \( (x, y) = (4, -4) \), so the minimum value of \( g(x) \) is -4.
- The function \( g(x) \) takes on values between these extremes, including points like \( (x, y) = (-5, 0) \) and other intermediate values.

#### **Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
We need to determine the **range** of the function \( g(x) \). The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (\( g(x) \)-values) that the function can take.

#### **Step 4: Apply Relevant Concepts**
The range of a function is determined by identifying the minimum and maximum values of the function and all values in between. From the graph:
- The minimum value of \( g(x) \) is \(-4\).
- The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is \(9\).
- Since the function is continuous within the visible domain, it takes on all values between \(-4\) and \(9\).

Thus, the range of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
-4 \leq g(x) \leq 9
\]

#### **Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
Now, let's compare this result with the given answer choices:
- **Choice A**: \(-4 \leq g(x) \leq 9\)
- **Choice B**: The \( g(x) \)-values \(-5, -2, 1, 3, 4\)
- **Choice C**: The \( g(x) \)-values \(-4, 0, 9\)
- **Choice D**: \(-5 \leq g(x) \leq 4\)

- **Choice A** correctly states the range as \(-4 \leq g(x) \leq 9\).
- **Choice B** lists specific values but does not represent the entire range.
- **Choice C** lists specific values but does not represent the entire range.
- **Choice D** incorrectly states the range as \(-5 \leq g(x) \leq 4\), which is narrower than the actual range.

#### **Step 6: Final Answer**
The correct range of \( g(x) \) is \(-4 \leq g(x) \leq 9\).

Final Answer: A
