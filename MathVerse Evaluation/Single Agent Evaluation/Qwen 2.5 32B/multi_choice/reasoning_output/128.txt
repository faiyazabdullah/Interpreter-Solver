### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the diameter of the base of a cone formed by folding a sector into a cone. The given information includes:
- Central angle of the sector: \(120^\circ\)
- Radius of the sector: \(6\) cm

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
When the sector is folded into a cone:
1. The **arc length of the sector** becomes the **circumference of the base of the cone**.
2. The **radius of the sector** becomes the **slant height of the cone**.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Arc Length of the Sector
The arc length \(L\) of a sector with a central angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) and radius \(r\) is given by:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
\]
Here:
- \(\theta = 120^\circ\)
- \(r = 6\) cm

Substitute the values:
\[
L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 6 = \frac{1}{3} \times 2\pi \times 6 = 4\pi \text{ cm}
\]

#### Step 3: Relate the Arc Length to the Cone's Base Circumference
The arc length \(L\) of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let the radius of the base of the cone be \(R\). The circumference of the base is given by:
\[
2\pi R = L
\]
From the previous calculation, \(L = 4\pi\). Therefore:
\[
2\pi R = 4\pi
\]
Solve for \(R\):
\[
R = \frac{4\pi}{2\pi} = 2 \text{ cm}
\]

#### Step 4: Determine the Diameter of the Base
The diameter \(D\) of the base is twice the radius:
\[
D = 2R = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ cm}
\]

#### Step 5: Match the Answer with the Choices
The diameter of the base of the cone is \(4\) cm. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \(2\) cm
- B: \(4\) cm
- C: \(3\) cm
- D: \(5\) cm

The correct answer is \(B\).

### Final Answer:
