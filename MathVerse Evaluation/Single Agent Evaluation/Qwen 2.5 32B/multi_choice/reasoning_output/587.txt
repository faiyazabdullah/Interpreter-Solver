QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (-1,0), (0,8), (2,0), (4,0), have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given graph step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Graph
The graph is a continuous curve passing through specific points:  
- (-1, 0)  
- (0, 8)  
- (2, 0)  
- (4, 0)

### Step 2: Horizontal Line Test for Inverse Functions
For a function to have an inverse, it must pass the **horizontal line test**. This means that no horizontal line can intersect the graph at more than one point. If a horizontal line intersects the graph at more than one point, the function is not one-to-one, and thus does not have an inverse.

### Step 3: Examine the Graph for the Horizontal Line Test
From the graph:
- At \( y = 0 \), the horizontal line intersects the graph at three points: (-1, 0), (2, 0), and (4, 0).
- At other values of \( y \), such as \( y = 8 \), the horizontal line intersects the graph at only one point.

Since there exists at least one horizontal line (e.g., \( y = 0 \)) that intersects the graph at more than one point, the function fails the horizontal line test.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Because the function fails the horizontal line test, it is not one-to-one, and therefore it does not have an inverse function.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
