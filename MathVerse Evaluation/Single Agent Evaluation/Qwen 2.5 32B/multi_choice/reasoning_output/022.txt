### Problem Analysis:
We are given a rhombus \(ABCD\) with the following details:
- \(M\) and \(N\) are points on sides \(AB\) and \(CD\) respectively, such that \(AM = CN\).
- Line segment \(MN\) intersects diagonal \(AC\) at point \(O\).
- We are tasked with finding the measure of \(\angle OBC\), given that \(\angle DAC = 28^\circ\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Properties of the Rhombus**
A rhombus has the following key properties:
1. All sides are equal: \(AB = BC = CD = DA\).
2. Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.
3. Diagonals bisect the vertex angles.

Since \(AC\) is a diagonal of the rhombus, it bisects \(\angle DAB\) and \(\angle BCD\). Therefore:
\[ \angle DAB = 2 \times \angle DAC = 2 \times 28^\circ = 56^\circ. \]

#### **Step 2: Symmetry and Equal Segments**
Given \(AM = CN\), and since \(AB = CD\) (sides of the rhombus), the segments \(MB\) and \(DN\) are also equal:
\[ MB = DN. \]

This symmetry implies that \(MN\) is parallel to \(AD\) and \(BC\) because \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(AB\) and \(CD\) proportionally. Thus, \(MN \parallel AD \parallel BC\).

#### **Step 3: Use of Parallel Lines and Transversals**
Since \(MN \parallel BC\) and \(AC\) is a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. Specifically:
\[ \angle OBC = \angle MOA. \]

#### **Step 4: Determine \(\angle MOA\)** 
In the rhombus, diagonal \(AC\) bisects \(\angle DAB\) into two equal parts:
\[ \angle DAC = 28^\circ. \]
Thus, \(\angle BAC = 28^\circ\) as well.

Since \(MN \parallel AD\), \(\angle MOA\) is equal to \(\angle DAC\) (alternate interior angles):
\[ \angle MOA = \angle DAC = 28^\circ. \]

#### **Step 5: Relate \(\angle OBC\) to \(\angle MOA\)** 
From the parallelism \(MN \parallel BC\), we have:
\[ \angle OBC = \angle MOA = 28^\circ. \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \(\angle OBC\) is \(28^\circ\).
