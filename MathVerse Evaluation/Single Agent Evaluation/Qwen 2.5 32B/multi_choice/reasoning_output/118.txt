### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a cone whose lateral surface, when expanded, forms a semicircle with a radius of 10. We need to determine the radius of the base of the cone.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The expanded lateral surface of the cone is a **semicircle**.
- The radius of the semicircle is **10**.
- The circumference of the semicircle's arc is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.

#### Step 2: Key geometric relationships
1. **Circumference of the semicircle's arc**: The arc length of the semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle with radius 10. The formula for the circumference of a full circle is \(2\pi r\), so the arc length of the semicircle is:
   \[
   \text{Arc length} = \pi \times \text{radius} = \pi \times 10 = 10\pi
   \]
2. **Circumference of the base of the cone**: The arc length of the semicircle corresponds to the circumference of the base of the cone. If the radius of the base of the cone is \(r\), then the circumference of the base is:
   \[
   \text{Circumference of the base} = 2\pi r
   \]
3. **Equating the two circumferences**: Since the arc length of the semicircle is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone, we have:
   \[
   10\pi = 2\pi r
   \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \(r\)
Divide both sides of the equation by \(2\pi\):
\[
r = \frac{10\pi}{2\pi} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the solution
- The radius of the base of the cone is \(r = 5\).
- The circumference of the base of the cone is \(2\pi \times 5 = 10\pi\), which matches the arc length of the semicircle.

#### Final Answer:
The radius of the base of the cone is \(5\).
