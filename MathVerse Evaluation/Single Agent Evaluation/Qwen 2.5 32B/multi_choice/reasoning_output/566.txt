### Analysis and Solution:

#### Step 1: Understanding the given information
- **Function \( g(x) \)**:
  - The graph of \( g(x) \) is shown in the image.
  - It is a quadratic function that opens upward.
  - The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \( (3, -8) \).
  - The minimum value of \( g(x) \) is \( -8 \).

- **Function \( f(x) \)**:
  - The explicit form of \( f(x) \) is given as \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 \).

#### Step 2: Determine the \( y \)-intercept of \( g(x) \)
- The \( y \)-intercept of a function occurs at \( x = 0 \). From the graph, we can observe the point where the curve intersects the \( y \)-axis.
- By examining the graph, the \( y \)-intercept of \( g(x) \) appears to be around \( y = -7 \). However, for precision, we can use the vertex form of a quadratic function to confirm this.

The general vertex form of a quadratic function is:
\[
g(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k
\]
where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex. Here, the vertex is \( (3, -8) \), so:
\[
g(x) = a(x - 3)^2 - 8
\]

To find \( a \), we need another point on the graph. From the graph, we can see that \( g(0) \approx -7 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( g(0) = -7 \) into the equation:
\[
-7 = a(0 - 3)^2 - 8
\]
\[
-7 = 9a - 8
\]
\[
9a = 1 \implies a = \frac{1}{9}
\]

Thus, the equation of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
g(x) = \frac{1}{9}(x - 3)^2 - 8
\]

Now, let's verify the \( y \)-intercept by substituting \( x = 0 \):
\[
g(0) = \frac{1}{9}(0 - 3)^2 - 8 = \frac{1}{9}(9) - 8 = 1 - 8 = -7
\]

So, the \( y \)-intercept of \( g(x) \) is \( -7 \).

#### Step 3: Determine the \( y \)-intercept of \( f(x) \)
- The function \( f(x) \) is given explicitly as:
\[
f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1
\]

The \( y \)-intercept occurs at \( x = 0 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into \( f(x) \):
\[
f(0) = 0^2 - 2(0) + 1 = 1
\]

So, the \( y \)-intercept of \( f(x) \) is \( 1 \).

#### Step 4: Compare the \( y \)-intercepts
- The \( y \)-intercept of \( g(x) \) is \( -7 \).
- The \( y \)-intercept of \( f(x) \) is \( 1 \).

Clearly, \( 1 > -7 \), so \( f(x) \) has a greater \( y \)-intercept than \( g(x) \).

#### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
