====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we will analyze the given information step by step and use geometric properties to find the perimeter of the rhombus \( L M P Q \).

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- \( L M P Q \) is a rhombus.
- Diagonals \( P L \) and \( Q M \) intersect at \( R \).
- \( m \angle Q L M = 2x^2 - 10 \)
- \( m \angle Q P M = 8x \)
- \( M P = 10 \)

### Step 2: Properties of a rhombus
1. All sides of a rhombus are equal.
2. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles (90Â°).
3. Each diagonal divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles.

### Step 3: Use the angle properties
Since \( L M P Q \) is a rhombus, the diagonals \( P L \) and \( Q M \) bisect each other at right angles. This means:
- \( \angle Q R L = 90^\circ \)
- \( \angle Q L M \) and \( \angle Q P M \) are related to the internal angles of the rhombus.

#### Key observation:
The angles \( \angle Q L M \) and \( \angle Q P M \) are part of the internal angles of the rhombus. However, the problem does not directly provide a relationship between these angles and the sides. Instead, we need to use the fact that the diagonals bisect each other at right angles and the side length of the rhombus is given as \( M P = 10 \).

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
The problem does not provide a direct way to solve for \( x \) using the angles alone because the angles are not directly related to the side lengths in a straightforward manner. Instead, we can focus on the fact that all sides of the rhombus are equal, and the side length is given as 10.

### Step 5: Calculate the perimeter
Since \( L M P Q \) is a rhombus, all four sides are equal. The side length \( M P = 10 \). Therefore, the perimeter of the rhombus is:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 4 \times \text{side length} = 4 \times 10 = 40
\]

### Step 6: Match the answer with the choices
The perimeter of the rhombus is 40. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 10
- B: 40
- C: 70
- D: 140

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]

### Final Answer: B
