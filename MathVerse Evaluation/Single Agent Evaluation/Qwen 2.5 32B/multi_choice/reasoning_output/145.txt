### Problem Analysis:
We are given a circle with center \( O \) and points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) on the circumference. The angles \( \angle ABO = 40^\circ \) and \( \angle ACO = 30^\circ \) are provided. We need to find the measure of \( \angle BOC \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - Since \( O \) is the center of the circle, \( OA \), \( OB \), and \( OC \) are radii of the circle.
   - Therefore, \( \triangle ABO \) and \( \triangle ACO \) are isosceles triangles because two sides (radii) are equal in each triangle.

2. **Finding \( \angle AOB \):**
   - In \( \triangle ABO \), \( OA = OB \) (both are radii).
   - The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal. Thus, \( \angle OAB = \angle OBA = 40^\circ \).
   - Using the angle sum property of a triangle:
     \[
     \angle AOB + \angle OAB + \angle OBA = 180^\circ
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \angle AOB + 40^\circ + 40^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle AOB = 180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ
     \]

3. **Finding \( \angle AOC \):**
   - In \( \triangle ACO \), \( OA = OC \) (both are radii).
   - The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal. Thus, \( \angle OAC = \angle OCA = 30^\circ \).
   - Using the angle sum property of a triangle:
     \[
     \angle AOC + \angle OAC + \angle OCA = 180^\circ
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \angle AOC + 30^\circ + 30^\circ = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     \angle AOC = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ
     \]

4. **Finding \( \angle BOC \):**
   - The angle \( \angle BOC \) is the central angle subtended by the arc \( BC \).
   - Since \( \angle AOB \) and \( \angle AOC \) are adjacent angles at the center, we can find \( \angle BOC \) by subtracting \( \angle AOB \) from \( \angle AOC \):
     \[
     \angle BOC = \angle AOC - \angle AOB
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \angle BOC = 120^\circ - 100^\circ = 20^\circ
     \]

### Re-evaluating the Problem:
Upon re-evaluation, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation. Let's consider the central angle directly using the fact that the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc. However, the problem setup suggests a simpler approach using the given angles directly.

Given the setup and typical geometric problems of this type, the correct interpretation should be:
- The central angle \( \angle BOC \) is the sum of the angles subtended by the arcs \( AB \) and \( AC \) at the center.

Thus, the correct calculation should be:
\[
\angle BOC = 2 \times (\text{Sum of inscribed angles})
\]
However, the direct approach using the given angles suggests:
\[
\angle BOC = 140^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
