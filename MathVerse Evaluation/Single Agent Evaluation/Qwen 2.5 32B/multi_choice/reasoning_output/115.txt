### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the bottom perimeter of a conical paper cap formed by rolling a sector of a circle into a cone. The given information includes:
- Central angle of the sector: \(120^\circ\)
- Radius of the sector: \(6 \, \text{cm}\)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the relationship between the sector and the cone**
When a sector of a circle is rolled into a cone:
1. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
2. The radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone.

#### **Step 2: Calculate the arc length of the sector**
The arc length \(L\) of a sector with a central angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) and radius \(r\) is given by:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
\]
Here:
- \(\theta = 120^\circ\)
- \(r = 6 \, \text{cm}\)

Substitute the values:
\[
L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 6
\]
\[
L = \frac{1}{3} \times 2\pi \times 6
\]
\[
L = \frac{1}{3} \times 12\pi
\]
\[
L = 4\pi \, \text{cm}
\]

#### **Step 3: Relate the arc length to the base circumference of the cone**
The arc length of the sector, \(4\pi \, \text{cm}\), becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let \(C\) be the circumference of the base of the cone. Then:
\[
C = 4\pi \, \text{cm}
\]

#### **Step 4: Confirm the result**
The bottom perimeter of the paper cap (which is the circumference of the base of the cone) is \(4\pi \, \text{cm}\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
