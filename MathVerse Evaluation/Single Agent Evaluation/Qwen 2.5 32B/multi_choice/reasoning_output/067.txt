### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the measure of angle \( \angle AEC \) in the given geometric figure. Here's the breakdown of the information provided:

- **Given:**
  - Line \( AB \) is parallel to line \( CD \).
  - Line \( AE \) bisects \( \angle CAB \).
  - \( \angle ACD = 40^\circ \).

- **Objective:**
  - Find the measure of \( \angle AEC \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Use the property of parallel lines.
Since \( AB \parallel CD \), we can use the fact that alternate interior angles are equal. Specifically, \( \angle CAB \) (on line \( AB \)) and \( \angle ACD \) (on line \( CD \)) are corresponding angles because they are formed by the transversal \( AC \) intersecting the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( CD \). Therefore:
\[
\angle CAB = \angle ACD = 40^\circ.
\]

#### Step 2: Use the angle bisector property.
The problem states that \( AE \) bisects \( \angle CAB \). This means that \( AE \) divides \( \angle CAB \) into two equal parts. Thus:
\[
\angle CAE = \frac{1}{2} \angle CAB = \frac{1}{2} \times 40^\circ = 20^\circ.
\]

#### Step 3: Determine \( \angle AEC \) using the exterior angle theorem.
In triangle \( AEC \), \( \angle AEC \) is an exterior angle to \( \triangle AEC \) at vertex \( E \). The exterior angle theorem states that the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Here, the two non-adjacent interior angles are \( \angle CAE \) and \( \angle ACE \). Since \( \angle ACE = \angle ACD = 40^\circ \) (as established earlier), we have:
\[
\angle AEC = \angle CAE + \angle ACE = 20^\circ + 40^\circ = 60^\circ.
\]

However, upon re-evaluating the problem, we realize that \( \angle AEC \) is actually the supplementary angle to the interior angle we just calculated because it is formed by the extension of \( AE \) and \( CD \). Therefore, the correct measure of \( \angle AEC \) is:
\[
\angle AEC = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ.
\]
But this is incorrect based on the problem's setup. Revisiting the problem, we see that \( \angle AEC \) is simply the sum of the two angles without needing supplementary consideration, as it is directly asked for in the context of the bisected angle and parallel lines.

#### Correct Calculation:
Revisiting the direct approach, since \( \angle AEC \) is the sum of the bisected angle and the given angle:
\[
\angle AEC = 20^\circ + 40^\circ = 60^\circ.
\]
This was a misstep; the correct approach is to recognize that \( \angle AEC \) is simply the sum of the bisected angle and the given angle without needing supplementary consideration, leading to:
\[
\angle AEC = 70^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
