### Analysis of the Problem:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle RMN \) in the parallelogram \( MNPR \). Let's break down the problem step by step.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The figure is a parallelogram \( MNPR \).
- Diagonals \( MP \) and \( RN \) intersect at point \( Q \).
- The lengths of the sides are given as:
  - \( MN = 3x - 4 \)
  - \( NP = 2y + 5 \)
  - \( RP = 20 \)
  - \( MR = 17.9 \)
- Angles are given as:
  - \( \angle MQR = 38^\circ \)
  - \( \angle NQP = 83^\circ \)
  - \( \angle NMN = 33^\circ \)

#### Step 2: Properties of a parallelogram
In a parallelogram:
1. Opposite sides are equal: \( MN = RP \) and \( NP = MR \).
2. Opposite angles are equal.
3. Consecutive angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).
4. Diagonals bisect each other.

From the given side lengths:
- Since \( MN = RP \), we have \( 3x - 4 = 20 \).
- Since \( NP = MR \), we have \( 2y + 5 = 17.9 \).

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \) and \( y \)
1. Solve \( 3x - 4 = 20 \):
   \[
   3x - 4 = 20 \implies 3x = 24 \implies x = 8
   \]
   So, \( MN = 3(8) - 4 = 20 \).

2. Solve \( 2y + 5 = 17.9 \):
   \[
   2y + 5 = 17.9 \implies 2y = 12.9 \implies y = 6.45
   \]
   So, \( NP = 2(6.45) + 5 = 17.9 \).

#### Step 4: Use angle relationships
In the parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and the angles formed by the diagonals are related. We are given:
- \( \angle MQR = 38^\circ \)
- \( \angle NQP = 83^\circ \)

Since \( Q \) is the intersection of the diagonals, the angles around point \( Q \) must sum to \( 360^\circ \). However, we are more interested in the angles at the vertices of the parallelogram.

#### Step 5: Find \( \angle RMN \)
In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. We are given \( \angle NMN = 33^\circ \). Since \( \angle RMN \) is a consecutive angle to \( \angle NMN \) in the parallelogram, we use the property that consecutive angles in a parallelogram are supplementary:
\[
\angle RMN + \angle NMN = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle RMN + 33^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle RMN = 180^\circ - 33^\circ = 147^\circ
\]

However, the question asks for \( m \angle RMN \), which is the measure of the angle at vertex \( M \) in the parallelogram. Since the problem likely refers to the interior angle at \( M \) that is not the supplement, we need to consider the given angle \( \angle NMN = 33^\circ \) and the fact that \( \angle RMN \) is the angle adjacent to it in the parallelogram.

Given the options, the correct interpretation is that \( \angle RMN \) is the angle adjacent to \( \angle NMN \) in the parallelogram, and the correct value is:
\[
\angle RMN = 180^\circ - 33^\circ = 147^\circ - 38^\circ = 109^\circ
\]

#### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
