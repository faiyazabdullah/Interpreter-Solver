To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of the cone formed by rolling a sector of a circle into a cone-shaped paper cap. Let's go through the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The sector has a central angle of \(120^\circ\) and a radius of \(3\) cm.
- When this sector is rolled into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
- The radius of the sector becomes the slant height (\(l\)) of the cone.

### Step 2: Calculate the arc length of the sector
The formula for the arc length (\(L\)) of a sector is:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
\]
where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees, and \(r\) is the radius of the sector.

Here, \(\theta = 120^\circ\) and \(r = 3\) cm. Plugging in these values:
\[
L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 3 = \frac{1}{3} \times 6\pi = 2\pi \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 3: Relate the arc length to the circumference of the base of the cone
The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let \(r_c\) be the radius of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base of the cone is given by:
\[
2\pi r_c = 2\pi
\]
Solving for \(r_c\):
\[
r_c = 1 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 4: Determine the slant height of the cone
The radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. Therefore, the slant height (\(l\)) is:
\[
l = 3 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 5: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the cone
In a right triangle formed by the height (\(h\)), the radius of the base (\(r_c\)), and the slant height (\(l\)) of the cone, we have:
\[
l^2 = h^2 + r_c^2
\]
Substituting \(l = 3\) cm and \(r_c = 1\) cm:
\[
3^2 = h^2 + 1^2
\]
\[
9 = h^2 + 1
\]
\[
h^2 = 8
\]
\[
h = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \text{ cm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The height of the cone is \(2\sqrt{2}\) cm. Therefore, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
