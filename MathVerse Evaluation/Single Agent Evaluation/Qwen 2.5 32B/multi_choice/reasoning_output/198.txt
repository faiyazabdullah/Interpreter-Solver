QUESTION:
There is an isosceles triangle with side length 13 and base length 10. Find the area of the figure.

CHOICES:
A:30
B:60
C:120
D:240

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the solution steps carefully:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The figure is an **isosceles triangle**.
- The two equal sides of the triangle are each **13 units** long.
- The base of the triangle is **10 units** long.
- We need to find the **area** of the triangle.

### Step 2: Identify the geometric relationships
Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude (height) from the apex to the base will bisect the base into two equal segments. This means the base is divided into two segments of **5 units** each.

### Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height
Let the height of the triangle be \( h \). The height forms a right triangle with half of the base (5 units) and one of the equal sides (13 units) as the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
h^2 + 5^2 = 13^2
\]
\[
h^2 + 25 = 169
\]
\[
h^2 = 169 - 25
\]
\[
h^2 = 144
\]
\[
h = \sqrt{144} = 12
\]

So, the height of the triangle is **12 units**.

### Step 4: Calculate the area of the triangle
The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values we have:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 12 = \frac{1}{2} \times 120 = 60
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated area is **60**. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 30
- B: 60
- C: 120
- D: 240

The correct answer is **60**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
