### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given a geometric figure involving a circle \( O \) with tangents from an external point \( A \). The key elements are:
- Point \( A \) is outside the circle.
- \( AB \), \( AC \), and \( BD \) are tangents to the circle.
- The tangent points are \( P \), \( C \), and \( D \) respectively.
- The lengths are given as \( AB = 5.0 \) and \( AC = 3.0 \).
- We need to find the length of \( BD \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding Tangent Properties**
A fundamental property of tangents drawn from an external point to a circle is that the lengths of the tangents from that point to the points of tangency are equal. Mathematically:
- If \( AB \) and \( AC \) are tangents from point \( A \) to the circle at points \( P \) and \( C \) respectively, then:
  \[
  AP = AC
  \]
- Similarly, if \( BD \) and \( BP \) are tangents from point \( B \) to the circle at points \( D \) and \( P \) respectively, then:
  \[
  BD = BP
  \]

#### **Step 2: Applying the Property to the Given Problem**
From the problem, we know:
- \( AB = 5.0 \)
- \( AC = 3.0 \)

Using the tangent property:
1. Since \( AP = AC \), we have:
   \[
   AP = 3.0
   \]
2. The total length \( AB \) is the sum of \( AP \) and \( BP \):
   \[
   AB = AP + BP
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   5.0 = 3.0 + BP
   \]
   Solving for \( BP \):
   \[
   BP = 5.0 - 3.0 = 2.0
   \]

#### **Step 3: Finding the Length of \( BD \)**
Using the tangent property again:
- Since \( BD = BP \), we have:
  \[
  BD = BP = 2.0
  \]

### Final Answer:
The length of \( BD \) is \( 2.0 \).

Final Answer: B
