====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the solution steps systematically:

### Step 1: Examine the given information
- The base of the triangular prism is an **equilateral triangle** with side length \( x \).
- The height of the prism is \( \sqrt{3}x \).
- The volume of the prism is given as \( \frac{81}{4} \).

We need to find the value of \( x \).

### Step 2: Recall the formula for the volume of a prism
The volume \( V \) of a prism is given by:
\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the base (equilateral triangle)
The area \( A \) of an equilateral triangle with side length \( x \) is:
\[
A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x^2
\]

### Step 4: Express the volume of the prism
The height of the prism is \( \sqrt{3}x \). Therefore, the volume \( V \) of the prism is:
\[
V = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x^2 \right) \times (\sqrt{3}x)
\]

Simplify the expression:
\[
V = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} x^2 \cdot \sqrt{3}x = \frac{3}{4} x^3
\]

### Step 5: Set up the equation using the given volume
We are given that the volume \( V \) is \( \frac{81}{4} \). Thus:
\[
\frac{3}{4} x^3 = \frac{81}{4}
\]

### Step 6: Solve for \( x \)
First, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 4:
\[
3x^3 = 81
\]

Next, divide both sides by 3:
\[
x^3 = 27
\]

Take the cube root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt[3]{27} = 3
\]

### Step 7: Verify the answer
Substitute \( x = 3 \) back into the volume formula to ensure it matches the given volume:
\[
V = \frac{3}{4} (3)^3 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot 27 = \frac{81}{4}
\]
This confirms that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
