### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- Triangles \( \triangle WSR \) and \( \triangle TVR \) are similar.
- \( WS \parallel VT \).
- \( WS = 8 \).
- \( VT = 10 \).
- We need to find the length of \( WR \).

From the similarity of the triangles \( \triangle WSR \) and \( \triangle TVR \), we know that corresponding sides are proportional. Additionally, since \( WS \parallel VT \), the triangles are similar by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (or Thales' theorem).

#### **Step 2: Use the property of similar triangles**
Since \( \triangle WSR \sim \triangle TVR \), the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{WS}{VT} = \frac{WR}{TR}
\]
We are also given:
\[
WS = 8, \quad VT = 10
\]
Let \( WR = y \) and \( TR = z \). Then:
\[
\frac{8}{10} = \frac{y}{z}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{y}{z}
\]
This means:
\[
z = \frac{5}{4}y
\]

#### **Step 3: Use the given segment lengths involving \( x \)**
From the diagram, we see that:
- \( WR = x + 6 \)
- \( TR = 2x + 6 \)

Using the relationship \( z = \frac{5}{4}y \), we substitute \( y = WR = x + 6 \) and \( z = TR = 2x + 6 \):
\[
2x + 6 = \frac{5}{4}(x + 6)
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve the equation for \( x \)**
Multiply both sides by 4 to clear the fraction:
\[
4(2x + 6) = 5(x + 6)
\]
Expand both sides:
\[
8x + 24 = 5x + 30
\]
Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:
\[
3x + 24 = 30
\]
Subtract 24 from both sides:
\[
3x = 6
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
x = 2
\]

#### **Step 5: Find \( WR \)**
Now that we have \( x = 2 \), substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( WR \):
\[
WR = x + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8
\]

#### **Step 6: Verify the solution**
- \( WR = 8 \)
- \( TR = 2x + 6 = 2(2) + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 \)
- The ratio \( \frac{WR}{TR} = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5} \), which matches the ratio \( \frac{WS}{VT} = \frac{8}{10} = \frac{4}{5} \).

The calculations are consistent with the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
