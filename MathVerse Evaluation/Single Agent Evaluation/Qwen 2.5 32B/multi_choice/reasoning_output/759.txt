### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves a geometric figure where three lines intersect at a single point. This creates multiple angles around the point of intersection. We are tasked with finding the value of \( y \), given that two of the angles are \( y^\circ \) each and one angle is \( 50^\circ \).

#### Step 1: Identify the Given Information
- Three lines intersect at a single point.
- One angle is explicitly labeled as \( 50^\circ \).
- Two other angles are both labeled as \( y^\circ \).
- The sum of all angles around a point is always \( 360^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Use the Property of Angles Around a Point
The total sum of all angles around a point is \( 360^\circ \). In this case, we have four angles:
- Two angles are \( y^\circ \) each.
- One angle is \( 50^\circ \).
- The fourth angle is unknown but can be expressed in terms of \( y \).

Let the fourth angle be \( z^\circ \). Then, the sum of all four angles is:
\[
y + y + 50 + z = 360
\]
Simplify:
\[
2y + 50 + z = 360
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the Fourth Angle
Since the four angles are formed by the intersection of three lines, the fourth angle \( z \) is also related to the other angles. However, we do not need to find \( z \) explicitly because we can use the symmetry of the problem. Notice that the two angles labeled \( y^\circ \) are opposite each other, and the remaining two angles (one being \( 50^\circ \)) must also be symmetrically distributed.

#### Step 4: Solve for \( y \)
From the equation \( 2y + 50 + z = 360 \), we can express \( z \) as:
\[
z = 360 - 2y - 50 = 310 - 2y
\]
However, we can simplify the problem by recognizing that the two angles \( y^\circ \) are equal, and the total sum of the angles around the point is \( 360^\circ \). Thus, we can directly solve:
\[
2y + 50 + (360 - 2y - 50) = 360
\]
This confirms the setup. Now, focus on the two \( y \)-angles and the \( 50^\circ \) angle:
\[
2y + 50 + \text{(remaining angle)} = 360
\]
The remaining angle must be such that the total is \( 360^\circ \). Since the problem states there are only two \( y \)-angles and one \( 50^\circ \) angle, we can directly solve:
\[
2y + 50 + 50 = 360 - z
\]
But since \( z \) is part of the same system, we simplify:
\[
2y + 50 = 180 \quad \text{(since the opposite angles sum to half of 360 minus the given angle)}
\]
\[
2y = 180 - 50
\]
\[
2y = 130
\]
\[
y = 65
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Solution
If \( y = 65^\circ \), then the two angles are \( 65^\circ \) each, and the remaining angle is:
\[
360 - 65 - 65 - 50 = 180
\]
This confirms that the angles sum to \( 360^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
