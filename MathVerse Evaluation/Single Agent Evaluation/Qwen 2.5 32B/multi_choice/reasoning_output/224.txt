### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a regular polygon inscribed in a circle with center \( R \). The key information provided is:
- The polygon is regular, meaning all its sides and angles are equal.
- \( R \) is the center of the circle.
- \( RS \) is perpendicular to \( KL \).

We are tasked with finding the measure of a central angle of the polygon.

---

### Step 1: Identify Key Properties of a Regular Polygon
For a regular polygon:
1. All sides are equal.
2. All interior angles are equal.
3. The central angles (angles subtended at the center by consecutive vertices of the polygon) are also equal.
4. If the polygon has \( n \) sides, each central angle measures \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \).

---

### Step 2: Use the Perpendicularity Condition
The condition \( RS \perp KL \) indicates that \( RS \) is the radius of the circle and is perpendicular to the side \( KL \) of the polygon. This implies that \( S \) is the midpoint of \( KL \), and \( RS \) bisects the central angle subtended by \( KL \).

Since the polygon is regular, the central angle subtended by any side of the polygon is the same. Let the measure of this central angle be \( \theta \).

---

### Step 3: Determine the Number of Sides of the Polygon
From the image, we observe that the polygon appears to have 6 vertices (\( J, K, L, M, N, P \)). Therefore, the polygon is a regular hexagon.

For a regular hexagon:
- The number of sides \( n = 6 \).
- Each central angle is given by:
  \[
  \text{Central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n} = \frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ
  \]

---

### Step 4: Verify the Perpendicularity Condition
The perpendicularity condition \( RS \perp KL \) is consistent with the symmetry of a regular hexagon. In a regular hexagon, the radius drawn to the midpoint of any side is perpendicular to that side, confirming our analysis.

---

### Step 5: Conclusion
The measure of a central angle in a regular hexagon is \( 60^\circ \).

---
