QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, it is known that angle 1 = angle 2 = angle 3 = 55.0, then the degree of angle 4 is ()

CHOICES:
A:110°
B:115°
C:120°
D:125°

====================================================================================================
To solve for the degree of angle 4, let's follow the solution steps systematically:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
From the problem, we know:
- ∠1 = ∠2 = ∠3 = 55°.
- These angles are formed by intersecting lines, and we need to determine the measure of ∠4.

### Step 2: Analyze the geometric relationships
- ∠1 and ∠4 are supplementary because they form a linear pair (they are adjacent angles on a straight line).
- The property of supplementary angles states that the sum of two angles forming a linear pair is 180°.

### Step 3: Use the supplementary angle property
Since ∠1 and ∠4 are supplementary:
\[
∠1 + ∠4 = 180°
\]
Substitute the given value of ∠1:
\[
55° + ∠4 = 180°
\]

### Step 4: Solve for ∠4
Rearrange the equation to isolate ∠4:
\[
∠4 = 180° - 55°
\]
\[
∠4 = 125°
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of ∠4 is 125°. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 110°
- B: 115°
- C: 120°
- D: 125°

The correct answer matches choice D.

### Final Answer:
