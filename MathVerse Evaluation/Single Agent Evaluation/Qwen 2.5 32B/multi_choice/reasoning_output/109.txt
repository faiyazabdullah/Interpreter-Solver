### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given a geometric figure where one angle, \( \alpha \), is labeled as 130°. The goal is to find the measure of another angle, \( \beta \). Let's carefully analyze the relationships and apply geometric principles step by step.

#### Step 1: Identify Key Relationships
From the diagram:
- \( \alpha \) and \( \beta \) are related through a straight line and some intersecting lines.
- There appears to be a right triangle involved, suggesting the use of supplementary angles and properties of parallel lines.

#### Step 2: Use Supplementary Angles
The angle \( \alpha \) is given as 130°. Since \( \alpha \) is adjacent to a straight line, the angle directly adjacent to \( \alpha \) (on the same side of the straight line) must be its supplement. Therefore:
\[
\text{Supplement of } \alpha = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ
\]

#### Step 3: Analyze the Right Triangle
In the right triangle formed by the intersecting lines:
- One of the angles in the right triangle is 90° (as indicated by the right angle symbol).
- Another angle in the right triangle is the supplement of \( \alpha \), which we calculated as 50°.
- The third angle in the right triangle, which is \( \beta \), can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. However, since this is a right triangle, the sum of the two non-right angles must be 90°.

Thus:
\[
\beta = 90^\circ - 50^\circ = 40^\circ
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
- The supplement of \( \alpha \) is correctly calculated as 50°.
- In the right triangle, the angles must add up to 90° for the non-right angles. Since one of these angles is 50°, the other must be 40°.
- This matches our calculation for \( \beta \).

#### Final Answer:
Based on the above steps, the measure of \( \beta \) is 40°.

Final Answer: B
