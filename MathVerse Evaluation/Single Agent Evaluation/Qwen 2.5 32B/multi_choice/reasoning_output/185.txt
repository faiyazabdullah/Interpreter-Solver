### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**
- Circle \( O \) has a radius of \( 1.0 \).
- The distance from the center \( O \) of the circle to the line \( L \) is \( 3.0 \).
- A tangent is drawn from any point \( P \) on the line \( L \) to the circle, touching the circle at point \( Q \).
- The length \( PQ \) is used as the side of a square \( PQRS \).
- We need to find the **minimum area** of the square \( PQRS \).

#### **Step 2: Analyze the Geometry**
1. **Tangent Properties**: 
   - The radius \( OQ \) is perpendicular to the tangent line \( PQ \) at the point of tangency \( Q \).
   - Therefore, \( OQ \perp PQ \), and \( OQ = 1.0 \) (radius of the circle).

2. **Right Triangle \( OPQ \)**:
   - \( OQ \) is one leg of the right triangle \( OPQ \) with \( OQ = 1.0 \).
   - The distance from \( O \) to the line \( L \) is given as \( 3.0 \). This is the vertical distance from \( O \) to the horizontal line \( L \).
   - Let \( d = OP \) be the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( OPQ \).

3. **Pythagorean Theorem in \( \triangle OPQ \)**:
   - In \( \triangle OPQ \), we have:
     \[
     OP^2 = OQ^2 + PQ^2
     \]
   - Substituting \( OQ = 1.0 \):
     \[
     OP^2 = 1^2 + PQ^2 \implies OP^2 = 1 + PQ^2
     \]

4. **Distance from \( O \) to \( L \)**:
   - The vertical distance from \( O \) to \( L \) is \( 3.0 \). This is the length of the segment perpendicular from \( O \) to \( L \).
   - Since \( P \) lies on \( L \), the minimum value of \( OP \) occurs when \( P \) is directly below \( O \) (i.e., the shortest distance from \( O \) to \( L \)).

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Minimum Length of \( PQ \)**
- The minimum length of \( PQ \) occurs when \( P \) is directly below \( O \). In this case, \( OP \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the vertical distance \( 3.0 \) and the radius \( 1.0 \).
- Using the Pythagorean theorem in this configuration:
  \[
  OP^2 = OQ^2 + \text{(vertical distance)}^2
  \]
  \[
  OP^2 = 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10
  \]
  \[
  OP = \sqrt{10}
  \]

- Now, using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OPQ \):
  \[
  OP^2 = OQ^2 + PQ^2
  \]
  \[
  (\sqrt{10})^2 = 1^2 + PQ^2
  \]
  \[
  10 = 1 + PQ^2
  \]
  \[
  PQ^2 = 9
  \]
  \[
  PQ = \sqrt{9} = 3
  \]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Square \( PQRS \)**
- The side length of the square \( PQRS \) is \( PQ = 3 \).
- The area of the square is:
  \[
  \text{Area} = PQ^2 = 3^2 = 9
  \]

#### **Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The minimum area of the square \( PQRS \) is \( 9 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
