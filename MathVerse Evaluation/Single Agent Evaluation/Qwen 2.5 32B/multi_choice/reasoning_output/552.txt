QUESTION:
Ashlynn models the relationship between the temperature $C$ of a hot cup of tea (in degrees Celsius) and time $T$ since the tea was poured into the cup (in minutes) as $C=20+20 \cdot 0.88^T$. The temperature decreases when time increases, and passes points(0, 40). She wanted to graph the relationship over the first half hour. Here is her work: What mistakes did Ashlynn make when drawing the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Inappropriate scale for $x$-axis
B:Inappropriate scale for $y$-axis
C:Wrong/missing label for $x$-axis
D:Wrong/missing label for $y$-axis
E:Ashlynn didn't make any mistake

====================================================================================================
To analyze Ashlynn's graph and identify any mistakes, let's follow the solution steps:

### Step 1: Examine the given information
The equation provided is:
\[ C = 20 + 20 \cdot 0.88^T \]
where:
- \( C \) is the temperature in degrees Celsius.
- \( T \) is the time in minutes since the tea was poured.

### Step 2: Understand the relationship
- The temperature \( C \) starts at 40°C when \( T = 0 \):
  \[ C(0) = 20 + 20 \cdot 0.88^0 = 20 + 20 \cdot 1 = 40 \]
- As \( T \) increases, the term \( 20 \cdot 0.88^T \) decreases because \( 0.88^T \) is an exponential decay function. This means the temperature \( C \) will approach 20°C asymptotically as \( T \) increases.

### Step 3: Analyze Ashlynn's graph
From the graph:
- The \( x \)-axis is labeled "Time (minutes)" and ranges from 0 to 25 minutes.
- The \( y \)-axis is labeled "Temperature (degrees Celsius)" and ranges from 0 to 40°C.
- The graph shows a smooth curve starting at (0, 40) and decreasing over time, approaching 20°C but never reaching it.

### Step 4: Check for potential mistakes
#### A: Inappropriate scale for \( x \)-axis
- The \( x \)-axis ranges from 0 to 25 minutes, which covers the first half hour as requested. This scale is appropriate.
- **No issue here.**

#### B: Inappropriate scale for \( y \)-axis
- The \( y \)-axis ranges from 0 to 40°C. While this range includes the initial temperature of 40°C, it does not show the asymptotic behavior clearly enough. The temperature approaches 20°C but never reaches it, so a range that includes values below 20°C would be more appropriate to illustrate the asymptotic nature.
- **This could be considered a minor issue, but it is not a major flaw.**

#### C: Wrong/missing label for \( x \)-axis
- The \( x \)-axis is labeled "Time (minutes)," which is correct.
- **No issue here.**

#### D: Wrong/missing label for \( y \)-axis
- The \( y \)-axis is labeled "Temperature (degrees Celsius)," which is correct.
- **No issue here.**

#### E: Ashlynn didn't make any mistake
- The graph accurately represents the general shape of the function \( C = 20 + 20 \cdot 0.88^T \), starting at (0, 40) and approaching 20°C. However, the \( y \)-axis could be improved to better illustrate the asymptotic behavior.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The most significant issue is the scale of the \( y \)-axis, which does not adequately show the asymptotic approach to 20°C. Therefore, the most appropriate choice is:
