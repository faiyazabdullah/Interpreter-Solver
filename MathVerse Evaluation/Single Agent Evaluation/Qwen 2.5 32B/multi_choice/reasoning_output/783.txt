### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the value of \( z \) in the given geometric figure. The figure contains several angles, including \( x^\circ \), \( y^\circ \), and \( z^\circ \). The problem states that \( x = 20^\circ \) and \( y = 30^\circ \). Additionally, it mentions that two angles labeled \( x \) are equal, which we already know from the problem statement.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- \( x = 20^\circ \)
- \( y = 30^\circ \)
- Two angles labeled \( x \) are equal.
- We need to find the value of \( z \).

#### Step 2: Understand the geometric relationships
The figure consists of triangles. We can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). Let's break down the figure into manageable parts:

1. **Left Triangle**: The angles are \( y \), \( x \), and the third angle (which we will calculate).
2. **Right Triangle**: The angles are \( x \), \( z \), and the third angle (which we will calculate).

#### Step 3: Calculate the third angle in the left triangle
The left triangle has angles \( y = 30^\circ \) and \( x = 20^\circ \). Let the third angle be \( A \). Using the triangle angle sum property:
\[
y + x + A = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
30^\circ + 20^\circ + A = 180^\circ
\]
\[
50^\circ + A = 180^\circ
\]
\[
A = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
\]

So, the third angle in the left triangle is \( 130^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Use the straight line property for the right triangle
The angle \( A = 130^\circ \) forms a straight line with the angle \( z \) and another angle in the right triangle. The straight line property states that the sum of angles on a straight line is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore:
\[
130^\circ + z = 180^\circ
\]
\[
z = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ
\]

However, we need to re-evaluate the right triangle to ensure consistency. The right triangle has angles \( x = 20^\circ \), \( z \), and the third angle. Let the third angle be \( B \). Using the triangle angle sum property:
\[
x + z + B = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
20^\circ + z + B = 180^\circ
\]
From the straight line property, we know \( B = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ \). Substitute \( B = 50^\circ \):
\[
20^\circ + z + 50^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
\[
70^\circ + z = 180^\circ
\]
\[
z = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Re-evaluate the problem
Upon re-evaluating, we realize there was a miscalculation. The correct approach is to use the straight line property directly:
\[
130^\circ + z = 180^\circ
\]
\[
z = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ
\]

#### Step 6: Correct the calculation
The correct value of \( z \) is:
\[
z = 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ
\]

#### Final Answer:
The value of \( z \) is \( 80^\circ \).

Final Answer: C
