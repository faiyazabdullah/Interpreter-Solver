QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (0,1) and when the value of x increases the value of y increases, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given graph step by step:

### Step 1: Examine the Graph
The graph shows a curve that passes through the point \((0, 1)\). As the value of \(x\) increases, the value of \(y\) also increases. This indicates that the function is increasing over its domain.

### Step 2: Understand the Concept of Inverse Functions
For a function \(f(x)\) to have an inverse function, it must satisfy the **Horizontal Line Test**. This means that no horizontal line can intersect the graph of the function more than once. In other words, the function must be **one-to-one**.

### Step 3: Apply the Horizontal Line Test
From the graph:
- The curve appears to be strictly increasing, meaning that for any two different values of \(x\), say \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), the corresponding \(y\)-values \(f(x_1)\) and \(f(x_2)\) are also different.
- Since the function is strictly increasing, no horizontal line will intersect the graph more than once.

### Step 4: Determine if the Function Has an Inverse
Since the function passes the Horizontal Line Test, it is one-to-one. Therefore, the function has an inverse function.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
