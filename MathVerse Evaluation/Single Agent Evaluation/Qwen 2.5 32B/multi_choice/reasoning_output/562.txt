====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given information and the graph step by step.

### Step 1: Analyze the quadratic function \( g \)
The quadratic function \( g \) is described as opening upward, passing through the points \( (2, 4) \) and \( (6, 4) \), and having a vertex at \( (4, 0) \).

- **Vertex form of a quadratic function**: Since the vertex is \( (4, 0) \), we can write the equation of \( g \) in vertex form:
  \[
  g(x) = a(x - 4)^2 + 0 = a(x - 4)^2
  \]
  where \( a > 0 \) because the parabola opens upward.

- **Using the point \( (2, 4) \)**: Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 4 \) into the equation:
  \[
  4 = a(2 - 4)^2 = a(-2)^2 = 4a
  \]
  Solving for \( a \):
  \[
  a = 1
  \]
  Therefore, the equation of \( g \) is:
  \[
  g(x) = (x - 4)^2
  \]

### Step 2: Analyze the graph of \( f(x) \)
From the graph, we observe the following about \( f(x) \):
- The graph is a parabola that opens upward.
- The vertex of \( f(x) \) appears to be at \( (4, 0) \).
- The parabola intersects the \( x \)-axis at two distinct points, which means it has two real roots.

### Step 3: Determine the nature of the discriminant of \( f(x) \)
The discriminant of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
The discriminant tells us the nature of the roots:
- If \( \Delta > 0 \), the quadratic has two distinct real roots.
- If \( \Delta = 0 \), the quadratic has one repeated real root.
- If \( \Delta < 0 \), the quadratic has no real roots (complex roots).

From the graph of \( f(x) \):
- The parabola intersects the \( x \)-axis at two distinct points, indicating that \( f(x) \) has two distinct real roots.

Thus, the discriminant of \( f(x) \) must be positive.
