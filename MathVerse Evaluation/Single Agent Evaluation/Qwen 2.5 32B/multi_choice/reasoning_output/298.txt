### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**
- We have two circles, \(\odot J\) and \(\odot K\), with their diameters lying along the same straight line.
- The centers of the circles are \(J\) and \(K\), respectively.
- The radius of \(\odot J\) is 10 units, so its diameter is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) units.
- The radius of \(\odot K\) is 8 units, so its diameter is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) units.
- The distance between points \(B\) and \(C\) is given as \(BC = 5.4\) units.
- We need to find the distance \(JK\), which is the distance between the centers of the two circles.

#### **Step 2: Analyze the Geometric Configuration**
- Since the diameters of the circles lie along the same straight line, the centers \(J\) and \(K\) are also collinear with points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
- The point \(B\) is the intersection of the circle \(\odot J\) with the line segment joining the centers \(J\) and \(K\).
- The point \(C\) is the intersection of the circle \(\odot K\) with the same line segment.

#### **Step 3: Use the Given Distances**
- The distance from \(J\) to \(B\) is the radius of \(\odot J\), which is 10 units.
- The distance from \(K\) to \(C\) is the radius of \(\odot K\), which is 8 units.
- The distance between \(B\) and \(C\) is given as 5.4 units.

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Total Distance \(JK\)**
- The total distance \(JK\) is the sum of the following segments:
  1. The distance from \(J\) to \(B\) (which is the radius of \(\odot J\)): 10 units.
  2. The distance from \(B\) to \(C\): 5.4 units.
  3. The distance from \(C\) to \(K\) (which is the radius of \(\odot K\)): 8 units.

Thus, the total distance \(JK\) is:
\[
JK = JB + BC + CK = 10 + 5.4 + 8 = 23.4
\]

#### **Step 5: Compare with the Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \(JK\) is 23.4 units.
- However, since the problem asks for the closest answer choice, we need to recheck the options provided:
  - A: 12.6
  - B: 14.6
  - C: 20.6
  - D: 30.6

Given the options, the closest value to 23.4 is 20.6.

#### **Step 6: Final Answer**
Final Answer: C
