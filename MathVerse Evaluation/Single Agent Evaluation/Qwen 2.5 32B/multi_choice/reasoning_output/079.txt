### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The perimeter of parallelogram \(ABCD\) is 32.
- \(AC\) and \(BD\) are diagonals of the parallelogram, and they intersect at point \(O\).
- \(OE \perp AC\) and intersects \(AD\) at point \(E\).

#### **Step 2: Use properties of parallelograms**
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. Therefore:
  \[
  AB = CD \quad \text{and} \quad AD = BC
  \]
- The perimeter of parallelogram \(ABCD\) is given as 32. Thus:
  \[
  AB + BC + CD + DA = 32
  \]
  Since \(AB = CD\) and \(AD = BC\), we can rewrite the perimeter as:
  \[
  2(AB + AD) = 32 \implies AB + AD = 16
  \]

#### **Step 3: Understand the role of point \(O\)**
- Point \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore:
  \[
  AO = OC \quad \text{and} \quad BO = OD
  \]

#### **Step 4: Analyze the perpendicular \(OE\)** 
- \(OE \perp AC\), meaning \(OE\) is the altitude from \(E\) to \(AC\).
- Since \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AC\), \(E\) lies on \(AD\) such that \(OE\) is perpendicular to \(AC\).

#### **Step 5: Perimeter of triangle \(DCE\)** 
To find the perimeter of triangle \(DCE\), we need to calculate:
\[
DE + EC + CD
\]

##### **Key Insight: Using symmetry and properties of parallelograms**
- Since \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AC\), and \(OE \perp AC\), \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AD\) (by symmetry and properties of parallelograms).
- Therefore, \(DE = \frac{1}{2} AD\) and \(EC = \frac{1}{2} AC\).

##### **Calculate the lengths**
1. **Length of \(CD\):**
   From the perimeter of the parallelogram, we know:
   \[
   AB + AD = 16
   \]
   Since \(AB = CD\), we have:
   \[
   CD = AB
   \]

2. **Length of \(DE\):**
   Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AD\):
   \[
   DE = \frac{1}{2} AD
   \]

3. **Length of \(EC\):**
   Since \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AC\) and \(OE \perp AC\), \(E\) divides \(AD\) such that \(EC\) is half the length of \(AC\). However, we do not need the exact length of \(AC\) to solve the problem directly.

#### **Perimeter of triangle \(DCE\):**
The perimeter of triangle \(DCE\) is:
\[
DE + EC + CD
\]
Using the fact that \(DE = \frac{1}{2} AD\) and \(EC = \frac{1}{2} AC\), and knowing that \(CD = AB\), we can use the symmetry and properties of the parallelogram to conclude:
\[
DE + EC + CD = \frac{1}{2} AD + \frac{1}{2} AC + CD
\]
Since \(AB + AD = 16\) and \(CD = AB\), the perimeter of triangle \(DCE\) is half the perimeter of the parallelogram:
\[
DE + EC + CD = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 = 16
\]

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
