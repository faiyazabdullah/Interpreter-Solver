### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**
- The figure shows a rectangle \(ABCD\) with:
  - Length \(BC = l\)
  - Width \(DC = w\)
- Inside the rectangle, there is an ellipse that fits perfectly within the rectangle. The major axis of the ellipse is equal to the length of the rectangle (\(l\)), and the minor axis is equal to the width of the rectangle (\(w\)).
- The area of the shaded region (the ellipse) is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area of the ellipse} = \frac{\pi \cdot l \cdot w}{4}
  \]
- We are also told that the area of the shaded region is \(7\pi\).

#### **Step 2: Use the Given Area of the Shaded Region**
From the problem, we know:
\[
\frac{\pi \cdot l \cdot w}{4} = 7\pi
\]
To find \(l \cdot w\), we can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{l \cdot w}{4} = 7
\]
Multiply both sides by 4:
\[
l \cdot w = 28
\]

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Area of Rectangle \(ABCD\)**
The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = l \cdot w
\]
From the previous step, we already found that:
\[
l \cdot w = 28
\]
Thus, the area of the rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = 28
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Area of the Unshaded Regions**
The unshaded regions are the parts of the rectangle that are outside the ellipse. The area of the unshaded regions is the total area of the rectangle minus the area of the shaded region (ellipse):
\[
\text{Area of unshaded regions} = \text{Area of rectangle} - \text{Area of ellipse}
\]
We know:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = 28
\]
\[
\text{Area of ellipse} = 7\pi
\]
Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
\[
7\pi \approx 7 \times 3.14 = 21.98
\]
Thus, the area of the unshaded regions is:
\[
\text{Area of unshaded regions} = 28 - 21.98 = 6.02
\]

#### **Step 5: Round to the Nearest Whole Number**
The area of the unshaded regions, rounded to the nearest whole number, is:
\[
6.02 \approx 6
\]

#### **Step 6: Select the Correct Answer Choice**
The closest whole number to 6.02 is 6. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
