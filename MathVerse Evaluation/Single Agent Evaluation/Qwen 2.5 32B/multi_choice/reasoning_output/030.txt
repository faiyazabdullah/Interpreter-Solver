### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric figure where \( OA = OB = OC \), meaning points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on a circle centered at \( O \). The angle \( \angle ACB = 30^\circ \) is given, and we need to find the measure of \( \angle AOB \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- Since \( OA = OB = OC \), point \( O \) is the center of a circle, and \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are points on the circumference.
- The angle \( \angle ACB \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AB \).
- The relationship between an inscribed angle and the central angle subtending the same arc is given by the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.

#### Step 2: Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem
- Let \( \angle AOB = x \). According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
  \[
  \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOB
  \]
- We are given \( \angle ACB = 30^\circ \). Substituting this into the equation:
  \[
  30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} x
  \]

#### Step 3: Solving for \( x \)
- To find \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
  \[
  x = 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Verifying the Solution
- The central angle \( \angle AOB \) is twice the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \), which aligns with the Inscribed Angle Theorem.
- Therefore, \( \angle AOB = 60^\circ \).

#### Final Answer:
The size of \( \angle AOB \) is \( 60^\circ \).
