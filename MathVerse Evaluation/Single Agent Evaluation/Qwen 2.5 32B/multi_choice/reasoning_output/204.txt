### Problem Analysis:
We are given two similar triangles, \( \triangle XNM \) and \( \triangle XYZ \), with a shared vertex \( X \). The sides \( MN \) and \( YZ \) are parallel. The given measurements are:
- \( XN = 6 \)
- \( XM = 2 \)
- \( XY = 10 \)

We need to find the length of \( NZ \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Similarity**
Since \( \triangle XNM \sim \triangle XYZ \), the corresponding sides are proportional. The similarity ratio between the triangles can be determined using the given side lengths.

The similarity ratio is given by the ratio of the corresponding sides:
\[
\text{Similarity ratio} = \frac{XY}{XM}
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\text{Similarity ratio} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
\]

#### **Step 2: Use the Proportionality of Corresponding Sides**
Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the corresponding sides is constant. Therefore, the ratio of \( XN \) to \( XZ \) is also 5:
\[
\frac{XZ}{XN} = 5
\]
Let \( XZ = d \). Then:
\[
\frac{d}{6} = 5
\]
Solve for \( d \):
\[
d = 6 \times 5 = 30
\]
Thus, \( XZ = 30 \).

#### **Step 3: Find \( NZ \)**
The length \( NZ \) is the difference between \( XZ \) and \( XN \):
\[
NZ = XZ - XN
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
NZ = 30 - 6 = 24
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
