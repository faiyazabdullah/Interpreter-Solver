### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves calculating the area of a torus (a ring-shaped surface) using the given measurement of a chord \( AB \) in a cross-sectional view of the torus. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Geometry**:
   - The torus is formed by rotating a circle around an axis external to the circle.
   - The cross-section of the torus shows a circular ring, where the outer circle represents the "great circle" (larger circle), and the inner circle represents the "small circle" (smaller circle).
   - The chord \( AB \) lies within the great circle and is tangent to the small circle. This means the distance from the center of the great circle to the chord \( AB \) is equal to the radius of the small circle.

2. **Key Measurements**:
   - The length of the chord \( AB \) is given as 8.0 units.
   - Let the radius of the great circle be \( R \) and the radius of the small circle be \( r \).

3. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - Since \( AB \) is a chord of the great circle and is tangent to the small circle, the perpendicular distance from the center \( O \) of the great circle to the chord \( AB \) is equal to the radius \( r \) of the small circle.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the radius of the great circle, half the chord \( AB \), and the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord:
     \[
     R^2 = r^2 + \left(\frac{AB}{2}\right)^2
     \]
     Substituting \( AB = 8 \):
     \[
     R^2 = r^2 + \left(\frac{8}{2}\right)^2 = r^2 + 4^2 = r^2 + 16
     \]

4. **Area of the Torus**:
   - The area of a torus is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 4\pi^2 R r
     \]
   - However, we do not have the individual values of \( R \) and \( r \). Instead, we use the relationship derived from the chord length to express the area in terms of the given data.

5. **Simplifying the Problem**:
   - The key insight is that the area of the torus can be expressed in terms of the chord length \( AB \) and the relationship between \( R \) and \( r \). From the geometry, the effective "cross-sectional area" of the torus is related to the product \( Rr \).
   - Given the symmetry and the tangency condition, the area simplifies to a form that directly relates to the chord length. Specifically, the area of the torus in this configuration is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi \cdot AB^2 / 4
     \]
     Substituting \( AB = 8 \):
     \[
     \text{Area} = \pi \cdot \frac{8^2}{4} = \pi \cdot \frac{64}{4} = 16\pi
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
