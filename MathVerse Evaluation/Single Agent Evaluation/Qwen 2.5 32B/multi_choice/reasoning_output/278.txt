### Analysis of the Problem:
We are tasked with finding the scale factor between two similar triangles, \( W \) (green) and \( W' \) (blue), with respect to a reference point \( F \). The key steps involve analyzing the given dimensions and using the properties of similar triangles.

#### Step 1: Identify the Given Information
- The larger triangle \( W \) has a side length of 8 units.
- The smaller triangle \( W' \) is similar to \( W \).
- The distance from \( F \) to the base of \( W \) is 12 units.
- The distance from \( F \) to the base of \( W' \) is \( x \) units.
- The triangles are similar, meaning corresponding sides are proportional.

#### Step 2: Understand the Relationships
Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of their distances from the reference point \( F \). This is a property of similar triangles when they are perspective from a point.

#### Step 3: Use the Proportionality Property
The scale factor between two similar triangles can be determined by the ratio of their corresponding side lengths or the ratio of their distances from the reference point \( F \).

Let:
- \( d_W = 12 \) (distance from \( F \) to the base of \( W \)).
- \( d_{W'} = x \) (distance from \( F \) to the base of \( W' \)).
- The side length of \( W \) is 8 units.
- The side length of \( W' \) is proportional to 8.

The scale factor \( k \) from \( W \) to \( W' \) is given by:
\[
k = \frac{\text{Side length of } W'}{\text{Side length of } W} = \frac{x}{12}
\]

However, we need to express the scale factor in terms of the given dimensions. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the distances from \( F \) to the bases of the triangles is the same as the ratio of their side lengths:
\[
\frac{\text{Side length of } W'}{\text{Side length of } W} = \frac{x}{12}
\]

#### Step 4: Determine the Scale Factor
From the diagram, we observe that the side length of \( W \) is 8 units, and the side length of \( W' \) is proportional. The ratio of the distances from \( F \) to the bases of the triangles is:
\[
\frac{\text{Side length of } W'}{\text{Side length of } W} = \frac{x}{12}
\]

Given that the side length of \( W \) is 8 units, and the side length of \( W' \) is proportional, we can use the fact that the triangles are similar and the ratio of the distances is the same as the ratio of the side lengths:
\[
\frac{\text{Side length of } W'}{\text{Side length of } W} = \frac{x}{12}
\]

Since the triangles are similar, the scale factor is:
\[
k = \frac{\text{Side length of } W'}{\text{Side length of } W} = \frac{8}{12} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Scale Factor
The scale factor \( k \) is the ratio of the side lengths of the smaller triangle to the larger triangle. Since the side length of \( W \) is 8 units and the side length of \( W' \) is proportional, the scale factor is:
\[
k = \frac{2}{3}
\]

#### Final Answer:
The scale factor from \( W \) to \( W' \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

\[
\boxed{B}
\]
