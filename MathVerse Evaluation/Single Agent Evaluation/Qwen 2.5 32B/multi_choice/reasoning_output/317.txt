### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the given information from the image**
- The figure shows a circle with center \( F \).
- Points \( B, C, D, A \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- \( AC \) is a diameter of the circle.
- \( \angle CFD = (4a - 1)^\circ \).
- \( \angle AFB = 72^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle AFB \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the geometric relationships**
- Since \( AC \) is a diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles. This implies that \( \angle AFC \) and \( \angle AFC \) are supplementary to the angles subtended by the arcs they intercept.
- The key property we will use is that the sum of the central angles around point \( F \) is \( 360^\circ \).

#### **Step 3: Express the central angles in terms of \( a \)**
- The central angle \( \angle CFD \) is given as \( (4a - 1)^\circ \).
- The central angle \( \angle AFD \) is given as \( (2a - 5)^\circ \).
- The central angle \( \angle AFB \) is given as \( 72^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Use the property of the sum of central angles**
- The sum of the central angles around point \( F \) is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore:
  \[
  \angle AFB + \angle BFC + \angle CFD + \angle DFA = 360^\circ
  \]
- From the image, we can see that \( \angle BFC \) is the remaining angle. However, we do not have its direct value, so we focus on the angles we know:
  \[
  \angle AFB + \angle CFD + \angle AFD = 360^\circ - \angle BFC
  \]

#### **Step 5: Substitute the known values**
- Substitute the given values into the equation:
  \[
  72^\circ + (4a - 1)^\circ + (2a - 5)^\circ = 360^\circ - \angle BFC
  \]
- Simplify the left-hand side:
  \[
  72 + 4a - 1 + 2a - 5 = 360 - \angle BFC
  \]
  \[
  66 + 6a = 360 - \angle BFC
  \]

#### **Step 6: Solve for \( a \) using the relationship between \( \angle CFD \) and \( \angle AFD \)**
- Since \( AC \) is a diameter, \( \angle CFD \) and \( \angle AFD \) are related to the remaining angles. However, we can directly use the fact that the sum of the angles around \( F \) is \( 360^\circ \):
  \[
  72 + (4a - 1) + (2a - 5) + \angle BFC = 360
  \]
- Simplify:
  \[
  72 + 4a - 1 + 2a - 5 + \angle BFC = 360
  \]
  \[
  66 + 6a + \angle BFC = 360
  \]
  \[
  \angle BFC = 360 - 66 - 6a
  \]
  \[
  \angle BFC = 294 - 6a
  \]

#### **Step 7: Solve for \( a \) using the relationship between \( \angle CFD \) and \( \angle AFD \)**
- Since \( \angle CFD = (4a - 1) \) and \( \angle AFD = (2a - 5) \), we can use the fact that the sum of these angles plus \( \angle AFB \) and \( \angle BFC \) must equal \( 360^\circ \):
  \[
  72 + (4a - 1) + (2a - 5) + \angle BFC = 360
  \]
- Simplify:
  \[
  72 + 4a - 1 + 2a - 5 + \angle BFC = 360
  \]
  \[
  66 + 6a + \angle BFC = 360
  \]
  \[
  \angle BFC = 294 - 6a
  \]

#### **Step 8: Determine the measure of \( \angle AFB \)**
- From the problem, \( \angle AFB = 72^\circ \) is already given. We need to verify if this is consistent with the other angles:
  \[
  72 + (4a - 1) + (2a - 5) + \angle BFC = 360
  \]
- Since \( \angle AFB = 72^\circ \) is part of the given information and does not contradict the sum of angles around \( F \), the measure of \( \angle AFB \) is indeed \( 72^\circ \).

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
