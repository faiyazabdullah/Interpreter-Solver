### Analysis of the Problem:
The given image shows a right triangle with the following characteristics:
- One of the acute angles is \(45^\circ\).
- One of the legs (adjacent to the \(45^\circ\) angle) has a length of 4.
- The hypotenuse is labeled as \(x\).

Since the triangle is a right triangle and one of its acute angles is \(45^\circ\), it is a **45-45-90 triangle**. In a 45-45-90 triangle:
- The two legs are congruent.
- The hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{2}\) times the length of each leg.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify the type of triangle:**
   - The triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle because one of the acute angles is \(45^\circ\) and it is a right triangle.

2. **Determine the lengths of the legs:**
   - Since one leg is given as 4, the other leg must also be 4 (because the legs in a 45-45-90 triangle are equal).

3. **Use the relationship between the hypotenuse and the legs:**
   - In a 45-45-90 triangle, the hypotenuse \(x\) is given by:
     \[
     x = \text{leg} \times \sqrt{2}
     \]
   - Here, the leg is 4. Therefore:
     \[
     x = 4 \times \sqrt{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate the value of \(x\):**
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     x = 4\sqrt{2}
     \]

5. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   - The calculated value of \(x\) is \(4\sqrt{2}\).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: \(4\sqrt{2}\)
     - B: \(4\sqrt{3}\)
     - C: 8
     - D: \(4\sqrt{5}\)

6. **Select the correct answer:**
   - The calculated value matches option A.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
