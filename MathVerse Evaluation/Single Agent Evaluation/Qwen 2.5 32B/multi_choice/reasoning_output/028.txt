### Problem Analysis:
We are given:
- A right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
- An equilateral triangle \( \triangle ABD \) with \( AB \) as one of its sides.
- We need to find the size of \( \angle CAB \) when the length of \( CD \) is maximized.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \). Therefore, \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.
- \( \triangle ABD \) is an equilateral triangle, so all its sides are equal, and each internal angle is \( 60^\circ \). Thus, \( AB = AD = BD \).

#### Step 2: Positioning and Coordinates
To simplify the problem, we can place the points in a coordinate system:
- Let \( A = (0, 0) \).
- Let \( B = (c, 0) \), where \( c \) is the length of \( AB \).
- Since \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \), point \( C \) lies on the perpendicular from \( B \) to \( AC \). Let \( C = (x, y) \). Then, \( AC \perp BC \).

#### Step 3: Properties of Equilateral Triangle \( \triangle ABD \)
- In \( \triangle ABD \), since it is equilateral, point \( D \) is such that \( AD = AB = BD \).
- The coordinates of \( D \) can be determined using the rotation of point \( B \) around \( A \) by \( 60^\circ \) counterclockwise. The rotation formula for a point \( (x, y) \) rotated by \( \theta \) around the origin is:
  \[
  (x', y') = (x \cos \theta - y \sin \theta, x \sin \theta + y \cos \theta)
  \]
  Applying this to \( B = (c, 0) \) rotated by \( 60^\circ \):
  \[
  D = \left( c \cos 60^\circ - 0 \cdot \sin 60^\circ, c \sin 60^\circ + 0 \cdot \cos 60^\circ \right) = \left( \frac{c}{2}, \frac{c\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)
  \]

#### Step 4: Maximizing the Length of \( CD \)
- The length of \( CD \) is given by the distance formula:
  \[
  CD = \sqrt{(x_D - x_C)^2 + (y_D - y_C)^2}
  \]
  where \( D = \left( \frac{c}{2}, \frac{c\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) \) and \( C = (x, y) \).

- To maximize \( CD \), we need to consider the geometric configuration. Notice that \( C \) lies on a circle centered at \( A \) with radius \( AC \), and \( D \) is fixed. The maximum distance \( CD \) occurs when \( C \) is positioned such that \( CD \) is maximized.

#### Step 5: Geometric Insight
- The key insight is that \( CD \) is maximized when \( C \) is positioned such that \( \angle CAB \) is \( 30^\circ \). This is because:
  - In the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \), if \( \angle CAB = 30^\circ \), then \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \).
  - When \( \angle CAB = 30^\circ \), the configuration ensures that \( C \) is farthest from \( D \) along the circle centered at \( A \).

#### Step 6: Verification
- When \( \angle CAB = 30^\circ \):
  - \( \angle ABC = 60^\circ \) (since \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \)).
  - This configuration ensures that \( C \) is at the farthest possible position from \( D \) while maintaining the right triangle and equilateral triangle properties.

### Final Answer:
The size of \( \angle CAB \) that maximizes the length of \( CD \) is \( 30^\circ \).
