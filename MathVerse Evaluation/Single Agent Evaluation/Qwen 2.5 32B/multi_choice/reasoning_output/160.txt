QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( \tan B \) in the given right triangle \( \triangle ABC \), let's follow the steps systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- \( \angle C = 90^\circ \) (right angle)
- \( AB = 10 \) (hypotenuse)
- \( AC = 8 \) (one of the legs)

We need to find \( \tan B \).

### Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the missing side
In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
10^2 = 8^2 + BC^2
\]
\[
100 = 64 + BC^2
\]
Solve for \( BC \):
\[
BC^2 = 100 - 64
\]
\[
BC^2 = 36
\]
\[
BC = \sqrt{36} = 6
\]

So, the length of \( BC \) is 6.

### Step 3: Recall the definition of tangent
The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. For \( \angle B \):
\[
\tan B = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
Here, the side opposite to \( \angle B \) is \( AC \) (which has length 8), and the side adjacent to \( \angle B \) is \( BC \) (which has length 6). Therefore:
\[
\tan B = \frac{AC}{BC} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( \tan B \) is \( \frac{4}{3} \). This matches option D.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
