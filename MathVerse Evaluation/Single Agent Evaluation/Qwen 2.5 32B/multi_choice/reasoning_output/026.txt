QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to measure the height of the school flagpole, Xiaodong uses a bamboo pole with a length of 3.2 as a measuring tool, and moves the bamboo pole so that the top of the bamboo pole and the shadow of the top of the flag pole fall on the same point on the ground. At this time, the distance between the bamboo pole and this point is 8.0 , 22.0 from the flagpole, the height of the flagpole is ().

CHOICES:
A:8.8
B:10
C:12
D:14

====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we will use the principles of similar triangles. Let's go through the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem and Diagram
The diagram shows:
- A flagpole with an unknown height \( H \).
- A bamboo pole of length 3.2 meters.
- The bamboo pole is placed such that its top and the shadow of the top of the flagpole coincide at the same point on the ground.
- The distance between the bamboo pole and the coinciding point is 8 meters.
- The distance between the flagpole and the coinciding point is 22 meters.

We need to find the height of the flagpole (\( H \)).

### Step 2: Set Up Similar Triangles
The key observation here is that the triangle formed by the flagpole and its shadow is similar to the triangle formed by the bamboo pole and its shadow. This is because the sun's rays are parallel, creating similar triangles.

#### Triangle 1 (Flagpole and Shadow):
- Height of the flagpole: \( H \)
- Length of the shadow of the flagpole: 22 meters

#### Triangle 2 (Bamboo Pole and Shadow):
- Height of the bamboo pole: 3.2 meters
- Length of the shadow of the bamboo pole: 8 meters

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of flagpole}}{\text{Length of shadow of flagpole}} = \frac{\text{Height of bamboo pole}}{\text{Length of shadow of bamboo pole}}
\]

### Step 3: Write the Proportion
Using the similarity of triangles:
\[
\frac{H}{22} = \frac{3.2}{8}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( H \)
First, simplify the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
\frac{3.2}{8} = 0.4
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{H}{22} = 0.4
\]

Now, solve for \( H \) by multiplying both sides by 22:
\[
H = 0.4 \times 22
\]
\[
H = 8.8
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated height of the flagpole is 8.8 meters. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 8.8
- B: 10
- C: 12
- D: 14

The correct answer matches choice A.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
