### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a graph of a function \( f(x) \). The curve is a parabola that opens upward, as indicated by its shape. Key observations from the graph:
- The parabola passes through the points \( (0, 0) \) and \( (20, 0) \).
- The vertex of the parabola appears to be at a point where \( x = 10 \) (the midpoint between 0 and 20).

#### Step 2: Understand the Function
The problem states that the function is a **quadratic function** that opens upward and passes through the points \( (0, 0) \) and \( (20, 0) \). A general quadratic function can be written as:
\[
f(x) = a(x - r_1)(x - r_2)
\]
where \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) are the roots of the quadratic equation. Here, the roots are \( r_1 = 0 \) and \( r_2 = 20 \). Thus, the function can be expressed as:
\[
f(x) = a(x - 0)(x - 20) = ax(x - 20)
\]
Since the parabola opens upward, \( a > 0 \).

#### Step 3: Determine Whether the Function is One-to-One
A function is **one-to-one** if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. This is known as the **horizontal line test**. If any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function is not one-to-one.

From the graph:
- The parabola is symmetric about the vertical line \( x = 10 \).
- For any \( y \)-value above the vertex, there are two corresponding \( x \)-values (one on each side of the vertex).
- For example, if we draw a horizontal line at \( y = 10 \), it intersects the parabola at two distinct points.

This observation violates the horizontal line test, indicating that the function is not one-to-one.

#### Step 4: Conclusion
Since the quadratic function \( f(x) = ax(x - 20) \) is a parabola that opens upward and is symmetric, it fails the horizontal line test. Therefore, the function is not one-to-one.

### Final Answer:
