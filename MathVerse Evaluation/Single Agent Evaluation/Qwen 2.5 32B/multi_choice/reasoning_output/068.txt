### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves calculating the sum of the areas of three specific figures circled in a geometric diagram. Let's break down the solution step by step.

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- The side length of the square is **12 cm**.
- The square is divided into several smaller regions, including triangles and rectangles.
- Three specific figures are circled in the diagram. These figures are triangular regions.

#### Step 2: Identify the Circled Figures
From the diagram:
1. The first circled figure is a right triangle in the top-left corner.
2. The second circled figure is a right triangle in the bottom-left corner.
3. The third circled figure is a right triangle in the center-right region.

#### Step 3: Calculate the Area of Each Circled Figure
We will calculate the area of each circled triangle using the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[
\text{Area of a triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

##### Triangle 1: Top-Left Corner
- Base = 12 cm (side of the square)
- Height = 6 cm (half the side length of the square, as indicated by the diagonal division)
\[
\text{Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 6 = 36 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### Triangle 2: Bottom-Left Corner
- Base = 6 cm (half the side length of the square)
- Height = 6 cm (half the side length of the square)
\[
\text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6 = 18 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### Triangle 3: Center-Right Region
- Base = 6 cm (half the side length of the square)
- Height = 6 cm (half the side length of the square)
\[
\text{Area}_3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6 = 18 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Sum the Areas of the Three Circled Figures
\[
\text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_1 + \text{Area}_2 + \text{Area}_3 = 36 + 18 + 18 = 72 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Compare with the Answer Choices
The answer choices provided are:
A: 12 cm  
B: 24 cm  
C: 36 cm  
D: 48 cm  

However, the calculated total area is **72 cm²**, which does not match any of the given choices. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem or the answer choices. Upon re-examining the problem, it appears the question asks for the sum of the **perimeters** of the circled figures, not their areas.

#### Step 6: Recalculate the Perimeters of the Circled Figures
##### Perimeter of Triangle 1: Top-Left Corner
- The triangle has sides of 12 cm, 6 cm, and the hypotenuse.
- Hypotenuse = \(\sqrt{12^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{144 + 36} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}\) cm
\[
\text{Perimeter}_1 = 12 + 6 + 6\sqrt{5}
\]

##### Perimeter of Triangle 2: Bottom-Left Corner
- The triangle has sides of 6 cm, 6 cm, and the hypotenuse.
- Hypotenuse = \(\sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}\) cm
\[
\text{Perimeter}_2 = 6 + 6 + 6\sqrt{2} = 12 + 6\sqrt{2}
\]

##### Perimeter of Triangle 3: Center-Right Region
- The triangle has sides of 6 cm, 6 cm, and the hypotenuse.
- Hypotenuse = \(\sqrt{6^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{36 + 36} = \sqrt{72} = 6\sqrt{2}\) cm
\[
\text{Perimeter}_3 = 6 + 6 + 6\sqrt{2} = 12 + 6\sqrt{2}
\]

##### Total Perimeter
\[
\text{Total Perimeter} = \text{Perimeter}_1 + \text{Perimeter}_2 + \text{Perimeter}_3 = (12 + 6 + 6\sqrt{5}) + (12 + 6\sqrt{2}) + (12 + 6\sqrt{2})
\]
\[
= 30 + 6\sqrt{5} + 12\sqrt{2}
\]

Given the complexity and the mismatch with the answer choices, it is reasonable to assume the problem intended the sum of the **areas** of the circled figures, which is **72 cm²**. However, since the answer choices do not include this value, we must conclude the problem likely refers to perimeters, but the provided choices are still incorrect. 

Given the context and the closest match in the spirit of the problem, the correct interpretation aligns with the sum of areas, leading us to:
