QUESTION:
There is a curve that goes through (-3,0), (-2,1), and (-1,2). Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A:This is a one-to-one function
B:This is not a one-to-one function

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given information and apply the necessary steps:

### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a curve that passes through specific points: (-3, 0), (-2, 1), and (-1, 2). The curve appears smooth and continuous, and we need to determine whether this relation represents a **one-to-one function**.

### Step 2: Understand the Definition of a One-to-One Function
A function is **one-to-one** if every element in the domain maps to a unique element in the range, and no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the range. In graphical terms, a one-to-one function satisfies the **horizontal line test**: No horizontal line intersects the graph at more than one point.

### Step 3: Apply the Horizontal Line Test
From the image:
- Draw horizontal lines across the graph.
- Observe where these lines intersect the curve.

#### Observations:
1. The curve appears to be strictly increasing, meaning as \( x \) increases, \( y \) also increases.
2. No horizontal line intersects the curve at more than one point. This can be visually confirmed by drawing hypothetical horizontal lines at various heights (e.g., \( y = 1 \), \( y = 2 \), etc.).

Since no horizontal line intersects the curve more than once, the function passes the horizontal line test.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Based on the horizontal line test, the relation represented by the curve is a one-to-one function.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
