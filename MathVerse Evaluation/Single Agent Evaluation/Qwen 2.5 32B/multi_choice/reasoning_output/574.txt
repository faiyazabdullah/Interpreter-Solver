QUESTION:
Simon has a certain length of fencing to enclose a rectangular area. The quadratic function A with a vertec of (10, 100) models the rectangle's area (in square meters) as a function of its width (in meters). It intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). Which of these statements are true?

CHOICES:
A:Greater width always relates to smaller area.
B:Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than $10 \mathrm{~m}$.
C:When there is no width, the area is $20 \mathrm{~m}^2$.
D:When there is no width, the area is $0 \mathrm{~m}^2$.

### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure and Given Information
The image shows a graph of a quadratic function \( A \), which represents the area of a rectangle as a function of its width. Key observations from the graph:
- The vertex of the parabola is at \( (10, 100) \), indicating the maximum area occurs when the width is 10 meters, and the maximum area is 100 square meters.
- The function intersects the x-axis at \( (0, 0) \) and \( (20, 0) \), meaning the area is zero when the width is either 0 meters or 20 meters.
- The quadratic function is symmetric about the vertical line \( x = 10 \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
The quadratic function can be described generally as:
\[ A(w) = -k(w - 10)^2 + 100 \]
where \( w \) is the width, and \( k \) is a positive constant. The negative sign indicates the parabola opens downward.

From the graph:
- When \( w = 0 \) or \( w = 20 \), \( A(w) = 0 \).
- When \( w = 10 \), \( A(w) = 100 \).

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to evaluate the truthfulness of the given statements:
1. **Statement A**: Greater width always relates to smaller area.
2. **Statement B**: Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than \( 10 \mathrm{~m} \).
3. **Statement C**: When there is no width, the area is \( 20 \mathrm{~m}^2 \).
4. **Statement D**: When there is no width, the area is \( 0 \mathrm{~m}^2 \).

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric and Logical Reasoning
1. **Statement A**: "Greater width always relates to smaller area."
   - This statement is **false** because the graph shows that the area increases as the width increases from 0 to 10 meters. Only after the width exceeds 10 meters does the area start decreasing.

2. **Statement B**: "Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than \( 10 \mathrm{~m} \)."
   - This statement is **false** for the same reason as Statement A. The area increases as the width increases from 0 to 10 meters.

3. **Statement C**: "When there is no width, the area is \( 20 \mathrm{~m}^2 \)."
   - This statement is **false**. From the graph, when the width is 0 meters, the area is 0 square meters.

4. **Statement D**: "When there is no width, the area is \( 0 \mathrm{~m}^2 \)."
   - This statement is **true**. The graph clearly shows that when the width is 0 meters, the area is 0 square meters.

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
- **A**: False
- **B**: False
- **C**: False
- **D**: True

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
