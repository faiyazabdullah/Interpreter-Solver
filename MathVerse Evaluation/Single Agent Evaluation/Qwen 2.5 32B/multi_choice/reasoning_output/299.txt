### Analysis of the Problem:
The given image shows a **right isosceles triangle** where:
- The hypotenuse is labeled as 20.
- The two legs (which are equal in length) are labeled as \( x \).

We need to find the value of \( x \), rounded to the nearest tenth.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the properties of a right isosceles triangle
In a right isosceles triangle:
- The two legs are equal in length.
- The hypotenuse is related to the legs by the Pythagorean theorem:
  \[
  \text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \text{Leg}_1^2 + \text{Leg}_2^2
  \]
  Since the legs are equal (\( x \)), the formula becomes:
  \[
  \text{Hypotenuse}^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
  \]

#### Step 2: Substitute the given hypotenuse
The hypotenuse is given as 20. Substituting this into the equation:
\[
20^2 = 2x^2
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x^2 \)
Calculate \( 20^2 \):
\[
20^2 = 400
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
400 = 2x^2
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x^2 = \frac{400}{2} = 200
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \sqrt{200}
\]
Simplify \( \sqrt{200} \):
\[
\sqrt{200} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 2} = \sqrt{100} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2}
\]
Using the approximation \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \):
\[
x = 10 \cdot 1.414 = 14.14
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the nearest tenth
Rounding 14.14 to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
x \approx 14.1
\]

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is approximately 14.1. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 1.4
- B: 7.1
- C: 14.1
- D: 15.6

The closest answer is **C**.

Final Answer: C
