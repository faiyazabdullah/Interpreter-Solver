QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to measure the height AB of a pavilion (the distance from the top A to the horizontal ground BD), Xiaoming placed a step DE (DE = BC = 0.6) that is the same height as the pavilion step BC beside the pavilion, find A, B, C Three points are collinear), place a mirror horizontally at point G on the platform, and measure CG = 12.0, and then move back along the straight line CG to point E. At this time, you can see the top A of the pavilion in the mirror, and measure GE = 2.0, Xiaoming's height EF = 1.6, then the height of the pavilion AB is approximately ()

CHOICES:
A:9米
B:9.6米
C:10米
D:10.2米

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**
- We need to find the height of the pavilion, \( AB \).
- The given information includes:
  - \( DE = BC = 0.6 \) meters.
  - \( CG = 12.0 \) meters.
  - \( GE = 2.0 \) meters.
  - \( EF = 1.6 \) meters.
  - The reflection principle is used at point \( G \).

#### **Step 2: Analyze the Reflection Principle**
- According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This implies that the light ray from point \( A \) reflects off the mirror at \( G \) and reaches the observer's eye at \( F \).
- Since the light travels in straight lines before and after reflection, triangles formed by these paths will be similar due to the equal angles created by the reflection.

#### **Step 3: Identify Similar Triangles**
- The key similarity arises between triangle \( \triangle ABC \) and triangle \( \triangle FEG \):
  - \( \angle ABC = \angle FEG \) (both are vertical angles).
  - \( \angle ACB = \angle FGE \) (corresponding angles due to reflection).
  - Therefore, \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle FEG \) by AA similarity.

#### **Step 4: Set Up Proportions Using Similar Triangles**
- From the similarity \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle FEG \), we have the proportion:
  $$
  \frac{AB}{FE} = \frac{BC}{GE}
  $$
- Substituting the known values:
  - \( AB \) is the unknown height of the pavilion.
  - \( FE = 1.6 \) meters.
  - \( BC = 0.6 \) meters.
  - \( GE = 2.0 \) meters.
  $$
  \frac{AB}{1.6} = \frac{0.6}{2.0}
  $$

#### **Step 5: Solve for \( AB \)**
- Simplify the right-hand side of the proportion:
  $$
  \frac{0.6}{2.0} = 0.3
  $$
- Thus, the equation becomes:
  $$
  \frac{AB}{1.6} = 0.3
  $$
- Solve for \( AB \):
  $$
  AB = 1.6 \times 0.3 = 0.48
  $$

#### **Step 6: Consider the Total Height**
- The height \( AB \) calculated above is the height from \( B \) to \( A \). However, the problem involves the entire height of the pavilion, which includes the additional height of the platform \( BC \).
- The total height of the pavilion is:
  $$
  AB_{\text{total}} = AB + BC = 0.48 + 0.6 = 1.08 \text{ meters}.
  $$

#### **Step 7: Re-evaluate the Proportion**
- Upon re-evaluating, it appears there was an error in interpreting the problem. The correct approach should consider the entire height of the pavilion relative to the entire setup.
- Correctly, the proportion should be:
  $$
  \frac{AB}{FE} = \frac{CG}{GE}
  $$
- Substituting the values:
  $$
  \frac{AB}{1.6} = \frac{12.0}{2.0} = 6
  $$
- Solving for \( AB \):
  $$
  AB = 1.6 \times 6 = 9.6 \text{ meters}.
  $$

#### **Step 8: Final Answer**
- The height of the pavilion \( AB \) is approximately \( 9.6 \) meters.

Final Answer: B
