### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the given information and geometric relationships.
- The problem states that **AB is parallel to CD**.
- We are given that ∠B = 20°.
- We need to find the measure of ∠C.

#### Step 2: Understand the geometric properties involved.
- Since AB is parallel to CD, we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals.
- When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific relationships:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to 180°).

#### Step 3: Identify the relationship between ∠B and ∠C.
- ∠B and ∠C are **consecutive interior angles** because they are on the same side of the transversal AD and between the parallel lines AB and CD.
- Consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Therefore:
  \[
  ∠B + ∠C = 180°
  \]

#### Step 4: Substitute the given value of ∠B.
- We are given that ∠B = 20°. Substituting this into the equation:
  \[
  20° + ∠C = 180°
  \]

#### Step 5: Solve for ∠C.
- Isolate ∠C by subtracting 20° from both sides:
  \[
  ∠C = 180° - 20° = 160°
  \]

#### Step 6: Check the answer choices.
- The calculated value of ∠C is 160°. However, this does not match any of the provided answer choices (A: 40°, B: 20°, C: 60°, D: 70°).
- Upon re-evaluating the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding. Let's consider the possibility that the problem intends for us to find an alternate interpretation or a different angle relationship.

#### Step 7: Re-evaluate the problem.
- If ∠B and ∠C are alternate interior angles (which is less likely given the problem setup but worth considering), they would be equal. However, this does not align with the given information or the answer choices.
- The most plausible interpretation is that the problem involves consecutive interior angles, and the correct calculation should be rechecked.

#### Final Verification:
- The correct interpretation is that ∠B and ∠C are consecutive interior angles, and the calculation ∠C = 160° is accurate based on the given information. However, since this does not match any of the answer choices, we must conclude that the problem might have an error or an alternative context not explicitly stated.

Given the constraints and the provided answer choices, the closest logical conclusion is that the problem might involve a different angle relationship or an error in the setup. However, based on the standard geometric principles, the correct answer to the problem as stated is not among the choices.

Since the problem asks for the measure of ∠C and the closest logical answer based on the given choices is not directly derivable, we must select the closest reasonable option. However, the correct geometric solution (∠C = 160°) is not listed.

### Final Answer:
Given the constraints and the provided answer choices, the closest logical answer is not directly derivable. However, based on the standard geometric principles, the correct answer to the problem as stated is not among the choices. Therefore, the closest reasonable option is:
