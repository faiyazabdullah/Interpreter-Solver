### Analysis of the Problem:

The given graph represents the exponential function \( y = 4^x \). We need to analyze the properties of the \( y \)-values for all points on this graph.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Function \( y = 4^x \)
- The function \( y = 4^x \) is an exponential function with base 4.
- For any real number \( x \), the value of \( 4^x \) is always positive because the base 4 is a positive number greater than 1.

#### Step 2: Key Properties of Exponential Functions
1. **Domain**: The domain of \( y = 4^x \) is all real numbers (\( x \in \mathbb{R} \)).
2. **Range**: The range of \( y = 4^x \) is all positive real numbers (\( y > 0 \)). This is because any positive base raised to any real power results in a positive value.
3. **Behavior at Specific Points**:
   - When \( x = 0 \), \( y = 4^0 = 1 \).
   - As \( x \to +\infty \), \( y \to +\infty \).
   - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( y \to 0 \) (but never actually reaches 0).

#### Step 3: Analyzing the Graph
- The graph shows that the curve starts from the \( y \)-axis (as \( x \to -\infty \)), approaches but does not touch the \( x \)-axis, and rises rapidly as \( x \) increases.
- The \( y \)-value is always above the \( x \)-axis, indicating that \( y > 0 \) for all \( x \).

#### Step 4: Evaluating Each Answer Choice
- **Choice A**: "The \( y \)-value of most points of the graph is greater than 1."
  - While it is true that for \( x > 0 \), \( y > 1 \), this does not describe the behavior of the entire graph. For \( x < 0 \), \( y \) is between 0 and 1. Therefore, this statement is incomplete.

- **Choice B**: "The \( y \)-value of every point on the graph is positive."
  - This is true. Since \( 4^x > 0 \) for all real \( x \), the \( y \)-value is always positive.

- **Choice C**: "The \( y \)-value of every point on the graph is an integer."
  - This is false. The function \( y = 4^x \) produces non-integer values for most \( x \) values (e.g., \( 4^{0.5} = 2 \), \( 4^{0.25} \approx 1.414 \)).

- **Choice D**: "The \( y \)-value of most points on the graph is positive, and the \( y \)-value at one point is 0."
  - This is false. The \( y \)-value is never 0 for any real \( x \). The graph approaches the \( x \)-axis asymptotically but never touches it.

#### Final Answer:
The correct choice is **B**, as the \( y \)-value of every point on the graph is positive.

Final Answer: B
