### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a circle centered at a point that is not at the origin \((0, 0)\). The circle intersects the axes at two points, suggesting it is not centered at the origin but rather shifted in some direction. The radius of the circle appears to be 4 units, as indicated by the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 4^2\) (which represents a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin).

#### Step 2: Understand the Original Circle Equation
The equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 4^2\) represents a circle with:
- Center at \((0, 0)\)
- Radius \(r = 4\)

#### Step 3: Identify the New Circle's Position
From the image, the circle is not centered at the origin. Instead, it is shifted downward along the \(y\)-axis. The center of the circle appears to be at \((0, -4)\), as the circle is symmetric about its center and touches the \(x\)-axis at a point 4 units below the origin.

#### Step 4: Determine the Translation
To transform the original circle \(x^2 + y^2 = 4^2\) into the new circle centered at \((0, -4)\), we need to translate the circle 4 units downward. This can be achieved by replacing \(y\) with \(y + 4\) in the equation of the original circle:
\[
x^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 4^2
\]
This equation represents a circle of radius 4 centered at \((0, -4)\), which matches the position of the circle in the image.

#### Step 5: Match the Translation with the Answer Choices
The translation required to move the circle from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, -4)\) is a **4-unit downward shift**. This corresponds to option A.

#### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
