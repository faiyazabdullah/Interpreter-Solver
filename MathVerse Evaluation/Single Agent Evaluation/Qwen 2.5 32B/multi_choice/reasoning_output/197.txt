### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure involving a circle \( O \) as the circumcircle of triangle \( ABC \). The circle is tangent to \( AB \) at point \( C \), and we know the following:
- \( \angle BCE = 60^\circ \)
- \( DC = 6 \)
- \( DE = 4 \)

We need to find the area of triangle \( \triangle CDE \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- Since circle \( O \) is tangent to \( AB \) at \( C \), \( OC \) is perpendicular to \( AB \). This means \( OC \perp AB \).
- \( \angle BCE = 60^\circ \) is given.
- \( DC = 6 \) and \( DE = 4 \).

#### **Step 2: Use the Tangent-Secant Theorem**
The Tangent-Secant Theorem states that if a tangent and a secant are drawn from an external point to a circle, the square of the length of the tangent segment is equal to the product of the lengths of the secant segment and its external part. However, in this problem, we do not directly use this theorem but focus on the given lengths and angles.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Area of \( \triangle CDE \)**
To find the area of \( \triangle CDE \), we use the formula for the area of a triangle when two sides and the included angle are known:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot b \cdot \sin(\theta)
\]
where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of two sides, and \( \theta \) is the included angle.

Here:
- \( a = DC = 6 \)
- \( b = DE = 4 \)
- \( \theta = \angle CDE \)

#### **Step 4: Determine \( \angle CDE \)**
Since \( \angle BCE = 60^\circ \) and \( C \) is the point of tangency, the angle \( \angle DCE \) is part of the cyclic quadrilateral formed by the circle. However, we can directly use the given angle \( \angle BCE = 60^\circ \) as it helps us determine the configuration of the triangle.

#### **Step 5: Apply the Formula**
Using the formula for the area:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot DC \cdot DE \cdot \sin(\angle CDE)
\]
We need to find \( \sin(\angle CDE) \). Since \( \angle BCE = 60^\circ \), and considering the geometry of the circle and the tangent, we can infer that \( \angle CDE = 90^\circ - \angle BCE = 30^\circ \).

However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the configuration allows us to use the given angle directly. Since \( \angle BCE = 60^\circ \), we can use the sine of \( 60^\circ \):
\[
\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 4 \cdot \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6 \cdot 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 6 \sqrt{3}
\]

#### **Step 6: Match with Answer Choices**
The calculated area is \( 6\sqrt{3} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
