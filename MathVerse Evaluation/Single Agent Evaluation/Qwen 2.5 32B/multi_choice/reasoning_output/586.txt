QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (0,0) and the value of y increases by the increase of the value of x, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Graph
The provided graph shows a continuous curve that passes through the origin \((0, 0)\). The curve is strictly increasing, meaning as \(x\) increases, \(y\) also increases. This can be observed from the fact that the curve moves upward as we move to the right along the \(x\)-axis.

#### Step 2: Understand Key Properties
- **Passing through the origin**: The curve passes through the point \((0, 0)\).
- **Strictly increasing**: For every increase in \(x\), there is a corresponding increase in \(y\). This implies that the function is one-to-one (injective).

#### Step 3: Determine the Existence of an Inverse Function
A function has an inverse if and only if it is **one-to-one** (injective) and **onto** (surjective). However, for a continuous graph like the one provided, we primarily focus on whether the function is one-to-one. If the function is one-to-one, then it will have an inverse.

- **One-to-One Property**: A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. From the graph, it is clear that no horizontal line intersects the curve more than once. This confirms that the function is one-to-one.
- **Strictly Increasing**: Since the function is strictly increasing, it is automatically one-to-one.

#### Step 4: Conclusion
Since the function is strictly increasing and one-to-one, it satisfies the necessary condition for having an inverse function.
