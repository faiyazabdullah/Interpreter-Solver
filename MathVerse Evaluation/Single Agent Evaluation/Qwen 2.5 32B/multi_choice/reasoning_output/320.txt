QUESTION:
The figure shows a quadrilateral ABCD, with S on AC and T on BD. For trapezoid A B C D, S and T are midpoints of the legs. If A B = x + 4, C D = 3 x + 2, and S T = 9, find A B.

CHOICES:
A:3
B:5
C:7
D:9

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- The figure is a trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(AB \parallel CD\).
- \(S\) is the midpoint of \(AD\), and \(T\) is the midpoint of \(BC\).
- The lengths are given as:
  - \(AB = x + 4\)
  - \(CD = 3x + 2\)
  - The length of the midsegment \(ST\) is \(9\).

#### **Step 2: Use the Midsegment Theorem for Trapezoids**
The Midsegment Theorem states that the length of the midsegment (\(ST\)) of a trapezoid is the average of the lengths of the two parallel sides (\(AB\) and \(CD\)). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
ST = \frac{AB + CD}{2}
\]

#### **Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula**
We know:
- \(ST = 9\)
- \(AB = x + 4\)
- \(CD = 3x + 2\)

Substitute these into the Midsegment Theorem formula:
\[
9 = \frac{(x + 4) + (3x + 2)}{2}
\]

#### **Step 4: Simplify the equation**
First, combine like terms inside the parentheses:
\[
(x + 4) + (3x + 2) = 4x + 6
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
9 = \frac{4x + 6}{2}
\]

Next, eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
9 \cdot 2 = 4x + 6
\]
\[
18 = 4x + 6
\]

#### **Step 5: Solve for \(x\)** 
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
18 - 6 = 4x
\]
\[
12 = 4x
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
x = 3
\]

#### **Step 6: Find the length of \(AB\)** 
Now that we have \(x = 3\), substitute \(x\) back into the expression for \(AB\):
\[
AB = x + 4
\]
\[
AB = 3 + 4
\]
\[
AB = 7
\]

#### **Step 7: Match the result with the answer choices**
The length of \(AB\) is \(7\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 3
- B: 5
- C: 7
- D: 9

The correct answer is \(C\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
