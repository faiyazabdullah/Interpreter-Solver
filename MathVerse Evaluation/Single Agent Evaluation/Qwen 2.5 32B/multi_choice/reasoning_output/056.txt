### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information and identify key elements**
- The figure shows a circle with center \( O \).
- \( CD \) is the diameter of the circle.
- \( G \) is the midpoint of the chord \( EF \), meaning \( G \) lies on the diameter \( CD \) and divides \( EF \) into two equal parts: \( EG = GF \).
- \( \angle DCF = 20^\circ \).

We need to find \( \angle EOD \).

#### **Step 2: Use geometric properties and theorems**
1. **Perpendicularity property**: Since \( G \) is the midpoint of the chord \( EF \) and \( CD \) is the diameter, the diameter \( CD \) is perpendicular to the chord \( EF \). Therefore, \( CD \perp EF \).

2. **Angle subtended by a chord**: The angle subtended by a chord at the center of the circle is twice the angle subtended by the same chord at any point on the circumference. This is a key property we will use.

3. **Identify relevant angles**:
   - \( \angle DCF = 20^\circ \) is given.
   - Since \( CD \) is the diameter, \( \angle DCF \) is an angle formed by the radius \( CF \) and the diameter \( CD \).

#### **Step 3: Relate \( \angle DCF \) to central angle \( \angle EOD \)**
- The angle \( \angle DCF \) is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc \( DF \).
- The central angle \( \angle EOF \) (which is the same as \( \angle EOD \) since \( O \) is the center) subtends the same arc \( DF \).
- By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle. Therefore:
  \[
  \angle EOD = 2 \times \angle DCF
  \]

#### **Step 4: Calculate \( \angle EOD \)**
- Given \( \angle DCF = 20^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle EOD = 2 \times 20^\circ = 40^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 5: Verify the result**
- The calculation is consistent with the Inscribed Angle Theorem, and all geometric relationships are satisfied.

#### **Step 6: Match the result with the answer choices**
- The calculated value of \( \angle EOD \) is \( 40^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
