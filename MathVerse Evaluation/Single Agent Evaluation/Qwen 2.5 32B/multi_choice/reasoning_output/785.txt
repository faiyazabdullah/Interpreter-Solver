### Analysis and Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the problem and given information
- The shaded polygon is described as having **equal sides and equal angles**, meaning it is a **regular polygon**.
- A portion of the polygon is covered by a sheet of paper, leaving only a quadrilateral visible.
- The quadrilateral shows two exterior angles labeled as \( x^\circ \) and \( y^\circ \).
- It is given that \( x + y = 80 \).

#### Step 2: Relate the exterior angles to the interior angles
- In a regular polygon, each interior angle is related to the number of sides \( n \) by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Interior angle} = \frac{(n-2) \cdot 180^\circ}{n}
  \]
- Each exterior angle of a regular polygon is supplementary to its corresponding interior angle. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Exterior angle} = 180^\circ - \text{Interior angle}
  \]
- Since the polygon is regular, all exterior angles are equal. Let the measure of each exterior angle be \( \theta \). Then:
  \[
  \theta = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
  \]

#### Step 3: Analyze the visible quadrilateral
- The quadrilateral shows two exterior angles \( x \) and \( y \). These angles are part of the exterior angles of the regular polygon.
- Since the polygon is regular, the sum of the exterior angles around the entire polygon is always \( 360^\circ \). The visible quadrilateral reveals two exterior angles \( x \) and \( y \), but they are not necessarily adjacent in the polygon. However, their sum is given as:
  \[
  x + y = 80
  \]

#### Step 4: Relate \( x + y \) to the total exterior angles
- In a regular polygon, the sum of all exterior angles is \( 360^\circ \). If the polygon has \( n \) sides, each exterior angle is \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \).
- The visible quadrilateral shows two exterior angles \( x \) and \( y \), but these angles are part of the overall distribution of exterior angles. The key is to use the relationship between the exterior angles and the number of sides.

#### Step 5: Use the property of regular polygons
- For a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, the measure of each exterior angle is:
  \[
  \theta = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
  \]
- Since \( x \) and \( y \) are exterior angles of the polygon, and their sum is \( 80^\circ \), we need to consider how these angles relate to the total exterior angles. However, the critical insight is that the sum of the exterior angles around the polygon is always \( 360^\circ \), and the given \( x + y = 80 \) helps us find \( n \).

#### Step 6: Solve for \( n \)
- The sum of the exterior angles of the polygon is \( 360^\circ \). If \( x + y = 80 \), then the remaining exterior angles must sum to:
  \[
  360^\circ - 80^\circ = 280^\circ
  \]
- Since the polygon is regular, all exterior angles are equal. Let the measure of each exterior angle be \( \theta \). Then:
  \[
  \theta = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
  \]
- The sum of the exterior angles is distributed among \( n \) sides. Given \( x + y = 80 \), we can infer that the number of sides \( n \) must satisfy the condition that the exterior angles are evenly distributed. Solving for \( n \):
  \[
  \frac{360^\circ}{n} = \theta
  \]
  Since \( x + y = 80 \) represents a fraction of the total exterior angles, we can set up the equation:
  \[
  n \cdot \theta = 360^\circ
  \]
  Substituting \( \theta = \frac{360^\circ}{n} \):
  \[
  n \cdot \frac{360^\circ}{n} = 360^\circ
  \]
  This confirms the consistency of the relationship. To find \( n \), we use the fact that the sum of the exterior angles is \( 360^\circ \) and the given \( x + y = 80 \) helps us deduce:
  \[
  n = \frac{360^\circ}{\theta}
  \]
  Since \( x + y = 80 \) represents a portion of the total exterior angles, we solve:
  \[
  n = 9
  \]

#### Step 7: Verify the solution
- If \( n = 9 \), then each exterior angle is:
  \[
  \theta = \frac{360^\circ}{9} = 40^\circ
  \]
- The sum of two exterior angles \( x + y = 80^\circ \) is consistent with the fact that each exterior angle is \( 40^\circ \), and the polygon has 9 sides.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
