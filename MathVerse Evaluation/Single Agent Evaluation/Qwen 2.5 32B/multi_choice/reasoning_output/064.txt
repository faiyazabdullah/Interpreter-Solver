### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We are given a cylindrical oil tank with a diameter of 200 cm. The cross-section of the tank shows the oil surface as a chord \( AB \) with a length of 160 cm. We need to find the **maximum depth** of the oil, which corresponds to the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle (the top of the tank) to the oil surface.

#### **Step 2: Identify Key Information**
- Diameter of the cylinder: \( 200 \) cm.
- Radius of the cylinder: \( r = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \) cm.
- Length of the chord \( AB \): \( 160 \) cm.
- The maximum depth of the oil is the perpendicular distance from the center \( O \) of the circle to the chord \( AB \).

#### **Step 3: Use Geometric Properties**
In a circle, the perpendicular from the center of the circle to a chord bisects the chord. Let \( M \) be the midpoint of \( AB \). Then:
- \( AM = MB = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{160}{2} = 80 \) cm.
- \( OM \) is the perpendicular distance from the center \( O \) to the chord \( AB \).

#### **Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
In the right triangle \( OMA \):
- \( OA \) is the radius of the circle: \( OA = 100 \) cm.
- \( AM = 80 \) cm.
- \( OM \) is the unknown we need to find.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OMA \):
\[
OA^2 = OM^2 + AM^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
100^2 = OM^2 + 80^2
\]
\[
10000 = OM^2 + 6400
\]
Solve for \( OM^2 \):
\[
OM^2 = 10000 - 6400
\]
\[
OM^2 = 3600
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
OM = \sqrt{3600} = 60 \text{ cm}
\]

#### **Step 5: Interpret the Result**
The value \( OM = 60 \) cm represents the distance from the center \( O \) to the chord \( AB \). Since the radius of the circle is 100 cm, the maximum depth of the oil is the distance from the top of the tank (center \( O \)) to the oil surface, which is \( 100 - OM \):
\[
\text{Maximum depth} = 100 - 60 = 40 \text{ cm}
\]

#### **Step 6: Match with Answer Choices**
The maximum depth of the oil is \( 40 \) cm. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 40 cm
- B: 60 cm
- C: 80 cm
- D: 100 cm

The correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
