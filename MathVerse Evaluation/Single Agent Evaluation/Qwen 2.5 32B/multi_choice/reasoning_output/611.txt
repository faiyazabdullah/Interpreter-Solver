QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What does the average rate of change tell you?

CHOICES:
A:The number of earthquakes per year increased by 6 each year.
B:The number of earthquakes per year did not change.
C:There were a total of 6 earthquakes over the 4 years.
D:The number of earthquakes per year decreased by 6 each year.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given graph step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Graph
- The **x-axis** represents the **years**, ranging from 0 to 4.
- The **y-axis** represents the **number of earthquakes**, ranging from 0 to 10.
- The graph shows a horizontal line at **y = 6** for all years (from year 0 to year 4).

### Step 2: Interpret the Data
- The graph indicates that the number of earthquakes remains constant at **6** for each year.
- There is no upward or downward trend; the line is perfectly flat.

### Step 3: Calculate the Average Rate of Change
The **average rate of change** is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
\]
where:
- \(\Delta y\) is the change in the number of earthquakes.
- \(\Delta x\) is the change in time (years).

From the graph:
- The number of earthquakes (\(y\)) does not change over time. Therefore, \(\Delta y = 0\).
- The change in time (\(\Delta x\)) can be any interval between two years (e.g., from year 1 to year 2, or from year 0 to year 4).

Since \(\Delta y = 0\) for any interval, the average rate of change is:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{0}{\Delta x} = 0
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the Answer Choices
- **A**: "The number of earthquakes per year increased by 6 each year."
  - This is incorrect because the number of earthquakes does not increase; it remains constant.
  
- **B**: "The number of earthquakes per year did not change."
  - This is correct because the graph shows a constant value of 6 earthquakes per year, with no change over time.
  
- **C**: "There were a total of 6 earthquakes over the 4 years."
  - This is incorrect because the graph shows 6 earthquakes **per year**, not a total of 6 over 4 years. Over 4 years, there would be \(6 \times 4 = 24\) earthquakes.
  
- **D**: "The number of earthquakes per year decreased by 6 each year."
  - This is incorrect because the number of earthquakes does not decrease; it remains constant.

### Final Answer:
The correct interpretation is that the number of earthquakes per year did not change.

Final Answer: B
