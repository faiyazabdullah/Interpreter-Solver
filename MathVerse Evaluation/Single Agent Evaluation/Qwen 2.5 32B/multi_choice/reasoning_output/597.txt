### Analysis of the Problem:

We are tasked with determining the number of solutions to the system of equations:
1. \( x^2 + y^2 = 9 \)
2. \( y = x^2 - 4 \)

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Representations
- The equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 9 \) represents a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a radius of 3.
- The equation \( y = x^2 - 4 \) represents a parabola that opens upwards, with its vertex at \((0, -4)\).

#### Step 2: Visual Interpretation from the Graph
From the provided graph:
- The circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 9 \) is a standard circle centered at the origin with radius 3.
- The parabola \( y = x^2 - 4 \) intersects the circle at multiple points. The intersections are visually identified as the points where the parabola crosses the circle.

#### Step 3: Algebraic Approach to Find Intersections
To find the points of intersection, substitute \( y = x^2 - 4 \) into the circle's equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 9 \):
\[
x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = 9
\]

#### Step 4: Simplify the Equation
Expand and simplify the equation:
\[
x^2 + (x^2 - 4)^2 = 9
\]
\[
x^2 + (x^4 - 8x^2 + 16) = 9
\]
\[
x^4 - 7x^2 + 16 = 9
\]
\[
x^4 - 7x^2 + 7 = 0
\]

Let \( z = x^2 \). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in \( z \):
\[
z^2 - 7z + 7 = 0
\]

#### Step 5: Solve the Quadratic Equation
Use the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -7 \), and \( c = 7 \):
\[
z = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(7)}}{2(1)}
\]
\[
z = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 - 28}}{2}
\]
\[
z = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{21}}{2}
\]

Thus, the solutions for \( z \) are:
\[
z = \frac{7 + \sqrt{21}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad z = \frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2}
\]

Since \( z = x^2 \), we have:
\[
x^2 = \frac{7 + \sqrt{21}}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = \frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2}
\]

#### Step 6: Determine Valid Solutions for \( x \)
- For \( x^2 = \frac{7 + \sqrt{21}}{2} \):
  Since \( \frac{7 + \sqrt{21}}{2} > 9 \) (the square of the radius of the circle), there are no real solutions for \( x \) in this case.

- For \( x^2 = \frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2} \):
  Since \( \frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2} < 9 \), this value is valid. Therefore, \( x \) can take two values:
  \[
  x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2}}
  \]

For each value of \( x \), we can find the corresponding \( y \) using \( y = x^2 - 4 \):
\[
y = \left( \sqrt{\frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2}} \right)^2 - 4 = \frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2} - 4 = \frac{7 - \sqrt{21} - 8}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{21}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \left( -\sqrt{\frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2}} \right)^2 - 4 = \frac{7 - \sqrt{21}}{2} - 4 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{21}}{2}
\]

Thus, there are exactly **two distinct points of intersection**.

#### Step 7: Verify with the Graph
From the graph, we observe that the parabola intersects the circle at exactly two points. This confirms our algebraic solution.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
