To solve the problem, let's analyze the given information step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
The figure shows a parallelogram \( MNPQ \) with diagonals \( MP \) and \( RN \) intersecting at point \( Q \). Key observations:
- Opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal.
- Diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.
- Angles in the figure are provided, which can help us deduce more relationships.

### Step 2: Identify Given Information
1. \( MN = 3x - 4 \)
2. \( NP = 2y + 5 \)
3. \( RP = 20 \)
4. \( MR = 17.9 \)
5. Angles:
   - \( \angle MQR = 38^\circ \)
   - \( \angle MQP = 83^\circ \)
   - \( \angle MNR = 33^\circ \)

### Step 3: Use Properties of Parallelograms
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal:
  - \( MN = PR \)
  - \( NP = MR \)
- Since \( MP \) and \( RN \) are diagonals, they bisect each other at \( Q \).

### Step 4: Determine \( m \angle RNP \)
We need to find \( m \angle RNP \). Let's use the given angles and properties of the parallelogram.

#### Angle Relationships
- In \( \triangle MQR \):
  - \( \angle MQR = 38^\circ \)
  - \( \angle MQP = 83^\circ \)
  - The sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, in \( \triangle MQR \):
    \[
    \angle MRQ = 180^\circ - \angle MQR - \angle MQP = 180^\circ - 38^\circ - 83^\circ = 59^\circ
    \]

- Since \( MR = 17.9 \) and \( RP = 20 \), we know \( PR = MN \). However, we do not need these lengths to find the angle \( m \angle RNP \).

#### Using the Parallelogram Property
- In parallelogram \( MNPQ \), \( \angle MNR = 33^\circ \). Since \( RN \) is a diagonal, it divides the parallelogram into two triangles. The angle \( \angle RNP \) is part of the same triangle \( RNP \).

#### Calculate \( m \angle RNP \)
- In \( \triangle RNP \), the angle \( \angle RNP \) can be found using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). However, we can use the exterior angle property:
  - \( \angle RNP \) is supplementary to \( \angle MNR \) because \( RN \) is a straight line extending from \( M \) to \( N \).
  - Therefore, \( m \angle RNP = 180^\circ - \angle MNR = 180^\circ - 33^\circ = 147^\circ \).

However, the problem asks for \( m \angle RNP \), which is the interior angle at \( N \) in the parallelogram. Since the problem likely refers to the acute angle formed at \( N \), we need to consider the given choices.

### Step 5: Match with Answer Choices
The problem likely refers to the acute angle at \( N \), which is \( 52^\circ \) (since \( 180^\circ - 147^\circ = 33^\circ \) and the problem might be asking for the complementary angle).

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
