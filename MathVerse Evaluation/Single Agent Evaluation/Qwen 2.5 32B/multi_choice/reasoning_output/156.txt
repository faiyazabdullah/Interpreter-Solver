### Problem Analysis:
We are given two similar quadrilaterals, \(ABCD\) and \(A'B'C'D'\), with the similarity center at point \(O\). The ratio of the segments \(OA': A'A\) is given as \(2:1\). The area of the smaller quadrilateral \(A'B'C'D'\) is \(12 \, \text{cm}^2\), and we need to find the area of the larger quadrilateral \(ABCD\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Similarity Ratio**
The ratio \(OA': A'A = 2:1\) implies that the total length \(OA\) is the sum of \(OA'\) and \(A'A\):
\[
OA = OA' + A'A
\]
Given \(OA': A'A = 2:1\), let \(A'A = x\). Then \(OA' = 2x\), and:
\[
OA = OA' + A'A = 2x + x = 3x
\]
Thus, the ratio of the corresponding sides of the similar figures is:
\[
\frac{OA}{OA'} = \frac{3x}{2x} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

#### **Step 2: Relationship Between Areas of Similar Figures**
For similar figures, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Let the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) be \(A_{ABCD}\) and the area of quadrilateral \(A'B'C'D'\) be \(A_{A'B'C'D'}\). The relationship is:
\[
\frac{A_{ABCD}}{A_{A'B'C'D'}} = \left(\frac{\text{side length of } ABCD}{\text{side length of } A'B'C'D'}\right)^2
\]
From the similarity ratio, the side length ratio is \(3:2\). Therefore:
\[
\frac{A_{ABCD}}{A_{A'B'C'D'}} = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{4}
\]

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Area of \(ABCD\)**
We are given that the area of \(A'B'C'D'\) is \(12 \, \text{cm}^2\). Using the area ratio:
\[
\frac{A_{ABCD}}{12} = \frac{9}{4}
\]
Solving for \(A_{ABCD}\):
\[
A_{ABCD} = 12 \times \frac{9}{4} = 12 \times 2.25 = 27 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
