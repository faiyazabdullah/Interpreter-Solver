### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the value of the angle \( x \) in the given geometric figure. The figure consists of a straight line intersecting two other lines, forming several angles. The key angles provided are \( 55^\circ \) and \( 75^\circ \). We need to use geometric principles to determine the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Two angles are explicitly given: \( 55^\circ \) and \( 75^\circ \).
   - These angles are adjacent to each other on a straight line.
   - The angle \( x \) is part of a triangle formed by the intersection of the lines.

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles:**
   - The sum of angles on a straight line is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, the angle adjacent to \( 55^\circ \) on the straight line is:
     \[
     180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
     \]
   - Similarly, the angle adjacent to \( 75^\circ \) on the same straight line is:
     \[
     180^\circ - 75^\circ = 105^\circ
     \]

3. **Focus on the triangle:**
   - The triangle formed by the intersecting lines has three angles:
     - One angle is \( 125^\circ \) (adjacent to \( 55^\circ \)).
     - Another angle is \( 105^\circ \) (adjacent to \( 75^\circ \)).
     - The third angle is \( x \).

4. **Use the triangle angle sum property:**
   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). Therefore:
     \[
     125^\circ + 105^\circ + x = 180^\circ
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     125^\circ + 105^\circ = 230^\circ
     \]
     \[
     230^\circ + x = 180^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = 180^\circ - 230^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = -50^\circ
     \]

   - Since we made an error in interpreting the angles, let's re-evaluate the setup. The correct approach is to consider the external angles formed by the intersecting lines.

6. **Re-evaluate using external angles:**
   - The external angle \( x \) is actually the supplement of the sum of the internal angles adjacent to it. The correct setup should be:
     \[
     x = 180^\circ - (55^\circ + 75^\circ)
     \]
     \[
     x = 180^\circ - 130^\circ
     \]
     \[
     x = 50^\circ
     \]

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 50^\circ \).
