QUESTION:
The figure shows three parallel horizontal lines, with a diagonal line running through them on the left and a vertical line on the right. The diagonal line on the left intersects with three horizontal lines, with a length of 2x+6 for the lower section and 20-5x for the upper section. The vertical line on the right intersects with three horizontal lines, with a length of y for the upper section and 3/5y+2 for the lower section. The two short line segments cut by the left line are of equal length, and the two short line segments cut by the right line are of equal lengthFind y.

CHOICES:
A:3
B:4.5
C:5
D:6

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The image shows three parallel horizontal lines intersected by a diagonal line on the left and a vertical line on the right. The diagonal line divides the segments into two parts:  
- Lower segment: $ 2x + 6 $  
- Upper segment: $ 20 - 5x $

The vertical line divides the segments into two parts:  
- Upper segment: $ y $  
- Lower segment: $ \frac{3}{5}y + 2 $

We are told that the two short line segments cut by the diagonal line are equal in length, and the two short line segments cut by the vertical line are also equal in length. Our goal is to find the value of $ y $.

#### **Step 2: Use the Proportionality Property of Parallel Lines**
When a transversal intersects multiple parallel lines, the segments created are proportional. This means the ratios of the segments on one transversal are equal to the ratios of the corresponding segments on another transversal.

For the diagonal line:
$$
\frac{\text{Upper segment}}{\text{Lower segment}} = \frac{20 - 5x}{2x + 6}
$$

For the vertical line:
$$
\frac{\text{Upper segment}}{\text{Lower segment}} = \frac{y}{\frac{3}{5}y + 2}
$$

Since the two transversals (diagonal and vertical) intersect the same set of parallel lines, the ratios must be equal:
$$
\frac{20 - 5x}{2x + 6} = \frac{y}{\frac{3}{5}y + 2}
$$

---

#### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $ Using the Diagonal Line**
The problem states that the two short segments cut by the diagonal line are equal. This implies:
$$
2x + 6 = 20 - 5x
$$

Solve for $ x $:
$$
2x + 5x = 20 - 6
$$
$$
7x = 14
$$
$$
x = 2
$$

---

#### **Step 4: Substitute $ x = 2 $ into the Ratio for the Diagonal Line**
Substitute $ x = 2 $ into the expression for the diagonal line:
$$
2x + 6 = 2(2) + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10
$$
$$
20 - 5x = 20 - 5(2) = 20 - 10 = 10
$$

Thus, the ratio for the diagonal line is:
$$
\frac{20 - 5x}{2x + 6} = \frac{10}{10} = 1
$$

---

#### **Step 5: Use the Vertical Line's Ratio**
The ratio for the vertical line is:
$$
\frac{y}{\frac{3}{5}y + 2}
$$

Since the ratios are equal:
$$
\frac{y}{\frac{3}{5}y + 2} = 1
$$

This implies:
$$
y = \frac{3}{5}y + 2
$$

Solve for $ y $:
$$
y - \frac{3}{5}y = 2
$$
$$
\frac{5}{5}y - \frac{3}{5}y = 2
$$
$$
\frac{2}{5}y = 2
$$
$$
y = 2 \cdot \frac{5}{2}
$$
$$
y = 5
$$

---

#### **Step 6: Verify the Solution**
Substitute $ y = 5 $ back into the expressions:
- For the vertical line:
  $$
  \frac{3}{5}y + 2 = \frac{3}{5}(5) + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5
  $$
  The segments are equal, confirming the solution.

#### **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{C}
$$
