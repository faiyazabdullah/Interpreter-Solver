### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a curve plotted on a Cartesian coordinate system. The curve passes through the points \((-2, 0)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\). The curve appears to have a general shape that rises and falls, crossing the x-axis at these three points.

#### Step 2: Understand the Vertical Line Test
The **vertical line test** is used to determine whether a given graph represents a function. According to this test:
- If any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, the graph does not represent a function.
- If every vertical line intersects the graph at most once, the graph represents a function.

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine whether the given curve satisfies the vertical line test. Specifically, we need to check if there exists any vertical line that intersects the curve at more than one point.

#### Step 4: Apply the Vertical Line Test
- **Visual Inspection**: From the image, observe the behavior of the curve:
  - The curve crosses the x-axis at three points: \((-2, 0)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
  - Between these points, the curve rises and falls, but it does not appear to intersect itself vertically anywhere. This means that for any vertical line drawn, it will intersect the curve at most once.
  
- **Key Observation**: The curve does not loop back on itself or create any vertical overlaps. Each vertical line will pass through the curve at most once.

#### Step 5: Show Calculations (if applicable)
No explicit calculations are needed here since the problem relies on visual inspection and the application of the vertical line test. However, the key observation is that no vertical line can intersect the curve at more than one point.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
Based on the vertical line test, the curve satisfies the condition of being a function. Therefore, the correct answer is that this relation is a function.

### Final Answer:
