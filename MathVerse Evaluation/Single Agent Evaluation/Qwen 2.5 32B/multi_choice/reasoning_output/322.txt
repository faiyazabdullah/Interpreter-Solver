### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- $ QM \perp MN $ (QM is perpendicular to MN),
- $ QP \perp NP $ (QP is perpendicular to NP),
- The length of $ MQ = 2x + 2 $,
- The length of $ QP = 4x - 8 $,
- $ NQ $ is the angular bisector of $ \angle MNP $.

We need to find the length of $ QM $, which is represented as $ 2x + 2 $.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
Since $ QM \perp MN $ and $ QP \perp NP $, triangles $ \triangle MQN $ and $ \triangle PQN $ are right triangles sharing the common side $ NQ $. The key property here is that $ NQ $ is the angular bisector of $ \angle MNP $. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the angular bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

#### **Step 2: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem**
The Angle Bisector Theorem states that if a point $ Q $ lies on the angular bisector of $ \angle MNP $, then:
\[
\frac{MQ}{QP} = \frac{MN}{NP}
\]
However, we do not have the lengths of $ MN $ and $ NP $. Instead, we can use the fact that the angular bisector creates similar triangles in terms of proportions.

#### **Step 3: Use the Perpendicular Distances**
Since $ QM $ and $ QP $ are perpendicular distances from $ Q $ to the sides $ MN $ and $ NP $ respectively, and $ NQ $ is the angular bisector, the distances $ MQ $ and $ QP $ must satisfy a specific relationship due to the symmetry created by the angular bisector. Specifically, the lengths $ MQ $ and $ QP $ should be equal because the angular bisector divides the triangle into two smaller triangles with proportional sides, and the perpendicular distances from the vertex to the sides are equal in such cases.

Thus, we set up the equation:
\[
MQ = QP
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
Substitute the given expressions for $ MQ $ and $ QP $:
\[
2x + 2 = 4x - 8
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
2x + 2 = 4x - 8
\]
\[
2 + 8 = 4x - 2x
\]
\[
10 = 2x
\]
\[
x = 5
\]

#### **Step 5: Find the Length of \( QM \)**
Now that we have \( x = 5 \), substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( MQ \):
\[
MQ = 2x + 2 = 2(5) + 2 = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

#### **Step 6: Verify the Answer**
We have determined that \( MQ = 12 \). This matches one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
