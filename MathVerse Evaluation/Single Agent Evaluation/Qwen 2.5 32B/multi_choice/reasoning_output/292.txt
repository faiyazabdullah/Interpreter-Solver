### Analysis of the Problem:
The given image shows a right triangle with:
- One acute angle measuring \(70^\circ\).
- The side opposite the \(70^\circ\) angle (the perpendicular) is 15 units.
- The hypotenuse is labeled as \(x\).

We need to find the length of the hypotenuse \(x\) to the nearest hundredth.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify the relevant trigonometric relationship**
In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, the angle \(\theta = 70^\circ\), the opposite side is 15, and the hypotenuse is \(x\). Thus:
\[
\sin(70^\circ) = \frac{15}{x}
\]

#### **Step 2: Solve for \(x\)** 
Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
\[
x = \frac{15}{\sin(70^\circ)}
\]

#### **Step 3: Calculate \(\sin(70^\circ)\)**
Using a calculator:
\[
\sin(70^\circ) \approx 0.9397
\]

#### **Step 4: Substitute and compute \(x\)** 
Substitute \(\sin(70^\circ) \approx 0.9397\) into the equation:
\[
x = \frac{15}{0.9397} \approx 15.96
\]

#### **Step 5: Round to the nearest hundredth**
The value of \(x\) is approximately 15.96 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

### Final Answer:
Compare the calculated value with the given answer choices:
- A: 5.13
- B: 5.46
- C: 15.96
- D: 43.86

The closest value is \(15.96\), which matches choice C.

Final Answer: C
