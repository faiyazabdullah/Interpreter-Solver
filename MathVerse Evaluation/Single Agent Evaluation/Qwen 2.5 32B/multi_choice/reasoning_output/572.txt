QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex of (-8,8). f(x)=-5(x+4)^2+8. Which function has a greater maximum?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ has a greater maximum than $g$.
B:$g$ has a greater maximum than $f$.
C:$f$ and $g$ share the same maximum.

====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the functions and their maximum values step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given functions
- **Function \( g(x) \)**: 
  - The graph shows a quadratic function that opens downward.
  - The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \( (-8, 8) \).
  - Since the vertex is the highest point for a downward-opening parabola, the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 8.

- **Function \( f(x) \)**:
  - The function is given explicitly as \( f(x) = -5(x + 4)^2 + 8 \).
  - This is also a quadratic function in vertex form \( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where:
    - \( a = -5 \) (indicating the parabola opens downward),
    - \( h = -4 \) (the x-coordinate of the vertex),
    - \( k = 8 \) (the y-coordinate of the vertex).
  - Therefore, the vertex of \( f(x) \) is at \( (-4, 8) \).
  - Since the vertex is the highest point for a downward-opening parabola, the maximum value of \( f(x) \) is 8.

### Step 2: Compare the maximum values
- The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 8.
- The maximum value of \( f(x) \) is also 8.

Since both functions have the same maximum value, we conclude that \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) share the same maximum.
