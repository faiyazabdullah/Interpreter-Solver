### Analysis of the Problem:
The question asks us to use the **vertical line test** to determine whether the given curve is the graph of a function. Let's follow the solution steps:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a curve that appears to be continuous but has multiple branches. It intersects the vertical axis at least twice in different regions of the plane.

#### Step 2: Understand the Vertical Line Test
The vertical line test is a method used to determine whether a given graph represents a function. According to this test:
- If any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, the graph does **not** represent a function.
- If every vertical line intersects the graph at most once, the graph does represent a function.

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine whether the given curve passes the vertical line test. Specifically, we check if there exists any vertical line that intersects the curve at more than one point.

#### Step 4: Apply the Vertical Line Test
From the image:
1. Consider a vertical line passing through the y-axis (e.g., the line \( x = 0 \)).
2. Observe that this vertical line intersects the curve at two distinct points: one in the upper region and one in the lower region.
3. Since a single vertical line intersects the curve at more than one point, the curve fails the vertical line test.

#### Step 5: Show Calculations (if applicable)
No explicit calculations are needed here, as the visual inspection of the curve is sufficient to determine that it fails the vertical line test.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
Based on the vertical line test, the curve is **not** the graph of a function. Therefore, the correct answer is:
