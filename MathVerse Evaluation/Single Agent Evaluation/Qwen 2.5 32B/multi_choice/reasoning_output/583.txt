QUESTION:
Do the following graph, a line which passes (-6,0) and (0,2) and the slope of the line > 0, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given information step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are given:
1. A line passing through the points \((-6, 0)\) and \((0, 2)\).
2. The slope of the line is positive.
3. We need to determine whether the function representing this line has an **inverse function**.

### Step 2: Find the Equation of the Line
The general form of a linear equation is:
\[ y = mx + b \]
where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

#### Calculate the Slope (\( m \))
The slope \( m \) is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]
Substitute the points \((-6, 0)\) and \((0, 2)\):
\[ m = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-6)} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]

So, the slope \( m = \frac{1}{3} \).

#### Find the Y-Intercept (\( b \))
Using the point-slope form and substituting one of the points, say \((0, 2)\):
\[ y = mx + b \]
\[ 2 = \frac{1}{3}(0) + b \]
\[ b = 2 \]

Thus, the equation of the line is:
\[ y = \frac{1}{3}x + 2 \]

### Step 3: Determine If the Function Has an Inverse
For a function to have an inverse, it must be **one-to-one**. A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. This is known as the **Horizontal Line Test**.

#### Check the Slope
The slope of the line is \( \frac{1}{3} \), which is positive. A line with a positive slope is strictly increasing, meaning it passes the Horizontal Line Test. Therefore, the function is one-to-one.

#### Conclusion
Since the function is one-to-one, it has an inverse.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
