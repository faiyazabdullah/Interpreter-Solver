### Analysis of the Problem

We are tasked with finding the length of \( BQ \) in triangle \( ABC \), where \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \) are medians that intersect at point \( Q \). It is given that \( Q \) is the centroid of the triangle, and \( BE = 9 \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Centroid
The centroid \( Q \) of a triangle is the point where the medians intersect. A key property of the centroid is that it divides each median into two segments in the ratio \( 2:1 \). Specifically:
- The segment from the vertex to the centroid is twice as long as the segment from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side.

#### Step 2: Applying the Centroid Property
Given:
- \( BE \) is a median.
- \( Q \) is the centroid.
- \( BE = 9 \).

By the centroid property, the segment \( BQ \) (from the vertex \( B \) to the centroid \( Q \)) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the total length of the median \( BE \). The remaining segment \( QE \) (from the centroid \( Q \) to the midpoint \( E \)) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total length of the median \( BE \).

#### Step 3: Calculating \( BQ \)
Using the ratio \( BQ : QE = 2 : 1 \):
\[
BQ = \frac{2}{3} \times BE
\]
Substitute \( BE = 9 \):
\[
BQ = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
\]

#### Step 4: Verifying the Answer
The calculation confirms that \( BQ = 6 \). This matches one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
