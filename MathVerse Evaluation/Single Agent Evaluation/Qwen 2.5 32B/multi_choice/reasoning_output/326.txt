====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Examine the geometric figure
The image shows a triangle with:
- A base length of **10.2 ft**.
- A perpendicular height (altitude) of **7 ft**.

### Step 2: Understand the measurements and relationships
The given measurements are:
- Base of the triangle = 10.2 ft.
- Height of the triangle = 7 ft.
The height is perpendicular to the base, as indicated by the right angle symbol.

### Step 3: Identify what needs to be found
We need to find the **area** of the triangle.

### Step 4: Apply the relevant formula
The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

### Step 5: Perform the calculations
Substitute the given values into the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10.2 \times 7
\]

First, calculate the product of the base and height:
\[
10.2 \times 7 = 71.4
\]

Next, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 71.4 = 35.7
\]

### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated area is **35.7 square feet**. This matches option A.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
