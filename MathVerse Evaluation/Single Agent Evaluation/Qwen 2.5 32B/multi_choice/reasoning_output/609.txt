QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What does the average rate of change tell you?

CHOICES:
A:An increase in demand of 500 units will decrease the price of each toy by $\$ 1$
B:An increase in demand of 500 units will increase the price of each toy by $\$ 1$
C:The price of each toy increases by $\$ 0.50$ for each additional 1000 units demanded
D:The price of each toy decreases by $\$ 0.50$ for each additional 1000 units demanded

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Graph**
The graph shows a linear relationship between the quantity (in thousand units) and the price (in dollars). The x-axis represents the quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents the price.

- **Key Points from the Graph**:
  - When the quantity is 5 thousand units, the price is approximately $14.
  - When the quantity is 15 thousand units, the price is approximately $22.
  - When the quantity is 20 thousand units, the price is approximately $25.

#### **Step 2: Understand the Question**
We need to determine the **average rate of change** of the price with respect to the quantity. The average rate of change is calculated as the slope of the line, which represents how much the price changes per unit change in quantity.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Average Rate of Change**
The formula for the average rate of change (slope) is:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{\text{change in price}}{\text{change in quantity}}
\]

##### **Choose Two Points on the Line**:
Let's use the points (5, 14) and (15, 22) for calculation:
- \( (x_1, y_1) = (5, 14) \)
- \( (x_2, y_2) = (15, 22) \)

##### **Calculate the Change in Price (\(\Delta y\))**:
\[
\Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 22 - 14 = 8
\]

##### **Calculate the Change in Quantity (\(\Delta x\))**:
\[
\Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 15 - 5 = 10
\]

##### **Calculate the Slope**:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
\]

This means the price increases by $0.80 for every additional thousand units demanded.

#### **Step 4: Interpret the Result**
The slope of 0.8 indicates that for every increase of 1 thousand units in demand, the price increases by $0.80. To interpret this in terms of 500 units (which is half of 1 thousand units):
- An increase in demand of 500 units will increase the price by \(0.8 \times 0.5 = 0.4\) dollars, or $0.40.
- However, the question asks about the relationship in terms of 1000 units, so we focus on the direct interpretation of the slope.

#### **Step 5: Match the Answer Choices**
- **Choice A**: An increase in demand of 500 units will decrease the price of each toy by $1. (Incorrect, as the slope is positive.)
- **Choice B**: An increase in demand of 500 units will increase the price of each toy by $1. (Incorrect, as the increase is $0.40, not $1.)
- **Choice C**: The price of each toy increases by $0.50 for each additional 1000 units demanded. (Close, but the correct value is $0.80, not $0.50.)
- **Choice D**: The price of each toy decreases by $0.50 for each additional 1000 units demanded. (Incorrect, as the slope is positive, indicating an increase, not a decrease.)

#### **Step 6: Final Decision**
The correct interpretation is that the price increases by $0.80 for each additional 1000 units demanded. Since none of the options exactly match this, we select the closest option, which is **Choice C**.

### Final Answer: C
