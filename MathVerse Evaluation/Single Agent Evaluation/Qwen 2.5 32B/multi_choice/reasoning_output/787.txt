### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- The smaller circles each have a radius of 3.
- The smaller circles are tangent to each other at point \( B \).
- The smaller circles are also tangent to the larger circle at points \( A \) and \( C \).
- Point \( B \) is the center of the larger circle.

#### **Step 2: Determine the radius of the larger circle**
- Since the smaller circles are tangent to each other at \( B \), the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. Therefore, the distance between the centers of the two smaller circles is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \).
- Since \( B \) is the center of the larger circle and the smaller circles are tangent to the larger circle at points \( A \) and \( C \), the radius of the larger circle is the sum of the radius of one smaller circle and the distance from the center of the smaller circle to \( B \). This means the radius of the larger circle is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \).

#### **Step 3: Analyze the shaded region**
- The shaded region consists of two segments: one arc from the larger circle and one arc from each of the smaller circles.
- The arc from the larger circle is a semicircle because the smaller circles are symmetrically placed and tangent to the larger circle at points \( A \) and \( C \). The radius of the larger circle is 6, so the length of the semicircular arc is:
  \[
  \text{Length of semicircular arc} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times 6 = 6\pi
  \]
- Each of the smaller circles contributes a quarter-circle arc (since the smaller circles are tangent to each other and the larger circle, forming a right angle at \( B \)). The radius of each smaller circle is 3, so the length of each quarter-circle arc is:
  \[
  \text{Length of quarter-circle arc} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2\pi \times 3 = \frac{3\pi}{2}
  \]
- There are two such quarter-circle arcs, so the total length of the arcs from the smaller circles is:
  \[
  2 \times \frac{3\pi}{2} = 3\pi
  \]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the total perimeter of the shaded region**
- The total perimeter of the shaded region is the sum of the semicircular arc from the larger circle and the two quarter-circle arcs from the smaller circles:
  \[
  \text{Total perimeter} = 6\pi + 3\pi = 9\pi
  \]

#### **Step 5: Match the result with the answer choices**
- The calculated perimeter of the shaded region is \( 9\pi \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
