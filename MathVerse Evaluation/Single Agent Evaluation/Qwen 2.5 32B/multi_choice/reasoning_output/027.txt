QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, when planting trees on flat ground, the plant spacing (the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees) is required to be 4.0. If trees are planted on a hillside with a slope of 0.75, and the plant spacing is also required to be 4.0, then the slope distance between two adjacent trees is ()

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves calculating the slope distance between two adjacent trees planted on a hillside. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Given Information**:
   - Plant spacing (horizontal distance between two adjacent trees) = 4.0 meters.
   - Slope of the hill = 0.75.
   - We need to find the slope distance (hypotenuse) between two adjacent trees.

2. **Understanding the Slope**:
   - The slope of a hill is defined as the ratio of the vertical rise to the horizontal run. Mathematically, slope = rise/run.
   - Here, the slope is 0.75, which means for every 1 unit of horizontal distance, the vertical rise is 0.75 units.

3. **Geometric Representation**:
   - Let the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees be \( d_h = 4.0 \) meters.
   - The vertical rise corresponding to this horizontal distance can be calculated using the slope:
     \[
     \text{Vertical rise} = \text{slope} \times \text{horizontal distance} = 0.75 \times 4.0 = 3.0 \text{ meters}.
     \]

4. **Calculating the Slope Distance**:
   - The slope distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where:
     - One leg is the horizontal distance (\( d_h = 4.0 \) meters).
     - The other leg is the vertical rise (\( d_v = 3.0 \) meters).
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     \text{Slope distance} = \sqrt{d_h^2 + d_v^2} = \sqrt{4.0^2 + 3.0^2} = \sqrt{16.0 + 9.0} = \sqrt{25.0} = 5.0 \text{ meters}.
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The slope distance between two adjacent trees is 5.0 meters.
