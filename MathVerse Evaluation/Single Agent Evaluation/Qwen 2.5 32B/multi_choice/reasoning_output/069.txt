====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Line \(a\) is parallel to line \(b\).
- \(\angle 2 = 35^\circ\).
- \(\angle 3 = 40^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 1\).

### Step 2: Understand the relationships
Since line \(a\) is parallel to line \(b\), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals:
- Corresponding angles are equal.
- Alternate interior angles are equal.
- Co-interior (consecutive interior) angles are supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).

### Step 3: Determine the relationship between \(\angle 2\) and other angles
The angle \(\angle 2\) is given as \(35^\circ\). Since line \(a\) is parallel to line \(b\), the angle corresponding to \(\angle 2\) on line \(b\) will also be \(35^\circ\). Let's call this corresponding angle \(\angle 4\). Therefore:
\[ \angle 4 = 35^\circ. \]

### Step 4: Use the sum of angles in a triangle
In the triangle formed by the lines and the transversal, the sum of the interior angles is \(180^\circ\). The triangle includes \(\angle 3\), \(\angle 4\), and another angle, which we can call \(\angle 5\). The angle \(\angle 5\) is adjacent to \(\angle 1\) and forms a linear pair with it. Therefore:
\[ \angle 5 = 180^\circ - (\angle 3 + \angle 4). \]
Substituting the values:
\[ \angle 5 = 180^\circ - (40^\circ + 35^\circ) = 180^\circ - 75^\circ = 105^\circ. \]

### Step 5: Determine \(\angle 1\)
Since \(\angle 5\) and \(\angle 1\) form a linear pair (they are supplementary):
\[ \angle 1 + \angle 5 = 180^\circ. \]
Substituting the value of \(\angle 5\):
\[ \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 105^\circ = 75^\circ. \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(75^\circ\).
