### Analysis of the Problem:
We are tasked with determining which coordinate corresponds to \( \sin(310^\circ) \). To solve this, we need to understand the relationship between the sine function and the coordinates of points on the unit circle.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Unit Circle
The unit circle is a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1. Any point \( (x, y) \) on the unit circle can be expressed in terms of an angle \( \theta \) as:
\[
(x, y) = (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
\]
Here, \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \).

#### Step 2: Identifying the Angle \( 310^\circ \)
The angle \( 310^\circ \) is measured counterclockwise from the positive \( x \)-axis. However, since \( 310^\circ \) is more than \( 360^\circ/2 = 180^\circ \), it lies in the fourth quadrant. Specifically:
\[
310^\circ = 360^\circ - 50^\circ
\]
This means \( 310^\circ \) is equivalent to moving \( 50^\circ \) clockwise from the positive \( x \)-axis.

#### Step 3: Coordinates of the Point Corresponding to \( 310^\circ \)
In the fourth quadrant:
- The cosine (x-coordinate) is positive.
- The sine (y-coordinate) is negative.

For \( \theta = 310^\circ \):
\[
x = \cos(310^\circ) = \cos(360^\circ - 50^\circ) = \cos(50^\circ)
\]
\[
y = \sin(310^\circ) = \sin(360^\circ - 50^\circ) = -\sin(50^\circ)
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the point on the unit circle corresponding to \( 310^\circ \) are:
\[
(\cos(310^\circ), \sin(310^\circ)) = (\cos(50^\circ), -\sin(50^\circ))
\]

#### Step 4: Matching Coordinates to the Points in the Image
From the image:
- Point \( A \) is in the first quadrant.
- Point \( B \) is in the third quadrant.
- Point \( C \) is in the fourth quadrant.

Point \( C \) is the point corresponding to \( 310^\circ \) because it is in the fourth quadrant. The coordinates of point \( C \) are:
\[
(x_C, y_C) = (\cos(310^\circ), \sin(310^\circ)) = (\cos(50^\circ), -\sin(50^\circ))
\]

#### Step 5: Identifying \( \sin(310^\circ) \)
From the coordinates of point \( C \):
\[
\sin(310^\circ) = y_C
\]
Thus, \( \sin(310^\circ) \) is the **y-coordinate of point \( C \)**.

#### Final Answer:
The coordinate that equals \( \sin(310^\circ) \) is the **y-coordinate of point \( C \)**.
