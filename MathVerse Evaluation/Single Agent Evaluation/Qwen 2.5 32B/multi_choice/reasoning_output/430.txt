QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows the following:
- **School**: Located at the bottom-right corner.
- **Bus Stop**: Located at the top-left corner.
- **Playground**: Positioned between the School and Bus Stop.
- **Paths**:
  - A straight path (orange) directly connecting the School to the Bus Stop.
  - Another path (yellow) that goes through the Playground, which appears longer than the direct path.

#### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
- The direct path from the School to the Bus Stop is represented by a straight line, which is the shortest distance between two points.
- The path through the Playground is a detour, as it involves an additional route that bypasses the direct line.

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine whether the quickest way for Sally to walk from the School to the Bus Stop is through the playground. This requires comparing the lengths of the two paths:
1. The direct path from the School to the Bus Stop.
2. The path that goes through the Playground.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Principles
- **Shortest Distance Principle**: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.
- From the image, it is clear that the direct path (orange line) is shorter than the path through the Playground (yellow line).

#### Step 5: Show Calculations (if necessary)
While the image does not provide numerical distances, the geometric principle is sufficient to conclude that the direct path is shorter. There is no need for explicit calculation here, as the visual representation confirms the relative lengths.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The question asks whether the quickest way to the bus stop is through the playground. Based on the geometric principle and the image:
- The direct path is shorter.
- Therefore, the statement "The quickest way to get there will be through the playground" is false.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
