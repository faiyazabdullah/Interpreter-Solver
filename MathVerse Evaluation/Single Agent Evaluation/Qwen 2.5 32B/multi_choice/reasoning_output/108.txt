QUESTION:
Shaoxing is a famous bridge township. As shown in the figure, the distance CD from the top of the round arch bridge to the water surface is 8.0, and the arch radius OC is 5.0, so the width of the water surface AB is ()

CHOICES:
A:4m
B:5m
C:6m
D:8m

To solve the problem, let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The distance from the top of the round arch bridge (point $ C $) to the water surface (line $ AB $) is $ CD = 8 $.
- The radius of the circle forming the arch is $ OC = 5 $.
- We need to find the width of the water surface $ AB $.

### Step 2: Identify the geometric relationships
- $ O $ is the center of the circle.
- $ CD $ is perpendicular to $ AB $, and $ D $ is the midpoint of $ AB $ because $ CD $ is a radius dropped perpendicularly to the chord $ AB $. This means $ AD = DB $, and $ AB = 2 \cdot AD $.
- The length $ OD $ can be calculated as the difference between the radius $ OC $ and the height $ CD $ above the water surface:
  $$
  OD = OC - CD = 5 - 8 = -3.
  $$
  However, since $ D $ is below the center $ O $, we should interpret this as the vertical distance from $ O $ to $ D $ being $ 3 $ units downward. Thus, $ OD = 3 $.

### Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem
- In the right triangle $ OAD $, we have:
  - $ OA = OC = 5 $ (the radius of the circle),
  - $ OD = 3 $,
  - $ AD $ is the unknown we need to find.
- By the Pythagorean theorem:
  $$
  OA^2 = OD^2 + AD^2.
  $$
  Substituting the known values:
  $$
  5^2 = 3^2 + AD^2.
  $$
  Simplify:
  $$
  25 = 9 + AD^2.
  $$
  Solve for $ AD^2 $:
  $$
  AD^2 = 25 - 9 = 16.
  $$
  Take the square root of both sides:
  $$
  AD = \sqrt{16} = 4.
  $$

### Step 4: Find the width of the water surface $ AB $
- Since $ D $ is the midpoint of $ AB $, we have:
  $$
  AB = 2 \cdot AD = 2 \cdot 4 = 8.
  $$

### Final Answer:
The width of the water surface $ AB $ is $ 8 $.

Final Answer: D
