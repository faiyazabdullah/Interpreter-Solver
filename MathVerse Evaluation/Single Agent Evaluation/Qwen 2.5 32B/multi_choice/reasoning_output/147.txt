QUESTION:
In order to measure the height of the school flagpole AC, a school math interest group erected a benchmark DF with a length of 1.5 at point F. As shown in the figure, the length of the shadow EF of DF is measured as 1.0, and then measure the length of the shadow BC of the flagpole AC to be 6.0, then the height of the flagpole AC is ()

CHOICES:
A:6米
B:7米
C:8.5米
D:9米

====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometric relationships between the given objects and their shadows. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The benchmark $DF$ has a length of $1.5$ meters.
- The shadow of $DF$, denoted as $EF$, has a length of $1.0$ meter.
- The shadow of the flagpole $AC$, denoted as $BC$, has a length of $6.0$ meters.
- We need to find the height of the flagpole $AC$.

### Step 2: Recognize the similar triangles
The key observation here is that the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar. Specifically:
- Triangle $DEF$ (formed by the benchmark $DF$ and its shadow $EF$) is similar to triangle $ABC$ (formed by the flagpole $AC$ and its shadow $BC$).

This similarity arises because the sun's rays are parallel, and the angles of incidence are the same for both the benchmark and the flagpole. Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides of these triangles are equal.

### Step 3: Set up the proportion
From the similarity of triangles $DEF$ and $ABC$, we have:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of the benchmark}}{\text{Length of the shadow of the benchmark}} = \frac{\text{Height of the flagpole}}{\text{Length of the shadow of the flagpole}}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\frac{DF}{EF} = \frac{AC}{BC}
\]
\[
\frac{1.5}{1.0} = \frac{AC}{6.0}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for $AC$
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{1.5}{1.0} = 1.5
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
1.5 = \frac{AC}{6.0}
\]
To find $AC$, multiply both sides by $6.0$:
\[
AC = 1.5 \times 6.0 = 9.0
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The height of the flagpole $AC$ is $9.0$ meters. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 6米
- B: 7米
- C: 8.5米
- D: 9米

The correct answer is $D$.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
