### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given a geometric figure where two parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \) are intersected by a transversal line passing through point \( B \). The angles formed at the intersections are labeled as follows:
- At point \( A \), the angle between the transversal and line \( l \) is \( 38^\circ \).
- At point \( C \), the angle between the transversal and line \( m \) is \( 33^\circ \).

We need to find the measure of \( \angle ABC \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- Line \( l \) is parallel to line \( m \).
- The angle at point \( A \) (between the transversal and line \( l \)) is \( 38^\circ \).
- The angle at point \( C \) (between the transversal and line \( m \)) is \( 33^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Use properties of parallel lines and transversals
When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the following properties hold:
1. **Corresponding Angles**: Angles in corresponding positions are equal.
2. **Alternate Interior Angles**: Angles on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines are equal.
3. **Consecutive Interior Angles**: Angles on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 3: Determine the relationship between the angles
Since \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel, the angles formed by the transversal at points \( A \) and \( C \) can help us find \( \angle ABC \).

- The angle at point \( A \) is \( 38^\circ \). This angle is an alternate interior angle to the angle directly below it on line \( l \). Therefore, the angle directly below \( A \) on line \( l \) is also \( 38^\circ \).
- Similarly, the angle at point \( C \) is \( 33^\circ \). This angle is an alternate interior angle to the angle directly above it on line \( m \). Therefore, the angle directly above \( C \) on line \( m \) is also \( 33^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Calculate \( \angle ABC \)
The angle \( \angle ABC \) is the sum of the two angles formed by the transversal and the parallel lines at points \( A \) and \( C \):
\[
\angle ABC = 38^\circ + 33^\circ = 71^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle ABC \) is \( 71^\circ \).
