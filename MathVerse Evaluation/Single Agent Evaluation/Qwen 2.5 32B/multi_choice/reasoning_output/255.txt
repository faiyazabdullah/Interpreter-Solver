### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector of \( \overline{XZ} \).
- \( WZ = 14.9 \).
- We need to find the length of \( WX \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Perpendicular Bisector
A **perpendicular bisector** of a segment divides it into two equal parts and is perpendicular to the segment at its midpoint. This means:
- \( m \) intersects \( \overline{XZ} \) at its midpoint.
- \( XY = YZ \).

#### Step 2: Key Geometric Properties
Since \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector:
- \( WY = WZ \) (by the property of perpendicular bisectors, points equidistant from the endpoints of the segment lie on the bisector).
- Therefore, \( WY = 14.9 \).

#### Step 3: Symmetry and Equal Segments
Because \( m \) is the perpendicular bisector, the segments on either side of \( m \) are symmetric. Specifically:
- \( WX = WZ \).

#### Step 4: Calculating \( WX \)
From the symmetry and the properties of the perpendicular bisector:
- \( WX = WZ \).
- Given \( WZ = 14.9 \), it follows that \( WX = 14.9 \).

#### Step 5: Comparing with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( WX \) is \( 14.9 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 7.45
- B: 14.9
- C: 22.4
- D: 25.3

The correct answer is \( 14.9 \), which corresponds to choice B.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
