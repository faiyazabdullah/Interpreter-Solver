QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric figure and apply relevant theorems and properties step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- \( \odot M \) is a circle with center \( M \).
- \( MK \) and \( MP \) are radii of the circle.
- \( MK \perp FG \) and \( MP \perp HJ \), meaning the radii are perpendicular to the chords they intersect.
- \( FL = 24 \), which means the length of half of chord \( FG \) is 24. Therefore, the full length of \( FG \) is \( 2 \times 24 = 48 \).
- \( HJ = 48 \), which is the full length of chord \( HJ \).
- \( \angle HMP = 65^\circ \).

### Step 2: Use the property of perpendicular radii
When a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord. This means:
- \( FL = LG = 24 \), so \( FG = 2 \times 24 = 48 \).
- \( HN = NJ = 24 \), so \( HJ = 2 \times 24 = 48 \).

### Step 3: Verify the length of \( FG \)
From the given information, we already know that \( FL = 24 \). Since \( MK \perp FG \), \( MK \) bisects \( FG \). Therefore, the full length of \( FG \) is:
\[ FG = 2 \times FL = 2 \times 24 = 48. \]

### Step 4: Compare with the answer choices
The length of \( FG \) is 48. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 24
- B: 32
- C: 48
- D: 65

The correct answer is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
