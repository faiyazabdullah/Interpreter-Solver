QUESTION:
There is a function representing a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1 unit. There is a point A on the circle with an angle of $\frac{\pi}{5}$ to the negative x-axis. What is the value of the x-coordinate of point A?

CHOICES:
A:$\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)$
B:$\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)$
C:$\sin \left(\frac{6 \pi}{5}\right)$
D:$\cos \left(\frac{6 \pi}{5}\right)$
E:$\sin \left(\frac{9 \pi}{5}\right)$
F:$\cos \left(\frac{9 \pi}{5}\right)$

To solve the problem, let's follow the steps systematically:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The circle is centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a radius of 1.
- Point \( A \) lies on the circle.
- The angle between the negative \( x \)-axis and the line segment from the origin to point \( A \) is \(\frac{\pi}{5}\).

### Step 2: Use the relationship between coordinates and angles on a circle
For a point on a circle centered at the origin with radius 1, the coordinates \((x, y)\) can be expressed in terms of the angle \(\theta\) (measured counterclockwise from the positive \( x \)-axis) as:
\[
x = \cos(\theta), \quad y = \sin(\theta)
\]

### Step 3: Determine the angle \(\theta\)
The angle \(\frac{\pi}{5}\) is measured from the **negative \( x \)-axis**. To convert this to an angle measured from the **positive \( x \)-axis**, we need to add \(\pi\) (since moving from the negative \( x \)-axis to the positive \( x \)-axis involves an additional \(\pi\) radians):
\[
\theta = \pi + \frac{\pi}{5} = \frac{5\pi}{5} + \frac{\pi}{5} = \frac{6\pi}{5}
\]

### Step 4: Find the \( x \)-coordinate of point \( A \)
Using the formula for the \( x \)-coordinate of a point on the unit circle:
\[
x = \cos(\theta)
\]
Substitute \(\theta = \frac{6\pi}{5}\):
\[
x = \cos\left(\frac{6\pi}{5}\right)
\]

### Step 5: Match the result with the answer choices
The \( x \)-coordinate of point \( A \) is \(\cos\left(\frac{6\pi}{5}\right)\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\)
- B: \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\)
- C: \(\sin\left(\frac{6\pi}{5}\right)\)
- D: \(\cos\left(\frac{6\pi}{5}\right)\)
- E: \(\sin\left(\frac{9\pi}{5}\right)\)
- F: \(\cos\left(\frac{9\pi}{5}\right)\)

The correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]

### Final Answer: D
