QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the homothetic figures are composed of a triangle ruler and its center projection under the light. If the ratio of the distance from the bulb to the vertex of the triangle ruler to the distance from the bulb to the corresponding vertex of the triangular ruler projection is 2.0:5.0, and the length of one edge of the triangle ruler is 8.0, Then the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is ()

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves understanding the concept of **homothety** (or similarity transformations) where one figure is a scaled version of another. Here, the triangle ruler and its projection form a pair of similar figures. The key information provided includes:

1. The **ratio of distances**: The distance from the bulb to the vertex of the triangle ruler to the distance from the bulb to the corresponding vertex of the projection is \(2:5\).
2. The **length of one edge of the triangle ruler**: 8.0 cm.
3. We need to find the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. Understanding Homothety:
In homothety, the ratio of corresponding lengths of two similar figures is equal to the ratio of their distances from the center of homothety (in this case, the bulb). This ratio is called the **scale factor**.

Given:
- Distance ratio = \( \frac{\text{Distance from bulb to triangle ruler}}{\text{Distance from bulb to projection}} = \frac{2}{5} \).

The scale factor \( k \) for the lengths of the figures is the same as the distance ratio. Therefore, the scale factor \( k = \frac{2}{5} \).

#### 2. Applying the Scale Factor:
The length of one edge of the triangle ruler is 8.0 cm. Let the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle be \( x \). Since the projection is a scaled version of the triangle ruler, we have:
\[
x = 8.0 \times \text{scale factor}
\]
Substituting the scale factor \( k = \frac{2}{5} \):
\[
x = 8.0 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

#### 3. Calculating the Corresponding Edge Length:
\[
x = 8.0 \times \frac{5}{2} = 8.0 \times 2.5 = 20.0 \text{ cm}
\]

#### 4. Verifying the Answer:
The corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is 20.0 cm, which matches one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
