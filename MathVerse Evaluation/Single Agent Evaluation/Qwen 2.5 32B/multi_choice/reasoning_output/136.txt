QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to measure the degree of tree AB, a certain mathematics learning interest group measured the length of the tree's shadow BC in the sun as 9.0. At the same moment, they also measured the shadow length of Xiaoliang in the sun as 1.5. Knowing that Xiaoliang's height is 1.8, then the height of tree AB is ()

CHOICES:
A:10.8m
B:9m
C:7.5m
D:0.3m

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the height of a tree (denoted as \( AB \)) using the information provided about shadows and the height of a person. The key geometric principle here is the **similar triangles** formed by the tree and its shadow, as well as the person and their shadow. Since the sun's rays are parallel, the triangles formed by the tree and its shadow, and the person and their shadow, are similar.

#### Given Information:
1. Length of the tree's shadow (\( BC \)): 9.0 meters.
2. Length of Xiaoliang's shadow: 1.5 meters.
3. Height of Xiaoliang: 1.8 meters.
4. We need to find the height of the tree (\( AB \)).

#### Geometric Relationships:
- The triangle formed by the tree and its shadow (\( \triangle ABC \)) is similar to the triangle formed by Xiaoliang and his shadow (\( \triangle DEF \)), where:
  - \( AB \) is the height of the tree.
  - \( BC \) is the length of the tree's shadow.
  - \( DE \) is Xiaoliang's height (1.8 meters).
  - \( EF \) is the length of Xiaoliang's shadow (1.5 meters).

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of the tree}}{\text{Length of the tree's shadow}} = \frac{\text{Height of Xiaoliang}}{\text{Length of Xiaoliang's shadow}}
\]
This can be written as:
\[
\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{DE}{EF}
\]

#### Substituting the Known Values:
- \( AB = x \) (height of the tree, which we need to find).
- \( BC = 9.0 \) meters.
- \( DE = 1.8 \) meters.
- \( EF = 1.5 \) meters.

The similarity ratio becomes:
\[
\frac{x}{9.0} = \frac{1.8}{1.5}
\]

#### Solving for \( x \):
First, simplify the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
\frac{1.8}{1.5} = \frac{18}{15} = \frac{6}{5}
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x}{9.0} = \frac{6}{5}
\]

To solve for \( x \), cross-multiply:
\[
x \cdot 5 = 9.0 \cdot 6
\]
\[
5x = 54
\]
\[
x = \frac{54}{5}
\]
\[
x = 10.8
\]

#### Conclusion:
The height of the tree \( AB \) is 10.8 meters. Comparing this with the given answer choices, we find that the correct answer is:
