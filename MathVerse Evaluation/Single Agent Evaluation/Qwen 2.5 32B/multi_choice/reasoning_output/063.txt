### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **1. Analyze the Given Information:**
- The figure shows a triangle with points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), and \( E \).
- \( EB \) and \( DC \) are perpendicular to \( AC \).
- \( AB = 3.0 \), \( AC = 9.0 \), and \( BE = 2.0 \).
- Points \( A \), \( E \), and \( D \) are collinear.
- We need to find the height of the tree \( CD \).

#### **2. Understand the Geometric Relationships:**
- Since \( EB \) and \( DC \) are both perpendicular to \( AC \), triangles \( ABE \) and \( ACD \) are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity:
  - \( \angle AEB = \angle ADC = 90^\circ \) (both are right angles).
  - \( \angle BAE = \angle CAD \) (since \( A \), \( E \), and \( D \) are collinear).
- Therefore, \( \triangle ABE \sim \triangle ACD \).

#### **3. Use Similar Triangles:**
From the similarity of triangles \( ABE \) and \( ACD \):
\[
\frac{BE}{DC} = \frac{AB}{AC}
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
\frac{2.0}{DC} = \frac{3.0}{9.0}
\]

#### **4. Solve for \( DC \):**
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{3.0}{9.0} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2.0}{DC} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Cross-multiply to solve for \( DC \):
\[
2.0 \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot DC \implies DC = 6.0
\]

#### **5. Verify the Calculation:**
The proportionality holds because the triangles are similar, and the sides are in the same ratio. The calculation is consistent with the given data.

#### **6. Match the Answer with the Choices:**
The calculated height of the tree \( CD \) is \( 6.0 \) meters. Comparing this with the given choices:
- A: 6米
- B: 7.5米
- C: 8米
- D: 8.5米

The correct answer is \( 6 \) meters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
