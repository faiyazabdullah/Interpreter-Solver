### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- The lines \( l \parallel m \parallel n \).
- Points \( B \) and \( C \) lie on lines \( n \) and \( m \), respectively.
- The angle between \( BC \) and the line \( n \) is \( 25^\circ \). This means \( \angle BCD = 25^\circ \), where \( D \) is a point on line \( n \) such that \( CD \) is perpendicular to \( n \).
- \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \).

#### **Step 2: Analyze the geometry**
Since \( l \parallel m \parallel n \), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals. Specifically, the angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are related through corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and supplementary angles.

#### **Step 3: Determine key angles**
1. **Identify \( \angle BCD \):**
   - The angle between \( BC \) and the line \( n \) is given as \( 25^\circ \). This means \( \angle BCD = 25^\circ \).

2. **Use the fact that \( m \parallel n \):**
   - Since \( m \parallel n \), the angle between \( BC \) and the line \( m \) is also \( 25^\circ \). Let \( E \) be a point on line \( m \) such that \( CE \) is perpendicular to \( m \). Then \( \angle BCE = 25^\circ \).

3. **Analyze \( \triangle ABC \):**
   - In \( \triangle ABC \), we know \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \).
   - We need to find \( \angle a \), which is the angle between the line \( AB \) and the line \( l \).

#### **Step 4: Use the properties of parallel lines**
- Since \( l \parallel m \parallel n \), the angle \( \angle a \) is equal to the angle formed by the transversal \( AB \) with line \( n \) minus the angle between \( BC \) and line \( n \).

#### **Step 5: Calculate \( \angle a \)**
1. **Angle between \( AB \) and \( n \):**
   - The angle between \( AB \) and \( n \) is the same as the angle between \( AB \) and \( m \) because \( m \parallel n \).
   - In \( \triangle ABC \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     \angle BAC + \angle ACB + \angle ABC = 180^\circ
     \]
     Given \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \), we need to find \( \angle ABC \).

2. **Find \( \angle ABC \):**
   - Since \( \angle BCE = 25^\circ \), the angle \( \angle ABC \) is the supplement of \( \angle BCE \) because \( BC \) is a straight line segment extending from \( B \) to \( C \):
     \[
     \angle ABC = 180^\circ - \angle BCE - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 25^\circ - 60^\circ = 95^\circ
     \]

3. **Determine \( \angle a \):**
   - The angle \( \angle a \) is the difference between \( \angle ABC \) and the angle between \( BC \) and \( n \):
     \[
     \angle a = \angle ABC - \angle BCD = 95^\circ - 60^\circ = 35^\circ
     \]

#### **Step 6: Verify the answer**
- The angle \( \angle a \) is correctly calculated as \( 35^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
