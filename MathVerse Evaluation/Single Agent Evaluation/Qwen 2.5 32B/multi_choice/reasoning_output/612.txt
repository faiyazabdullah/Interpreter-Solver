QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a quadratic function that opens upwards and passes through the origin. The function is symmetric about the y-axis, which is characteristic of quadratic functions of the form \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
- The function passes through the origin, meaning when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \). This implies that the constant term \( c = 0 \).
- The function is symmetric about the y-axis, indicating that it does not have any odd-powered terms (e.g., \( x \)) because odd-powered terms would break the symmetry.
- The general form of the function simplifies to \( y = ax^2 \) since there is no linear term \( bx \) (odd power) and no constant term \( c \).

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine whether the graphed function has an **even** or **odd** power. In mathematical terms:
- An **even power** means the function involves terms like \( x^2, x^4, x^6, \ldots \).
- An **odd power** means the function involves terms like \( x, x^3, x^5, \ldots \).

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Properties
- Quadratic functions are polynomials of degree 2, and their general form is \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \).
- Since the function passes through the origin and is symmetric about the y-axis, the function must be of the form \( y = ax^2 \), where \( a \) is a positive constant (because the parabola opens upwards).
- The term \( ax^2 \) is an even power of \( x \).

#### Step 5: Show Calculations Clearly
The function is \( y = ax^2 \):
- The highest power of \( x \) in the function is 2, which is an even number.
- There are no odd-powered terms present in the function.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
- The function \( y = ax^2 \) contains only even powers of \( x \).
- Therefore, the graphed function has an **even power**.

#### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
