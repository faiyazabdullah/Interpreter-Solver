To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric configuration step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Circle \( O \) has a diameter \( AB \).
- \( AO = OB = PB = 1 \). Therefore, the radius \( OA = OB = 1 \), and the diameter \( AB = 2 \).
- Point \( P \) lies on the extension of \( AB \) such that \( PB = 1 \).
- \( PC \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( C \).

### Step 2: Use the properties of tangents and right triangles
By the **tangent-secant theorem**, if a tangent is drawn from an external point to a circle, the distance from the external point to the point of tangency forms a right triangle with the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. Specifically:
- \( OC \) is the radius of the circle, so \( OC = 1 \).
- \( PC \) is the tangent, and \( OC \perp PC \) (the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency).

Thus, \( \triangle OCP \) is a right triangle with:
- \( OC = 1 \) (radius),
- \( OP \) as the hypotenuse,
- \( PC \) as one of the legs.

### Step 3: Calculate the length of \( OP \)
Since \( P \) is on the extension of \( AB \) and \( PB = 1 \), we can determine the total length \( OP \):
- \( OB = 1 \) (radius),
- \( BP = 1 \),
- Therefore, \( OP = OB + BP = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

### Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle OCP \)
In the right triangle \( OCP \):
- \( OP \) is the hypotenuse,
- \( OC \) is one leg (radius),
- \( PC \) is the other leg (tangent).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
OP^2 = OC^2 + PC^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
2^2 = 1^2 + PC^2
\]
\[
4 = 1 + PC^2
\]
\[
PC^2 = 4 - 1
\]
\[
PC^2 = 3
\]
\[
PC = \sqrt{3}
\]

### Step 5: Match the result with the answer choices
The length of \( PC \) is \( \sqrt{3} \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 1
- B: \( \sqrt{3} \)
- C: 2
- D: \( \sqrt{5} \)

The correct answer is \( \sqrt{3} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
