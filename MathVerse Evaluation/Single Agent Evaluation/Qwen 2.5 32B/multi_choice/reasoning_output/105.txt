### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- $ AB $ is the diameter of circle $ O $.
- $ CD $ is a chord of circle $ O $.
- The extended lines of $ AB $ and $ CD $ intersect at point $ E $.
- $ AB = 2 \cdot DE $.
- $ \angle E = 16^\circ $.

We need to find the measure of $ \angle ABC $.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- Since $ AB $ is the diameter, $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $ (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle).
- $ \angle E = 16^\circ $ is given as the angle formed by the intersection of the extended lines of $ AB $ and $ CD $ at point $ E $.

#### **Step 2: Use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals**
Since $ AB $ is the diameter, $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $. This implies that $ \triangle ACB $ is a right triangle with $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $.

#### **Step 3: Analyze the relationship between $ AB $ and $ DE $**
Given that $ AB = 2 \cdot DE $, we can infer that $ DE $ is half the length of the diameter. However, this relationship will be more useful later when we consider the angles.

#### **Step 4: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem**
The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. We will use this theorem to relate the angles in the circle.

#### **Step 5: Use the External Angle Theorem**
The external angle $ \angle E $ is equal to the difference between the two non-adjacent internal angles of the triangle formed by the intersecting lines. Specifically, in $ \triangle CDE $, $ \angle E = \angle CDE - \angle DCE $.

However, since $ AB $ is the diameter, we can focus on the fact that $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $. This simplifies our analysis because $ \angle ABC $ is part of the right triangle $ \triangle ACB $.

#### **Step 6: Relate $ \angle E $ to $ \angle ABC $**
Since $ \angle E = 16^\circ $, and $ \angle ACB = 90^\circ $, we can use the fact that $ \angle ABC $ is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc $ AC $. The key insight is that $ \angle ABC $ is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

However, a more direct approach is to use the fact that $ \angle ABC $ is part of the right triangle $ \triangle ACB $, and the external angle $ \angle E $ is related to the angles in the triangle. Specifically, $ \angle ABC = 2 \cdot \angle E $ because $ \angle E $ is the angle formed by the tangent and the chord, and the inscribed angle is twice the angle formed by the tangent and the chord.

Thus, $ \angle ABC = 2 \cdot 16^\circ = 32^\circ $.

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{A}
