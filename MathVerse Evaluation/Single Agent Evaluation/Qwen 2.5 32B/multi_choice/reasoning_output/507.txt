QUESTION:
Which of the following could be the equation of the graphed line, whose y-intercept is 3 and x-intercept is -8?

CHOICES:
A.$3 x-8 y=24$
B.$3 x-8 y=-24$
C.$3 x+8 y=24$
D.$3 x+8 y=-24$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the equation of the line given its y-intercept and x-intercept. Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The **y-intercept** is 3. This means the line passes through the point \((0, 3)\).
- The **x-intercept** is -8. This means the line passes through the point \((-8, 0)\).

### Step 2: Use the intercept form of the line equation
The intercept form of a line's equation is:
\[
\frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1
\]
where \(a\) is the x-intercept and \(b\) is the y-intercept.

Here:
- \(a = -8\)
- \(b = 3\)

Substitute these values into the intercept form:
\[
\frac{x}{-8} + \frac{y}{3} = 1
\]

### Step 3: Clear the fractions by multiplying through by the least common denominator (LCD)
The LCD of \(-8\) and \(3\) is \(24\). Multiply every term by \(24\):
\[
24 \left( \frac{x}{-8} \right) + 24 \left( \frac{y}{3} \right) = 24 \cdot 1
\]

Simplify each term:
\[
24 \left( \frac{x}{-8} \right) = \frac{24x}{-8} = -3x
\]
\[
24 \left( \frac{y}{3} \right) = \frac{24y}{3} = 8y
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
-3x + 8y = 24
\]

### Step 4: Rearrange the equation to match the given choices
The equation \(-3x + 8y = 24\) can be rewritten as:
\[
3x - 8y = -24
\]

### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The equation \(3x - 8y = -24\) matches option **B**.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
