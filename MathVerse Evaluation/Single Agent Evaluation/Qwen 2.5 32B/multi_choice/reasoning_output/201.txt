### Problem Analysis:
We are given a circle with center \( M \). Two chords \( AC \) and \( TN \) are present, and the distances from the center \( M \) to these chords are equal. This means that the perpendiculars dropped from \( M \) to the chords \( AC \) and \( TN \) are of equal length. We need to find the measure of \( \angle CAM \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - \( M \) is the center of the circle.
   - \( AC \) and \( TN \) are chords of the circle.
   - The perpendicular distances from \( M \) to the chords \( AC \) and \( TN \) are equal.
   - \( \angle TMN = 28^\circ \).

#### 2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Since the perpendicular distances from \( M \) to the chords \( AC \) and \( TN \) are equal, the chords are equidistant from the center \( M \). This implies that the chords are congruent (equal in length) because in a circle, chords equidistant from the center are congruent.
   - Let the perpendicular from \( M \) to chord \( AC \) intersect \( AC \) at point \( P \), and the perpendicular from \( M \) to chord \( TN \) intersect \( TN \) at point \( Q \). By the given condition, \( MP = MQ \).

#### 3. **Key Geometric Properties:**
   - The perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord bisects the chord. Therefore, \( P \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), and \( Q \) is the midpoint of \( TN \).
   - Since \( MP = MQ \) and both are radii of the circle, the triangles formed by these perpendiculars and the radii to the endpoints of the chords are congruent by the Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) theorem.

#### 4. **Focus on \( \angle CAM \):**
   - Consider the right triangle \( \triangle MAP \). Here, \( MP \) is the perpendicular from the center to the chord \( AC \), and \( AP \) is half the length of chord \( AC \).
   - Since \( MP \) is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord, \( \angle AMP = 90^\circ \).
   - The angle \( \angle CAM \) is part of the right triangle \( \triangle MAP \). To find \( \angle CAM \), we need to use the fact that the central angle subtended by the chord \( TN \) is \( \angle TMN = 28^\circ \).

#### 5. **Relate \( \angle CAM \) to \( \angle TMN \):**
   - The angle \( \angle CAM \) is half of the central angle subtended by the same arc as \( \angle TMN \). This is because the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - Therefore, \( \angle CAM = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle TMN = \frac{1}{2} \times 28^\circ = 14^\circ \).

#### 6. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \( \angle CAM \) is \( 14^\circ \).
