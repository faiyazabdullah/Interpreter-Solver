QUESTION:
Piecewise functions $f$ and $g$ can model the heights (in meters) of two airplanes. $g$ is purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), and $f$ is blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). $t$ is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport. Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection points of the graphs?

CHOICES:
A.They mean that one airplane was initially higher than the other airplane.
B.They mean that the airplanes reached the same height when they were both at 10,000 meters.
C.They give the solutions to the equation $f(t)=0$.
D.They give the solutions to the equation $f(t)=g(t)$.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's carefully analyze the given information and the graph:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are given two piecewise functions $ f(t) $ and $ g(t) $, which represent the heights of two airplanes over time $ t $. The graph shows the behavior of these functions:
- $ g(t) $ (purple line): Passes through points (0, 10000), (40, 9000), (80, 9000), (100, 11000), and (130, 11000).
- $ f(t) $ (blue line): Passes through points (10, 11000), (50, 11000), (60, 10000), (100, 10000), and (120, 0).

The question asks about the **intersection points** of the graphs of $ f(t) $ and $ g(t) $. Intersection points occur where the heights of the two airplanes are equal, i.e., where $ f(t) = g(t) $.

### Step 2: Analyze the Graph
From the graph:
1. The purple line ($ g(t) $) and the blue line ($ f(t) $) intersect at certain points.
2. At these intersection points, the heights of the two airplanes are the same.

### Step 3: Interpret the Intersection Points
The intersection points of the graphs of $ f(t) $ and $ g(t) $ represent the times $ t $ when the heights of the two airplanes are equal. Mathematically, these points are the solutions to the equation $ f(t) = g(t) $.

### Step 4: Evaluate Each Statement
Let's evaluate each answer choice:
- **A. They mean that one airplane was initially higher than the other airplane.**
  - This statement is not necessarily true. The initial heights of the airplanes are different, but the intersection points do not specifically indicate which airplane was initially higher. Instead, they show when the heights became equal.
  - **Eliminate A.**

- **B. They mean that the airplanes reached the same height when they were both at 10,000 meters.**
  - While it is true that the intersection points show when the airplanes reached the same height, the specific height (e.g., 10,000 meters) is not universally applicable to all intersection points. Some intersections may occur at other heights.
  - **Eliminate B.**

- **C. They give the solutions to the equation $ f(t) = 0 $.**
  - This statement is incorrect because the intersection points are where $ f(t) = g(t) $, not where $ f(t) = 0 $. The point where $ f(t) = 0 $ is a separate feature of the graph (at $ t = 120 $), but it is not related to the intersection points.
  - **Eliminate C.**

- **D. They give the solutions to the equation $ f(t) = g(t) $.**
  - This statement is correct. The intersection points of the graphs are precisely the times $ t $ when $ f(t) = g(t) $, as they represent the moments when the heights of the two airplanes are equal.
  - **Keep D.**

### Final Answer:
The correct interpretation of the intersection points is that they give the solutions to the equation $ f(t) = g(t) $.

Final Answer: D
