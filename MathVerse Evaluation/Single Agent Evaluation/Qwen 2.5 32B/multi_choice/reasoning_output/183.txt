### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of the tangent segment \( PC \) in the given geometric configuration. Here's a breakdown of the information provided:

- Circle \( O \) has a radius of \( 2.0 \).
- \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle.
- The angle between the diameter \( AB \) and the chord \( AC \) is \( 30^\circ \).
- \( PC \) is a tangent to the circle at point \( C \), and it intersects the extended line of \( AB \) at point \( P \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- Since \( AB \) is the diameter, the center of the circle \( O \) is the midpoint of \( AB \).
- The radius \( OC \) is perpendicular to the tangent \( PC \) at the point of tangency \( C \). This means \( \angle OCP = 90^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle AOC \) is twice the angle \( \angle ABC \) because \( \angle AOC \) is the central angle subtended by the same arc as \( \angle ABC \). However, we do not need this directly here.

#### Step 2: Use the Right Triangle \( OCP \)
- Since \( OC \) is a radius of the circle, \( OC = 2 \).
- \( \angle OCP = 90^\circ \), so \( \triangle OCP \) is a right triangle.
- The angle \( \angle COP \) is the same as the angle between the diameter \( AB \) and the chord \( AC \), which is given as \( 30^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Apply Trigonometry
In the right triangle \( OCP \):
- \( OC \) is the adjacent side to \( \angle COP \).
- \( PC \) is the opposite side to \( \angle COP \).
- We can use the tangent function:
  \[
  \tan(\angle COP) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{PC}{OC}
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{PC}{2}
  \]
  We know that \( \tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \). Therefore:
  \[
  \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{PC}{2}
  \]
  Solving for \( PC \):
  \[
  PC = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}
  \]

#### Step 4: Verify and Select the Answer
The length of \( PC \) is \( 2\sqrt{3} \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 4
- B: \( 4\sqrt{3} \)
- C: 6
- D: \( 2\sqrt{3} \)

The correct answer is \( 2\sqrt{3} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
