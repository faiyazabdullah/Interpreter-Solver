QUESTION:
A polynomial function p is graphed, which goes through (-5,0), (-1.5,0), (2,0). What could be the equation of p?

CHOICES:
A:p(x)=(x+5)(2 x+3)(x-2)
B:p(x)=(x-5)(2 x-3)(x+2)
C:p(x)=(-5 x)\left(-\frac{3}{2} x\right)(2 x)
D:p(x)=(5 x)\left(\frac{3}{2} x\right)(-2 x)

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the equation of the polynomial function \( p(x) \) based on the given roots and the behavior of the graph.

### Step 1: Identify the Roots
From the graph, the polynomial \( p(x) \) intersects the x-axis at the points:
- \( x = -5 \)
- \( x = -1.5 \)
- \( x = 2 \)

These points are the roots of the polynomial. Therefore, the polynomial can be expressed as:
\[ p(x) = k(x + 5)(x + 1.5)(x - 2) \]
where \( k \) is a constant.

### Step 2: Match the Roots to the Given Choices
We need to check which of the given choices matches the form \( p(x) = k(x + 5)(x + 1.5)(x - 2) \).

#### Choice A: \( p(x) = (x + 5)(2x + 3)(x - 2) \)
- The factors are \( (x + 5) \), \( (2x + 3) \), and \( (x - 2) \).
- The root from \( 2x + 3 = 0 \) is \( x = -\frac{3}{2} = -1.5 \).
- This matches the roots \( x = -5 \), \( x = -1.5 \), and \( x = 2 \).

#### Choice B: \( p(x) = (x - 5)(2x - 3)(x + 2) \)
- The factors are \( (x - 5) \), \( (2x - 3) \), and \( (x + 2) \).
- The root from \( 2x - 3 = 0 \) is \( x = \frac{3}{2} \).
- This does not match the roots \( x = -5 \), \( x = -1.5 \), and \( x = 2 \).

#### Choice C: \( p(x) = (-5x)\left(-\frac{3}{2}x\right)(2x) \)
- The factors are \( -5x \), \( -\frac{3}{2}x \), and \( 2x \).
- These are not linear factors corresponding to the roots \( x = -5 \), \( x = -1.5 \), and \( x = 2 \).

#### Choice D: \( p(x) = (5x)\left(\frac{3}{2}x\right)(-2x) \)
- The factors are \( 5x \), \( \frac{3}{2}x \), and \( -2x \).
- These are not linear factors corresponding to the roots \( x = -5 \), \( x = -1.5 \), and \( x = 2 \).

### Step 3: Verify the Correct Choice
Choice A matches the form \( p(x) = k(x + 5)(x + 1.5)(x - 2) \) with the correct roots. The constant \( k \) is not specified, but it does not affect the roots.

### Final Answer:
