### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure and Given Information
The image shows a quadratic function \( g(x) \) that opens downward. Key points provided are:
- The vertex of the parabola is at \( (-3, 0) \).
- The function passes through the points \( (-1, -4) \) and \( (-5, -4) \).

From the graph, we can infer:
- Since the parabola opens downward, the coefficient of \( x^2 \) in the quadratic equation is negative.
- The vertex form of a quadratic function is \( g(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex. Here, \( (h, k) = (-3, 0) \), so the equation becomes:
  \[
  g(x) = a(x + 3)^2
  \]

#### Step 2: Use the Points to Find the Coefficient \( a \)
We know the function passes through \( (-1, -4) \). Substituting \( x = -1 \) and \( g(-1) = -4 \) into the equation:
\[
g(-1) = a(-1 + 3)^2 = a(2)^2 = 4a
\]
Since \( g(-1) = -4 \):
\[
4a = -4 \implies a = -1
\]
Thus, the equation of the quadratic function is:
\[
g(x) = -1(x + 3)^2 = -(x + 3)^2
\]

#### Step 3: Expand the Quadratic Function
Expanding \( g(x) = -(x + 3)^2 \):
\[
g(x) = -(x^2 + 6x + 9) = -x^2 - 6x - 9
\]
So, the standard form of the quadratic function is:
\[
g(x) = -x^2 - 6x - 9
\]

#### Step 4: Determine the Discriminant
The discriminant of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
For \( g(x) = -x^2 - 6x - 9 \), the coefficients are:
- \( a = -1 \)
- \( b = -6 \)
- \( c = -9 \)

Substitute these values into the discriminant formula:
\[
\Delta = (-6)^2 - 4(-1)(-9) = 36 - 4(1)(9) = 36 - 36 = 0
\]

#### Step 5: Interpret the Discriminant
The discriminant \( \Delta = 0 \) indicates that the quadratic function has exactly one real root (the vertex touches the x-axis). This is consistent with the given information that the vertex is at \( (-3, 0) \), and the parabola does not cross the x-axis at any other point.

#### Step 6: Select the Correct Answer
Since the discriminant is zero, the correct choice is:
\[
\text{Final Answer: B}
\]

Final Answer: B
