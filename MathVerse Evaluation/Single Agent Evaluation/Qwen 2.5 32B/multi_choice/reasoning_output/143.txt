### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**
We are tasked with finding the side length of a square $DEFG$ that is inscribed in the triangle $ABC$. Here are the key pieces of information:
- $BC = 12$
- $AH \perp BC$, where $H$ is the foot of the perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$, and $AH = 8$.
- $DEFG$ is a square, with:
  - $G$ and $F$ on $BC$,
  - $D$ on $AB$,
  - $E$ on $AC$,
  - $M$ is the point where $AH$ intersects $DE$.
- We need to find the side length of the square $DEFG$.

#### **Step 2: Define Variables**
Let the side length of the square $DEFG$ be $x$. Since $DEFG$ is a square, all its sides are equal, and $DE = EF = FG = GD = x$.

#### **Step 3: Use Similar Triangles**
The square $DEFG$ is inscribed in the triangle $ABC$, and the line segment $DE$ is parallel to $BC$. This implies that the triangles $ADE$ and $ABC$ are similar by AA similarity (both have right angles at $H$ and $M$, and share $\angle BAC$).

From the similarity of triangles $ADE$ and $ABC$, we have:
\[
\frac{DE}{BC} = \frac{AM}{AH}
\]
Here:
- $DE = x$ (side length of the square),
- $BC = 12$,
- $AH = 8$,
- $AM = AH - HM$, where $HM$ is the height from $M$ to $DE$.

Since $M$ is the midpoint of $DE$ (because $AH \perp BC$ and $DE \parallel BC$), the height from $A$ to $DE$ is $AM = AH - x$ (since the square's height from $H$ to $M$ is $x$).

Thus:
\[
AM = AH - x = 8 - x
\]

#### **Step 4: Set Up the Proportion**
Using the similarity ratio:
\[
\frac{DE}{BC} = \frac{AM}{AH} \implies \frac{x}{12} = \frac{8 - x}{8}
\]

#### **Step 5: Solve the Equation**
Cross-multiply to solve for $x$:
\[
x \cdot 8 = 12 \cdot (8 - x)
\]
\[
8x = 96 - 12x
\]
Add $12x$ to both sides:
\[
8x + 12x = 96
\]
\[
20x = 96
\]
Divide both sides by 20:
\[
x = \frac{96}{20} = \frac{24}{5}
\]

#### **Step 6: Verify the Answer**
The side length of the square $DEFG$ is $x = \frac{24}{5}$. This value satisfies the similarity condition and the geometric constraints of the problem.

#### **Step 7: Select the Correct Choice**
The calculated side length of the square is $\frac{24}{5}$, which corresponds to choice A.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
