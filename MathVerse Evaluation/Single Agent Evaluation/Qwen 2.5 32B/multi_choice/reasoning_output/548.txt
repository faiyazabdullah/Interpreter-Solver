QUESTION:
Emile is observing a wind turbine. The vertical distance between the ground and the tip of one of the turbine's blades, in meters, is modeled by $H(t)$ where $t$ is the time in seconds. The function is graphed below, along with one segment highlighted. What is the meaning of the highlighted segment?

CHOICES:
A:The turbine's center is 35 meters above the ground.
B:The turbine completes a single cycle in 35 seconds.
C:The length of the blade is 35 meters.
D:The turbine has 35 blades.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves interpreting a graph that models the vertical distance \( H(t) \) between the ground and the tip of a wind turbine blade as a function of time \( t \). The highlighted segment in the graph is a horizontal line at \( y = 35 \). We need to determine the meaning of this segment.

#### Step 1: Examine the Graph
- The graph shows a periodic function \( H(t) \), which oscillates over time.
- The vertical axis represents the height \( H(t) \) in meters.
- The horizontal axis represents time \( t \) in seconds.
- The highlighted segment is a horizontal line at \( y = 35 \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Function
- The function \( H(t) \) represents the height of the tip of the turbine blade above the ground.
- The oscillatory nature of the graph indicates that the turbine blade is rotating, causing the height to vary periodically.
- The highlighted segment at \( y = 35 \) suggests a constant value for \( H(t) \).

#### Step 3: Interpret the Highlighted Segment
- The highlighted segment at \( y = 35 \) does not correspond to a specific point on the graph but rather represents a constant height.
- In the context of a wind turbine, the constant height \( y = 35 \) likely represents the center of rotation of the turbine blade (i.e., the height of the turbine's hub above the ground).

#### Step 4: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
- **Choice A**: "The turbine's center is 35 meters above the ground."
  - This interpretation makes sense because the highlighted segment at \( y = 35 \) represents a constant height, which is typically the height of the turbine's hub (center of rotation).
  
- **Choice B**: "The turbine completes a single cycle in 35 seconds."
  - The highlighted segment does not represent a period of the function. Instead, it represents a constant height. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  
- **Choice C**: "The length of the blade is 35 meters."
  - The length of the blade would be the amplitude of the oscillation, not the constant height represented by the highlighted segment. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.
  
- **Choice D**: "The turbine has 35 blades."
  - The number of blades is not related to the highlighted segment at \( y = 35 \). Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

#### Step 5: Conclusion
The highlighted segment at \( y = 35 \) most logically represents the height of the turbine's hub above the ground, which is the center of rotation for the blades.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
