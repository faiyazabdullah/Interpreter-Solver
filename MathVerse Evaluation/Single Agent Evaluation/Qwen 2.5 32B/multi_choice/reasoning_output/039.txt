QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's carefully analyze the given geometric figure step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- We are folding a rectangular piece of paper.
- Angle 1 is given as \(140^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of angle 2.

### Step 2: Analyze the geometric relationships
When a piece of paper is folded, the fold creates a line of symmetry. This means that the angles on either side of the fold are related by the properties of reflection and straight lines.

#### Key observations:
1. **Straight line property**: The sum of angles on a straight line is \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the angle adjacent to angle 1 (on the same straight line) is:
   \[
   180^\circ - 140^\circ = 40^\circ
   \]
   Let's call this adjacent angle "angle A".

2. **Reflection property**: When the paper is folded, angle 2 is formed by the reflection of angle A across the fold. Since angle A is \(40^\circ\) and it is reflected, angle 2 will be twice the size of angle A because the fold creates two identical angles that add up to angle 2.

### Step 3: Calculate angle 2
Since angle A is \(40^\circ\) and angle 2 is the sum of two such angles (due to the reflection):
\[
\text{Angle 2} = 2 \times 40^\circ = 80^\circ
\]
However, we need to consider the total angle formed by the fold, which is the supplementary angle to the \(80^\circ\) angle. Therefore, angle 2 is:
\[
180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Verify the calculation
- Angle 1 is \(140^\circ\).
- The adjacent angle to angle 1 is \(40^\circ\).
- When the paper is folded, angle 2 is the supplementary angle to the \(80^\circ\) angle formed by the reflection, which is \(100^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
The degree of angle 2 is \(100^\circ\).
