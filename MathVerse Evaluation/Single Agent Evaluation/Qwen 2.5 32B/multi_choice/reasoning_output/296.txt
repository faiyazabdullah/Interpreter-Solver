CHOICES:
A:2
B:5
C:6
D:9

### Analysis of the Problem:
The image shows an equilateral triangle, which means all three sides of the triangle are equal in length. The problem states that two sides of the triangle are given as \(2x + 11\) and \(6x - 9\). Since it is an equilateral triangle, these two sides must be equal.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The triangle is equilateral.
   - Two sides are given as \(2x + 11\) and \(6x - 9\).
   - In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the triangle is equilateral, the two given sides must be equal:
   \[
   2x + 11 = 6x - 9
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   - Subtract \(2x\) from both sides:
     \[
     11 = 4x - 9
     \]
   - Add 9 to both sides:
     \[
     20 = 4x
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - Substitute \(x = 5\) back into the expressions for the sides:
     \[
     2x + 11 = 2(5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21
     \]
     \[
     6x - 9 = 6(5) - 9 = 30 - 9 = 21
     \]
   - Both sides are equal, confirming that the triangle is indeed equilateral when \(x = 5\).

5. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   The calculated value of \(x\) is 5, which matches choice B.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
