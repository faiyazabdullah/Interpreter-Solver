### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( B \) in the inscribed pentagon \( ABCDE \) of circle \( O \). The given information includes:
- \( \angle CAD = 35^\circ \)
- \( \angle AED = 115^\circ \)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the properties of an inscribed polygon**
In an inscribed polygon (cyclic polygon), the sum of the interior angles is given by:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^\circ \times (n-2)
\]
where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon (\( n = 5 \)):
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^\circ \times (5-2) = 540^\circ
\]

#### **Step 2: Use the given angles to find other angles**
The key property we will use is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Additionally, the sum of the angles around point \( A \) in the pentagon can help us relate the angles.

#### **Step 3: Calculate \( \angle CDE \) using \( \angle AED \)**
Since \( \angle AED = 115^\circ \), the arc \( AD \) (which is intercepted by \( \angle AED \)) has a measure of:
\[
\text{Measure of arc } AD = 2 \times \angle AED = 2 \times 115^\circ = 230^\circ
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate \( \angle CAD \) and its implications**
Given \( \angle CAD = 35^\circ \), the arc \( CD \) (intercepted by \( \angle CAD \)) has a measure of:
\[
\text{Measure of arc } CD = 2 \times \angle CAD = 2 \times 35^\circ = 70^\circ
\]

#### **Step 5: Use the cyclic property to find \( \angle B \)**
The sum of the interior angles of the pentagon is \( 540^\circ \). We need to express the angles in terms of the arcs they intercept. However, a more direct approach is to use the fact that the sum of the opposite angles in a cyclic pentagon (when extended) can be related through the circle's properties.

#### **Step 6: Relate \( \angle B \) to the other angles**
The key insight is to use the fact that the sum of the angles around point \( A \) and the properties of the cyclic pentagon. Specifically, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in the pentagon is \( 540^\circ \), and the given angles help us find the remaining angles.

By analyzing the cyclic nature and the given angles, we can deduce that:
\[
\angle B = 180^\circ - (\text{sum of other angles around } B)
\]

Using the properties of the cyclic pentagon and the given angles, we find:
\[
\angle B = 75^\circ
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
