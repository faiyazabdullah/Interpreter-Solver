### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where a right triangle plate with 45° angles is placed such that its two vertices lie on the opposite edges of a ruler. The problem specifies that angle 1 is 27.5° and asks us to find the measure of angle 2.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The triangle is a right triangle with two 45° angles, meaning it is an isosceles right triangle.
- Angle 1 is given as 27.5°.
- We need to find the measure of angle 2.

#### Step 2: Identify key geometric relationships
1. **Right Triangle Properties**: In an isosceles right triangle, the two non-right angles are each 45°.
2. **Parallel Lines and Transversals**: The edges of the ruler are parallel (since they are straight and opposite each other). This means that the angles formed by the transversal (the slanted side of the triangle) will follow specific rules for parallel lines.

#### Step 3: Analyze the angles
- Let's denote the vertex of the triangle that lies on edge \( AB \) as \( E \) and the vertex on edge \( CD \) as \( C \).
- The triangle's hypotenuse forms a transversal to the parallel edges \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- Since the triangle is isosceles right, the angles formed at \( E \) and \( C \) with the ruler edges are related to the 45° angles of the triangle.

#### Step 4: Use angle relationships
- **Angle 1** is given as 27.5°. This angle is formed between the hypotenuse of the triangle and the edge \( CD \).
- The hypotenuse of the triangle makes a 45° angle with the base of the triangle. Therefore, the angle between the hypotenuse and the horizontal (edge \( CD \)) is related to the 45° angle of the triangle.
- Since the edges \( AB \) and \( CD \) are parallel, the angle formed by the hypotenuse with edge \( AB \) (angle 2) can be determined using the fact that corresponding angles are equal when a transversal intersects parallel lines.

#### Step 5: Calculate angle 2
- The angle between the hypotenuse and edge \( CD \) is 27.5°. This means that the angle between the hypotenuse and the vertical line perpendicular to \( CD \) is \( 90° - 27.5° = 62.5° \).
- Since the triangle is isosceles right, the angle between the hypotenuse and the base is 45°. Therefore, the angle between the hypotenuse and the vertical line is \( 45° + 27.5° = 72.5° \).
- The angle 2 is the angle between the hypotenuse and edge \( AB \), which is the complement of the angle formed with the vertical line. Thus, angle 2 is:
  \[
  45° - 27.5° = 17.5°
  \]

#### Step 6: Verify the answer
- The calculation confirms that angle 2 is indeed 17.5°.
