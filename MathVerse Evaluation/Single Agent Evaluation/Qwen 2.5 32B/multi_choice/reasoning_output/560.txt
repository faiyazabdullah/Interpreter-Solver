QUESTION:
This is a quadratic function. The y-axis labels mosquitoes (millions), and x-axis labels rainfall (centimeters). The vertex of the function is (2,4) and the function intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (4,0). Which of these statements are true?

CHOICES:
A:The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 2 million mosquitoes.
B:The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 4 million mosquitoes.
C:More rainfall always relates to less mosquitoes.
D:More rainfall relates to less mosquitoes as long as rainfall is less than $2 \mathrm{~cm}$.

### Analysis of the Problem:
The given image shows a quadratic function \( g \) that models the relationship between rainfall (in centimeters) and the number of mosquitoes (in millions). Key points from the graph are:

1. **Vertex**: The highest point of the parabola is at \((2, 4)\). This indicates that the maximum number of mosquitoes occurs when the rainfall is 2 cm, and the maximum value is 4 million mosquitoes.
2. **x-intercepts**: The function intersects the x-axis at \((0, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\). This means that when rainfall is 0 cm or 4 cm, the number of mosquitoes is 0.
3. **Shape**: The parabola opens downward, indicating that the number of mosquitoes decreases as rainfall moves away from the optimal value of 2 cm.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
#### Statement A: The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 2 million mosquitoes.
- From the graph, the vertex of the parabola is at \((2, 4)\). This means the maximum number of mosquitoes is 4 million, not 2 million.
- Therefore, **Statement A is false**.

#### Statement B: The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 4 million mosquitoes.
- The vertex of the parabola is at \((2, 4)\), which confirms that the maximum number of mosquitoes is indeed 4 million.
- Therefore, **Statement B is true**.

#### Statement C: More rainfall always relates to less mosquitoes.
- The parabola shows that the number of mosquitoes increases initially as rainfall increases from 0 cm to 2 cm. However, beyond 2 cm, the number of mosquitoes decreases. Therefore, more rainfall does not always relate to fewer mosquitoes.
- Therefore, **Statement C is false**.

#### Statement D: More rainfall relates to less mosquitoes as long as rainfall is less than 2 cm.
- The graph shows that the number of mosquitoes increases as rainfall increases from 0 cm to 2 cm. Beyond 2 cm, the number of mosquitoes decreases. This means that more rainfall relates to fewer mosquitoes only when rainfall is greater than 2 cm.
- Therefore, **Statement D is false**.

### Final Answer:
Based on the analysis, the only true statement is **B**.

Final Answer: B
