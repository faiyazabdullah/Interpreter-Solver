### Problem Analysis:
We are given the following information from the image and problem statement:
1. **AB is parallel to CD**.
2. **EF is a transversal line intersecting AB at point E and CD at point F**.
3. **EG bisects ∠BEF**.
4. **∠1 = 50°**, where ∠1 is the angle formed between line FG and line CD.
5. We need to find the measure of ∠2, which is the angle formed between line EG and line CD.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify Key Angles and Relationships
- Since AB is parallel to CD, and EF is a transversal, we can use the properties of corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles.
- ∠1 is given as 50°. This means ∠EFG = 50° because ∠1 and ∠EFG are vertical angles (vertical angles are congruent).

#### Step 2: Use the Property of Parallel Lines
- Since AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, ∠BEF (the angle formed between AB and EF) is supplementary to ∠EFG (the angle formed between CD and EF).
- Therefore, ∠BEF + ∠EFG = 180°.
- Substituting ∠EFG = 50°:
  \[
  ∠BEF + 50° = 180° \implies ∠BEF = 130°.
  \]

#### Step 3: Use the Angle Bisector Property
- EG bisects ∠BEF. This means that ∠BEG = ∠FEG.
- Since ∠BEF = 130°, we have:
  \[
  ∠BEG = ∠FEG = \frac{130°}{2} = 65°.
  \]

#### Step 4: Determine ∠2
- ∠2 is the angle between line EG and line CD. Since AB || CD, and EG is a line intersecting both AB and CD, ∠2 is congruent to ∠FEG (corresponding angles).
- From the previous step, we know ∠FEG = 65°.
- Therefore, ∠2 = 65°.

### Final Answer:
