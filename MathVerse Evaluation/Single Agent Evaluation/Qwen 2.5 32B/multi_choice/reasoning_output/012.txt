To solve the problem, let's analyze the geometric relationships and apply the necessary theorems step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
1. **Parallel Lines**: $AB \parallel CD$.
2. **Right Triangle**: $\triangle DEF$ is a right triangle with $\angle EDF = 90^\circ$.
3. **Angle Relationship**: $\angle 1 + \angle F = 70^\circ$.
4. **Objective**: Find the measure of $\angle 2$.

### Step 2: Label and Analyze the Figure
- Since $AB \parallel CD$, we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals.
- $\angle 1$ is an angle formed by the transversal $BF$ intersecting the parallel lines $AB$ and $CD$.
- $\angle F$ is an angle in the right triangle $\triangle DEF$.
- $\angle 2$ is the angle formed between the line $ED$ and the line $CD$.

### Step 3: Use Parallel Line Properties
Since $AB \parallel CD$, the alternate interior angles are equal. Specifically:
- $\angle 1$ (on line $AB$) and its corresponding angle on line $CD$ are equal. Let's call this corresponding angle $\angle 3$. Thus, $\angle 3 = \angle 1$.

### Step 4: Use the Right Triangle Property
In $\triangle DEF$, we know:
- $\angle EDF = 90^\circ$.
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$. Therefore:
  $$
  \angle DEF + \angle F + \angle EDF = 180^\circ.
  $$
  Substituting $\angle EDF = 90^\circ$, we get:
  $$
  \angle DEF + \angle F + 90^\circ = 180^\circ \implies \angle DEF + \angle F = 90^\circ.
  $$

### Step 5: Relate $\angle 1$ and $\angle F$
We are given that:
$$
\angle 1 + \angle F = 70^\circ.
$$
From the right triangle property, we know:
$$
\angle DEF + \angle F = 90^\circ.
$$
Since $\angle DEF$ is part of the larger angle $\angle 3$ (which is equal to $\angle 1$), we can use the relationship between these angles. Notice that:
$$
\angle 3 = \angle 1.
$$
Thus, $\angle 3$ is also part of the larger angle formed by the transversal and the parallel lines.

### Step 6: Determine $\angle 2$
Since $AB \parallel CD$, the angle $\angle 2$ is the exterior angle to the angle $\angle 3$ (which is equal to $\angle 1$). Therefore:
$$
\angle 2 = 90^\circ - \angle 3.
$$
From the given information:
$$
\angle 1 + \angle F = 70^\circ \implies \angle 3 + \angle F = 70^\circ.
$$
Since $\angle DEF + \angle F = 90^\circ$, we can find $\angle DEF$:
$$
\angle DEF = 90^\circ - \angle F.
$$
But $\angle 3 = \angle 1$, so:
$$
\angle 3 = 70^\circ - \angle F.
$$
Thus:
$$
\angle 2 = 90^\circ - \angle 3 = 90^\circ - (70^\circ - \angle F) = 90^\circ - 70^\circ + \angle F = 20^\circ + \angle F - \angle F = 20^\circ.
$$

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{A}
$$
