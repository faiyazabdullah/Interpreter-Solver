To solve the problem, we will use the concept of similar triangles and proportions. Let's go through the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The light source $P$ is directly above the crossbar $AB$.
- The shadow of $AB$ under the light is $CD$, and $AB \parallel CD$.
- The length of $AB$ is $2.0$.
- The length of $CD$ is $5.0$.
- The distance from $P$ to $CD$ is $3.0$.
- We need to find the distance between $AB$ and $CD$.

### Step 2: Define variables and set up the diagram
Let:
- $h$ be the height of the light source $P$ above the plane containing $CD$.
- $x$ be the distance between $AB$ and $CD$.

From the problem, we know:
- $h = 3.0$ (distance from $P$ to $CD$).
- The triangles formed by the light source and the segments $AB$ and $CD$ are similar because $AB \parallel CD$.

### Step 3: Use similar triangles
Since $AB \parallel CD$, the triangles $\triangle PAB$ and $\triangle PCD$ are similar. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal. Specifically, the ratio of the lengths of the segments $AB$ and $CD$ is equal to the ratio of the heights of the triangles from the light source $P$.

The height of $\triangle PAB$ is $h - x$ (since $x$ is the distance from $AB$ to $CD$), and the height of $\triangle PCD$ is $h$. Therefore, the similarity ratio gives us:
\[
\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{h - x}{h}.
\]

Substitute the known values:
- $AB = 2.0$,
- $CD = 5.0$,
- $h = 3.0$.

This gives:
\[
\frac{2.0}{5.0} = \frac{3.0 - x}{3.0}.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for $x$
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{2}{5} = \frac{3 - x}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for $x$:
\[
2 \cdot 3 = 5 \cdot (3 - x) \implies 6 = 15 - 5x.
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate $x$:
\[
5x = 15 - 6 \implies 5x = 9 \implies x = \frac{9}{5}.
\]

### Step 5: Verify the answer
The distance between $AB$ and $CD$ is $x = \frac{9}{5}$. This matches one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
