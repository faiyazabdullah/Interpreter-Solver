### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- **Angles provided:**
  - Angle 1 = 100°
  - Angle 2 = 100°
  - Angle 3 = 125°
- **Lines involved:** 
  - Lines \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) are shown in the figure.
  - Lines \(c\) and \(d\) appear to be intersecting lines, while lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel (as indicated by the equal corresponding angles).

#### **Step 2: Identify key geometric relationships**
1. **Parallel lines and transversals:**
   - Since angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles and both are equal to 100°, lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel.
   - When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

2. **Focus on angle 3 and angle 4:**
   - Angle 3 is given as 125°. It is formed by the intersection of lines \(c\) and \(d\).
   - Angle 4 is the angle adjacent to angle 3 on the same side of line \(d\).

#### **Step 3: Use the property of supplementary angles**
- Angles 3 and 4 are supplementary because they form a linear pair (they lie on a straight line).
- The sum of supplementary angles is 180°.
- Therefore, we can write:
  \[
  \text{Angle 3} + \text{Angle 4} = 180°
  \]
- Substituting the given value of angle 3:
  \[
  125° + \text{Angle 4} = 180°
  \]

#### **Step 4: Solve for angle 4**
- Rearrange the equation to solve for angle 4:
  \[
  \text{Angle 4} = 180° - 125°
  \]
  \[
  \text{Angle 4} = 55°
  \]

#### **Step 5: Verify the result**
- The calculation is consistent with the properties of supplementary angles.
- Angle 4 is correctly determined as 55°.

#### **Step 6: Match the result with the answer choices**
- The calculated value of angle 4 is 55°.
- The answer choice that matches 55° is **D**.

### Final Answer:
