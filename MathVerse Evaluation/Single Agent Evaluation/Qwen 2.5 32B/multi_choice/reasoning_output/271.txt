### Problem Analysis:
We are given two congruent circles, \( \odot P \) and \( \odot Q \). The key pieces of information are:
- Chord \( RS \) on \( \odot P \) has a length of \( 3x \).
- Chord \( TU \) on \( \odot Q \) has a length of \( 7x - 44 \).
- Since the circles are congruent, their radii are equal, and corresponding chords of equal lengths will have equal lengths.

We need to find the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Congruence of Circles
Since \( \odot P \cong \odot Q \), the radii of both circles are equal. This implies that corresponding chords in these circles will have the same length if they subtend equal arcs or are positioned similarly relative to the center.

#### Step 2: Equate the Lengths of Corresponding Chords
Given that the circles are congruent, the lengths of the chords \( RS \) and \( TU \) must be equal because they are corresponding chords in congruent circles. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
3x = 7x - 44
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
To solve for \( x \), we rearrange the equation:
\[
3x = 7x - 44
\]
Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:
\[
0 = 4x - 44
\]
Add 44 to both sides:
\[
44 = 4x
\]
Divide both sides by 4:
\[
x = 11
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 11 \) back into the expressions for the chord lengths:
- Length of \( RS \): \( 3x = 3(11) = 33 \)
- Length of \( TU \): \( 7x - 44 = 7(11) - 44 = 77 - 44 = 33 \)

Both lengths are equal, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
