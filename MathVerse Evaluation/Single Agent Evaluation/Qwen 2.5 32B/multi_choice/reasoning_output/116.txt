QUESTION:
The picture shows a small paper cap with a conical chimney. The length of its generatrix l is 13.0 and its height h is 12.0. The area of ​​paper required to make this paper cap is (the seams are ignored) ()

CHOICES:
A:60π
B:65π
C:78π
D:156π

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the paper required to make the conical chimney. This involves calculating the lateral surface area of the cone.

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The length of the generatrix \( l \) (slant height) of the cone is 13.
- The height \( h \) of the cone is 12.
- We need to find the lateral surface area of the cone.

### Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius \( r \)
The generatrix \( l \), height \( h \), and radius \( r \) form a right triangle. According to the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
l^2 = r^2 + h^2
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
13^2 = r^2 + 12^2
\]
\[
169 = r^2 + 144
\]
Solve for \( r^2 \):
\[
r^2 = 169 - 144
\]
\[
r^2 = 25
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
r = 5
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the lateral surface area of the cone
The formula for the lateral surface area \( A \) of a cone is:
\[
A = \pi r l
\]
Substitute the values of \( r \) and \( l \):
\[
A = \pi \cdot 5 \cdot 13
\]
\[
A = 65\pi
\]

### Step 4: Compare the result with the answer choices
The calculated lateral surface area is \( 65\pi \). This matches option B.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
