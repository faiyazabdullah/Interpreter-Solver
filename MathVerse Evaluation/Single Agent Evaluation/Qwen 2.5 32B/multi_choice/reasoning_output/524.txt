### Analysis of the Problem:
We are tasked with determining the y-coordinate of point \( A \) on a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a radius of 1 unit. The circle is described by the equation:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
Point \( A \) lies on the circle, and its position is indicated in the diagram. From the diagram, we observe that point \( A \) is located directly below the origin, along the negative y-axis. This means the coordinates of point \( A \) are \((0, -1)\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Position of Point \( A \):**
   - Point \( A \) is on the circle and lies directly below the origin.
   - The x-coordinate of \( A \) is 0 because it lies on the y-axis.
   - The y-coordinate of \( A \) is negative because it is below the origin.
   - Therefore, the coordinates of \( A \) are \((0, -1)\).

2. **Use Trigonometric Representation:**
   - Any point on the unit circle can be represented in terms of an angle \( \theta \) as \((\cos \theta, \sin \theta)\).
   - For point \( A \), the angle \( \theta \) corresponds to the direction from the positive x-axis to the point \( A \).
   - Since \( A \) is directly below the origin, the angle \( \theta \) is \( 270^\circ \) (or \(-90^\circ\)).

3. **Calculate the Coordinates Using Trigonometry:**
   - The x-coordinate of \( A \) is given by \( \cos \theta \).
   - The y-coordinate of \( A \) is given by \( \sin \theta \).
   - For \( \theta = 270^\circ \):
     \[
     \cos(270^\circ) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin(270^\circ) = -1
     \]
   - Therefore, the coordinates of \( A \) are \((\cos(270^\circ), \sin(270^\circ)) = (0, -1)\).

4. **Determine the y-Coordinate:**
   - The y-coordinate of point \( A \) is \( \sin(270^\circ) \).

5. **Match with Answer Choices:**
   - The y-coordinate of point \( A \) is \( \sin(270^\circ) \).
   - From the answer choices, the correct option is:
     \[
     \text{E: } \sin(270^\circ)
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{E}
\]
