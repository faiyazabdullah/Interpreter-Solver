QUESTION:
Points $A, B$, and $C$ are plotted on the unit circle and also on the x-axis and y-axis. Which of the coordinates is equal to $\cos (\pi)$ ?

CHOICES:
A:$x$-coordinate of point $A$
B:$y$-coordinate of point $A$
C:$x$-coordinate of point $B$
D:$y$-coordinate of point $B$
E:$x$-coordinate of point $C$
F:$y$-coordinate of point $C$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use trigonometric concepts to determine which coordinate corresponds to $\cos(\pi)$.

### Step 1: Understanding the Unit Circle
The figure shows a unit circle centered at the origin $(0, 0)$. Points $A$, $B$, and $C$ are plotted on the unit circle and also on the axes:
- Point $A$ lies on the positive $x$-axis.
- Point $B$ lies on the positive $y$-axis.
- Point $C$ lies on the negative $x$-axis.

### Step 2: Coordinates of Points on the Unit Circle
On a unit circle, the coordinates of a point corresponding to an angle $\theta$ (measured counterclockwise from the positive $x$-axis) are:
$$
(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
$$
- For point $A$, which lies on the positive $x$-axis, the angle is $0$ radians. Thus, the coordinates are:
  $$
  A = (\cos 0, \sin 0) = (1, 0).
  $$
- For point $B$, which lies on the positive $y$-axis, the angle is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians. Thus, the coordinates are:
  $$
  B = (\cos \frac{\pi}{2}, \sin \frac{\pi}{2}) = (0, 1).
  $$
- For point $C$, which lies on the negative $x$-axis, the angle is $\pi$ radians. Thus, the coordinates are:
  $$
  C = (\cos \pi, \sin \pi) = (-1, 0).
  $$

### Step 3: Evaluating $\cos(\pi)$
From trigonometry, we know:
$$
\cos(\pi) = -1.
$$
This value corresponds to the $x$-coordinate of point $C$.

### Step 4: Matching with Answer Choices
Now, let's match the value $\cos(\pi) = -1$ with the given answer choices:
- **A:** $x$-coordinate of point $A$: This is $1$ (not $-1$).
- **B:** $y$-coordinate of point $A$: This is $0$ (not $-1$).
- **C:** $x$-coordinate of point $B$: This is $0$ (not $-1$).
- **D:** $y$-coordinate of point $B$: This is $1$ (not $-1$).
- **E:** $x$-coordinate of point $C$: This is $-1$ (matches $\cos(\pi)$).
- **F:** $y$-coordinate of point $C$: This is $0$ (not $-1$).

### Final Answer:
The coordinate that equals $\cos(\pi)$ is the $x$-coordinate of point $C$.

$$
\boxed{E}
