QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in a badminton game, Lin Dan, the athlete standing at M in the field, clicks the request from N to point B in the opponent. It is known that the net height OA = 1.52, OB = 4.0, OM = 5.0, then when Lin Dan takes off, the distance from the hitting point to the ground NM = ()

CHOICES:
A:3.42m
B:1.9m
C:3m
D:3.24m

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the distance from the hitting point $ N $ to the ground $ M $ (i.e., $ NM $) in a badminton game scenario. The given information includes:
- The height of the net at point $ A $: $ OA = 1.52 $ meters.
- The horizontal distance from the net to point $ B $: $ OB = 4.0 $ meters.
- The horizontal distance from the net to point $ M $: $ OM = 5.0 $ meters.
- The vertical distance from the hitting point $ N $ to the ground $ M $: $ NM = ? $.

The geometric setup suggests a right triangle involving the points $ N $, $ O $, and $ A $. We will use similar triangles and proportions to solve for $ NM $.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify Similar Triangles:**
   - Consider the triangles $ \triangle NOA $ and $ \triangle NMB $. These triangles are similar because they share the same angle at $ N $ and both have right angles at $ O $ and $ M $, respectively.
   - Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
     $$
     \frac{OA}{OB} = \frac{NM}{OM}.
     $$

#### 2. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - From the problem, we know:
     $$
     OA = 1.52, \quad OB = 4.0, \quad OM = 5.0.
     $$
   - Let $ NM = h $. Then the proportion becomes:
     $$
     \frac{1.52}{4.0} = \frac{h}{5.0}.
     $$

#### 3. **Solve for $ h $:**
   - Cross-multiply to solve for $ h $:
     $$
     1.52 \cdot 5.0 = 4.0 \cdot h.
     $$
   - Simplify:
     $$
     7.6 = 4.0h.
     $$
   - Divide both sides by 4.0:
     $$
     h = \frac{7.6}{4.0} = 1.9.
     $$

#### 4. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance from the hitting point $ N $ to the ground $ M $ is $ NM = 1.9 $ meters.

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{B}
