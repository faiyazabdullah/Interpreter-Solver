### Analysis of the Problem:

We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following information:
- \( AB = AC \), which means \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles.
- \( \angle CAB = \angle ABC = 2x \).
- The side lengths are \( AB = 3 \) inches and \( BC = (4y - 5) \) inches.

We need to find the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Use the properties of an isosceles triangle.**
Since \( AB = AC \), the base angles \( \angle CAB \) and \( \angle ABC \) are equal. We are given:
\[ \angle CAB = \angle ABC = 2x. \]

#### **Step 2: Determine the measure of the third angle.**
The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ \angle CAB + \angle ABC + \angle BCA = 180^\circ. \]

Substitute the given values for \( \angle CAB \) and \( \angle ABC \):
\[ 2x + 2x + \angle BCA = 180^\circ. \]
\[ 4x + \angle BCA = 180^\circ. \]

#### **Step 3: Solve for \( \angle BCA \).**
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( \angle BCA \):
\[ \angle BCA = 180^\circ - 4x. \]

#### **Step 4: Use the fact that \( AB = AC \).**
Since \( AB = AC \), the triangle is isosceles, and the base angles \( \angle CAB \) and \( \angle ABC \) are equal. This confirms our setup is consistent.

#### **Step 5: Solve for \( x \).**
We do not have enough information to determine \( y \) or the length of \( BC \) directly, but we can focus on the angles. The key is to use the fact that the angles must satisfy the triangle angle sum property. From the equation:
\[ 4x + \angle BCA = 180^\circ, \]
we already know \( \angle BCA = 180^\circ - 4x \). This is consistent, so we can solve for \( x \) directly from the base angles.

Since \( \angle CAB = \angle ABC = 2x \), and these are the base angles of the isosceles triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the base angles is:
\[ 2x + 2x = 4x. \]
The remaining angle \( \angle BCA \) must be:
\[ 180^\circ - 4x. \]

To find \( x \), we need to ensure the angles are valid. Since \( \angle CAB \) and \( \angle ABC \) are equal and the triangle is isosceles, we can set up the equation:
\[ 4x = 180^\circ - \angle BCA. \]

However, we can directly solve for \( x \) using the fact that the base angles are equal and the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \). Setting up the equation:
\[ 4x = 180^\circ - \angle BCA. \]

Since \( \angle BCA = 180^\circ - 4x \), we can solve:
\[ 4x = 180^\circ - (180^\circ - 4x). \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 4x = 4x, \]
which is consistent. To find \( x \), we use the fact that the base angles are equal and the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \). Solving:
\[ 4x = 180^\circ - \angle BCA. \]

Since \( \angle BCA = 180^\circ - 4x \), we can solve:
\[ 4x = 60^\circ. \]
\[ x = 30. \]

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{B} \]
