QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, Xiaodong uses a bamboo pole with a length of 3.2 as a measuring tool to measure the height of the school flagpole, and moves the bamboo pole so that the shadow on the top of the pole and the flag pole falls on the same point on the ground. At this time, the distance between the bamboo pole and this point is 8.0, and the distance from the flag pole is 22.0, then the height of the flag pole is ()

CHOICES:
A:12m
B:10m
C:8m
D:7m

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves similar triangles formed by the bamboo pole, the flagpole, and their respective shadows. The key geometric principle here is the **property of similar triangles**, where corresponding sides are proportional.

#### Given Information:
1. Height of the bamboo pole: \( h_1 = 3.2 \) meters.
2. Distance from the bamboo pole to the point where the shadows meet: \( d_1 = 8 \) meters.
3. Distance from the flagpole to the point where the shadows meet: \( d_2 = 22 \) meters.
4. We need to find the height of the flagpole, denoted as \( H \).

#### Geometric Relationships:
- The bamboo pole and its shadow form one triangle.
- The flagpole and its shadow form another triangle.
- Since the sun's rays are parallel, these two triangles are **similar** by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.
- Therefore, the ratios of corresponding heights to their respective shadow lengths are equal:
  \[
  \frac{\text{Height of bamboo pole}}{\text{Shadow length of bamboo pole}} = \frac{\text{Height of flagpole}}{\text{Shadow length of flagpole}}
  \]

#### Shadow Lengths:
- The shadow length of the bamboo pole is the total distance from the base of the bamboo pole to the point where the shadows meet, which is \( d_1 = 8 \) meters.
- The shadow length of the flagpole is the total distance from the base of the flagpole to the point where the shadows meet, which is \( d_2 = 22 \) meters.

#### Setting Up the Proportion:
Using the property of similar triangles:
\[
\frac{h_1}{d_1} = \frac{H}{d_2}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{3.2}{8} = \frac{H}{22}
\]

#### Solving for \( H \):
1. Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[
   \frac{3.2}{8} = 0.4
   \]
2. Set up the equation:
   \[
   0.4 = \frac{H}{22}
   \]
3. Solve for \( H \) by cross-multiplying:
   \[
   H = 0.4 \times 22
   \]
   \[
   H = 8.8
   \]

#### Conclusion:
The height of the flagpole is \( 8.8 \) meters. However, since the answer choices are discrete, we need to compare our result with the provided options. The closest option to \( 8.8 \) meters is \( 8 \) meters.
