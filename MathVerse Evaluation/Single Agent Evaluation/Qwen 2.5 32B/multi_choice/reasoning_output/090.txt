====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the steps systematically:

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The figure shows a circle with center \( O \).
- \( \angle AOB = 50^\circ \), which is a central angle.
- We need to find the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \).

### Step 2: Understand the relationship between central and inscribed angles
A key property in circle geometry is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Measure of inscribed angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of central angle}
\]

### Step 3: Identify the relevant arc
- The central angle \( \angle AOB \) subtends the arc \( AB \).
- The inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) also subtends the same arc \( AB \).

### Step 4: Apply the property
Using the property mentioned above:
\[
\angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle AOB
\]
Substitute the given value of \( \angle AOB \):
\[
\angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \times 50^\circ = 25^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Verify the calculation
The calculation is straightforward and consistent with the geometric property. No further adjustments are needed.

### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( \angle ACB \) is \( 25^\circ \). This matches option B.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
