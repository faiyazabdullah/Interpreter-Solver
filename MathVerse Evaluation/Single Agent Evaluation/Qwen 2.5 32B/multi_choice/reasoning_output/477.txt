QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem using the vertical line test, let's follow the steps:

### Step 1: Examine the geometric figure
The image shows a curve that passes through the origin (0, 0). The curve extends to the left and right, and it appears to be continuous without any breaks. The curve does not intersect itself vertically at any point.

### Step 2: Understand the vertical line test
The vertical line test is used to determine whether a given relation is a function. According to this test:
- If any vertical line intersects the graph of the relation at **more than one point**, then the relation is **not a function**.
- If every vertical line intersects the graph of the relation at **most one point**, then the relation is **a function**.

### Step 3: Identify what needs to be found
We need to determine whether the given curve satisfies the vertical line test. This will help us decide if the relation represented by the curve is a function.

### Step 4: Apply the vertical line test
- Draw an imaginary vertical line at any position on the graph. For example, consider a vertical line passing through the origin (x = 0).
- Observe where this vertical line intersects the curve. In this case, the vertical line passing through x = 0 intersects the curve **only once** at the origin.
- Repeat this process for other vertical lines. For instance, draw a vertical line at x = 1 or x = -1. Each vertical line will intersect the curve **at most once**.

Since no vertical line intersects the curve at more than one point, the relation satisfies the vertical line test.

### Step 5: Show calculations (if applicable)
No explicit calculations are needed here, as the vertical line test is purely visual. However, the observation is clear from the graph: every vertical line intersects the curve at most once.

### Step 6: Compare with answer choices
Based on the vertical line test, the relation is a function.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
