### Analysis of the Problem:
The image shows a **regular octagon** with a given measurement of 6 cm. The measurement of 6 cm is the **apothem** of the octagon, which is the perpendicular distance from the center of the octagon to the midpoint of one of its sides. The goal is to find the area of the regular octagon.

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of a Regular Octagon
A regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal internal angles. The formula for the area \( A \) of a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, side length \( s \), and apothem \( a \) is:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot P \cdot a
\]
where \( P \) is the perimeter of the polygon, and \( a \) is the apothem.

#### Step 2: Relate the Apothem to the Side Length
For a regular octagon, the relationship between the side length \( s \), the apothem \( a \), and the radius \( R \) (distance from the center to a vertex) can be derived using trigonometry. However, we can use the direct relationship involving the apothem and the side length. The formula for the apothem \( a \) in terms of the side length \( s \) is:
\[
a = \frac{s}{2 \tan(\pi/n)}
\]
For an octagon (\( n = 8 \)):
\[
a = \frac{s}{2 \tan(\pi/8)}
\]
Given \( a = 6 \) cm, we can solve for \( s \):
\[
6 = \frac{s}{2 \tan(\pi/8)}
\]
\[
s = 6 \cdot 2 \tan(\pi/8)
\]
Using the value \( \tan(\pi/8) \approx 0.4142 \):
\[
s = 6 \cdot 2 \cdot 0.4142 = 6 \cdot 0.8284 = 4.9704 \text{ cm}
\]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Perimeter
The perimeter \( P \) of the octagon is:
\[
P = 8 \cdot s = 8 \cdot 4.9704 \approx 39.7632 \text{ cm}
\]

#### Step 4: Calculate the Area
Using the area formula \( A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot P \cdot a \):
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 39.7632 \cdot 6
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 238.5792 = 119.2896 \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### Step 5: Round to the Nearest Tenth
Rounding 119.2896 to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
A \approx 119.3 \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The closest value to 119.3 among the given choices is 101.8.
