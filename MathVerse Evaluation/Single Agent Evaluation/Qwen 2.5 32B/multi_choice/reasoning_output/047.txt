### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given a geometric figure with the following key elements:
- Straight line \( AB \) is parallel to straight line \( CD \).
- Angle \( \angle C = 44^\circ \).
- Angle \( \angle E \) is a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
- We need to find the measure of angle \( \angle 1 \).

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
1. \( AB \parallel CD \): This means corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific relationships.
2. \( \angle C = 44^\circ \): This is an exterior angle formed by the transversal \( CE \) intersecting the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( CD \).
3. \( \angle E = 90^\circ \): This is a right angle formed at point \( E \).

#### Step 2: Use Parallel Line Properties
Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the transversal \( CE \) creates several angle relationships:
- The corresponding angle to \( \angle C \) on line \( AB \) is equal to \( \angle C \). However, we need to focus on the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \).

#### Step 3: Determine the Relationship Between Angles
- The angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) (on the same side of the transversal \( AE \)) is the supplement of \( \angle 1 \). Let's call this angle \( \angle 2 \). Therefore, \( \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \).
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the angle formed by the transversal \( CE \) with line \( AB \) at point \( A \) is equal to \( \angle C \) because they are corresponding angles. Thus, the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) (let's call it \( \angle 2 \)) is supplementary to \( \angle 1 \).

#### Step 4: Use the Right Angle at \( E \)
- At point \( E \), we have a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)). This means the sum of the angles around point \( E \) must satisfy the properties of a triangle or linear pair.
- The angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) (let's call it \( \angle 2 \)) can be determined using the fact that \( \angle C = 44^\circ \) and the properties of parallel lines.

#### Step 5: Calculate \( \angle 1 \)
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the angle formed by the transversal \( CE \) with line \( AB \) at point \( A \) is \( 44^\circ \). Therefore, the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) (let's call it \( \angle 2 \)) is \( 180^\circ - 44^\circ = 136^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are supplementary, we have:
  \[
  \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 1 + 136^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 136^\circ = 44^\circ
  \]

However, we need to re-evaluate the relationship involving the right angle at \( E \). The correct approach is to consider the linear pair formed by \( \angle 1 \) and the angle adjacent to it, which is \( 180^\circ - 44^\circ = 136^\circ \).

Thus, the correct value of \( \angle 1 \) is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
