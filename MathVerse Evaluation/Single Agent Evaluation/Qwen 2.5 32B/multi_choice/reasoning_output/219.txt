QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Analyze the Geometric Figure and Given Information
The image shows a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following side lengths:
- \( AB = 2x - 7 \)
- \( BC = 4x - 21 \)
- \( AC = x - 3 \)

We are told that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB \cong BC \). This means that the lengths of sides \( AB \) and \( BC \) are equal.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation for Isosceles Triangle
Since \( AB = BC \), we can write:
\[
2x - 7 = 4x - 21
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
To solve for \( x \), follow these steps:
1. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   -7 = 2x - 21
   \]
2. Add 21 to both sides:
   \[
   14 = 2x
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Length of \( AB \)
Now that we have \( x = 7 \), substitute \( x \) into the expression for \( AB \):
\[
AB = 2x - 7
\]
\[
AB = 2(7) - 7
\]
\[
AB = 14 - 7
\]
\[
AB = 7
\]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
To ensure the solution is correct, we should verify that \( AB = BC \) when \( x = 7 \):
- \( AB = 2x - 7 = 2(7) - 7 = 7 \)
- \( BC = 4x - 21 = 4(7) - 21 = 28 - 21 = 7 \)

Since \( AB = BC = 7 \), the triangle is indeed isosceles, and our value for \( x \) is correct.

### Step 6: Match the Answer with the Choices
The length of \( AB \) is 7. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 3
- B: 4
- C: 7
- D: 11

The correct answer is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
