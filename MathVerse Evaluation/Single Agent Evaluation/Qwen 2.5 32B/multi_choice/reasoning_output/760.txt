### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- The circle has center \( P \) and radius \( r \).
- Lines \( AB \) and \( AC \) are tangent to the circle at points \( B \) and \( C \), respectively.
- \( M \) is the midpoint of segment \( AC \).
- \( \angle PMC = \angle MPC \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
1. **Tangents and Right Angles:**
   - Since \( AB \) and \( AC \) are tangents to the circle at \( B \) and \( C \), we have:
     \[
     PB \perp AB \quad \text{and} \quad PC \perp AC.
     \]
   - This implies \( \angle PBA = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle PCA = 90^\circ \).

2. **Midpoint and Isosceles Triangle:**
   - \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), so \( AM = MC \).
   - Given \( \angle PMC = \angle MPC \), triangle \( PMC \) is isosceles with \( PM = PC \).

3. **Radius and Tangent Properties:**
   - Since \( PC \) is a radius of the circle, \( PC = r \).
   - Therefore, in the isosceles triangle \( PMC \), \( PM = PC = r \).

#### **Step 3: Use the Right Triangle \( APC \)**
- In triangle \( APC \):
  - \( PC = r \) (radius of the circle).
  - \( AC \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( APC \) because \( \angle PCA = 90^\circ \).
  - Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), \( AM = MC \).

#### **Step 4: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem in \( \triangle APC \)**
- Let \( AC = 2x \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint, \( AM = MC = x \).
- In \( \triangle PMC \):
  - \( PM = r \) (as established).
  - \( MC = x \).
  - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle PMC \):
    \[
    PM^2 + MC^2 = PC^2.
    \]
    Substituting the known values:
    \[
    r^2 + x^2 = r^2.
    \]
    This confirms the consistency of the setup.

#### **Step 5: Find the Length of \( PA \)**
- In \( \triangle APC \):
  - \( AC = 2x \).
  - \( PC = r \).
  - Since \( \angle PCA = 90^\circ \), apply the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle APC \):
    \[
    AP^2 = AC^2 + PC^2.
    \]
    Substitute \( AC = 2r \) (since \( M \) is the midpoint and \( PM = r \)):
    \[
    AP^2 = (2r)^2 + r^2 = 4r^2 + r^2 = 5r^2.
    \]
    Therefore:
    \[
    AP = \sqrt{5r^2} = r\sqrt{5}.
    \]

#### **Step 6: Match the Answer with the Choices**
The length of segment \( PA \) is \( r\sqrt{5} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{E}
\]
