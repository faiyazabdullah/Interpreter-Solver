### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We are given a sector of a circle with a radius of 24 cm, which is used to form a conical hat. The radius of the base of the conical hat is 10 cm. We need to find the area of the sector cardboard used to make the conical hat.

#### **Step 2: Identify Key Relationships**
- The radius of the sector (which becomes the slant height of the cone) is 24 cm.
- The radius of the base of the cone is 10 cm.
- When the sector is formed into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Circumference of the Base of the Cone**
The circumference of the base of the cone is given by:
\[
\text{Circumference} = 2\pi \times \text{radius} = 2\pi \times 10 = 20\pi \text{ cm}
\]
This circumference corresponds to the arc length of the sector.

#### **Step 4: Relate the Arc Length to the Sector**
The arc length of a sector with radius \( r \) and central angle \( \theta \) (in radians) is given by:
\[
\text{Arc length} = r\theta
\]
Here, the radius \( r \) of the sector is 24 cm, and the arc length is \( 20\pi \) cm. Therefore:
\[
24\theta = 20\pi
\]
Solving for \( \theta \):
\[
\theta = \frac{20\pi}{24} = \frac{5\pi}{6} \text{ radians}
\]

#### **Step 5: Calculate the Area of the Sector**
The area \( A \) of a sector with radius \( r \) and central angle \( \theta \) (in radians) is given by:
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
\]
Substituting \( r = 24 \) cm and \( \theta = \frac{5\pi}{6} \):
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 24^2 \times \frac{5\pi}{6}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 576 \times \frac{5\pi}{6}
\]
\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 576 \times \frac{5\pi}{6} = \frac{576 \times 5\pi}{12} = \frac{2880\pi}{12} = 240\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 6: Compare with the Answer Choices**
The area of the sector cardboard is \( 240\pi \text{ cm}^2 \). This matches option A.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
