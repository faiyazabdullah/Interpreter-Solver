To solve the problem, we need to use the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles in a circle. Let's go through the solution step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( P \) are on the circle.
- The center of the circle is \( O \).
- The central angle \( \angle AOB = 40^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle APB \).

### Step 2: Recall the relevant geometric property
The key property we will use is:
- An inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc as a central angle is half the measure of the central angle.

In other words:
\[ \text{Measure of inscribed angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of central angle} \]

### Step 3: Apply the property
Here, the central angle \( \angle AOB \) intercepts the arc \( AB \). The inscribed angle \( \angle APB \) also intercepts the same arc \( AB \). Therefore:
\[ \angle APB = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle AOB \]

### Step 4: Substitute the given value
We are given that \( \angle AOB = 40^\circ \). Substituting this value into the formula:
\[ \angle APB = \frac{1}{2} \times 40^\circ = 20^\circ \]

### Step 5: Verify the result
The measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle APB \) is indeed half the measure of the central angle \( \angle AOB \). This matches our calculation.

### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( \angle APB \) is \( 20^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \( 80^\circ \)
- B: \( 140^\circ \)
- C: \( 20^\circ \)
- D: \( 50^\circ \)

The correct answer is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
