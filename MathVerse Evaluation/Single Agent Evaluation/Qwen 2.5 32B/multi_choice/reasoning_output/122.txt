### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a sector of a circle being used to form the lateral surface of a cone. We are tasked with finding the height of the cone.

#### Step 1: Identify Given Information
- Central angle of the sector: \(120^\circ\)
- Radius of the sector: \(6\) (which becomes the slant height of the cone)

#### Step 2: Determine the Arc Length of the Sector
The arc length of the sector will become the circumference of the base of the cone. The formula for the arc length \(L\) of a sector is:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi r
\]
where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius of the sector.

Substitute the given values:
\[
L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi \cdot 6 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 12\pi = 4\pi
\]

So, the circumference of the base of the cone is \(4\pi\).

#### Step 3: Find the Radius of the Base of the Cone
Let \(r\) be the radius of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base is given by:
\[
2\pi r = 4\pi
\]
Solving for \(r\):
\[
r = \frac{4\pi}{2\pi} = 2
\]

#### Step 4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to Find the Height of the Cone
The slant height of the cone is the radius of the sector, which is \(6\). Let \(h\) be the height of the cone. The relationship between the radius of the base, the height, and the slant height of the cone is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{(slant height)}^2 = \text{(radius of base)}^2 + \text{(height)}^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
6^2 = 2^2 + h^2
\]
\[
36 = 4 + h^2
\]
Solving for \(h\):
\[
h^2 = 36 - 4 = 32
\]
\[
h = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 5: Select the Correct Answer
The height of the cone is \(4\sqrt{2}\), which corresponds to choice D.

### Final Answer:
