### Analysis of the Problem:
The given image shows a right triangle with one of its acute angles labeled as \( \angle 4 \). An external angle adjacent to \( \angle 4 \) is given as \( 123^\circ \). We need to find the measure of \( \angle 4 \).

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The triangle is a right triangle, so one of its angles is \( 90^\circ \).
- One of the acute angles is labeled as \( \angle 4 \).
- An external angle adjacent to \( \angle 4 \) is given as \( 123^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Use the property of external angles
An external angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles. In this case:
- The external angle \( 123^\circ \) is formed by extending one side of the triangle.
- This external angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles of the triangle.

However, since the triangle is a right triangle, we can use a simpler relationship involving the external angle and the adjacent internal angle. Specifically:
\[ \text{External angle} = 180^\circ - \text{adjacent internal angle} \]

Here, the external angle is \( 123^\circ \), and it is adjacent to \( \angle 4 \). Therefore:
\[ 123^\circ = 180^\circ - \angle 4 \]

#### Step 3: Solve for \( \angle 4 \)
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( \angle 4 \):
\[ \angle 4 = 180^\circ - 123^\circ \]
\[ \angle 4 = 57^\circ \]

#### Step 4: Verify the solution
- The measure of \( \angle 4 \) is \( 57^\circ \).
- Since the triangle is a right triangle, the sum of the two acute angles must be \( 90^\circ \). The other acute angle would be:
\[ 90^\circ - 57^\circ = 33^\circ \]
This confirms that the angles are consistent with the properties of a right triangle.

#### Step 5: Match the solution with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( \angle 4 \) is \( 57^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 33
- B: 43
- C: 57
- D: 123

The correct answer is \( 57 \).

### Final Answer:
