### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- **AB** is the diameter of circle \(O\).
- Points \(C\) and \(D\) lie on the circle.
- \(\angle BOD = 130^\circ\).

We need to find the measure of \(\angle ACD\).

#### **Step 2: Key geometric properties**
1. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Relationship**: 
   - A central angle subtends an arc equal to twice the measure of any inscribed angle that subtends the same arc.
   - For example, if \(\angle BOD\) is a central angle, then the inscribed angle \(\angle BAD\) (subtending the same arc \(BD\)) is half of \(\angle BOD\).

2. **Diameter and Right Angles**:
   - Since \(AB\) is the diameter of the circle, any angle subtended by the diameter at the circumference is a right angle (\(90^\circ\)). This means \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\).

#### **Step 3: Calculate \(\angle BAD\)** 
- \(\angle BOD\) is a central angle, and \(\angle BAD\) is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc \(BD\).
- By the central angle-inscribed angle relationship:
  \[
  \angle BAD = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle BOD = \frac{1}{2} \times 130^\circ = 65^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 4: Use the property of the diameter**
- Since \(AB\) is the diameter, \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\).
- In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\), and \(\angle BAD = 65^\circ\). We need to find \(\angle ACD\).

#### **Step 5: Analyze \(\angle ACD\)** 
- Note that \(\angle ACD\) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc \(AD\).
- The measure of \(\angle ACD\) can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles in \(\triangle ACD\) must be \(180^\circ\), but we can also use the inscribed angle property directly.

#### **Step 6: Relate \(\angle ACD\) to the central angle**
- The arc \(AD\) is part of the circle, and \(\angle ACD\) is an inscribed angle subtending this arc.
- The central angle corresponding to arc \(AD\) is \(360^\circ - \angle BOD = 360^\circ - 130^\circ = 230^\circ\).
- However, since \(\angle ACD\) is an inscribed angle, it is half the measure of the arc it subtends. But we can use the fact that \(\angle ACD\) is part of the cyclic quadrilateral properties and the right angle at \(C\).

#### **Step 7: Simplify using the right angle at \(C\)** 
- Since \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\), and \(\angle BAD = 65^\circ\), the remaining angle \(\angle ACD\) in the cyclic quadrilateral can be found as:
  \[
  \angle ACD = 90^\circ - \angle BAD = 90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 8: Verify the answer**
- The measure of \(\angle ACD\) is indeed \(25^\circ\), as it satisfies all the geometric properties and relationships in the circle.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
