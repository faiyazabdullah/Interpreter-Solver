### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The triangle is a right triangle.
- One angle is \(30^\circ\) and another is \(60^\circ\), which means the third angle is \(90^\circ\) (since the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\)).
- The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is \(21\).
- The hypotenuse is denoted as \(x\).
- The other side (opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle) is denoted as \(y\).

#### **Step 2: Use properties of a 30-60-90 triangle**
In a 30-60-90 triangle:
- The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is half the length of the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.

Let's denote:
- The side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle as \(a = 21\).
- The hypotenuse as \(x\).
- The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle as \(y\).

From the properties:
1. The hypotenuse \(x\) is twice the length of the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle:
   \[
   x = 2 \cdot a = 2 \cdot 21 = 42
   \]

2. The side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle \(y\) is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle:
   \[
   y = a \cdot \sqrt{3} = 21 \cdot \sqrt{3}
   \]

#### **Step 3: Verify the results**
- The hypotenuse \(x = 42\) is consistent with the property that it is twice the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.
- The side \(y = 21\sqrt{3}\) is consistent with the property that it is \(\sqrt{3}\) times the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.

#### **Step 4: Match the result with the answer choices**
The value of \(y\) is \(21\sqrt{3}\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \(21\)
- B: \(21\sqrt{2}\)
- C: \(21\sqrt{3}\)
- D: \(42\)

The correct choice is \(C\).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
