====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the solution steps:

### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The figure shows a circle with center \( O \).
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- The central angle \( \angle BOC \) is given as \( 100^\circ \).

### Step 2: Understand the relationship between central and inscribed angles
- The central angle \( \angle BOC \) subtends the arc \( BC \).
- The inscribed angle \( \angle BAC \) also subtends the same arc \( BC \).
- According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
  \[
  \text{Measure of inscribed angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of central angle}
  \]

### Step 3: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem
- Here, the central angle \( \angle BOC = 100^\circ \).
- Therefore, the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle BAC \) is:
  \[
  \angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \times 100^\circ = 50^\circ
  \]

### Step 4: Verify the result
- The Inscribed Angle Theorem guarantees that the measure of the inscribed angle is always half the measure of the corresponding central angle. This confirms our calculation.

### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
- The calculated value of \( \angle BAC \) is \( 50^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  A: \( 50^\circ \)
  B: \( 80^\circ \)
  C: \( 100^\circ \)
  D: \( 130^\circ \)

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
