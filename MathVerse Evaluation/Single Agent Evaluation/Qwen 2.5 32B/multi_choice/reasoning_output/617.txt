QUESTION:
The graph, which is a piecewise function and passes through the origin, shows Frank's speed while he is competing in a walking race, the x-axis representing Time and the y-axis representing Speed. Which situation corresponds to the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Frank starts off at a constant speed and then increases his speed at a steady rate
B:Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed
C:Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually, then increases his pace at a faster rate as he sees his arch rival beside him and finally increases his pace at a more gradual pace
D:Frank increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race

To solve this problem, let's analyze the graph step by step:

### Step 1: Examine the Graph
- The graph represents **Speed** (y-axis) versus **Time** (x-axis).
- The graph starts at the origin, meaning Frank's initial speed is 0.
- Initially, the graph shows a curve that rises gradually, indicating that Frank's speed increases over time but does so at a decreasing rate.
- After some time, the graph becomes a straight horizontal line, indicating that Frank reaches a constant speed and maintains it.

### Step 2: Interpret the Graph
- **Initial Phase**: The curve starting from the origin suggests that Frank begins with zero speed and gradually increases his speed. This implies he is accelerating.
- **Middle Phase**: The curve flattens out as it approaches a constant value. This indicates that Frank's acceleration decreases over time until it reaches zero.
- **Final Phase**: Once the graph becomes a horizontal line, Frank's speed is no longer changing, meaning he has reached a constant speed and is maintaining it.

### Step 3: Match the Graph to the Situations
Let's evaluate each option based on the graph:

#### Option A: Frank starts off at a constant speed and then increases his speed at a steady rate
- This option suggests that Frank starts with a constant speed (not zero) and then accelerates steadily. However, the graph shows that Frank starts at zero speed and accelerates gradually, not at a constant speed initially. Therefore, this option does not match the graph.

#### Option B: Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed
- This option aligns perfectly with the graph. Frank starts at zero speed, increases his speed gradually (as indicated by the curved portion of the graph), and eventually reaches a constant speed (as indicated by the horizontal line). This matches the observed behavior in the graph.

#### Option C: Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually, then increases his pace at a faster rate as he sees his arch rival beside him, and finally increases his pace at a more gradual pace
- This option describes a more complex scenario where Frank's acceleration changes multiple times. However, the graph only shows a single phase of gradual acceleration followed by a constant speed. There is no indication in the graph that Frank accelerates at different rates at different times. Therefore, this option does not match the graph.

#### Option D: Frank increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race
- This option suggests that Frank accelerates at a constant rate, which would be represented by a straight diagonal line on the graph. However, the graph shows a curved line initially, indicating that the rate of acceleration is not constant. Therefore, this option does not match the graph.

### Step 4: Conclusion
The graph best matches the description in **Option B**, where Frank starts by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed.

Final Answer: B
