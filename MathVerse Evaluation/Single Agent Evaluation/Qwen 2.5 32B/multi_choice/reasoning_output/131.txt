### Analysis and Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the problem and given information
- We are given a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle C = 90^\circ \).
- Point \( D \) is a moving point on \( BC \) (excluding \( C \)).
- A circle is constructed with \( CD \) as its diameter, and this circle intersects \( AD \) at point \( P \).
- It is given that \( AC = 6 \) and the minimum length of \( BP \) is 2.
- We need to find the length of \( AB \).

#### Step 2: Key geometric properties
1. **Circle with diameter \( CD \)**:
   - Since \( CD \) is the diameter of the circle, \( \angle CPD = 90^\circ \) (by the property of a circle where an angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle).
   - Therefore, \( \triangle CPD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle CPD = 90^\circ \).

2. **Right triangle \( \triangle ABC \)**:
   - \( \angle C = 90^\circ \), so \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.
   - Let \( BC = x \) and \( AB = c \). By the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \implies c^2 = 6^2 + x^2 \implies c^2 = 36 + x^2.
     \]

3. **Point \( P \) on \( AD \)**:
   - Since \( P \) lies on the circle with diameter \( CD \), \( \angle CPD = 90^\circ \).
   - This implies that \( P \) is the foot of the perpendicular from \( D \) to \( AD \).

4. **Minimum length of \( BP \)**:
   - The problem states that the minimum length of \( BP \) is 2. This occurs when \( D \) is such that \( BP \) is minimized.

#### Step 3: Use the minimum condition for \( BP \)
- When \( D \) is positioned such that \( BP \) is minimized, \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). This is because the circle's radius is minimized when \( D \) is closest to \( C \), and the perpendicular distance from \( B \) to \( AD \) is minimized.

#### Step 4: Coordinates and geometry
- Place \( C \) at the origin \((0, 0)\), \( A \) at \((6, 0)\), and \( B \) at \((0, y)\).
- The equation of line \( AD \) can be derived using the coordinates of \( A \) and \( D \):
  - Let \( D \) be \((0, d)\) where \( 0 < d < y \).
  - The slope of \( AD \) is:
    \[
    \text{slope of } AD = \frac{d - 0}{0 - 6} = -\frac{d}{6}.
    \]
  - The equation of line \( AD \) is:
    \[
    y = -\frac{d}{6}x + d.
    \]

#### Step 5: Minimize \( BP \)
- The minimum length of \( BP \) is given as 2. This occurs when \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), i.e., \( D = \left(0, \frac{y}{2}\right) \).
- In this case, the circle's diameter is \( CD = \frac{y}{2} \), and the radius is \( \frac{y}{4} \).
- The length \( BP \) is minimized when \( P \) is the projection of \( B \) onto \( AD \).

#### Step 6: Use the Pythagorean theorem
- From the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \):
  \[
  AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \implies c^2 = 36 + x^2.
  \]
- Since the minimum \( BP = 2 \), we can use the geometric configuration to find \( AB \):
  - When \( D \) is the midpoint, the configuration simplifies, and we can use the relationship between the sides of the right triangle and the circle's properties.
  - Solving for \( AB \) using the given conditions, we find:
    \[
    AB = 2\sqrt{13}.
    \]

#### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
