### Analysis of the Problem:
We are tasked with finding the area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\). Let's break down the problem step by step.

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram.
- \(BD\) is perpendicular to both \(AB\) and \(DC\).
- \(BD = 6 \, \text{m}\).
- \(AD = 10 \, \text{m}\).

Since \(BD\) is perpendicular to both \(AB\) and \(DC\), it serves as the height of the parallelogram when either \(AB\) or \(DC\) is considered the base. This is because the height of a parallelogram is the perpendicular distance between the base and the opposite side.

#### Step 2: Identify the base and height
In a parallelogram, the area can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, we can choose either \(AB\) or \(DC\) as the base, and \(BD\) as the height. Since \(AB\) and \(DC\) are parallel and equal in length (properties of a parallelogram), we can use \(AD\) as the base for simplicity, with \(BD\) as the height.

#### Step 3: Calculate the area
The base \(AD\) is given as \(10 \, \text{m}\), and the height \(BD\) is given as \(6 \, \text{m}\). Therefore, the area of the parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Area} = AD \times BD = 10 \, \text{m} \times 6 \, \text{m} = 60 \, \text{m}^2
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the result
The calculation is straightforward and follows directly from the definition of the area of a parallelogram. There are no additional constraints or ambiguities in the problem that would alter this result.

#### Final Answer:
The area of the parallelogram \(ABCD\) is \(60 \, \text{m}^2\).
