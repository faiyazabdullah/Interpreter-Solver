QUESTION:
In the figure shown above, the rectangular container has length, width and height of 6, 5, and 4, and the cylinder has radius of 3. If all the water in the rectangular container is poured into the cylinder, the water level rises from $h$ inches to $(h+x)$ inches. Which of the following is the best approximation of the value of $x$ ?

CHOICES:
A:3
B:3.4
C:3.8
D:4.2

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- **Rectangular container dimensions**: Length = 6 inches, Width = 5 inches, Height = 4 inches.
- **Volume of the rectangular container**: 
  \[
  V_{\text{rect}} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 5 \times 4 = 120 \text{ cubic inches}.
  \]
- **Cylinder dimensions**: Radius = 3 inches, initial water height = \( h \) inches, new water height = \( h + x \) inches.
- **Volume of the cylinder**: 
  \[
  V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h,
  \]
  where \( r = 3 \) inches.

#### **Step 2: Volume of water in the rectangular container**
The volume of water in the rectangular container is the same as its total volume since it is fully filled:
\[
V_{\text{water}} = 120 \text{ cubic inches}.
\]

#### **Step 3: Volume of water in the cylinder**
When the water is poured into the cylinder, the volume of water remains the same (120 cubic inches). The water initially fills the cylinder up to a height of \( h \) inches, and after pouring, the water level rises to \( h + x \) inches. The increase in volume due to the added water is:
\[
V_{\text{added}} = \pi r^2 x,
\]
where \( r = 3 \) inches and \( x \) is the increase in height.

#### **Step 4: Relate the volumes**
The volume of water added to the cylinder is equal to the volume of the rectangular container:
\[
\pi r^2 x = 120.
\]
Substitute \( r = 3 \):
\[
\pi (3)^2 x = 120 \implies 9\pi x = 120.
\]

#### **Step 5: Solve for \( x \)**
Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):
\[
9 \times 3.14 \cdot x = 120 \implies 28.26x = 120.
\]
Solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{120}{28.26} \approx 4.24.
\]

#### **Step 6: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated value of \( x \) is approximately 4.24. The closest answer choice is:
\[
\text{D: 4.2}.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
