### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a right circular cone where:
- \( AO \) is the height of the cone.
- \( OB \) is the radius of the base, given as \( 0.7 \).
- \( AB \) is the slant height of the cone, given as \( 2.5 \).

We are tasked with finding the length of \( AO \), the height of the cone.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Geometric Configuration:**
   - The triangle \( AOB \) is a right triangle, where:
     - \( AO \) is one leg (height of the cone).
     - \( OB \) is another leg (radius of the base, \( 0.7 \)).
     - \( AB \) is the hypotenuse (slant height of the cone, \( 2.5 \)).

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   In a right triangle, the relationship between the sides is given by:
   \[
   AB^2 = AO^2 + OB^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   2.5^2 = AO^2 + 0.7^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the Squares:**
   - \( 2.5^2 = 6.25 \)
   - \( 0.7^2 = 0.49 \)

   Substitute these into the equation:
   \[
   6.25 = AO^2 + 0.49
   \]

4. **Isolate \( AO^2 \):**
   \[
   AO^2 = 6.25 - 0.49
   \]
   \[
   AO^2 = 5.76
   \]

5. **Solve for \( AO \):**
   Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   AO = \sqrt{5.76}
   \]
   \[
   AO = 2.4
   \]

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   The calculated value of \( AO \) is \( 2.4 \). This matches option A.
