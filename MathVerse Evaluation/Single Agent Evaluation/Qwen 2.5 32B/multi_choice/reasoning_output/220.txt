### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- \( \odot G \) is a circle with center \( G \).
- \( CE \) and \( AB \) are diameters of the circle.
- \( \angle AGD \) is a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
- \( \angle AGC = 60^\circ \).

#### **Step 2: Analyze the geometric relationships**
1. Since \( CE \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they pass through the center \( G \) and are perpendicular to each other because they are diameters of a circle.
2. \( \angle AGD = 90^\circ \) implies that \( AD \) is perpendicular to \( GB \).
3. \( \angle AGC = 60^\circ \) is given.

#### **Step 3: Determine \( \angle BGE \)**
1. Since \( CE \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they divide the circle into four quadrants. The total angle around the center \( G \) is \( 360^\circ \).
2. \( \angle AGC = 60^\circ \). Since \( AB \) is a diameter, \( \angle AGC \) is part of the semicircle \( ACB \).
3. Because \( \angle AGD = 90^\circ \), \( D \) lies on the circle such that \( GD \) is perpendicular to \( AB \). This means \( \angle BGD = 90^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Use the fact that \( CE \) and \( AB \) are perpendicular**
- Since \( CE \) and \( AB \) are diameters, they are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, \( \angle BGE = 180^\circ - \angle AGC \) (because \( \angle BGE \) is the supplementary angle to \( \angle AGC \) in the context of the circle's symmetry).

#### **Step 5: Calculate \( \angle BGE \)**
- \( \angle AGC = 60^\circ \).
- Since \( CE \) and \( AB \) are perpendicular, the angle between them is \( 90^\circ \). However, we need to consider the full circle's symmetry.
- The angle \( \angle BGE \) is the angle subtended by the arc \( BE \) and is supplementary to \( \angle AGC \) in the context of the circle's geometry.
- Therefore, \( \angle BGE = 360^\circ - 2 \times 60^\circ = 240^\circ \).

#### **Step 6: Verify the answer**
- The angle \( \angle BGE \) is indeed \( 240^\circ \) because it is the reflex angle formed by the diameters \( CE \) and \( AB \) in the context of the circle.
