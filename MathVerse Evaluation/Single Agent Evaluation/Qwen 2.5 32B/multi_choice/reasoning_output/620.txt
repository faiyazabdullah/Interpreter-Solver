QUESTION:
This graph shows the relationship between the current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms) in an electrical circuit, when the voltage provided to the circuit is 240 V. The equation could be described as \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}}=\text{Current}

What happens to the current as the resistance increases?

CHOICES:
A:The current increases.
B:The current decreases.

### Problem Analysis:
The image provided is a graph showing the relationship between current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms) in an electrical circuit. The equation governing this relationship is given as:

\[
\text{Current} = \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}}
\]

This equation indicates that the current is inversely proportional to the resistance. In other words, as the resistance increases, the current decreases, and vice versa.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Understanding the Equation**:
   - The equation \(\text{Current} = \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}}\) tells us that the current is determined by dividing the constant voltage (240 volts) by the resistance.
   - As the resistance increases, the denominator of the fraction increases, which causes the value of the current to decrease.

2. **Graphical Interpretation**:
   - The graph shows a hyperbolic curve, which is characteristic of an inverse relationship.
   - As the resistance (x-axis) increases from left to right, the current (y-axis) decreases. This is visually confirmed by the downward trend of the curve.

3. **Logical Deduction**:
   - From the equation, it is clear that increasing the resistance will result in a smaller value for the current because the numerator (240) remains constant while the denominator (resistance) grows larger.
   - This confirms the inverse relationship between current and resistance.

4. **Answering the Question**:
   - The question asks what happens to the current as the resistance increases.
   - Based on the equation and the graph, we can conclude that the current decreases as the resistance increases.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
