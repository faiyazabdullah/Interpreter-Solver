To solve the problem, let's analyze the given information and apply geometric principles step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- The lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel (\(a \parallel b\)).
- A right-angled triangle is placed such that its right angle vertex lies on the line \(a\).
- Angle 1 is given as \(42^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of angle 2.

### Step 2: Label and Analyze the Figure
- Let the right angle of the triangle be at point \(A\). This means \(\angle CAB = 90^\circ\).
- Angle 1 is formed between the side of the triangle and the line \(a\). Therefore, \(\angle 1 = 42^\circ\).
- Since \(a \parallel b\), the transversal (the side of the triangle extending from \(A\)) creates corresponding angles and alternate interior angles with the parallel lines.

### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties
1. **Identify Corresponding Angles:**
   - Since \(a \parallel b\), the angle formed by the transversal with line \(b\) directly below angle 1 will be equal to angle 1 due to the property of corresponding angles.
   - Therefore, the angle directly below angle 1 on line \(b\) is also \(42^\circ\).

2. **Analyze the Right Triangle:**
   - In the right triangle, the sum of the angles around point \(A\) must satisfy the properties of a triangle.
   - The right angle at \(A\) is \(90^\circ\).
   - The angle adjacent to angle 1 in the triangle is \(90^\circ - 42^\circ = 48^\circ\).

3. **Use Alternate Interior Angles:**
   - The angle \(2\) is an alternate interior angle to the angle we just calculated (which is \(48^\circ\)). This is because the transversal intersects the parallel lines \(a\) and \(b\).
   - Therefore, angle 2 is equal to \(48^\circ\).

### Step 4: Conclusion
- Based on the above reasoning, the measure of angle 2 is \(48^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
