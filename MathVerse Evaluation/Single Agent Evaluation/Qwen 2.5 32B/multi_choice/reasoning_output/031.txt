### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given a geometric figure with the following details:
- Line \( a \) is parallel to line \( b \).
- Point \( B \) lies on line \( b \).
- \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( BC \), meaning \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- \( \angle 2 = 65^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Relationships**
Since line \( a \) is parallel to line \( b \), and \( \angle 2 \) is formed between line \( a \) and a transversal passing through point \( C \), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals.

#### **Step 2: Identify Corresponding Angles**
Because \( a \parallel b \), the angle formed by the transversal at point \( C \) (which is \( \angle 2 \)) corresponds to an angle on line \( b \) at point \( B \). Specifically, the angle corresponding to \( \angle 2 \) on line \( b \) is the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) at point \( B \).

Let's denote the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) as \( \angle 3 \). Since \( a \parallel b \), we have:
\[ \angle 3 = \angle 2 = 65^\circ. \]

#### **Step 3: Use the Perpendicular Condition**
We are given that \( AB \perp BC \), so:
\[ \angle ABC = 90^\circ. \]

#### **Step 4: Determine \( \angle 1 \)**
In triangle \( ABC \), the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \). The angles in triangle \( ABC \) are:
- \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \),
- \( \angle 3 = 65^\circ \),
- \( \angle 1 \).

Using the angle sum property of a triangle:
\[ \angle 1 + \angle 3 + \angle ABC = 180^\circ. \]
Substitute the known values:
\[ \angle 1 + 65^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ. \]
Simplify:
\[ \angle 1 + 155^\circ = 180^\circ. \]
Solve for \( \angle 1 \):
\[ \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 155^\circ = 25^\circ. \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 25^\circ \).

Final Answer: B
