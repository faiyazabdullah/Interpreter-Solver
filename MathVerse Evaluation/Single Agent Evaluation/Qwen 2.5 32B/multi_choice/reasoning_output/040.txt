### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where two parallel lines \( a \) and \( b \) are intersected by a transversal line \( c \). The problem specifies that:
- Line \( a \parallel b \).
- Angle 1 is given as \( 50^\circ \).

We need to find the measure of angle 2.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( a \parallel b \): Lines \( a \) and \( b \) are parallel.
   - \( \angle 1 = 50^\circ \): The angle formed by the transversal \( c \) with line \( a \) is \( 50^\circ \).

#### 2. **Understand the relationship between angles:**
   - Since \( a \parallel b \), the transversal \( c \) creates corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and supplementary angles.
   - Specifically, \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are **consecutive interior angles** (also known as same-side interior angles) because they lie on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines.

#### 3. **Use the property of consecutive interior angles:**
   - Consecutive interior angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines are supplementary. This means their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).
   - Mathematically: 
     \[
     \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
     \]

#### 4. **Substitute the given value of \( \angle 1 \):**
   - We know \( \angle 1 = 50^\circ \). Substituting this into the equation:
     \[
     50^\circ + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
     \]

#### 5. **Solve for \( \angle 2 \):**
   - Subtract \( 50^\circ \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
     \]

#### 6. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 130^\circ \).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: \( 50^\circ \)
     - B: \( 130^\circ \)
     - C: \( 40^\circ \)
     - D: \( 60^\circ \)

#### 7. **Select the correct answer:**
   - The correct answer is \( 130^\circ \), which corresponds to choice B.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
