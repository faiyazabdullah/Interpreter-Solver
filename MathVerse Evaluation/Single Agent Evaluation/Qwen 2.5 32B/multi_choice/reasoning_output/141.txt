### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves using similar triangles to find the height of a building. Here's a breakdown of the given information and the steps to solve it:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The shadow length of the building \( AB \) is 15 meters.
- The height of the benchmark (a smaller object) is 2 meters.
- The shadow length of the benchmark \( AC \) is 3 meters.
- We need to find the height of the building.

#### Step 2: Understand the geometric relationship
The problem involves similar triangles. When the sun's rays are considered parallel, the triangles formed by the building and its shadow, and the benchmark and its shadow, are similar. This means the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal.

#### Step 3: Define the triangles
- Let the height of the building be \( h \).
- The triangle formed by the building and its shadow is \( \triangle BDE \), where \( DE = h \) (the height of the building).
- The triangle formed by the benchmark and its shadow is \( \triangle ACF \), where \( CF = 2 \) meters (the height of the benchmark).

Since the sun's rays are parallel, \( \triangle BDE \) and \( \triangle ACF \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. Therefore, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of the building}}{\text{Height of the benchmark}} = \frac{\text{Shadow length of the building}}{\text{Shadow length of the benchmark}}
\]
This can be written as:
\[
\frac{h}{2} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for \( h \)
Simplify the ratio on the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{15}{3} = 5
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{h}{2} = 5
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( h \):
\[
h = 5 \times 2 = 10
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the result
The height of the building is 10 meters. This satisfies the similarity condition, as the ratio of the heights is equal to the ratio of the shadow lengths:
\[
\frac{10}{2} = 5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{15}{3} = 5
\]

#### Step 6: Select the correct answer
The height of the building is 10 meters, which corresponds to choice A.

### Final Answer:
