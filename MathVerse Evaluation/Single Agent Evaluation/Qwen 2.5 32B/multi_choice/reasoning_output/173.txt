### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle BAD \) in the given geometric figure. The key elements provided are:
- \( AB \) and \( AD \) are chords of circle \( O \).
- \( \angle BOD = 50^\circ \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- \( \angle BOD \) is a central angle subtended by the arc \( BD \).
- The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends. Therefore, the measure of arc \( BD \) is also \( 50^\circ \).

#### Step 2: Relate the central angle to the inscribed angle
- An inscribed angle (such as \( \angle BAD \)) that subtends the same arc as a central angle is half the measure of the central angle.
- Here, \( \angle BAD \) is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc \( BD \) as the central angle \( \angle BOD \).

#### Step 3: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem
The Inscribed Angle Theorem states:
\[ \text{Measure of an inscribed angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of the central angle subtending the same arc} \]

Applying this theorem:
\[ \angle BAD = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle BOD \]
\[ \angle BAD = \frac{1}{2} \times 50^\circ \]
\[ \angle BAD = 25^\circ \]

#### Step 4: Verify the result
- The central angle \( \angle BOD \) is \( 50^\circ \), and the inscribed angle \( \angle BAD \) subtending the same arc \( BD \) is indeed half of \( 50^\circ \), which is \( 25^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle BAD \) is \( 25^\circ \).

Final Answer: C
