QUESTION:
Consider the graph, where it is an exponential function and passes through (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), and (3,8), shown.

Which of the following relationships could be represented by the given graph?

CHOICES:
A:The number of people $(y)$ attending a parent/teacher conference when there are $x$ parents, each bringing 2 children.
B:The number of layers $(y)$ resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half $x$ times.
C:The number of handshakes $(y)$ made by $x$ people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.

### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Graph and Given Information
The graph depicts an exponential function passing through the points:
- \( (0, 1) \)
- \( (1, 2) \)
- \( (2, 4) \)
- \( (3, 8) \)

From these points, we can infer the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \):
- When \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \).
- When \( x = 1 \), \( y = 2 \).
- When \( x = 2 \), \( y = 4 \).
- When \( x = 3 \), \( y = 8 \).

This pattern suggests that \( y \) doubles for each increment in \( x \). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ y = 2^x \]

#### Step 2: Understand the Relationships in Each Option
We need to determine which real-world scenario matches the exponential relationship \( y = 2^x \).

##### Option A: Number of people attending a parent/teacher conference
- Each parent brings 2 children. If there are \( x \) parents, the total number of attendees is:
  \[ y = x + 2x = 3x \]
- This is a linear relationship (\( y = 3x \)), not an exponential one. Therefore, Option A does not match the graph.

##### Option B: Number of layers resulting from folding a piece of paper
- Folding a piece of paper in half once doubles the number of layers. Folding it again doubles the layers again, and so on.
- If the paper is folded \( x \) times, the number of layers \( y \) is:
  \[ y = 2^x \]
- This matches the exponential relationship observed in the graph. Therefore, Option B is a potential match.

##### Option C: Number of handshakes among \( x \) people
- If every person shakes hands with every other person, the total number of handshakes \( y \) is given by the combination formula:
  \[ y = \binom{x}{2} = \frac{x(x-1)}{2} \]
- This is a quadratic relationship (\( y = \frac{x(x-1)}{2} \)), not an exponential one. Therefore, Option C does not match the graph.

#### Step 3: Compare with the Given Answer Choices
- Option A: Linear relationship (\( y = 3x \)).
- Option B: Exponential relationship (\( y = 2^x \)).
- Option C: Quadratic relationship (\( y = \frac{x(x-1)}{2} \)).

The only option that matches the exponential relationship \( y = 2^x \) is **Option B**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
