### Analysis of the Problem:
The image shows three lines \( l \), \( m \), and \( p \). Lines \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel, and line \( p \) is a transversal that intersects both \( l \) and \( m \). The angles formed are labeled as follows:
- \( \angle 4 \) and \( \angle 5 \) are consecutive interior angles (also known as same-side interior angles) because they are on the same side of the transversal \( p \) and between the parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \).

#### Key Geometric Property:
When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the sum of the measures of consecutive interior angles is \( 180^\circ \). That is:
\[
m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
\]

#### Given Information:
- \( m\angle 5 = 7x - 5 \)
- \( m\angle 4 = 2x + 23 \)

#### Goal:
We need to find the value of \( x \) using the relationship \( m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ \).

---

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Set up the equation using the property of consecutive interior angles:**
   \[
   m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 180^\circ
   \]
   Substitute the given expressions for \( m\angle 4 \) and \( m\angle 5 \):
   \[
   (2x + 23) + (7x - 5) = 180
   \]

2. **Combine like terms:**
   \[
   2x + 7x + 23 - 5 = 180
   \]
   \[
   9x + 18 = 180
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Subtract 18 from both sides:
   \[
   9x = 162
   \]
   Divide by 9:
   \[
   x = 18
   \]

---

### Verification:
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 18 \) back into the expressions for \( m\angle 4 \) and \( m\angle 5 \):
- \( m\angle 4 = 2x + 23 = 2(18) + 23 = 36 + 23 = 59 \)
- \( m\angle 5 = 7x - 5 = 7(18) - 5 = 126 - 5 = 121 \)

Check the sum:
\[
m\angle 4 + m\angle 5 = 59 + 121 = 180
\]
The sum is indeed \( 180^\circ \), confirming that the solution is correct.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
