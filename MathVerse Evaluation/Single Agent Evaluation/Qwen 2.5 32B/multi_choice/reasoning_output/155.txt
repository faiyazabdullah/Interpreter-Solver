QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the student Xiao Li whose height is 1.6 wants to measure the height of the school's flagpole. When he stands at C, the shadow of the top of his head coincides with the shadow of the top of the flagpole, and AC = 2.0, BC = 8.0, then the height of the flagpole is ()

CHOICES:
A:6.4米
B:7米
C:8米
D:9米

To solve the problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. Let's analyze the given information and apply the necessary steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- **Figure Description**: The figure shows a right triangle formed by the student (Xiao Li), the flagpole, and their respective shadows.
- **Given Data**:
  - Height of Xiao Li: \( h_{\text{Li}} = 1.6 \) meters.
  - Distance \( AC = 2.0 \) meters.
  - Distance \( BC = 8.0 \) meters.
  - The shadow of the top of Xiao Li's head coincides with the shadow of the top of the flagpole, implying that the triangles formed by Xiao Li and his shadow, and the flagpole and its shadow, are similar.

### Step 2: Define Variables
- Let the height of the flagpole be \( H \).
- The total distance from \( A \) to \( B \) is \( AB = AC + CB = 2.0 + 8.0 = 10.0 \) meters.
- The shadow length for Xiao Li is \( AC = 2.0 \) meters.
- The shadow length for the flagpole is \( AB = 10.0 \) meters.

### Step 3: Use Similar Triangles
Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Specifically:
\[ \frac{\text{Height of Xiao Li}}{\text{Shadow of Xiao Li}} = \frac{\text{Height of Flagpole}}{\text{Shadow of Flagpole}}. \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ \frac{1.6}{2.0} = \frac{H}{10.0}. \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( H \)
Cross-multiply to solve for \( H \):
\[ 1.6 \cdot 10.0 = 2.0 \cdot H. \]
\[ 16.0 = 2.0H. \]
\[ H = \frac{16.0}{2.0} = 8.0. \]

### Step 5: Verify the Answer
The height of the flagpole is \( H = 8.0 \) meters, which matches one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
