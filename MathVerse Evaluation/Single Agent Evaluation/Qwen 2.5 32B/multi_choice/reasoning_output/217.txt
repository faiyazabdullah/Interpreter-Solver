### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The figure is a parallelogram.
- Two adjacent sides of the parallelogram are given as 20 cm and 12 cm.
- One angle between these sides is \(60^\circ\).

#### **Step 2: Understand the properties of a parallelogram**
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length.
- Therefore, if one pair of adjacent sides is 20 cm and 12 cm, the other pair of opposite sides will also be 20 cm and 12 cm.

#### **Step 3: Determine the perimeter of the parallelogram**
- The perimeter \(P\) of a parallelogram is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
- Since opposite sides are equal, the perimeter can be calculated as:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (\text{length of one pair of opposite sides}) + 2 \times (\text{length of the other pair of opposite sides})
  \]
  Substituting the given side lengths:
  \[
  P = 2 \times 20 + 2 \times 12
  \]

#### **Step 4: Perform the calculations**
- Calculate the contributions from each pair of sides:
  \[
  2 \times 20 = 40 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 \times 12 = 24
  \]
- Add these values to find the total perimeter:
  \[
  P = 40 + 24 = 64
  \]

#### **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices**
- The calculated perimeter is 64 cm.
- The answer choices are:
  A: 60
  B: 62
  C: 64
  D: 66

#### **Step 6: Select the correct answer**
- The calculated perimeter matches exactly with choice C.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
