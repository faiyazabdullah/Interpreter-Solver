### Analysis and Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- **AB is parallel to CD**: This means that AB and CD are straight lines that never intersect.
- **Point E** is on the extended line of CA.
- **Angle BAE = 40°**: This is given directly in the problem.

#### Step 2: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to find the measure of **angle ACD**.

#### Step 3: Apply Geometric Properties
Since AB is parallel to CD, we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals:
- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles (also known as same-side interior angles) are supplementary (sum to 180°).

Here, **CA** acts as a transversal to the parallel lines **AB** and **CD**. Therefore:
- Angle BAE and angle ACD are **consecutive interior angles** because they are on the same side of the transversal CA and between the parallel lines AB and CD.

#### Step 4: Use the Property of Consecutive Interior Angles
Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning their sum is 180°. Therefore:
\[
\text{Angle BAE} + \text{Angle ACD} = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the given value of angle BAE:
\[
40^\circ + \text{Angle ACD} = 180^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Solve for Angle ACD
Rearrange the equation to solve for angle ACD:
\[
\text{Angle ACD} = 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of angle ACD is 140°. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 150°
- B: 140°
- C: 130°
- D: 120°

The correct answer is B.

### Final Answer:
