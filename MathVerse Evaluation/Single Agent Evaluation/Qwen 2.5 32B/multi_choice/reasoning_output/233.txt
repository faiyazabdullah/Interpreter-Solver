### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given an isosceles triangle \( \triangle RST \) with the following information:
- \( \angle SRT = 70^\circ \).
- The triangle is isosceles, which means two of its sides are equal. In this case, the sides \( RS \) and \( RT \) are marked as equal, indicating that \( \angle RST = \angle RTS \).

We need to find the measure of \( \angle RST \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Identify the properties of an isosceles triangle.
In an isosceles triangle, the base angles (the angles opposite the equal sides) are congruent. Here, since \( RS = RT \), we have:
\[ \angle RST = \angle RTS. \]

#### Step 2: Use the angle sum property of a triangle.
The sum of the interior angles of any triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, for \( \triangle RST \):
\[ \angle SRT + \angle RST + \angle RTS = 180^\circ. \]

#### Step 3: Substitute the known values.
We know \( \angle SRT = 70^\circ \) and \( \angle RST = \angle RTS \). Let \( \angle RST = \angle RTS = x \). Substituting these into the angle sum equation:
\[ 70^\circ + x + x = 180^\circ. \]

#### Step 4: Simplify the equation.
Combine like terms:
\[ 70^\circ + 2x = 180^\circ. \]

Subtract \( 70^\circ \) from both sides:
\[ 2x = 110^\circ. \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ x = 55^\circ. \]

#### Step 5: Interpret the result.
Since \( \angle RST = x \), we have:
\[ \angle RST = 55^\circ. \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle RST \) is \( 55^\circ \).
