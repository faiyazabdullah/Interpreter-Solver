### Analysis of the Problem:

We are given a geometric figure where:
- Line \( AB \) is parallel to line \( CD \).
- Angle \( 1 \) is given as \( 136^\circ \).
- Angle \( E \) is a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
- We need to find the measure of angle \( C \).

#### Step 1: Identify the given information and relationships.
1. **Parallel Lines**: Since \( AB \parallel CD \), corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific relationships.
2. **Angle \( 1 \)**: This angle is adjacent to the angle formed by line \( AB \) and the transversal passing through point \( A \). Let's denote the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) as \( \angle 2 \). Since these two angles form a linear pair, we have:
   \[
   \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
   \]
   Substituting \( \angle 1 = 136^\circ \):
   \[
   136^\circ + \angle 2 = 180^\circ \implies \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 136^\circ = 44^\circ
   \]

3. **Transversal and Parallel Lines**: The transversal intersects both \( AB \) and \( CD \). Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the angle formed by the transversal with \( CD \) at point \( C \) (let's call it \( \angle 3 \)) will be equal to \( \angle 2 \) because they are corresponding angles. Therefore:
   \[
   \angle 3 = \angle 2 = 44^\circ
   \]

4. **Right Angle at \( E \)**: Angle \( E \) is given as \( 90^\circ \). This angle is part of the triangle formed by the transversal and the lines \( AB \) and \( CD \).

#### Step 2: Use the properties of the triangle.
In the triangle formed by the transversal and the lines \( AB \) and \( CD \):
- One angle is \( \angle 3 = 44^\circ \).
- Another angle is \( \angle E = 90^\circ \).
- The third angle is \( \angle C \), which we need to find.

The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \). Therefore:
\[
\angle C + \angle 3 + \angle E = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\angle C + 44^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
Simplify:
\[
\angle C + 134^\circ = 180^\circ \implies \angle C = 180^\circ - 134^\circ = 46^\circ
\]

#### Step 3: Compare with the answer choices.
The calculated value of \( \angle C \) is \( 46^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
