QUESTION:
The graph, which is a piecewise function and passes through the origin, shows John's speed while he is competing in a walking race, the x-axis representing Time and the y-axis representing Speed. Which situation corresponds to the graph?

CHOICES:
A:John increases his speed for the first half of the race and then decreases his speed in the second half
B:John increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race
C:John starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then stops as he trips over a stick, but then recovers and is able to increase his speed steadily until the end of the race
D:John starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then continues to steadily increase his pace at a faster rate

### Analysis of the Graph:
The graph provided is a piecewise function that represents John's speed over time during a walking race. Here are the key observations from the graph:

1. **Initial Segment (0 to the first breakpoint):**
   - The graph starts at the origin (0, 0), indicating that John's initial speed is 0.
   - The curve rises gradually, showing that John's speed increases over time. This indicates a steady increase in pace.

2. **Second Segment (first breakpoint to the second breakpoint):**
   - After the first segment, there is a noticeable change in the slope of the graph. The curve becomes steeper, meaning John's speed increases at a faster rate than before.
   - There is no indication of a decrease or plateau in speed during this segment.

3. **Third Segment (second breakpoint onward):**
   - The graph continues to rise steeply, suggesting that John's speed continues to increase at an even faster rate than the previous segment.

### Interpretation of the Graph:
- The graph does not show any decrease in speed or a flat section where speed remains constant. Instead, it consistently shows an increase in speed over time.
- The change in steepness at the breakpoints indicates that the rate of speed increase changes, but it never decreases.

### Evaluation of Answer Choices:
#### **Choice A: John increases his speed for the first half of the race and then decreases his speed in the second half.**
- The graph does not show a decrease in speed at any point. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

#### **Choice B: John increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race.**
- The graph shows a change in the rate of increase (the slope changes at certain points). This indicates that the rate of increase is not constant. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

#### **Choice C: John starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then stops as he trips over a stick, but then recovers and is able to increase his speed steadily until the end of the race.**
- The graph does not show any flat sections where speed remains constant, which would indicate a stop or recovery period. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

#### **Choice D: John starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then continues to steadily increase his speed at a faster rate.**
- This matches the graph perfectly. The initial segment shows a gradual increase in speed, followed by a steeper increase in subsequent segments, indicating that the rate of speed increase accelerates over time.

### Final Answer:
