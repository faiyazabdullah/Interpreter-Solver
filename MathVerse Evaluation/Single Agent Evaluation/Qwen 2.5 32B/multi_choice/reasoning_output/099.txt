### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Identify the given information from the figure:
- **AB** is the diameter of circle \(O\).
- **CD** is a chord of circle \(O\).
- \(\angle ADC = 26^\circ\).

#### Step 2: Understand what needs to be found:
We need to determine the measure of \(\angle CAB\).

#### Step 3: Apply relevant geometric theorems and properties:
1. **Property of a Circle**: An angle inscribed in a semicircle (formed by the diameter) is a right angle. Therefore, \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\) because \(AB\) is the diameter.
2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. However, we will use the fact that \(\angle ADC\) and \(\angle ABC\) subtend the same arc \(AC\), so they are equal.

#### Step 4: Calculate \(\angle ABC\):
Since \(\angle ADC\) and \(\angle ABC\) both subtend the same arc \(AC\), we have:
\[
\angle ABC = \angle ADC = 26^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Use the triangle properties in \(\triangle ABC\):
In \(\triangle ABC\), \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\) (as established earlier). The sum of the angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
\[
\angle CAB + \angle ABC + \angle ACB = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\angle CAB + 26^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
Simplify:
\[
\angle CAB + 116^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle CAB = 180^\circ - 116^\circ = 64^\circ
\]

#### Step 6: Compare the calculated result with the answer choices:
The calculated value of \(\angle CAB\) is \(64^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
