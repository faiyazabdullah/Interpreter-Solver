====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The provided graph shows the function \( g(x) \), which is a quadratic function. From the graph:
- The parabola opens downward, indicating that \( g(x) \) is concave down.
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \( (-5, 6) \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Function \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) = 4x^2 - 108 \) is also a quadratic function. To determine its concavity:
- The general form of a quadratic function is \( ax^2 + bx + c \).
- For \( f(x) = 4x^2 - 108 \), the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( a = 4 \).
- Since \( a > 0 \), the parabola opens upward, meaning \( f(x) \) is concave up.

#### Step 3: Compare the Concavities of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \)
- From the graph, \( g(x) \) is concave down.
- From the analysis of \( f(x) \), \( f(x) \) is concave up.

#### Step 4: Match the Result with the Answer Choices
- \( f(x) \) is concave up.
- \( g(x) \) is concave down.
- Therefore, the functions do not have the same concavity.

#### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
