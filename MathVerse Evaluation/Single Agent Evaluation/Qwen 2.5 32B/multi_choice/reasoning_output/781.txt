### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The figure consists of a quadrilateral (square $ABCE$) and a triangle ($\triangle CDE$).
- $ABCE$ is a square.
- The area of the square $ABCE$ is given as 1.
- $\triangle CDE$ is an equilateral triangle.

#### **Step 2: Determine the side length of the square**
- The area of a square is given by the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{side}^2
  \]
- Given that the area of the square is 1:
  \[
  \text{side}^2 = 1 \implies \text{side} = \sqrt{1} = 1
  \]
- Therefore, each side of the square $ABCE$ has a length of 1.

#### **Step 3: Determine the side length of the equilateral triangle**
- Since $\triangle CDE$ is an equilateral triangle, all its sides are equal.
- One of the sides of the equilateral triangle, $CD$, is also a side of the square $ABCE$. Therefore, $CD = 1$.
- Consequently, the other two sides of the equilateral triangle, $DE$ and $EC$, are also equal to 1.

#### **Step 4: Calculate the perimeter of polygon $ABCDE$**
- The perimeter of polygon $ABCDE$ is the sum of the lengths of all its sides: $AB$, $BC$, $CE$, $ED$, and $DA$.
- From the square $ABCE$:
  - $AB = 1$
  - $BC = 1$
  - $CE = 1$
  - $DA = 1$ (since $DA$ is a side of the square)
- From the equilateral triangle $\triangle CDE$:
  - $ED = 1$
- Summing these lengths:
  \[
  \text{Perimeter} = AB + BC + CE + ED + DA = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
  \]

#### **Step 5: Compare the calculated result with the answer choices**
- The calculated perimeter of polygon $ABCDE$ is 5.
- The answer choices are:
  A. 4
  B. 5
  C. 6
  D. 7
  E. 8

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
