### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the value of \( \tan \alpha \) in the given geometric figure. The coordinates of point \( A \) are given as \( (2.0, 3.0) \). The angle \( \alpha \) is formed between the positive \( x \)-axis and the line segment connecting the origin \( O(0, 0) \) to point \( A(2, 3) \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Coordinates and the Line Segment:**
   - The coordinates of point \( A \) are \( (2, 3) \).
   - The origin \( O \) is at \( (0, 0) \).
   - The line segment \( OA \) forms an angle \( \alpha \) with the positive \( x \)-axis.

2. **Understand the Tangent Function:**
   - The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
   - In this context, \( \tan \alpha = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} \).
   - For the line segment \( OA \):
     - The vertical distance (opposite side) from the origin to point \( A \) is the \( y \)-coordinate of \( A \), which is 3.
     - The horizontal distance (adjacent side) from the origin to point \( A \) is the \( x \)-coordinate of \( A \), which is 2.

3. **Calculate \( \tan \alpha \):**
   \[
   \tan \alpha = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - The slope of the line segment \( OA \) is also given by \( \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{3 - 0}{2 - 0} = \frac{3}{2} \).
   - Since the slope of a line is equal to \( \tan \theta \) where \( \theta \) is the angle the line makes with the positive \( x \)-axis, we confirm that \( \tan \alpha = \frac{3}{2} \).

5. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( \tan \alpha \) is \( \frac{3}{2} \).
   - This matches option B.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
