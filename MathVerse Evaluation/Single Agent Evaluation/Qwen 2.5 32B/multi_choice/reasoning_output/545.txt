QUESTION:
Sia is swinging from a chandelier. The horizontal distance between Sia and the wall, in meters, is modeled by $D(t)$ where $t$ is the time in seconds. The function is graphed below, along with one segment highlighted, a red double arrow from (3.75,3), (3.75,5). What is the meaning of the highlighted segment?

CHOICES:
A:The chandelier is hung 2 meters from the wall.
B:The furthest Sia gets from the point where the chandelier hangs is 2 meters.
C:The chandelier is 2 meters wide.
D:Sia completes 2 swing cycles per second.

====================================================================================================
### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure**
The image shows a graph of the function \( D(t) \), which models the horizontal distance between Sia and the wall as a function of time \( t \). The graph is a sinusoidal wave, indicating periodic motion, such as swinging. The highlighted segment is a vertical line segment from the point \((3.75, 3)\) to \((3.75, 5)\).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships**
- The graph's vertical axis (\( y \)) represents the horizontal distance \( D(t) \) in meters.
- The horizontal axis (\( t \)) represents time in seconds.
- The highlighted segment is vertical, meaning it corresponds to a specific moment in time (\( t = 3.75 \)) and shows the range of distances \( D(t) \) at that instant.
- The endpoints of the segment are \((3.75, 3)\) and \((3.75, 5)\), indicating that at \( t = 3.75 \), the distance \( D(t) \) varies from 3 meters to 5 meters.

#### **Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found**
We need to interpret the meaning of the highlighted segment in the context of the problem. Specifically, we need to determine what the vertical distance (5 meters - 3 meters = 2 meters) represents.

#### **Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Theorems and Logical Deductions**
- The highlighted segment shows the difference in \( D(t) \) at a fixed time \( t = 3.75 \). This difference (2 meters) represents the amplitude of the swing at that moment.
- In the context of a swing, the amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position (the point where the chandelier hangs).
- Therefore, the highlighted segment indicates that the maximum displacement of Sia from the point where the chandelier hangs is 2 meters.

#### **Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices**
- **Choice A**: "The chandelier is hung 2 meters from the wall."  
  This is incorrect because the graph does not indicate the initial position of the chandelier relative to the wall; it only shows the distance \( D(t) \) over time.
  
- **Choice B**: "The furthest Sia gets from the point where the chandelier hangs is 2 meters."  
  This is correct. The highlighted segment shows the range of \( D(t) \) at \( t = 3.75 \), which represents the amplitude of the swing. The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, which is the point where the chandelier hangs.
  
- **Choice C**: "The chandelier is 2 meters wide."  
  This is incorrect because the width of the chandelier is not related to the graph or the highlighted segment.
  
- **Choice D**: "Sia completes 2 swing cycles per second."  
  This is incorrect because the highlighted segment does not provide information about the frequency of the swing cycles. The frequency would be determined by the period of the sinusoidal wave, not by the amplitude.

#### **Step 6: Final Answer**
Based on the analysis, the correct interpretation of the highlighted segment is that it represents the maximum displacement of Sia from the point where the chandelier hangs, which is 2 meters.

**Final Answer: B**
