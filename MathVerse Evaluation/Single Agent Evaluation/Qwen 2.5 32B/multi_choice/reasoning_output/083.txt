### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The figure shows a circle with center \( O \).
   - The central angle \( \angle AOB \) is given as \( 100^\circ \).
   - We need to find the measure of the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \).

#### 2. **Understand the relationship between central and inscribed angles:**
   - A key property of circles is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - Mathematically, if \( \angle AOB \) is a central angle subtending the arc \( AB \), then the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) (which also subtends the same arc \( AB \)) is given by:
     \[
     \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle AOB
     \]

#### 3. **Apply the property:**
   - Here, \( \angle AOB = 100^\circ \).
   - Using the formula for the inscribed angle:
     \[
     \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \times 100^\circ = 50^\circ
     \]

#### 4. **Consider the reflex angle:**
   - The problem asks for the angle \( \angle ACB \), but it is important to note that the angle \( \angle ACB \) is an inscribed angle that subtends the minor arc \( AB \).
   - However, if we consider the reflex angle at the center, the total angle around point \( O \) is \( 360^\circ \). The reflex angle \( \angle AOB \) would be:
     \[
     360^\circ - 100^\circ = 260^\circ
     \]
   - The inscribed angle corresponding to this reflex arc would be:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 260^\circ = 130^\circ
     \]
   - Since the problem does not specify which arc to use, the standard interpretation is the minor arc, leading to \( \angle ACB = 50^\circ \). However, if considering the reflex arc, the angle would be \( 130^\circ \).

#### 5. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   - The answer choices provided are:
     - A: \( 130^\circ \)
     - B: \( 120^\circ \)
     - C: \( 110^\circ \)
     - D: \( 100^\circ \)
   - Given the context and the reflex interpretation, the correct choice is \( 130^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
