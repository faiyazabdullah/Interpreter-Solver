QUESTION:
Consider the graph shown. A curve passes (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), (3,8). As x increases, y increases.


Which of the following relationships could be represented by the given graph?

CHOICES:
A:The number of handshakes, y, made by x people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.
B:The number of layers, y, resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half x times.
C:The number of people, y, attending a parent/teacher conference when there are x parents who each bring 2 children.

### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Graph
The graph shows a curve passing through the points \((0, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((3, 8)\). As \(x\) increases, \(y\) also increases, and the relationship appears to be exponential because the values of \(y\) double as \(x\) increases by 1.

#### Step 2: Understand the Relationship
From the points given:
- When \(x = 0\), \(y = 1\).
- When \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\).
- When \(x = 2\), \(y = 4\).
- When \(x = 3\), \(y = 8\).

This pattern suggests that \(y = 2^x\). This is an exponential function where \(y\) doubles for every increment in \(x\).

#### Step 3: Evaluate Each Answer Choice
We need to determine which scenario matches the relationship \(y = 2^x\).

##### Choice A: The number of handshakes, \(y\), made by \(x\) people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.
- The formula for the number of handshakes among \(x\) people is \(\frac{x(x-1)}{2}\).
- For \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\).
- For \(x = 1\), \(y = 0\).
- For \(x = 2\), \(y = 1\).
- For \(x = 3\), \(y = 3\).

This does not match the given points \((0, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 8)\). Therefore, **Choice A is incorrect**.

##### Choice B: The number of layers, \(y\), resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half \(x\) times.
- When a piece of paper is folded in half once, it results in 2 layers.
- Folding it again results in 4 layers.
- Folding it a third time results in 8 layers.
- This follows the pattern \(y = 2^x\):
  - For \(x = 0\), \(y = 1\) (no folds, original layer).
  - For \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\).
  - For \(x = 2\), \(y = 4\).
  - For \(x = 3\), \(y = 8\).

This matches the given points perfectly. Therefore, **Choice B is correct**.

##### Choice C: The number of people, \(y\), attending a parent/teacher conference when there are \(x\) parents who each bring 2 children.
- If \(x\) parents each bring 2 children, the total number of people is \(x + 2x = 3x\).
- For \(x = 0\), \(y = 0\).
- For \(x = 1\), \(y = 3\).
- For \(x = 2\), \(y = 6\).
- For \(x = 3\), \(y = 9\).

This does not match the given points \((0, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 8)\). Therefore, **Choice C is incorrect**.

#### Step 4: Conclusion
The relationship \(y = 2^x\) is consistent with the scenario described in **Choice B**.
