### Analysis and Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The straight lines \( AB \) and \( CD \) are parallel (\( AB \parallel CD \)).
- The straight line \( EF \) intersects both \( AB \) and \( CD \), creating several angles.
- Angle \( \angle 1 \) is given as \( 100^\circ \).
- We need to find the size of angle \( \angle 2 \).

#### Step 2: Identify key geometric relationships
Since \( AB \parallel CD \) and \( EF \) is a transversal, we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals:
- **Corresponding Angles**: When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal.
- **Alternate Interior Angles**: When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, alternate interior angles are equal.
- **Consecutive Interior Angles**: When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 3: Analyze the given angle \( \angle 1 \)
- \( \angle 1 \) is an angle formed by the transversal \( EF \) and the line \( AB \).
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the angle corresponding to \( \angle 1 \) on the other side of the transversal (on line \( CD \)) will be equal to \( \angle 1 \). However, we need to focus on the relationship between \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \).

#### Step 4: Determine the relationship between \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \)
- \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are **consecutive interior angles** because they are on the same side of the transversal \( EF \) and between the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning their sum is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Calculate \( \angle 2 \)
- Given \( \angle 1 = 100^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 100^\circ = 80^\circ
  \]

#### Step 6: Match the calculated result with the answer choices
- The calculated value of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 80^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A: 10°
  - B: 50°
  - C: 80°
  - D: 100°

#### Final Answer:
The correct answer is \( C \).
