### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The figure shows four lines intersecting at four points.
- Two pairs of lines are parallel to each other.
- The angle \( m \angle 1 = 123^\circ \) is given.
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 14 \).

#### **Step 2: Identify the relationships between the angles**
- Since two pairs of lines are parallel, we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).
  - Vertical angles are equal.

#### **Step 3: Determine the relationship between \( \angle 1 \) and other angles**
- \( \angle 1 \) is given as \( 123^\circ \).
- \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are consecutive interior angles because they are on the same side of the transversal and between the parallel lines.
- Therefore, \( \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Use the properties of parallel lines to find \( \angle 14 \)**
- \( \angle 14 \) is vertically opposite to \( \angle 2 \). Vertically opposite angles are equal.
- Therefore, \( \angle 14 = \angle 2 = 57^\circ \).

#### **Step 5: Verify the calculation**
- \( \angle 1 = 123^\circ \) and \( \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 123^\circ = 57^\circ \).
- Since \( \angle 14 \) is vertically opposite to \( \angle 2 \), \( \angle 14 = 57^\circ \).

#### **Step 6: Compare with the answer choices**
- The calculated value of \( \angle 14 \) is \( 57^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A: 47
  - B: 57
  - C: 67
  - D: 123

#### **Final Answer:**
Final Answer: B
