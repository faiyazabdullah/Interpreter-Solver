QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows the graph of the function \( y = 2^x \). Key observations from the graph:
- The curve starts from the left side of the y-axis and extends indefinitely to the right.
- The y-intercept is at \( (0, 1) \), meaning when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 2^0 = 1 \).
- The graph is entirely above the x-axis, indicating that \( y > 0 \) for all \( x \).
- The function appears to be defined for all values of \( x \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Question
We need to determine the **domain** of the function \( y = 2^x \). The domain refers to the set of all possible input values (\( x \)-values) for which the function is defined.

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
The domain of \( y = 2^x \) is the set of all real numbers \( x \) for which the function is valid. From the graph, we observe that:
- There are no restrictions on \( x \). The function \( y = 2^x \) is defined for all real numbers \( x \), whether positive, negative, or zero.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Mathematical Properties
The function \( y = 2^x \) is an exponential function with base 2. Exponential functions of the form \( a^x \) (where \( a > 0 \) and \( a \neq 1 \)) are defined for all real numbers \( x \). This means:
- There are no values of \( x \) that make the function undefined.
- The domain of \( y = 2^x \) is all real numbers.

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The answer choices are:
A. \( x \geq 0 \)
B. \( x > 0 \)
C. All real \( x \)
D. \( x < 0 \)

From our analysis, the function \( y = 2^x \) is defined for all real numbers \( x \). Therefore, the correct choice is:
- **All real \( x \)**.

#### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
