### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- Line segment \( AB \) is parallel to line segment \( CD \).
- \( \angle B = 20^\circ \).
- \( \angle D = 60^\circ \).

We need to find the measure of \( \angle BED \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals.
- \( \angle B \) and \( \angle D \) are given as \( 20^\circ \) and \( 60^\circ \), respectively.
- \( \angle BED \) is the angle we need to find.

#### Step 2: Use the properties of parallel lines
When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific relationships. Here, \( AB \parallel CD \), so we can use these properties.

#### Step 3: Identify key angles
- Let \( BE \) and \( ED \) be the lines forming \( \angle BED \).
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the transversal \( BE \) creates corresponding or alternate interior angles with \( AB \) and \( CD \).

#### Step 4: Calculate the angle at point \( E \)
To find \( \angle BED \), we need to consider the angles around point \( E \):
- The sum of the angles around point \( E \) formed by the intersection of lines \( BE \) and \( ED \) with the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( CD \) must be analyzed.

#### Step 5: Use the exterior angle theorem
The exterior angle theorem states that the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Here, we can consider \( \triangle BED \) or the angles formed by the transversal.

- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the angle \( \angle BED \) can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles on a straight line is \( 180^\circ \).

#### Step 6: Calculate \( \angle BED \)
- The angle \( \angle BED \) is the sum of the angles formed by the transversal intersecting the parallel lines.
- Specifically, \( \angle BED = 180^\circ - (\angle B + \angle D) \).

However, since \( \angle B \) and \( \angle D \) are not directly adjacent but are part of the transversal, we use the fact that the angles around point \( E \) must sum up correctly. The correct approach is to recognize that:
\[ \angle BED = 180^\circ - (\text{the sum of the angles on the same side of the transversal}) \]

Given:
\[ \angle B = 20^\circ \]
\[ \angle D = 60^\circ \]

The angle \( \angle BED \) is the supplementary angle to the sum of the interior angles on the same side of the transversal:
\[ \angle BED = 180^\circ - (180^\circ - 20^\circ - 60^\circ) = 20^\circ + 60^\circ = 80^\circ \]

#### Final Calculation:
Thus, the measure of \( \angle BED \) is:
\[ \angle BED = 80^\circ \]

### Conclusion:
The degree of \( \angle BED \) is \( 80^\circ \).
