### Problem Analysis:
The image shows four straight lines \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). Angles are marked at their intersections. The problem provides the following information:
- \(\angle 1 = 58^\circ\)
- \(\angle 2 = 58^\circ\)
- \(\angle 3 = 70^\circ\)

We need to determine the measure of \(\angle 4\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the relationships between the angles**
- **Angles 1 and 2**: These angles are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal \(c\) intersecting lines \(a\) and \(b\). Since \(\angle 1 = \angle 2 = 58^\circ\), lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel (\(a \parallel b\)) because alternate interior angles are congruent when the lines are parallel.

#### **Step 2: Use the property of corresponding angles**
- Since \(a \parallel b\), the transversal \(d\) will form corresponding angles with lines \(a\) and \(b\).
- \(\angle 3\) is given as \(70^\circ\). This angle is an interior angle on one side of the transversal \(d\).
- \(\angle 4\) is the supplementary angle to \(\angle 3\) because they form a linear pair (they are adjacent angles on a straight line).

#### **Step 3: Calculate \(\angle 4\)** 
- The sum of angles forming a linear pair is \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
  \[
  \angle 4 + \angle 3 = 180^\circ
  \]
  Substituting the given value of \(\angle 3\):
  \[
  \angle 4 + 70^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  Solving for \(\angle 4\):
  \[
  \angle 4 = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 4: Verify the result**
- The calculation is consistent with the properties of parallel lines and the supplementary angle relationship. Thus, \(\angle 4 = 110^\circ\) is correct.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
