QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Analyze the Given Information
- **Triangles**: We have two triangles, \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle BDE \).
- **Angle Congruences**:
  - \( \angle A \cong \angle BED \)
  - \( \angle C \cong \angle D \)
- **Side Ratio**: The ratio of the lengths \( AB \) to \( EB \) is \( 5:1 \), i.e., \( \frac{AB}{EB} = 5 \).
- **Area of \( \triangle BDE \)**: The area of \( \triangle BDE \) is given as \( 5a^2 + 10 \).

### Step 2: Identify Similarity
From the given angle congruences:
- \( \angle A \cong \angle BED \)
- \( \angle C \cong \angle D \)
- Since \( \angle B \) is common to both triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle BDE \), we have:
  - \( \angle B \cong \angle B \)

By the **AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion**, \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle BDE \).

### Step 3: Use Similarity Properties
Since \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle BDE \), the corresponding sides are proportional. The ratio of the corresponding sides is given by:
\[ \frac{AB}{EB} = 5. \]

The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Therefore, the ratio of the areas of \( \triangle ABC \) to \( \triangle BDE \) is:
\[ \left( \frac{AB}{EB} \right)^2 = 5^2 = 25. \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Area of \( \triangle ABC \)
Let the area of \( \triangle ABC \) be \( A_{ABC} \). The area of \( \triangle BDE \) is given as \( 5a^2 + 10 \). Using the area ratio:
\[ \frac{A_{ABC}}{A_{BDE}} = 25. \]
Substituting the given area of \( \triangle BDE \):
\[ \frac{A_{ABC}}{5a^2 + 10} = 25. \]
Solving for \( A_{ABC} \):
\[ A_{ABC} = 25 \cdot (5a^2 + 10). \]
\[ A_{ABC} = 125a^2 + 250. \]

### Step 5: Match with Answer Choices
The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is \( 125a^2 + 250 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices, we find that it matches choice **D**.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
