### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given a circle with center \( O \), where \( AB \) is the diameter, \( CD \) is a chord, and \( AB \perp CD \). The foot of the perpendicular is the point \( E \). Additionally, we know that \( \angle BOC = 30^\circ \). We need to find the measure of \( \angle BAD \).

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle.
- \( CD \) is a chord, and \( AB \perp CD \) at point \( E \).
- \( \angle BOC = 30^\circ \).
- We need to find \( \angle BAD \).

#### Step 2: Use properties of circles and angles
1. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Relationship:**
   - The central angle \( \angle BOC \) subtends the arc \( BC \).
   - The inscribed angle \( \angle BAC \) that subtends the same arc \( BC \) is half the measure of the central angle \( \angle BOC \). Therefore,
     \[
     \angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \angle BOC = \frac{1}{2} \times 30^\circ = 15^\circ.
     \]

2. **Right Triangle Properties:**
   - Since \( AB \) is the diameter, \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \) (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle).
   - In \( \triangle ABD \), \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \).

3. **Angle Relationships in \( \triangle ABD \):**
   - In \( \triangle ABD \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \).
   - We already know \( \angle ADB = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle BAD \) is one of the acute angles.
   - Since \( \angle BAC = 15^\circ \) and \( \angle BAC \) is part of \( \angle BAD \), we have:
     \[
     \angle BAD = \angle BAC = 15^\circ.
     \]

#### Step 3: Verify the solution
- The key insight is that \( \angle BAC \) (which is \( 15^\circ \)) is the same as \( \angle BAD \) because \( \angle BAC \) is the angle formed by the chord \( AC \) and the radius \( AB \), and it is part of the larger angle \( \angle BAD \).
- Since \( \angle BAC = 15^\circ \) and there are no other angles to add or subtract, \( \angle BAD = 15^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
