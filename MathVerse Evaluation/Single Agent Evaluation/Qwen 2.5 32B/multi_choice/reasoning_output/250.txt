### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information and the geometric relationships**
- **J K L M** is a rectangle.
  - All internal angles of a rectangle are \(90^\circ\).
  - Opposite sides are equal and parallel.

- **M L P R** is a rhombus.
  - All sides of a rhombus are equal.
  - Opposite angles are equal.
  - Diagonals bisect each other at right angles.

- We are given:
  - \(\angle J M K = 55^\circ\)
  - \(\angle M R P = 70^\circ\)
  - \(\angle J M K \cong \angle R M P\), which means \(\angle R M P = 55^\circ\).

- We need to find \(m \angle K L P\).

---

#### **Step 2: Analyze the rectangle J K L M**
In the rectangle \(J K L M\):
- Since \(\angle J M K = 55^\circ\) and \(\angle J M K\) is part of the rectangle, we can use the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle do not affect the internal angles of the rectangle itself. However, the angle \(\angle J M K\) helps us understand the configuration of the points.

#### **Step 3: Analyze the rhombus M L P R**
In the rhombus \(M L P R\):
- The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.
- Given \(\angle M R P = 70^\circ\), we know that the opposite angle \(\angle M L P\) is also \(70^\circ\) because opposite angles in a rhombus are equal.
- Since \(\angle R M P = 55^\circ\), the diagonal \(M R\) bisects \(\angle M R P\) into two equal parts. Therefore, the other half of \(\angle M R P\) is also \(55^\circ\).

#### **Step 4: Determine \(\angle K L P\)** 
To find \(\angle K L P\), we need to consider the relationship between the rectangle and the rhombus. Specifically, we need to analyze the angles formed by the intersection of the diagonals and the sides of the shapes.

1. **Identify key angles in the rhombus:**
   - Since \(M L P R\) is a rhombus, the diagonals \(M R\) and \(L P\) bisect each other at right angles (\(90^\circ\)).
   - The angle \(\angle M L P = 70^\circ\) is part of the rhombus.

2. **Use the properties of the rectangle:**
   - In the rectangle \(J K L M\), \(\angle J M K = 55^\circ\). Since \(J K L M\) is a rectangle, the angle \(\angle K M L = 90^\circ\).

3. **Relate the angles in the rhombus to the rectangle:**
   - The point \(M\) is a common vertex for both the rectangle and the rhombus.
   - The angle \(\angle K M L = 90^\circ\) from the rectangle affects the configuration of the rhombus.
   - The angle \(\angle K L P\) is part of the rhombus and can be determined by considering the internal angles of the rhombus and the rectangle.

4. **Calculate \(\angle K L P\):**
   - In the rhombus, the angle \(\angle M L P = 70^\circ\).
   - The diagonal \(L P\) divides the rhombus into two congruent triangles.
   - Since the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, the angle \(\angle K L P\) is supplementary to the angle formed by the diagonal \(L P\) and the side \(K L\).

5. **Use the supplementary angle property:**
   - The angle \(\angle K L P\) is part of the triangle formed by the diagonal \(L P\) and the sides of the rhombus.
   - The sum of the angles around point \(L\) in the rhombus is \(360^\circ\).
   - The angle \(\angle K L P\) is supplementary to the angle \(\angle M L P = 70^\circ\).

6. **Final calculation:**
   - Since \(\angle K L P\) is part of the rhombus and the rectangle, we use the fact that the angle \(\angle K L P\) is the external angle formed by the diagonals and sides.
   - The angle \(\angle K L P = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ\).

---

#### **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated value of \(\angle K L P\) is \(110^\circ\).
