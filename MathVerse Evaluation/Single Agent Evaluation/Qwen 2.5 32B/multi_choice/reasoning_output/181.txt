### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- Circle \( O \) is the circumcircle of triangle \( ABC \).
- \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle.
- \( OC = 5 \), where \( O \) is the center of the circle.
- \( AC = 6 \).

We need to find the length of \( BC \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding the given information**
1. Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle, \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle).
2. \( O \) is the center of the circle, so \( OA = OB = OC = 5 \) (the radius of the circle).
3. We are tasked with finding the length of \( BC \).

#### **Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AOC \)**
In \( \triangle AOC \):
- \( OA = 5 \) (radius of the circle).
- \( AC = 6 \).
- \( OC = 5 \).

Since \( O \) is the center, \( A \) and \( C \) are points on the circle, and \( OC \) is a radius. However, \( \triangle AOC \) is not a right triangle, so we need to focus on \( \triangle ABC \).

#### **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \)**
In \( \triangle ABC \):
- \( AB \) is the diameter, so \( AB = 2 \times OC = 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
- \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) (since \( AB \) is the diameter).
- We know \( AC = 6 \) and need to find \( BC \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
10^2 = 6^2 + BC^2
\]
\[
100 = 36 + BC^2
\]
\[
BC^2 = 100 - 36
\]
\[
BC^2 = 64
\]
\[
BC = \sqrt{64} = 8
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the result**
The calculation is consistent with the Pythagorean theorem, and all given conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
