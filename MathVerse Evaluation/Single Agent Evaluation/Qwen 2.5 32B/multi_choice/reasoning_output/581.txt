CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine whether the given function has an inverse, we need to analyze the properties of the function as depicted in the graph. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Step 1: Examine the given points and behavior of the function
- The function passes through the points \((0, -2)\), \((3, 0)\), and starts at \((-1, -5)\).
- From the graph, we observe that the function is increasing throughout its domain. This means that as \(x\) increases, \(y\) also increases.

### Step 2: Check for the Horizontal Line Test
- A function has an inverse if and only if it is **one-to-one**. A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once.
- Visually inspecting the graph, we see that no horizontal line can intersect the curve more than once. This confirms that the function is one-to-one.

### Step 3: Verify monotonicity
- The function appears to be strictly increasing, which is another way to confirm that it is one-to-one. A strictly increasing function will pass the Horizontal Line Test.

### Step 4: Conclusion
- Since the function is one-to-one (as confirmed by the Horizontal Line Test and its strictly increasing nature), it has an inverse.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
