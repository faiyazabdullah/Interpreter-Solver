QUESTION:
A fly is standing on a bike wheel in motion. The vertical distance between the fly and the ground, in centimeters, is modeled by $H(t)$ where $t$ is the time in seconds. The function is graphed below, along with one segment highlighted, a red double arrow from (1,50) to (5,50). What is the meaning of the highlighted segment?

CHOICES:
A:The wheel completes a single cycle in 4 seconds.
B:The height of the wheel's center is 4 centimeters.
C:The radius of the wheel is 4 centimeters.
D:The bike's speed is 4 centimeters per second.

### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Graph
The graph shows the function \( H(t) \), which represents the vertical distance between a fly on a bike wheel and the ground as a function of time \( t \) in seconds. The graph is periodic, indicating that the fly's movement is cyclical, consistent with the rotational motion of a bike wheel.

#### Step 2: Identifying Key Features
- **Amplitude**: The maximum height of the graph is 50 cm, and the minimum height is 0 cm. This suggests the wheel's diameter is related to these values.
- **Period**: The highlighted segment runs from \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 5 \). This segment is horizontal, indicating that the fly's height remains constant during this interval.
- **Highlighted Segment**: The segment from \( (1, 50) \) to \( (5, 50) \) shows that the fly's height is constant at 50 cm for 4 seconds (from \( t = 1 \) to \( t = 5 \)).

#### Step 3: Interpreting the Highlighted Segment
The highlighted segment represents a period where the fly's height does not change. This occurs when the fly is at the topmost point of the wheel, which is directly above the wheel's center. During this time, the wheel completes one full rotation.

#### Step 4: Relating to the Wheel's Motion
- **Wheel's Center Height**: The maximum height of the fly (50 cm) corresponds to the top of the wheel. Since the fly's height is constant at 50 cm for 4 seconds, this indicates the wheel's center is 25 cm above the ground (half the diameter).
- **Period of the Wheel**: The highlighted segment spans 4 seconds, which is the time it takes for the wheel to complete one full rotation. This is the period of the motion.

#### Step 5: Evaluating Answer Choices
- **Choice A**: "The wheel completes a single cycle in 4 seconds."
  - The highlighted segment shows that the fly's height is constant for 4 seconds, which corresponds to one full rotation of the wheel. This is consistent with the period of the motion.
- **Choice B**: "The height of the wheel's center is 4 centimeters."
  - The height of the wheel's center is actually 25 cm (half the diameter), not 4 cm. This is incorrect.
- **Choice C**: "The radius of the wheel is 4 centimeters."
  - The radius of the wheel is half the diameter. Since the maximum height is 50 cm and the minimum height is 0 cm, the diameter is 50 cm, making the radius 25 cm. This is incorrect.
- **Choice D**: "The bike's speed is 4 centimeters per second."
  - The highlighted segment does not provide information about the bike's speed. It only shows the period of the wheel's rotation. This is incorrect.

#### Final Answer:
The highlighted segment indicates that the wheel completes one full rotation in 4 seconds.
