====================================================================================================
To solve for the value of \( x \), we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use the properties of angles formed by intersecting lines. Let's go through the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- \( r = 90^\circ \): This means \( \angle EPC = 90^\circ \).
- \( s = 50^\circ \): This means \( \angle BPF = 50^\circ \).
- \( t = 60^\circ \): This means \( \angle CPF = 60^\circ \).
- \( u = 45^\circ \): This means \( \angle DPA = 45^\circ \).
- \( w = 50^\circ \): This means \( \angle APB = 50^\circ \).

We need to find the value of \( x \), which is \( \angle CPA \).

### Step 2: Use the properties of angles around point \( P \)
Since all angles around point \( P \) sum up to \( 360^\circ \), we can write:
\[
\angle EPC + \angle CPA + \angle APB + \angle BPF + \angle CPF = 360^\circ
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
90^\circ + x + 50^\circ + 50^\circ + 60^\circ = 360^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation
Combine the known angles:
\[
90^\circ + x + 50^\circ + 50^\circ + 60^\circ = 360^\circ
\]
\[
90^\circ + x + 160^\circ = 360^\circ
\]
\[
x + 250^\circ = 360^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
\[
x = 360^\circ - 250^\circ
\]
\[
x = 110^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Verify the consistency with other angles
We need to ensure that our value of \( x \) is consistent with the given angles and the properties of the figure. Since \( x = 110^\circ \) satisfies the sum of angles around point \( P \), it is correct.

### Step 6: Check the answer choices
The value \( x = 110^\circ \) does not match any of the given answer choices (A: 45, B: 50, C: 65, D: 75). Therefore, the correct answer is that it cannot be determined from the information given.

### Final Answer:
