### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Given Information**
- The figure shows a right circular cone.
- The **generatrix** (slant height) of the cone is given as \(5.0\) cm.
- The **height** of the cone is given as \(4.0\) cm.
- We need to find the **bottom area** of the cone, which is the area of the base circle.

#### **Step 2: Identify Key Relationships**
The generatrix, height, and radius of the base form a right triangle. The generatrix is the hypotenuse of this right triangle, the height is one leg, and the radius of the base is the other leg. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can relate these quantities:
\[
\text{Generatrix}^2 = \text{Height}^2 + \text{Radius}^2
\]

#### **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
Let \( r \) be the radius of the base of the cone. According to the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
5^2 = 4^2 + r^2
\]
\[
25 = 16 + r^2
\]
Subtract \(16\) from both sides:
\[
r^2 = 9
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
r = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the Bottom Area of the Cone**
The bottom area of the cone is the area of the base circle, which is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 3 \):
\[
\text{Area} = \pi (3)^2 = 9\pi
\]

#### **Step 5: Compare with the Answer Choices**
The calculated bottom area is \(9\pi\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \(3\pi\)
- B: \(9\pi\)
- C: \(16\pi\)
- D: \(25\pi\)

The correct answer is \(9\pi\).

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
