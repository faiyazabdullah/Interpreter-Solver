### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the radius of a sector that, when folded, forms a cone. The given information includes:
- The radius of the original circle is \( r = 1 \).
- The central angle of the sector is \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
1. **Original Circle**: The radius of the original circle is \( r = 1 \). When a sector is cut out, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
2. **Sector Details**: The central angle of the sector is \( 90^\circ \), which is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a full circle (since \( 90^\circ / 360^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \)).
3. **Arc Length of the Sector**: The arc length \( L \) of the sector is a fraction of the circumference of the original circle. The circumference of the original circle is \( 2\pi r = 2\pi \cdot 1 = 2\pi \). Since the sector's central angle is \( 90^\circ \), the arc length is:
   \[
   L = \frac{90^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]
4. **Cone Formation**: When the sector is folded into a cone, the arc length \( L \) becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let \( R \) be the radius of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base of the cone is \( 2\pi R \). Therefore:
   \[
   2\pi R = \frac{\pi}{2}
   \]
   Solving for \( R \):
   \[
   R = \frac{\pi/2}{2\pi} = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

#### Step 2: Radius of the Sector
The radius of the sector is the same as the slant height of the cone, which is the radius of the original circle. This is because the radius of the original circle remains unchanged when the sector is cut out and folded. Thus, the radius of the sector is \( r = 1 \).

#### Step 3: Re-evaluating the Question
Upon re-reading the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding. The question asks for the radius of the sector, which is the radius of the original circle used to cut the sector. Since the radius of the original circle is given as 1, the radius of the sector is also 1.

However, if we interpret the problem as asking for the slant height of the cone formed, which is the radius of the original circle, the radius of the sector is still 1. But the problem seems to be asking for a different interpretation, possibly related to the unfolded sector's dimensions.

Given the answer choices, let us consider the unfolded sector's dimensions:
- The arc length of the sector is \( \frac{\pi}{2} \).
- The central angle is \( 90^\circ \), which means the sector is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the circle.
- The radius of the sector is the same as the radius of the original circle, which is 1.

#### Final Calculation
The radius of the sector is the same as the radius of the original circle, which is 1. However, the answer choices provided do not match this interpretation. Upon re-evaluating, the problem might be asking for a different interpretation, such as the slant height or another dimension. Given the choices, the correct interpretation aligns with the radius of the original circle, which is 1.

#### Conclusion
The radius of the sector is the same as the radius of the original circle, which is 1. However, since the answer choices do not match this directly, we must select the closest reasonable interpretation. The correct radius of the sector, based on the problem's context, is 1, but the closest answer choice provided is:
