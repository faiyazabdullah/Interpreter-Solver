QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are given a rhombus \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at point \(E\). The side lengths of the rhombus are given as follows:
- \(AB = 2x + 3\)
- \(BC = 5x\)

Since all sides of a rhombus are equal, we have:
\[ AB = BC = CD = DA \]

This implies:
\[ 2x + 3 = 5x \]

We need to solve for \(x\) and then determine the measure of \(\angle AEB\).

### Step 1: Solve for \(x\)
From the equation \(2x + 3 = 5x\):
\[ 2x + 3 = 5x \]
\[ 3 = 5x - 2x \]
\[ 3 = 3x \]
\[ x = 1 \]

### Step 2: Verify the side length
Substituting \(x = 1\) into the expressions for the side lengths:
\[ AB = 2x + 3 = 2(1) + 3 = 5 \]
\[ BC = 5x = 5(1) = 5 \]

Thus, all sides of the rhombus are equal to 5, confirming that the rhombus is valid.

### Step 3: Properties of the diagonals in a rhombus
In a rhombus, the diagonals:
1. Bisect each other.
2. Are perpendicular to each other.

This means that the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at point \(E\) such that:
\[ \angle AEB = 90^\circ \]

### Step 4: Conclusion
Since the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular, the measure of \(\angle AEB\) is:
\[ \angle AEB = 90^\circ \]

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
