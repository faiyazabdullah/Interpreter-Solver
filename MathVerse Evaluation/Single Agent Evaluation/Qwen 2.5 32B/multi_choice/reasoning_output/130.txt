### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the diameter of the circle given the following information:
- Chord \( AB = 10 \)
- Circumference angle \( \angle ACB = 45^\circ \)
- Point \( D \) is on the circle such that \( AD \) is the diameter.

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
1. **Circumference Angle and Central Angle Relationship**:
   - The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of the corresponding circumference angle subtended by the same arc.
   - Therefore, the central angle \( \angle AOB \) (subtended by the same arc \( AB \)) is:
     \[
     \angle AOB = 2 \times \angle ACB = 2 \times 45^\circ = 90^\circ.
     \]

2. **Triangle \( \triangle AOB \)**:
   - \( \triangle AOB \) is an isosceles triangle because \( OA \) and \( OB \) are radii of the circle.
   - Since \( \angle AOB = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle AOB \) is a right triangle with \( \angle AOB \) as the right angle.

3. **Length of Chord \( AB \)**:
   - In \( \triangle AOB \), \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
   - Let the radius of the circle be \( r \). Then \( OA = OB = r \).

#### Step 2: Applying the Pythagorean Theorem
In \( \triangle AOB \):
\[
AB^2 = OA^2 + OB^2
\]
Substitute \( AB = 10 \) and \( OA = OB = r \):
\[
10^2 = r^2 + r^2
\]
\[
100 = 2r^2
\]
Solve for \( r^2 \):
\[
r^2 = \frac{100}{2} = 50
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
r = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 3: Finding the Diameter
The diameter \( AD \) of the circle is twice the radius:
\[
AD = 2r = 2 \times 5\sqrt{2} = 10\sqrt{2}
\]

#### Step 4: Comparing with Answer Choices
The calculated diameter is \( 10\sqrt{2} \). This matches option B.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
