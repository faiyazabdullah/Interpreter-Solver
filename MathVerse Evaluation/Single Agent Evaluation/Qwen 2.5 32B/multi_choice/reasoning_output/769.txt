### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a rectangle divided into eight triangles by four lines passing through its center. These lines appear to be drawn symmetrically, creating congruent triangles. The shaded region consists of two of these triangles.

#### Step 2: Understand the Relationships
- The rectangle is divided into **eight congruent triangles** because the lines are drawn symmetrically through the center.
- Each triangle has the same area since they are congruent.
- The shaded region includes **two of these triangles**.

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine what fraction of the total area of the rectangle is shaded.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Principles
- Since the rectangle is divided into eight congruent triangles, each triangle represents **1/8** of the total area of the rectangle.
- The shaded region consists of **two such triangles**, so the shaded area is:
  \[
  \text{Shaded Area} = 2 \times \left(\frac{1}{8} \text{ of the rectangle}\right) = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
  \]

#### Step 5: Perform Calculations
The fraction of the area of the rectangle that is shaded is:
\[
\frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated fraction is \(\frac{1}{4}\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. \( \frac{3}{8} \)
- B. \( \frac{1}{4} \)
- C. \( \frac{1}{8} \)
- D. \( \frac{1}{10} \)
- E. \( \frac{1}{16} \)

The correct answer matches choice B.

### Final Answer:
