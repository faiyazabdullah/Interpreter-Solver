### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Given Information**
- The figure shows two parallel lines: \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- There is an angle labeled \( \angle 2 \) which is given as \( 135^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the lines are parallel, and the transversal creates several angle relationships.
- \( \angle 2 \) is an interior angle on the same side of the transversal, and it is given as \( 135^\circ \).

#### **Step 3: Identify Relevant Angle Properties**
- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, the following properties hold:
  1. **Consecutive Interior Angles**: Angles on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines are supplementary. That is, their sum is \( 180^\circ \).
  2. **Corresponding Angles**: Angles in the same relative position are congruent.
  3. **Alternate Interior Angles**: Angles on opposite sides of the transversal and between the two parallel lines are congruent.

#### **Step 4: Apply the Supplementary Angle Property**
- Since \( \angle 2 \) is an interior angle on the same side of the transversal, it is supplementary to the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) on the same side of the transversal.
- Let the angle adjacent to \( \angle 1 \) on the same side of the transversal be \( \angle x \). Then:
  \[
  \angle x + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]
  Substituting \( \angle 2 = 135^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle x + 135^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  Solving for \( \angle x \):
  \[
  \angle x = 180^\circ - 135^\circ = 45^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 5: Determine \( \angle 1 \)**
- \( \angle 1 \) is the corresponding angle to \( \angle x \) because they are on the same side of the transversal and above the parallel lines.
- Corresponding angles are congruent when the lines are parallel. Therefore:
  \[
  \angle 1 = \angle x = 45^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices**
- The calculated value of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 45^\circ \).
- The answer choices are:
  - A: \( 30^\circ \)
  - B: \( 45^\circ \)
  - C: \( 60^\circ \)
  - D: \( 75^\circ \)

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
