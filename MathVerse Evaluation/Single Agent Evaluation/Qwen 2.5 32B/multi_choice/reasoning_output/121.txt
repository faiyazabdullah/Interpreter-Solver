QUESTION:
The production process of paper umbrellas in our country is very ingenious. As shown in the figure, whether the umbrella is opened or closed, the handle AP always bisects the angle angle BAC formed by the two ribs in the same plane, and AE = AF, DE = DF, so as to ensure that the umbrella ring can slide along the handle. When a toy umbrella is opened, the BDC is on the same straight line. If AB = 50.0, AD = 14.0, then the area of ​​oil paper required to make such a paper umbrella is (don't remember the seam) ()

CHOICES:
A:48cm^{2}
B:70πcm^{2}
C:2400πcm^{2}
D:2500πcm^{2}

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the area of the oil paper required to make the paper umbrella. Let's go through the solution step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Geometry and Given Information
- The umbrella is symmetrical about the handle \( AP \), which bisects \( \angle BAC \).
- \( AE = AF \) and \( DE = DF \), ensuring symmetry.
- When the umbrella is open, \( BDC \) is a straight line.
- \( AB = 50.0 \) cm and \( AD = 14.0 \) cm.

### Step 2: Determine the Radius of the Umbrella
The radius of the umbrella is the length of the rib \( AB \). From the problem, we know:
\[ AB = 50.0 \text{ cm} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Area of the Oil Paper
The oil paper forms a circular sector when the umbrella is open. The full circle would have a radius equal to the length of the rib \( AB \), which is 50.0 cm. However, since the umbrella is symmetrical and the oil paper covers the entire circular area when open, we need to calculate the area of a full circle.

The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[ \text{Area} = \pi r^2 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Here, the radius \( r = AB = 50.0 \) cm. Substituting the value:
\[ \text{Area} = \pi (50.0)^2 = \pi \cdot 2500 = 2500\pi \text{ cm}^2 \]

### Step 4: Match the Result with the Answer Choices
The calculated area is \( 2500\pi \text{ cm}^2 \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 48 cm²
- B: 70π cm²
- C: 2400π cm²
- D: 2500π cm²

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]

### Final Answer: D
