### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Identify Given Information**
- Line \( b \) is perpendicular to line \( c \). This means \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).
- The foot of the perpendicular is point \( A \).
- Angle \( \angle 1 = 70^\circ \).
- Line \( b \) is parallel to line \( a \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
- Since \( b \parallel a \), the angles formed by the transversal \( c \) will follow the properties of parallel lines.
- Specifically, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles will have specific relationships.

#### **Step 3: Analyze the Angles**
- From the figure, \( \angle 1 \) is an angle formed between line \( a \) and the transversal \( c \). It is given as \( 70^\circ \).
- Since \( b \parallel a \), the corresponding angle to \( \angle 1 \) on line \( b \) (let's call it \( \angle 2 \)) will also be \( 70^\circ \). This is because corresponding angles are equal when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal.

#### **Step 4: Use Perpendicularity**
- Line \( b \) is perpendicular to line \( c \), so \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \).
- The angle between line \( b \) and the transversal \( c \) is \( 90^\circ \). However, we need to determine how much line \( b \) needs to be rotated clockwise around point \( A \) to align with line \( a \).

#### **Step 5: Determine the Rotation**
- Since \( \angle 1 = 70^\circ \) and \( \angle BAC = 90^\circ \), the angle between line \( b \) and line \( a \) is the difference between these two angles.
- Therefore, the angle of rotation needed to align line \( b \) with line \( a \) is:
  \[
  90^\circ - 70^\circ = 20^\circ
  \]

#### **Step 6: Conclusion**
- The line \( b \) needs to be rotated \( 20^\circ \) clockwise around point \( A \) to align with line \( a \).
