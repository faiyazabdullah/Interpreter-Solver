### Analysis of the Image and Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
- The image shows a unit circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The radius of the circle is 1.
- A point \( P(x, y) \) lies on the circumference of the circle.
- An angle \(\theta\) is formed between the positive \( x \)-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point \( P \).

#### Step 2: Understand the Measurements and Relationships
- Since \( P(x, y) \) lies on the unit circle, the coordinates \( (x, y) \) satisfy the equation of the unit circle:
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = 1
  \]
- The angle \(\theta\) is the angle in standard position, where the initial side is the positive \( x \)-axis, and the terminal side passes through the point \( P(x, y) \).
- By definition of trigonometric functions in terms of the unit circle:
  - \( \cos \theta = x \)
  - \( \sin \theta = y \)

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
- We need to find the value of \(\sec \theta\).

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Formulas
- The secant function is defined as the reciprocal of the cosine function:
  \[
  \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta}
  \]
- From the unit circle, we know:
  \[
  \cos \theta = x
  \]
- Therefore:
  \[
  \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{1}{x}
  \]

#### Step 5: Show Calculations Clearly
- Using the relationship \(\cos \theta = x\):
  \[
  \sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{1}{x}
  \]

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
- The calculated value of \(\sec \theta\) is \(\frac{1}{x}\).
- The answer choices are:
  A: \(\frac{1}{x}\)
  B: \(x\)
  C: \(y\)
  D: \(\frac{1}{y}\)

#### Final Answer:
The correct answer is \(\frac{1}{x}\), which corresponds to choice A.

Final Answer: A
