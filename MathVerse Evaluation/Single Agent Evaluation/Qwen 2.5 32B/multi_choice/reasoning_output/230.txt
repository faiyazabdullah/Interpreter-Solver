### Analysis of the Problem:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle 2 \) in a circle where two chords \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersect. The given information includes:
- \( m\widehat{BC} = 30^\circ \)
- \( m\widehat{AD} = 20^\circ \)

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Relationships**
When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed by the intersection is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle. Specifically, for angle \( \angle 2 \):
\[ 
m\angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( m\widehat{BC} + m\widehat{AD} \right)
\]
This formula comes from the **Intersecting Chords Angle Theorem**, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle.

#### **Step 2: Substitute the Given Values**
From the problem, we know:
- \( m\widehat{BC} = 30^\circ \)
- \( m\widehat{AD} = 20^\circ \)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
m\angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( m\widehat{BC} + m\widehat{AD} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( 30^\circ + 20^\circ \right)
\]

#### **Step 3: Perform the Calculation**
First, calculate the sum of the arc measures:
\[
30^\circ + 20^\circ = 50^\circ
\]
Then, divide by 2:
\[
m\angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 50^\circ = 25^\circ
\]

#### **Step 4: Compare with Answer Choices**
The calculated value of \( m\angle 2 \) is \( 25^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 20
- B: 25
- C: 30
- D: 155

The correct answer is \( 25 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
