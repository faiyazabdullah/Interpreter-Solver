### Problem Analysis:
The image shows two quadrilaterals: a blue one and a green one. Both are rhombuses (since their diagonals bisect each other at right angles). The following information is provided:
- Diagonal length of the blue rhombus: 8 yd.
- Diagonal length of the green rhombus: 4 yd.
- Area of the blue rhombus: 36 yd².
- The two rhombuses are similar figures.

We need to find the area of the green rhombus.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the relationship between similar figures**
For two similar figures, the ratio of their corresponding side lengths is constant, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Similarly, for rhombuses, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding diagonal lengths.

#### **Step 2: Determine the ratio of the diagonals**
The diagonal length of the blue rhombus is 8 yd, and the diagonal length of the green rhombus is 4 yd. Therefore, the ratio of the diagonals is:
\[
\text{Ratio of diagonals} = \frac{\text{Diagonal of green rhombus}}{\text{Diagonal of blue rhombus}} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

#### **Step 3: Use the property of similar figures**
Since the rhombuses are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding diagonal lengths. Thus:
\[
\text{Ratio of areas} = \left(\frac{\text{Diagonal of green rhombus}}{\text{Diagonal of blue rhombus}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
\]

#### **Step 4: Calculate the area of the green rhombus**
Let the area of the green rhombus be \( A_{\text{green}} \). The area of the blue rhombus is given as 36 yd². Using the ratio of the areas:
\[
\frac{A_{\text{green}}}{A_{\text{blue}}} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Substitute the given area of the blue rhombus:
\[
\frac{A_{\text{green}}}{36} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
Solve for \( A_{\text{green}} \):
\[
A_{\text{green}} = 36 \times \frac{1}{4} = 9 \text{ yd}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The area of the green rhombus is 9 yd². Comparing this with the given answer choices, we find that the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Final Answer: A
