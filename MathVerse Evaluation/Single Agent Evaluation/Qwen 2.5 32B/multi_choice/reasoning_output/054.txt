### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- We are given a geometric figure involving a ruler and a triangular plate.
- Angle 1 is explicitly labeled as \(40^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of angle 2.

#### **Step 2: Identify key relationships and properties**
- The triangular plate appears to have a right angle (90°) because it is part of a standard triangular plate used for drawing.
- The ruler is straight, so the line it forms is a straight line, which means the sum of angles on a straight line is \(180^\circ\).

#### **Step 3: Relate angle 1 to other angles**
- Angle 1 is part of a larger angle formed by the intersection of the ruler and the triangular plate.
- Since the triangular plate has a right angle (90°), we can deduce that the angle adjacent to angle 1 (on the same side of the ruler) is \(90^\circ - 40^\circ = 50^\circ\).

#### **Step 4: Use the straight-line property**
- The straight line formed by the ruler means that the sum of the angles on one side of the ruler must add up to \(180^\circ\).
- Therefore, angle 2 is supplementary to the angle adjacent to angle 1. Specifically, angle 2 is supplementary to the \(50^\circ\) angle we just calculated.
- Thus, angle 2 = \(180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ\).

#### **Step 5: Verify the calculations**
- We have correctly identified that the angle adjacent to angle 1 is \(50^\circ\) because it is part of the right angle of the triangular plate.
- Since angle 2 is supplementary to this \(50^\circ\) angle, our calculation of \(130^\circ\) is consistent with the properties of straight lines.

#### **Step 6: Match the answer to the choices**
- The calculated value of angle 2 is \(130^\circ\).
- Comparing this with the given answer choices:
  - A: \(130^\circ\)
  - B: \(140^\circ\)
  - C: \(120^\circ\)
  - D: \(125^\circ\)

The correct answer is \(130^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
