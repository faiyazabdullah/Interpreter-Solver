### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- Triangle $OAB$ is rotated clockwise around point $O$ by $30^\circ$ to form triangle $ODC$.
- Point $D$ lies on line segment $AB$.
- The measure of $\angle AOC = 100^\circ$.
- We need to find the measure of $\angle DOB$.

#### **Step 2: Analyze the rotation**
- When triangle $OAB$ is rotated clockwise by $30^\circ$, each point in triangle $OAB$ moves $30^\circ$ closer to the positive direction of the x-axis (if we imagine $OA$ as part of the x-axis).
- Specifically:
  - Point $A$ moves to point $D$.
  - Point $B$ moves to point $C$.
  - The rotation implies that $\angle AOD = 30^\circ$.

#### **Step 3: Use the given angle $\angle AOC = 100^\circ$**
- Since $\angle AOC = 100^\circ$, and $\angle AOD = 30^\circ$, we can find $\angle DOC$ by subtracting $\angle AOD$ from $\angle AOC$:
  $$
  \angle DOC = \angle AOC - \angle AOD = 100^\circ - 30^\circ = 70^\circ.
  $$

#### **Step 4: Determine $\angle DOB$**
- Note that $\angle DOB$ is the remaining angle between $\angle DOC$ and the rotation angle $\angle BOA = 30^\circ$. Since $D$ lies on $AB$, the total angle around point $O$ is $360^\circ$. However, we can directly use the fact that $\angle DOB$ is the difference between $\angle DOC$ and the rotation angle:
  $$
  \angle DOB = \angle DOC - \angle BOA = 70^\circ - 30^\circ = 40^\circ.
  $$

#### **Step 5: Verify the solution**
- The rotation by $30^\circ$ means that $\angle AOD = 30^\circ$ and $\angle DOC = 70^\circ$. Since $D$ is on $AB$, the angle $\angle DOB$ is simply the difference between $\angle DOC$ and the rotation angle, which is $40^\circ$.

#### **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{A}
$$
