### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a circle with several key features:
- **AB** and **DF** are congruent segments (denoted as \( AB \cong DF \)).
- **CE** is perpendicular to both **AB** and **DF**.
- **CB** is labeled as \( 9x \).
- **DE** is labeled as \( 2x + 14 \).

We are tasked with finding the value of \( x \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- Since \( CE \) is perpendicular to both \( AB \) and \( DF \), it acts as a common perpendicular bisector of these segments.
- This implies that \( CE \) divides both \( AB \) and \( DF \) into two equal parts. Therefore, \( CB \) and \( DE \) are corresponding halves of the segments \( AB \) and \( DF \), respectively.

#### **Step 2: Use the Congruence Property**
- Given that \( AB \cong DF \), the lengths of \( AB \) and \( DF \) are equal.
- Since \( CE \) is a perpendicular bisector, the segments \( CB \) and \( DE \) represent half the lengths of \( AB \) and \( DF \), respectively. Therefore, \( CB = DE \).

#### **Step 3: Set Up the Equation**
- From the problem, we know:
  \[
  CB = 9x
  \]
  \[
  DE = 2x + 14
  \]
- Since \( CB = DE \), we can set up the equation:
  \[
  9x = 2x + 14
  \]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
- Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
  \[
  9x - 2x = 14
  \]
  \[
  7x = 14
  \]
- Divide both sides by 7:
  \[
  x = 2
  \]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**
- If \( x = 2 \):
  \[
  CB = 9x = 9(2) = 18
  \]
  \[
  DE = 2x + 14 = 2(2) + 14 = 4 + 14 = 18
  \]
- Since \( CB = DE \), the solution is consistent with the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
