QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a parabola passing (0,2) and it opens upwards, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given graph and the question step by step:

### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a parabola that opens upwards and passes through the point \((0, 2)\). The parabola is symmetric about its vertical axis of symmetry, which appears to be the \(y\)-axis. This suggests the equation of the parabola could be of the form:
\[ y = ax^2 + bx + c \]
where \(a > 0\) (since the parabola opens upwards).

### Step 2: Understand the Question
We need to determine whether the given parabola has an **inverse function**. For a function to have an inverse, it must be **one-to-one**, meaning each \(y\)-value corresponds to exactly one \(x\)-value. This can be checked using the **Horizontal Line Test**: If any horizontal line intersects the graph at more than one point, the function is not one-to-one and does not have an inverse.

### Step 3: Apply the Horizontal Line Test
From the graph, observe that the parabola is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis. This means that for any positive \(x\)-value, there is a corresponding negative \(x\)-value that gives the same \(y\)-value. For example:
- If the point \((x, y)\) is on the parabola, then the point \((-x, y)\) is also on the parabola.
This indicates that the parabola fails the Horizontal Line Test, as a horizontal line drawn at any \(y\)-value above the vertex will intersect the parabola at two points.

### Step 4: Conclusion
Since the parabola is not one-to-one (it fails the Horizontal Line Test), it does not have an inverse function.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
