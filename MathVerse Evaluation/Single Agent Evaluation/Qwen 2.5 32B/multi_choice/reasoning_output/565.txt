### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the given information
- The function \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function, as indicated by its parabolic shape in the graph.
- Key points for \( g(x) \):
  - \( g(0) = -2 \)
  - \( g(-1) = 0 \)
  - \( g(2) = 0 \)
  - \( g(3) = 4 \)
  - \( g(-2) = 4 \)

From these points, we can deduce that the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 2 \), since these are the \( x \)-intercepts of the parabola.

#### Step 2: Determine the equation of \( g(x) \)
Since \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function and its roots are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 2 \), we can write:
\[ g(x) = a(x + 1)(x - 2) \]
where \( a \) is a constant. To find \( a \), we use the point \( g(0) = -2 \):
\[ g(0) = a(0 + 1)(0 - 2) = -2a \]
Given \( g(0) = -2 \):
\[ -2a = -2 \implies a = 1 \]
Thus, the equation for \( g(x) \) is:
\[ g(x) = (x + 1)(x - 2) = x^2 - x - 2 \]

#### Step 3: Examine the function \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is given as:
\[ f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 \]
To find the roots of \( f(x) \), we solve:
\[ x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \]
Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -6 \):
\[ x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4(1)(-6)}}{2(1)} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 24}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm 5}{2} \]
This gives:
\[ x = \frac{-1 + 5}{2} = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-1 - 5}{2} = -3 \]
So, the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -3 \).

#### Step 4: Compare the roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \)
- Roots of \( g(x) \): \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 2 \)
- Roots of \( f(x) \): \( x = 2 \) and \( x = -3 \)

The common root between \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) is \( x = 2 \). The other root of \( f(x) \) is \( x = -3 \), which is not a root of \( g(x) \). Similarly, the other root of \( g(x) \) is \( x = -1 \), which is not a root of \( f(x) \).

#### Step 5: Conclusion
The functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) share one root in common (\( x = 2 \)), but each has another root that is not shared (\( x = -3 \) for \( f(x) \) and \( x = -1 \) for \( g(x) \)).

### Final Answer:
