### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral.
- \( \angle A = 60^\circ \).
- The length of \( AB = 3 \).
- \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AC \).

#### **Step 2: Properties of an equilateral triangle**
An equilateral triangle has all sides equal and all internal angles equal to \( 60^\circ \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is equilateral:
- \( AB = BC = AC \).
- Given \( AB = 3 \), it follows that \( BC = 3 \) and \( AC = 3 \).

#### **Step 3: Use the midpoint \( D \)**
- \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), so \( AD = DC = \frac{AC}{2} \).
- Since \( AC = 3 \), we have:
  \[
  AD = DC = \frac{3}{2}.
  \]

#### **Step 4: Confirm the length of \( BC \)**
From the properties of an equilateral triangle, we already know that all sides are equal. Therefore:
\[
BC = AB = AC = 3.
\]

#### **Step 5: Check the answer choices**
The question asks for the length of \( BC \). Based on our calculations:
\[
BC = 3.
\]
However, none of the answer choices directly list \( 3 \). This suggests there might be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the problem setup. Let's recheck the problem statement and ensure no additional geometric relationships are overlooked.

Upon re-evaluating, the problem does not introduce any new geometric elements (such as additional segments or angles) that would alter the equilateral property. Therefore, the length of \( BC \) remains \( 3 \).

Since the answer choices do not include \( 3 \), and the problem involves an equilateral triangle, the closest reasonable interpretation is that the problem might be asking for a specific transformation or scaling. However, based on the given information, the length of \( BC \) is simply \( 3 \).

#### **Final Answer:**
Given the options, the closest match to our calculation is not directly listed. However, if we strictly follow the problem's setup and equilateral properties, the correct length of \( BC \) is \( 3 \). Since the options do not include \( 3 \), we must select the closest logical choice.
