QUESTION:
For function graphed below, which is a curve whose asymptote is x-axis and x=4, determine if it has an inverse function.

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given function graph step by step:

### Step 1: Examine the Graph
The graph shows a curve with the following characteristics:
- The curve approaches the **x-axis** as an asymptote for large values of \( |x| \). This means as \( x \to \pm\infty \), \( y \to 0 \).
- There is a vertical asymptote at \( x = 4 \). This indicates that the function is undefined at \( x = 4 \) and diverges (either positively or negatively) as \( x \) approaches 4.
- The curve is smooth and continuous everywhere except at \( x = 4 \).

### Step 2: Determine If the Function Has an Inverse
For a function to have an inverse, it must satisfy the **Horizontal Line Test**: No horizontal line can intersect the graph of the function more than once. This ensures that the function is one-to-one (injective).

#### Applying the Horizontal Line Test:
- Observe the graph: For any horizontal line drawn across the graph, it intersects the curve at most once. This is because the curve does not repeat any \( y \)-values.
- The vertical asymptote at \( x = 4 \) does not affect the Horizontal Line Test since the function is undefined at that point and does not produce any \( y \)-values there.

Since no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function is one-to-one.

### Step 3: Conclusion
Since the function passes the Horizontal Line Test, it has an inverse function.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
