### Analysis of the Problem:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle K \) in trapezoid \( J K L M \). The given information is as follows:
- \( J K \parallel M L \)
- \( J M = 6 \)
- \( K L = 6 \)
- \( \angle J M L = 80^\circ \)

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Properties
Since \( J K \parallel M L \), trapezoid \( J K L M \) is an isosceles trapezoid because the non-parallel sides \( J M \) and \( K L \) are equal (\( J M = K L = 6 \)). In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles formed by the legs and the bases are congruent.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Angles
- The given angle is \( \angle J M L = 80^\circ \).
- Since \( J M \) and \( K L \) are the legs of the isosceles trapezoid, the base angles \( \angle J M L \) and \( \angle K L M \) are congruent. Therefore, \( \angle K L M = 80^\circ \).

#### Step 3: Use the Property of Parallel Lines
Since \( J K \parallel M L \), the interior angles on the same side of the transversal are supplementary. Specifically:
- \( \angle J M L \) and \( \angle J M K \) are supplementary because they are interior angles on the same side of the transversal \( J M \).
- Similarly, \( \angle K L M \) and \( \angle K L J \) are supplementary because they are interior angles on the same side of the transversal \( K L \).

#### Step 4: Calculate \( \angle J M K \)
Since \( \angle J M L = 80^\circ \), the supplementary angle \( \angle J M K \) is:
\[
\angle J M K = 180^\circ - \angle J M L = 180^\circ - 80^\circ = 100^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Confirm \( \angle K \)
The angle \( \angle K \) in the trapezoid is \( \angle J M K \), which we have calculated to be \( 100^\circ \).

#### Step 6: Match with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( \angle K \) is \( 100^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 6
- B: 60
- C: 100
- D: 180

The correct answer is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
