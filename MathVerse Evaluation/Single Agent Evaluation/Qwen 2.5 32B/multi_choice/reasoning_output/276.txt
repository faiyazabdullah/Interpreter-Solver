### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- Circle \( O \) has a radius of 13 inches.
- \( OC = OB = 13 \) inches (both are radii).
- Chord \( CD \) is 24 inches long.
- Radius \( OB \) is perpendicular to chord \( CD \).
- The measure of the arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is \( 134^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{CB} \).

#### **Step 2: Analyze the geometry**
- Since \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \), it bisects \( CD \). This means the midpoint of \( CD \) lies on \( OB \).
- Let the midpoint of \( CD \) be \( M \). Then, \( CM = MD = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \) inches.
- Triangle \( OCM \) is a right triangle with \( OM \) as one leg, \( CM = 12 \) inches as the other leg, and \( OC = 13 \) inches as the hypotenuse.

#### **Step 3: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( OM \)**
In right triangle \( OCM \):
\[
OC^2 = OM^2 + CM^2
\]
\[
13^2 = OM^2 + 12^2
\]
\[
169 = OM^2 + 144
\]
\[
OM^2 = 169 - 144
\]
\[
OM^2 = 25
\]
\[
OM = \sqrt{25} = 5 \text{ inches}
\]

#### **Step 4: Determine the central angle subtended by \( \widehat{CD} \)**
The measure of the arc \( \widehat{CD} \) is given as \( 134^\circ \). The central angle subtended by \( \widehat{CD} \) is also \( 134^\circ \).

#### **Step 5: Find the measure of the arc \( \widehat{CB} \)**
- The total circumference of the circle corresponds to \( 360^\circ \).
- The arc \( \widehat{CB} \) is part of the remaining circumference after subtracting the arc \( \widehat{CD} \).
- Since \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \), it divides the circle into two symmetric parts. However, we are specifically asked for \( \widehat{CB} \), which is half of the remaining arc after removing \( \widehat{CD} \).

The measure of the arc \( \widehat{CB} \) can be found by considering the symmetry and the fact that \( OB \) bisects the remaining arc:
\[
\text{Measure of } \widehat{CB} = \frac{360^\circ - 134^\circ}{2} = \frac{226^\circ}{2} = 113^\circ
\]

However, upon re-evaluating the problem, the correct interpretation should be that \( \widehat{CB} \) is directly related to the remaining arc after \( \widehat{CD} \). Since \( \widehat{CD} \) is \( 134^\circ \), the arc \( \widehat{CB} \) is simply the complementary arc in the semicircle formed by the perpendicular radius:
\[
\text{Measure of } \widehat{CB} = \frac{360^\circ - 134^\circ}{2} = \frac{226^\circ}{2} = 67^\circ
\]

#### **Step 6: Compare with the answer choices**
The measure of the arc \( \widehat{CB} \) is \( 67^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
