### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**
- The figure shows a trapezoid \( RSTQ \) with parallel bases \( RS \) and \( QT \).
- \( AB \) is the median (or midsegment) of the trapezoid.
- \( RA = AQ \) and \( SB = BT \), meaning \( A \) and \( B \) are the midpoints of \( RQ \) and \( ST \), respectively.
- The lengths of the bases are given:
  - \( RS = 54 \)
  - \( QT = 86 \)

We need to find the length of the median \( AB \).

#### **Step 2: Recall the Median Formula for a Trapezoid**
The median (midsegment) of a trapezoid is the segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. The length of the median is the average of the lengths of the two parallel bases. Mathematically, the formula is:
\[
AB = \frac{RS + QT}{2}
\]

#### **Step 3: Substitute the Given Values into the Formula**
From the problem, we have:
- \( RS = 54 \)
- \( QT = 86 \)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
AB = \frac{RS + QT}{2} = \frac{54 + 86}{2}
\]

#### **Step 4: Perform the Calculation**
First, add the lengths of the bases:
\[
54 + 86 = 140
\]
Then, divide by 2:
\[
AB = \frac{140}{2} = 70
\]

#### **Step 5: Compare with the Answer Choices**
The calculated value of \( AB \) is 70. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 27
- B: 54
- C: 70
- D: 86

The correct answer is \( C \).

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
