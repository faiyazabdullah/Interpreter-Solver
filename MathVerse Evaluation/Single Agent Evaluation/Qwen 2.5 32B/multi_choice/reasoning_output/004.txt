### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- **AB** is tangent to circle \(O\) at point **B**.
- The extended line of **AO** intersects the circle at point **C**.
- \(\angle A = 36^\circ\).
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle C\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- **AB** is tangent to the circle at **B**, which means \(\angle OBA = 90^\circ\) (the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency).
- \(\angle A = 36^\circ\) is given.
- We need to find \(\angle C\).

#### **Step 2: Use properties of tangents and circles**
Since **AB** is tangent to the circle at **B**, we know:
- \(\angle OBA = 90^\circ\).
- In \(\triangle OBA\), the sum of the interior angles is \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
  \[
  \angle AOB + \angle OBA + \angle A = 180^\circ.
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  \angle AOB + 90^\circ + 36^\circ = 180^\circ.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  \angle AOB = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 36^\circ = 54^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 3: Use the inscribed angle theorem**
The angle \(\angle C\) is an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc as the central angle \(\angle AOB\). According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Therefore:
\[
\angle C = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOB.
\]
Substituting \(\angle AOB = 54^\circ\):
\[
\angle C = \frac{1}{2} \times 54^\circ = 27^\circ.
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the result**
- The central angle \(\angle AOB\) is \(54^\circ\).
- The inscribed angle \(\angle C\) subtends the same arc as \(\angle AOB\), so \(\angle C = \frac{1}{2} \times 54^\circ = 27^\circ\).
- This matches the properties of circles and the inscribed angle theorem.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
