### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a triangle with two internal angles labeled as \(27^\circ\) and \(52^\circ\). There is an external angle labeled as \(\angle 1\) adjacent to one of the internal angles of the triangle. We need to find the measure of \(\angle 1\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- The triangle has two internal angles: \(27^\circ\) and \(52^\circ\).
- The external angle \(\angle 1\) is formed by extending one side of the triangle.
- We need to find the measure of \(\angle 1\).

#### **Step 2: Use the property of the sum of internal angles in a triangle**
The sum of the internal angles in any triangle is always \(180^\circ\). Let the third internal angle of the triangle be \(x\). Then:
\[
27^\circ + 52^\circ + x = 180^\circ
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = 180^\circ - 27^\circ - 52^\circ = 101^\circ
\]
So, the third internal angle of the triangle is \(101^\circ\).

#### **Step 3: Use the relationship between an external angle and its adjacent internal angle**
The external angle \(\angle 1\) is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles of the triangle. In this case, the two non-adjacent internal angles are \(27^\circ\) and \(52^\circ\). Therefore:
\[
\angle 1 = 27^\circ + 52^\circ = 79^\circ
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the result**
The external angle \(\angle 1\) is indeed the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles, which confirms our calculation.

### Final Answer:
The measure of \(\angle 1\) is \(79^\circ\).
