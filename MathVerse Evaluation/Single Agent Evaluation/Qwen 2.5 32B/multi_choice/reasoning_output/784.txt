### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- Point \( O \) is the center of both circles.
- The circumference of the **large circle** is given as 36.
- The radius of the **small circle** is half the radius of the **large circle**.
- The angle subtended by the darkened arc at the center \( O \) is \( 80^\circ \).

We need to find the length of the darkened arc.

---

#### **Step 2: Use the formula for the circumference of a circle**
The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by:
\[
C = 2\pi r
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

For the **large circle**:
\[
2\pi R = 36
\]
where \( R \) is the radius of the large circle. Solving for \( R \):
\[
R = \frac{36}{2\pi} = \frac{18}{\pi}
\]

---

#### **Step 3: Determine the radius of the small circle**
The radius of the small circle is half the radius of the large circle:
\[
r = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{\frac{18}{\pi}}{2} = \frac{9}{\pi}
\]

---

#### **Step 4: Calculate the arc length formula**
The length of an arc subtended by an angle \( \theta \) (in degrees) at the center of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Arc length} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Here, the darkened arc is part of the **large circle**, so we use the radius \( R \) of the large circle. The angle \( \theta \) is \( 80^\circ \). Substituting \( R = \frac{18}{\pi} \) and \( \theta = 80^\circ \):
\[
\text{Arc length} = \frac{80^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi R
\]
\[
\text{Arc length} = \frac{80}{360} \times 2\pi \left(\frac{18}{\pi}\right)
\]

---

#### **Step 5: Simplify the expression**
First, simplify the fraction \( \frac{80}{360} \):
\[
\frac{80}{360} = \frac{2}{9}
\]
Now substitute back into the arc length formula:
\[
\text{Arc length} = \frac{2}{9} \times 2\pi \left(\frac{18}{\pi}\right)
\]
The \( \pi \) terms cancel out:
\[
\text{Arc length} = \frac{2}{9} \times 2 \times 18
\]
\[
\text{Arc length} = \frac{2}{9} \times 36
\]
\[
\text{Arc length} = 8
\]

---

#### **Step 6: Compare with the answer choices**
The length of the darkened arc is 8. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A. 10
- B. 8
- C. 6
- D. 4
- E. 2

The correct answer is \( B \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
