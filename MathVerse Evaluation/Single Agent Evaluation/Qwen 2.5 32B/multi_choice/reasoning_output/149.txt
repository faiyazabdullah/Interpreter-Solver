### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of the line segment $ED$ in the given geometric configuration. Here's the breakdown of the problem:

- **Given:**
  - $CD$ is a plane mirror.
  - Light is emitted from point $A$, reflects at point $E$ on $CD$, and reaches point $B$.
  - $AC \perpendicular CD$, $BD \perpendicular CD$.
  - $AC = 3.0$, $BD = 6.0$, $CD = 10.0$.
  - The incident angle is $\alpha$, but it is not directly needed for solving the problem.

- **Objective:**
  - Determine the length of $ED$.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Understanding the Reflection Law:**
   According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This means that if we reflect point $B$ across the mirror $CD$, the path $A \to E \to B$ will become a straight line from $A$ to the reflected point of $B$.

#### 2. **Reflecting Point $B$:**
   - Reflect point $B$ across the mirror $CD$ to get a new point $B'$. Since $BD \perpendicular CD$, the reflection of $B$ across $CD$ will have the same horizontal distance from $CD$ but will be below the mirror.
   - The coordinates of $B'$ can be determined as follows:
     - The vertical distance from $B$ to $CD$ is $BD = 6.0$.
     - Reflecting $B$ across $CD$, the vertical distance from $B'$ to $CD$ will also be $6.0$, but in the opposite direction.
     - Therefore, $B'$ is directly below $CD$ at a distance of $6.0$ units.

#### 3. **Coordinates of Points:**
   - Place the points on a coordinate system for clarity:
     - Let $C = (0, 0)$ and $D = (10, 0)$.
     - Since $AC \perpendicular CD$ and $AC = 3.0$, the coordinates of $A$ are $(0, 3)$.
     - Since $BD \perpendicular CD$ and $BD = 6.0$, the coordinates of $B$ are $(x_B, 6)$, where $x_B$ is unknown but lies on the line $CD$.
     - The reflected point $B'$ will have coordinates $(x_B, -6)$.

#### 4. **Path $A \to E \to B$:**
   - After reflecting $B$ to $B'$, the path $A \to E \to B$ becomes a straight line $A \to B'$.
   - The coordinates of $A$ are $(0, 3)$, and the coordinates of $B'$ are $(x_B, -6)$.
   - The equation of the straight line $AB'$ can be determined using the slope formula:
     \[
     \text{slope of } AB' = \frac{-6 - 3}{x_B - 0} = \frac{-9}{x_B}.
     \]
   - The equation of the line $AB'$ is:
     \[
     y - 3 = \frac{-9}{x_B} x \implies y = \frac{-9}{x_B} x + 3.
     \]

#### 5. **Finding the Intersection Point $E$:**
   - Point $E$ is the intersection of the line $AB'$ with the mirror $CD$. Since $CD$ is the x-axis ($y = 0$), substitute $y = 0$ into the equation of $AB'$:
     \[
     0 = \frac{-9}{x_B} x + 3 \implies \frac{-9}{x_B} x = -3 \implies x = \frac{3x_B}{9} = \frac{x_B}{3}.
     \]
   - Therefore, the coordinates of $E$ are $\left( \frac{x_B}{3}, 0 \right)$.

#### 6. **Using the Distance Formula:**
   - The total horizontal distance from $C$ to $D$ is $10$. Since $E$ lies on $CD$, the horizontal distance from $C$ to $E$ is $\frac{x_B}{3}$, and the horizontal distance from $E$ to $D$ is $10 - \frac{x_B}{3}$.
   - By the properties of similar triangles or the reflection law, the ratio of the distances $AC$ and $BD$ is equal to the ratio of the segments $CE$ and $ED$:
     \[
     \frac{AC}{BD} = \frac{CE}{ED} \implies \frac{3}{6} = \frac{\frac{x_B}{3}}{10 - \frac{x_B}{3}}.
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\frac{x_B}{3}}{10 - \frac{x_B}{3}} \implies \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x_B}{30 - x_B}.
     \]
   - Cross-multiply:
     \[
     30 - x_B = 2x_B \implies 30 = 3x_B \implies x_B = 10.
     \]
   - Therefore, the length of $ED$ is:
     \[
     ED = 10 - \frac{x_B}{3} = 10 - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3}.
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
