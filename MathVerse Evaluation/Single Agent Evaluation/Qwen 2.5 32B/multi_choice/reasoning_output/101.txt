### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given a circle with center \( O \), where \( AB \) is the diameter. Points \( C \) and \( D \) lie on the circle. We are also given that \( \angle AOC = 126^\circ \). We need to find the measure of \( \angle CDB \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry
- Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle, it subtends a right angle at any point on the circumference. This means \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle AOC \) is a central angle, and its measure is given as \( 126^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle CDB \) is an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc \( CD \) as the central angle \( \angle COD \).

#### Step 2: Relating Central and Inscribed Angles
- The key property we use here is that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
- First, we need to find the measure of the central angle \( \angle COD \). Since \( \angle AOC = 126^\circ \), the remaining part of the circle (the arc \( CD \)) can be found by subtracting \( \angle AOC \) from \( 360^\circ \):
  \[
  \angle COD = 360^\circ - \angle AOC = 360^\circ - 126^\circ = 234^\circ.
  \]
- However, we need to focus on the arc \( CD \) that is directly subtended by \( \angle CDB \). The arc \( CD \) is actually the minor arc, which is the part of the circle that does not include the \( 126^\circ \) central angle. Therefore, the measure of the minor arc \( CD \) is:
  \[
  \text{Measure of minor arc } CD = 360^\circ - 126^\circ = 234^\circ - 180^\circ = 134^\circ.
  \]
- But we need to re-evaluate the direct relationship. The inscribed angle \( \angle CDB \) subtends the arc \( CD \) that is directly related to the central angle \( \angle COD \) for the minor arc. The correct approach is to use the fact that the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Since \( \angle AOC = 126^\circ \), the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) that subtends the arc \( AB \) is not needed here. Instead, we focus on the arc \( CD \) which is part of the circle not directly given but can be inferred from the symmetry and properties of the circle.

#### Step 3: Calculating \( \angle CDB \)
- The inscribed angle \( \angle CDB \) subtends the arc \( CD \), and the measure of this arc is the part of the circle that is not directly given but can be inferred. The correct approach is to use the fact that the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Since \( \angle AOC = 126^\circ \), the inscribed angle \( \angle CDB \) that subtends the arc \( CD \) is:
  \[
  \angle CDB = \frac{1}{2} \times (180^\circ - 126^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} \times 54^\circ = 27^\circ.
  \]

#### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle CDB \) is \( 27^\circ \).
