To solve the problem, we need to determine how many solutions the equation \( x^3 - x^2 - x = -2 \) has. Let's analyze the given graph of \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The equation \( x^3 - x^2 - x = -2 \) can be rewritten as:
\[ x^3 - x^2 - x + 2 = 0. \]
This is equivalent to finding the points where the graph of \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) intersects the horizontal line \( y = -2 \).

### Step 2: Examine the Graph
From the graph, we observe the following:
- The function \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) is a cubic polynomial.
- The graph crosses the \( x \)-axis at \( x = -1 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( x = 1 \).
- The graph has a local maximum and a local minimum, which are key features of a cubic polynomial.

### Step 3: Determine the Intersection Points
We need to find how many times the graph of \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) intersects the line \( y = -2 \). To do this, we look at the behavior of the function:
1. As \( x \to -\infty \), \( y \to -\infty \).
2. As \( x \to \infty \), \( y \to \infty \).
3. The function has a local maximum and a local minimum, so it can intersect a horizontal line multiple times depending on the position of the line.

From the graph, we can see that the line \( y = -2 \) intersects the graph of \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) at three distinct points. This is because:
- The graph starts from negative infinity, rises to a local maximum, falls to a local minimum, and then rises again to positive infinity.
- The line \( y = -2 \) cuts through the graph at three distinct points, as can be visually confirmed.

### Step 4: Count the Solutions
Since the graph intersects the line \( y = -2 \) at three distinct points, the equation \( x^3 - x^2 - x = -2 \) has three solutions.
