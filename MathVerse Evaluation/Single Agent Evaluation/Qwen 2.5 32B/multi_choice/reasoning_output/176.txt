To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use the provided information step by step. Let's proceed with the solution:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- We have a circle with center \( A \).
- Chord \( BC = 8 \).
- Chord \( DE = 6 \).
- The angles \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle EAD \) are supplementary, i.e., \( \angle BAC + \angle EAD = 180^\circ \).

### Step 2: Interpret the supplementary angles
The condition \( \angle BAC + \angle EAD = 180^\circ \) implies that the arcs \( BC \) and \( DE \) are opposite each other in the circle. This means that the perpendiculars from the center \( A \) to the chords \( BC \) and \( DE \) will intersect the chords at their midpoints, and these perpendiculars will form a straight line.

### Step 3: Use the properties of chords and perpendiculars
When a perpendicular is drawn from the center of a circle to a chord, it bisects the chord. Therefore:
- The perpendicular from \( A \) to \( BC \) bisects \( BC \) into two equal segments of length \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).
- The perpendicular from \( A \) to \( DE \) bisects \( DE \) into two equal segments of length \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \).

Let \( M \) be the midpoint of \( BC \) and \( N \) be the midpoint of \( DE \). Then:
- \( AM \) is the perpendicular distance from \( A \) to \( BC \), and \( BM = CM = 4 \).
- \( AN \) is the perpendicular distance from \( A \) to \( DE \), and \( DN = EN = 3 \).

### Step 4: Use the Pythagorean theorem
In the right triangles \( ABM \) and \( ADN \):
- For \( \triangle ABM \): \( AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \).
- For \( \triangle ADN \): \( AD^2 = AN^2 + DN^2 \).

Since \( AB = AD = r \) (the radius of the circle), we can write:
\[ r^2 = AM^2 + 4^2 \]
\[ r^2 = AN^2 + 3^2 \]

### Step 5: Relate \( AM \) and \( AN \)
Since \( \angle BAC + \angle EAD = 180^\circ \), the points \( M \) and \( N \) lie on a straight line passing through the center \( A \). Let the distance from \( A \) to \( M \) be \( x \) and the distance from \( A \) to \( N \) be \( y \). Then:
\[ AM = x \]
\[ AN = y \]
and \( x + y \) is the distance between the midpoints of the chords, which is part of the diameter of the circle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles:
\[ r^2 = x^2 + 4^2 \]
\[ r^2 = y^2 + 3^2 \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( r \)
Since \( x \) and \( y \) are distances along the same line through the center, and the total length of the diameter is \( 2r \), we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the半径减去垂直距离的平方等于半弦长的平方。 Specifically, we can use the relationship:
\[ r^2 = x^2 + 16 \]
\[ r^2 = y^2 + 9 \]

By the property of the circle, the sum of the squares of the perpendicular distances from the center to the chords, when added to the squares of half the chord lengths, must equal the square of the radius. Solving these equations simultaneously, we find:
\[ r = 5 \]

### Final Answer:
The radius of the circle is \( 5 \).
