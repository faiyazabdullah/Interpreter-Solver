QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Analyze the given information
The problem involves a straight line \( AB \) with point \( O \) lying on it. Four angles are formed around point \( O \), and their measures are given as fractions of \( x \):
- \( \frac{x}{6} \)
- \( \frac{x}{4} \)
- \( \frac{x}{3} \)
- \( \frac{x}{2} \)

Since these angles are formed around a single point \( O \) on a straight line, they must add up to \( 360^\circ \). This is because the sum of all angles around a point is always \( 360^\circ \).

### Step 2: Set up the equation
We can write the equation for the sum of the angles:
\[
\frac{x}{6} + \frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{2} = 360
\]

### Step 3: Find a common denominator
To simplify the equation, we need a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 6, 4, 3, and 2. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers is 12. We rewrite each fraction with a denominator of 12:
\[
\frac{x}{6} = \frac{2x}{12}, \quad \frac{x}{4} = \frac{3x}{12}, \quad \frac{x}{3} = \frac{4x}{12}, \quad \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6x}{12}
\]

### Step 4: Combine the fractions
Substitute these into the equation:
\[
\frac{2x}{12} + \frac{3x}{12} + \frac{4x}{12} + \frac{6x}{12} = 360
\]
Combine the numerators over the common denominator:
\[
\frac{2x + 3x + 4x + 6x}{12} = 360
\]
Simplify the numerator:
\[
\frac{15x}{12} = 360
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( x \)
Multiply both sides of the equation by 12 to eliminate the denominator:
\[
15x = 360 \times 12
\]
\[
15x = 4320
\]
Divide both sides by 15:
\[
x = \frac{4320}{15}
\]
\[
x = 288
\]

### Step 6: Verify the answer
The value of \( x \) is 288. However, this does not match any of the given answer choices. Let us recheck the problem and ensure no mistakes were made. Upon rechecking, it appears there might be a misinterpretation or a different approach needed. Let us consider the possibility of a simpler interpretation where the angles might be part of a linear pair or supplementary angles.

Revisiting the problem, the angles might be part of a linear pair, meaning they could add up to \( 180^\circ \) instead of \( 360^\circ \). Let us solve under this assumption:
\[
\frac{x}{6} + \frac{x}{4} + \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{2} = 180
\]
Using the same steps as before:
\[
\frac{2x}{12} + \frac{3x}{12} + \frac{4x}{12} + \frac{6x}{12} = 180
\]
\[
\frac{15x}{12} = 180
\]
\[
15x = 180 \times 12
\]
\[
15x = 2160
\]
\[
x = \frac{2160}{15}
\]
\[
x = 144
\]

### Step 7: Compare with the answer choices
The value of \( x \) is 144, which matches one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
