### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves a circle with a diameter \( AB \). Points \( A \) and \( B \) are endpoints of the diameter, and point \( C \) lies on the circumference of the circle. The lengths \( AC = 8 \) inches and \( BC = 15 \) inches are given. We need to find the radius of the circle.

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle, \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle).
- Therefore, \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( AB \) as the hypotenuse.

#### Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem
In \( \triangle ABC \):
- \( AC = 8 \) inches
- \( BC = 15 \) inches
- \( AB \) is the hypotenuse.

By the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
AB^2 = 8^2 + 15^2
\]
\[
AB^2 = 64 + 225
\]
\[
AB^2 = 289
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
AB = \sqrt{289} = 17
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the Radius
The diameter \( AB \) is 17 inches. The radius \( r \) of the circle is half of the diameter:
\[
r = \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{17}{2} = 8.5
\]

#### Step 4: Select the Correct Answer
The radius of the circle is \( 8.5 \) inches. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 7.5
- B: 8
- C: 8.5
- D: 17

The correct answer is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
