### Problem Analysis:
The image shows a right triangle formed by the following components:
1. **Angle A**: The angle at which the driver glances up at the top of the building.
2. **Opposite Side**: The vertical height of the building (labeled as the grid pattern).
3. **Adjacent Side**: The horizontal distance from the driver to the base of the building.
4. **Hypotenuse**: The straight line connecting the driver's eye level to the top of the building.

The question asks whether the distance from the driver to the building (the horizontal distance) corresponds to the **opposite side** of the triangle relative to angle A.

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify the Components of the Triangle**:
   - **Angle A**: The angle formed between the ground (horizontal) and the line of sight (hypotenuse).
   - **Opposite Side**: The side opposite to angle A, which is the vertical height of the building.
   - **Adjacent Side**: The side adjacent to angle A, which is the horizontal distance from the driver to the building.
   - **Hypotenuse**: The longest side of the triangle, connecting the driver's eye level to the top of the building.

2. **Understand the Definitions**:
   - In trigonometry, the **opposite side** of an angle in a right triangle is the side that does not form part of the angle but lies directly across from it.
   - The **adjacent side** is the side that forms one leg of the angle and is next to the vertex of the angle.
   - The **hypotenuse** is the side opposite the right angle and is the longest side.

3. **Apply Trigonometric Relationships**:
   - For angle A:
     - The **opposite side** is the vertical height of the building.
     - The **adjacent side** is the horizontal distance from the driver to the building.
     - The **hypotenuse** is the line of sight from the driver to the top of the building.

4. **Analyze the Question**:
   - The question states that the distance from the driver to the building (the horizontal distance) is the **opposite side**.
   - However, based on the definitions above, the horizontal distance is actually the **adjacent side**, not the **opposite side**.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The statement is incorrect because the distance from the driver to the building is the **adjacent side**, not the **opposite side**.

### Final Answer:
