====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric configuration and use relevant properties of triangles and medians.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) has midpoints \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \) on sides \( AC \), \( AB \), and \( CB \), respectively.
- The medians \( AT \), \( BR \), and \( CS \) intersect at the centroid \( M \).
- We are given:
  - \( MC = 7 \)
  - \( RM = 4 \)
  - \( AT = 16 \)
- We need to find \( MB \).

### Step 2: Properties of the Centroid
The centroid \( M \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of \( 2:1 \), where the segment closer to the vertex is twice as long as the segment closer to the midpoint of the opposite side.

#### Key Property:
- If \( M \) is the centroid, then:
  - \( AM : MT = 2 : 1 \)
  - \( BM : MR = 2 : 1 \)
  - \( CM : MS = 2 : 1 \)

### Step 3: Use the Given Information
#### (a) Analyze \( MC = 7 \)
Since \( M \) is the centroid, it divides the median \( CS \) in the ratio \( 2:1 \). Therefore:
\[ CM : MS = 2 : 1 \]
Given \( MC = 7 \), we can find \( MS \):
\[ MS = \frac{1}{2} \cdot MC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 7 = 3.5 \]

#### (b) Analyze \( RM = 4 \)
Similarly, since \( M \) is the centroid, it divides the median \( BR \) in the ratio \( 2:1 \). Therefore:
\[ BM : MR = 2 : 1 \]
Given \( RM = 4 \), we can find \( BM \):
\[ BM = 2 \cdot RM = 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \]

### Step 4: Verify Consistency
We have determined \( MB = 8 \). Let us verify the consistency with the other given information:
- \( AT = 16 \): Since \( M \) divides \( AT \) in the ratio \( 2:1 \):
  \[ AM : MT = 2 : 1 \]
  \[ AM = \frac{2}{3} \cdot AT = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 16 = \frac{32}{3} \]
  \[ MT = \frac{1}{3} \cdot AT = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 16 = \frac{16}{3} \]
This is consistent with the properties of the centroid.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The value of \( MB \) is \( 8 \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
