### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows an ellipse centered near the point \((-2, 1)\). The ellipse is oriented such that its major axis is vertical, and its minor axis is horizontal. The domain (horizontal extent) of the ellipse is from \(x = -3\) to \(x = -1\), and the range (vertical extent) is from \(y = -1\) to \(y = 3\).

#### Step 2: Understand the Question
We need to determine whether the relation described by the ellipse is a **one-to-one function**. A one-to-one function satisfies the property that each \(x\)-value corresponds to exactly one \(y\)-value, and no two different \(x\)-values map to the same \(y\)-value.

#### Step 3: Identify Key Properties of the Ellipse
- An ellipse is a closed curve where every point on the curve is equidistant from two fixed points (the foci). 
- For any vertical line drawn through the ellipse, it will intersect the ellipse at most twice. This means that for some \(x\)-values, there can be multiple corresponding \(y\)-values.
- The vertical extent (range) of the ellipse is from \(y = -1\) to \(y = 3\), and the horizontal extent (domain) is from \(x = -3\) to \(x = -1\).

#### Step 4: Apply the Horizontal Line Test
To determine if the relation is a one-to-one function, we use the **horizontal line test**:
- If any horizontal line intersects the graph of the relation at more than one point, the relation is **not a one-to-one function**.
- If every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once, the relation is a one-to-one function.

From the image, we observe that the ellipse is symmetric about its center and extends vertically from \(y = -1\) to \(y = 3\). Any horizontal line drawn within this range (e.g., \(y = 0\)) will intersect the ellipse at two distinct points. This indicates that there are multiple \(x\)-values corresponding to the same \(y\)-value.

#### Step 5: Conclusion
Since the ellipse fails the horizontal line test (multiple intersections for some horizontal lines), the relation is **not a one-to-one function**.
