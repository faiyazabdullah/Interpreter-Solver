To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometric relationships in the figure and use the given measurements to find the length of the ladder \( AB \).

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The foot of the ladder \( B \) is 1.6 units away from the wall.
- The point \( D \) on the ladder is 1.4 units away from the wall.
- The length of \( BD \) is 0.55 units.
- We need to find the total length of the ladder \( AB \).

### Step 2: Define variables and set up the problem
Let:
- \( BC = 1.6 \) (distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall).
- \( DE = 1.4 \) (distance from point \( D \) to the wall).
- \( BD = 0.55 \) (length of segment \( BD \)).
- \( AE = x \) (height of the ladder from the ground to the point where it touches the wall).
- \( AD = y \) (length of the segment \( AD \)).

Since \( AB = AD + DB \), we need to find \( AD \) and add \( BD \) to it.

### Step 3: Use similar triangles
The triangles \( \triangle AEC \) and \( \triangle DEC \) are similar because they share the same angle at \( C \) and both have right angles at \( E \) and \( D \), respectively. Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{AE}{DE} = \frac{AC}{DC}
\]
Here:
- \( AE = x \)
- \( DE = 1.4 \)
- \( AC = BC = 1.6 \)
- \( DC = BC - BD = 1.6 - 0.55 = 1.05 \)

Thus, the similarity ratio gives:
\[
\frac{x}{1.4} = \frac{1.6}{1.05}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
First, calculate the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
\frac{1.6}{1.05} \approx 1.5238
\]
So:
\[
\frac{x}{1.4} = 1.5238
\]
Multiply both sides by 1.4:
\[
x = 1.5238 \times 1.4 \approx 2.1333
\]

### Step 5: Use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AEC \)
In \( \triangle AEC \):
\[
AC^2 + EC^2 = AE^2
\]
We know:
- \( AC = 1.6 \)
- \( EC = 1.6 \) (since \( E \) is directly below \( A \) and \( C \) is directly below \( B \))
- \( AE = x \approx 2.1333 \)

However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle AEC \) to verify:
\[
AB = \sqrt{AE^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{(2.1333)^2 + (1.6)^2}
\]
Calculate each term:
\[
(2.1333)^2 \approx 4.5511
\]
\[
(1.6)^2 = 2.56
\]
\[
AB = \sqrt{4.5511 + 2.56} = \sqrt{7.1111} \approx 2.6666
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total length of the ladder
The total length of the ladder \( AB \) is the sum of \( AD \) and \( DB \):
\[
AD = \sqrt{x^2 + (BC - BD)^2} = \sqrt{(2.1333)^2 + (1.05)^2}
\]
\[
AD = \sqrt{4.5511 + 1.1025} = \sqrt{5.6536} \approx 2.3777
\]
\[
AB = AD + DB = 2.3777 + 0.55 \approx 2.9277
\]

### Step 7: Verify and select the closest answer
The closest answer to our calculated value is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
