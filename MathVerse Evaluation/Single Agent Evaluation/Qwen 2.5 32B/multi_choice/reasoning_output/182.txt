### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the maximum value of the distance from point \( O \) to vertex \( A \) in a right triangle \( ABC \), where:
- \( \angle XOY = 45^\circ \)
- \( AB = 10 \)
- \( A \) moves along \( OX \) and \( B \) moves along \( OY \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
- The right triangle \( ABC \) has \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the lines \( OX \) and \( OY \), respectively.
- The hypotenuse \( AB = 10 \).
- The angle \( \angle XOY = 45^\circ \) implies that \( OX \) and \( OY \) form a 45-degree angle.

#### **Step 2: Coordinate System Setup**
To simplify the problem, we place the origin \( O \) at the point \((0, 0)\):
- Let \( A \) have coordinates \((x, 0)\) since it lies on \( OX \).
- Let \( B \) have coordinates \((0, y)\) since it lies on \( OY \).

#### **Step 3: Use the Distance Formula for \( AB \)**
The distance between points \( A(x, 0) \) and \( B(0, y) \) is given by:
\[
AB = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (0 - y)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \( AB = 10 \), we have:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 10 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 100
\]

#### **Step 4: Use the Angle Constraint**
The angle \( \angle XOY = 45^\circ \) implies that the slope of the line \( AB \) forms a specific relationship with the axes. However, a more direct approach is to use the fact that the distance from \( O \) to \( A \) is simply \( OA = x \).

#### **Step 5: Maximize \( OA \)**
We need to maximize the distance \( OA = x \). From the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \), we see that \( x \) and \( y \) are constrained by this circle. To maximize \( x \), we minimize \( y \).

Using the Pythagorean identity:
\[
y^2 = 100 - x^2
\]
The distance \( OA = x \) is maximized when \( y = 0 \). However, since \( A \) and \( B \) form a right triangle, \( y \neq 0 \). Instead, we use the fact that the maximum value of \( x \) occurs when \( x \) and \( y \) are proportional to the sides of a 45-45-90 triangle.

In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal. Thus, \( x = y \). Substituting \( x = y \) into \( x^2 + y^2 = 100 \):
\[
x^2 + x^2 = 100 \implies 2x^2 = 100 \implies x^2 = 50 \implies x = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

However, this is the length of each leg in the 45-45-90 triangle formed by \( AB \). To find the maximum \( OA \), we consider the projection of \( AB \) onto \( OX \).

#### **Step 6: Project \( AB \) onto \( OX \)**
The maximum distance \( OA \) occurs when \( AB \) is aligned such that \( A \) is as far as possible from \( O \). Using trigonometry, the maximum \( OA \) is:
\[
OA = AB \cdot \cos(45^\circ) = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}
\]

However, this is incorrect because we need to consider the full length of \( AB \) projected onto \( OX \). The correct approach is to recognize that the maximum \( OA \) is achieved when \( AB \) is fully extended along the direction of \( OX \), giving:
\[
OA = 10\sqrt{2}
\]

#### **Step 7: Verify and Conclude**
The maximum value of \( OA \) is indeed \( 10\sqrt{2} \), as this is the longest possible distance from \( O \) to \( A \) while maintaining the right triangle condition and the given constraints.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
