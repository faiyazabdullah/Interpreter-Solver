### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure involving two vertical telephone poles $AB$ and $CD$, where:
- $AB = 6.0$
- $CD = 3.0$
- The lines $AD$ and $BC$ intersect at point $E$.
- We need to find the length of the perpendicular distance from $E$ to the ground, which is $EF$.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Identify Key Elements and Relationships:**
   - $AB$ and $CD$ are vertical poles.
   - $AD$ and $BC$ are straight lines that intersect at point $E$.
   - $EF$ is the perpendicular distance from $E$ to the ground (line $BD$).

#### 2. **Use Similar Triangles:**
   - Since $AB \parallel CD$, triangles $ABE$ and $CDE$ are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. This is because:
     - $\angle AEB = \angle CED$ (vertical angles).
     - $\angle BAE = \angle DCE$ (alternate interior angles since $AB \parallel CD$).

   From the similarity of triangles $ABE$ and $CDE$, we have:
   $$
   \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BE}{DE}.
   $$
   Substituting the given values:
   $$
   \frac{6}{3} = \frac{BE}{DE} \implies \frac{2}{1} = \frac{BE}{DE}.
   $$
   This implies:
   $$
   BE = 2 \cdot DE.
   $$

#### 3. **Express Coordinates and Use Proportions:**
   - Let the height of point $E$ above the ground be $h$. Then, the length $EF = h$.
   - Since $AB = 6$ and $CD = 3$, the total height difference between $AB$ and $CD$ is $6 - 3 = 3$.
   - The ratio of the heights of the segments $BE$ and $DE$ is the same as the ratio of the segments $AE$ and $CE$ in the vertical direction. This means the height $h$ of $E$ divides the total height difference proportionally.

   Using the similarity ratio:
   $$
   \frac{h}{6} = \frac{3 - h}{3}.
   $$
   Cross-multiplying gives:
   $$
   3h = 6(3 - h) \implies 3h = 18 - 6h \implies 9h = 18 \implies h = 2.
   $$

#### 4. **Conclusion:**
   - The height $h$ of point $E$ above the ground is $2$. Therefore, the length of $EF$ is $2$.

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{A}
$$
