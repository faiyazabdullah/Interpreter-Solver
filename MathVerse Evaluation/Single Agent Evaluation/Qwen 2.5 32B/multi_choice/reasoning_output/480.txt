QUESTION:
There are 4 labels on the x-axis $-\pi$, $-\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\pi$ and a curve that goes through ($\frac{2}{\pi}$,0). Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A:This is a one-to-one function
B:This is not a one-to-one function

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining whether the given curve represents a **one-to-one function**. To do this, we need to analyze the graph and apply the **Horizontal Line Test**. A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once.

#### Step 1: Examine the Graph
- The graph shows a curve that extends from left to right.
- Key points on the x-axis are labeled as $-\pi$, $-\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\frac{2}{\pi}$, and $\pi$.
- The curve passes through the point $(\frac{2}{\pi}, 0)$.
- The curve appears to be smooth and continuous, but we need to check for any horizontal lines intersecting it more than once.

#### Step 2: Apply the Horizontal Line Test
The Horizontal Line Test states that a function is one-to-one if no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once. Let's analyze the graph:

1. **Behavior of the Curve**:
   - From the graph, observe the curve's shape:
     - As $x$ increases from $-\pi$ to $\frac{2}{\pi}$, the curve decreases monotonically.
     - At $x = \frac{2}{\pi}$, the curve reaches a local minimum (or touches the x-axis).
     - After $x = \frac{2}{\pi}$, the curve begins to increase again.

2. **Check for Multiple Intersections**:
   - Draw imaginary horizontal lines across the graph:
     - For any horizontal line above or below the x-axis, it intersects the curve at most once.
     - At the x-axis ($y = 0$), the curve intersects only at $x = \frac{2}{\pi}$.
     - There are no horizontal lines that intersect the curve more than once.

#### Step 3: Conclusion
Since no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, the function satisfies the Horizontal Line Test. Therefore, the function is one-to-one.
