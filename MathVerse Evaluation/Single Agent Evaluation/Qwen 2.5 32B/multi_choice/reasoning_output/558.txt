QUESTION:

CHOICES:

B:-5 \leq x \leq 4
C:-5 \leq x \leq 5
D:-5 \leq x \leq 6

To solve the problem, let's follow the steps outlined:

### Step 1: Examine the geometric figure and identify the given information.
The image shows a piecewise function \( h(x) \) plotted on a coordinate plane. The function passes through the following points:
- \( (-5, 4) \)
- \( (0, 7) \)
- \( (3, 7) \)
- \( (3, 1) \)
- \( (5, -5) \)

### Step 2: Understand the measurements and relationships shown.
The function \( h(x) \) is piecewise, meaning it consists of different linear segments over different intervals of \( x \). The key points provided define the boundaries of these intervals.

### Step 3: Identify what needs to be found.
We need to determine the **domain** of the function \( h(x) \). The domain is the set of all possible \( x \)-values for which the function is defined.

### Step 4: Apply relevant geometric theorems, properties, and formulas.
The domain of a function is determined by the range of \( x \)-values over which the function is defined. From the given points:
- The smallest \( x \)-value is \( -5 \).
- The largest \( x \)-value is \( 5 \).

Since the function is continuous between these points (as indicated by the graph), the domain of \( h(x) \) is the interval from the smallest \( x \)-value to the largest \( x \)-value.

### Step 5: Show all your calculations clearly.
The \( x \)-values of the points are:
- \( -5 \)
- \( 0 \)
- \( 3 \)
- \( 5 \)

The smallest \( x \)-value is \( -5 \), and the largest \( x \)-value is \( 5 \). Therefore, the domain of \( h(x) \) is:
\[ -5 \leq x \leq 5 \]

### Step 6: Compare your calculated result with the given answer choices.
The domain \( -5 \leq x \leq 5 \) matches choice C.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
