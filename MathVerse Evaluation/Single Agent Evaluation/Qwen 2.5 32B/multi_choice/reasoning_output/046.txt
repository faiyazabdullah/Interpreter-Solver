### Analysis and Solution:

#### Step 1: Examine the given information
- The figure shows two parallel lines: \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- There is a transversal line intersecting both \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- The angle \( \angle A \) is given as \( 70^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

#### Step 2: Understand the relationships
Since \( AB \parallel CD \), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals:
- Corresponding angles are equal.
- Alternate interior angles are equal.
- Consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 3: Identify the relationship between \( \angle A \) and \( \angle 1 \)
- The angle \( \angle A \) is an alternate interior angle to the angle formed by the transversal and line \( CD \) at point \( C \). However, \( \angle 1 \) is the exterior angle adjacent to this alternate interior angle.
- Specifically, \( \angle 1 \) is the supplement of the angle that corresponds to \( \angle A \) because it forms a linear pair with the alternate interior angle.

#### Step 4: Apply the properties
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the angle corresponding to \( \angle A \) on line \( CD \) is also \( 70^\circ \).
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is the supplement of this \( 70^\circ \) angle because it forms a linear pair with it.
- Therefore, \( \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ \).

#### Step 5: Verify the calculation
- The angle \( \angle 1 \) is indeed the supplement of the angle corresponding to \( \angle A \) due to the linear pair property.
- This confirms that \( \angle 1 = 110^\circ \).

#### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 110^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \( 20^\circ \)
- B: \( 30^\circ \)
- C: \( 70^\circ \)
- D: \( 110^\circ \)

The correct answer is \( D \).

### Final Answer:
