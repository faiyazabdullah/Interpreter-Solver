QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

Who is traveling faster?

CHOICES:
A:Justin
B:Oliver

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the solution steps systematically:

### Step 1: Examine the Graph
The graph shows two linear functions representing the progress of two competitors, Oliver and Justin, in a cycling race. 
- The **x-axis** represents **Time** (in units, likely hours).
- The **y-axis** represents **Distance** (in units, likely kilometers).

### Step 2: Understand the Relationships
The slope of each line represents the speed of the competitor. Speed is defined as the rate of change of distance with respect to time, i.e., the slope of the line:
\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\Delta \text{Distance}}{\Delta \text{Time}}
\]
The steeper the line, the faster the competitor is traveling.

### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine which competitor is traveling faster. This requires comparing the slopes of the two lines.

### Step 4: Analyze the Slopes
#### Oliver's Line:
- Oliver's line passes through the points approximately:
  - At \( t = 0 \), \( d = 0 \) (origin).
  - At \( t = 5 \), \( d = 175 \).
- The slope of Oliver's line can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Slope of Oliver} = \frac{\Delta \text{Distance}}{\Delta \text{Time}} = \frac{175 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{175}{5} = 35
  \]

#### Justin's Line:
- Justin's line passes through the points approximately:
  - At \( t = 1 \), \( d = 25 \).
  - At \( t = 5 \), \( d = 125 \).
- The slope of Justin's line can be calculated as:
  \[
  \text{Slope of Justin} = \frac{\Delta \text{Distance}}{\Delta \text{Time}} = \frac{125 - 25}{5 - 1} = \frac{100}{4} = 25
  \]

### Step 5: Compare the Slopes
- Oliver's slope: \( 35 \)
- Justin's slope: \( 25 \)

Since the slope represents speed, Oliver's speed is higher than Justin's speed.

### Step 6: Match the Result with Answer Choices
From the calculations:
- Oliver is traveling faster because his slope (speed) is greater than Justin's.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
