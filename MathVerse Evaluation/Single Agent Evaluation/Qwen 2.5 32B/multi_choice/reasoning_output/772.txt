### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Examine the given information**
- Line \( k \) intersects line \( l \) perpendicularly. This means the angle between \( k \) and \( l \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- Line \( k \) also intersects line \( m \) at an angle of \( x^\circ \).
- Lines \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel.

#### **Step 2: Understand the geometric relationships**
- Since \( k \) is perpendicular to \( l \), the angle between \( k \) and \( l \) is \( 90^\circ \).
- The angle \( x \) is formed between line \( k \) and line \( m \). Because lines \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel, the angle \( x \) can vary, but it must be different from \( 90^\circ \) because \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel (otherwise, \( x \) would be \( 90^\circ \)).

#### **Step 3: Analyze the possible values of \( x \)**
- If \( l \) and \( m \) were parallel, then the angle \( x \) would be exactly \( 90^\circ \) because \( k \) is perpendicular to \( l \). However, since \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel, \( x \) cannot be \( 90^\circ \).
- The angle \( x \) can be slightly less than \( 90^\circ \) (e.g., \( 89^\circ \)) or slightly more than \( 90^\circ \) (e.g., \( 91^\circ, 92^\circ, 93^\circ \)), but it cannot be exactly \( 90^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Compare with the answer choices**
- The answer choices are: \( 89^\circ \), \( 90^\circ \), \( 91^\circ \), \( 92^\circ \), and \( 93^\circ \).
- From the analysis, we know that \( x \) cannot be \( 90^\circ \) because lines \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel.

#### **Step 5: Conclude the solution**
- The value of \( x \) that cannot be true is \( 90^\circ \).
