### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a curve that is symmetric about the origin and lies in the second and fourth quadrants. The task is to determine whether this relation is a function using the **vertical line test**.

#### Step 1: Understand the Vertical Line Test
The vertical line test states that a relation is a function if every vertical line intersects the graph at most once. If any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, the relation is **not a function**.

#### Step 2: Examine the Graph
- The graph is symmetric about the origin, meaning if a point \((x, y)\) is on the graph, then \((-x, -y)\) is also on the graph.
- The curve extends from the second quadrant into the fourth quadrant.
- Visually, the curve appears smooth and does not intersect itself horizontally.

#### Step 3: Apply the Vertical Line Test
To apply the vertical line test:
1. Imagine drawing vertical lines across the graph.
2. Check if any vertical line intersects the graph more than once.

From the image:
- No vertical line can intersect the graph more than once. This is because the curve is smooth and does not loop back on itself horizontally.
- The symmetry about the origin ensures that for each \(x\)-value, there is only one corresponding \(y\)-value.

#### Step 4: Conclusion
Since no vertical line intersects the graph more than once, the relation satisfies the vertical line test. Therefore, the relation is a function.
