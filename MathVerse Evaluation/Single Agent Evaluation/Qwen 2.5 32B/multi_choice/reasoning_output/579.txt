QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

Which of the following could model the percentage that Lucy can still recall after $t$ days?

CHOICES:
A:$Q=(0.85)^{t}$
B:$Q=(0.83)^{t}$
C:$Q=(0.87)^{t}$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the solution steps systematically:

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The graph shows the recall percentage over time for two individuals: Maximilian (gray curve) and Lucy (black curve).
- Maximilian forgets **15%** of what he could recount the day before. This means that each day, Maximilian retains **85%** of his previous day's recall. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
  \[
  Q_{\text{Maximilian}} = (0.85)^t
  \]
  where \( t \) is the number of days.
- The black curve (Lucy's recall) is steeper than the gray curve (Maximilian's recall), indicating that Lucy forgets more quickly than Maximilian. Therefore, Lucy's retention rate per day must be less than **85%**.

### Step 2: Understand the relationship between retention and the model
- The general form of the retention model is:
  \[
  Q = r^t
  \]
  where \( r \) is the daily retention rate (a fraction less than 1).
- For Maximilian, \( r = 0.85 \). Since Lucy forgets more quickly, her retention rate \( r \) must be less than **0.85**.

### Step 3: Compare Lucy's retention rate with the given options
- The options provided are:
  - A: \( Q = (0.85)^t \)
  - B: \( Q = (0.83)^t \)
  - C: \( Q = (0.87)^t \)
- From the analysis above, Lucy's retention rate \( r \) must be less than **0.85**. Therefore, we can eliminate option C (\( r = 0.87 \)) because it is greater than 0.85.
- Between options A (\( r = 0.85 \)) and B (\( r = 0.83 \)), option B corresponds to a faster forgetting rate (since \( 0.83 < 0.85 \)). This aligns with the observation that Lucy's curve is steeper than Maximilian's.

### Step 4: Conclusion
The model that best fits Lucy's recall percentage after \( t \) days is:
\[
Q = (0.83)^t
\]

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
