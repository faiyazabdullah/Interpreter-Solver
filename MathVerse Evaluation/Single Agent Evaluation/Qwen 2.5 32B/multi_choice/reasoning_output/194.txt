### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the outer diameter of the round nut based on the given geometric configuration. Let's break down the problem step by step:

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- **Angle**: \( \angle CAB = 60^\circ \)
- **Length**: \( AD = 6 \) cm
- The round nut is tangent to the horizontal line (ruler) at point \( A \) and also touches the slanted line \( AB \).

#### Step 2: Visualize the Geometry
The round nut is circular, and its center is denoted as \( O \). Since the nut is tangent to both the horizontal line and the slanted line, the following observations can be made:
- The radius of the nut, say \( r \), is perpendicular to the tangent points.
- The center \( O \) of the nut lies vertically above point \( A \) because the nut is tangent to the horizontal line at \( A \).
- The slanted line \( AB \) forms a \( 60^\circ \) angle with the horizontal line.

#### Step 3: Use Geometric Properties
Since the nut is tangent to the slanted line \( AB \), the radius from the center \( O \) to the point of tangency on \( AB \) is perpendicular to \( AB \). This forms a right triangle involving the radius \( r \), the horizontal distance \( AD \), and the slanted line.

#### Step 4: Analyze the Right Triangle
Let's denote:
- The center of the nut as \( O \).
- The point where the radius is perpendicular to \( AB \) as \( P \).
- The radius of the nut as \( r \).

From the geometry:
- The vertical distance from \( O \) to the horizontal line is \( r \).
- The horizontal distance from \( A \) to \( D \) is given as \( AD = 6 \) cm.
- The slanted line \( AB \) makes a \( 60^\circ \) angle with the horizontal.

In the right triangle formed by \( O \), \( A \), and the projection of \( O \) onto \( AB \):
- The horizontal leg is \( 6 \) cm (distance \( AD \)).
- The vertical leg is \( r \) (radius of the nut).
- The hypotenuse is the line segment from \( O \) to the point of tangency on \( AB \).

Using trigonometry in the right triangle:
\[ \tan(60^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{r}{6} \]
\[ \tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3} \]
\[ \sqrt{3} = \frac{r}{6} \]
\[ r = 6\sqrt{3} \]

#### Step 5: Find the Outer Diameter
The outer diameter of the round nut is twice the radius:
\[ \text{Diameter} = 2r = 2 \times 6\sqrt{3} = 12\sqrt{3} \]

#### Step 6: Match with Answer Choices
The calculated outer diameter is \( 12\sqrt{3} \) cm. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 12 cm
- B: 24 cm
- C: \( 6\sqrt{3} \) cm
- D: \( 12\sqrt{3} \) cm

The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{D} \]

### Final Answer: D
