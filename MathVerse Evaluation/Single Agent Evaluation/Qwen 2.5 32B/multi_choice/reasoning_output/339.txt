To solve the problem, let's follow the steps systematically:

### Step 1: Examine the given information
- Point B is **due East** of point A. This means the direction from A to B is along the positive x-axis (090° true bearing).
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is formed by the dashed line.
- Angle \( \angle A = 49^\circ \).
- Angle \( \angle B = 41^\circ \).

### Step 2: Understand the geometric relationships
Since point B is due East of point A, the direction from A to B is straightforward. However, we need to confirm whether the angles provided affect the bearing calculation. The angles \( \angle A \) and \( \angle B \) are part of triangle \( \triangle ABC \), but they do not change the fact that B is directly East of A.

### Step 3: Determine the true bearing of point B from point A
The true bearing is defined as the angle measured clockwise from the North direction. Since point B is due East of point A, the true bearing from A to B is simply **090°**.

### Step 4: Verify the angles
The angles \( \angle A = 49^\circ \) and \( \angle B = 41^\circ \) are internal angles of triangle \( \triangle ABC \). They do not affect the direction from A to B because the problem explicitly states that B is due East of A. These angles are only relevant to the shape of the triangle and not to the bearing calculation.

### Step 5: Compare with the answer choices
The true bearing of point B from point A is **090° T**. This matches choice A.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
