### Analysis and Solution:

#### Step 1: Examine the given information
- The image shows a rectangle inscribed in a circle.
- The rectangle has dimensions 8 inches and 6 inches.
- The circle's circumference needs to be determined.

#### Step 2: Understand the geometric relationships
- When a rectangle is inscribed in a circle, the diagonal of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the circle. This is because the diagonal of the rectangle spans from one point on the circle to the opposite point, passing through the center.
- The diagonal of the rectangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.

#### Step 3: Calculate the diagonal of the rectangle
The diagonal \( d \) of the rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2}
\]
Substitute the given dimensions:
\[
d = \sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10 \text{ inches}
\]
Thus, the diagonal of the rectangle is 10 inches.

#### Step 4: Relate the diagonal to the circle
Since the diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the circle, the diameter \( D \) of the circle is:
\[
D = 10 \text{ inches}
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the circumference of the circle
The circumference \( C \) of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
C = \pi \times D
\]
Substitute the diameter:
\[
C = \pi \times 10 = 10\pi
\]

#### Step 6: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated circumference is \( 10\pi \). Matching this with the given answer choices:
- A: \( 8\pi \)
- B: \( 10\pi \)
- C: \( 16\pi \)
- D: \( 20\pi \)

The correct answer is \( 10\pi \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
