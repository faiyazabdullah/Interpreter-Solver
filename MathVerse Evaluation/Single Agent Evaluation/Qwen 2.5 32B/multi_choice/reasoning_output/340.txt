### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
- We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with the following:
  - \( \angle A = 49^\circ \)
  - \( \angle B = 41^\circ \)
- We need to find the **true bearing** of point \( B \) from point \( C \).

#### Step 2: Determine \( \angle C \)
In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \). Using this property:
\[
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
49^\circ + 41^\circ + \angle C = 180^\circ
\]
Solve for \( \angle C \):
\[
\angle C = 180^\circ - 49^\circ - 41^\circ = 90^\circ
\]

#### Step 3: Interpret the Diagram
The diagram shows:
- Point \( A \) at the left with a bearing marker indicating \( 45^\circ \).
- Point \( B \) at the right with a bearing marker indicating \( 37^\circ \).
- The dashed line forms \( \triangle ABC \).

The bearing markers suggest directions relative to the cardinal directions (North, East, etc.). However, the true bearing of point \( B \) from point \( C \) involves determining the direction of \( \overrightarrow{CB} \) relative to North.

#### Step 4: Determine the True Bearing of \( B \) from \( C \)
To find the true bearing of \( B \) from \( C \), we need to analyze the orientation of \( \triangle ABC \) and the given bearings.

1. **Identify the orientation of \( \triangle ABC \)**:
   - Since \( \angle C = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle C \) as the right angle.
   - The side \( AB \) is the hypotenuse, and the sides \( AC \) and \( BC \) are the legs.

2. **Use the given bearings**:
   - The bearing marker at \( A \) indicates \( 45^\circ \). This suggests that the direction from North to \( A \) is \( 45^\circ \) clockwise from North.
   - The bearing marker at \( B \) indicates \( 37^\circ \). This suggests that the direction from North to \( B \) is \( 37^\circ \) clockwise from North.

3. **Determine the direction of \( \overrightarrow{CB} \)**:
   - Since \( \angle C = 90^\circ \), the direction of \( \overrightarrow{CB} \) is perpendicular to \( \overrightarrow{CA} \).
   - From the diagram, \( \overrightarrow{CB} \) is oriented such that it makes an angle of \( 37^\circ \) with respect to the horizontal (East-West axis).

4. **Convert to True Bearing**:
   - The true bearing is measured clockwise from North.
   - Since \( \overrightarrow{CB} \) is oriented \( 37^\circ \) east of north, the true bearing of \( B \) from \( C \) is \( 37^\circ \).

#### Step 5: Match the Answer with the Choices
The true bearing of point \( B \) from point \( C \) is \( 37^\circ \). Comparing this with the given choices:
- A. \( 053^\circ \mathrm{T} \)
- B. \( 082^\circ \mathrm{T} \)
- C. \( 045^\circ \mathrm{T} \)
- D. \( 037^\circ \mathrm{T} \)

The correct answer is \( 037^\circ \mathrm{T} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
