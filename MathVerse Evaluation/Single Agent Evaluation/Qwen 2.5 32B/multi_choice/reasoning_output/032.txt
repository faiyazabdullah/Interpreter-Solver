### Analysis and Solution:

#### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We are given a triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with an inscribed circle (incircle) centered at \( I \). The incircle is tangent to the sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) at points \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) respectively. The problem states that \( \angle DEF = 52^\circ \), and we need to find the measure of \( \angle A \).

#### Step 2: Key Geometric Properties
1. **Incircle Tangency Points**: The points \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) are the points where the incircle touches the sides \( AB \), \( BC \), and \( CA \) respectively.
2. **Incircle Center \( I \)**: The center \( I \) is the incenter of \( \triangle ABC \), which is the intersection of the angle bisectors of the triangle.
3. **Angle Relationships**: The angle \( \angle DEF \) is formed by the tangents from the incircle to the sides of the triangle. The key property here is that the angle \( \angle DEF \) is related to the angles of \( \triangle ABC \).

#### Step 3: Relationship Between \( \angle DEF \) and \( \angle A \)
The angle \( \angle DEF \) is an external angle to the quadrilateral formed by the tangents and the sides of the triangle. Using the properties of the incircle and the tangents, we know:
\[
\angle DEF = 90^\circ - \frac{\angle A}{2}
\]
This relationship comes from the fact that the angle formed by two tangents to a circle from an external point is equal to \( 90^\circ \) minus half the angle subtended by the arc between the points of tangency.

#### Step 4: Solve for \( \angle A \)
Given:
\[
\angle DEF = 52^\circ
\]
Using the relationship:
\[
\angle DEF = 90^\circ - \frac{\angle A}{2}
\]
Substitute \( \angle DEF = 52^\circ \):
\[
52^\circ = 90^\circ - \frac{\angle A}{2}
\]
Rearrange to solve for \( \angle A \):
\[
\frac{\angle A}{2} = 90^\circ - 52^\circ
\]
\[
\frac{\angle A}{2} = 38^\circ
\]
\[
\angle A = 2 \times 38^\circ = 76^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Answer
The calculation shows that \( \angle A = 76^\circ \). This matches one of the given answer choices.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
