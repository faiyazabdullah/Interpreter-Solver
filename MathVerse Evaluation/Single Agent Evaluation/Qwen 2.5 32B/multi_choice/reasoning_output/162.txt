### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves a circle with a central angle \( \angle BOC \) and a corresponding inscribed (circumference) angle \( \angle BAC \). The key relationship between these angles is governed by the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**.

#### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- The inscribed angle \( \angle BAC \) is given as \( 40^\circ \).
- The central angle \( \angle BOC \) subtends the same arc \( BC \) as the inscribed angle \( \angle BAC \).

#### Step 2: Apply the Inscribed Angle Theorem
The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Mathematically:
\[
\text{Measure of the inscribed angle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of the central angle}
\]
Let \( \angle BOC \) be the central angle. Then:
\[
\angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle BOC
\]

#### Step 3: Solve for the Central Angle
Given \( \angle BAC = 40^\circ \):
\[
40^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle BOC
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( \angle BOC \):
\[
\angle BOC = 2 \times 40^\circ = 80^\circ
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Solution
The Inscribed Angle Theorem ensures that the central angle is twice the inscribed angle when they subtend the same arc. Here, \( \angle BOC = 80^\circ \) is indeed twice \( \angle BAC = 40^\circ \), confirming the correctness of the calculation.

#### Step 5: Match the Answer with the Choices
The calculated value of \( \angle BOC \) is \( 80^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 40°
- B: 60°
- C: 80°
- D: 100°

The correct choice is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
