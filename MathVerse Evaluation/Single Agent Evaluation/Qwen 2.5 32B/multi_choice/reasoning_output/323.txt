### Analysis of the Problem:
The given problem involves a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with intersecting diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) that are perpendicular to each other. The key features provided are:
- \(AB = AD\), meaning \(\triangle ABD\) is isosceles.
- \(BC = DC\), meaning \(\triangle BCD\) is isosceles.
- The diagonals intersect at a point \(O\), where \(DO = 5\) and \(CO = 12\).

We are tasked with finding the length of \(BC\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Understanding the Geometry**:
Since the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) are perpendicular, we can use the properties of right triangles formed by these diagonals. Let the diagonals intersect at point \(O\). This means:
- \(AO\) and \(CO\) are segments of diagonal \(AC\).
- \(BO\) and \(DO\) are segments of diagonal \(BD\).

Given:
- \(DO = 5\)
- \(CO = 12\)

#### 2. **Using the Perpendicular Diagonals Property**:
In a quadrilateral where the diagonals are perpendicular, the lengths of the diagonals can be used to find the sides using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed. Specifically, since \(AB = AD\) and \(BC = DC\), the quadrilateral is a kite (a special type of quadrilateral with two pairs of adjacent equal sides).

#### 3. **Applying the Kite Properties**:
In a kite, the diagonals are perpendicular, and the longer diagonal bisects the shorter diagonal. However, in this case, we are directly given the segments of the diagonals. We can use the fact that the diagonals divide the kite into four right triangles.

#### 4. **Finding \(BC\)**:
Since \(BC = DC\) and the diagonals are perpendicular, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle BOC\):
- \(BO\) is the unknown segment of diagonal \(BD\).
- \(CO = 12\)
- \(BC\) is the hypotenuse of \(\triangle BOC\).

From the symmetry and properties of the kite, we know that the diagonals divide the kite into congruent right triangles. Therefore, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle DOC\) to find \(BD\):
\[ BD = BO + OD = BO + 5 \]

However, we can directly use the fact that \(BC\) is the hypotenuse of \(\triangle BOC\):
\[ BC = \sqrt{BO^2 + CO^2} \]

Since \(BO = DO = 5\) (by symmetry and the properties of the kite), we have:
\[ BC = \sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{25 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13 \]

#### 5. **Conclusion**:
The length of \(BC\) is \(13\).
