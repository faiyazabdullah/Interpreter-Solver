### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a semicircular tunnel with a radius of 3.4 meters. A truck with a width of 3.2 meters is passing through the tunnel. We need to determine how high the truck can be while still fitting within the tunnel.

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry
- The tunnel's cross-section is a semicircle with a radius \( r = 3.4 \) meters.
- The truck has a width of 3.2 meters, which corresponds to the horizontal distance across the semicircle.
- We need to find the maximum height of the truck that allows it to fit within the semicircle.

#### Step 2: Define Variables and Relationships
- Let the center of the semicircle be at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The equation of the semicircle is \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \), where \( r = 3.4 \). Since it is a semicircle, \( y \geq 0 \).
- The width of the truck is 3.2 meters, so the truck spans from \( x = -1.6 \) to \( x = 1.6 \) (since \( \frac{3.2}{2} = 1.6 \)).

#### Step 3: Calculate the Height of the Tunnel at \( x = 1.6 \)
To find the maximum height of the truck, we need to determine the value of \( y \) at \( x = 1.6 \). Using the equation of the semicircle:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
\]
Substitute \( x = 1.6 \) and \( r = 3.4 \):
\[
(1.6)^2 + y^2 = (3.4)^2
\]
\[
2.56 + y^2 = 11.56
\]
\[
y^2 = 11.56 - 2.56
\]
\[
y^2 = 9
\]
\[
y = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

#### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The value \( y = 3 \) represents the height of the semicircle at \( x = 1.6 \). This is the maximum height at which the truck can pass through the tunnel without exceeding the semicircle's boundary.

#### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated height is 3 meters. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 3 m
- B: 3.4 m
- C: 4 m
- D: 2.8 m

The closest and correct answer is 3 meters.

### Final Answer:
