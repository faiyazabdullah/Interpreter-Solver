### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves a circle with center \( O \) and a point \( C \) on the circumference. We are given that \( \angle ACB = 35^\circ \), and we need to find the measure of \( \angle AOB \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
- \( O \) is the center of the circle.
- \( C \) is a point on the circumference of the circle.
- \( \angle ACB = 35^\circ \).
- \( A \) and \( B \) are points on the circumference such that \( \angle AOB \) is the central angle subtended by the arc \( AB \).

#### Step 2: Key Geometric Relationship
The key relationship here is between the inscribed angle \( \angle ACB \) and the central angle \( \angle AOB \). According to the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**:
- An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
- Mathematically, if \( \angle ACB \) is an inscribed angle subtending the arc \( AB \), then:
  \[
  \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOB
  \]

#### Step 3: Applying the Inscribed Angle Theorem
We are given \( \angle ACB = 35^\circ \). Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
\[
\angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOB
\]
Substitute \( \angle ACB = 35^\circ \):
\[
35^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \angle AOB
\]

#### Step 4: Solving for \( \angle AOB \)
To find \( \angle AOB \), multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
\angle AOB = 2 \times 35^\circ = 70^\circ
\]

#### Step 5: Verifying the Solution
The Inscribed Angle Theorem guarantees that the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc. Our calculation aligns with this theorem, confirming that \( \angle AOB = 70^\circ \).

#### Step 6: Selecting the Correct Answer
From the answer choices:
- A: 35°
- B: 70°
- C: 105°
- D: 150°

The correct answer is \( 70^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
