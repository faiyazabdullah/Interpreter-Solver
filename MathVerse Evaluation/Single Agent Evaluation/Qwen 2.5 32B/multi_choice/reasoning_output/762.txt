### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- $ CD = 7 $,
- $ CF = 15 $,
- $ CDEF $ is a rectangle,
- The area of triangle $ \triangle CAF $ is equal to the area of rectangle $ CDEF $.

We need to find the length of segment $ AD $.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of rectangle $ CDEF $
Since $ CDEF $ is a rectangle, its area is given by:
\[
\text{Area of } CDEF = \text{length} \times \text{width} = CF \times CD = 15 \times 7 = 105.
\]

### Step 2: Express the area of triangle $ \triangle CAF $
The area of triangle $ \triangle CAF $ can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle CAF = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}.
\]
Here, the base of the triangle is $ CF = 15 $, and the height is the perpendicular distance from point $ A $ to line $ CF $. Let the height be $ h = AD + CD = AD + 7 $.

Thus, the area of $ \triangle CAF $ is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle CAF = \frac{1}{2} \times CF \times (AD + CD) = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times (AD + 7).
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equation using the given condition
We are told that the area of $ \triangle CAF $ is equal to the area of rectangle $ CDEF $. Therefore:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times (AD + 7) = 105.
\]

### Step 4: Solve for $ AD $
First, simplify the equation:
\[
\frac{15}{2} \times (AD + 7) = 105.
\]
Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
15 \times (AD + 7) = 210.
\]
Divide both sides by 15:
\[
AD + 7 = 14.
\]
Subtract 7 from both sides:
\[
AD = 7.
\]

### Step 5: Verify the solution
The length of $ AD $ is 7. Let us verify:
- The height of $ \triangle CAF $ is $ AD + CD = 7 + 7 = 14 $.
- The area of $ \triangle CAF $ is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times 14 = \frac{1}{2} \times 210 = 105.
  \]
- This matches the area of rectangle $ CDEF $, which is 105. The solution is consistent.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
