### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given a geometric figure where triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed in a circle with center \( O \). The diameter of the circle is \( AC \), and it is stated that \( AB = AO \). We need to find the measure of \( \angle ABO \).

#### Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
1. **Circle with Center \( O \)**: The circle has its center at \( O \).
2. **Diameter \( AC \)**: Since \( AC \) is the diameter, \( \angle ABC \) is a right angle (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem).
3. **Equality \( AB = AO \)**: This tells us that \( AB \) is equal in length to the radius of the circle. Therefore, \( AB \) is also the radius of the circle.
4. **Triangle \( \triangle ABO \)**: We need to analyze this triangle to find \( \angle ABO \).

#### Step 2: Identifying Key Properties
- Since \( O \) is the center of the circle, \( AO \) is a radius of the circle.
- Given \( AB = AO \), \( AB \) is also a radius of the circle.
- Therefore, \( \triangle ABO \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AO \).

#### Step 3: Analyzing \( \triangle ABO \)
- In \( \triangle ABO \), \( AB = AO \) implies that the base angles opposite these sides are equal. Thus, \( \angle ABO = \angle AOB \).
- Let \( \angle ABO = \angle AOB = x \).
- The sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, in \( \triangle ABO \):
  \[
  \angle BAO + \angle ABO + \angle AOB = 180^\circ
  \]
  Substituting \( \angle ABO = \angle AOB = x \):
  \[
  \angle BAO + x + x = 180^\circ
  \]
  \[
  \angle BAO + 2x = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Using the Right Angle Property
- Since \( AC \) is the diameter, \( \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).
- In \( \triangle ABC \), \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle BCA \) are the remaining angles. However, we focus on \( \triangle ABO \).

#### Step 5: Solving for \( x \)
- From the isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABO \):
  \[
  \angle BAO = 180^\circ - 2x
  \]
- Since \( AB = AO \), \( \triangle ABO \) is isosceles, and the base angles are equal. The key is to recognize that \( \angle BAO \) is part of the larger context of the circle and the right angle at \( B \).

#### Step 6: Geometric Insight
- Since \( AB = AO \) and \( O \) is the center, \( \triangle ABO \) is isosceles with \( AB = AO \). The angle \( \angle ABO \) is half of the remaining angle after accounting for the right angle at \( B \).
- By symmetry and the properties of isosceles triangles, \( \angle ABO = 30^\circ \).

#### Final Calculation
- The measure of \( \angle ABO \) is \( 30^\circ \).

### Conclusion
The degree measure of \( \angle ABO \) is \( 30^\circ \).
