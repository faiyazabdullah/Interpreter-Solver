QUESTION:
Kai is swinging on a trapeze in a circus show. The horizontal distance between Kai and the edge of the stage, in meters, is modeled by $D(t)$ where $t$ is the time in seconds. The function is graphed below, along with one segment highlighted, a red double arrow from (5,21) to (15,21). What is the meaning of the highlighted segment?

CHOICES:
A:Kai completes 10 swing cycles per second.
B:The trapeze is hung $\mathbf{1 0}$ meters from the edge of the stage.
C:Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds.
D:The trapeze is $\mathbf{1 0}$ meters long.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves interpreting a graph that models the horizontal distance \( D(t) \) between Kai and the edge of the stage as a function of time \( t \). The highlighted segment on the graph is a horizontal line segment from the point \((5, 21)\) to \((15, 21)\).

#### Step 1: Examine the Graph
- The graph shows a periodic oscillation, indicating that Kai's motion on the trapeze is cyclic.
- The highlighted segment is a horizontal line at \( y = 21 \) from \( t = 5 \) to \( t = 15 \).
- This segment represents a constant distance of 21 meters from the edge of the stage over a time interval of 10 seconds.

#### Step 2: Understand the Highlighted Segment
- The highlighted segment indicates that during the time interval from \( t = 5 \) to \( t = 15 \), the horizontal distance \( D(t) \) remains constant at 21 meters.
- This suggests a specific behavior in Kai's motion during this interval.

#### Step 3: Interpret the Meaning of the Highlighted Segment
- **Option A**: "Kai completes 10 swing cycles per second."
  - This interpretation is incorrect because the highlighted segment does not indicate anything about the frequency of swing cycles. Instead, it shows a constant distance over a period of 10 seconds.
  
- **Option B**: "The trapeze is hung 10 meters from the edge of the stage."
  - This interpretation is incorrect because the highlighted segment shows a constant distance of 21 meters, not 10 meters. Additionally, the segment does not provide information about the length or position of the trapeze itself.

- **Option C**: "Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds."
  - This interpretation is plausible because the highlighted segment spans 10 seconds and shows a constant distance, which could correspond to one complete swing cycle. During a full swing cycle, the trapeze typically reaches its maximum distance from the edge of the stage and returns to the starting point.

- **Option D**: "The trapeze is 10 meters long."
  - This interpretation is incorrect because the highlighted segment shows a constant distance of 21 meters, not 10 meters. Additionally, the length of the trapeze is not directly related to the horizontal distance \( D(t) \).

#### Step 4: Select the Correct Answer
The highlighted segment indicates that Kai's horizontal distance from the edge of the stage remains constant at 21 meters for 10 seconds, which is consistent with completing a single swing cycle in that time.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
