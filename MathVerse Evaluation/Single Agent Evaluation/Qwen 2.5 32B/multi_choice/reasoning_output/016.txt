### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure involving a circle with center \( O \). Here are the key details from the image and problem statement:
- Chord \( AC \) is parallel to radius \( OB \).
- Angle \( \angle BOC = 50^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle OAB \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- \( O \) is the center of the circle.
- \( AC \) is a chord parallel to the radius \( OB \).
- \( \angle BOC = 50^\circ \).

#### **Step 2: Use the property of parallel lines**
Since \( AC \parallel OB \), the alternate interior angles formed by the transversal \( OC \) are equal. Therefore:
\[ \angle ACO = \angle COB = 50^\circ. \]

#### **Step 3: Use the fact that \( OA = OC \) (radii of the circle)**
In \( \triangle OAC \), since \( OA = OC \), the triangle is isosceles. In an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. Thus:
\[ \angle OAC = \angle OCA. \]
From Step 2, we know \( \angle OCA = 50^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ \angle OAC = 50^\circ. \]

#### **Step 4: Find \( \angle AOB \)**
Since \( AC \parallel OB \), the corresponding angles \( \angle AOB \) and \( \angle BOC \) are supplementary to the angles they form with the transversal \( AB \). However, we can use the fact that the total angle around point \( O \) is \( 360^\circ \). The key is to focus on the isosceles triangle properties and the parallel lines.

#### **Step 5: Use the isosceles triangle property again**
In \( \triangle OAB \), since \( OA = OB \) (both are radii of the circle), the triangle is isosceles. Therefore:
\[ \angle OAB = \angle OBA. \]

#### **Step 6: Calculate \( \angle OAB \)**
We know that the sum of the angles in any triangle is \( 180^\circ \). In \( \triangle OAB \):
\[ \angle OAB + \angle OBA + \angle AOB = 180^\circ. \]
Since \( \angle AOB = 50^\circ \) (from the given information and the properties of parallel lines), and \( \angle OAB = \angle OBA \):
\[ 2 \cdot \angle OAB + 50^\circ = 180^\circ. \]
Solving for \( \angle OAB \):
\[ 2 \cdot \angle OAB = 130^\circ, \]
\[ \angle OAB = 65^\circ / 2 = 25^\circ. \]

### Final Answer:
The measure of \( \angle OAB \) is \( 25^\circ \).
