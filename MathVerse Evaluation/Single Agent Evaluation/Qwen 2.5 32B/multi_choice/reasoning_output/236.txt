====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:
The image shows two rays intersecting at a point, forming four angles labeled as \( x^\circ \). Since these rays intersect, they create four angles around the intersection point. The key property we need to use here is that the sum of the angles around a point is always **360 degrees**.

#### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - There are four angles formed by the intersection of two rays.
   - Each angle is labeled as \( x^\circ \).

2. **Understand the Relationship:**
   - The sum of all angles around a point is **360 degrees**.
   - Since there are four angles, and each angle is \( x^\circ \), the total sum of the angles can be expressed as:
     \[
     x + x + x + x = 4x
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the property of angles around a point:
     \[
     4x = 360
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 4:
     \[
     x = \frac{360}{4} = 90
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If each angle is \( 90^\circ \), then the sum of the four angles is:
     \[
     90^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ + 90^\circ = 360^\circ
     \]
   - This satisfies the condition that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees.

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( x \) is 90.
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: 60
     - B: 80
     - C: 90
     - D: 120

7. **Select the Correct Answer:**
   - The correct answer is \( 90 \), which corresponds to choice C.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
