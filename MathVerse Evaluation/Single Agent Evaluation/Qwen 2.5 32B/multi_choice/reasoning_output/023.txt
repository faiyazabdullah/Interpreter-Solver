### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric figure where:
- \( PA \) and \( PB \) are tangents to circle \( O \) at points \( A \) and \( B \), respectively.
- \( \angle C = 65^\circ \), where \( \angle C \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AB \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle P \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understanding the given information**
- \( PA \) and \( PB \) are tangents to the circle at points \( A \) and \( B \). This implies:
  - \( OA \perp PA \) (since the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency).
  - \( OB \perp PB \) (similarly, the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency).

- \( \angle C = 65^\circ \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AB \). By the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Central angle } \angle AOB = 2 \times \angle C = 2 \times 65^\circ = 130^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 2: Analyzing the tangents and the quadrilateral**
- Since \( PA \) and \( PB \) are tangents from a common external point \( P \), we know:
  - \( PA = PB \) (tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length).
  - \( \angle OAP = \angle OBP = 90^\circ \) (radius is perpendicular to the tangent).

- Consider the quadrilateral \( OAPB \):
  - \( \angle OAP = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle OBP = 90^\circ \)
  - \( \angle AOB = 130^\circ \)

- The sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is \( 360^\circ \). Therefore:
  \[
  \angle OAP + \angle OBP + \angle AOB + \angle APB = 360^\circ.
  \]
  Substituting the known values:
  \[
  90^\circ + 90^\circ + 130^\circ + \angle APB = 360^\circ.
  \]
  Simplifying:
  \[
  310^\circ + \angle APB = 360^\circ.
  \]
  Solving for \( \angle APB \):
  \[
  \angle APB = 360^\circ - 310^\circ = 50^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 3: Conclusion**
The measure of \( \angle P \) is \( 50^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
