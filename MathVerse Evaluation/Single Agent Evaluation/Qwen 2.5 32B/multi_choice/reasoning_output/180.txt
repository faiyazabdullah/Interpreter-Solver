To solve the problem, we will analyze the given geometric figure step by step and use relevant theorems and properties.

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- **Triangle \( \triangle ABC \)** is inscribed in circle \( O \).
- \( OC \perp OB \): This means \( \angle COB = 90^\circ \).
- \( OD \perp AB \): Line \( OD \) is perpendicular to \( AB \) and intersects \( AC \) at point \( E \).
- The radius of circle \( O \) is 1.
- We need to find the value of \( AE^2 + CE^2 \).

### Step 2: Key Observations and Properties
1. **Circle Geometry**: Since \( O \) is the center of the circle and the radius is 1, the coordinates of points can be expressed using the circle's properties.
2. **Perpendicularity**: 
   - \( OC \perp OB \) implies \( \angle COB = 90^\circ \).
   - \( OD \perp AB \) implies \( OD \) is the altitude from \( O \) to \( AB \), and \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AB \) because \( O \) is the center of the circle.
3. **Power of a Point**: The power of a point theorem can be useful here, but we will use coordinate geometry and properties of right triangles.

### Step 3: Coordinate Setup
Let us place the circle in the coordinate plane for simplicity:
- Center \( O \) is at the origin: \( O = (0, 0) \).
- Radius of the circle is 1, so the equation of the circle is \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

#### Placing Points:
- Since \( OC \perp OB \) and both are radii of the circle, we can place:
  - \( C = (1, 0) \) (on the x-axis).
  - \( B = (0, 1) \) (on the y-axis).

#### Equation of Line \( AB \):
- Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the circle. Let \( A = (a, b) \) where \( a^2 + b^2 = 1 \).
- The line \( AB \) passes through \( A = (a, b) \) and \( B = (0, 1) \). The slope of \( AB \) is:
  \[
  \text{slope of } AB = \frac{b - 1}{a - 0} = \frac{b - 1}{a}.
  \]
  The equation of line \( AB \) is:
  \[
  y - 1 = \frac{b - 1}{a}(x - 0) \implies y = \frac{b - 1}{a}x + 1.
  \]

#### Perpendicular from \( O \) to \( AB \):
- The line \( OD \) is perpendicular to \( AB \). The slope of \( OD \) is the negative reciprocal of the slope of \( AB \):
  \[
  \text{slope of } OD = -\frac{a}{b - 1}.
  \]
  Since \( OD \) passes through the origin \( O = (0, 0) \), its equation is:
  \[
  y = -\frac{a}{b - 1}x.
  \]

#### Intersection of \( OD \) and \( AC \):
- The line \( AC \) passes through \( A = (a, b) \) and \( C = (1, 0) \). The slope of \( AC \) is:
  \[
  \text{slope of } AC = \frac{b - 0}{a - 1} = \frac{b}{a - 1}.
  \]
  The equation of line \( AC \) is:
  \[
  y - b = \frac{b}{a - 1}(x - a) \implies y = \frac{b}{a - 1}x - \frac{ab}{a - 1} + b.
  \]

### Step 4: Using the Power of a Point Theorem
The key insight here is to use the fact that \( E \) lies on \( AC \) and \( OD \perp AB \). By the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the circle and the perpendicular from the center, we can use the property that for any point \( E \) on \( AC \):
\[
AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2.
\]

#### Length of \( AC \):
- The distance between \( A = (a, b) \) and \( C = (1, 0) \) is:
  \[
  AC = \sqrt{(a - 1)^2 + b^2}.
  \]
  Since \( a^2 + b^2 = 1 \), we have:
  \[
  AC^2 = (a - 1)^2 + b^2 = a^2 - 2a + 1 + b^2 = 1 - 2a + 1 = 2 - 2a.
  \]

#### Simplification:
By the properties of the circle and the perpendicular from the center, we know that:
\[
AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2 = 2.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
