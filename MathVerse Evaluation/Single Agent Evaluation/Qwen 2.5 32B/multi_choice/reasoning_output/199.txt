### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem and Given Information**
- Circle \( O \) has a radius of 13 inches.
- Chord \( CD \) is 24 inches long.
- Radius \( OB \) is perpendicular to chord \( CD \) at point \( X \).
- We need to find the length of \( OX \).

#### **Step 2: Visualize and Use Geometric Properties**
1. Since \( OB \) is perpendicular to \( CD \), it bisects \( CD \) into two equal segments. This is a property of a radius perpendicular to a chord.
   \[
   CX = XD = \frac{CD}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ inches}.
   \]

2. Now, consider the right triangle \( OXC \):
   - \( OC \) is the radius of the circle, so \( OC = 13 \) inches.
   - \( CX = 12 \) inches (as calculated above).
   - \( OX \) is the unknown we need to find.

#### **Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**
In the right triangle \( OXC \):
\[
OC^2 = OX^2 + CX^2.
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
13^2 = OX^2 + 12^2.
\]
Simplify:
\[
169 = OX^2 + 144.
\]
Isolate \( OX^2 \):
\[
OX^2 = 169 - 144 = 25.
\]
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
OX = \sqrt{25} = 5.
\]

#### **Step 4: Verify the Calculation**
- The calculation follows the Pythagorean theorem correctly.
- The value \( OX = 5 \) satisfies the equation \( 13^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 \).

#### **Step 5: Match the Answer with the Choices**
The calculated value of \( OX \) is 5 inches. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 5
- B: 12
- C: 13
- D: 26

The correct answer is \( A \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: A
