### Analysis of the Problem:
We are given an equilateral triangle \( \triangle LMN \) with the following information:
- \( LM = 3x + 1 \)
- \( MN = 4x - 2 \)
- \( MP \) bisects \( LN \), meaning \( P \) is the midpoint of \( LN \).

Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, all sides are equal. Therefore:
\[ LM = MN = LN \]

Our goal is to find the length of one side of \( \triangle LMN \).

---

### Step 1: Use the property of equilateral triangles
Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, we have:
\[ LM = MN \]

Substitute the given expressions for \( LM \) and \( MN \):
\[ 3x + 1 = 4x - 2 \]

---

### Step 2: Solve for \( x \)
Rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
\[ 3x + 1 = 4x - 2 \]
\[ 1 + 2 = 4x - 3x \]
\[ 3 = x \]

So, \( x = 3 \).

---

### Step 3: Find the length of one side
Now that we have \( x = 3 \), substitute \( x \) back into the expression for \( LM \):
\[ LM = 3x + 1 \]
\[ LM = 3(3) + 1 \]
\[ LM = 9 + 1 \]
\[ LM = 10 \]

Since \( \triangle LMN \) is equilateral, all sides are equal:
\[ LM = MN = LN = 10 \]

---

### Step 4: Verify the solution
We need to check if \( MN = 4x - 2 \) also equals 10 when \( x = 3 \):
\[ MN = 4x - 2 \]
\[ MN = 4(3) - 2 \]
\[ MN = 12 - 2 \]
\[ MN = 10 \]

Both expressions for \( LM \) and \( MN \) yield the same value, confirming that the side length is consistent.

---

### Final Answer:
The measure of the side of \( \triangle LMN \) is \( 10 \).

Final Answer: B
