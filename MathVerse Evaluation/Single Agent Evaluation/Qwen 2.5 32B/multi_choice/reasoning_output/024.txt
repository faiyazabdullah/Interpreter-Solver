### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- Line \( a \) is parallel to line \( b \).
- Line \( c \) intersects both lines \( a \) and \( b \).
- Angle 1 is given as \( 50^\circ \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the geometric relationships**
Since \( a \parallel b \), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals:
- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal.
- Alternate interior angles are equal.
- Consecutive interior angles (also known as same-side interior angles) are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### **Step 3: Identify the relationship between angle 1 and angle 2**
- Angle 1 is formed by the intersection of line \( c \) with line \( a \).
- Since \( a \parallel b \), the angle corresponding to angle 1 on line \( b \) will also be \( 50^\circ \).
- Angle 2 is the consecutive interior angle to this corresponding angle on line \( b \). Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning their sum is \( 180^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Calculate angle 2**
Let the corresponding angle to angle 1 on line \( b \) be denoted as \( x \). Since \( a \parallel b \), we have:
\[ x = 50^\circ \]

Angle 2 is the consecutive interior angle to \( x \), so:
\[ \text{Angle 2} + x = 180^\circ \]
\[ \text{Angle 2} + 50^\circ = 180^\circ \]
\[ \text{Angle 2} = 180^\circ - 50^\circ \]
\[ \text{Angle 2} = 130^\circ \]

#### **Step 5: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated value of angle 2 is \( 130^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \( 150^\circ \)
- B: \( 130^\circ \)
- C: \( 100^\circ \)
- D: \( 50^\circ \)

#### **Final Answer:**
The correct answer is:
\[ \boxed{B} \]
