### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- Lines \( AB \) and \( CD \) are parallel (\( AB \parallel CD \)).
- Line \( EF \) intersects both \( AB \) and \( CD \) at points \( E \) and \( F \), respectively.
- Angle \( \angle 1 \) is given as \( 50^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of angle \( \angle 2 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- \( AB \parallel CD \): This means that lines \( AB \) and \( CD \) are parallel.
- \( EF \) is a transversal line intersecting both \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- \( \angle 1 = 50^\circ \): This is an angle formed by the transversal \( EF \) and line \( CD \).

#### **Step 2: Identify key angle relationships**
Since \( AB \parallel CD \), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals:
1. **Corresponding Angles**: When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal.
2. **Alternate Interior Angles**: When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, alternate interior angles are equal.
3. **Consecutive Interior Angles (Same-Side Interior Angles)**: When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### **Step 3: Determine the relationship between \( \angle 1 \) and other angles**
- \( \angle 1 \) is given as \( 50^\circ \). Since \( \angle 1 \) is an angle formed by the transversal \( EF \) and line \( CD \), we need to relate it to angle \( \angle 2 \).

#### **Step 4: Use the property of consecutive interior angles**
- \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle 2 \) are consecutive interior angles because they are on the same side of the transversal \( EF \) and between the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning their sum is \( 180^\circ \).

#### **Step 5: Calculate \( \angle 2 \)**
Using the property of supplementary angles:
\[
\angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute \( \angle 1 = 50^\circ \):
\[
50^\circ + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
\]
Solve for \( \angle 2 \):
\[
\angle 2 = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
\]

#### **Step 6: Compare with the answer choices**
The calculated value of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 130^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \( 50^\circ \)
- B: \( 120^\circ \)
- C: \( 130^\circ \)
- D: \( 150^\circ \)

The correct answer is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
