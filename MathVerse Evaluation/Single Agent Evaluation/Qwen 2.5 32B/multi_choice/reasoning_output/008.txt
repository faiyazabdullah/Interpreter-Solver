### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- Triangles \( \triangle ABC \) and \( \triangle DEF \) are congruent.
- Points \( A \) and \( D \), \( B \) and \( E \) are corresponding vertices.
- \( BC = 5.0 \).
- \( BF = 7.0 \).

We need to find the length of \( EC \).

#### **Step 2: Use the property of congruent triangles**
Since \( \triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF \):
- Corresponding sides are equal: \( AB = DE \), \( BC = EF \), and \( AC = DF \).
- Corresponding angles are equal: \( \angle A = \angle D \), \( \angle B = \angle E \), and \( \angle C = \angle F \).

From the given information, we know:
- \( BC = EF = 5.0 \).

#### **Step 3: Analyze the line segment \( BF \)**
The total length of \( BF \) is given as 7.0. This segment can be split into two parts:
- \( BE \): The part from \( B \) to \( E \).
- \( EF \): The part from \( E \) to \( F \).

Since \( BC = EF = 5.0 \), we have:
\[ BF = BE + EF. \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ 7.0 = BE + 5.0. \]

Solve for \( BE \):
\[ BE = 7.0 - 5.0 = 2.0. \]

#### **Step 4: Determine the length of \( EC \)**
In the figure, \( EC \) is the part of the line segment \( CF \) that lies between \( E \) and \( C \). Since \( E \) and \( C \) are points on the same line and \( EF = 5.0 \), we can see that:
\[ EC = EF - BE. \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ EC = 5.0 - 2.0 = 3.0. \]

#### **Step 5: Match the result with the answer choices**
The length of \( EC \) is 3.0. Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 1 cm
- B: 2 cm
- C: 3 cm
- D: 4 cm

The correct answer is \( C \).

### Final Answer:
