### Problem Analysis:
We are given a circle with center \( O \) and radius 5. Triangle \( ABC \) is inscribed in the circle, with \( \angle C = 30^\circ \). Point \( P \) is another point on the circle such that in triangle \( ABP \), \( PB = AB \). We need to find the length of \( PA \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- Circle \( O \) has radius 5.
- \( \angle C = 30^\circ \).
- \( PB = AB \) in triangle \( ABP \).
- We need to find the length of \( PA \).

#### **Step 2: Use properties of the circle and inscribed angles**
Since \( \angle C = 30^\circ \), we can use the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts. Therefore, the arc \( AB \) intercepted by \( \angle C \) has a measure of \( 2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ \).

#### **Step 3: Determine the central angle subtended by arc \( AB \)**
The central angle \( \angle AOB \) subtended by arc \( AB \) is equal to the measure of the arc, which is \( 60^\circ \). Thus, \( \angle AOB = 60^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Use the properties of triangle \( AOB \)**
Triangle \( AOB \) is isosceles with \( OA = OB = 5 \) (the radius of the circle). Since \( \angle AOB = 60^\circ \), triangle \( AOB \) is an equilateral triangle. Therefore, all sides of \( \triangle AOB \) are equal:
\[ AB = OA = OB = 5. \]

#### **Step 5: Analyze triangle \( ABP \)**
We are given that \( PB = AB \). Since \( AB = 5 \), it follows that \( PB = 5 \). Therefore, triangle \( ABP \) is isosceles with \( PB = AB = 5 \).

#### **Step 6: Use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABP \)**
To find the length of \( PA \), we use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABP \). Let \( PA = x \). Since \( PB = AB = 5 \) and \( \angle ABP = 60^\circ \) (as \( \angle AOB = 60^\circ \) and \( P \) is on the circle), we have:
\[
PA^2 = AB^2 + PB^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot PB \cdot \cos(\angle ABP).
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
x^2 = 5^2 + 5^2 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot \cos(60^\circ).
\]
Since \( \cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} \), we get:
\[
x^2 = 25 + 25 - 2 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 25 + 25 - 25 = 25.
\]
Thus,
\[
x^2 = 25 \implies x = 5.
\]

#### **Step 7: Verify the result**
The calculation shows that \( PA = 5 \). This is consistent with the symmetry and properties of the circle and the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
