### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed in circle \( O \). The measure of \( \angle ABC \) is given as \( 70^\circ \), and we need to find the measure of \( \angle AOC \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   - Since \( \triangle ABC \) is inscribed in circle \( O \), \( O \) is the center of the circle.
   - \( \angle AOC \) is a central angle subtended by the arc \( AC \).
   - \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc \( AC \).

2. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Relationship:**
   - A key property of circles is that the measure of a central angle is twice the measure of an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.
   - Mathematically, if \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle subtended by arc \( AC \), then:
     \[
     \angle AOC = 2 \times \angle ABC
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Value:**
   - We are given \( \angle ABC = 70^\circ \).
   - Using the relationship:
     \[
     \angle AOC = 2 \times 70^\circ = 140^\circ
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \( \angle AOC \) is \( 140^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
