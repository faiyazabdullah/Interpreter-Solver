### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The image shows four concentric circles with radii 1, 2, 3, and 4. These circles form two shaded rings and two white rings. The goal is to find the ratio of the area of the small shaded ring to the area of the large shaded ring.

#### **Step 2: Define the Rings**
- **Small shaded ring**: The region between the circle of radius 2 and the circle of radius 1.
- **Large shaded ring**: The region between the circle of radius 4 and the circle of radius 3.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Area of Each Ring**
The area of a ring (annulus) is the difference between the areas of the outer and inner circles. The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \pi r^2
\]

##### **Area of the Small Shaded Ring**
- Outer radius: 2
- Inner radius: 1
\[
\text{Area of the small shaded ring} = \pi (2^2) - \pi (1^2) = \pi (4) - \pi (1) = 3\pi
\]

##### **Area of the Large Shaded Ring**
- Outer radius: 4
- Inner radius: 3
\[
\text{Area of the large shaded ring} = \pi (4^2) - \pi (3^2) = \pi (16) - \pi (9) = 7\pi
\]

#### **Step 4: Find the Ratio of the Areas**
The ratio of the area of the small shaded ring to the area of the large shaded ring is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Area of the small shaded ring}}{\text{Area of the large shaded ring}} = \frac{3\pi}{7\pi} = \frac{3}{7}
\]

#### **Step 5: Match the Ratio to the Answer Choices**
The ratio \( \frac{3}{7} \) corresponds to the choice **D**.

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
