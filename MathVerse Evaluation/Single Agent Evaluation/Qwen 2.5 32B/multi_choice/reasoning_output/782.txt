### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **1. Analyze the given information:**
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \).
- Point \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AB \), so \( AE = EB \).
- Point \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), so \( AD = DC \).
- \( AE = x \).
- \( ED = 4 \).

#### **2. Use the Midsegment Theorem:**
The Midsegment Theorem states that the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. Here, \( DE \) is the midsegment of \( \triangle ABC \) because \( E \) and \( D \) are the midpoints of \( AB \) and \( AC \), respectively. Therefore:
\[ DE \parallel BC \]
\[ DE = \frac{1}{2} BC \]

#### **3. Relate the given lengths:**
We are given that \( ED = 4 \). According to the Midsegment Theorem:
\[ DE = \frac{1}{2} BC \]
Thus:
\[ 4 = \frac{1}{2} BC \]

#### **4. Solve for \( BC \):**
Multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate \( BC \):
\[ BC = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

#### **5. Verify the relationship with \( x \):**
Since \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AB \) and \( AE = x \), it follows that \( AB = 2x \). Similarly, since \( D \) is the midpoint of \( AC \) and \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), we have \( AC = 2x \). The midsegment theorem confirms that \( DE \) is half the length of \( BC \), and the calculation \( BC = 8 \) is consistent with the given \( ED = 4 \).

#### **6. Compare with the answer choices:**
The length of \( BC \) is \( 8 \). This matches option B.

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{B} \]
