### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- Quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is given.
- \(E\) and \(F\) are the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AD\) respectively.
- \(EF = 2.0\).
- \(BC = 5.0\).
- \(CD = 3.0\).

We need to find \(\tan C\).

#### **Step 2: Use the Midpoint Theorem**
The Midpoint Theorem states that the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and half its length. 

In this problem, since \(E\) and \(F\) are midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AD\) respectively, \(EF\) is parallel to \(BD\) and:
\[
EF = \frac{1}{2} BD
\]
Given \(EF = 2.0\), we can solve for \(BD\):
\[
BD = 2 \cdot EF = 2 \cdot 2 = 4
\]

#### **Step 3: Identify the triangle involving \(\tan C\)** 
We are interested in \(\tan C\) in \(\triangle BCD\). To find \(\tan C\), we need the lengths of the sides adjacent to angle \(C\), which are \(BC\) and \(CD\), and the relationship between these sides.

From the given information:
- \(BC = 5.0\)
- \(CD = 3.0\)
- \(BD = 4.0\)

#### **Step 4: Check if \(\triangle BCD\) is a right triangle**
To determine if \(\triangle BCD\) is a right triangle, we use the Pythagorean theorem. For a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, \(BC\) (the longest side) could be the hypotenuse:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
5^2 = 4^2 + 3^2
\]
\[
25 = 16 + 9
\]
\[
25 = 25
\]
This confirms that \(\triangle BCD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle BDC = 90^\circ\).

#### **Step 5: Calculate \(\tan C\)**
In a right triangle, \(\tan C\) is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side:
\[
\tan C = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
Here, the side opposite to \(\angle C\) is \(BD = 4\), and the side adjacent to \(\angle C\) is \(CD = 3\):
\[
\tan C = \frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

#### **Step 6: Match the answer with the given choices**
The calculated value of \(\tan C\) is \(\frac{4}{3}\). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \(\frac{3}{4}\)
- B: \(\frac{4}{3}\)
- C: \(\frac{3}{5}\)
- D: \(\frac{4}{5}\)

The correct choice is \(B\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
