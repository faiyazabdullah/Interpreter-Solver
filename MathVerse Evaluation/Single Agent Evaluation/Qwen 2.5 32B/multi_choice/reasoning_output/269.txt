### Problem Analysis:
We are given two similar polygons. The first polygon has vertices \( R, S, T, U, V \), and the second polygon has vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \). The goal is to find the length of \( UT \) using the given information and the similarity of the polygons.

#### Given Information:
1. **Polygon \( RSTUV \)**:
   - \( RT = 18 \) m
   - \( RV = x \) m
   - \( TU = (y + 2) \) m

2. **Polygon \( ABEDC \)**:
   - \( AE = 3 \) m
   - \( CD = 5 \) m
   - \( BC = 4 \) m

3. The two polygons are similar, meaning their corresponding sides are proportional.

#### Objective:
Find the length of \( UT \).

---

### Step 1: Identify Corresponding Sides
Since the polygons are similar, we can match the corresponding sides:
- \( RT \) corresponds to \( AE \).
- \( RV \) corresponds to \( AB \).
- \( TU \) corresponds to \( CD \).
- \( UV \) corresponds to \( DE \).

From the problem, we know:
- \( RT = 18 \) m
- \( AE = 3 \) m
- \( CD = 5 \) m

The ratio of similarity between the two polygons is given by the ratio of corresponding sides. Using \( RT \) and \( AE \):
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{RT}{AE} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
\]

This means every side of the larger polygon \( RSTUV \) is 6 times the corresponding side of the smaller polygon \( ABEDC \).

---

### Step 2: Use the Ratio to Find \( TU \)
The side \( TU \) in the larger polygon corresponds to the side \( CD \) in the smaller polygon. Using the similarity ratio:
\[
TU = 6 \times CD
\]
Substitute \( CD = 5 \) m:
\[
TU = 6 \times 5 = 30 \text{ m}
\]

However, the problem states \( TU = (y + 2) \). Therefore:
\[
y + 2 = 30
\]
Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 30 - 2 = 28
\]

Thus, the length of \( TU \) is:
\[
TU = y + 2 = 28 + 2 = 30 \text{ m}
\]

---

### Step 3: Verify and Select the Correct Answer
The calculated length of \( TU \) is 30 m. However, this does not match any of the provided answer choices. Upon re-evaluating the problem, it appears there might be a misinterpretation or error in the question's setup or answer choices. Given the options:
- A: 12
- B: 20.5
- C: 22.5
- D: 35

The closest value to our calculated result (30) is **22.5**.

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
