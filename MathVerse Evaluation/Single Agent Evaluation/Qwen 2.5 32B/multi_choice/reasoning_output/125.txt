### Problem Analysis:
We are given a sector of a circle with:
- Radius \( OA = OB = 30 \) cm.
- Central angle \( \angle AOB = 120^\circ \).

This sector is used to form a conical chimney cap by joining the radii \( OA \) and \( OB \). We need to find the radius of the base circle of the resulting cone.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometry**
When the sector is folded into a cone:
- The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base circle of the cone.
- The radius \( OA \) (or \( OB \)) becomes the slant height of the cone.

#### **Step 2: Calculate the Arc Length of the Sector**
The arc length \( L \) of a sector with radius \( r \) and central angle \( \theta \) (in degrees) is given by:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi r
\]
Here, \( r = 30 \) cm and \( \theta = 120^\circ \). Substituting these values:
\[
L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi \cdot 30 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2\pi \cdot 30 = 20\pi \text{ cm}
\]

#### **Step 3: Relate the Arc Length to the Cone's Base Circumference**
When the sector is folded into a cone, the arc length \( L \) becomes the circumference of the base circle of the cone. Let \( R \) be the radius of the base circle of the cone. The circumference of the base circle is given by:
\[
2\pi R
\]
Equating this to the arc length \( L \):
\[
2\pi R = 20\pi
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( R \)**
Divide both sides by \( 2\pi \):
\[
R = \frac{20\pi}{2\pi} = 10 \text{ cm}
\]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Solution**
The radius \( R \) of the base circle of the cone is indeed 10 cm, as derived from the relationship between the arc length of the sector and the circumference of the base circle.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
