====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

#### Step 1: Examine the Geometric Figure
The image shows a vertical line passing through the point \((6, 0)\). This line is parallel to the \(y\)-axis.

#### Step 2: Understand the Given Information
- The line is described as being **parallel to the \(y\)-axis**.
- The line passes through the point \((6, 0)\).

#### Step 3: Identify What Needs to Be Found
We need to determine the **slope** of the line.

#### Step 4: Apply Relevant Geometric Properties
1. **Definition of Slope**: The slope of a line is defined as the change in \(y\) divided by the change in \(x\) (\(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)).
2. **Vertical Lines**: A vertical line has no horizontal change (\(\Delta x = 0\)). Since the denominator in the slope formula (\(\Delta x\)) becomes zero, the slope of a vertical line is **undefined**.

#### Step 5: Show Calculations
For a vertical line, consider two points on the line. For example, \((6, 0)\) and \((6, 1)\):
- Change in \(y\): \(\Delta y = 1 - 0 = 1\)
- Change in \(x\): \(\Delta x = 6 - 6 = 0\)

The slope \(m\) is:
\[
m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{1}{0}
\]
Since division by zero is undefined, the slope of the line is **undefined**.

#### Step 6: Compare with Answer Choices
The answer choices are:
A: 0  
B: 1  
C: 6  
D: Undefined  

The correct answer is "Undefined."

#### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
