### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a circle with points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lying on the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle is labeled as \( O \). We are given that \( \angle ABC = 130^\circ \) and are asked to find \( \angle AOC \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Geometric Relationships:**
   - \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle subtended by the arc \( AC \).
   - \( \angle AOC \) is a central angle subtended by the same arc \( AC \).

2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - The Inscribed Angle Theorem states that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc.
   - Mathematically, if \( \angle ABC \) is an inscribed angle and \( \angle AOC \) is the corresponding central angle, then:
     \[
     \angle AOC = 2 \times \angle ABC
     \]

3. **Given Information:**
   - \( \angle ABC = 130^\circ \).

4. **Calculate \( \angle AOC \):**
   - Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
     \[
     \angle AOC = 2 \times \angle ABC = 2 \times 130^\circ = 260^\circ
     \]
   - However, since \( \angle AOC \) is a central angle and the total measure of a full circle is \( 360^\circ \), the reflex angle \( \angle AOC \) would be \( 260^\circ \). But we need the smaller angle formed by the arc \( AC \), which is:
     \[
     360^\circ - 260^\circ = 100^\circ
     \]

5. **Verify the Smaller Central Angle:**
   - The smaller central angle subtended by the arc \( AC \) is indeed \( 100^\circ \).

6. **Compare with Answer Choices:**
   - The calculated value of \( \angle AOC \) is \( 100^\circ \).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: 100°
     - B: 110°
     - C: 120°
     - D: 130°

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
