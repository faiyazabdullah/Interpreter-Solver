To solve the problem, we will analyze the geometric relationships and apply relevant theorems step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- **AB** is the diameter of circle \(O\).
- **C** is a point on the circle.
- **CE** is a tangent to the circle at point \(C\).
- **OD \perp AC** at point \(D\).
- \(\angle E = 30^\circ\).
- \(CE = 6\).

We need to find the length of \(OD\).

### Step 2: Use properties of tangents and circles
Since \(CE\) is a tangent to the circle at \(C\), and \(OC\) is the radius, we know:
\[ OC \perp CE. \]
This means \(\angle OCE = 90^\circ\).

### Step 3: Determine \(\angle COE\)
In \(\triangle OCE\):
- \(\angle OCE = 90^\circ\).
- \(\angle E = 30^\circ\).

Using the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is \(180^\circ\):
\[ \angle COE = 180^\circ - \angle OCE - \angle E = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 30^\circ = 60^\circ. \]

### Step 4: Use the right triangle \(OCE\)
In \(\triangle OCE\), we have:
- \(\angle OCE = 90^\circ\).
- \(\angle E = 30^\circ\).
- \(\angle COE = 60^\circ\).

This is a 30-60-90 triangle. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\). Here:
- \(CE\) is the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle.
- \(OC\) is the side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle.
- \(OE\) is the hypotenuse.

Given \(CE = 6\), which is the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle, the side opposite the \(60^\circ\) angle (which is \(OC\)) is:
\[ OC = CE \cdot \sqrt{3} = 6 \cdot \sqrt{3}/2 = 3\sqrt{3}. \]

However, since \(OC\) is the radius of the circle, we need to re-evaluate the scale. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the shortest side. Therefore:
\[ OE = 2 \cdot CE/2 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6. \]
\[ OC = 3. \]

### Step 5: Use the perpendicular from the center to the chord
Since \(OD \perp AC\) and \(O\) is the center, \(D\) is the midpoint of \(AC\). This means \(AD = DC\).

In \(\triangle ODC\):
- \(OD\) is the altitude from \(O\) to \(AC\).
- \(\angle ODC = 90^\circ\).
- \(\angle DOC = \frac{1}{2} \angle COE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 60^\circ = 30^\circ\).

In \(\triangle ODC\), which is a right triangle:
- \(OC = 3\) (radius of the circle).
- \(\angle DOC = 30^\circ\).
- \(\angle ODC = 90^\circ\).

Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle:
\[ OD = OC \cdot \cos(30^\circ) = 3 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2}. \]

However, we need to re-evaluate the scale. Since \(OC = 3\), and \(OD\) is the altitude in the right triangle, we have:
\[ OD = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5. \]

But the correct approach is to use the fact that \(OD\) is the altitude in the right triangle, and the correct value is:
\[ OD = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5. \]

### Step 6: Correct the value
The correct value is:
\[ OD = \sqrt{3}. \]

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
