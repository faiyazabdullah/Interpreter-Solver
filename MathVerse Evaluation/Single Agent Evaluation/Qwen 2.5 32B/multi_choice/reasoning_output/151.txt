### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric setup where a student observes a tree and its reflection in the water. The key elements provided are:
- The student's height: \(1.7\) meters.
- The distance from the student to the base of the tree: \(20.0\) meters.
- The distance from the student to the reflection of the tree's top in the water: \(5.0\) meters.
- We need to find the height of the tree.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### 1. **Understanding the Reflection Geometry**:
   - The reflection of the tree's top in the water creates a virtual image that appears to be at the same horizontal distance below the water surface as the tree's top is above it.
   - Let the height of the tree be \(H\) meters.
   - The total vertical distance from the student's eye level to the top of the tree is \(H - 1.7\) meters (since the student's height is \(1.7\) meters).
   - The reflection of the tree's top is symmetric about the water surface, so the virtual image of the tree's top is also \(H - 1.7\) meters below the water surface.

#### 2. **Similar Triangles**:
   - Consider the triangle formed by the student, the tree, and the line of sight to the top of the tree.
   - Consider the triangle formed by the student, the reflection of the tree's top, and the line of sight to the reflection.
   - These two triangles are similar because the angles are the same (corresponding angles due to the parallel nature of the water surface and the vertical height of the tree).

#### 3. **Setting Up the Proportions**:
   - Let the height of the tree be \(H\).
   - The height difference between the student's eye level and the top of the tree is \(H - 1.7\).
   - The distance from the student to the tree is \(20.0\) meters.
   - The distance from the student to the reflection of the tree's top is \(5.0\) meters.
   - By the properties of similar triangles, the ratio of the heights is equal to the ratio of the distances:
     \[
     \frac{H - 1.7}{1.7} = \frac{20}{5}
     \]

#### 4. **Solving the Proportion**:
   - Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{H - 1.7}{1.7} = 4
     \]
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \(H\):
     \[
     H - 1.7 = 4 \times 1.7
     \]
     \[
     H - 1.7 = 6.8
     \]
     \[
     H = 6.8 + 1.7
     \]
     \[
     H = 8.5
     \]

#### 5. **Conclusion**:
   - The height of the tree is \(8.5\) meters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
