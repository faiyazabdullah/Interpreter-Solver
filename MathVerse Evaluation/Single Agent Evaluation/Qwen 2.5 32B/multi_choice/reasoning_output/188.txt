====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric figure step by step and use relevant theorems and properties.

### Step 1: Understand the Given Information
- **Circle O**: Centered at \( O \).
- **Tangent Line**: \( BA \) is tangent to the circle at point \( A \).
- **Angle**: \( \angle B = 45^\circ \).
- **Length**: \( AB = 2 \).

We need to find the length of \( BC \), where \( OB \) intersects the circle at point \( C \).

### Step 2: Use Geometric Properties
Since \( BA \) is tangent to the circle at \( A \), and \( OA \) is the radius of the circle, we know that:
\[ OA \perp BA. \]
This means \( \angle OAB = 90^\circ \).

### Step 3: Define Variables and Relationships
Let the radius of the circle be \( r \). Therefore:
- \( OA = r \).
- \( OB \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( OAB \).

In \( \triangle OAB \):
- \( \angle OAB = 90^\circ \).
- \( \angle B = 45^\circ \).
- \( \angle AOB = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 45^\circ = 45^\circ \).

Thus, \( \triangle OAB \) is a 45-45-90 triangle. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : 1 : \sqrt{2} \). Specifically:
- The legs are equal.
- The hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{2} \) times the length of each leg.

### Step 4: Calculate the Radius \( r \)
Since \( AB = 2 \) and \( \triangle OAB \) is a 45-45-90 triangle:
\[ AB = r\sqrt{2}. \]
Given \( AB = 2 \):
\[ r\sqrt{2} = 2. \]
Solving for \( r \):
\[ r = \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}. \]

### Step 5: Determine the Length of \( OB \)
In \( \triangle OAB \), \( OB \) is the hypotenuse:
\[ OB = r\sqrt{2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2. \]

### Step 6: Find the Length of \( BC \)
Since \( C \) is the point where \( OB \) intersects the circle, \( OC = r = \sqrt{2} \). Therefore:
\[ BC = OB - OC = 2 - \sqrt{2}. \]

### Final Answer:
The length of \( BC \) is \( 2 - \sqrt{2} \).

Final Answer: D
