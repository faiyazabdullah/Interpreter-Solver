QUESTION:
On 27.0 2009.0, 10.0, 2009, Shanghai team player Wu Di came to the fore in the National Games and defeated the top-seeded men's singles player Zeng Shaoxuan with a score of 2.0:0.0, and won the men's singles championship in tennis at the National Games. The picture below is a ball played by Wu Di in the final. It is known that the net height is 0.8, and the horizontal distance from the hitting point to the net is 4.0. When the ball is played, the ball can hit the net and the landing point is exactly 6.0 away from the net. Then the height h of the racket hit is ()

CHOICES:
A:\frac{8}{5}米
B:\frac{4}{3}米
C:1米
D:\frac{8}{15}米

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the geometric relationships described in the image and use similar triangles to find the height \( h \) at which the racket hit the ball.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The net height is \( 0.8 \) meters.
- The horizontal distance from the hitting point to the net is \( 4.0 \) meters.
- The horizontal distance from the net to the landing point is \( 6.0 \) meters.
- The ball hits the net at a height of \( 0.8 \) meters and lands at a height of \( 0 \) meters (ground level).

We need to determine the height \( h \) at which the racket hit the ball.

### Step 2: Set up the geometric model
Let's denote:
- The hitting point as \( P \) with coordinates \( (0, h) \).
- The net as a vertical line at \( x = 4 \) with height \( 0.8 \).
- The landing point as \( Q \) with coordinates \( (10, 0) \).

The path of the ball forms a straight line from \( P \) to \( Q \). This line intersects the net at \( x = 4 \) at a height of \( 0.8 \) meters.

### Step 3: Use similar triangles
The key idea is to use the property of similar triangles. The triangle formed by the hitting point, the net, and the point where the ball hits the net is similar to the triangle formed by the hitting point, the net, and the landing point.

#### Triangle 1: From the hitting point to the net
- Base: \( 4 \) meters (horizontal distance from \( P \) to the net).
- Height: \( h - 0.8 \) meters (vertical distance from the hitting height \( h \) to the net height \( 0.8 \)).

#### Triangle 2: From the hitting point to the landing point
- Base: \( 10 \) meters (total horizontal distance from \( P \) to \( Q \)).
- Height: \( h \) meters (vertical distance from the hitting height \( h \) to the ground).

Since these triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of Triangle 1}}{\text{Base of Triangle 1}} = \frac{\text{Height of Triangle 2}}{\text{Base of Triangle 2}}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{h - 0.8}{4} = \frac{h}{10}
\]

### Step 4: Solve the equation
Cross-multiply to solve for \( h \):
\[
10(h - 0.8) = 4h
\]
\[
10h - 8 = 4h
\]
\[
10h - 4h = 8
\]
\[
6h = 8
\]
\[
h = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

### Step 5: Verify the solution
The height \( h = \frac{4}{3} \) meters satisfies the condition that the ball hits the net at \( 0.8 \) meters and lands at \( 0 \) meters. The similar triangles confirm the proportionality.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
