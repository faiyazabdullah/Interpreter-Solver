### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the given information**
- The straight line \( AD \) is parallel to the straight line \( BC \).
- \( \angle 1 = 42^\circ \).
- \( \angle BAC = 78^\circ \).
- We need to find the measure of \( \angle 2 \).

#### **Step 2: Identify key geometric relationships**
Since \( AD \parallel BC \), we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals:
- Corresponding angles are equal.
- Alternate interior angles are equal.
- Consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) are supplementary.

#### **Step 3: Analyze the angles involving \( \angle 1 \) and \( \angle BAC \)**
- \( \angle 1 \) is an exterior angle for triangle \( ABC \). According to the exterior angle theorem, the measure of an exterior angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
- Therefore, \( \angle 1 = \angle BAC + \angle ACB \).
- Substituting the given values:
  \[
  \angle 1 = \angle BAC + \angle ACB \implies 42^\circ = 78^\circ + \angle ACB.
  \]
- Solving for \( \angle ACB \):
  \[
  \angle ACB = 42^\circ - 78^\circ = -36^\circ.
  \]
  This calculation seems incorrect because angles cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the setup.

#### **Step 4: Correct interpretation using parallel lines**
Since \( AD \parallel BC \), the angle \( \angle 2 \) is related to the angles in the triangle and the parallel lines. Specifically:
- \( \angle 2 \) is an alternate interior angle to \( \angle BAC \) when considering the transversal \( AB \).
- However, we need to consider the supplementary relationship between \( \angle 2 \) and the angles formed by the parallel lines.

#### **Step 5: Use the supplementary property**
- The angle \( \angle 2 \) is supplementary to the angle formed by the transversal \( AB \) and the parallel lines \( AD \) and \( BC \).
- The angle adjacent to \( \angle 2 \) (on the same side of the transversal) is \( 180^\circ - \angle BAC \).
- Since \( \angle BAC = 78^\circ \), the supplementary angle is:
  \[
  180^\circ - 78^\circ = 102^\circ.
  \]
- Therefore, \( \angle 2 \) is the difference between \( 102^\circ \) and \( \angle 1 \):
  \[
  \angle 2 = 102^\circ - 42^\circ = 60^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 6: Verify the solution**
- The angle \( \angle 2 \) is correctly calculated as \( 60^\circ \) based on the properties of parallel lines and the given angles.

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
