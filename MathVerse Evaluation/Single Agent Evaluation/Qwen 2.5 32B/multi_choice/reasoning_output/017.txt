### Problem Analysis:
We are given a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersecting at point \(O\). The problem specifies:
- \(\angle DAC = 42^\circ\)
- \(\angle CBD = 23^\circ\)

We need to find \(\angle COD\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Properties of a Parallelogram
In a parallelogram:
1. Opposite sides are parallel.
2. Diagonals bisect each other.
3. Opposite angles are equal.
4. Consecutive angles are supplementary.

#### Step 2: Use the Given Angles
- \(\angle DAC = 42^\circ\): This is an angle formed by diagonal \(AC\) and side \(AD\).
- \(\angle CBD = 23^\circ\): This is an angle formed by diagonal \(BD\) and side \(BC\).

Since \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram, we know that:
- \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AD \parallel BC\).

#### Step 3: Analyze the Intersection of Diagonals
The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, point \(O\) is the midpoint of both diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

#### Step 4: Use Alternate Interior Angles
In a parallelogram, alternate interior angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines are equal. Specifically:
- Since \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(BD\) is a transversal, \(\angle DAC = \angle BCA = 42^\circ\).
- Similarly, since \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(AC\) is a transversal, \(\angle CBD = \angle BDC = 23^\circ\).

#### Step 5: Calculate \(\angle COD\)
The angle \(\angle COD\) is the angle formed by the intersection of diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) at point \(O\). To find \(\angle COD\), we use the fact that the sum of angles around point \(O\) is \(360^\circ\).

At point \(O\), the angles formed by the diagonals can be analyzed as follows:
- \(\angle COD\) is part of the triangle \(COD\).
- The angles \(\angle OCB\) and \(\angle ODC\) are given by the properties of the parallelogram:
  - \(\angle OCB = \angle BCA = 42^\circ\) (alternate interior angles).
  - \(\angle ODC = \angle BDC = 23^\circ\) (alternate interior angles).

In \(\triangle COD\):
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is \(180^\circ\).
- Therefore, \(\angle COD = 180^\circ - (\angle OCB + \angle ODC)\).

Substitute the known values:
\[
\angle COD = 180^\circ - (42^\circ + 23^\circ) = 180^\circ - 65^\circ = 115^\circ.
\]

However, \(\angle COD\) is the vertical angle to the angle formed by the diagonals, and vertical angles are equal. Thus, the angle we are looking for is the supplement of \(115^\circ\):
\[
\angle COD = 180^\circ - 115^\circ = 65^\circ.
\]

#### Step 6: Verify the Calculation
The calculation is consistent with the properties of a parallelogram and the given angles. The angle \(\angle COD\) is indeed \(65^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
