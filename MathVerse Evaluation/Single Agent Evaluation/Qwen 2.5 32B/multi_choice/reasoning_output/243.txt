QUESTION:
A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix with a distance 110x + 53, on to Atlanta with a distance 150x + 91, and back to Des Moines with a distance 73.8x, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.

CHOICES:
A:53
B:73.8
C:110
D:1591

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The problem involves a triangular path traced by a plane traveling from Des Moines to Phoenix, then to Atlanta, and finally back to Des Moines. The distances between these cities are given as algebraic expressions in terms of \( x \):
- Distance from Des Moines to Phoenix: \( 110x + 53 \)
- Distance from Phoenix to Atlanta: \( 150x + 91 \)
- Distance from Atlanta to Des Moines: \( 73.8x \)

We are asked to find the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which is represented by \( 150x + 91 \). The total distance traveled in the trip is given as 3482 miles.

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Equation for the Total Distance**
The total distance traveled is the sum of the three segments of the trip:
\[
(110x + 53) + (150x + 91) + (73.8x) = 3482
\]

#### **Step 3: Combine Like Terms**
Combine the coefficients of \( x \) and the constant terms separately:
\[
110x + 150x + 73.8x + 53 + 91 = 3482
\]
\[
(110 + 150 + 73.8)x + (53 + 91) = 3482
\]
\[
333.8x + 144 = 3482
\]

#### **Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
Isolate \( x \) by first subtracting 144 from both sides:
\[
333.8x = 3482 - 144
\]
\[
333.8x = 3338
\]

Next, divide both sides by 333.8:
\[
x = \frac{3338}{333.8}
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

#### **Step 5: Calculate the Distance from Phoenix to Atlanta**
Now that we have \( x = 10 \), substitute this value into the expression for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta:
\[
150x + 91 = 150(10) + 91
\]
\[
150x + 91 = 1500 + 91
\]
\[
150x + 91 = 1591
\]

#### **Step 6: Verify the Calculation**
The distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is \( 1591 \) miles. This matches the total trip distance when substituted back into the original equation:
\[
(110(10) + 53) + (150(10) + 91) + (73.8(10)) = 1153 + 1591 + 738 = 3482
\]
The calculation is consistent with the given total distance.

#### **Step 7: Match with Answer Choices**
The distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is \( 1591 \) miles. Comparing this with the answer choices:
- A: 53
- B: 73.8
- C: 110
- D: 1591

The correct answer is \( D \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
