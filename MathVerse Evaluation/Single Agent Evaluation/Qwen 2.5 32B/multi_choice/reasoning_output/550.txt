QUESTION:
Elena knows that Lea has a garden with an area of 100 square meters. She does not know the specific width, $w$, and length, $l$ of the garden. The graph below represents the widths that correspond to possible lengths of Lea's garden, which decreases when $w$ increases and goes through (5,20), (10,10), (20,5). As the possible width of Lea's garden increases, what does its possible length approach?

CHOICES:
A:$\infty$
B:$\hline 0$
C:$\hline 10$
D:$\hline 120$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's carefully analyze the given information and the graph step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We are given that Lea's garden has an area of **100 square meters**. The relationship between the width ($w$) and length ($l$) of the garden is such that their product is constant:
$$
w \cdot l = 100.
$$
This means that as the width $w$ increases, the length $l$ decreases, and vice versa.

The graph provided shows the relationship between $w$ and $l$. Key points on the graph include:
- $(5, 20)$: When $w = 5$, $l = 20$.
- $(10, 10)$: When $w = 10$, $l = 10$.
- $(20, 5)$: When $w = 20$, $l = 5$.

### Step 2: Analyze the Graph
The graph shows that as $w$ increases, $l$ decreases. This is consistent with the equation $w \cdot l = 100$. The curve approaches the horizontal axis as $w$ becomes very large. Mathematically, as $w \to \infty$, $l \to 0$ because:
$$
l = \frac{100}{w}.
$$
When $w$ is extremely large, the value of $l$ becomes extremely small but never reaches zero.

### Step 3: Determine the Limiting Behavior
From the equation $l = \frac{100}{w}$, we can see that as $w$ approaches infinity, $l$ approaches zero. This is evident from the graph as well, where the curve gets closer and closer to the horizontal axis (the $w$-axis) as $w$ increases.

### Step 4: Match with Answer Choices
The question asks what the possible length $l$ approaches as the width $w$ increases. Based on our analysis:
- As $w \to \infty$, $l \to 0$.

Thus, the correct answer is:
$$
\text{Final Answer: B}
$$
