QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Analysis of the Problem:

1. **Identify the Given Information**:
   - Straight lines \( a \) and \( b \) intersect at point \( O \).
   - Angle 1 is given as \( 50^\circ \).

2. **Understand the Geometric Relationships**:
   - When two lines intersect, they form four angles. These angles can be classified into pairs of:
     - **Vertical Angles**: Opposite angles formed by the intersection.
     - **Adjacent Angles**: Angles that share a common vertex and side but do not overlap.
   - Vertical angles are always equal.
   - Adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).

3. **Identify the Relationship Between Angle 1 and Angle 2**:
   - Angle 1 and Angle 2 are adjacent angles because they share the vertex \( O \) and the side \( a \).
   - Since they are adjacent, their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).

4. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( \text{Angle 2} = x \).
   - According to the property of supplementary angles:
     \[
     \text{Angle 1} + \text{Angle 2} = 180^\circ
     \]
   - Substituting the given value for Angle 1:
     \[
     50^\circ + x = 180^\circ
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
   \]

6. **Compare with the Answer Choices**:
   - The calculated value of Angle 2 is \( 130^\circ \).
   - The answer choices are:
     - A: \( 50^\circ \)
     - B: \( 40^\circ \)
     - C: \( 140^\circ \)
     - D: \( 130^\circ \)

7. **Select the Correct Answer**:
   - The correct answer matches option D.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
