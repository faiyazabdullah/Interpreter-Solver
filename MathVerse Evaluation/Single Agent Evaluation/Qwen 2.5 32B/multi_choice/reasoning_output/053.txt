### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves two parallel lines \(a\) and \(b\), and a transversal line \(c\) intersecting both lines. We are given that \(\angle 1 = 55^\circ\) and need to find \(\angle 2\).

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Relationships
- Since \(a \parallel b\), the transversal \(c\) creates corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles.
- \(\angle 1\) is formed by the intersection of \(c\) with line \(a\).
- \(\angle 2\) is formed by the intersection of \(c\) with line \(b\).

#### Step 2: Identify the Relationship Between \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\)
- Because \(a \parallel b\), \(\angle 1\) and \(\angle 2\) are **consecutive interior angles** (also known as same-side interior angles). Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning their sum is \(180^\circ\).
- Mathematically, this relationship can be expressed as:
  \[
  \angle 1 + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 3: Substitute the Given Value
- We are given that \(\angle 1 = 55^\circ\). Substituting this into the equation:
  \[
  55^\circ + \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 4: Solve for \(\angle 2\)
- Isolate \(\angle 2\) by subtracting \(55^\circ\) from both sides:
  \[
  \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 55^\circ = 125^\circ
  \]

#### Step 5: Compare with the Answer Choices
- The calculated value of \(\angle 2\) is \(125^\circ\).
- The answer choices are:
  - A: \(55^\circ\)
  - B: \(35^\circ\)
  - C: \(125^\circ\)
  - D: \(65^\circ\)

#### Final Answer:
The correct answer is \(125^\circ\), which corresponds to choice C.

Final Answer: C
