### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The triangle is isosceles with two equal sides, each of length 32.
- The base angle is given as \(54^\circ\).
- The height \(y\) is drawn from the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base, forming two right triangles.
- We need to find the length of the base \(x\), and it is stated that \(x\) is half of the base. Therefore, we first find the full base length and then divide it by 2.

#### **Step 2: Understand the geometry**
- In an isosceles triangle, the height \(y\) bisects the base into two equal segments. Let the full base be \(2b\). Then \(x = b\).
- Each right triangle formed by the height has:
  - Hypotenuse = 32 (one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle),
  - One leg = \(b\) (half of the base),
  - The other leg = \(y\) (the height),
  - The angle between the hypotenuse and the base is \(54^\circ\).

#### **Step 3: Use trigonometry to find \(b\)** 
- In the right triangle, the cosine of the base angle (\(54^\circ\)) relates the adjacent side (half the base, \(b\)) to the hypotenuse (32):
  \[
  \cos(54^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{b}{32}
  \]
- Solving for \(b\):
  \[
  b = 32 \cdot \cos(54^\circ)
  \]

#### **Step 4: Calculate \(b\)** 
- Using the value of \(\cos(54^\circ)\):
  \[
  \cos(54^\circ) \approx 0.5878
  \]
  \[
  b = 32 \cdot 0.5878 \approx 18.81
  \]

#### **Step 5: Determine \(x\)** 
- Since \(x\) is half of the base, and we have found \(b\) (which is half of the base), we have:
  \[
  x = b \approx 18.81
  \]

#### **Step 6: Round to the nearest tenth**
- Rounding \(18.81\) to the nearest tenth gives:
  \[
  x \approx 18.8
  \]

#### **Step 7: Match with the answer choices**
- The calculated value \(x \approx 18.8\) matches choice A.
