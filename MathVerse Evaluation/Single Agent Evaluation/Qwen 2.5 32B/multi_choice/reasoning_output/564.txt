QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function going through (0,7), (-4,7) with a vertex (-2,3). f(x)=4(x-5)^2+2. Which function has a greater minimum?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ has a greater minimum than $g$.
B:$g$ has a greater minimum than $f$.
C:$f$ and $g$ share the same minimum.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given functions \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) and compare their minimum values.

### Step 1: Analyze the function \( g(x) \)
From the graph:
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \( (-2, 3) \).
- The function passes through the points \( (0, 7) \) and \( (-4, 7) \).

Since \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function, its general form is:
\[
g(x) = a(x + 2)^2 + 3
\]
where the vertex form \( (h, k) \) is \( (-2, 3) \). Here, \( h = -2 \) and \( k = 3 \).

Using the point \( (0, 7) \):
\[
g(0) = a(0 + 2)^2 + 3 = 7
\]
\[
4a + 3 = 7
\]
\[
4a = 4
\]
\[
a = 1
\]
Thus, the equation for \( g(x) \) is:
\[
g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 3
\]

The minimum value of \( g(x) \) occurs at the vertex, which is \( 3 \).

### Step 2: Analyze the function \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) \) is given as:
\[
f(x) = 4(x - 5)^2 + 2
\]
This is already in vertex form \( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \( h = 5 \) and \( k = 2 \). The vertex is at \( (5, 2) \).

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs at the vertex, which is \( 2 \).

### Step 3: Compare the minimum values
- The minimum value of \( g(x) \) is \( 3 \).
- The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( 2 \).

Since \( 3 > 2 \), the function \( g(x) \) has a greater minimum than \( f(x) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
