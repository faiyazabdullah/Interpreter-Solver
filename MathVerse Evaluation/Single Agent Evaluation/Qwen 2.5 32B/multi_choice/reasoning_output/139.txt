QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, Xiaoqiang made a small hole imaging device in which the length of the paper tube is 15.0. He prepared a candle with a length of 20.0. To get an image with a height of 4.0, the distance between the candle and the paper tube should be ()

CHOICES:
A:60cm
B:65cm
C:70cm
D:75cm

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric relationships and use the principles of similar triangles. Here's the step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The image shows a small hole imaging device, where light passes through a pinhole to form an inverted image of a candle. The key elements are:
- Length of the paper tube (distance from the pinhole to the screen): \( 15.0 \) cm.
- Height of the candle: \( 20.0 \) cm.
- Height of the image formed on the screen: \( 4.0 \) cm.
- Distance between the candle and the paper tube: \( x \) (to be determined).

### Step 2: Identify the Geometric Relationships
The setup forms two similar triangles:
1. The triangle formed by the candle, the pinhole, and the base of the candle.
2. The triangle formed by the image, the pinhole, and the base of the image.

The triangles are similar because the light rays passing through the pinhole create corresponding angles. Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

### Step 3: Set Up the Proportion
Let:
- \( h_1 = 20.0 \) cm (height of the candle),
- \( h_2 = 4.0 \) cm (height of the image),
- \( d_1 = x \) (distance from the candle to the pinhole),
- \( d_2 = 15.0 \) cm (distance from the pinhole to the screen).

From the properties of similar triangles, the ratio of the heights of the candle and its image is equal to the ratio of the distances from the candle and the image to the pinhole:
\[
\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \frac{d_1}{d_2}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{20.0}{4.0} = \frac{x}{15.0}
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{20.0}{4.0} = 5
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
5 = \frac{x}{15.0}
\]

Multiply both sides by 15.0:
\[
x = 5 \times 15.0 = 75.0
\]

### Step 5: Compare with Answer Choices
The calculated value of \( x \) is \( 75.0 \) cm. This matches option D.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
