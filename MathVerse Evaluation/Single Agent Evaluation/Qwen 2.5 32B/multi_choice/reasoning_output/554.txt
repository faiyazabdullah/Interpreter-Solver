QUESTION:
A polynomial $p$ is graphed, which goes through (-2.5,0), (-1,0), (3,0). What could be the equation of $p$ ?

CHOICES:
A:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)^2(x-3)^2$
B:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)(x-3)^2$
C:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)(x-3)$
D:$p(x)=(x+1)(2 x+5)(x-3)^2$

### Analysis of the Problem:
The problem involves determining the equation of a polynomial $ p(x) $ based on its graph and the given roots. The polynomial passes through the points $(-2.5, 0)$, $(-1, 0)$, and $(3, 0)$. These points indicate that $ x = -2.5 $, $ x = -1 $, and $ x = 3 $ are roots of the polynomial.

#### Step 1: Identify the Roots
From the graph and the problem statement:
- The polynomial has roots at $ x = -2.5 $, $ x = -1 $, and $ x = 3 $.
- At $ x = -1 $, the graph touches the x-axis but does not cross it, indicating that $ x = -1 $ is a double root (i.e., $ (x + 1)^2 $).
- At $ x = -2.5 $ and $ x = 3 $, the graph crosses the x-axis, indicating simple roots.

#### Step 2: Express the Polynomial
The general form of the polynomial can be written as:
$$
p(x) = k \cdot (x + 1)^2 \cdot (x + 2.5) \cdot (x - 3)
$$
where $ k $ is a constant. However, since the polynomial is already given in the answer choices without the constant $ k $, we can assume $ k = 1 $ for simplicity.

#### Step 3: Match the Given Answer Choices
Now, we need to rewrite the polynomial in a form that matches one of the given answer choices. Notice that $ x + 2.5 $ can be rewritten as $ 2x + 5 $ by factoring out a 2:
$$
x + 2.5 = \frac{1}{2}(2x + 5)
$$
Thus, the polynomial becomes:
$$
p(x) = (x + 1)^2 \cdot (2x + 5) \cdot (x - 3)
$$

#### Step 4: Compare with Answer Choices
The polynomial $ p(x) = (x + 1)^2 \cdot (2x + 5) \cdot (x - 3) $ matches option **C**:
$$
p(x) = (x + 1)^2 (2x + 5)(x - 3)
$$

#### Final Answer:
After comparing the derived polynomial with the given answer choices, the correct answer is:
$$
\boxed{C}
$$

Final Answer: C
