### Analysis of the Problem:
We are tasked with finding the measure of angle \( \angle 2 \) in the given geometric figure. Let's break down the problem step by step.

#### Step 1: Identify the given information
- The figure contains a right triangle \( \triangle ABF \) and a rectangle \( CDEF \).
- \( \angle BAF = 48^\circ \).
- \( \angle CFD = \angle 2 \).
- \( \angle CDE = 39^\circ \).
- All angles at the corners of the rectangle are right angles (90Â°).

#### Step 2: Understand the relationships
- Since \( \triangle ABF \) is a right triangle, \( \angle ABF = 90^\circ \).
- In a right triangle, the sum of the non-right angles is \( 90^\circ \). Therefore, we can find \( \angle AFB \):
  \[
  \angle AFB = 90^\circ - \angle BAF = 90^\circ - 48^\circ = 42^\circ.
  \]
- In the rectangle \( CDEF \), \( \angle CFD \) is part of the right angle at \( F \). Since \( \angle CFD \) and \( \angle AFB \) are vertically opposite angles (they form a straight line with the right angle at \( F \)), we have:
  \[
  \angle CFD = \angle AFB = 42^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 3: Verify the relationships
- The angle \( \angle CFD \) is directly related to \( \angle AFB \) because they are vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite angles are always equal.
- Therefore, \( \angle 2 = \angle CFD = 42^\circ \).

#### Step 4: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated value of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 42^\circ \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: 39
- B: 42
- C: 48
- D: 51

The correct answer is \( 42 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
