QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the geometric figure step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- **Angle 2** is given as \(60^\circ\).
- **Angle 1** is equal to **Angle 3**.
- We need to find the measure of **Angle 4**.

### Step 2: Identify the relationships between angles
From the figure, we can observe the following:
- Angles 1 and 2 form a linear pair because they are adjacent angles on a straight line. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Angle 1} + \text{Angle 2} = 180^\circ
  \]
  Substituting the value of Angle 2:
  \[
  \text{Angle 1} + 60^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]
  Solving for Angle 1:
  \[
  \text{Angle 1} = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ
  \]

- Since **Angle 1 = Angle 3**, it follows that:
  \[
  \text{Angle 3} = 120^\circ
  \]

### Step 3: Determine the relationship between Angle 3 and Angle 4
Angles 3 and 4 are also a linear pair because they are adjacent angles on a straight line. Therefore:
\[
\text{Angle 3} + \text{Angle 4} = 180^\circ
\]
Substituting the value of Angle 3:
\[
120^\circ + \text{Angle 4} = 180^\circ
\]
Solving for Angle 4:
\[
\text{Angle 4} = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ
\]

### Step 4: Verify the solution
- Angle 1 = 120° (calculated correctly).
- Angle 3 = 120° (since Angle 1 = Angle 3).
- Angle 4 = 60° (since Angle 3 + Angle 4 = 180°).

All relationships and calculations are consistent with the given information.

### Final Answer:
The degree of Angle 4 is \(60^\circ\).
