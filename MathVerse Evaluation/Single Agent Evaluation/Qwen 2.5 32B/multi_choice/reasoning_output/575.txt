### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining how many roots the functions \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) = x^2 + 4x \) have in common. The function \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function that opens upward and passes through the points \((-3, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\). From the graph, we can infer that these are the roots of \( g(x) \).

#### Step 1: Determine the roots of \( g(x) \)
From the graph, the roots of \( g(x) \) are:
\[ g(-3) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad g(4) = 0. \]
Thus, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 4 \).

#### Step 2: Determine the roots of \( f(x) \)
The function \( f(x) = x^2 + 4x \) is also a quadratic function. To find its roots, we solve:
\[ f(x) = x^2 + 4x = 0. \]
Factorizing the equation:
\[ x(x + 4) = 0. \]
This gives the roots:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -4. \]

#### Step 3: Compare the roots of \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \)
- Roots of \( g(x) \): \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 4 \).
- Roots of \( f(x) \): \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -4 \).

By comparing the roots, we see that there are no common roots between \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \).

#### Step 4: Conclusion
Since \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) have no roots in common, the correct answer is:
\[ \text{C: } f \text{ and } g \text{ share no roots in common.} \]
