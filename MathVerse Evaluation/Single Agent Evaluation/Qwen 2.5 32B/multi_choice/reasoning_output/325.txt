QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow the steps systematically:

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The figure is a parallelogram.
- Two adjacent sides of the parallelogram are 13 yd and 10 yd.
- One of the angles between these sides is 45°.
- We need to find the area of the parallelogram.

### Step 2: Recall the formula for the area of a parallelogram
The area \( A \) of a parallelogram can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
However, when the height is not directly given, we can use an alternative formula involving the lengths of two adjacent sides and the sine of the included angle:
\[
A = \text{side}_1 \times \text{side}_2 \times \sin(\theta)
\]
where:
- \(\text{side}_1\) and \(\text{side}_2\) are the lengths of the two adjacent sides.
- \(\theta\) is the angle between these two sides.

### Step 3: Identify the values to plug into the formula
From the problem:
- \(\text{side}_1 = 13 \, \text{yd}\)
- \(\text{side}_2 = 10 \, \text{yd}\)
- \(\theta = 45^\circ\)

### Step 4: Calculate the sine of the angle
The sine of 45° is:
\[
\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Substitute the values into the formula
Using the formula \( A = \text{side}_1 \times \text{side}_2 \times \sin(\theta) \):
\[
A = 13 \times 10 \times \sin(45^\circ)
\]
\[
A = 13 \times 10 \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
A = 130 \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
A = 65 \sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 6: Approximate the value
We know that \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\). Therefore:
\[
A \approx 65 \times 1.414
\]
\[
A \approx 91.91
\]

### Step 7: Round to the nearest tenth
Rounding 91.91 to the nearest tenth gives:
\[
A \approx 91.9
\]

### Step 8: Compare with the answer choices
The calculated area is 91.9, which matches choice B.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
