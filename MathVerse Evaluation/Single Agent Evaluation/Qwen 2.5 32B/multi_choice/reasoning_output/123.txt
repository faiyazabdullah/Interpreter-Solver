### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Understand the problem and given information**
- We have a right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
- The lengths of the sides are:
  - \( AC = 4.0 \) (height of the triangle),
  - \( BC = 3.0 \) (base of the triangle).
- The triangle is rotated around the line \( AC \), which is the vertical side. This rotation generates a cone.
- We need to find the **lateral surface area** of the resulting cone.

#### **Step 2: Identify the components of the cone**
When \( \triangle ABC \) is rotated around \( AC \):
- \( AC \) becomes the **height** (\( h \)) of the cone.
- \( BC \) becomes the **radius** (\( r \)) of the base of the cone.
- The hypotenuse \( AB \) becomes the **slant height** (\( l \)) of the cone.

#### **Step 3: Calculate the slant height (\( l \)) of the cone**
The slant height \( l \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB = \sqrt{AC^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
\]
Thus, the slant height \( l = 5 \).

#### **Step 4: Formula for the lateral surface area of a cone**
The lateral surface area \( A \) of a cone is given by:
\[
A = \pi r l,
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base,
- \( l \) is the slant height.

#### **Step 5: Substitute the known values**
From the problem:
- \( r = BC = 3 \),
- \( l = AB = 5 \).

Substitute these into the formula:
\[
A = \pi \cdot r \cdot l = \pi \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 15\pi.
\]

#### **Step 6: Match the result with the answer choices**
The calculated lateral surface area is \( 15\pi \). Comparing this with the given answer choices:
- A: \( 12\pi \)
- B: \( 15\pi \)
- C: \( 30\pi \)
- D: \( 60\pi \)

The correct answer is \( 15\pi \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
