QUESTION:
As shown in the picture, Xiaoying designed a flashlight to measure the height of an ancient city wall. Place a horizontal plane mirror at point P. The light starts from point A and is reflected by the plane mirror and hits the top C of the ancient city wall CD. It is known that AB perpendicular  BD, CD perpendicular  BD. And it is measured that AB = 1.4, BP = 2.1, PD = 12.0. Then the height of the ancient city wall CD is ()

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **1. Understanding the Geometry and Given Information:**
- The problem involves a geometric setup where a light ray from point \( A \) reflects off a plane mirror at point \( P \) and hits the top of an ancient city wall at point \( C \).
- Key elements:
  - \( AB \perp BD \): Line segment \( AB \) is vertical.
  - \( CD \perp BD \): Line segment \( CD \) is vertical.
  - Measurements:
    - \( AB = 1.4 \) (height of the light source above the ground).
    - \( BP = 2.1 \) (distance from the light source to the mirror along the ground).
    - \( PD = 12.0 \) (distance from the mirror to the base of the city wall along the ground).

#### **2. Applying the Law of Reflection:**
- According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This implies that the path from \( A \) to \( P \) and from \( P \) to \( C \) forms similar triangles due to the symmetry of the reflection.

#### **3. Identifying Similar Triangles:**
- The triangles \( \triangle ABP \) and \( \triangle CDP \) are similar because:
  - \( \angle ABP = \angle CDP = 90^\circ \) (both are right angles).
  - The angles at \( P \) are equal due to the law of reflection.
- Therefore, \( \triangle ABP \sim \triangle CDP \).

#### **4. Setting Up Proportions:**
- Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
  \[
  \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BP}{PD}
  \]
- Substituting the given values:
  \[
  \frac{1.4}{CD} = \frac{2.1}{12}
  \]

#### **5. Solving for \( CD \):**
- Cross-multiply to solve for \( CD \):
  \[
  1.4 \cdot 12 = 2.1 \cdot CD
  \]
  \[
  16.8 = 2.1 \cdot CD
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2.1:
  \[
  CD = \frac{16.8}{2.1} = 8
  \]

#### **6. Verifying the Answer:**
- The height of the ancient city wall \( CD \) is \( 8 \) meters.
- Comparing with the given answer choices:
  - A: 6米
  - B: 8米
  - C: 10米
  - D: 12米

#### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
