### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- The figure shows a circle with center \( O \).
- \( AB \) and \( CD \) are diameters of the circle.
- Chord \( DE \) is parallel to diameter \( AB \).
- Arc \( DE \) subtends an angle of \( 50^\circ \) at the center \( O \).

#### **Step 2: Understand the geometric relationships**
1. **Arc and central angle relationship**: The measure of an arc is equal to the measure of the central angle that subtends it. Therefore, the central angle \( \angle DOE \) (subtended by arc \( DE \)) is \( 50^\circ \).
2. **Parallel chords and diameters**: Since \( DE \parallel AB \), the perpendicular from the center \( O \) to \( DE \) will also be perpendicular to \( AB \). This implies that \( O \) lies on the perpendicular bisector of both \( DE \) and \( AB \).

#### **Step 3: Determine the position of points and angles**
- Since \( AB \) is a diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
- Similarly, \( CD \) is another diameter, so it also divides the circle into two semicircles, each measuring \( 180^\circ \).
- The arc \( DE \) subtends \( 50^\circ \) at the center \( O \), so \( \angle DOE = 50^\circ \).

#### **Step 4: Use symmetry and properties of the circle**
- Because \( DE \parallel AB \), the central angle \( \angle DOE \) is symmetrically placed with respect to the diameters \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- The total angle around point \( O \) is \( 360^\circ \). The arc \( DE \) is part of the circle, and its central angle is \( 50^\circ \).

#### **Step 5: Calculate \( \angle BOC \)**
- Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are diameters, they intersect at the center \( O \), forming four right angles at their intersection.
- The angle \( \angle BOC \) is part of the remaining circle after accounting for the arc \( DE \).
- The arc \( DE \) subtends \( 50^\circ \) at the center, so the remaining arc (which is the rest of the circle excluding arc \( DE \)) is \( 360^\circ - 50^\circ = 310^\circ \).
- However, we need to focus on the specific angle \( \angle BOC \). Since \( AB \) and \( CD \) are diameters, they divide the circle into four quadrants. The angle \( \angle BOC \) is part of one of these quadrants.
- Given the symmetry and the fact that \( DE \parallel AB \), the angle \( \angle BOC \) is directly related to the remaining arc after accounting for the \( 50^\circ \) arc \( DE \).
- Specifically, since \( DE \parallel AB \), the angle \( \angle BOC \) is twice the angle subtended by arc \( DE \) because it spans the opposite side of the circle. Thus, \( \angle BOC = 2 \times 50^\circ = 100^\circ \).

#### **Step 6: Verify the calculation**
- The angle \( \angle BOC \) is indeed \( 100^\circ \) because it is the central angle that spans the arc opposite to arc \( DE \) in the circle.

#### **Final Answer:**
\[ \boxed{B} \]
