### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the radius of the sector used to form a cone when combined with a circular base. Here's the breakdown of the given information:
- The radius of the circular base of the cone is **1.0**.
- The central angle of the sector is **120°**.
- The sector is reshaped into the lateral surface of the cone.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of the Cone
When the sector is reshaped into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. The radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Circumference of the Base of the Cone
The base of the cone is a circle with a radius of **1.0**. Therefore, the circumference \( C \) of the base is:
\[
C = 2\pi \times \text{radius} = 2\pi \times 1 = 2\pi
\]

#### Step 3: Relate the Arc Length of the Sector to the Circumference of the Cone
The arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone. The arc length \( L \) of a sector with a central angle \( \theta \) (in degrees) and radius \( R \) is given by:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi R
\]
Here, the central angle \( \theta = 120^\circ \) and the arc length \( L = 2\pi \). Substituting these values into the formula:
\[
2\pi = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi R
\]

#### Step 4: Solve for the Radius \( R \) of the Sector
Simplify the equation:
\[
2\pi = \frac{1}{3} \times 2\pi R
\]
Divide both sides by \( 2\pi \):
\[
1 = \frac{1}{3} R
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
R = 3
\]

#### Step 5: Verify the Result
The radius of the sector is the slant height of the cone, and our calculation shows that it is **3**. This value satisfies the relationship between the arc length of the sector and the circumference of the base of the cone.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
