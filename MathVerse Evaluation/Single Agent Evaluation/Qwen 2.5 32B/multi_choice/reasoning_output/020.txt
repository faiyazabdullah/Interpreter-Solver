### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the given information**
- \( AB \) is the diameter of circle \( O \).
- \( C \) and \( D \) are points on the circle.
- \( \angle DOB = 140^\circ \).
- We need to find \( \angle ACD \).

#### **Step 2: Use properties of circles**
1. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle Relationship**:
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - Therefore, if \( \angle DOB \) is a central angle, the inscribed angle \( \angle DCB \) that subtends the same arc \( DB \) will be:
     \[
     \angle DCB = \frac{1}{2} \times \angle DOB = \frac{1}{2} \times 140^\circ = 70^\circ.
     \]

2. **Diameter and Right Angles**:
   - Since \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle, \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle (90°) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always 90°.
     \[
     \angle ACB = 90^\circ.
     \]

#### **Step 3: Determine \( \angle ACD \)**
- Notice that \( \angle ACD \) is part of the larger triangle \( \triangle ACD \).
- In \( \triangle ACD \), we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
- However, a more direct approach is to use the fact that \( \angle ACD \) is an inscribed angle that subtends the same arc as \( \angle DCB \).

#### **Step 4: Use the Inscribed Angle Property Again**
- Since \( \angle DCB = 70^\circ \) and \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \), we can find \( \angle ACD \) by noting that \( \angle ACD \) is part of the larger angle \( \angle ACB \).
- Specifically, \( \angle ACD \) is the difference between \( \angle ACB \) and \( \angle DCB \):
  \[
  \angle ACD = \angle ACB - \angle DCB = 90^\circ - 70^\circ = 20^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 5: Verify the Calculation**
- The calculation is consistent with the properties of circles and inscribed angles.
- \( \angle ACD = 20^\circ \) is the correct value based on the given information and geometric properties.

#### **Step 6: Match the Answer with the Choices**
- The calculated value of \( \angle ACD \) is \( 20^\circ \).
- The corresponding answer choice is \( A \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
