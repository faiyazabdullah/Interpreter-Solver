### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- **PA** and **PB** are tangents to circle \(O\) at points **A** and **B**, respectively.
- **EF** is another tangent to circle \(O\) at point **C**, intersecting tangents **PA** and **PB** at points **E** and **F**, respectively.
- The length of **PA** is given as 2.0.
- We need to find the perimeter of triangle **PEF**.

### Key Geometric Properties:
1. **Tangent-Segment Theorem**: From an external point to a circle, the lengths of the two tangents drawn to the circle are equal. Therefore:
   - \( PA = PB \)
   - \( EA = EC \) (tangents from point \(E\))
   - \( FB = FC \) (tangents from point \(F\))

2. Using these properties, we can express the sides of triangle **PEF** in terms of known quantities.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Use the Tangent-Segment Theorem
- Since \( PA \) and \( PB \) are tangents from point \( P \), we have:
  \[
  PA = PB = 2
  \]

- By the Tangent-Segment Theorem:
  - \( EA = EC \)
  - \( FB = FC \)

#### Step 2: Express the Perimeter of Triangle \( PEF \)
The perimeter of triangle \( PEF \) is:
\[
PE + EF + PF
\]

Using the Tangent-Segment Theorem:
- \( PE = PA - EA = PA - EC \)
- \( PF = PB - FB = PB - FC \)
- \( EF = EC + FC \)

Thus, the perimeter of triangle \( PEF \) becomes:
\[
PE + EF + PF = (PA - EC) + (EC + FC) + (PB - FC)
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Expression
Substitute the known values:
\[
PE + EF + PF = (PA - EC) + (EC + FC) + (PB - FC)
\]
\[
= PA - EC + EC + FC + PB - FC
\]
\[
= PA + PB
\]

Since \( PA = PB = 2 \):
\[
PE + EF + PF = 2 + 2 = 4
\]

### Final Answer:
The perimeter of triangle \( PEF \) is 4.

\[
\boxed{C}
\]
