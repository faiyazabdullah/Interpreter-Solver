### Problem Analysis:
We are given a geometric figure where:
- \( P \) is the center of the larger circle.
- \( Q \) is the center of the smaller circle.
- \( P, Q, \) and \( R \) lie on the same straight line.
- The radius of the larger circle is given as 4.
- We need to find the radius of the smaller circle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The radius of the larger circle is 4. This means the distance from \( P \) (center of the larger circle) to any point on its circumference is 4.
- \( P, Q, \) and \( R \) are collinear, meaning they lie on the same straight line.
- \( Q \) is the center of the smaller circle, and we need to find its radius.

#### Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the circles
- Since \( P \) is the center of the larger circle and \( Q \) is the center of the smaller circle, the distance \( PQ \) is the difference between the radii of the two circles.
- Let the radius of the smaller circle be \( r \). Then, the distance \( PQ \) is equal to the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle:
  \[
  PQ = 4 - r
  \]

#### Step 3: Use the geometric configuration
- The points \( P, Q, \) and \( R \) are collinear. Since \( R \) lies on the circumference of both circles, the distance \( PR \) is the sum of the radius of the larger circle and the radius of the smaller circle:
  \[
  PR = 4 + r
  \]
- However, since \( P, Q, \) and \( R \) are collinear, the distance \( PR \) can also be expressed as the sum of \( PQ \) and \( QR \):
  \[
  PR = PQ + QR
  \]
- Here, \( QR \) is the radius of the smaller circle, which is \( r \). Therefore:
  \[
  PR = (4 - r) + r = 4
  \]

#### Step 4: Solve for the radius of the smaller circle
- From the above analysis, we see that the radius of the smaller circle \( r \) must satisfy the condition that the total distance \( PR \) is consistent with the radius of the larger circle.
- Since \( PR = 4 \) and \( PR = 4 + r \), it follows that:
  \[
  4 + r = 4
  \]
- Solving for \( r \):
  \[
  r = 2
  \]

#### Step 5: Verify the solution
- If the radius of the smaller circle is 2, then the distance \( PQ \) is:
  \[
  PQ = 4 - 2 = 2
  \]
- The total distance \( PR \) is:
  \[
  PR = PQ + QR = 2 + 2 = 4
  \]
- This is consistent with the radius of the larger circle, confirming our solution.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
