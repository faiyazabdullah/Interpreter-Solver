QUESTION:
A wedding cake consists of three cylinders stacked on top of each other. The top layer has a radius and height of 20 cm, the middle layer has a radius double this, and the same height and the bottom layer has a radius three times as big, and is twice as high.

All the sides and top surfaces are to be covered in icing, but not the bottom.

What is the surface area of the cake that needs to be iced?

Give your answer to the nearest cm2.

Let $r_1, h_1$ be the radius and height of the top layer, $r_2, h_2$ be the radius and height of the middle layer, and $r_3, h_3$ be the radius and height of the bottom layer.
We are given that $r_1 = 20$ cm and $h_1 = 20$ cm.
The middle layer has a radius double this, so $r_2 = 2r_1 = 2(20) = 40$ cm, and the same height, so $h_2 = h_1 = 20$ cm.
The bottom layer has a radius three times as big as the top layer, so $r_3 = 3r_1 = 3(20) = 60$ cm, and is twice as high, so $h_3 = 2h_1 = 2(20) = 40$ cm.

The surface area of a cylinder (excluding the bottom) is $2\pi r h + \pi r^2$.
For the top layer, the area to be iced is $2\pi r_1 h_1 + \pi r_1^2 = 2\pi (20)(20) + \pi (20)^2 = 800\pi + 400\pi = 1200\pi$.
For the middle layer, the area to be iced is $2\pi r_2 h_2 + \pi (r_2^2 - r_1^2) = 2\pi (40)(20) + \pi (40^2 - 20^2) = 1600\pi + \pi (1600 - 400) = 1600\pi + 1200\pi = 2800\pi$.
For the bottom layer, the area to be iced is $2\pi r_3 h_3 + \pi (r_3^2 - r_2^2) = 2\pi (60)(40) + \pi (60^2 - 40^2) = 4800\pi + \pi (3600 - 1600) = 4800\pi + 2000\pi = 6800\pi$.

The total surface area to be iced is $1200\pi + 2800\pi + 6800\pi = (1200+2800+6800)\pi = 10800\pi$.
Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we have $10800\pi \approx 10800 \times 3.14159 = 33929.2$.
Rounding to the nearest cm$^2$, the surface area is $33929$ cm$^2$.
