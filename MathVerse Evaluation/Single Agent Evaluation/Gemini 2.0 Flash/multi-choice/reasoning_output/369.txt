GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
In the right-angled triangle ABC, we are given that angle A = 30°, angle C = 60°, and AB = sqrt(3). We are asked to find the length of BC, which is denoted as h.

We can use trigonometric ratios to find the length of BC. Since we know the length of AB and the angle A, we can use the tangent function.

tan(A) = opposite / adjacent
tan(30°) = BC / AB
tan(30°) = h / sqrt(3)

We know that tan(30°) = 1/sqrt(3). So,
1/sqrt(3) = h / sqrt(3)
Multiplying both sides by sqrt(3), we get:
h = (1/sqrt(3)) * sqrt(3)
h = 1

Thus, the length of BC is 1.
