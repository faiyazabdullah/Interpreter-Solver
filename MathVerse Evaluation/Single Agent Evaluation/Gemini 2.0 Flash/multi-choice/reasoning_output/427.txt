QUESTION:
A boat travels S 14^\circ E for 12 km and then changes direction to S 49^\circ E for another 16 km.

Hence write down the bearing that the boat should travel on to return to the starting point.

Let's denote the starting point as S, the point after the first leg as A, and the final point (current position) as B. We are given that SA = 12 km and AB = 16 km. The bearing from S to A is S 14° E, and the bearing from A to B is S 49° E. We want to find the bearing from B to S.

First, let's find the angle at A. The angle between the north direction at A and the line segment AB is 49°. The angle between the south direction at A and the line segment SA is 14°. The angle SAB can be found using the law of cosines. To apply the law of cosines, we need to find the angle SAB.

The angle between the south direction at A and the line segment SA is 14°. The angle between the south direction at A and the line segment AB is 49°. Therefore, the angle SAB = 180° - (49° - 14°) = 180° - 35° = 145°.

Now, we can use the law of cosines to find the distance SB (denoted by x in the diagram).
x^2 = 12^2 + 16^2 - 2 * 12 * 16 * cos(145°)
x^2 = 144 + 256 - 384 * (-0.819)
x^2 = 400 + 314.5
x^2 = 714.5
x = sqrt(714.5) ≈ 26.73 km

Now we use the Law of Sines to find the angle at B (angle ABS), say angle theta.
sin(145°) / 26.73 = sin(theta) / 12
sin(theta) = (12 * sin(145°)) / 26.73
sin(theta) = (12 * 0.5736) / 26.73
sin(theta) = 6.8832 / 26.73
sin(theta) = 0.2575
theta = arcsin(0.2575) ≈ 14.9°

Now, the angle the direction of the boat makes with the south line at B is 49. Let the angle that the path from B to S makes with the south line at B be denoted by 'a'.
Then a + 49 = angle EBS, where EBS is the angle between the north line at S and the south line at B, i.e. 180 + (180 - 14). Let's instead determine the angle between BS and the north direction. Call this angle 'a'
Angle between AB and North = 180-49 = 131
angle SAB = 145 degrees
Angle at B = 14.9
Let angle between BS and North be 'x'. 
sum of angles in triangle is 180 = 145 + 14.9 + angle at B
We know that angle between vertical lines at north is 180 -14 = 166. 

Law of sines gives us the angle SAB. Then, we can figure out that the bearing the boat should travel is N 14.9 W. Then add 49 - (90) to get the number. Subtract the angle 145 + 14.9 = 159.9. 
Since x is the angle between BS and South.
Then sin(145)/ 26.73 = sin(x) /12

sin(x) = 12*sin(145)/26.73 = 12*.5736 /26.73 = 0.2575

Therefore x= arcsin (0.2575) = 14.9 degrees

Then it is 49 + 14.9 = the bearing. 
The bearing from B to S = N (49 + 14.9)= 63.9. This is just 64 degrees. That is the angle
Then a should be around 63.9 degrees,
So we go north. So it is the west.
