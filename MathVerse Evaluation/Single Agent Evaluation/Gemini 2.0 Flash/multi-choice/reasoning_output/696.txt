The figure consists of two cylinders, one on top of the other. The top cylinder has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 2 cm. The bottom cylinder has a radius of 9 cm and a height of 2 cm.
The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.

Volume of the top cylinder is:
$V_1 = \pi (4^2) (2) = \pi (16)(2) = 32\pi$

Volume of the bottom cylinder is:
$V_2 = \pi (9^2) (2) = \pi (81)(2) = 162\pi$

The total volume of the figure is the sum of the volumes of the two cylinders:
$V = V_1 + V_2 = 32\pi + 162\pi = 194\pi$

We can approximate $\pi$ as 3.14159265359. Therefore,
$V = 194 \times 3.14159265359 = 609.451042$

The volume of the figure is approximately 609.45 cubic centimeters.
