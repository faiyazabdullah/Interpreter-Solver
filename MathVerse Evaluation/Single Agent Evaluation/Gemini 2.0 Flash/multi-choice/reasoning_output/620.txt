QUESTION:
This graph shows the relationship between the current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms) in an electrical circuit, when the voltage provided to the circuit is 240 V. The equation could be described as \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}}=\text{Current}

What happens to the current as the resistance increases?

CHOICES:
A:The current increases.
B:The current decreases.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows that as the resistance increases (moving right on the graph), the current decreases (moves down on the graph).

Final Answer: B
