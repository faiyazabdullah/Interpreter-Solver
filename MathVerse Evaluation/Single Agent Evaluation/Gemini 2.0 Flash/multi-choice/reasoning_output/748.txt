QUESTION:
The following is a right pyramid on a square base with side length 16cm. A right pyramid has its apex aligned directly above the centre of its base.

The edge length VA is 26cm.
Find the length of VW, the perpendicular height of the pyramid correct to two decimal places.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

The base ABCD is a square with side length 16cm. Therefore, the length of diagonal AC is $16\sqrt{2}$ cm. Since W is the center of the base, AW = $\frac{1}{2}AC = \frac{1}{2} \times 16\sqrt{2} = 8\sqrt{2}$ cm.

V is the apex of the pyramid, and VW is the perpendicular height of the pyramid. The edge length VA is 26 cm.
Consider the right triangle VWA, where VA is the hypotenuse, AW is one leg, and VW is the other leg. By the Pythagorean theorem, $VA^2 = VW^2 + AW^2$, so $VW^2 = VA^2 - AW^2$.
$VW^2 = 26^2 - (8\sqrt{2})^2 = 26^2 - 64 \times 2 = 676 - 128 = 548$.
$VW = \sqrt{548} \approx 23.409400676$.
The length of VW, the perpendicular height of the pyramid correct to two decimal places, is 23.41 cm.
There are no answer choices, so this question will not have A, B, C, or D. Since there is no choice, I cannot give the answer, however the height would be 23.41.

Final Answer: A
