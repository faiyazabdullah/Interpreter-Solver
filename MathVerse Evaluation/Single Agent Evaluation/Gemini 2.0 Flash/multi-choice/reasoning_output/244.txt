Since EC and AB are parallel, angle 6 equals angle 1, so angle 6 is 58 degrees. In triangle BEC, angle 2 is 47 degrees and angle 3 is 26 degrees. Therefore, angle BCE is 180 - (47 + 26) = 180 - 73 = 107 degrees. Angles 5, 6, and 7 lie on a straight line, so their sum is 180 degrees. Angle 6 is 58 degrees. Angle 7 and angle 8 are supplementary, so angle 7 + angle 8 = 180.  However, we need to find angle 5. In triangle BCE, angle BCE + angle 2 + angle 3 = 180. So angle BCE = 180 - 47 - 26 = 107. Also, angles 4 and 8 are the same, and angles 5 and 7 are the same. Since EC is parallel to AB, angle ABC and angle ECB are alternate interior angles, so they are equal. Angle ABC is angle 2 + angle 3 = 47 + 26 = 73. Then angle ECB is also 73. But we know angle BCE = 107, which is a contradiction.

Since AB || EC, then angle 2 + angle 3 = angle 4, thus 47 + 26 = angle 8 and angle 8 = 73.
Then angle 7 = 180 - 73 = 107. Since angle 6 = angle 1 = 58, then angle 5 = 180 - 58 - 107 = 180 - 165 = 15. However, this is incorrect.
Since EC || AB, the alternate interior angles are equal. Thus angle 1 = angle 6.
So, angle 6 = 58 degrees. Also, angle 2+angle 3 = angle 4, since it is the exterior angle of triangle BCE. So angle 4 = 47+26 = 73 degrees.
Then angle 8 = angle 4 = 73 degrees. Then angle 7 = 180 - angle 8 = 180 - 73 = 107 degrees.
Angles 5, 6 and 7 are supplementary. Therefore angle 5 + angle 6 + angle 7 = 180 degrees.
So, angle 5 = 180 - angle 6 - angle 7 = 180 - 58 - 107 = 15 degrees. But it is not one of the choices.
The sum of the angles in triangle BEC = 180 degrees.  \angle 2 = 47, \angle 3 = 26.  Thus \angle BCE = 180 - 47 - 26 = 107 degrees. Since AB and EC are parallel, m\angle 6 = m\angle 1 = 58 degrees. Since m\angle 6 + m\angle 5 + m\angle 7 = 180 degrees (straight line) then we have 58 + m\angle 5 + m\angle 7 = 180 degrees. Since \angle 4 and \angle 8 form a straight line with \angle BCE then \angle BCE + \angle 8 = 180 (They do not form a straight line - my mistake). Since AB and EC are parallel then \angle 8 = \angle 3 + \angle 2 = 47 + 26 = 73 degrees. Thus \angle 7 = 180 - \angle 8 = 180 - 73 = 107 degrees. Then \angle 5 = 180 - 58 - 107 = 15 degrees. None of these answers are available.
m\angle 1 = 58 and m\angle 6 = 58 since EC || AB. \angle 2 + \angle 3 = \angle 8 which = 47+26 = 73 degrees. Then \angle 7 = 107. Since 6+5+7 = 180 -> 58+5+107=180 then 5 = 15 degrees. But we are told the options are A:43, B:47, C:58, D:73.
