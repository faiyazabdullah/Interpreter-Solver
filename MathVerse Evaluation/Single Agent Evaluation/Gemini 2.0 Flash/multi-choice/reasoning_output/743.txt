The problem presents a square pyramid that is split into two sections, the upper section is a square pyramid and the lower section is a frustum.
The following dimensions are given: length of middle base = 8, height of upper pyramid = 2x+3, height of entire pyramid = 6x+9.

The ratio of the heights is equal to the ratio of the side lengths. Let L be the side length of the base of the pyramid. The ratio of the side length of the base of upper pyramid to the side length of the base of the entire pyramid is 8/L.

The ratio of the height of the upper pyramid to the height of the entire pyramid is (2x+3)/(6x+9). Since (6x+9) = 3(2x+3), the ratio simplifies to 1/3.

Thus, 8/L = 1/3.
Therefore, L = 3*8 = 24.
Since the question asks for an expression for the length L in terms of x, and L = 24, it implies L is not dependent on x. There must have been a misunderstanding. Let's re-examine the relationships.

Ratio of heights: $\frac{2x+3}{6x+9} = \frac{2x+3}{3(2x+3)} = \frac{1}{3}$
Ratio of sides: $\frac{8}{L}$

Since these are similar pyramids, we have
$\frac{8}{L} = \frac{1}{3}$
$L = 24$

The length of the base of the pyramid is 24 and is independent of the value of x.
