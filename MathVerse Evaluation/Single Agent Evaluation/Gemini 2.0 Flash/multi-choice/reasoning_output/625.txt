QUESTION:
A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The rectangular box has vertices (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0).
The length of the box is 40 cm and the width is 20 cm.
The center of the rectangle is the midpoint of the diagonal connecting (0,0) and (40,20), or the diagonal connecting (0,20) and (40,0).
The midpoint formula is $\left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)$.
Using (0,0) and (40,20), the center is $\left(\frac{0+40}{2}, \frac{0+20}{2}\right) = (20, 10)$.
Using (0,20) and (40,0), the center is $\left(\frac{0+40}{2}, \frac{20+0}{2}\right) = (20, 10)$.
The largest possible ellipse will have its center at the center of the rectangle.
The center of the cake is at (20, 10).
