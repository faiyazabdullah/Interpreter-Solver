QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening upward and goes through (-3,0) and (4,0). f(x)=x^2+4x. How many roots do the functions have in common?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ and $g$ share the same root(s).
B:$f$ and $g$ share one root in common but each have another root that is not shared.
C:$f$ and $g$ share no roots in common.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The function $g(x)$ is a quadratic function that opens upward and goes through the points $(-3, 0)$ and $(4, 0)$. Thus, the roots of $g(x)$ are $-3$ and $4$.

Given $f(x) = x^2 + 4x$. We want to find the roots of $f(x)$, so we set $f(x) = 0$ and solve for $x$.
$x^2 + 4x = 0$
$x(x + 4) = 0$
Thus, the roots are $x = 0$ and $x = -4$.

The roots of $g(x)$ are $-3$ and $4$.
The roots of $f(x)$ are $0$ and $-4$.

Comparing the roots of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$, we see that they have no roots in common.
