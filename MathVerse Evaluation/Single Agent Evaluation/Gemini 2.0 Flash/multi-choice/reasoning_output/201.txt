Let the distance from M to AC be d, and the distance from M to TN be d. Since the distances from the center to the chords are equal, we have AC = TN.
Also, MA = MC since both are radii of the circle. Thus triangle MAC is an isosceles triangle with MA = MC.

Since AC = TN, the arcs AC and TN are equal in measure.
The inscribed angle \angle CTN is 28 degrees.
Therefore, the arc CN has a measure of 2 * 28 = 56 degrees.

Since arcs AC = TN, we have arc AC = arc AN + arc TN.
Let arc AN be x.
Arc AC = arc AN + arc CN, so Arc AC = x + 56
Arc TN = Arc AC, so arc TN = x + 56
However, arc TN = arc TA + arc AN = arc TA + x
So arc TA + x = x + 56
Arc TA = 56

\angle TMA = arc TA = 56 degrees (central angle)
In quadrilateral ATMN, we know that angles AMT, ANM, and ATM are 90 degrees.
Thus AM bisects angle A, and angle CMA = angle TMA
Also angles CTA = angle CNA
We have arc AC = arc TN.
arc AC = arc AN + arc NC
Let angle CAM be x. Then angle ACM is also x, so arc AM = arc CM.
Then angle AMC = 180 - 2x.
Since the distance from M to chord AC is the same as the distance from M to chord TN, AC=TN. Therefore, angle ANC = angle CTA = 28. Since MC=MA, triangle MAC is isosceles. Then angle CAM=angle ACM. Let angle CAM=x. Since AC = TN, arc AC = arc TN. Arc TN = 2(28) = 56. Arc AC = arc AM + arc CM = 2x
Arc TN = 56 degrees
Then arc AC = 56 degrees.
Angle CMA = 180-2x. Since arc AC = 56, the central angle AMC = 56.
So 180-2x = 56
2x = 180 - 56
2x = 124
x = 62 degrees

However, the perpendicular distance from M to AC bisects AC, and AM=MC, so triangle AMC is isosceles.
Arc AC is congruent to arc TN, so AC = TN.
Since the distance from the center to AC is equal to the distance from the center to TN, the length of the chord AC must be equal to the length of chord TN.
So triangle AMC is isosceles with MA = MC. Then angle MAC = angle MCA.
Since the length of the chords are equal, arc AC = arc TN. Angle CTN is 28 degrees, so arc CN is twice that, or 56 degrees.
If we drop a perpendicular from M to AC, we call the foot P. Then angle AMP is a right angle.
Also, angle CAM = angle CAM. So we have two right triangles, ATNM and ACMM.
Since arc TN = arc AC = 2 angle AMC. So angle AMC = 1/2 AC.
Angle CTN = 28, so angle CTN intercepts arc CN, so arc CN = 2*28 = 56 degrees.

Since chord AC = chord TN, arc AC = arc TN. Angle MAC = angle MCA.
