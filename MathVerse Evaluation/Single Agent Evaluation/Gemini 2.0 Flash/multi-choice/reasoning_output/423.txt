QUESTION:
After two meteoroids collide at point A, one starts travelling in the direction of point B, while the other starts travelling in the direction of point C, with an angle of 53^\circ  between the two directions. The meteoroid projected in the direction of B is moving at a speed of 7860 km/h, while the other is moving at a speed of 10170 km/h.


What distance will the meteoroid travelling towards point B have covered after 29 minutes?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The meteoroid projected in the direction of B is moving at a speed of 7860 km/h.
We need to find the distance it will cover after 29 minutes.
First, we need to convert the time from minutes to hours.
29 minutes = 29/60 hours
Now, we can use the formula: Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 7860 km/h × (29/60) hours
Distance = 7860 × (29/60) km
Distance = (7860 × 29) / 60 km
Distance = 228,000 / 60 km = 3807 km

The distance covered by the meteoroid travelling towards point B after 29 minutes is 3807 km.
