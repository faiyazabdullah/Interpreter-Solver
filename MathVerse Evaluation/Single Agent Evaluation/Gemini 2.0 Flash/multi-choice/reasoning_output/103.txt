According to the inscribed angle theorem, an inscribed angle is half of its intercepted central angle.
The inscribed angle is $\angle ABC = 130^\circ$. The central angle subtended by the major arc AC is $\angle AOC$.
Let the central angle subtended by minor arc AC be x.
The inscribed angle that intercepts minor arc AC is $360^\circ - 130^\circ \times 2 = x$.
We have $x = 2 \times (180^\circ - 130^\circ) = 2 \times 50^\circ = 100^\circ$.
The central angle subtended by the minor arc AC is $2(180^\circ - 130^\circ) = 2(50^\circ) = 100^\circ$.
Therefore, the angle $AOC$ subtended by the major arc AC is $360^\circ - 100^\circ = 260^\circ$. This is impossible.

The reflex angle at O is twice angle B. Angle B is 130. Thus, the reflex angle at O is 260.
The acute angle AOC is $360 - 260 = 100$.
