B:No

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph passes through (-1,0), (0,8), (2,0), (4,0).
To determine if the graph has an inverse function, we can use the horizontal line test.
A function has an inverse function if and only if no horizontal line intersects the graph of the function more than once.
In this case, a horizontal line at y=0 intersects the graph at x=-1, x=2, and x=4. Since the horizontal line y=0 intersects the graph at more than one point, the function does not have an inverse function.
Another way to look at it is, for a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one (each x value corresponds to a unique y value, and each y value corresponds to a unique x value).
Here, we have multiple x values mapping to the same y value (y=0). For example, x=-1, x=2, and x=4 all correspond to y=0.
Therefore, the function does not have an inverse.
