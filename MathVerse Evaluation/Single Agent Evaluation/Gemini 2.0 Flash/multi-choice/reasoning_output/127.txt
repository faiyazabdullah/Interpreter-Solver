QUESTION:
Lulu cuts a circle and a sector piece of paper from the paper (as shown in the picture), and uses them to form a cone model. If the radius of the circle is 1.0. The central angle of the sector is equal to 120.0, then the radius of the sector is ()

CHOICES:
A:√{3}
B:√{6}
C:3
D:6

The circumference of the base circle of the cone is equal to the arc length of the sector.
The radius of the circle is 1, so its circumference is 2π(1) = 2π.
Let the radius of the sector be R. The arc length of the sector is given by (central angle/360) * 2πR.
Since the central angle of the sector is 120 degrees, the arc length is (120/360) * 2πR = (1/3) * 2πR.
The arc length of the sector equals the circumference of the circle, so (1/3) * 2πR = 2π.
Dividing both sides by 2π, we get (1/3)R = 1.
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get R = 3.
So, the radius of the sector is 3.
