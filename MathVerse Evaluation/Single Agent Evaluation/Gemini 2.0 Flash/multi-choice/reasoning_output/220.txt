We are given that $CE$ and $AB$ are diameters of circle $G$. We are also given that $\angle AGD$ is a right angle (90 degrees) and $\angle AGC$ is 60 degrees. We want to find the measure of $\angle BGE$.

Since $AB$ is a diameter, $\angle AGB = 180^{\circ}$. We also know that $\angle AGD = 90^{\circ}$. Thus, $\angle DGB = 180^{\circ} - 90^{\circ} = 90^{\circ}$.
Since $CE$ is a diameter, $\angle CGE = 180^{\circ}$.
We know that $\angle AGC = 60^{\circ}$, so $\angle AGE = 180^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} = 120^{\circ}$.
Since $\angle AGB = 180^{\circ}$, we also have $\angle AGC + \angle CGB = 180^{\circ}$. Since $\angle AGC = 60^{\circ}$, we have $\angle CGB = 180^{\circ} - 60^{\circ} = 120^{\circ}$.
Now, consider $\angle BGE$. Since $\angle AGE = 120^{\circ}$ and $\angle AGB = 180^{\circ}$, we have
$\angle BGE = \angle AGB - \angle AGE = 180^{\circ} - (180^{\circ} - \angle AGC) = 180^{\circ} - 120^{\circ} = 60^{\circ}$.
Alternatively, since vertical angles are equal, we have $\angle BGE = \angle AGC = 60^{\circ}$.
