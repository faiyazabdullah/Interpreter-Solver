GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The vertex of the absolute value function f(x) = |x| is at (0, 0). The given piecewise function has a vertex at (-2, 1). This means the function has been shifted 2 units to the left and 1 unit up. Therefore, the equation of the transformed function is f(x) = |x + 2| + 1. The graph looks like the standard absolute value function and stretches at the same rate. Since the problem describes the graph as "piecewise," then we also know it will behave as a absolute value with the function split into the respective piecewise regions, so the transformations are f(x) = |x+2|+1.
