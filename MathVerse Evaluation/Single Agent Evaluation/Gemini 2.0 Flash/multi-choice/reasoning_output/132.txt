QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to measure the height AB of a pavilion (the distance from the top A to the horizontal ground BD), Xiaoming placed a step DE (DE = BC = 0.6) that is the same height as the pavilion step BC beside the pavilion, find A, B, C Three points are collinear), place a mirror horizontally at point G on the platform, and measure CG = 12.0, and then move back along the straight line CG to point E. At this time, you can see the top A of the pavilion in the mirror, and measure GE = 2.0, Xiaoming's height EF = 1.6, then the height of the pavilion AB is approximately ()

CHOICES:
A:9米
B:9.6米
C:10米
D:10.2米

According to the principle of reflection, ∠AGC = ∠EGF. Since both AC and EF are perpendicular to the ground CD, therefore ∠ACG = ∠FEG = 90°, then △ACG ~ △EFG.
Thus AC/EF = CG/EG.
Then AC/1.6 = 12/2, AC = 9.6.
Thus AB = AC + BC = 9.6 + 0.6 = 10.2 meters.
