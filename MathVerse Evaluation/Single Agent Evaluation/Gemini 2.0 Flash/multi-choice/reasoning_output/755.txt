We are given six right triangles arranged in an irregular figure. We are given the lengths of some sides of the triangles. We need to find the value of x^2 + y^2.

The triangles have side lengths:
1) sqrt(7), 2, sqrt(10) since (sqrt(7))^2 + 2^2 = 7 + 4 = 11 != (sqrt(10))^2 = 10. It should be sqrt(7), sqrt(3), sqrt(10). Because 7 + 3 = 10
2) 2, sqrt(6), sqrt(10) since 2^2 + (sqrt(6))^2 = 4 + 6 = 10 = (sqrt(10))^2
3) sqrt(6), x, ?
4) x, y, ?
5) y, sqrt(3), ?
6) sqrt(3), sqrt(3), sqrt(6) because (sqrt(3))^2 + (sqrt(3))^2 = 3 + 3 = 6 = (sqrt(6))^2

Since the triangles are right triangles, we can use the Pythagorean theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2).
Triangle 1: (sqrt(7))^2 + 2^2 = sqrt(10)^2.  This is incorrect as (sqrt(7))^2 + (sqrt(3))^2 = (sqrt(10))^2
7 + 3 = 10. So we have lengths sqrt(7), sqrt(3), sqrt(10).
Triangle 2: 2^2 + (sqrt(6))^2 = (sqrt(10))^2. This holds because 4 + 6 = 10. So we have lengths 2, sqrt(6), sqrt(10).
Triangle 6: (sqrt(3))^2 + (sqrt(3))^2 = (sqrt(6))^2.  This holds because 3 + 3 = 6. So we have lengths sqrt(3), sqrt(3), sqrt(6).

Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle 3:
(sqrt(6))^2 + x^2 = z^2, where z is the hypotenuse
Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle 4:
x^2 + y^2 = w^2, where w is the hypotenuse
Using the Pythagorean theorem for triangle 5:
y^2 + (sqrt(3))^2 = v^2, where v is the hypotenuse

Observe that:
(sqrt(10))^2 = (sqrt(7))^2 + (sqrt(3))^2 = 10
(sqrt(10))^2 = 2^2 + (sqrt(6))^2 = 10
(sqrt(6))^2 = (sqrt(3))^2 + (sqrt(3))^2 = 6

We can find x and y:
Let the lengths of the sides be sqrt(3), 2, sqrt(6), sqrt(7), x, y.
We see two sqrt(3) sides: Triangle 1 and Triangle 6
We see sqrt(6): Triangle 2 and Triangle 6
We see sqrt(7): Triangle 1
We see number 2: Triangle 2
Triangle 3 has sqrt(6) as one side.
We have (sqrt(6))^2 + x^2 = z^2 where z is the length of the hypotenuse
We need to find x and y.
Since we are looking for x^2 + y^2, it suggests the hypotenuse of triangle 4.

If we assume the side opposite sqrt(6) is sqrt(7), then the next side is number 2. Therefore x = sqrt(3) and y = 2.
If x = sqrt(3), then we need to determine the side length y.
If y = 2, then x^2 + y^2 = (sqrt(3))^2 + 2^2 = 3 + 4 = 7
However, the triangle with hypotenuse y is similar to the first triangle. Therefore the lengths of this is sqrt(3).
Thus y = 2.
Hence x^2 + y^2 = (sqrt(3))^2 + 2^2 = 3 + 4 = 7. This doesn't correspond to any of the answer choices

Look at the figure. We have sides sqrt(3), 2, sqrt(6), sqrt(7).
x and y are two sides of a right triangle. We want to determine x^2 + y^2
We see that the 2 right triangles with x and y.
Look at triangle 3. Has sqrt(6) and x.
Look at triangle 5. Has y and sqrt(3)
Assume triangles 3 and 5 are similar. Assume x = sqrt(7) and y = 2. Then x^2 + y^2 = 7 + 4 = 11.
Assume x = sqrt(3) and y = sqrt(7). Then x^2 + y^2 = 3 + 7 = 10. This also doesn't correspond.
Since x is hypotenuse of the triangle with sqrt(3). x^2 = 3 + 3 = 6. So x = sqrt(6). Also, let x and y be sides. x = sqrt(7) and y = sqrt(3).
Thus y^2 = (sqrt(3))^2 and x^2 = (sqrt(7))^2, then x^2 + y^2 = 3 + 7 = 10
Assume y = 2, x = sqrt(3).

x^2 + y^2 = 3+4 = 7

Let's try another approach. x is adjacent to sqrt(6). y is adjacent to sqrt(3).
x^2 + y^2 = c^2, we need to solve for x^2+y^2.
Let triangle lengths: sqrt(7), sqrt(3), sqrt(10).
2, sqrt(6), sqrt(10).
sqrt(3), sqrt(3), sqrt(6).

Assume x = sqrt(7) and y = sqrt(6), thus x^2 + y^2 = 7 + 6 = 13. None of the answers correspond.

Triangle next to y is similar to triangle with 2 and sqrt(6).
x^2 + y^2: Triangle lengths sqrt(7),sqrt(3),sqrt(10). 2, sqrt(6),sqrt(10). sqrt(3),sqrt(3),sqrt(6)
Assume side x = sqrt(3)
Assume side y = sqrt(6)
x^2 + y^2 = 3+6 = 9, none of these are the hypotenuse, thus not true.
If sqrt(7) * sqrt(6) = sqrt(42)

If we assume x=sqrt(3) and y=2 then sqrt(3)^2+ 2^2 = 3+4 =7 not correct
if x=sqrt(6) and y= sqrt(3) then sqrt(6)^2 + sqrt(3)^2 = 6+3 =9. None of these
Try x = sqrt(7) y=sqrt(3). 7+3 =10 Not an answer.
x = sqrt(10), y=sqrt(7), 10+7=17 not an answer

We are looking for the sum of squares of sides x, y, such that its hypotenuse is x^2+y^2.
If we look at the small triangle sides are sqrt(3), sqrt(3), sqrt(6). Area 3/2.
Other triangles: sides = 2.
Sides are 3, x. y.
Sides x =sqrt(7), side y = sqrt(6) , sqrt{7^2+6^2} = sqrt(13) 7 + 6=13.

We want to find side length with side values of sqrt(10).
sqrt{10 +sqrt{}7}.
Consider side lengths with x = y
2x^2+2y^2
Consider x=sqrt(3). then side y = 2.
Then x2+y2= (sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)+2^2)= 7
We are looking for values. 7 has 33 as the smallest diff

3+6+7+10=
A.21
B.27
C.33
D.\sqrt{593} (approximately 24.35)
E.\sqrt{611} (approximately 24.72)
sqrt(593). x2=
