QUESTION:
There is an ellipse, for which the domain is from -3 to -1 and the range is from -1 to 3. Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A:This is a one-to-one function
B:This is not a one-to-one function

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The question asks if the ellipse is a one-to-one function. A one-to-one function requires that for every y-value, there is only one x-value. This can be determined by using the horizontal line test. If any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, then the relation is not a one-to-one function. Visually, we can see that any horizontal line between y=-1 and y=3 will intersect the ellipse at two points.
Therefore, the ellipse is not a one-to-one function.

Final Answer: B
