QUESTION:
In triangle ABC above, AB = AC,point E lies on line AB, point D lies on lien AC, E is the midpoint of line AB, and D is the midpoint of line AC. If AE = x and ED = 4, what is length BC?

CHOICES:
A.6
B.8
C.2*x
D.4*x
E.4*x^2

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Given that AB = AC, E is the midpoint of AB, and D is the midpoint of AC, we have AE = EB and AD = DC.
Also, AE = x and ED = 4.
Since E and D are midpoints of AB and AC respectively, we know that ED is parallel to BC, and ED = (1/2)BC.
Therefore, BC = 2 * ED.
Since ED = 4, BC = 2 * 4 = 8.

Final Answer: B
