QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the radius.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The circle intersects the y-axis at approximately (0, 2) and (0, -2). It intersects the x-axis at approximately (-2, 0) and (2, 0). The center of the circle appears to be at the origin (0, 0). The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. We can see that the distance from the center (0, 0) to the point (2, 0) is 2 units. Similarly, the distance from the center (0, 0) to the point (0, 2) is also 2 units. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 2.
