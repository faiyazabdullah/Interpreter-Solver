The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is -6.
We can find the equation of the line using the two-intercept form:
x/a + y/b = 1, where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept.
In our case, a = -3 and b = -6.
So the equation of the line is x/(-3) + y/(-6) = 1
Multiplying both sides by -6, we get:
2x + y = -6
or 2x + y + 6 = 0
Since the region above the line is shaded, the inequality will be:
2x + y + 6 >= 0
or 2x + y >= -6
The line is solid, so we use '>=' and '<='. The shaded region is above the line.
Let's test the point (0,0).
2(0) + 0 = 0 >= -6.
Since (0,0) is in the shaded region, the inequality is 2x + y >= -6
