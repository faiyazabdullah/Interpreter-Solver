QUESTION:
There is a function representing a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1 unit. There is a point A on the circle with an angle of $\frac{\pi}{5}$ to the negative x-axis. What is the value of the x-coordinate of point A?

CHOICES:
A:$\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)$
B:$\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)$
C:$\sin \left(\frac{6 \pi}{5}\right)$
D:$\cos \left(\frac{6 \pi}{5}\right)$
E:$\sin \left(\frac{9 \pi}{5}\right)$
F:$\cos \left(\frac{9 \pi}{5}\right)$

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The circle has a radius of 1 unit and is centered at the origin. Point A is located on the circle such that the angle between the negative x-axis and the line connecting the origin to point A is $\frac{\pi}{5}$.

The angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to point A can be calculated as $\pi + \frac{\pi}{5} = \frac{5\pi}{5} + \frac{\pi}{5} = \frac{6\pi}{5}$.
Let the coordinates of point A be $(x, y)$. Since the circle has radius 1, we have $x = \cos(\frac{6\pi}{5})$ and $y = \sin(\frac{6\pi}{5})$.
Therefore, the x-coordinate of point A is $\cos(\frac{6\pi}{5})$.
