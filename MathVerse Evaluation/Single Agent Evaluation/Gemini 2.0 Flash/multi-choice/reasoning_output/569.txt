QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph of $f(x) = x^2$ is shifted to obtain the graph of $g(x)$. We can see that the vertex of $f(x)$ is at $(0,0)$. The vertex of $g(x)$ appears to be at $(0,-2)$. This means that the graph of $f(x)$ has been shifted down by 2 units. Therefore, the equation for $g(x)$ is $g(x) = x^2 - 2$.
