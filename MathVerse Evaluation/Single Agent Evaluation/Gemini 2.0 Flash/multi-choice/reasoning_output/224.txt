QUESTION:
In the figure, a regular polygon is inscribed in a circle with center R. R S is perpendicular to K L. Find the measure of a central angle.

CHOICES:
A:30
B:60
C:90
D:120

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The polygon inscribed in the circle is a regular hexagon, which has 6 sides. The central angle is the angle formed by connecting the center of the circle to two adjacent vertices of the hexagon. Since a full circle is 360 degrees, the central angle of a regular hexagon is 360/6 = 60 degrees. Therefore, the measure of the central angle is 60.
