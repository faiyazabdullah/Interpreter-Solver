QUESTION:
Place a ruler and a triangular plate as shown in the figure, angle 1 = 40.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()

CHOICES:
A:130째
B:140째
C:120째
D:125째

Angle 1 = 40 degrees. The angle adjacent to angle 1 is 90 degrees.
The sum of angles on a straight line is 180 degrees.
Therefore, the angle between the ruler and the side of the triangle = 180 - 90 - 40 = 50 degrees.
The triangle plate has angles 90, 60, 30 degrees.
Angle 2 is an exterior angle of a triangle formed by the intersection of the ruler, the triangle and the edge of the paper.
Let angle 3 be the angle in the triangle which is opposite to angle 2.
Angle 3 = 60 degrees. The angle between the ruler and the side of the triangle = 50 degrees.
Therefore, angle 2 = angle 3 + 50 = 60 + 50 = 110 degrees.
Another possibility is that angle 3 = 30. Therefore, angle 2 = 30 + 50 = 80.
The angles in the triangle are 90, 45 and 45.
Angle 3 = 45.
Therefore, angle 2 = 45 + 50 = 95 degrees.
The angle between the ruler and the side of the triangle equals to 50.
The angles of the triangle are 30, 60 and 90.
Angle 2 is an exterior angle.
Angle 2 = 50 + 90 = 140 degrees.
