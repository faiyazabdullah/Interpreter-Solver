QUESTION:
In \odot F, B, C, D, A are on the circle and A C is a diameter. \angle C F D is 4 a - 1 degrees. Find the measure of \angle A F B.

CHOICES:
A:72
B:108
C:120
D:144

Since AC is a diameter, the measure of angle AFC is 180 degrees. We are given that angle CFD is (4a - 1) degrees and angle AFD is (2a - 5) degrees. Therefore, the sum of the angles CFD and AFD is equal to the angle AFC. Thus, (4a - 1) + (2a - 5) = 180. Combining like terms, we have 6a - 6 = 180. Adding 6 to both sides, we get 6a = 186. Dividing both sides by 6, we find a = 31.

Now we can find the measure of angle CFD: 4a - 1 = 4(31) - 1 = 124 - 1 = 123 degrees.
And the measure of angle AFD: 2a - 5 = 2(31) - 5 = 62 - 5 = 57 degrees.

Since the sum of angles AFB, BFC, CFD, and DFA is 360 degrees, and angle BFC is given as 72 degrees, we have:
AFB + BFC + CFD + DFA = 360
AFB + 72 + 123 + 57 = 360
AFB + 252 = 360
AFB = 360 - 252
AFB = 108 degrees.

Final Answer: B
