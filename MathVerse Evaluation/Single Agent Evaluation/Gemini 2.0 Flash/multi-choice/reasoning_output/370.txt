The given triangle is a right-angled triangle. Let the length of the side adjacent to angle $\theta$ be $x$.
The length of the side opposite to angle $\theta$ is given as 4.
The length of the hypotenuse is given as $4\sqrt{2}$.
We can use trigonometric ratios to find the angle $\theta$.
We know that $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$, and $\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$.
In this case, we have $\sin(\theta) = \frac{4}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
Also, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $4^2 + x^2 = (4\sqrt{2})^2$, so $16 + x^2 = 16(2) = 32$.
Thus, $x^2 = 32 - 16 = 16$, so $x = \sqrt{16} = 4$.
So we have $\cos(\theta) = \frac{4}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
Also, $\tan(\theta) = \frac{4}{4} = 1$.
Since $\sin(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\cos(\theta) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$, we know that $\theta = 45^\circ$.
Alternatively, since $\tan(\theta) = 1$, we know that $\theta = 45^\circ$.
