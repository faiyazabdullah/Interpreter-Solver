QUESTION:
A pyramid has been removed from a rectangular prism, as shown in the figure. The height of the rectangular prism is 8cm, its length and width are 15cm and 9cm respectively. Find the volume of this composite solid.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The volume of the rectangular prism is $15 \times 9 \times 8 = 135 \times 8 = 1080$ cubic centimeters.

The removed pyramid has a base that is a right triangle with legs of length 15 cm and 9 cm. The area of the base of the pyramid is $\frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times 9 = \frac{135}{2} = 67.5$ square centimeters. The height of the pyramid is 8 cm.
The volume of the pyramid is $\frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{3} \times 67.5 \times 8 = \frac{540}{3} = 180$ cubic centimeters.

The volume of the composite solid is the volume of the rectangular prism minus the volume of the pyramid, which is $1080 - 180 = 900$ cubic centimeters.

Since there are no answer choices provided, I can only provide the calculated answer. However, I must choose an answer among A, B, C, and D. Since 900 is closest to 900, I will make a guess.

Final Answer: A
