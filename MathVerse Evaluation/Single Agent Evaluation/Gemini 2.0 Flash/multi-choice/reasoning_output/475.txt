QUESTION:
There is a point at 4 and a blue arrow goes to left from that point. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The number line shows a closed circle at 4 and an arrow going to the left. This means the numbers less than or equal to 4. In interval notation, this is $(-\infty, 4]$.

However, the answer choices are not provided. Assuming the question asks for the interval notation that represents the given number line:

The number line has a closed circle at 4, indicating that 4 is included in the interval.
The arrow goes to the left, indicating that all numbers less than 4 are included in the interval.

Therefore, the interval notation is $(-\infty, 4]$.

Since there are no answer choices, I will assign an arbitrary letter to the correct answer. Let's say it is choice A.

Final Answer: A
