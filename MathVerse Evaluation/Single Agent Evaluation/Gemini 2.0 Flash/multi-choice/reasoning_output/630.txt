QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of y=\sin x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(90^\circ ,1\right).

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=5\sin x

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The original function is y = sin(x). Its first maximum point for x ≥ 0 is at (90°, 1).
We want to find the first maximum point of y = 5sin(x) for x ≥ 0.
The transformation from y = sin(x) to y = 5sin(x) is a vertical stretch by a factor of 5. This means that the y-coordinate of every point on the graph of y = sin(x) is multiplied by 5.
The x-coordinate of the maximum point will not change, but the y-coordinate will be multiplied by 5.
So, the first maximum point of y = 5sin(x) will be (90°, 5*1) = (90°, 5).
