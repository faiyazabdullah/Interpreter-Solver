Let's analyze the given figure. We are given a right triangle ABF on top of a rectangle CDEF. We are asked to find the measure of angle CFD, labeled as angle 2.

Since CDEF is a rectangle, all its angles are 90 degrees. In particular, angles C, D, E, and F are all right angles. This means that angle CFE is 90 degrees.
Angle AFD is a straight line, so it is 180 degrees.
Also, angle AFB is a right angle because triangle ABF is a right triangle.
We are given that angle ABF is 48 degrees.
Since the sum of angles in triangle ABF is 180 degrees, and angle AFB is 90 degrees, angle BAF = 180 - 90 - 48 = 42 degrees.
Since angle AFE is a right angle, it is 90 degrees.
Angle AFD is made up of angles AFB + angle BFC + angle CFD.
We have angle AFB = 90 degrees.
Since BC is parallel to FE, angle CBF = 0.
Also, angle FCD is 90 degrees, and angle FDE is 90 degrees.
We are given that angle EDF is 39 degrees.
We are trying to find angle CFD. Since angle FCD = 90 degrees, and angle CDF = 39 degrees. Therefore, angle CFD = 180 - 90 - 39 = 51 degrees.
Therefore, angle CFD = 51 degrees.
