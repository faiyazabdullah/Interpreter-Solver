QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The curve passes through the points (-4,0), (0,2) and (4,0). The points (-4,0) and (4,0) are solid points, which means they are included in the domain and range.

The domain is the set of all possible x-values. From the graph, we can see that the curve exists for x-values between -4 and 4, inclusive. Therefore, the domain is [-4, 4].

The range is the set of all possible y-values. From the graph, we can see that the y-values range from 0 to 2, inclusive. Therefore, the range is [0, 2].

Final Answer: A
