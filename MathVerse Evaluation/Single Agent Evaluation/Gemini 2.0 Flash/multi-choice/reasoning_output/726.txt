GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The volume of the prism is given by the area of the cross section multiplied by the depth. The cross section is a trapezium with parallel sides of length 7cm and 16cm and height 2cm. The area of the trapezium is given by $\frac{1}{2} (a+b) h$ where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the parallel sides and $h$ is the perpendicular distance between them. Thus the area of the cross section is $\frac{1}{2} (7+16) \times 2 = 23$ cm$^2$. The depth of the prism is 13 cm. Therefore the volume of the prism is $23 \times 13 = 299$ cm$^3$.
