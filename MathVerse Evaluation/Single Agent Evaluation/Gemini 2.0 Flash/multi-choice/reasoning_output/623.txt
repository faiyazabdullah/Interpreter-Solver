QUESTION:
Two piecewirse function $g$ and $f$ are graphed, $g$ is graphed in purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), $f$ is graphed in blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). t is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport.
The airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon.

The problem asks for the other time, besides 9 minutes, when the two airplanes have the same height. This is equivalent to finding the t-value where the two graphs intersect, other than approximately t=9. By visually inspecting the graphs of $f$ and $g$, we see that they intersect near t=100. More precisely, $f$ goes from (0,0) to (10,11000), and then stays at 11000 until around t=50. Between t=0 and t=10, $f(t)$ is $1100t$. Then $f(t)=11000$. Then between t=50 and t=60, $f(t)$ decreases. At t=60, $f(t)=10000$. Then until t=100, $f(t)=10000$. Then $f(t)$ begins to decrease.

$g$ goes through (0,10000) and (40,9000). So between t=0 and t=40, the line is $g(t) = 10000 - \frac{1000}{40}t = 10000 - 25t$. Then $g(t)=9000$ between t=40 and t=80. Then $g(t)$ increases to $g(100)=11000$.
So g(t) increases. $g(80)=9000$, $g(100)=11000$. The line is $g(t) = 9000 + \frac{2000}{20}(t-80) = 9000+100(t-80) = 9000+100t-8000=100t+1000$. So when $100<t<100$, $f(t)$ is decreasing from 10000, and $g(t)$ is increasing from 9000 to 11000. At approximately t=100, both functions have a value of 10000.

At approximately 100 minutes, $f(100) = 10000$ and $g(100) = 11000$. This is close, but no intersection happens at approximately 100 minutes. Around 9 minutes, we said they have the same height. So at t=9, $f(9) = 11000$.
Around t=100, the graphs intersect. After t=100, g(t)=11000 and $f(t)$ begins to go down to 0. The graph intersects $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ around 100 minutes.
So round to the nearest 10 minutes, we get 100 minutes.
