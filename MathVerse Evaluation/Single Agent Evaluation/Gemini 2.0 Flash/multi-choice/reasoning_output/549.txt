QUESTION:
Takoda is watching the tides off the coast of Cape Cod. For two days, Takoda records the height of the water, $h$, in feet. His results are shown in the graph below, where $t$ corresponds to the number of hours after 12:00 a.m. According to Takoda's research, approximately how much time passes between two consecutive high tides?

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The graph shows the height of the water, $h$, in feet, as a function of time, $t$, in hours. The high tides occur at the peaks of the graph. We need to find the time between two consecutive high tides, which is the period of the function.

From the graph, we can see that the first high tide occurs around $t=4$ hours. The next high tide occurs around $t=16$ hours. The time between these two high tides is approximately $16 - 4 = 12$ hours.

The next high tide occurs around $t=28$ hours. The time between the second and third high tides is approximately $28 - 16 = 12$ hours.

The next high tide occurs around $t=40$ hours. The time between the third and fourth high tides is approximately $40 - 28 = 12$ hours.

Thus, the time between two consecutive high tides is approximately 12 hours.
