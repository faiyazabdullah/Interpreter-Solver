QUESTION:
There is a function representing a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1 unit. Points A,B, and C are plotted on the unit circle. Which of the coordinates is equal to \sin \left(310^{\circ}\right) ?

CHOICES:
A:x-coordinate of point A
B:y-coordinate of point A
C:x-coordinate of point B
D:y-coordinate of point B
E:x-coordinate of point C
F:y-coordinate of point C

The coordinates of a point on the unit circle at an angle $\theta$ from the positive x-axis are given by $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$. Therefore, we need to find the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle corresponding to an angle of $310^\circ$.
Point A is in the first quadrant, so its coordinates are positive.
Point B is in the second quadrant, so its x-coordinate is negative and its y-coordinate is positive.
Point C is in the fourth quadrant, so its x-coordinate is positive and its y-coordinate is negative.

Since $310^\circ$ is in the fourth quadrant ($270^\circ < 310^\circ < 360^\circ$), the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle will be negative.
Point C appears to be located at approximately $310^\circ$ based on the graph. Therefore, the y-coordinate of point C will be $\sin(310^\circ)$.
