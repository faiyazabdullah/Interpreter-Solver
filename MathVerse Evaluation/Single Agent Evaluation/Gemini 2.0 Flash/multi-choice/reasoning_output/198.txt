The given figure is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 13 and a base of length 10. The height of the triangle is not given, but it is represented by a dashed line. We need to find the area of the triangle.

First, we need to calculate the height of the triangle. Since the triangle is isosceles, the height bisects the base. This means the base is divided into two segments of length 5. Now we have a right triangle with hypotenuse 13 and one leg of length 5. Let the height be h. Using the Pythagorean theorem:
$5^2 + h^2 = 13^2$
$25 + h^2 = 169$
$h^2 = 169 - 25$
$h^2 = 144$
$h = \sqrt{144}$
$h = 12$

Now that we know the height (h = 12) and the base (b = 10), we can calculate the area of the triangle:
Area = (1/2) * base * height
Area = (1/2) * 10 * 12
Area = 5 * 12
Area = 60

The area of the triangle is 60.
Comparing our calculated answer with the given answer choices:
A: 30
B: 60
C: 120
D: 240
Our calculated area is 60, which matches answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
