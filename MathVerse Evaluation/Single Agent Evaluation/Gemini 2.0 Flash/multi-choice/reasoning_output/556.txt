The image shows a unit circle. The coordinates of a point on the circle are given as (0.2, 0.98). The angle $\theta$ is formed by the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (0.2, 0.98). We are given that $\tan(\theta) = \frac{0.98}{0.2} = 4.9$. We are asked to evaluate certain expressions. Since no expressions were given to evaluate, I cannot proceed.
