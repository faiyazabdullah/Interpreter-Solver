The problem states that point B is due East of point A. We are given a triangle ABC where angle A is 49 degrees and angle B is 39 degrees. We need to find the true bearing of point A from point C.

First, we find angle C of triangle ABC.
Angle C = 180 - (Angle A + Angle B)
Angle C = 180 - (49 + 39)
Angle C = 180 - 88
Angle C = 92 degrees

Now, we need to find the bearing of C from A. Since B is due East of A, the North direction at point A is a vertical line pointing upwards. The angle between the North direction and the line AC is 49 degrees. So, the bearing of C from A is 180 + 49 = 229 degrees.

Now consider the North direction at point C. We need to find the bearing of A from C.  Since we know angle C is 92 degrees. We know that bearing of A from C is the angle measured clockwise from North to the line CA.  Let's call this angle x.
The bearing of C from A is 229 degrees. Thus, the bearing of A from C will be 229 - 180 = 49 degrees.
Using the properties of angles, if we extend the line AC past A to a point P, then the angle between North and AP at A is 49. Now at C, if we draw the North arrow upwards and CA is the line, since angle ACB is 92, the bearing of A from C must be the angle from North rotated clockwise.
Let the North direction at C be along the y-axis. We are looking for the angle between the y-axis and CA. The angle between CA and South is 180 - x = 229, thus angle CAB is 49. The angles in a triangle ABC equals to 180. C is at the bottom so point A from C equals 49. Angle ACB is 92 degrees. The North direction lies vertically straight. To calculate the bearing of A from C:
If point C was directly below point A then we can find the angle from C. But point C is in between point A and point B. So the North at C we can use the rule is to determine the angle which is 360 - angle. The triangle angle at point C is 92, using 360 - 92 = 268 degrees. Also 180 + angle A = 180+49 which equals 229 is from C bearing to A. Then angle North from point C to angle CA is found to be: 360 - 229= 131 degrees.
From the point C, North to CA will be 360 minus the bearing angle of C from A. This would be 360 - 49 = 311. 311 is too high based on the information from the question.

The bearing of A from C can be calculated by considering the angle at C and the orientation of the North direction at C. The angle ACB is 92 degrees.
We can use the sine rule here:
a / sinA = b / sinB = c / sinC

The bearing from point C to point A needs more clarity based on triangle shapes and direction using known value using angle. This means the question might require additional values on direction for a good solution.
