QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function going through points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph represents a piecewise function. The leftmost point appears to be at x = -3, and the graph continues to the right, ending with an arrow which indicates that it continues infinitely. Therefore, the domain is [-3, ∞).

The lowest y-value on the graph is y = 0, occurring at x = -3. The y-values increase to y = 5 at x = 0, and the function remains at y = 5 until x = 3. The arrow shows that the function continues to rise, so the range extends to infinity. Thus, the range is [0, ∞).

Final Answer: A
