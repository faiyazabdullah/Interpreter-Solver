The quadrilateral ABCD is composed of two right-angled triangles ABC and ACD.
Angle B is 35 degrees. Angle BCD is a right angle, i.e., 90 degrees. The length of BC is 13.
We need to find the size of angle ACD.
In triangle ABC, angle ACB = 90 - angle B = 90 - 35 = 55 degrees.
Since angle BCD is 90 degrees, we have angle ACD = angle BCD - angle ACB = 90 - 55 = 35 degrees.
