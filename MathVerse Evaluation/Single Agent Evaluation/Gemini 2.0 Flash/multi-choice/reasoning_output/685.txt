QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The longest straw that can fit into the can would be the diagonal of a rectangle with height equal to the height of the can and width equal to the diameter of the can. The height of the can is 13 cm and the radius is 3 cm, so the diameter is 2*3 = 6 cm.
The length of the straw L can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
L^2 = height^2 + diameter^2
L^2 = 13^2 + 6^2
L^2 = 169 + 36
L^2 = 205
L = sqrt(205)
L â‰ˆ 14.3178
Rounded down to the nearest cm, the length of the straw is 14 cm.

Since there are no answer choices given, I will assume the possible answers are integers.

Final Answer: A
