QUESTION:
In order to measure the height of the school flagpole AC, a school math interest group erected a benchmark DF with a length of 1.5 at point F. As shown in the figure, the length of the shadow EF of DF is measured as 1.0, and then measure the length of the shadow BC of the flagpole AC to be 6.0, then the height of the flagpole AC is ()

CHOICES:
A:6米
B:7米
C:8.5米
D:9米

According to the problem description, we know that DF and AC are both perpendicular to the ground. Therefore, the triangles formed by DF and its shadow EF, and AC and its shadow BC, are similar triangles.
So, DF/EF = AC/BC, which means 1.5/1 = AC/6.
From this, we can calculate AC = (1.5/1) * 6 = 1.5 * 6 = 9.
