QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\cos a$.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

The angle $a$ is in standard position, and the terminal side intersects the circle at point $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The circle has its center at the origin and a radius of 1.
We need to find the value of $\cos a$.

Since the coordinates of the point $P$ on the unit circle are given as $(x, y) = \left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$, we can use the definitions of cosine and sine in terms of the coordinates of a point on the unit circle. We have:
$\cos a = x$ and $\sin a = y$

Therefore, $\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}$.

Since no answer choices are given, we cannot compare our result with them. However, we have found the value of $\cos a$ based on the given information.

Final Answer: A
