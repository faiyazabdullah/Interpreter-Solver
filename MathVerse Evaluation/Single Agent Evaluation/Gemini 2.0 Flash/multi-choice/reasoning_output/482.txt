QUESTION:
There is a line goes through a hollow point (2,8) and a solid point (8,6). Write the domain and range of each function using interval notation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows a line segment. The left endpoint is an open circle at (2, 8), and the right endpoint is a closed circle at (8, 6).

The domain is the set of x-values for which the function is defined. Since the line segment starts at x=2 (not included) and ends at x=8 (included), the domain is (2, 8].

The range is the set of y-values for which the function is defined. Since the line segment starts at y=8 (not included) and ends at y=6 (included), the range is (6, 8].

Final Answer: A
