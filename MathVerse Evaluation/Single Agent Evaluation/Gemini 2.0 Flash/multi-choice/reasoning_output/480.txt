QUESTION:
There are 4 labels on the x-axis $-\pi$, $-\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\pi$ and a curve that goes through ($\frac{2}{\pi}$,0). Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A:This is a one-to-one function
B:This is not a one-to-one function

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
A function is one-to-one if it passes the horizontal line test. This means that any horizontal line drawn on the graph intersects the graph at most once. In this case, a horizontal line can intersect the curve more than once. For example, the horizontal line y = 0.5 intersects the curve in more than one place. Therefore, this is not a one-to-one function.

Final Answer: B
