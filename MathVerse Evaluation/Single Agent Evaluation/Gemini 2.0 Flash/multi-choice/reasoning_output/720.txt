The volumes of the two cylinders are given as 5760 cm³ and 90 cm³. The problem asks to find the ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder in its simplest form.

Ratio = Volume of larger cylinder / Volume of smaller cylinder
Ratio = 5760 / 90

To simplify the ratio, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.
5760 / 90 = 576 / 9
Now, we can see that both numbers are divisible by 9.
576 / 9 = 64
9 / 9 = 1
So the ratio is 64/1 or 64:1.
