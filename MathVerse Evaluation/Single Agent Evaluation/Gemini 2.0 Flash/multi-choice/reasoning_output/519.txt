QUESTION:
The function $f(x)=5 x-x^2$ in blue gives the number of mosquitos in the forest (in millions), and the function $g(x)=3 x-0.5 x^2$ in red gives the number of bats (in millions). In both equations $x$ represents rainfall (in centimeters). $g(x)$ goes through (0,0), (3,6), (6,0) and opens downward. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,0), (2,6), (3,6), (5,0) and opens downsward. When there is $0 \mathrm{~cm}$ of rainfall, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats. What is another rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats?
Round your answer to the nearest half centimeter.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem states that the number of mosquitos is given by $f(x) = 5x - x^2$ and the number of bats is given by $g(x) = 3x - 0.5x^2$, where $x$ is the rainfall in centimeters. We want to find the rainfall amount $x$ where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats, i.e., $f(x) = g(x)$.
So we set the two equations equal to each other:
$5x - x^2 = 3x - 0.5x^2$
Subtract $3x$ from both sides:
$2x - x^2 = -0.5x^2$
Add $x^2$ to both sides:
$2x = 0.5x^2$
Subtract $2x$ from both sides:
$0 = 0.5x^2 - 2x$
Factor out an $x$:
$0 = x(0.5x - 2)$
So either $x = 0$ or $0.5x - 2 = 0$.
If $0.5x - 2 = 0$, then $0.5x = 2$, which means $x = 2 / 0.5 = 4$.
The problem tells us that when $x=0$, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats, which we already found as one solution. We want to find another rainfall amount, so we take $x = 4$.

Therefore, the rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats is $4 \mathrm{~cm}$.
