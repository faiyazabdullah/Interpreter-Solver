QUESTION:
This is a quadratic function. The y-axis labels mosquitoes (millions), and x-axis labels rainfall (centimeters). The vertex of the function is (2,4) and the function intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (4,0). Which of these statements are true?

CHOICES:
A:The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 2 million mosquitoes.
B:The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 4 million mosquitoes.
C:More rainfall always relates to less mosquitoes.
D:More rainfall relates to less mosquitoes as long as rainfall is less than $2 \mathrm{~cm}$.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows a parabola with a vertex at (2,4). This represents the maximum point of the quadratic function.

A: The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 2 million mosquitoes.
This statement is false. The vertex of the graph is at y=4, indicating that the largest possible number of mosquitoes is 4 million.

B: The largest possible number of mosquitoes is 4 million mosquitoes.
This statement is true because the vertex of the parabola is at (2,4).

C: More rainfall always relates to less mosquitoes.
This statement is false. From 0 cm to 2 cm rainfall, an increase in rainfall leads to an increase in the number of mosquitoes.

D: More rainfall relates to less mosquitoes as long as rainfall is less than $2 \mathrm{~cm}$.
This statement is false. From 0 to 2 cm, more rainfall relates to more mosquitoes. For rainfall greater than 2 cm, more rainfall relates to fewer mosquitoes.

The only true statement is B.
