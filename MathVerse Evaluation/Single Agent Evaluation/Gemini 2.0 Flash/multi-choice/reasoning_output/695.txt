The solid is a sector of a cylinder.
The thickness is the height of the cylinder, which is 3 cm.
The angle of the sector is given as 42 degrees, which should be 45 degrees, according to the question.
The radius of the larger sector is 9 cm and the radius of the smaller sector is 3 cm.
The volume of the larger sector is
$$V_1 = \frac{42}{360} \times \pi \times 9^2 \times 3 = \frac{42}{360} \times \pi \times 81 \times 3 = \frac{42}{360} \times 763.407 = 89.063$$
The volume of the smaller sector is
$$V_2 = \frac{42}{360} \times \pi \times 3^2 \times 3 = \frac{42}{360} \times \pi \times 9 \times 3 = \frac{42}{360} \times 84.823 = 9.913$$
The difference between them is $V_1 - V_2 = 89.063 - 9.913 = 79.15$.

The angle of the sector is given as 45 degrees.
The radius of the larger sector is 9 cm and the radius of the smaller sector is 3 cm.
The volume of the larger sector is
$$V_1 = \frac{45}{360} \times \pi \times 9^2 \times 3 = \frac{1}{8} \times \pi \times 81 \times 3 = \frac{1}{8} \times 763.407 = 95.426$$
The volume of the smaller sector is
$$V_2 = \frac{45}{360} \times \pi \times 3^2 \times 3 = \frac{1}{8} \times \pi \times 9 \times 3 = \frac{1}{8} \times 84.823 = 10.603$$
The difference between them is $V_1 - V_2 = 95.426 - 10.603 = 84.823$.

The volume of the sector is
$$V = \frac{\theta}{360} \pi h (R^2 - r^2)$$
$$V = \frac{42}{360} \pi (3) (9^2 - 3^2)$$
$$V = \frac{42}{360} \pi (3) (81 - 9)$$
$$V = \frac{42}{360} \pi (3) (72)$$
$$V = \frac{42}{360} \pi (216)$$
$$V = \frac{42}{360} (678.58)$$
$$V = 79.16$$
If we assume that the angle is 45°, then
$$V = \frac{45}{360} \pi (3) (9^2 - 3^2)$$
$$V = \frac{45}{360} \pi (3) (81 - 9)$$
$$V = \frac{45}{360} \pi (3) (72)$$
$$V = \frac{1}{8} \pi (216)$$
$$V = \frac{1}{8} (678.58)$$
$$V = 84.82$$
$V = 84.8$
