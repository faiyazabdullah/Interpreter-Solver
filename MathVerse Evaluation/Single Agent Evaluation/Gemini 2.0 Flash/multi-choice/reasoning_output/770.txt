QUESTION:
In the figure above, the seven small circles, which have equal radii, and the large circle share only those points on the circles that are marked. Point P is the center of the large circle and PA and PB are radii. The area of the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles?

Let the radius of each small circle be $r$. Then the radius of the large circle is $3r$. The area of one small circle is $\pi r^2$.
The shaded area consists of two sectors.
The sector centered at A is one-half of a small circle, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2$.
To find the area of the other sector, we need to find the angle $\angle BPA$. Since the seven small circles are arranged symmetrically, the angle formed by the centers of the small circles at P is $\frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ$.
The sector centered at the circle to the right of the center small circle has an angle of $60^\circ$. Thus, the area of this sector is $\frac{60^\circ}{360^\circ} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2$.
Therefore, the total shaded area is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 + \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{3}{6} \pi r^2 + \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{4}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2$.
Let the area of the shaded portion be $x$ times the area of one small circle.
Then $\frac{2}{3} \pi r^2 = x \pi r^2$, so $x = \frac{2}{3}$.
However, the sector centered at P has a central angle of $\frac{1}{6}$ of the entire circle. Thus, the shaded area is $\frac{1}{6} \pi r^2$.
The area of one sector is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2$.
The other sector has radius $r$ and the angle is $60^\circ$. So the area is $\frac{60}{360} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2$.
The total area is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 + \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{3+1}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{4}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2$.
Then $\frac{\frac{2}{3} \pi r^2}{\pi r^2} = \frac{2}{3}$.
The question asks for the area of the shaded portion. The area of the sector at A is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2$. The area of the sector at B is $\frac{60}{360} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2$.
Total area is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 + \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{3+1}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{4}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2$.
The area of the shaded portion is $\frac{2}{3}$ times the area of one of the small circles.
The area of each small circle is $\pi r^2$.

The diagram shows the shaded region comprising of a semi-circle and a sector of a circle with central angle 60 degrees. The total area of the shaded region is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 + \frac{60}{360} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 + \frac{1}{6} \pi r^2 = (\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6}) \pi r^2 = \frac{4}{6} \pi r^2 = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2$
Therefore, the area of the shaded region is $\frac{2}{3}$ times the area of one small circle. There appears to be an error in the question since none of the provided options are $\frac{2}{3}$. Since it is most appropriate, if we convert our answer to a whole number, we can say that the area of shaded portion is zero times the area of one of the small circles. However, we are looking for the most likely answer. Since each of the small circles are the same and it is not specified that we are looking for a number equal to or greater than one, we can assume it to be a different number.
