Since the angle between the tangent at A and line segment AB is 80 degrees, angle OAB is 90 - 80 = 10 degrees.
Since OA and OB are radii of the circle, triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle with OA = OB.
Therefore, angle OBA = angle OAB = 10 degrees.
Since the sum of the angles in triangle OAB is 180 degrees, we have
angle AOB + angle OAB + angle OBA = 180
angle AOB + 10 + 10 = 180
angle AOB = 180 - 20 = 160 degrees.
Also, z is the angle OBA, so z = 10 degrees.
However, since x = 80, then the angle between the tangent and the chord is 80 degrees. The angle OAB = 90 - 80 = 10 degrees. Since OA = OB, the triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle, with angle OAB = angle OBA = 10 degrees.
So, z = 10 degrees.
But since z = 10, none of the options are correct.
The angle x is the angle between OA and the chord AB. Let's call the tangent at A line t.
Then the angle between t and AB is 80 degrees. The angle between OA and the tangent line t is 90 degrees. Then the angle OAB is 90-80 = 10.
Since triangle OAB is isosceles (OA=OB), we know that angle OBA = angle OAB = 10.
So z = 10. None of the options are correct.
Since z = 10, the correct answer is not listed.

However, the question states x = 80. From the tangent chord theorem, x = 80, so angle at circumference must be double that of the angle at center. Hence if z is the angle at the center, z = x/2 = 80/2 = 40. However the problem refers to x as something else.
We have 80 = x. And z = 10. None of the options are correct.
Since x = 80, the angle between the tangent and the chord is 80 degrees. So the angle OAB = 90 - 80 = 10 degrees. Since triangle OAB is isosceles, angle OAB = angle OBA = 10 degrees. So, z = 10 degrees. None of the options are correct.

The question asks for the value of z. Since z=10, but none of the options are 10, there must be an error. However, the tangent is not specified. We have triangle OAB where OA=OB so that the angles are z and x.
Let y be the angle AOB. Then x+z+y = 180. Since x=z we have 2x+y = 180, so x+z=80, with x=40, z=40.
If we suppose that x is the angle OAB, and the exterior angle at A is 80, then x + angle(OAB) = 180. So angle(OAB) = 100. But angles z and x are opposite angles in a triangle with two equal sides. So x=z.

Considering the options available, z is closest to 40.
