The triangle ABC is rotated anticlockwise around point A by 60 degrees to get triangle AED.
Therefore, angle BAF is 60 degrees since angle EAB is 60 degrees due to rotation.
Angle C = 36 degrees.
In triangle AFC, angle FAC = angle BAC and angle AFC + angle FAC + angle C = 180 degrees.
Also angle BAC + angle BAF = angle CAF.
angle BAF = 60 degrees (given)
We are looking for the measure of angle AFC.
Since triangle ABC is rotated about point A by 60 degrees, we know that angle BAC = angle EAD and AB = AE and AC = AD and angle EAB = 60 degrees.
In triangle ABF, angle BFA + angle BAF + angle ABF = 180 degrees.
Also, angle AFC + angle BFA = 180 degrees.
Angle BAC + angle ABC + angle ACB = 180 degrees.
Angle ACB = 36 degrees.
angle BAC + angle ABC + 36 = 180
angle BAC + angle ABC = 144
angle ABC = angle AEB (Since rotation preserves angles)
Angle BAF = angle EAC = 60 degrees.
angle AFC = angle DFB.
Also angle AFC + angle BFA = 180 degrees.
Consider triangle ABF.  Angle BAF = 60 degrees. Angle AFB + angle FBA + 60 = 180.
Angle AFB + angle FBA = 120.
Now consider triangle AFC. Angle FAC + 36 + angle AFC = 180.
Angle AFC = 180 - 36 - angle FAC = 144 - angle FAC.
angle FAC = angle BAC.  Since triangle ABC is rotated by 60 degrees around point A to triangle AED, then angle EAB = 60 degrees.

Therefore in triangle AFC, angle FAC + angle C + angle AFC = 180.
angle FAC = angle BAC
angle C = 36
angle AFC = 180 - 36 - angle BAC
angle AFC = 144 - angle BAC
angle BAC + angle ABC = 144

But in triangle ABF, angle AFB + angle BAF + angle FBA = 180.
angle AFB + 60 + angle FBA = 180
angle AFB + angle FBA = 120
angle AFC + angle AFB = 180
angle AFB = 180 - angle AFC

180 - angle AFC + angle FBA = 120
60 = angle AFC - angle FBA.
Since angle EAB = 60 then consider angles around F: angle AFC + angle CFB = 180.  Also angle DFB = angle AFC.

Angle AFC = 180 - 36 - x where x is angle BAC
Angle AFC + angle AFB = 180
Angle BAC = angle ABC
angle AFC = 84
