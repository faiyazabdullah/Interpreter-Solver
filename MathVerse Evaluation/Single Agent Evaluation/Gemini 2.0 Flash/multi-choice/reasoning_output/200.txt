QUESTION:
There is an isosceles triangle with side length 32. The base angle is 54 degrees. x is half of the base. Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.

CHOICES:

B:23.2
C:25.9
D:44.0

The triangle shown is isosceles, and we are given that one of the equal sides has a length of 32. We are also given that one of the base angles is 54 degrees. We want to find the value of x, where x is half the length of the base. Since the triangle is isosceles, the altitude to the base also bisects the base.
We can use trigonometry to solve for x.
We have cos(54) = x/32.
Therefore, x = 32*cos(54)
x ≈ 32 * 0.587785
x ≈ 18.809
Rounding to the nearest tenth, x ≈ 18.8
