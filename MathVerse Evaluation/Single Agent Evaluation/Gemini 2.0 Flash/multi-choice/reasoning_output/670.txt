QUESTION:
A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm. We wish to find the surface area of the entire solid. Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object.
What is the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism? Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

The solid is composed of a cylinder attached to a rectangular prism.
The dimensions of the rectangular prism are 21mm, 10mm, and 65mm.
The radius of the cylinder is 5mm, and its height is 11mm.

We want to find the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism.
The total surface area of the rectangular prism is given by
$2(lw + lh + wh)$
where $l=65$, $w=21$, and $h=10$.
So, the total surface area of the rectangular prism is
$2(65\times 21 + 65\times 10 + 21\times 10) = 2(1365 + 650 + 210) = 2(2225) = 4450 \text{ mm}^2$.

The cylinder is attached to one of the faces of the rectangular prism.
The area of the circular base of the cylinder is $\pi r^2 = \pi (5^2) = 25\pi$.
The area of the circle that is covering the rectangular prism is $25\pi \approx 25 \times 3.14159 = 78.53975 \text{ mm}^2$.
The exposed surface area of the rectangular prism is the total surface area minus the area covered by the cylinder.
$4450 - 25\pi = 4450 - 78.53975 = 4371.46025 \text{ mm}^2$.

However, the surface area of the rectangular prism that the cylinder covers must be subtracted. Since the face on which the cylinder sits is the 21mm x 65mm rectangle, the area of that rectangle is $21\times 65 = 1365$. When attaching the cylinder to this face, the area that is covered by the cylinder is $25\pi$. So, the area of this face that is exposed is $1365 - 25\pi$.
The other faces have full area exposure: $2(65 \times 10) + 2(21\times 10) + 1(21 \times 65) - 1(25\pi)$.
So the exposed surface area is
$2(650) + 2(210) + 1(1365) - 1(25\pi) = 1300 + 420 + 1365 - 25\pi = 3085 - 25\pi = 3085 - 78.5398 = 3006.4602 \text{ mm}^2$.

The exposed surface area of the rectangular prism is the total surface area of the rectangular prism minus the area of the circle covered by the base of the cylinder.
The total surface area of the rectangular prism is $2(21 \times 65 + 21 \times 10 + 65 \times 10) = 2(1365 + 210 + 650) = 2(2225) = 4450$.
However, the area of the circle covers one of the rectangles (21mm x 65mm). Thus, we have an area of $1365$ there.
The circular area is $25\pi$. Thus, the exposed area is $1365 - 25\pi \approx 1365 - 78.54 \approx 1286.46$.
The remaining areas are $21 \times 10 = 210$ and $65 \times 10 = 650$.
Then the other such areas so, $2 \times 210 + 2 \times 650 = 420 + 1300 = 1720$.
The total area exposed is $1286.46 + 1720 = 3006.46$.
