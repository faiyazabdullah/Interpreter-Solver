QUESTION:
A man stands at point A looking at the top of two poles. Pole 1 has height 8 m and angle of elevation 34^\circ  and Pole 2 has height 25 m and angle of elevation 57^\circ . The man wishes to find the distance between the two poles.
Hence find BC, the distance between the two poles in metres.

Round your answer to one decimal place.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let x be the distance from point A to Pole 1 (AB), and y be the distance from point A to Pole 2 (AC).
We have tan(34°) = 8/x and tan(57°) = 25/y.
Therefore, x = 8/tan(34°) and y = 25/tan(57°).
Using a calculator, tan(34°) ≈ 0.6745 and tan(57°) ≈ 1.5399.
x ≈ 8/0.6745 ≈ 11.859
y ≈ 25/1.5399 ≈ 16.235
We are looking for the distance between the two poles, BC, which is y - x.
BC = y - x ≈ 16.235 - 11.859 ≈ 4.376
Rounding to one decimal place, BC ≈ 4.4 m.
