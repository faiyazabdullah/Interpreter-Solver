QUESTION:
Elena knows that Lea has a garden with an area of 100 square meters. She does not know the specific width, $w$, and length, $l$ of the garden. The graph below represents the widths that correspond to possible lengths of Lea's garden, which decreases when $w$ increases and goes through (5,20), (10,10), (20,5). As the possible width of Lea's garden increases, what does its possible length approach?

CHOICES:
A:$\infty$
B:$\hline 0$
C:$\hline 10$
D:$\hline 120$

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem states that the area of Lea's garden is 100 square meters. Since the area of a rectangle is length times width ($A = l \times w$), we have $l \times w = 100$. This means that $l = \frac{100}{w}$.
The question asks what the possible length approaches as the possible width increases.
As $w$ increases, the fraction $\frac{100}{w}$ approaches 0.
Looking at the graph, as $w$ increases (moves to the right), $l$ decreases and appears to approach 0.

Final Answer: B
