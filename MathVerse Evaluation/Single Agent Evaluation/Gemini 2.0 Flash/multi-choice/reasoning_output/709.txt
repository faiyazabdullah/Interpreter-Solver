The surface area of the square pyramid is the area of the square base plus the area of the four triangular faces.
The area of the square base is $10 \text{ cm} \times 10 \text{ cm} = 100 \text{ cm}^2$.
The height of each triangular face can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The height is the hypotenuse, one leg is the perpendicular height of the pyramid which is 6 cm. The other leg is half the length of the base, which is $10 \text{ cm} / 2 = 5 \text{ cm}$.
The height of the triangle is $\sqrt{6^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{36 + 25} = \sqrt{61} \approx 7.81 \text{ cm}$.
The area of one triangular face is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \text{ cm} \times \sqrt{61} \text{ cm} = 5\sqrt{61} \approx 39.05 \text{ cm}^2$.
The area of the four triangular faces is $4 \times 5\sqrt{61} \approx 4 \times 39.05 = 156.2 \text{ cm}^2$.
The total surface area of the square pyramid is the area of the base plus the area of the four triangular faces, which is $100 + 156.2 = 256.2 \text{ cm}^2$.
