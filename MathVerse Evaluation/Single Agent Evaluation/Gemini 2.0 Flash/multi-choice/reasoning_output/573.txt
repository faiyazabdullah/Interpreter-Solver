GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The function f(x) = x^2 has its vertex at (0, 0). The graph of g(x) is a translation of f(x).
By looking at the graph, we can observe that the vertex of g(x) is at (-3, 1).
The general form of a quadratic function is a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex.
In this case, the vertex of g(x) is (-3, 1), so h = -3 and k = 1. Also, the coefficient a is 1 because the parabola opens upwards and has the same width as f(x) = x^2.
Thus, the equation for g(x) is g(x) = 1(x - (-3))^2 + 1 = (x + 3)^2 + 1.
Expanding this, we get g(x) = x^2 + 6x + 9 + 1 = x^2 + 6x + 10.
So the equation for g(x) is (x + 3)^2 + 1.
