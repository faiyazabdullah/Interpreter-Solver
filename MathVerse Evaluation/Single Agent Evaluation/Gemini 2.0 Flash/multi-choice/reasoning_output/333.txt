QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 37Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The true bearing of P from M is the angle measured clockwise from North to the line MP. The bearing of S from M is 180 degrees.
The angle PMS is given as 37 degrees.
The angle between North and MP is given as 323 degrees.
The angle between North and MS (South) is 180 degrees.
So, the angle between MP and MS is equal to 323 - 180 = 143 degrees.
We are given that the angle PMS is 37 degrees.
Therefore, the angle between the North direction and MP is 323 degrees, which is the true bearing of P from M.
