GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The true bearing of A from O is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction to the line OA. The angle between the south direction and line OA is 32°.
Since the angle between the north and south direction is 180°, the angle between the north direction and line OA is 180° + 32° = 212°.

Final Answer: A
