GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The line passes through the points (0, 5) and (2.5, 0).
The y-intercept is 5.
The slope of the line is given by the change in y divided by the change in x:
m = (0 - 5) / (2.5 - 0) = -5 / 2.5 = -2

The equation of the line is in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
In this case, m = -2 and b = 5.
So the equation of the line is y = -2x + 5.

y = -2 x + 5
