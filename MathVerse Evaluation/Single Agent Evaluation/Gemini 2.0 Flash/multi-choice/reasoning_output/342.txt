The diagram shows a triangle ABC with angle A = 38° and angle B = 49°. We need to find the true bearing of point C from point B.

First, we can find angle C in triangle ABC. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so angle C = 180° - 38° - 49° = 180° - 87° = 93°.

The true bearing of B is North. We are looking for the bearing of C from B.
At point B, we have a north direction represented by the up arrow. The angle between the line BC and the line pointing due west from B is 49°.  The bearing of C from B is the angle measured clockwise from the North direction to the line segment BC.  Since the angle ABC is 49 degrees, this is the angle between the line AB and the line BC.  The angle from North to the line AB is 180 degrees. So we consider 360 degrees - this direction.

The angle from North to the line AB is 180 degrees from point B.  The angle from AB to BC is 49 degrees. Therefore, the angle from North to BC is 180 + 49, which is 229 degrees.  Or from North clockwise around to the line segment BC.

The angle at point B to West from North is 270 degrees.  The angle from C to B is from North clockwise around, but we measure from B towards C which is the angle we want. The angle from B towards C is 180 + angle ABC from B to North, which is 180 + 49 = 229 degrees.

Therefore the true bearing of point C from point B is 180 + 49 = 229 degrees.
