QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

How much faster is Oliver traveling?

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's find the speeds of Oliver and Justin from the graph.
From the graph, Oliver's distance at time = 1 is approximately 33. Oliver's distance at time = 5 is approximately 175.
Oliver's speed = (175 - 33) / (5 - 1) = 142 / 4 = 35.5
Justin's distance at time = 1 is approximately 25. Justin's distance at time = 5 is approximately 125.
Justin's speed = (125 - 25) / (5 - 1) = 100 / 4 = 25

The difference in speed = Oliver's speed - Justin's speed = 35.5 - 25 = 10.5

Oliver is traveling 10.5 units of distance per unit of time faster than Justin.
