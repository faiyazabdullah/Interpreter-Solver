QUESTION:
Ashlynn models the relationship between the temperature $C$ of a hot cup of tea (in degrees Celsius) and time $T$ since the tea was poured into the cup (in minutes) as $C=20+20 \cdot 0.88^T$. The temperature decreases when time increases, and passes points(0, 40). She wanted to graph the relationship over the first half hour. Here is her work: What mistakes did Ashlynn make when drawing the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Inappropriate scale for $x$-axis
B:Inappropriate scale for $y$-axis
C:Wrong/missing label for $x$-axis
D:Wrong/missing label for $y$-axis
E:Ashlynn didn't make any mistake

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph appears to accurately represent the function $C = 20 + 20(0.88)^T$ over the first half hour (30 minutes). The temperature starts at 40 degrees Celsius when T=0, and decreases as time increases, approaching 20 degrees Celsius. The axes are labeled with 'Time (minutes)' for the x-axis and 'Temperature (degrees Celsius)' for the y-axis. The scales on both axes appear appropriate for the given function and time interval. Therefore, Ashlynn didn't make any mistakes.

Final Answer: E
