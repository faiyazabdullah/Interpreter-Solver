B:60
C:90
D:180

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
In a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. Therefore, AB = BC.
So, we can set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 5x
Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get: 3 = 3x
Dividing both sides by 3, we find: x = 1
Now, let's find the lengths of the sides: AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5 and BC = 5(1) = 5
Since ABCD is a rhombus, its diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. This means that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at a 90-degree angle at point E. Therefore, angle AEB is a right angle.
So, mâˆ AEB = 90 degrees.
