The image shows a square pyramid with a smaller square pyramid on top. The height of the top pyramid is labeled as 2x+3. The length of the side of the top pyramid is labeled as 5. The height of the whole pyramid is labeled as 5x+7. The length of the side of the base of the pyramid is labeled as L.

We are given that the length of the side of the top pyramid is 5. Since the pyramid is a square pyramid, the top is a square. Therefore, the length of all four sides of the top square are 5.

The smaller pyramid sits on top of a frustum. The height of the top pyramid is 2x+3. The height of the whole pyramid is 5x+7. The height of the frustum is then (5x+7) - (2x+3) = 3x+4.

From the properties of similar triangles, the ratio of the side length of the base of the small pyramid to the side length of the base of the large pyramid should be the same as the ratio of the height of the small pyramid to the height of the large pyramid. In other words:

5 / L = (2x+3) / (5x+7)
L = 5(5x+7) / (2x+3)
L = (25x+35) / (2x+3)

Let's re-examine the picture. We are told that the height of the whole pyramid is 5x+7, and the height of the top pyramid is 2x+3.
If the ratio between sides of similar shapes were equal, then the ratio 5/L should be the same as the ratio (2x+3)/(5x+7). Then L = (5 * (5x+7))/(2x+3) or (25x+35)/(2x+3). There is no way to derive a simpler formula for L in terms of x, since we aren't given any specific values.
