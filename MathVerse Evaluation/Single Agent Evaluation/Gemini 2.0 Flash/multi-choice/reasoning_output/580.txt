QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?

No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after t days. Maximilian forgets 15% of what he could recount the day before. This means he remembers 100% - 15% = 85% of what he remembered the day before.
The problem asks: On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?
Let $L_0$ be the initial content Lucy remembers, which is 100%. Let $L_t$ be the percentage of content Lucy remembers after $t$ days.

Let $M_t$ be the percentage of content Maximilian remembers after $t$ days. We know that $M_t = 0.85 \cdot M_{t-1}$ where $M_0 = 100$.

From the graph, we can observe the values for both Lucy and Maximilian. We know after 1 day, Maximilian has forgotten 15% and has retained 85%. We want to find a percentage $x$ such that Lucy retains $(100-x)\%$.
We want to find a percentage that represents how much Lucy forgets each day.
Since we are only given the graphs, we can approximate the value.

After 1 day, Maximilian remembers 85%. From the graph, after 1 day, Lucy's recall percentage is higher than Maximilian's. Let's look further out.
Let's look at the end of the graph. Suppose Maximilian remembers 20%, then Lucy remembers roughly 30%. The gap between the black and gray line becomes smaller with time.

We need more information to give a definitive answer, but based on the prompt, it's most likely that the percentage is a single, fixed value. Let's look back at the beginning of the graph.
After a few days, Lucy's line is noticeably higher than Maximilian's. This means Lucy forgets a smaller percentage of content each day than Maximilian.
Therefore, Lucy forgets less than 15% each day. Let's try to quantify that a bit.

The Lucy's graph is not linear, but for the first few days, the decrease is roughly the same.
If Lucy forgot 10%, her retention rate would be 90%. If Lucy forgot 5%, her retention rate would be 95%.

Based on the limited information, and the fact that the percentage of content Lucy forgets must be less than 15%, we can only give an estimated value. If Lucy forgot 14%, then this seems reasonable compared to Maximillian forgetting 15%.

I cannot make an educated guess for any answer.
