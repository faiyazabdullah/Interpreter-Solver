====================================================================================================
The problem describes a right triangle where the legs are 12 km and 9 km, and the hypotenuse is $h$ km. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse $h$.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, $h^2 = 12^2 + 9^2$.

Calculating the squares:
$12^2 = 144$
$9^2 = 81$

Adding the squares:
$h^2 = 144 + 81 = 225$

Taking the square root of both sides:
$h = \sqrt{225} = 15$

Therefore, the value of $h$ is 15 km.
