QUESTION:
Catalina opened a new restaurant. She modeled the relationship between the number of months $T$ since she opened the restaurant and its profit $P$ (in dollars, measured as income minus expenses) as
$$
P=80(T-4)^2-300 \text {. }
$$ She wanted to create a graph to show the restaurant's profits over the first year. From month=0 to month=2, the profit decreases when months increase. From month=6 to month =13, profit increases when months increase. Here is her work: What mistakes did Catalina make when drawing the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Inappropriate scale for $x$-axis
B:Inappropriate scale for $y$-axis
C:Wrong/missing label for $x$-axis
D:Wrong/missing label for $y$-axis
E:Catalina didn't make any mistake

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The equation for profit is $P=80(T-4)^2-300$.
The vertex of the parabola is at $(4, -300)$. The graph in the image has a vertex around $(4, 0)$.
When $T=0$, $P = 80(0-4)^2 - 300 = 80(16) - 300 = 1280 - 300 = 980$.
When $T=2$, $P = 80(2-4)^2 - 300 = 80(4) - 300 = 320 - 300 = 20$.
When $T=6$, $P = 80(6-4)^2 - 300 = 80(4) - 300 = 320 - 300 = 20$.
When $T=13$, $P = 80(13-4)^2 - 300 = 80(81) - 300 = 6480 - 300 = 6180 - 300 = 6180$.

From month 0 to month 2, the profit decreases when months increase.
From month 6 to month 13, the profit increases when months increase.

The graph should have a minimum at $T=4$ with a profit of $-300$.
The graph in the image has a minimum at $T=4$ with a profit of close to 0.
The y-axis represents the profit (dollars). The values are from 0 to 5500. Since the profit can be negative, the scale should include negative values. The scale should start from at least -300.

The x-axis represents the months. The scale is from 0 to 12, representing the first year. This looks okay.

The wrong/missing label for the y-axis could be an issue. However, the biggest issue is that the y-axis scale is inappropriate.
