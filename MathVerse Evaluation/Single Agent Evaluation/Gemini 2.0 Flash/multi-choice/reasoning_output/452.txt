The line passes through the points (2,-1), (5,1), (8,3), and (11,5). We need to find the equation of the line in point-slope form.

First, let's find the slope (m) of the line using two points, say (2, -1) and (5, 1):
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (1 - (-1)) / (5 - 2) = (1 + 1) / 3 = 2 / 3

Now, we have the slope m = 2/3. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, which is:
y - y1 = m(x - x1)

We can use any of the given points, such as (2, -1):
y - (-1) = (2/3)(x - 2)
y + 1 = (2/3)(x - 2)

The point-slope form is y - y1 = m(x - x1)
Where m = 2/3 and point (x1, y1) is one of the points on the line, (2,-1), (5,1), (8,3), (11,5)

y - (-1) = (2/3) (x - 2)
y + 1 = (2/3) (x - 2)
