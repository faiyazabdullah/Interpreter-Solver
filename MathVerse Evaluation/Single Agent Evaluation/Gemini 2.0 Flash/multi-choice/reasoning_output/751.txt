The problem states that the cylindrical tube has a height of 30 and a circumference of 32. We are asked to find the length of $\overline{A C}$ when the tube is cut along $\overline{A B}$ and laid flat to make a rectangle. In this case, $AB$ will be a side of the rectangle with length 30, and the circumference of the base, 32, will be the other side of the rectangle. The length of $\overline{A C}$ will be the diagonal of the rectangle. Let the length of $\overline{A C}$ be $d$. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have
$$d^2 = 30^2 + 32^2 = 900 + 1024 = 1924$$
$$d = \sqrt{1924} \approx 43.86$$
However, the tube is cut along $AB$ and laid flat to make a rectangle. Then we want to find the distance between point $A$ at one corner of the rectangle and point $C$ at the opposite corner on the other end of the cylinder. $AB$ is the height of the cylinder which is 30. The circumference of the cylinder is 32. We need to find the length of AC. Since the cylinder is laid out flat, we have a rectangle. Let the height be $h = 30$ and the length be $l = 32$. Then by the Pythagorean Theorem, we have
$AC^2 = h^2 + l^2 = 30^2 + 32^2 = 900 + 1024 = 1924$
$AC = \sqrt{1924} \approx 43.86$.
Looking at the answer choices, we see they are far smaller than this.
Since the tube is cut along $AB$, $AB = 30$. The circumference is 32.
$A$ and $C$ are on opposite corners of the rectangle. The length of the rectangle is 30. Half the circumference is $32/2 = 16$. Then we need to find the distance between $A$ and $C$ if we are halfway around the cylinder.
Then $AC^2 = 30^2 + 16^2 = 900 + 256 = 1156$.
Then $AC = \sqrt{1156} = 34$.
