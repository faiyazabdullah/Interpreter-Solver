QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the homothetic figures are composed of a triangle ruler and its center projection under the light. If the ratio of the distance from the bulb to the vertex of the triangle ruler to the distance from the bulb to the corresponding vertex of the triangular ruler projection is 2.0:5.0, and the length of one edge of the triangle ruler is 8.0, Then the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is ()

CHOICES:
A:8cm
B:20cm
C:3.2cm
D:10cm

The homothetic figures are composed of a triangle ruler and its central projection under the light. According to the properties of homothetic figures, the ratio of the corresponding side lengths of homothetic figures is equal to the homothety ratio.
The ratio of the distance from the bulb to the vertex of the triangle ruler to the distance from the bulb to the corresponding vertex of the triangular ruler projection is 2.0:5.0.
So the homothety ratio is 2.0:5.0 = 2:5
Let the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle be x.
Then 8/x = 2/5
So x = 8 * 5 / 2 = 40 / 2 = 20
Therefore, the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is 20.
