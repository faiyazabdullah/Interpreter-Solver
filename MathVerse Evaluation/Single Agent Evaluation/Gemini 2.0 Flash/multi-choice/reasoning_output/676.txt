QUESTION:
The solid shown is constructed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube. Find its surface area if the side length is 14.2 and the radius is half that.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The side length of the cube is 14.2 cm. The radius of the sphere is half the side length, so the radius is 7.1 cm.
The surface area of the cube is 6 * (side length)^2 = 6 * (14.2)^2 = 6 * 201.64 = 1209.84 cm^2.
We are cutting out a quarter of a sphere from the cube. The area of the quarter sphere that is cut out is (1/4) * 4 * pi * r^2 = pi * r^2 = pi * (7.1)^2 = pi * 50.41 = 158.37 cm^2.
However, when we cut out the quarter sphere, we are adding a quarter of the sphere's surface area to the surface area of the solid. The surface area of the sphere is 4 * pi * r^2. A quarter of that is pi * r^2.
So the surface area of the new solid is the surface area of the cube minus the area we cut out plus the area of the curved surface. We need to account for the fact that a square area of side 7.1 cm x 7.1 cm has been removed from each of the two faces of the cube, so the amount to deduct from the surface area is 2 * (7.1 cm)^2 = 2*(50.41) = 100.82 cm^2. But, the newly exposed area is a quarter of a sphere, so that area is 0.25 * (4 * pi * r^2) = pi * r^2 = pi * (7.1 cm)^2 = 50.41 * pi = 158.37 cm^2.

The surface area is 6 * (14.2)^2 - 2*(7.1)^2 + pi*(7.1)^2
= 6 * 201.64 - 2*50.41 + pi * 50.41
= 1209.84 - 100.82 + 50.41 * pi
= 1109.02 + 158.37
= 1267.39 cm^2
