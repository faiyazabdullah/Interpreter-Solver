QUESTION:
In the figure above, P, Q, and R lie on the same line. P is the center of the larger circle, and Q is the center of the smaller circle. If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?

CHOICES:
A.1
B.2
C.4
D.8
E.16

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The radius of the larger circle is given as 4. From the diagram, we can see that the diameter of the smaller circle is equal to the radius of the larger circle. Therefore, if the radius of the larger circle is 4, the diameter of the smaller circle is 4. The radius of the smaller circle is half of its diameter. Hence, the radius of the smaller circle is 4 / 2 = 2.
