QUESTION:
A triangular divider has been placed into a box, as shown in the diagram. The box has sides of length 12cm, 12cm and 17cm. 

Calculate the area of the triangular divider correct to two decimal places.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

Let the triangle be denoted as $\triangle ABC$, where $AB = 17$ cm and $BC = 12$ cm.
We need to find the area of this triangular divider.
The area of the triangle can be calculated using the formula:
Area = $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height$
Here, the base is given as $BC = 12$ cm and the length of the box $AB = 17$ cm.
Since we know the lengths of two sides of the box, we need to use $BC$ as the base.
The height corresponding to this base is the height of the box, which is 12 cm (as given in the question).
The area of the triangle ABC = $\frac{1}{2} \times BC \times$ height
Area $= \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 12$
Area $= 6 \times 12 = 72$ cm$^2$

The area of the triangle is 72 cm$^2$. Since no options are provided to choose from, we cannot select the closest answer.
