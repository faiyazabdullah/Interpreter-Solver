QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, a cylinder with a bottom circumference of 24.0 and a height of 5.0, the shortest route that an ant passes along the surface from point A to point B is ()

CHOICES:
A:12m
B:15m
C:13m
D:14m

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Unfold the cylinder along the line containing A and B. Then the shortest route from A to B is the length of the line segment AB. The height of the cylinder is 5, and the base circumference is 24. The unfolded figure forms a rectangle with sides 5 and 24. Since point B is at the midpoint of the bottom circumference, the horizontal distance is 24/2 = 12. Therefore, the shortest distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with sides 5 and 12.
Using the Pythagorean theorem:
shortest distance = $\sqrt{5^2 + 12^2} = \sqrt{25 + 144} = \sqrt{169} = 13$.
