QUESTION:
After filling some oil in a cylindrical oil tank with a diameter of 200.0, the cross section is shown in the figure. If the width of the oil surface AB = 160.0, the maximum depth of oil is ()

CHOICES:
A:40cm
B:60cm
C:80cm
D:100cm

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The diameter of the cylindrical oil tank is 200 cm, so the radius is 100 cm.
The width of the oil surface AB is 160 cm.
Let O be the center of the circle.
Let M be the midpoint of AB. Then AM = MB = 160/2 = 80 cm.
OM is perpendicular to AB.
In right triangle OMA, we have OA = 100 cm and AM = 80 cm.
By the Pythagorean theorem, OM^2 + AM^2 = OA^2, so OM^2 = OA^2 - AM^2 = 100^2 - 80^2 = 10000 - 6400 = 3600.
Thus, OM = sqrt(3600) = 60 cm.
Since OM is the distance from the center O to the oil surface AB, the maximum depth of the oil is the radius minus OM, which is 100 - 60 = 40 cm.
However, the depth could also be the radius plus OM. In this case, the depth is 100 + 60 = 160 cm. Since we are looking for the *maximum* depth of oil *as shown in the image*, we should subtract the distance to the chord from the radius. The oil is below AB, so the maximum depth of the oil is OA - OM = 100 - 60 = 40 cm.
