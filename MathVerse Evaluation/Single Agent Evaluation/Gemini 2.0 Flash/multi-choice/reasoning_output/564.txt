QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function going through (0,7), (-4,7) with a vertex (-2,3). f(x)=4(x-5)^2+2. Which function has a greater minimum?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ has a greater minimum than $g$.
B:$g$ has a greater minimum than $f$.
C:$f$ and $g$ share the same minimum.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The minimum of g(x) is at the vertex, which is (-2,3). Thus, the minimum value of g(x) is 3.
The function f(x) is given as f(x)=4(x-5)^2+2. This is a quadratic function in vertex form, which is a(x-h)^2+k, where (h,k) is the vertex. In this case, the vertex is (5,2), so the minimum value of f(x) is 2.
Since the minimum of g(x) is 3 and the minimum of f(x) is 2, g(x) has a greater minimum than f(x).
