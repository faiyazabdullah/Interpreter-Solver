QUESTION:
The graph, which is a piecewise function and passes through the origin, shows Frank's speed while he is competing in a walking race, the x-axis representing Time and the y-axis representing Speed. Which situation corresponds to the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Frank starts off at a constant speed and then increases his speed at a steady rate
B:Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed
C:Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually, then increases his pace at a faster rate as he sees his arch rival beside him and finally increases his pace at a more gradual pace
D:Frank increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows Frank's speed over time. The first segment of the graph is a straight line with a positive slope, indicating that Frank's speed is increasing at a constant rate. The second segment has a decreasing positive slope which means he is increasing his pace at a slower rate. Finally, the last segment is a horizontal line, indicating that Frank is maintaining a constant speed. Therefore, Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed.

Final Answer: B
