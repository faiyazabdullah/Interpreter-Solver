QUESTION:
There are five lines shown. Three lines are parallel and the other two lines intersect with them. The spacing of the parallel lines is equal. Find x.

CHOICES:
A:0.5
B:1
C:1.5
D:2

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

From the figure, we know that the three horizontal lines are parallel, and the two lines that intersect with them are transversals. Since the spacing between the parallel lines is equal, we have that the lengths between where the transversal lines meet the parallel lines are equal.
Therefore, we can write the equation $2x+3 = 6-x$. Adding $x$ to both sides yields $3x+3 = 6$. Subtracting $3$ from both sides gives $3x=3$, so $x=1$.
From the figure, we also have $\frac{4}{3}y+1 = 2y$. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives $4y+3=6y$. Subtracting $4y$ from both sides gives $3=2y$, so $y=\frac{3}{2}=1.5$.
The question asks us to find x. We found that $x=1$.
Comparing with the given answer choices, we have $x=1$.
