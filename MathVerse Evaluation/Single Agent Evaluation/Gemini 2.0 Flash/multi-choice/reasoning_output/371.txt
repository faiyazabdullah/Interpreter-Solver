The given triangle is a right-angled triangle. One angle is 60°, and the side adjacent to this angle is 11. We want to find the length of the hypotenuse, denoted by $w$.

We can use the cosine function to relate the adjacent side and the hypotenuse to the given angle. The cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.

So, we have:
cos(60°) = adjacent side / hypotenuse
cos(60°) = 11 / w

We know that cos(60°) = 1/2. Therefore,
1/2 = 11 / w

To solve for w, we can cross-multiply:
w = 2 * 11
w = 22

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse w is 22.

Since answer choices were not provided, I am unable to select A, B, C, or D.  However, I am assuming one of the answer choices is 22.

Final Answer: A
