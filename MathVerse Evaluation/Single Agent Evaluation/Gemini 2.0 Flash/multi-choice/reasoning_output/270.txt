The image shows several triangles joined together. We are given the angles: 25, 51, 35, and 28 degrees. Also, there are two right angles shown. We want to find angle 6.

Let's look at the triangle containing angle 6. One of the angles is a right angle, so it measures 90 degrees. Let the third angle in this triangle be x. Then, the sum of the angles in this triangle must be 180 degrees. Thus, x + angle 6 + 90 = 180. So angle 6 = 180 - 90 - x = 90 - x.

We are given that angle 5 = x. Consider the triangle containing the 35 and 28-degree angles. The third angle in that triangle is supplementary to angle 5. Thus, 35 + 28 + (180 - angle 5) = 180.
Then 35 + 28 + 180 - angle 5 = 180, so 63 - angle 5 = 0. Therefore angle 5 = 63 degrees.
Since x = angle 5 = 63, then angle 6 = 90 - x = 90 - 63 = 27 degrees.

Since 27 is not an option, let's try to find another angle that is close to 27.
Let's consider the leftmost large triangle. The three angles are 25 degrees, 51+angle 2, and angle 3. The sum of these angles is 180.
The angles 1 and 2 add up to 90 degrees.
Looking at the answer choices, we have 25, 28, 35, 55.
Angle 6 = 90 - angle 5 = 90 - (35+28) = 90-63 = 27.
The closest answer to 27 is 28.
