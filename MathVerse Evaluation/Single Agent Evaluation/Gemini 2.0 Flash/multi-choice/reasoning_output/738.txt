The composite figure consists of a cone and a semi-sphere.
The radius of the cone is given as 3 cm and the height of the cone is given as 12 cm.
The radius of the semi-sphere is the same as the radius of the cone, which is 3 cm.

The volume of the cone is given by the formula:
V_cone = (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h
where r is the radius and h is the height.
V_cone = (1/3) * pi * (3^2) * 12
V_cone = (1/3) * pi * 9 * 12
V_cone = pi * 3 * 12
V_cone = 36 * pi cubic cm

The volume of a sphere is given by the formula:
V_sphere = (4/3) * pi * r^3
Since we have a semi-sphere, the volume of the semi-sphere is half the volume of the sphere.
V_semi-sphere = (1/2) * (4/3) * pi * r^3
V_semi-sphere = (2/3) * pi * (3^3)
V_semi-sphere = (2/3) * pi * 27
V_semi-sphere = 2 * pi * 9
V_semi-sphere = 18 * pi cubic cm

The total volume of the composite figure is the sum of the volume of the cone and the volume of the semi-sphere.
V_total = V_cone + V_semi-sphere
V_total = 36 * pi + 18 * pi
V_total = 54 * pi cubic cm
Using the value of pi as approximately 3.14159,
V_total = 54 * 3.14159
V_total = 169.64586
Rounding to two decimal places, we get 169.65 cubic cm.
