QUESTION:
Mio bought a tablet and pays monthly for internet service for it. She graphed the relationship between the number of months she has had the tablet and the total amount she has spent on it. x-axis labels "Time (months)", and y-axis labels "Total cost (dollars)"
What does the y-intercept represent in this context?
Choose 1 answer:

CHOICES:
A:The number of months after which the total cost is 0 dollars.
B:The cost of buying the tablet
C:The cost per month of internet service
D:None of the above

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The y-intercept is the value of y when x is 0. In this context, x is the number of months and y is the total cost. So the y-intercept represents the total cost when the number of months is 0, which is the cost of buying the tablet before any internet service has been paid for.

Final Answer: B
