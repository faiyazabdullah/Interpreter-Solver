GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The figure is a quarter circle with a square cut out. The radius of the quarter circle is 11m.
The area of the quarter circle is $\frac{1}{4} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi (11)^2 = \frac{121 \pi}{4}$.
Since the square has sides of length equal to the radius, the area of the square is $11^2 = 121$.
So the area of the shape is the area of the quarter circle minus the area of the square.
This is equal to $\frac{121 \pi}{4} - 121 = 121 (\frac{\pi}{4} - 1) = \frac{121}{4} (\pi - 4)$.

The area of the shape is $\frac{121\pi}{4} - 121 \mathrm{~m}^2$ which is equal to
$121(\frac{\pi}{4} - 1) \approx 121 (0.7854 - 1) = 121 (-0.2146) = -25.9666$, which is incorrect since area cannot be negative.
The square is cut out of the sector.
Area of sector $= \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2$
Area of square $= 11 \times 11 = 121$.
Therefore, the total area of the figure is the area of the sector less the area of the square
Area $= \frac{1}{4} \times \pi \times 11^2 - 11^2$.
Area $= \frac{121}{4} \pi - 121 = \frac{121 \pi - 4 \times 121}{4}$.
Area $= \frac{121 (\pi - 4)}{4} = \frac{121 \pi}{4} - 121$.
