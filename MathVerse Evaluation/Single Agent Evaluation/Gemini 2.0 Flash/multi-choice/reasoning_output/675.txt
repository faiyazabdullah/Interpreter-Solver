QUESTION:
Let us find the surface area of the solid given (constructed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder). The radius is 15 cm. The height of cylinder is 22 cm.

Hence, find the total surface area of the shape.

Give our answer to two decimal places.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The solid is constructed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder.
The radius of the cylinder and hemisphere is given as $r = 15$ cm.
The height of the cylinder is given as $h = 22$ cm.
The surface area of the cylinder is $2\pi r h + \pi r^2$.  (Note we do not include the top since the hemisphere is removed from the top.)
The surface area of the hemisphere is $2 \pi r^2$.

The total surface area is the curved surface area of the cylinder plus the base of the cylinder plus the surface area of the hemisphere.
Thus, the total surface area is $2\pi r h + \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r^2 = 2\pi r h + 3 \pi r^2$.

Substituting the values of $r$ and $h$, we get
$2 \pi (15)(22) + 3 \pi (15)^2 = 660\pi + 3(225)\pi = 660\pi + 675\pi = 1335\pi$
$1335\pi \approx 1335 \times 3.14159265 = 4194.525614$
The total surface area of the shape is approximately 4194.53 square cm.
