QUESTION:
In the right triangle, the hypotenuse is 20 and two sides are y and x. Find y.

CHOICES:
A:4
B:6
C:8
D:10

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given triangle is a right triangle. The hypotenuse is 20, and one of the angles is 60 degrees. The side opposite to the 60-degree angle is x, and the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle is y.
We are asked to find the value of y.
We can use trigonometric ratios to solve for y.
Since y is adjacent to the 60-degree angle and 20 is the hypotenuse, we can use the cosine function:
cos(60) = adjacent / hypotenuse
cos(60) = y / 20
We know that cos(60) = 1/2.
So, 1/2 = y / 20
Multiply both sides by 20:
20 * (1/2) = y
10 = y
Therefore, y = 10.

Comparing this result with the given answer choices:
A: 4
B: 6
C: 8
D: 10
The value of y is 10, which matches answer choice D.

Final Answer: D
