GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The airplane is flying $35^\circ$ south of east. The control tower orders the plane to turn $7^\circ$ to the left.
Since the plane is flying south of east, turning to the left means turning more towards the south.
Therefore, the new course will be $35^\circ + 7^\circ = 42^\circ$ south of east.
The new course is $42^\circ$ south of east.

Final Answer: A
