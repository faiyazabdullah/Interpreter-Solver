QUESTION:
A system of two equations: $x^2+y^2=9$ and $y=x^2-4$ and their graphs in the 
xy-plane are shown above. How many solutions 
does the system have?

CHOICES:
A:One
B:Two
C:Three
D:Four

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The equation $x^2+y^2=9$ represents a circle centered at the origin with radius 3. The equation $y=x^2-4$ represents a parabola with vertex at $(0,-4)$. From the graph, we can see that the parabola intersects the circle at four distinct points. Therefore, the system of equations has four solutions.

Final Answer: D
