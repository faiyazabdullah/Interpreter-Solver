The question asks for the number of solutions to the equation $x^3 - x^2 - x = -2$.
We are given the graph of $y = x^3 - x^2 - x$. To find the number of solutions to $x^3 - x^2 - x = -2$, we need to find the number of times the graph of $y = x^3 - x^2 - x$ intersects the horizontal line $y = -2$.
Looking at the given graph, we can imagine a horizontal line $y = -2$. The graph of $y = x^3 - x^2 - x$ goes down to approximately $y = -1$ at the point (1, -1). As $x$ goes more negative, the graph of $y = x^3 - x^2 - x$ goes to $-\infty$. So, the graph of $y = x^3 - x^2 - x$ will intersect the line $y = -2$ exactly once.
Therefore, the equation $x^3 - x^2 - x = -2$ has one solution.
