GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The diagram shows the angle PMS is 50 degrees.
We need to find the true bearing of P from M. True bearing is measured clockwise from North.
The angle between the north direction MS and the line MP is given as 50 degrees.
The angle from the north to the line MP, measured clockwise is 180 + 50 = 230 degrees.
The true bearing of P from M is 230 degrees.
