====================================================================================================
The image shows a rectangle divided into two sections. The area of the left section is 6000. The total area of the rectangle is 6096. The area of the right section, which is the remaining area, is the difference between the total area and the area of the left section.

Remaining area = Total area - Area of the left section
Remaining area = 6096 - 6000
Remaining area = 96
