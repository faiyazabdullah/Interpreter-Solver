The triangle is a right triangle with one angle being 45 degrees. Therefore, the other angle is also 45 degrees, meaning that the triangle is an isosceles right triangle. In an isosceles right triangle, the two legs are equal in length. Thus, $y = 4\sqrt{3}$.

We want to find the value of $x$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem:
$x^2 = (4\sqrt{3})^2 + y^2$
Since $y = 4\sqrt{3}$, we have
$x^2 = (4\sqrt{3})^2 + (4\sqrt{3})^2$
$x^2 = 16(3) + 16(3) = 48 + 48 = 96$
$x = \sqrt{96} = \sqrt{16 \cdot 6} = 4\sqrt{6}$

The length of $x$ is $4\sqrt{6}$.
