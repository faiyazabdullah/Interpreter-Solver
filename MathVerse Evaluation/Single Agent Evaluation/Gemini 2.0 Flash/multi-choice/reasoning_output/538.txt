GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows a trigonometric function.
We are given two points where the function intersects its midline: $\left(\frac{3}{5} \pi, 8\right)$ and $\left(\frac{7}{5} \pi, 8\right)$.
Since these are consecutive intersections with the midline, the horizontal distance between these points is half the period.
The horizontal distance between the two points is $\frac{7}{5} \pi - \frac{3}{5} \pi = \frac{4}{5} \pi$.
Since this distance is half the period, the full period is $2 \cdot \frac{4}{5} \pi = \frac{8}{5} \pi$.

The question asks for the period of the function.
The period is the distance it takes for the function to complete one full cycle.
The distance between the two intersections is half the period.
The distance is $\frac{7\pi}{5} - \frac{3\pi}{5} = \frac{4\pi}{5}$.
The period is twice this distance, so the period is $2 \cdot \frac{4\pi}{5} = \frac{8\pi}{5}$.
