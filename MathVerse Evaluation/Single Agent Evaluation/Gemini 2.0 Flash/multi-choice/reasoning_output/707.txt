The figure is a prism with a trapezoidal base. The parallel sides of the trapezoid are 9 cm and 12 cm, and the height of the trapezoid is 5 cm. The length of the prism is 3 cm.
The surface area of the prism is the sum of the areas of the two trapezoids and the four rectangles.

Area of one trapezoid = $\frac{1}{2}(9+12) \times 5 = \frac{1}{2} \times 21 \times 5 = \frac{105}{2} = 52.5$ cm$^2$
So, the area of two trapezoids = $2 \times 52.5 = 105$ cm$^2$

The sides of the trapezoid are 9 cm, 12 cm, 5 cm, and ? cm.
Let's find the missing side length. Drop perpendiculars from the top vertices of the trapezoid to the bottom side. This creates a rectangle and two triangles. The base of each triangle is $\frac{12-9}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$ cm.
The height is 5 cm.
Let the other side be x. Then, $x^2 = 5^2 + 1.5^2 = 25 + 2.25 = 27.25$
$x = \sqrt{27.25} \approx 5.22$ cm

The rectangles are:
$9 \times 3 = 27$ cm$^2$
$12 \times 3 = 36$ cm$^2$
$5 \times 3 = 15$ cm$^2$
$5.22 \times 3 = 15.66$ cm$^2$

The sum of the areas of the four rectangles = $27 + 36 + 15 + 15.66 = 93.66$ cm$^2$

The total surface area = $105 + 93.66 = 198.66$ cm$^2$
Round to two decimal places: 198.66 cm$^2$

The trapezoid base has edges of 9 cm, 12 cm, 5cm and 5.22 cm. The length is 3 cm.
Area of the trapezoids = 2 * (1/2 * (9+12) * 5) = 105 cm^2
Rectangles:
9 cm * 3 cm = 27 cm^2
12 cm * 3 cm = 36 cm^2
5 cm * 3 cm = 15 cm^2
5.22 cm * 3 cm = 15.66 cm^2
Total area = 105 + 27 + 36 + 15 + 15.66 = 198.66 cm^2
