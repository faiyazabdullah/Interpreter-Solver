QUESTION:
The production process of paper umbrellas in our country is very ingenious. As shown in the figure, whether the umbrella is opened or closed, the handle AP always bisects the angle angle BAC formed by the two ribs in the same plane, and AE = AF, DE = DF, so as to ensure that the umbrella ring can slide along the handle. When a toy umbrella is opened, the BDC is on the same straight line. If AB = 50.0, AD = 14.0, then the area of ​​oil paper required to make such a paper umbrella is (don't remember the seam) ()

CHOICES:
A:48cm^{2}
B:70πcm^{2}
C:2400πcm^{2}
D:2500πcm^{2}

The question seems to be asking for the area of the oil paper required to make the umbrella, but it does not mention that the shape of the umbrella is a sector or anything related to a circle, it also does not give the angle of the sector. So the question cannot be answered with the given information.
However, it seems to ask for the area of the circular ring made by AB and AD (or more generally AE and AD). Assuming the oil paper is shaped like the big sector minus the small sector, the total is then π * (AB^2 - AD^2) = π * (50^2 - 14^2) = π * (2500 - 196) = 2304π. Since this is not in the provided choices, we must assume that what is asked has to do with a surface area proportional to the length of AB and AD. In the context that they want to make an umbrella, there is nothing that can be said with the information. There is possibly a missing proportion information, and the area should scale linearly as if it asked for the relative ratio. I am going to make an educated guess based on the information available by assuming it wants an answer near 2500π. So the closest answer is 2400π.
