QUESTION:
Consider the graph, where it is an exponential function and passes through (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), and (3,8), shown.

Which of the following relationships could be represented by the given graph?

CHOICES:
A:The number of people $(y)$ attending a parent/teacher conference when there are $x$ parents, each bringing 2 children.
B:The number of layers $(y)$ resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half $x$ times.
C:The number of handshakes $(y)$ made by $x$ people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The graph represents the exponential function $y = 2^x$. Let's analyze each answer choice to see which one matches this relationship.

A: The number of people $(y)$ attending a parent/teacher conference when there are $x$ parents, each bringing 2 children.
If there are $x$ parents and each parent brings 2 children, the total number of people attending is $y = x + 2x = 3x$. This is a linear relationship, not exponential.

B: The number of layers $(y)$ resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half $x$ times.
When a paper is folded in half once, there are 2 layers. When it is folded twice, there are 4 layers. When it is folded three times, there are 8 layers.  The number of layers can be expressed as $y = 2^x$, which matches the graph.

C: The number of handshakes $(y)$ made by $x$ people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.
If there are $x$ people, the number of handshakes is given by the combination formula: $y = \binom{x}{2} = \frac{x(x-1)}{2}$. This is a quadratic relationship, not exponential.

Comparing the graph $y=2^x$ with the answer choices, we see that option B, $y=2^x$, accurately represents the exponential relationship.

Final Answer: B
