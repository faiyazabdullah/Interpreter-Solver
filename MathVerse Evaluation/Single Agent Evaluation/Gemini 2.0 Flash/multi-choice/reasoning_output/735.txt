GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let $s$ be the length of the seven marked edges. From the figure, we are given that the height of the solid is $7$ cm and the length of the solid is $16$ cm. Since the seven marked edges have the same length, we have $s = 7$ cm.
The composite solid can be seen as the union of three rectangular prisms. The base prism has height 7 cm, width equal to $s$, and length 16 cm. The two prisms on top have height $s = 7$ cm, width $s = 7$ cm, and length $\frac{16 - s}{2} = \frac{16-7}{2} = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5$ cm.
The volume of the bottom prism is $7 \times 7 \times 16 = 49 \times 16 = 784$ cubic centimeters.
The volume of the two top prisms is $2 \times (7 \times 7 \times 4.5) = 2 \times (49 \times 4.5) = 2 \times 220.5 = 441$ cubic centimeters.
The total volume of the composite solid is the sum of the volumes of the three prisms: $784 + 441 = 1225$ cubic centimeters.
