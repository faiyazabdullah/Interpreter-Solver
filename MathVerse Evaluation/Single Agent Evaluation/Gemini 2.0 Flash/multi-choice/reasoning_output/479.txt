QUESTION:
There is a curve that goes through (-3,0), (-2,1), and (-1,2). Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A:This is a one-to-one function
B:This is not a one-to-one function

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The question asks to determine if the given relation is a one-to-one function. A one-to-one function is a function where each element of the range is associated with only one element of the domain. Graphically, this can be determined by using the horizontal line test. If any horizontal line intersects the graph at more than one point, the function is not one-to-one.

In the given graph, a horizontal line can be drawn that intersects the graph at more than one point. For example, the horizontal line y = 2 intersects the graph at approximately x = -1 and x = 1. Another example, the horizontal line y = 0 intersects the graph at about x = -4 and x = -3. Thus, this is not a one-to-one function.

Final Answer: B
