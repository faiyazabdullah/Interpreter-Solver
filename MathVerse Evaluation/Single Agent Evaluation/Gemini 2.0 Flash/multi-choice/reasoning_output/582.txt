A:Yes
B:No

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given graph is a rational function with a vertical asymptote at x=4 and a horizontal asymptote at y=0 (x-axis). To determine if the function has an inverse, we need to check if it is a one-to-one function. A one-to-one function passes the horizontal line test, which means that any horizontal line drawn on the graph intersects the function at most once. Looking at the graph, it appears that any horizontal line will intersect the graph at most once. Therefore, the function is one-to-one.

Since the function is one-to-one, it has an inverse function.
