GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let AB = x and BD = y. Then the area of rectangle ABDF is xy. Since C is the midpoint of BD, BC = CD = y/2. Since E is the midpoint of DF, DE = EF = x/2. The area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * AB * BC = (1/2) * x * (y/2) = xy/4. The area of triangle CDE is (1/2) * CD * DE = (1/2) * (y/2) * (x/2) = xy/8. The area of rectangle ABDF is xy. The area of the unshaded region is the sum of the areas of triangles ABC and CDE, which is xy/4 + xy/8 = 3xy/8. The area of the shaded region is the area of rectangle ABDF minus the area of the unshaded region, which is xy - 3xy/8 = 5xy/8. Therefore, the fraction of the area of the rectangle that is shaded is (5xy/8) / xy = 5/8.
