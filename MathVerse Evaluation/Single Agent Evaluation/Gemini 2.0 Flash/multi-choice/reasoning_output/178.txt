According to the inscribed angle theorem, in a circle, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, the central angle that subtends the same arc as angle ACB is twice the measure of angle ACB. Let O be the center of the circle. Then angle AOB = 2 * angle ACB = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. Also OA = OB = R, where R is the radius of the circle.
In triangle AOB, OA = OB, so it is an isosceles triangle. Since angle AOB = 60 degrees, the other two angles are equal and their sum is 180 - 60 = 120 degrees. Thus angle OAB = angle OBA = 120/2 = 60 degrees. Therefore, triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle, which means OA = OB = AB.
Since AB = 6, then the radius of the circle R = OA = AB = 6.
