The length of BC is l, and the length of DC is w. The area of the shaded region is \pi*l*w/4. The area of the shaded region is 7*\pi.
We want to find the area of the unshaded region.
The area of the rectangle ABCD is l*w.
We are given that \pi*l*w/4 = 7*\pi.
Multiplying both sides by 4/\pi, we get l*w = 28.
The area of the rectangle is l*w = 28.
The area of the shaded region is 7*\pi \approx 7*3.14 = 21.98.
The area of the unshaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the shaded region.
Area of unshaded region = l*w - \pi*l*w/4 = 28 - 7*\pi.
Using \pi \approx 3.14, the area of the unshaded region is approximately 28 - 7*3.14 = 28 - 21.98 = 6.02.
The closest whole number to 6.02 is 6.
