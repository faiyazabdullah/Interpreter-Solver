In the rectangle ABCD, AC = 3 and BC = 5. We need to find the angle of depression from point B to point C, which is angle x.

In right triangle ABC, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AB.
AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2
AB^2 + 3^2 = 5^2
AB^2 + 9 = 25
AB^2 = 16
AB = 4

Since ABCD is a rectangle, angle BAC is 90 degrees. The angle of depression x is equal to angle ACB. We can use trigonometric ratios to find angle ACB.
tan(ACB) = AB / AC
tan(ACB) = 4 / 3
ACB = arctan(4/3)
ACB ≈ 53.13 degrees

Since x = ACB,
x ≈ 53.13 degrees

Final Answer: A
