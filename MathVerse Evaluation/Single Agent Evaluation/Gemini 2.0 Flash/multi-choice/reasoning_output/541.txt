====================================================================================================
The graph has a minimum point at $(1, 1.5)$ and an amplitude of $1.5$. The amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values. Let $M$ be the maximum value and $m$ be the minimum value. The midline is the average of the maximum and minimum values, which is $\frac{M+m}{2}$. Also, the amplitude is $\frac{M-m}{2}$.
We are given that the minimum value $m = 1.5$ and the amplitude is $1.5$.
So, $\frac{M-m}{2} = 1.5$.
$M-m = 2(1.5) = 3$.
Since $m = 1.5$, we have $M - 1.5 = 3$.
Therefore, $M = 3 + 1.5 = 4.5$.
The midline is $\frac{M+m}{2} = \frac{4.5+1.5}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$.
The equation of the midline is $y = 3$.
