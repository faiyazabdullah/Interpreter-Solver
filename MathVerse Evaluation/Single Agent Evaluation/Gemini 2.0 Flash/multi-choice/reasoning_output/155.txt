QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the student Xiao Li whose height is 1.6 wants to measure the height of the school's flagpole. When he stands at C, the shadow of the top of his head coincides with the shadow of the top of the flagpole, and AC = 2.0, BC = 8.0, then the height of the flagpole is ()

CHOICES:
A:6.4米
B:7米
C:8米
D:9米

Let the height of the person be $h_p$ and the height of the flagpole be $h_f$. Let the distance from the person to point A be $AC$ and the distance from the base of the flagpole to point A be $AB$. We are given $h_p = 1.6$, $AC = 2$, and $BC = 8$. Therefore, $AB = AC + BC = 2 + 8 = 10$.

Since the student's shadow coincides with the shadow of the top of the flagpole, we have similar triangles. Let the triangle formed by the person and their shadow be $\triangle ACE$, where $E$ is the top of the person's head. Let the triangle formed by the flagpole and its shadow be $\triangle ABF$, where $F$ is the top of the flagpole.
Then, $\triangle ACE \sim \triangle ABF$.

We can set up a proportion:
$\frac{h_p}{AC} = \frac{h_f}{AB}$
$\frac{1.6}{2} = \frac{h_f}{10}$

$h_f = \frac{1.6}{2} \times 10$
$h_f = 0.8 \times 10$
$h_f = 8$

Therefore, the height of the flagpole is 8 meters.

Final Answer: C
