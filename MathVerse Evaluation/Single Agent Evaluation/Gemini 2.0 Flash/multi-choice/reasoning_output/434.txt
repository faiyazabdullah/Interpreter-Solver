QUESTION:
Given the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at 9 and -9 and with y-axis at 3 and -3, determine its equation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given ellipse has intercepts at (9,0), (-9,0), (0,3), and (0,-3). This indicates that the center of the ellipse is at the origin (0,0).
The semi-major axis (a) is along the x-axis and has a length of 9.
The semi-minor axis (b) is along the y-axis and has a length of 3.

The standard equation of an ellipse centered at the origin is:
(x^2 / a^2) + (y^2 / b^2) = 1

In this case, a = 9 and b = 3. Plugging these values into the equation gives:
(x^2 / 9^2) + (y^2 / 3^2) = 1
(x^2 / 81) + (y^2 / 9) = 1

The equation of the ellipse is (x^2 / 81) + (y^2 / 9) = 1.
The question asks for the equation, and we have found it. There are no choices.

Final Answer: A
