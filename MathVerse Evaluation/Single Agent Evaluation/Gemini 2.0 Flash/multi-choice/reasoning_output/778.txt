Since AC is the diameter of the circle, the center of the circle is the midpoint of AC, which is given as O.
Therefore, AO = OC, and AO is the radius of the circle.
We are given that AB = AO.
Therefore, AB = AO = OC.
Since AO = BO, triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle.
Let the measure of angle ABO be x degrees.
Then the measure of angle BAO is also x degrees.
Since AC is the diameter, angle ABC is a right angle, so angle ABC = 90 degrees.
Also, BO = OC, so triangle BOC is an isosceles triangle.
The measure of angle BOC is 180 - 2x (since triangle ABO is isosceles, so angle AOB = 180-2x).
Since AO = BO = OC, we have AO = OC = BO.
Thus, triangle ABO and triangle BOC are isosceles triangles.
In triangle ABO, AB = AO, so angle ABO = angle AOB.
Let angle ABO = x.
Then angle BAO = x.
In triangle BOC, BO = OC, so angle OBC = angle OCB.
Angle AOB = 180 - 2x.
Angle BOC = 180 - angle AOB = 180 - (180 - 2x) = 2x.
Since triangle BOC is isosceles, angle OBC = angle OCB.
The sum of angles in triangle BOC is 180 degrees.
Therefore, angle OBC + angle OCB + angle BOC = 180.
angle OBC + angle OBC + 2x = 180.
2 * angle OBC = 180 - 2x.
angle OBC = 90 - x.
Angle ABC = angle ABO + angle OBC = 90.
Therefore, x + (90 - x) = 90.
From AB=AO, triangle ABO is an isosceles triangle, so angle ABO = angle BAO. Let angle ABO = x. Then angle BAO = x.
Since angle ABC = 90, then angle ABO + angle OBC = 90.
Since BO=OC, triangle BOC is an isosceles triangle, so angle OBC = angle OCB.
In triangle ABC, angle BAC + angle ACB + angle ABC = 180.
Angle BAC = x, angle ABC = 90, so x + angle ACB + 90 = 180.
Then angle ACB = 90 - x.
So angle OBC = angle OCB = 90 - x.
In triangle BOC, angle BOC + angle OBC + angle OCB = 180.
Angle BOC + (90 - x) + (90 - x) = 180.
Angle BOC + 180 - 2x = 180.
Angle BOC = 2x.
In triangle ABO, angle ABO + angle BAO + angle AOB = 180.
x + x + angle AOB = 180.
2x + angle AOB = 180.
Angle AOB = 180 - 2x.
Angles AOB and BOC are supplementary, so angle AOB + angle BOC = 180.
Then 180 - 2x + 2x = 180.
Since AO=BO, triangle ABO is isosceles, angle BAO= angle ABO = x
In triangle ABC, AC is the diameter, so angle ABC=90
Angle OBA = x
Angle OBC = 90 - x
Since BO = OC, triangle BOC is isosceles, so Angle OBC = OCB = 90 - x
Triangle BOC -> angle BOC = 180 - 2(90 - x) = 2x
Triangle ABO -> angle AOB = 180 - 2x
So Angle AOC = angle AOB + BOC = 180 - 2x + 2x = 180, which works.

If AB=AO, we need to find x
Consider triangle ABO, angle BAO = angle ABO = x
Since AC is a diameter, then angle ABC = 90
In triangle ABC,
BAC+ABC+ACB = 180
x+90+ACB = 180
ACB = 90 -x
Since BO = OC, Triangle BOC is isosceles
BOC = 180-2(90-x) = 2x
AOB = 180 - BOC = 180 -2x
In AOB 2x+ 180 -2x = 180

The problem must have x + 90 - x != 0 so that must be a mistake
OBA+OBC = 90
So consider angle AOB is supplementarty with ACB

Let x = 30
BOC = 60
So triangle BOC is equilateral
