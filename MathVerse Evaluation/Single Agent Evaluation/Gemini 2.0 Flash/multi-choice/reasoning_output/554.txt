QUESTION:
A polynomial $p$ is graphed, which goes through (-2.5,0), (-1,0), (3,0). What could be the equation of $p$ ?

CHOICES:
A:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)^2(x-3)^2$
B:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)(x-3)^2$
C:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)(x-3)$
D:$p(x)=(x+1)(2 x+5)(x-3)^2$

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The polynomial $p$ has roots at $x = -2.5$, $x = -1$, and $x = 3$. Since the graph touches the x-axis at $x = -1$ and $x = 3$, these are roots of multiplicity 2. The root at $x = -2.5$ has multiplicity 1. We can rewrite $x = -2.5$ as $x = -\frac{5}{2}$, so $2x = -5$, and $2x + 5 = 0$. Thus, the polynomial has factors $(x+1)^2$, $(x-3)^2$, and $(2x+5)$. So a possible equation for $p(x)$ is $p(x) = (x+1)^2(2x+5)(x-3)^2$.

Comparing this to the answer choices:
A: $p(x) = (x+1)^2 (2x+5)^2 (x-3)^2$. This would mean the graph touches the x-axis at -2.5, but the graph passes through the x-axis at -2.5.
B: $p(x) = (x+1)^2 (2x+5) (x-3)^2$. This is exactly what we found.
C: $p(x) = (x+1)^2 (2x+5) (x-3)$. This would mean the graph passes through the x-axis at 3, but the graph touches the x-axis at 3.
D: $p(x) = (x+1) (2x+5) (x-3)^2$. This would mean the graph passes through the x-axis at -1, but the graph touches the x-axis at -1.

Therefore, the correct equation for $p(x)$ is $(x+1)^2(2x+5)(x-3)^2$.
