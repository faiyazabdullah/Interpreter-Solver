QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, point P is a point on the extended line AB of the diameter of circle O, passing point P to draw the tangent PC of circle O, and the tangent point is C. If AO = OB = PB = 1.0, then the length of PC is ()

CHOICES:
A:1
B:√{3}
C:2
D:√{5}

Since PC is tangent to the circle O at point C, then OC is perpendicular to PC. Therefore, triangle OCP is a right triangle with OC as one leg, PC as the other leg, and OP as the hypotenuse.

Given AO = OB = PB = 1, then OC = OB = 1 (radius of the circle). Also, OP = OB + BP = 1 + 1 = 2.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle OCP, we have:
OC^2 + PC^2 = OP^2
1^2 + PC^2 = 2^2
1 + PC^2 = 4
PC^2 = 4 - 1
PC^2 = 3
PC = √3

Comparing our calculated result with the given answer choices, we find that it matches choice B.

Final Answer: B
