The problem states that Peter received a lump sum payment of $\$50000$ and every month he withdraws $5\%$ of the remaining funds. We need to find the amount of the first withdrawal.
The first withdrawal will be $5\%$ of the initial amount, which is $\$50000$.
So, the first withdrawal amount is $0.05 \times 50000 = 2500$.
The first withdrawal is $\$2500$.

Final Answer: A
