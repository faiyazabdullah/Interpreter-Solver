QUESTION:
In triangle ABD, BC is the perpendicular to AD, with AB length of 58 and BD length of 72. Angle A is 57°, angle D is 31°. Consider the following diagram. Hence, find AD correct to two decimal places.

In triangle ABC, we have:
sin(A) = BC/AB
BC = AB * sin(A) = 58 * sin(57°) = 58 * 0.8387 = 48.6446

In triangle BCD, we have:
sin(D) = BC/BD
BC = BD * sin(D) = 72 * sin(31°) = 72 * 0.5150 = 37.08

There appears to be an error in the given diagram, since the two calculations for BC do not give the same value. We will proceed assuming the diagram is correct, but the given lengths are approximate.

In triangle ABC:
cos(A) = AC/AB
AC = AB * cos(A) = 58 * cos(57°) = 58 * 0.5446 = 31.5868

In triangle BCD:
cos(D) = CD/BD
CD = BD * cos(D) = 72 * cos(31°) = 72 * 0.8572 = 61.7184

AD = AC + CD = 31.5868 + 61.7184 = 93.3052

We will now proceed by assuming BC can be found using sine.
Let's assume AB = 58 and angle A = 57 are correct.
Then BC = 58 * sin(57) = 48.6446

Let's assume BD = 72 and angle D = 31 are correct.
Then BC = 72 * sin(31) = 37.08

We need to make a choice, as they cannot both be correct. Let's go with the AB length.
AC = 58*cos(57) = 31.5868
Then CD = sqrt(72^2 - 48.6446^2) = sqrt(5184 - 2366.30) = sqrt(2817.7) = 53.082
So AD = AC + CD = 31.5868 + 53.082 = 84.6688 = 84.67

Now let's go with the BD length.
CD = 72*cos(31) = 61.7184
Then AC = sqrt(58^2 - 37.08^2) = sqrt(3364 - 1374.93) = sqrt(1989.07) = 44.6
So AD = AC + CD = 61.7184 + 44.6 = 106.3184 = 106.32

Since the values of BC don't line up, we will assume the diagram is correct, but we need to correct one of the values.
Let's find angle D using BC from AB.
sin(D) = BC/BD = 48.6446/72 = 0.6756, so D = 42.5°
Let's find angle A using BC from BD.
sin(A) = BC/AB = 37.08/58 = 0.6393, so A = 39.75°

The most likely issue is with the sides lengths. Let's keep the angles.
BC = 58 * sin(57°) = 48.6446
BD = BC/sin(31) = 48.6446/0.5150 = 94.4555, but is given as 72, so we cannot solve this.
