QUESTION:
In triangle ABC above, angle A is 60° and triangle ABC is equilateral. The length of AB is 3, and D is the midpoint of AC. What is the length of BC?

CHOICES:
A.3*\sqrt{3}
B.4*\sqrt{2}
C.4*\sqrt{3}
D.6*\sqrt{2}
E.5*\sqrt{3}

Given that triangle ABC is equilateral, all its sides are equal, and all angles are 60°. We are given that the length of AB is 3. Since all sides of an equilateral triangle are equal, BC = AB = AC = 3.
The length of BC is 3.
Now we compare this value with the given options.
A. 3*\sqrt{3} ≈ 3 * 1.732 = 5.196
B. 4*\sqrt{2} ≈ 4 * 1.414 = 5.656
C. 4*\sqrt{3} ≈ 4 * 1.732 = 6.928
D. 6*\sqrt{2} ≈ 6 * 1.414 = 8.484
E. 5*\sqrt{3} ≈ 5 * 1.732 = 8.660

However, the problem states that triangle ABC is equilateral, so AB=BC=CA=3. But angle A is 60, and angle ADB is 60.
Because ABC is equilateral, AB = BC = CA. Since AB = 3, then BC = 3.

But, since the question asks for the length of BC, and triangle ABC is equilateral with AB = 3, BC must be equal to 3. However, none of the answer choices is 3. Something seems incorrect in the original question. If angle A is 60 degrees and triangle ABC is equilateral, it means angle B and angle C is also 60 degrees.

If triangle ABD has two angles of 60 degrees, the third angle ADB = 180 - 60 - 60 = 60. Thus, triangle ABD is equilateral. Given that AB = 3, then AD = BD = 3.
Since D is the midpoint of AC, AD = DC = 3. Then AC = AD + DC = 3 + 3 = 6.

Since ABC is equilateral triangle AC = BC = AB = 6
But the length of AB is 3. And triangle ABC is equilateral. So BC should be 3.

There seems to be conflicting information given. If AB = 3 and triangle ABC is equilateral, then BC = 3. But none of the answers is 3. However, considering that A is 60 degrees and ABD is 60 degrees, and knowing that AB = 3.
If the question is correct, and if AB = 3, then BC = 3. None of the answers match. If the question meant triangle ABD to be equilateral, where AB=AD=BD=3. Since AD = DC, then DC is also 3.

However, if we ignore the equilateral thing and try to look for which possible value is closest.

None of the answer choices is close to 3. Maybe there is an error in the transcription of answer choices or the problem statement.
