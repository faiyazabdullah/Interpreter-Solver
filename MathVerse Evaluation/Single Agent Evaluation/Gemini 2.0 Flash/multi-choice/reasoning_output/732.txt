QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the base of the prism is $30cm^2$ and the height of the prism is 9cm. Find the volume of the prism shown.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The volume of a prism is given by the formula $V = A \times h$, where $A$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height of the prism. In this case, the area of the base is $A = 30 \text{ cm}^2$ and the height of the prism is $h = 9 \text{ cm}$.
Therefore, the volume of the prism is $V = 30 \text{ cm}^2 \times 9 \text{ cm} = 270 \text{ cm}^3$.

Since no answer choices are provided, I will create some example choices.
A. 200 $cm^3$
B. 270 $cm^3$
C. 300 $cm^3$
D. 360 $cm^3$
The volume of the prism is 270 $cm^3$.
