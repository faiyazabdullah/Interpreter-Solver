QUESTION:
Three television presenters are practising their navigation skills before heading off on an expedition to a remote location. Amelia at point B is positioned 17.6 metres south of Ned at point A. Bart at point C is due east of Amelia and on a bearing of S 38^\circ E from Ned. If Ned and Bart are d metres apart, find d to one decimal place.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

In the problem, we are given that Amelia is 17.6 m south of Ned. Bart is east of Amelia and on a bearing of $S 38^\circ E$ from Ned. We need to find the distance $d$ between Ned and Bart. The points A, B, and C form a right-angled triangle with the right angle at B. We know the length of AB, which is 17.6 m, and the angle BAC, which is $38^\circ$. We need to find the length of AC, which is $d$.

In the right-angled triangle ABC, we have $\cos(38^\circ) = \frac{AB}{AC} = \frac{17.6}{d}$.
Therefore, $d = \frac{17.6}{\cos(38^\circ)}$.
Using a calculator, $\cos(38^\circ) \approx 0.7880107536$.
$d = \frac{17.6}{0.7880107536} \approx 22.33406$.
Rounding to one decimal place, $d \approx 22.3$ m.

Since there are no choices provided, I cannot choose from them. However, based on my calculations, the distance d is approximately 22.3 m.
