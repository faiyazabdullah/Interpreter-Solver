QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, CD is a plane mirror, the light is emitted from point A, reflected by point E on CD, and irradiated to point B. If the incident angle is α, AC perpendicular  CD, BD perpendicular  CD, the feet of perpendicular are C, D, and AC = 3.0, BD = 6.0, CD = 10.0, then the length of the line segment ED is ()

CHOICES:
A:\frac{20}{3}
B:\frac{10}{3}
C:7
D:\frac{14}{3}

Since CD is a plane mirror, ∠AEC = ∠DEB. Also, since AC ⊥ CD and BD ⊥ CD, we have ∠ACE = ∠BDE = 90°. Therefore, △ACE ∽ △BDE.
Let ED = x, then CE = CD - ED = 10 - x.
Since △ACE ∽ △BDE, we have AC/BD = CE/ED, which means 3/6 = (10-x)/x.
So, 1/2 = (10-x)/x, which implies x = 2(10-x) = 20 - 2x.
Then, 3x = 20, so x = 20/3.
Therefore, ED = 20/3.
