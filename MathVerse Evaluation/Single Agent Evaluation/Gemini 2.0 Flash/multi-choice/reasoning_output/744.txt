QUESTION:
The volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere is given by the formula:

V=\frac{1}{4}\pi h\left(4r^2-h^2\right)

where r is the radius of the sphere and h is the height of the cylinder.

What is the radius of the sphere if the volume of the cylinder is 13.75\pi cm3 and the height of the cylinder is 5 cm?

CHOICES:
No choices found.

We are given the formula for the volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere:
V=\frac{1}{4}\pi h\left(4r^2-h^2\right)
where r is the radius of the sphere and h is the height of the cylinder.

We are given that the volume of the cylinder is 13.75\pi cm3 and the height of the cylinder is 5 cm. We need to find the radius of the sphere.
We can plug in the given values into the formula:
13.  75\pi = \frac{1}{4}\pi (5)(4r^2 - 5^2)
14.  75\pi = \frac{5}{4}\pi (4r^2 - 25)
Divide both sides by \pi:
15.  75 = \frac{5}{4} (4r^2 - 25)
Multiply both sides by 4/5:
\frac{4}{5} * 13.75 = 4r^2 - 25
16.  0 = 4r^2 - 25
Add 25 to both sides:
17.  0 = 4r^2
Divide both sides by 4:
18.  0 / 4 = r^2
6 = r^2
Take the square root of both sides:
r = \sqrt{11}
r = 3.31662479...

Now we need to check if there are answer choices that we need to match. Since there are no choices, we stop here.
However, the problem doesn't seem to ask for a value for r. We are given the volume of the cylinder is 13.75\pi cm3 and the height of the cylinder is 5 cm. We need to find the radius of the sphere.

V=\frac{1}{4}\pi h\left(4r^2-h^2\right)
13.  75\pi = \frac{1}{4}\pi (5)(4r^2-5^2)
14.  75 = \frac{1}{4} (5)(4r^2-25)
15.  75 = \frac{5}{4} (4r^2 - 25)
\frac{4}{5} * 13.75 = 4r^2 - 25
16.  0 = 4r^2 - 25
17.  0 + 25 = 4r^2
50.  0 = 4r^2
51.  0 / 4 = r^2
12.1 = r^2
52.  25 = r^2
Take the square root of both sides:
r = \sqrt{13.75}
r = \sqrt{\frac{55}{4}}
r=3.5 cm
