QUESTION:
The area $A$ of the sector below is 140.28 (cm)^2. We wish to find the length of the radius, then the perimeter.

From the image, we can see that the triangle has two sides with equal length. This means the triangle is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, the two angles opposite the equal sides are equal. One of the angles is given as 27 degrees. So the other angle is also 27 degrees.

Now let's find the third angle of the triangle. Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, the third angle is 180 - 27 - 27 = 180 - 54 = 126 degrees.

The angle of the sector is 126 degrees. To find the area of the sector, we can use the formula:
Area = (angle/360) * pi * r^2
Here, the area A is given as 140.28 cm^2. The angle is 126 degrees.
So, we have:
140.28 = (126/360) * pi * r^2
r^2 = (140.28 * 360) / (126 * pi)
r^2 = (140.28 * 360) / (126 * 3.14159265359)
r^2 = 50500.8 / 395.8407
r^2 = 127.576
r = sqrt(127.576)
r = 11.295
Rounding to one decimal place, we get r = 11.3 cm.

Now, let's find the perimeter of the sector. The perimeter is given by the formula:
Perimeter = 2r + arc length
Arc length = (angle/360) * 2 * pi * r
Arc length = (126/360) * 2 * pi * 11.3
Arc length = (126/360) * 2 * 3.14159265359 * 11.3
Arc length = 0.35 * 2 * 3.14159265359 * 11.3
Arc length = 0.7 * 3.14159265359 * 11.3
Arc length = 24.865 cm
Perimeter = 2 * 11.3 + 24.865
Perimeter = 22.6 + 24.865
Perimeter = 47.465
Perimeter = 47.5 (to one decimal place)

The question asks for the length of the radius.
Radius, r = 11.3 cm
