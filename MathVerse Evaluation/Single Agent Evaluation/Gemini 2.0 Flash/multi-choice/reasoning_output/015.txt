Given that b is perpendicular to c, then the angle between b and c is 90 degrees. Let's denote the rotation angle as x. If line b is parallel to line a, then the corresponding angles must be equal. The angle between line a and line c is given as 70 degrees. So after the rotation, the angle between line b and line c will be 90 - x.
If b is parallel to a, then 90 - x + 70 = 180 is wrong.
Since line b is perpendicular to c initially, the angle between b and c is 90 degrees. If b rotates clockwise by x degrees to become parallel to a, then the new angle between b and c is 90-x. For b to be parallel to a, the angle between a and c (which is 70) and the angle between b and c (which is 90-x) must be such that corresponding angles are equal. In other words, the angle between line a and line c should be equal to the supplementary angle of the angle between rotated line b and line c. Then 180 - (90 - x) = 70 is incorrect.
We know that angle 1 = 70 degrees.
After rotating line b clockwise by x degrees, line b will become parallel to a. The angle formed by line b and line c will be 90 - x degrees. Since line a and line b are parallel, corresponding angles formed by these two parallel lines and line c will be equal. The corresponding angle to 70 degree at line a is equal to 90 - x, since b is parallel to a.
So, we have 90 - x = 20 (Since angle made by straight line a is 70, and it will be equal to the corresponding angle made by line b. Corresponding angles 180- (90-angle)  = 70, we have 90 + angle equals 70.)
Since angle 1 is 70 degrees, the alternate exterior angle would also be 70 degrees if the lines were parallel. The current angle formed by line b and line c is 90 degrees. The required angle is 70 degrees. So the rotation angle is 90 - 70 = 20.
Then, the alternate interior angle would be equal, which would be (90 - x)= 110 , if a and b are parallel.
x=20 degrees
Let us solve using corresponding angles. The angle a and line c is 70. In order for b and a to be parallel, the corresponding angle for 70 has to be 70.  Therefore it will rotate from A to 20 degree clockwise.
Therefore x=20 degrees.
