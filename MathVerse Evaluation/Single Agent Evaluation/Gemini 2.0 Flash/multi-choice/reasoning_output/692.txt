The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.  We are given a cylindrical pipe with an outer radius of 6 cm and an inner radius of 4 cm, and a length (height) of 13 cm.  The volume of the concrete is the difference between the volume of the outer cylinder and the volume of the inner cylinder.

The volume of the outer cylinder is $V_{outer} = \pi (6^2) (13) = \pi (36)(13) = 468\pi$.
The volume of the inner cylinder is $V_{inner} = \pi (4^2) (13) = \pi (16)(13) = 208\pi$.

The volume of the concrete is $V_{concrete} = V_{outer} - V_{inner} = 468\pi - 208\pi = 260\pi$.
Using the value of $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we get $260\pi \approx 260(3.14159) \approx 816.8134$.

Rounding to two decimal places, the volume of concrete required is approximately 816.81 cubic centimeters.
