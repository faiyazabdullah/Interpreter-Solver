The composite figure consists of a cone and a hemisphere joined at their bases.
The radius of the base is 4 cm, and the height of the cone is 10 cm.
We need to find the surface area of the composite figure.
The surface area of the composite figure is the sum of the curved surface area of the cone and the curved surface area of the hemisphere.
The curved surface area of the cone is $\pi r l$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $l$ is the slant height of the cone.
The slant height $l$ is given by $l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$, where $h$ is the height of the cone.
$l = \sqrt{4^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{16 + 100} = \sqrt{116} \approx 10.77$ cm.
The curved surface area of the cone is $\pi r l = \pi (4)(10.77) = 43.08\pi \approx 135.39$ cm$^2$.
The curved surface area of the hemisphere is $2\pi r^2 = 2\pi (4^2) = 2\pi (16) = 32\pi \approx 100.53$ cm$^2$.
The surface area of the composite figure is the sum of the curved surface area of the cone and the curved surface area of the hemisphere.
Surface area $= 135.39 + 100.53 = 235.92$ cm$^2$.

The curved surface area of the cone is $\pi r l$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $l$ is the slant height of the cone.
The slant height $l$ is given by $l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$, where $h$ is the height of the cone.
$l = \sqrt{4^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{16 + 100} = \sqrt{116} \approx 10.7703$ cm.
The curved surface area of the cone is $\pi r l = \pi (4)(10.7703) = 43.0812\pi \approx 135.397$ cm$^2$.
The curved surface area of the hemisphere is $2\pi r^2 = 2\pi (4^2) = 2\pi (16) = 32\pi \approx 100.531$ cm$^2$.
The surface area of the composite figure is the sum of the curved surface area of the cone and the curved surface area of the hemisphere.
Surface area $= 135.397 + 100.531 = 235.928 \approx 235.93$ cm$^2$.
