QUESTION:
\odot P \cong \odot Q. Chord R S is on \odot P with length 3x and chord T U is on \odot Q with length 7 x - 44. Find x.

CHOICES:
A:7
B:11
C:22
D:44

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the problem statement, we are given that circle P is congruent to circle Q. This means that their radii are equal. Also, RS is a chord in circle P and TU is a chord in circle Q.
We have RS = 3x and TU = 7x - 44.
From the diagram, we see that RS passes through the center of circle P, so RS is a diameter.
Similarly, TU passes through the center of circle Q, so TU is a diameter.
Since the circles are congruent, their diameters must be equal. Therefore, RS = TU.
So, we have the equation 3x = 7x - 44.
Subtract 7x from both sides: -4x = -44
Divide both sides by -4: x = 11

Now we compare this result with the answer choices.
A: 7
B: 11
C: 22
D: 44
Our calculated value of x is 11, which matches answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
