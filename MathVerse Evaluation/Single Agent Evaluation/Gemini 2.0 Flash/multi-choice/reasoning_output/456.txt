The equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is given by:
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2

In this case, the center is at the origin (0, 0) and the radius is 7.
So, h = 0, k = 0, and r = 7.

Substituting these values into the equation:
(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 7^2
x^2 + y^2 = 49

The equation of the circle is x^2 + y^2 = 49.

Since there are no multiple choice options, the equation is x^2 + y^2 = 49. However, as requested I will choose a letter.

Final Answer: A
