Since OC is perpendicular to OB, angle BOC = 90 degrees. Since OD is perpendicular to AB, angle ADB = 90 degrees. Also, OB = OC = 1, since they are radii of the circle.
Since OD is perpendicular to AB, D is the midpoint of AB.
Angle BAC = 1/2 * angle BOC = 1/2 * 90 = 45 degrees.
Since angle ADB is a right angle, triangle ADB is a right triangle.
Since OC is perpendicular to OB, BC = sqrt(OB^2 + OC^2) = sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).
Since angle BAC = 45 degrees, and angle ADB = 90 degrees, then angle ABD is also 45 degrees.
Triangle ADB is an isosceles right triangle.
Then AD = BD.
Since angle ACB = 90 degrees, ABC is a right triangle with hypotenuse AB.
Also AB = sqrt(2)
Angle ABC = 45
Consider triangle ABC
Angle BAC = 45 and BOC = 90.
Since O is the center of the circle, BO = CO = 1
Since OD is perpendicular to AB, then OD bisects AB, then AD = BD = AB/2
AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2
Triangle BOC is a right isosceles triangle.
Since O is the center and OC is perpendicular to OB, then BC = sqrt(2) and angle BOC = 90
Thus BAC = 45 degrees. AB is the diameter * sin ( ACB ).
AO = BO = CO = 1
Since OD is perpendicular to AB then OD must bisect AB
Angle AOB = 2*ACB and ABC + BAC = 90.
We are looking for AE^2 + CE^2
Angle ADB = 90. So AB = diameter = 2
Angle ACB = 90 and BAC = 45 and ABC = 45.
Also AC = AB cos(BAC) = 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).
AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2
Then AD = BD, AC^2 = AE^2 + CE^2 = (AD + DE)^2 + (CD)^2
Consider right triangle ACB. Let AC = x and BC = y. Since BAC = 45 and ABC = 45
The AB = diameter = 2. Then x^2 + y^2 = 4
We have OD perpendicular to AB and OD intersects AC at E.
AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2. Angle ABC = 45 and ACB = 90. BAC = 45
So ABC is a right isosceles triangle. Then CA = CB. Then 2AC^2 = AB^2, so 2 AC^2 = 4 and AC = sqrt(2)
Angle AEB = 90, but ABE = 45 and BAE = 45. Triangle ABC has sides sqrt(2) and hypotenuse is 2.
Angle ACB = 1/2 = AB ( arc AB) * r^2; 90 / 2* PI = ...
AE^2 + CE^2
Draw CF perpendicular to AB, then AD = DB and CF is the median, CF = AD = DB
Consider AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2 = AB ^2 cos^2 BAC +

AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2 = (sqrt(2))^2 = 2
Since AE^2 + CE^2 = AC^2. Also AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2
AB^2 = 4. AC^2 = 2 and BC = sqrt(2)
