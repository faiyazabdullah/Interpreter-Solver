QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 3.3\right)$, and it has a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 9.8)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The midline of the trigonometric function is the horizontal line halfway between its maximum and minimum values. The y-coordinate of the midline is 3.3, and the maximum value of the function is 9.8. The amplitude of the function is the distance from the midline to the maximum value, which is the difference between the maximum value and the y-coordinate of the midline. The amplitude is therefore $9.8 - 3.3 = 6.5$.
