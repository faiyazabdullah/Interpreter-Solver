Since AB is tangent to circle O at point B, then angle OBA = 90 degrees.
In triangle AOB, angle A = 36 degrees, so angle AOB = 180 - 90 - 36 = 54 degrees.
Since angle AOB and angle COB are supplementary angles, angle COB = 180 - 54 = 126 degrees.
However, angle AOB and angle A = 36. Since AB is tangent to the circle at point B, angle OBA = 90 degrees. Therefore, angle AOB = 180 - 90 - 36 = 54 degrees.
Since OB = OC (radii of the same circle), triangle OBC is an isosceles triangle.
Then angle OBC = angle OCB.
Also, angle BOC = 2 * angle BAC.
angle AOB = 180 - 90 - 36 = 54
angle BOC = 54 (they are the same)
angle C = 1/2 * angle AOB
angle OCB = (180 - angle BOC)/2
angle BOC = 180 - 90 - 36 = 54
angle OCB = (180 - 54)/2 = 126/2 = 63
Since AB is tangent to circle O at point B, we have $\angle OBA = 90^{\circ}$.
In $\triangle AOB$, $\angle A = 36^{\circ}$, so $\angle AOB = 180^{\circ} - \angle A - \angle OBA = 180^{\circ} - 36^{\circ} - 90^{\circ} = 54^{\circ}$.
From the inscribed angle theorem, we know that $\angle C = \frac{1}{2}\angle AOB$, but this only applies if angle A is outside the circle.
We are given that AO intersects the circle at C.
Since OB = OC (radii), $\triangle OBC$ is an isosceles triangle, which means that $\angle OBC = \angle OCB = \angle C$.
Also, $\angle BOC = 180^{\circ} - 2\angle C$.
$\angle AOB + \angle BOC = 180^{\circ}$ does not apply here, because the figure shows that point C is on line OA
So, the extended line of AO intersects circle O at C
$\angle BOC = 180 - \angle OBA - \angle A = 180 - 90 -36 = 54$
$\angle BOC + \angle AOB = 180$
In $\triangle OBC$, $OB=OC$. So $\angle OBC = \angle OCB = \angle C$.
$\angle BOC = 180^{\circ} - 2\angle C$

The exterior angle of $\triangle OBC$ at $O$ is equal to $\angle OBA + \angle A$.
So $\angle AOB = \angle OBC + \angle OCB = 2\angle C$, where $\angle AOB = 54^{\circ}$.
Thus, $2\angle C = 54^{\circ}$, and $\angle C = 27^{\circ}$.
