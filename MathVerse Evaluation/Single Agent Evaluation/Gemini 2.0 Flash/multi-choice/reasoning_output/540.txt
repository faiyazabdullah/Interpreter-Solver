GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph intersects its midline at $(1.25,-2.75)$ and has a minimum point at $(4.75,-6.25)$. The horizontal distance between the midline intersection and the minimum point represents a quarter of the period.

The x-coordinate of the midline intersection is $1.25$ and the x-coordinate of the minimum point is $4.75$. The distance between these two points is $4.75 - 1.25 = 3.5$. Since this is a quarter of the period, we multiply this distance by 4 to find the full period.

Period = $4 \times 3.5 = 14$.
