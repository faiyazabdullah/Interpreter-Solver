Given that JKLM is a trapezoid with JK parallel to ML, JM = 6, KL = 6, and angle JML = 80 degrees. We want to find the measure of angle K.
Since JM = KL, the trapezoid JKLM is an isosceles trapezoid. In an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal. Therefore, angle JML = angle KLM. Since angle JML is 80 degrees, angle KLM is also 80 degrees.
The sum of the angles in a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Also, since JK is parallel to ML, we have that angle JML + angle MJK = 180 degrees and angle KLM + angle JKL = 180 degrees.
Thus, angle MJK = 180 - 80 = 100 degrees, and angle JKL = 180 - 80 = 100 degrees.
Therefore, the measure of angle K is 100 degrees.
