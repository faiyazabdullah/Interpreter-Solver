GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The function is a piecewise function.
For x < 1, the line passes through (0, 1) and (1, 0).
The slope is (0 - 1) / (1 - 0) = -1.
The y-intercept is 1.
So, the equation is y = -x + 1.

For x > 1, the line passes through (1, 0) and (3, -2).
The slope is (-2 - 0) / (3 - 1) = -2 / 2 = -1.
Using point-slope form, y - 0 = -1(x - 1), so y = -x + 1.

However, the two lines meet at (1, 0). The first line is defined for x <= 1, and the second for x >= 1.
The slope is -1 for x < 1.
For x > 1, the line passes through (1, 0) and (3, -2). The slope is (-2 - 0)/(3 - 1) = -2/2 = -1. So y = -x + 1 is wrong.
Let us assume that we have y = m(x-1)
-2 = m(3 - 1)
-2 = 2m
m = -1.
y - 0 = -1(x - 1),  y = -x + 1

For x > 1, the line passes through (3, -2) and (1, 0). The absolute value function is of the form |x - a|. The vertex is (3, -2).
Let y = |x - a| + b.
y = |x - a| - 2
At x = 3, y = -2. This is the vertex.
When x = 1, y = 0
0 = |1 - a| - 2
|1 - a| = 2
1 - a = 2, or 1 - a = -2
a = -1, or a = 3

f(x) = -x + 1 for x <= 1
f(x) = -(x - 3) - 2 for x >= 1.
At x = 1, f(x) = |x - 3| - 2 = |1 - 3| - 2 = | -2| - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0.
f(x) = |x - 3| - 2
f(0) = |0 - 3| - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
f(1) = |1 - 3| - 2 = |-2| - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0.
f(3) = |3 - 3| - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2.
f(5) = |5 - 3| - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0.
f(-1) = |-1 - 3| - 2 = |-4| - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2.

The equation for the graphed function is f(x) = -|x - 1| + 1
