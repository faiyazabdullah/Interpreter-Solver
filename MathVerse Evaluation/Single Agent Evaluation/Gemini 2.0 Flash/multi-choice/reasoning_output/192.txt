QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, point P is outside circle O. PA and PB are connected. the straight lines PA and PB are the two tangents of circle O. If angle APB = 120.0, the radius of circle O is 10.0, then the length of chord AB is ()

CHOICES:
A:5
B:10
C:10√{3}
D:5√{3}

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Since PA and PB are tangents to the circle O at points A and B respectively, OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB. Also, OA = OB = 10 (radius of the circle).
Angle APB = 120 degrees.
In quadrilateral PAOB, the sum of the angles is 360 degrees.
Angle AOB = 360 - Angle PAO - Angle PBO - Angle APB
Angle AOB = 360 - 90 - 90 - 120 = 60 degrees.
In triangle AOB, OA = OB, so triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle.
Since angle AOB = 60 degrees, triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle.
Therefore, AB = OA = OB = 10.
