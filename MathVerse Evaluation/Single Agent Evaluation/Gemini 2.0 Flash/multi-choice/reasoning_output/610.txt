QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What is the average rate of change?

CHOICES:
No choices found.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows a horizontal line at y = 6. This means the number of earthquakes is always 6, regardless of the year.
The average rate of change is the change in the number of earthquakes divided by the change in years.
Since the number of earthquakes is constant, the change in the number of earthquakes is always 0.
Therefore, the average rate of change is 0.

Since there are no answer choices, the rate of change is 0. This is not given in the answer choices, but the rate of change must be 0.

Final Answer: A
