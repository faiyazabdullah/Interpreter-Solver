B.30*\degree
C.45*\degree
D.60*\degree
E.75*\degree

Since AD is the angle bisector of angle BAC and AD is perpendicular to BC, triangle ABC must be an isosceles triangle with AB = AC.
We are given that AB = 6 and BD = 3. Since triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC and AD is the altitude, AD is also the median. Therefore, BD = CD = 3. So BC = BD + CD = 3 + 3 = 6.
Since AB = BC = AC = 6, triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle. Therefore, each angle in triangle ABC is 60 degrees.
Thus, the measure of angle BAC is 60 degrees.
