QUESTION:
In remote locations, photographers must keep track of their position from their base. One morning a photographer sets out from base, represented by point B, to the edge of an ice shelf at point S on a bearing of 055°. She then walked on a bearing of 145° to point P, which is 916 metres due east of base.

If the photographer were to walk back to her base from point P, what is the total distance she would have travelled? Round your answer to one decimal place.

The problem describes a triangle BSP, where B is the base, S is the point on the ice shelf, and P is the final position. The bearing of S from B is 055°, meaning the angle NBS is 55°, where N is the North direction. The bearing of P from S is 145°, meaning the angle between the North direction at S and SP is 145°. Also, we know that P is 916 meters due east of B. Thus, BP = 916 meters, and angle PBN is 90°. This tells us that angle PBS = 90 - 55 = 35°.

Now, we need to find angle BPS. Since the bearing of P from S is 145°, the angle between the dashed line going north from S and SP is 145°. The angle between the dashed line and the line pointing south from S is 180°. Therefore, the angle between the line going south from S and SP is 180 - 145 = 35°. Since angle B is a straight line, the angle PSB is 180 - 35 = 145-90 = 55 degrees.

Now, angle BSP = 180 - (145 - 90) = 180- 55 =  125° if you extend the line north from S.  If we measure from the North at S to line SB its 145-55 = angle B =  55 and SB. So angle PSB =145-90 = 55 degrees.

Angle PBS = 90 - 55 = 35 degrees. Since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°, angle BPS = 180 - (35+55) = 180-90 = angle BPS is 180-90 = 90. Angle BPS = 180 - (35 + 145-90)  55 degrees +35 degree =90 so BPS= 90

The triangle BSP is right-angled at S.

We have BP = 916 meters. We need to find BS and SP.

sin(35) = SP/BP = SP/916, so SP = 916*sin(35) = 916*0.5736 = 525.4
cos(35) = BS/BP = BS/916, so BS = 916*cos(35) = 916*0.8192 = 750.4

Total distance = BS + SP + PB = 750.4 + 525.4 + 916 = 2191.8 meters.

BS = 916 cos(35) = 750.387
SP = 916 sin(35) = 525.414

Total distance = 750.387 + 525.414 + 916 = 2191.801

Rounding to one decimal place: 2191.8 meters.
