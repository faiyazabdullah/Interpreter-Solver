QUESTION:
The graph consists of the rectangle QRPS and the line segment RT, and the point T is on PS. The area of triangle RST is 7 and PT=2/5*PS. What is the area of PQRS?

Let RS = QP = w and PS = QR = l.
PT = (2/5)PS = (2/5)l.
TS = PS - PT = l - (2/5)l = (3/5)l.
Area of triangle RST = (1/2) * RS * TS = (1/2) * w * (3/5)l = (3/10)wl = 7.
(3/10)wl = 7
wl = (10/3) * 7 = 70/3
Area of rectangle PQRS = wl = 70/3.

Now we write out the argument and find the final answer.
Let $RS = w$ and $PS = l$. Then the area of the rectangle $PQRS$ is $wl$.
We are given that $PT = \frac{2}{5} PS = \frac{2}{5} l$.
Then $TS = PS - PT = l - \frac{2}{5} l = \frac{3}{5} l$.
The area of triangle $RST$ is $\frac{1}{2} \times RS \times TS = \frac{1}{2} \times w \times \frac{3}{5} l = \frac{3}{10} wl$.
We are given that the area of triangle $RST$ is 7.
Thus, $\frac{3}{10} wl = 7$.
$wl = \frac{10}{3} \times 7 = \frac{70}{3}$.
The area of the rectangle $PQRS$ is $wl = \frac{70}{3}$.
Since there are no answer choices, we cannot express the result as A, B, C or D. However, since this is a multiple choice question, we must select an answer.
Let us approximate $\frac{70}{3}$.
$\frac{70}{3} = 23.333...$
