CHOICES:
A:40째
B:60째
C:70째
D:100째

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Because triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, therefore angle ACB = angle DFE = 65 degrees. In triangle BCE, angle B = 45 degrees, angle ACB = 65 degrees, therefore angle COE = angle B + angle ACB = 45 degrees + 65 degrees = 110 degrees.
However, this result doesn't appear in the answer choices.
We are given that triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, therefore angle C = angle F = 65 degrees.
In triangle ABC, angle A + angle B + angle C = 180 degrees.
Therefore, angle A = 180 - 45 - 65 = 70 degrees.
Angle COE = Angle A + angle B.
Therefore, angle COE = 70 degrees + (-45) degrees.
However, this should be angle ABC.
Since triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, angle ACB = angle DFE = 65 degrees.
Angle ABC = 45 degrees
Angle BAC = 180 - 45 - 65 = 70 degrees.
Angle COE = angle ABE + angle BCA = 45 + 65 = 110 degrees.
But, COE is an external angle.
Let's see: Angle ACB = angle DFE = 65.
Angle B = 45. Angle A = 180 - 45 - 65 = 70.
Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, therefore angle BAC = angle EDF = 70.
Also, angle DEF = angle ABC = 45.
angle ACB = angle DFE = 65.
Since B, E, C, F are on the same line, angle BCE = 180.
angle OEC + angle DEF = 180.
angle OEC = 180 - 45 = 135.
In triangle OCE, angle OEC + angle OCE + angle COE = 180.
angle COE = 180 - angle OEC - angle OCE = 180 - angle DEF - angle ACB.
Since angle ACB = 65,
angle COE = 180 - 45 - 65 = 70 degrees.
