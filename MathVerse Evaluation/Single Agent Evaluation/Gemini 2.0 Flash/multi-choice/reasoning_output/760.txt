QUESTION:
In the figure above, the circle has center P and radius r. Lines AB and AC are tangent to the circle. If M is the midpoint of segment AC and the measure of angle PMC equals the measure of angle MPC, what is the length, in terms of r, of segment PA?

CHOICES:
A.r + 1
B.2*r
C.r*\sqrt{2}
D.r*\sqrt{3}
E.r*\sqrt{5}

Let the radius of the circle be r. Since AB and AC are tangent to the circle at B and C respectively, we have PB perpendicular to AB and PC perpendicular to AC.
Also, we are given that M is the midpoint of AC, so AM = MC.
We are given that angle PMC = angle MPC. Since the sum of angles in triangle PMC is 180 degrees, we have angle PMC + angle MPC + angle MCP = 180 degrees. Thus, 2*angle PMC + angle MCP = 180 degrees.

Also, since triangle PMC is a right triangle, we have angle PMC + angle MPC + angle PCM = 180 degrees.
Because angle PC is perpendicular to AC, angle PCA = 90 degrees. So we have a right triangle PCA. M is the midpoint of AC, so AM=MC.
In triangle PMC, angle PMC = angle MPC. So triangle PMC is an isosceles triangle and MC = PC = r.
Since M is the midpoint of AC, we have AC = 2MC = 2r.
Now we consider triangle PCA. It is a right triangle with PC = r and AC = 2r.
By Pythagorean theorem, we have PA^2 = PC^2 + AC^2 = r^2 + (2r)^2 = r^2 + 4r^2 = 5r^2.
Therefore, PA = sqrt(5r^2) = r*sqrt(5).
