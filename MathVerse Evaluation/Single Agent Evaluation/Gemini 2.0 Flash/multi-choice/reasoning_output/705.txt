GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

Let's analyze the given trapezoidal prism. We have the following dimensions:
- Height of the prism: 10 cm
- Length of the base rectangle: 13 cm
- Width of the base rectangle: 10 cm
- Height of the top rectangle: 3 cm

To find the surface area, we need to calculate the area of each face and add them up.

1. Base rectangle: Area = length * width = 13 cm * 10 cm = 130 cm²
2. Top rectangle: Area = length * width = 13 cm * 3 cm = 39 cm²
3. Side rectangle: Area = height * width = 10 cm * 10 cm = 100 cm²
4. Another side rectangle: Area = height * width = 10 cm * 13 cm = 130 cm²
5. Trapezoid face (2 of them):
The trapezoid has parallel sides of length 3 cm and 10 cm, and height 10 cm.
Area of trapezoid = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height = (1/2) * (3 cm + 10 cm) * 10 cm = (1/2) * 13 cm * 10 cm = 65 cm²
Since we have two trapezoids, the total area is 2 * 65 cm² = 130 cm²

Total surface area = 130 cm² + 39 cm² + 100 cm² + 130 cm² + 130 cm² = 529 cm²

Therefore, the surface area of the trapezoidal prism is 529 cm².
