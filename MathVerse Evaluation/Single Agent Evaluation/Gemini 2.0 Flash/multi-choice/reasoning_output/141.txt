QUESTION:
While measuring the height of the building, Xiao Ming first measured the shadow length BA of the building on the ground as 15.0 (as shown in the figure), and then set up a benchmark with a height of 2.0 at A, and measured the shadow length AC of the benchmark as 3.0, then the height of the building is ()

CHOICES:
A:10米
B:12米
C:15米
D:22.5米

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the problem, we know that the height of the benchmark and its shadow length form a right triangle, and the height of the building and its shadow length also form a right triangle. Since the sun's rays are parallel, the two triangles are similar.
Let the height of the building be x.
Then $\frac{2}{3} = \frac{x}{15+3}$
$\frac{2}{3} = \frac{x}{18}$
$3x = 36$
$x = 12$

Final Answer: B
