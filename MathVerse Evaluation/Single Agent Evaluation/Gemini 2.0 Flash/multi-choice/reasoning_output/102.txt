QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, points C and D are on circle O, and point C is the midpoint of arc BD, passing point C to draw the perpendicular line EF of AD and it intersects straight line AD at point E, if the radius of circle O is 2.5, the length of AC is 4.0, then the length of CE is ()

CHOICES:
A:3
B:\frac{20}{3}
C:\frac{12}{5}
D:\frac{16}{5}

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Since C is the midpoint of arc BD, arc BC = arc CD. Therefore, angle DAC = angle BAC. Since EF is perpendicular to AD at E, angle AEC = 90 degrees.

Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB = 90 degrees.

In triangle ADC and triangle AEC,
angle DAC = angle EAC
angle ACD = 90-angle ADC
angle ACE = 90 - angle CAD
Since angle AEC = 90 degrees, and angle ACB = 90 degrees, then angles ACE + BCE = 90 degrees

Since angle ADC = angle ABC
Then angle ACE = angle ABC

Consider right triangle ABC, AB = 2 * 2.5 = 5, AC = 4.
BC^2 + AC^2 = AB^2
BC^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
BC^2 + 16 = 25
BC^2 = 9
BC = 3

In triangle AEC and triangle ABC:
angle EAC = angle BAC
angle AEC = angle ACB = 90 degrees
Therefore, triangle AEC is similar to triangle ABC.
AE/AB = AC/BC = CE/AC
Then CE/AC = AC/AB
CE / 4 = 4 / (5)
CE = 16/5
