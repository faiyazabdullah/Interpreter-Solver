GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The solid consists of two hemispheres.
The diameter of the large hemisphere is 12 cm, so the radius is 12/2 = 6 cm.
The diameter of the small hemisphere is 6 cm, so the radius is 6/2 = 3 cm.

The volume of a hemisphere is (2/3) * pi * r^3.
The volume of the large hemisphere is (2/3) * pi * 6^3 = (2/3) * pi * 216 = 144pi cm^3.
The volume of the small hemisphere is (2/3) * pi * 3^3 = (2/3) * pi * 27 = 18pi cm^3.

The total volume of the solid is the sum of the volumes of the two hemispheres:
Volume = 144pi + 18pi = 162pi cm^3.

Now we calculate the numerical value:
162 * pi ≈ 162 * 3.14159265359 ≈ 508.938009881
Rounding to two decimal places, the volume is approximately 508.94 cm^3.
