QUESTION:
There is a blue rectangular with four vertexes (-6,5), (-6,-1), (10,5), (10,-1). The two diagonals are red and intersect with each other at (2,2). Find the coordinates of the midpoint for each diagonal.

No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The two diagonals of the rectangle connect the points (-6, 5) to (10, -1) and (-6, -1) to (10, 5).
To find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting (-6, 5) and (10, -1), we use the midpoint formula:
Midpoint = ( (x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2 )
Midpoint = ( (-6 + 10)/2, (5 + (-1))/2 ) = (4/2, 4/2) = (2, 2)

To find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting (-6, -1) and (10, 5), we use the midpoint formula:
Midpoint = ( (x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2 )
Midpoint = ( (-6 + 10)/2, (-1 + 5)/2 ) = (4/2, 4/2) = (2, 2)

Both diagonals have the same midpoint, which is (2, 2).
