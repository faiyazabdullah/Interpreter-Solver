B:2√{2}cm
C:3√{2}cm
D:4√{2}cm

The radius of the base of the cone is given as 3. The arc length of the sector is the circumference of the base of the cone. The arc length is given by (120/360) * 2 * pi * 3 = 2 * pi. Therefore, the circumference of the base of the cone is 2 * pi * r = 2 * pi * 3. The circumference of the base is also 2 * pi. Thus, the radius of the base of the cone is 1.
The slant height of the cone is the radius of the sector which is 3.
Let h be the height of the cone. Using the Pythagorean theorem, h^2 + r^2 = l^2, where r is the radius of the base of the cone and l is the slant height. So, h^2 + 1^2 = 3^2, or h^2 + 1 = 9. Therefore, h^2 = 8 and h = sqrt(8) = 2 * sqrt(2).
