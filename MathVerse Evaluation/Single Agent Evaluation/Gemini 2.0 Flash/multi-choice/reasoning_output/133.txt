QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to estimate the width of the Jing River, a target point P is selected on the opposite bank of the Jing River, and points Q and S are taken near the bank, so that the points P, Q, and S are in a straight line, and the straight line PS is perpendicular to the river. Choose an appropriate point T on the straight line a passing point S and perpendicular to PS. The intersection of PT and the straight line b passing point Q and perpendicular to PS is R. If QS = 60.0, ST = 120.0, QR = 80.0, then the width of the river PQ is ()

CHOICES:
A:40m
B:120m
C:60m
D:180m

From the problem, we know that QR⊥PS, TS⊥PS, so QR∥TS.
Then △PQR∽△PTS, so $\frac{PQ}{PS}=\frac{QR}{TS}$, which is $\frac{PQ}{PQ+QS}=\frac{QR}{TS}$.
Since QS=60, ST=120, QR=80,
So $\frac{PQ}{PQ+60}=\frac{80}{120}$.
So $\frac{PQ}{PQ+60}=\frac{2}{3}$.
Then 3PQ=2(PQ+60), which is 3PQ=2PQ+120.
So PQ=120.
Therefore, the width of the river PQ is 120m.
