The solid consists of two cylinders with radius 11 and height 8 and one cylinder with radius 4 and height 7.

The volume of each of the two big cylinders is $\pi r^2 h = \pi (11^2)(8) = 968\pi$.  The volume of the smaller cylinder is $\pi r^2 h = \pi (4^2)(7) = 112\pi$.  The total volume is $2(968\pi) + 112\pi = 1936\pi + 112\pi = 2048\pi$.

Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we get $2048\pi \approx 2048(3.14159) \approx 6433.98$.  Rounding to one decimal place gives 6434.0.
