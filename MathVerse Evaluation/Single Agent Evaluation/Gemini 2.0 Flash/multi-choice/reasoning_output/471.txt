The given points on the semicircle are (-7, 0), (-5, 5), (0, 7), (5, 5), and (7, 0).
Since the semicircle passes through (-7, 0) and (7, 0), the center of the circle lies on the y-axis. Let the center be (0, k) and the radius be r.
The equation of the circle is (x - 0)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2, or x^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.
Since (7, 0) lies on the circle, we have 7^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2, which simplifies to 49 + k^2 = r^2.
Since (0, 7) lies on the circle, we have 0^2 + (7 - k)^2 = r^2, which simplifies to (7 - k)^2 = r^2, or 49 - 14k + k^2 = r^2.
Equating the two expressions for r^2, we have 49 + k^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2.
This simplifies to 0 = -14k, so k = 0.
Then r^2 = 49 + 0^2 = 49, so r = 7.
The equation of the circle is x^2 + y^2 = 49.
However, we are given that the graph represents a semicircle. Since the y-values are all non-negative, we have y >= 0.
Solving for y, we get y^2 = 49 - x^2, so y = sqrt(49 - x^2).
The equation of the semicircle is y = sqrt(49 - x^2).
