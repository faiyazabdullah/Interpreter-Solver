QUESTION:
There are two curves with a vertical asymptote x=3. One curve passes (1,0), and another curve passes (4,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given function is increasing on the interval (3,4) and decreasing on the intervals (-inf,1) and (4, inf). From the graph, the function is decreasing to (1,0) and increasing to x=3 and then decreasing from x=3 to x=4 and then decreasing after (4,0).
On (-inf, 1) is decreasing.
On (1,3) is decreasing.
On (3,4) is increasing.
On (4, inf) is decreasing.
