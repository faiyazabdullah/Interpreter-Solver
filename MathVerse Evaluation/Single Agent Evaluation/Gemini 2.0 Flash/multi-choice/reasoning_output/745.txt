QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The soft drink can is a cylinder with height 13 cm and radius 3 cm, so the diameter is 6 cm. The longest straw that can fit in the can is the diagonal of the rectangle formed by the height and the diameter of the cylinder. Let L be the length of the longest straw. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have
L^2 = 13^2 + 6^2
L^2 = 169 + 36
L^2 = 205
L = sqrt(205)
L â‰ˆ 14.3178
Rounding down to the nearest cm, we have L = 14.
