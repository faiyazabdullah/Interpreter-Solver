Let the height of the rectangle be $h = 63$.
Let the angle enclosed by the purple arc be $\theta = 67^\circ$.
Let the angle pointed by the arrow be $\alpha = 39^\circ$.
We need to find the value of $x$.

From the figure, we can see two right-angled triangles.
In the first triangle, we have the height as 63 and the angle between the hypotenuse and the base as $67^\circ$.
Let the base of this triangle be $x_1$.
Then, we can use the tangent function:
$\tan(67^\circ) = \frac{63}{x_1}$
$x_1 = \frac{63}{\tan(67^\circ)}$

In the second triangle, we have the height as 63 and the angle between the hypotenuse and the base as $39^\circ + 67^\circ = 106^\circ$.
However, we are given that the angle pointed by the arrow is $39^\circ$. Let the base of this triangle be $y$. Then the angle opposite to the base is $90 - 39 = 51$ degrees. Therefore,
$\tan(51^\circ) = \frac{y}{63}$
$y = 63 \tan(51^\circ)$

The length of the base of the rectangle is $w$.
We have $y = w$.
We need to find $x$.
The length $x$ is the difference between $w$ and $x_1$.
$x = w - x_1 = y - x_1$
$x = 63\tan(51^\circ) - \frac{63}{\tan(67^\circ)}$
$x = 63\tan(51^\circ) - 63\cot(67^\circ)$
$x = 63(\tan(51^\circ) - \cot(67^\circ))$
$\tan(51^\circ) \approx 1.2349$
$\cot(67^\circ) = \frac{1}{\tan(67^\circ)} \approx \frac{1}{2.3559} \approx 0.4245$
$x = 63(1.2349 - 0.4245)$
$x = 63(0.8104)$
$x = 51.0552$

So, $x \approx 51.1$
