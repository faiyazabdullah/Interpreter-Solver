The given angle α is 130°. Let's call the angle adjacent to α, angle x. Since α and x form a straight line, we have:
x + α = 180°
x + 130° = 180°
x = 180° - 130°
x = 50°

In the right-angled triangle, one angle is 90°, and another angle is x = 50°. The third angle in the triangle can be found as follows:
Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°
90° + 50° + y = 180°
140° + y = 180°
y = 180° - 140°
y = 40°

Angle y and β form a straight line. Therefore,
y + β = 180°
40° + β = 180°
β = 180° - 40°
β = 140°

However, upon closer examination of the figure, we can use the property of the exterior angle.
The angle α = 130°. Its vertically opposite angle is also 130°.
Let the angles of the triangle be A, B, and C. One angle is 90°.
The exterior angle of the triangle is 130°.
Therefore, 130° = β + 90°
β = 130° - 90°
β = 40°
