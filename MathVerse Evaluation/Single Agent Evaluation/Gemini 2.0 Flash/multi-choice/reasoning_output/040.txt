QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, it is known that the straight lines a and b are intercepted by the straight line c, a parallel b, angle 1 = 50.0, then angle 2 = ()

CHOICES:
A:50째
B:130째
C:40째
D:60째

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the problem description, we know that line a is parallel to line b.
The angle 1 is 50 degrees.
Since a is parallel to b, the corresponding angle to angle 1 is equal to angle 3, where angle 3 and angle 2 are supplementary angles.
Therefore angle 3 = angle 1 = 50 degrees
angle 2 = 180 degrees - angle 3 = 180 degrees - 50 degrees = 130 degrees

Final Answer: B
