QUESTION:
The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What is the average rate of change?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The average rate of change is the slope of the line.

We can use two points on the line to determine the slope.
From the graph, we can see the line passes through (10, 10) and (20, 19).
The slope of the line is:
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
m = (19 - 10) / (20 - 10)
m = 9 / 10
m = 0.9

The average rate of change is $0.9 per minute.
