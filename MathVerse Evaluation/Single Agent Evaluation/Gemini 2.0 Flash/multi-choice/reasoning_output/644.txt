The volume of a cone is given by the formula V = (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cone. In the given problem, the radius is 2 cm and the slant height is 8 cm. We need to find the height of the cone.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have r^2 + h^2 = l^2, where l is the slant height.
So, 2^2 + h^2 = 8^2
4 + h^2 = 64
h^2 = 60
h = sqrt(60) = 2 * sqrt(15) ≈ 7.746 cm

Now, we can find the volume of the cone:
V = (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h
V = (1/3) * pi * (2^2) * 7.746
V = (1/3) * pi * 4 * 7.746
V = (4/3) * pi * 7.746
V ≈ (4/3) * 3.14159 * 7.746
V ≈ 32.436

Rounding to two decimal places, the volume is 32.44 cubic centimeters.
