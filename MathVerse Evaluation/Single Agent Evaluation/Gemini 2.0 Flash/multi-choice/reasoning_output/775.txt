QUESTION:
The perimeter of the rectangle above is p and the area of the rectangle is 36. If l and w are integers, what is one possible value of p?

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem states that the area of the rectangle is 36, and both length (l) and width (w) are integers. We need to find a possible value for the perimeter (p). The area of a rectangle is given by the formula A = l * w, and the perimeter is given by p = 2l + 2w.

Since l and w are integers and the area is 36, we can find the possible integer pairs for (l, w):
(1, 36)
(2, 18)
(3, 12)
(4, 9)
(6, 6)
(9, 4)
(12, 3)
(18, 2)
(36, 1)

Now, let's calculate the perimeter for each pair:
(1, 36): p = 2(1) + 2(36) = 2 + 72 = 74
(2, 18): p = 2(2) + 2(18) = 4 + 36 = 40
(3, 12): p = 2(3) + 2(12) = 6 + 24 = 30
(4, 9): p = 2(4) + 2(9) = 8 + 18 = 26
(6, 6): p = 2(6) + 2(6) = 12 + 12 = 24
(9, 4): p = 2(9) + 2(4) = 18 + 8 = 26
(12, 3): p = 2(12) + 2(3) = 24 + 6 = 30
(18, 2): p = 2(18) + 2(2) = 36 + 4 = 40
(36, 1): p = 2(36) + 2(1) = 72 + 2 = 74

The possible values for the perimeter are 74, 40, 30, 26, and 24.
Since there are no choices provided, a possible value of p is 24.
