QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2). The point at (-5,2) and (3,2) are respectively solid and hollow. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The function's domain is the set of all possible x-values. From the graph, the x-values range from -5 to 3. Since the point at x = -5 is solid, it is included in the domain. Since the point at x = 3 is hollow, it is not included in the domain. Therefore, the domain is [-5, 3).

The range is the set of all possible y-values. From the graph, the y-values range from 0 to 2. The minimum y-value is 0, which is included. The maximum y-value is 2, which is included at x = -5, but not included at x = 3. Since there is a solid dot at (-5,2) the function goes to 2. Therefore, the range is [0, 2].

Domain: [-5, 3)
Range: [0, 2]
