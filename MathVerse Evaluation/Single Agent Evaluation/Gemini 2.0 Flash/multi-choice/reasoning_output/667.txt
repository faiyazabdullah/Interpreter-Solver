GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The area of the circular base of the hemisphere is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the base. In this case, the radius is given as 6.
So, the area of the circular base is:
$A = \pi (6^2) = \pi (36) = 36\pi$

To round to three decimal places, we can use the approximation $\pi \approx 3.14159$.
$A = 36 \times 3.14159 \approx 113.09724$
Rounding to three decimal places, we get $113.097$.

Final Answer: A
