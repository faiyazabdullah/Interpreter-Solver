QUESTION:
The side profile of a bridge is overlapped with the coordinate axes such that $(x, y)$ represents a point on the arc that is $x$ meters horizontally from one end of the bridge and $y$ meters vertically above the road. The bridge meets the road at coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(100,0)$, with the vertex at (50,50).

Pedestrians are able to climb the full arch of the bridge. Find the average steepness of the climb over the interval $[0,20]$.

The bridge is described by a parabola that passes through $(0,0)$ and $(100,0)$, and has its vertex at $(50,50)$. Therefore, the equation of the parabola has the form $y = a(x-50)^2 + 50$. Since the parabola passes through $(0,0)$, we have $0 = a(0-50)^2 + 50$, so $0 = 2500a + 50$, which gives $a = -\frac{50}{2500} = -\frac{1}{50}$. Thus, the equation of the parabola is $y = -\frac{1}{50}(x-50)^2 + 50$.

We are asked to find the average steepness of the climb over the interval $[0,20]$. The average steepness is the average rate of change of the height of the bridge, $y$, with respect to the horizontal distance $x$, over the interval $[0,20]$. This is given by
$$ \frac{y(20) - y(0)}{20 - 0} = \frac{y(20) - y(0)}{20}. $$
We have $y(0) = -\frac{1}{50}(0-50)^2 + 50 = -\frac{1}{50}(2500) + 50 = -50 + 50 = 0$.
Also, $y(20) = -\frac{1}{50}(20-50)^2 + 50 = -\frac{1}{50}(-30)^2 + 50 = -\frac{1}{50}(900) + 50 = -\frac{900}{50} + 50 = -18 + 50 = 32$.
Then the average steepness is $\frac{32 - 0}{20} = \frac{32}{20} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6$.
The point on the graph at $x=20$ appears to be at $y=32$, so this result seems reasonable.
