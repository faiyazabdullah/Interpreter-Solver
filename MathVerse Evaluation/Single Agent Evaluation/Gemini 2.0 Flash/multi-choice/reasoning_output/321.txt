QUESTION:
The figure shows a \parallelogram ABCD, with BD connected, BD perpendicular to AB, and BD also perpendicular to DC. The length of BD is 6m, and the length of AD is 10m. What is the area of \parallelogram ABCD?

CHOICES:
A:24
B:30
C:48
D:60

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The figure is a parallelogram ABCD. BD is perpendicular to AB and DC. BD = 6m, AD = 10m.
Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB = CD, and AD is not perpendicular to AB.
Also, triangles ABD and CDB are right triangles.
In right triangle ABD, AD is the hypotenuse, and AB and BD are the legs.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2
Substituting the given values, we have 10^2 = AB^2 + 6^2
100 = AB^2 + 36
AB^2 = 100 - 36
AB^2 = 64
AB = sqrt(64) = 8 m
The area of parallelogram ABCD is the base times the height.
Taking AB as the base, the height is BD.
Area = AB * BD = 8 * 6 = 48 square meters.
