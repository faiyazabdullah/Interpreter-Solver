QUESTION:
There is a triangle with two acute angles of 27 and 52 degrees, along with an external angle as \angle 1. Find m \angle 1.

CHOICES:
A:21
B:27
C:52
D:79

We are given a triangle with two interior angles measuring 27 degrees and 52 degrees. We need to find the measure of the exterior angle, labeled as angle 1.

The exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Therefore, we can calculate the measure of angle 1 by adding the two given interior angles:

m \angle 1 = 27 + 52 = 79 degrees

Now, we compare our calculated result with the given answer choices:
A: 21
B: 27
C: 52
D: 79

Our calculated value of 79 degrees matches answer choice D.

Final Answer: D
