QUESTION:
A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix with a distance 110x + 53, on to Atlanta with a distance 150x + 91, and back to Des Moines with a distance 73.8x, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.

CHOICES:
A:53
B:73.8
C:110
D:1591

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem states that the total trip distance is 3482 miles. The distances of the trip are given as:
Des Moines to Phoenix: 110x + 53
Phoenix to Atlanta: 150x + 91
Atlanta to Des Moines: 73.8x
So, the sum of these distances is equal to the total trip distance.
(110x + 53) + (150x + 91) + (73.8x) = 3482
Combine like terms:
(110x + 150x + 73.8x) + (53 + 91) = 3482
333.8x + 144 = 3482
Subtract 144 from both sides:
333.8x = 3482 - 144
333.8x = 3338
Divide both sides by 333.8:
x = 3338 / 333.8
x = 10
Now, we need to find the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which is given by the expression 150x + 91.
Substitute x = 10 into the expression:
150(10) + 91 = 1500 + 91 = 1591
So, the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is 1591 miles.

The answer choices are:
A: 53
B: 73.8
C: 110
D: 1591

The calculated distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is 1591 miles, which matches answer choice D.
