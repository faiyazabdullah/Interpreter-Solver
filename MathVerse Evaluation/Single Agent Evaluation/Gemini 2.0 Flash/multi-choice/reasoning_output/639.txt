The concrete pipe can be thought of as a cylinder with a cylindrical hole through the middle. The volume of the concrete is the volume of the outer cylinder minus the volume of the inner cylinder.

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height (or length in this case).

The outer cylinder has radius $r_1 = 7$ m and length $h = 13$ m.  Its volume is
$V_1 = \pi (7^2) (13) = \pi (49)(13) = 637\pi$ cubic meters.

The inner cylinder has radius $r_2 = 3$ m and length $h = 13$ m.  Its volume is
$V_2 = \pi (3^2) (13) = \pi (9)(13) = 117\pi$ cubic meters.

The volume of the concrete pipe is
$V = V_1 - V_2 = 637\pi - 117\pi = 520\pi$ cubic meters.

Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$, the volume is approximately
$V = 520 \times 3.14159 \approx 1633.6268$ cubic meters.
Rounding to two decimal places, the volume is 1633.63 cubic meters.
