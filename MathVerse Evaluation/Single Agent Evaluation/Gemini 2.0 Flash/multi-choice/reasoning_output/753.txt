QUESTION:
In the figure shown above, the rectangular container has length, width and height of 6, 5, and 4, and the cylinder has radius of 3. If all the water in the rectangular container is poured into the cylinder, the water level rises from $h$ inches to $(h+x)$ inches. Which of the following is the best approximation of the value of $x$ ?

CHOICES:
A:3
B:3.4
C:3.8
D:4.2

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The volume of the water in the rectangular container is $6 \times 5 \times 4 = 120$ cubic inches.
The volume of the water in the cylinder is $\pi r^2 x = \pi (3^2) x = 9\pi x$, where $x$ is the increase in height.
We are given that the volume of the water in the rectangular container is poured into the cylinder. Therefore, the volume of water is conserved. So we have:
$9\pi x = 120$
$x = \frac{120}{9\pi} = \frac{40}{3\pi} \approx \frac{40}{3 \times 3.14} = \frac{40}{9.42} \approx 4.246$
The best approximation of the value of $x$ is 4.2.
