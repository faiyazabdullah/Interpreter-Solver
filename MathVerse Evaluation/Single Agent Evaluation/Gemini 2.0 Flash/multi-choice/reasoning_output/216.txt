The problem states that the triangles DFE and ACB are right triangles. Also, angle D is congruent to angle A. Since both triangles have a right angle, and one other corresponding angle is congruent, the triangles are similar by AA similarity.
Therefore, since triangle DFE is similar to triangle ACB, we have the proportion
DF/AC = FE/CB = DE/AB
We are given FE = 3, AC = 45, and CB = 15. We want to find DE.
From FE/CB = DE/AB, we have 3/15 = DE/AB
From DF/AC = FE/CB, we have DF/45 = 3/15.
From this we can find DF = 45*3/15 = 9.
From the proportion FE/CB = DF/AC = DE/AB, we have
3/15 = DF/45 = DE/AB
Therefore 3/15 = 1/5. Thus DF/45 = 1/5 which means DF = 9.
In triangle ABC, the sides are 15 and 45, so the ratio of the sides is 1:3.
Since angle D equals angle A, we have:
FE/CB = DE/AB
3/15 = DE/AB
1/5 = DE/AB
AC/DF = CB/FE = AB/DE
45/DF = 15/3 = AB/DE
15/3 = 5
Thus 45/DF = 5
Thus DF = 9
Now we have a right triangle DFE where one side is 3 and the other is 9.
We have the right triangle ACB where one side is 15 and the other is 45.
Since the two triangles are similar, we have that:
FE/CB = DF/AC = DE/AB
3/15 = 9/45 = DE/AB
1/5 = 1/5 = DE/AB
AB = sqrt(15^2 + 45^2)
AB = sqrt(225 + 2025)
AB = sqrt(2250)
AB = 15*sqrt(10)
So 1/5 = DE/(15*sqrt(10))
DE = 3*sqrt(10)
Something is wrong.
Since the triangles are similar we have that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal
FE/CB = DF/AC = DE/AB
3/15 = DF/45
1/5 = DF/45
DF = 45/5 = 9
Using Pythagorean theorem on triangle ABC, AB = sqrt(45^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(2025 + 225) = sqrt(2250) = 15*sqrt(10)
Using Pythagorean theorem on triangle DEF, DE = sqrt(3^2 + 9^2) = sqrt(9+81) = sqrt(90) = 3*sqrt(10)
We want to find DE
FE/CB = DE/AB
3/15 = DE/(15*sqrt(10))
DE = (3/15)*15*sqrt(10)
DE = 3*sqrt(10) which is approximately 9.4868.

However, since angle A is congruent to angle D,
CB/FE = AC/DF = AB/DE
Since CB/FE = 15/3 = 5
And AC/DF = 45/DF
So 5 = 45/DF
DF = 9
And AB/DE = 5
AB = sqrt(AC^2 + BC^2) = sqrt(45^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(2025 + 225) = sqrt(2250) = 15sqrt(10)
so AB/DE = 5
15sqrt(10)/DE = 5
DE = 3sqrt(10) ≈ 9.486

Since the triangles are similar then the sides are proportional. We are given that angle D = angle A
FE/CB = DF/AC
3/15 = DF/45
DF = 45 * 3 / 15
DF = 9

Using the Pythagorean Theorem: DE = sqrt(DF^2 + FE^2)
DE = sqrt(9^2 + 3^2)
DE = sqrt(81 + 9)
DE = sqrt(90)
DE ≈ 9.48

The length of DE is closest to choice D.
