Let the angle between the folded part and the horizontal line be x. Since angle 1 is 140 degrees, the supplementary angle to angle 1 is 180 - 140 = 40 degrees.
The angle between the folded part and the horizontal line is therefore 40 degrees.
After folding, the angle remains the same, so the angle between the unfolded part and the horizontal line is also 40 degrees.
Angle 2 and the 40 degree angle are supplementary, which means their sum is 180 degrees.
Thus, angle 2 = 180 - 40 = 140 degrees.
However, this doesn't match the answer choices. Let's analyze this problem using a different approach.

Since the width of the paper is the same, the two angles where the paper is folded are equal. Let's call that angle x.
The angle given is 140 degrees. The angle between the paper and the horizontal line is (180 - 140) = 40 degrees.
When the paper is folded, the angle that's folded is 40 degrees. The fold makes the angle to be 40 degrees on the other side too.
The angle formed where the fold happens is 180 - 2 * 40 = 180 - 80 = 100 degrees.
The angle formed on the other side where the paper folds is the same angle, so that's also 100 degrees.
Angle 2 is the external angle of the triangle with angles 40, 40 and 100. Therefore, angle 2 is 180 - 40 = 140 degrees.

Consider the angles formed at the fold. Let the angle between the edge of the paper and the fold line be $x$.
Then, the other side also has the same angle $x$.
So, $180 - 140 = 40$. This is the angle between the paper edge and horizontal.
Therefore, $x = 40$ degrees. Then the internal angle is 100.

So the angle next to angle 2 is also 40.
Then angle 2 + 40 = 180. So angle 2 = 140. But this answer is not in the options.
Let's consider a different relationship.

Let's say the angle created by folding is $\theta$. Then $140 = 180 - (90 - \theta/2)$.
Let's say the angle between the fold and the vertical is x.
The acute angle between the edge and the line is (180-140) = 40.
So we have a right angle. Angle 2 is what we need to find.
The two angles where it folds are the same. Say the angles are x.
So angle 1 = (180 - x)/2 + 90 + (180 - x)/2. 
140 = 90 + x.
x = 50. 
So 2x + angle 2 = 360
100 + angle 2 = 360.
Angle 2 = 260

However, the geometry tells us that angle 1 and angle 2 add up to more than 180 degrees.
180 - 140 = 40
So the angle with the horizontal line is 40.
Then angle 2 is 140. This isn't right.
angle 2 = 360 - 240
