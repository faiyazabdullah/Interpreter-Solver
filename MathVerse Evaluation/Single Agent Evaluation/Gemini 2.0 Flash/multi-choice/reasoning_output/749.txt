GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The length of AG can be found by applying the Pythagorean theorem twice. First, consider the right triangle AFG. The length of AF is 5 and the length of FG is 4.
Then $AG^2 = AF^2 + FG^2$
$AG^2 = 5^2 + 4^2$
$AG^2 = 25 + 16 = 41$
Consider the right triangle AFG. The length of AF is 5 and the length of FG is 4. Thus $AG = \sqrt{FG^2+AF^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{16+25} = \sqrt{41}$.
No other calculations are necessary since the question asks for the length of AG.
