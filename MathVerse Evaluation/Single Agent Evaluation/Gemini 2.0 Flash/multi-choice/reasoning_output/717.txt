The image shows a square pyramid.
The height of the pyramid is given as 6 cm.
The length of the base is given as 10 cm.
We are asked to find the volume of the square pyramid.

The formula for the volume of a pyramid is given by:
Volume = (1/3) * Base Area * Height
Since the base is a square, the area of the base is side * side = side^2.
In this case, the side of the square base is 10 cm.
So, the base area = 10 cm * 10 cm = 100 cm^2.
The height of the pyramid is 6 cm.
Volume = (1/3) * 100 cm^2 * 6 cm
Volume = (1/3) * 600 cm^3
Volume = 200 cm^3
