QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, a square DEFG model should be cut on a piece of triangle ABC paper. Among them, G and F are on BC, D and E are on AB and AC respectively, AH perpendicular  BC and it intersects DE at M, if BC = 12.0, AH = 8.0, then the edge length of the square DEFG is ()

CHOICES:
A:\frac{24}{5}cm
B:4cm
C:\frac{24}{7}cm
D:5cm

====================================================================================================
Let the side length of the square DEFG be x. Since DEFG is a square, DE = DG = GF = FE = x.
Also, since AH is perpendicular to BC, and DE is parallel to BC, AM is perpendicular to DE. Thus, AM = AH - MH = AH - DE = 8 - x.
Since DE is parallel to BC, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC.
Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal.
AM/AH = DE/BC
(8-x)/8 = x/12
12(8-x) = 8x
96 - 12x = 8x
96 = 20x
x = 96/20
x = 24/5
