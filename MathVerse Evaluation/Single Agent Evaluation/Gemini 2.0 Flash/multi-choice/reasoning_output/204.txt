QUESTION:
Two triangles X N M and X Z Y are similar with a shared vertex X. M N and Y Z are parallel. If X N = 6, X M = 2, and X Y = 10, find N Z.

CHOICES:
A:12
B:16
C:24
D:32

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
We are given that triangle XNM is similar to triangle XZY.
We are given that XN = 6, XM = 2, and XY = 10.
We need to find NZ.
Since triangle XNM is similar to triangle XZY, we have the proportion:
XN / XZ = XM / XY
6 / XZ = 2 / 10
2 * XZ = 6 * 10
2 * XZ = 60
XZ = 60 / 2
XZ = 30
We are given that XN = 6 and we found that XZ = 30.
Since NZ = XZ - XN, we have:
NZ = 30 - 6
NZ = 24
