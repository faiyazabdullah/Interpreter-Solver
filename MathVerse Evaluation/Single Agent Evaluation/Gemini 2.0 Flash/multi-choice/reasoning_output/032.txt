The circle I is the inscribed circle of triangle ABC, and D, E, F are the tangent points. We are given that ∠DEF = 52°. We want to find the measure of ∠A.

Since D, E, and F are the tangent points, ID ⊥ AB, IE ⊥ BC, and IF ⊥ AC.
Let ∠A = x. Then ∠B + ∠C = 180° - x.
Since I is the incenter of triangle ABC,
∠DIE = 180° - ∠B/2 - ∠B/2 = 180° - ∠B. Similarly, ∠EIF = 180° - ∠C, and ∠FID = 180° - ∠A.

The angles of triangle DEF sum to 180°. We are given ∠DEF = 52°.
∠EDF = 180° - ∠IEF - ∠IDE = 180° - (90° - ∠C/2) - (90° - ∠B/2)
∠DFE = 180° - ∠IFD - ∠IFE = 180° - (90° - ∠A/2) - (90° - ∠C/2)
∠DEF = 180° - ∠IDE - ∠IFE = 180° - (90° - ∠B/2) - (90° - ∠A/2)

So, ∠DEF = ∠IDE + ∠IFE = 52°. Since ID ⊥ AB and IE ⊥ BC, quadrilateral BDI is a rectangle, and quadrilateral BDEI has angles adding up to 360°.
We have ∠IDB = 90° and ∠IEB = 90°. Therefore, ∠B + ∠DIE = 180°.
∠A + ∠B + ∠C = 180°. We also have that ∠DEF = 52°.

In triangle DEF,
∠EDF + ∠DFE + ∠DEF = 180°.
∠EDF + ∠DFE + 52° = 180°
∠EDF + ∠DFE = 128°

We have ∠EDF = 90 - A/2, ∠DFE = 90 - B/2 and ∠DEF = 90 - C/2.
So the angles A,B,C become 180 - (A/2 + B/2 + C/2)
This means that DEF = 90 - A/2 + 90 - B/2 + 90 - C/2 = 180.
So 90 - ∠A/2 = 52°

We can find the measure of angle A by considering that ∠DEF = 90° - $\frac{1}{2}$∠A.
52 = 90 - A/2
A/2 = 90 - 52
A/2 = 38
A = 2 * 38
A = 76°

Final Answer: C
