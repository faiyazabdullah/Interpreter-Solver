In the given right-angled triangle, we have an angle of 30 degrees, the adjacent side to the angle is 8.5, and the hypotenuse is P. We can use the cosine function to relate these quantities:

cos(30°) = adjacent / hypotenuse
cos(30°) = 8.5 / P

We know that cos(30°) = √3 / 2.  Therefore,

√3 / 2 = 8.5 / P

To solve for P, we can rearrange the equation:

P = 8.5 / (√3 / 2)
P = 8.5 * (2 / √3)
P = 17 / √3

Now, we can rationalize the denominator:

P = (17 * √3) / (√3 * √3)
P = (17 * √3) / 3

Approximating √3 ≈ 1.732, we have:

P ≈ (17 * 1.732) / 3
P ≈ 29.444 / 3
P ≈ 9.814666...

We can also use the sine function with respect to the 60 degree angle.

sin(60) = P / 8.5. Therefore
P = 8.5 / sin(60)

With respect to the 30 degree angle, we know the opposite side is $x$

tan(30) = x / 8.5
x = 8.5 tan(30)
x = 8.5 (1 / sqrt(3))

P^2 = 8.5^2 + x^2 = 8.5^2 + (8.5 / sqrt(3))^2
P = sqrt(8.5^2 + (8.5 / sqrt(3))^2 ) = sqrt(72.25 + 72.25 / 3)
P = sqrt( 72.25 * (1 + 1/3)) = sqrt( 72.25 * 4/3 )
P = sqrt(96.333) = 9.815

There are no answer choices to compare to.
