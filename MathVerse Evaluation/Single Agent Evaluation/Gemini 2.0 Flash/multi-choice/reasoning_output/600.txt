QUESTION:
A rectangle is inscribed between the $x$-axis and the parabola $y=36-x^2$ with one side along the $x$-axis, as shown in the figure below. Let $x$ denote the $x$-coordinate of the point highlighted in the figure. Write the area $A$ of the rectangle as a function of $x$.

Let the coordinates of the point highlighted in the figure be $(x,0)$. Since the rectangle is symmetric about the $y$-axis, the $x$-coordinate of the other vertex on the $x$-axis will be $(-x,0)$. Therefore, the width of the rectangle is $x - (-x) = 2x$.
The height of the rectangle is given by the $y$-coordinate of the point on the parabola corresponding to the $x$-coordinate. Since the equation of the parabola is $y=36-x^2$, the height of the rectangle is $36-x^2$.
The area of the rectangle is given by the product of the width and the height. Therefore, the area $A$ of the rectangle as a function of $x$ is:
$$A(x) = (2x)(36-x^2) = 72x - 2x^3$$
