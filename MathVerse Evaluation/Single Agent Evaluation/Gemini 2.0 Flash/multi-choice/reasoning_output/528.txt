QUESTION:
Points $A, B$, and $C$ are plotted on the unit circle and also on the x-axis and y-axis. Which of the coordinates is equal to $\cos (\pi)$ ?

CHOICES:
A:$x$-coordinate of point $A$
B:$y$-coordinate of point $A$
C:$x$-coordinate of point $B$
D:$y$-coordinate of point $B$
E:$x$-coordinate of point $C$
F:$y$-coordinate of point $C$

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The unit circle is a circle with a radius of 1, centered at the origin (0,0).
Point $A$ is on the unit circle at the intersection with the positive x-axis, so its coordinates are (1, 0).
Point $B$ is on the unit circle at the intersection with the positive y-axis, so its coordinates are (0, 1).
Point $C$ is on the unit circle at the intersection with the negative x-axis, so its coordinates are (-1, 0).

The cosine of an angle $\theta$ is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle that corresponds to the angle $\theta$.

The angle $\pi$ radians is 180 degrees. On the unit circle, the point corresponding to $\pi$ radians is the point at the intersection of the circle and the negative x-axis, which is point $C$. The coordinates of point $C$ are $(-1, 0)$.
Thus, $\cos(\pi) = -1$.

$x$-coordinate of point $A$ is 1.
$y$-coordinate of point $A$ is 0.
$x$-coordinate of point $B$ is 0.
$y$-coordinate of point $B$ is 1.
$x$-coordinate of point $C$ is -1.
$y$-coordinate of point $C$ is 0.

Since $\cos(\pi) = -1$, the $x$-coordinate of point $C$ is $\cos(\pi)$.

Final Answer: E
