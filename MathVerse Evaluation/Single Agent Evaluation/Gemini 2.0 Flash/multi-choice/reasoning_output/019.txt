Let's denote the angle supplementary to $\angle 1$ as $\angle 5$. Then $\angle 5 = 180^\circ - \angle 1 = 180^\circ - 158^\circ = 22^\circ$.
Let's denote the angle supplementary to $\angle 4$ as $\angle 6$. Then $\angle 6 = 180^\circ - \angle 4 = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ$.

Since $a \parallel b$, let's consider a line parallel to both $a$ and $b$ that passes through the vertex of $\angle 2$ and $\angle 3$. Let's call the points on this line $A$ and $B$, with $A$ on the side of $a$ and $B$ on the side of $b$.

Then, the angle between the ray forming $\angle 5$ and line $AB$ is equal to $\angle 5 = 22^\circ$. Let this angle be $\angle 7$.
Also, the angle between the ray forming $\angle 6$ and line $AB$ is equal to $\angle 8 = 180^\circ - \angle 6 = 50^\circ$.

Let the angle between the ray forming $\angle 2$ and line $AB$ be $\angle 9$. Then $\angle 9 = \angle 2 = 42^\circ$.
Similarly, let the angle between the ray forming $\angle 3$ and line $AB$ be $\angle 10$. Then $\angle 3 + \angle 10 = \angle 6 = 130^\circ$, so $\angle 10 = 130^\circ - \angle 3$.
We also have $\angle 7 + \angle 2 + \angle 3 + \angle 8 = 180^\circ$, which means $22^\circ + 42^\circ + \angle 3 = x$, where x can be considered.
However, by extending the lines in the diagram, let the line at $\angle 1$ intersect the line at $\angle 4$.
Consider $\angle 1 = 158^\circ$ and $\angle 2 = 42^\circ$. The alternate interior angle to $\angle 1$ is $180 - 158 = 22$. Let $x$ be the angle between lines $a$ and $b$.
So $22 + 42 = x$. Therefore $x = 64^\circ$. So the remaining angle on line $b$ is $180-64 = 116$.
$50 + 116 + \angle 3 = 180$,
Let the angle between $158^{\circ}$ and the extension of line $a$ be $22$. Also, since the lines are parallel, the co-interior angle is $180 -50 = 130$. Also $\angle 2$ = 42
Let the required angle be $x$. Then since the lines are parallel, the adjacent cointerior angles = 180. Since,
$a$ is parallel to $b$, the sum of the angles formed is 180. Let the angle next to $\angle 1$ be $\alpha = 180 - 158 = 22$. Also, let the angle next to $\angle 4$ be $\beta = 180-50=130$.
So $\alpha + \angle 2 + \angle 3 = 180$ (If we assume the lines a and b intersect). But this is wrong.
Also $\beta = \angle 3$. No, wrong again.

We know that the sum of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is 180.
$158 + \theta = 180$, where $\theta = 22$.
Let $22 + 42 + \angle 3 + 50 = 180+ X$.

Consider the exterior angles $158$, $50$. Then the interior angles are $22$ and $130$. $22+42 + x= 130$.
So $x = 130-64 = 66 \approx 70$.
If $\angle 3 = 80^{\circ}$, $50 + 80 = 130 + 42 + angle = 180^{\circ}$
Using a straight edge. $angle 3$ is approximately 70.
