Let the dimensions of the box be $l=25$, $w=20$, and $h=33$.
The surface area of a rectangular box is $2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(25(20) + 25(33) + 20(33)) = 2(500 + 825 + 660) = 2(1985) = 3970$.
Since there are two boxes, the total surface area is $2(3970) = 7940$.
The cylinder has radius $r=6$ and height $h=11$.
The surface area of the cylinder is $2\pi r^2 + 2\pi r h = 2\pi (6^2) + 2\pi (6)(11) = 72\pi + 132\pi = 204\pi$.
The area of the two circles removed from each box is $2 \pi r^2 = 2\pi (6^2) = 72\pi$. Since there are two boxes, the total removed area is $2(72\pi) = 144\pi$.

The surface area of the solid is the surface area of the two boxes minus the area of the circles that are removed plus the surface area of the cylinder.
The surface area of two boxes is $2(25 \times 20 + 25 \times 33 + 20 \times 33) = 2(500 + 825 + 660) = 2(1985) = 3970$.  So, $2(3970) = 7940$.
We have to subtract the area of the two circles, $2\pi r^2$, from each box. So, $2(2\pi (6^2)) = 4\pi(36) = 144\pi$.
The area of the cylinder connecting the boxes is $2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2$, where $r = 6$ and $h = 11$. So the area of the cylinder is $2\pi(6)(11) + 2\pi(6^2) = 132\pi + 72\pi = 204\pi$.
Total surface area = $7940 - 144\pi + 204\pi = 7940 + 60\pi = 7940 + 60(3.14159) = 7940 + 188.4954 \approx 8128.50$

We have to remove the circles with area $\pi r^2$ from the boxes. In each box, we remove a circle of area $\pi r^2$. Since there are two boxes, we remove $2 \pi r^2 = 2 \pi (6^2) = 72\pi$ from the surface area of the boxes. The surface area of the cylinder is $2\pi rh + 2 \pi r^2 = 2\pi (6)(11) + 2\pi (6^2) = 132\pi + 72\pi = 204\pi$. The total surface area of the two boxes is $2(2(lw + lh + wh)) = 4(lw + lh + wh) = 4(500 + 825 + 660) = 4(1985) = 7940$. So we subtract $2(36\pi)$ from the surface area. The surface area of the cylinder is $2\pi rh + 2 \pi r^2$. $2 \pi r^2 = 2 \pi (6)^2 = 2\pi(36) = 72\pi$. And the surface area of the wall is $2 \pi rh = 2 \pi (6)(11) = 132 \pi$. So the surface area is $7940 - 2(36 \pi) + 2 \pi (6)(11) = 7940 - 72\pi + 132\pi = 7940 + 60\pi = 7940 + 60(3.14159) = 7940 + 188.4954 \approx 8128.5$.
We have the surface area of the two boxes minus two circles plus surface area of cylinder walls:
$2(25*20 + 25*33 + 20*33) - 2\pi*6^2 + 2\pi*6*11$
$= 7940 - 72\pi + 132\pi$
$= 7940 + 60\pi$
$= 7940 + 60(3.14)$
$= 7940 + 188.4 \approx 8128.4$.
