QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, AB is a fixed climbing ladder leaning on the wall, the distance from the foot of the ladder B to the foot of the wall C is 1.6, the distance from the point D on the ladder to the wall is 1.4, and the length of the ladder is 0.5, then the length of the ladder is ()

CHOICES:
A:3.5m
B:4m
C:4.5m
D:5m

From the question, we know DE⊥BC and AC⊥BC, so DE∥AC. Thus, △BDE∽△BAC.
Then BD/BA = BE/BC, i.e., 0.5/BA = 1.4/1.6.
So BA = (0.5 × 1.6)/1.4 = 8/14 = 4/7.
Therefore, the length of the ladder AB is (0.5*1.6)/1.4=4/7. No.

Since DE∥AC, △BDE∽△BAC
Therefore, BD/BA = BE/BC, so 0.5/AB = 1.4/1.6
Then AB = (0.5*1.6)/1.4 = 0.8/1.4 = 8/14 = 4/7 (This doesn't make sense.)

The problem states "the length of the ladder is 0.5", where I think it should be "the distance from the point D on the ladder to the ground is 0.5".
If BE=0.5, DE=1.4, BC=1.6, we have DE∥AC, then △BDE∽△BAC, so BE/BC = BD/BA, that is 0.5/1.6 = BD/AB
We need to find AB.
If BD=0.5, BE=1.4, then 0.5/AB=1.4/1.6, so AB = (0.5*1.6)/1.4 = 0.8/1.4 = 4/7
Still not making sense.

Based on the image, DE = 1.4, BE = 0.5, BC = 1.6.
Since DE // AC, we have △BDE ~ △BAC.
So, BD/BA = BE/BC, therefore BD/BA = 0.5/1.6 = 5/16
Thus BA = (16/5) BD

But if BD=1.4, then BA>1.4, so this is wrong
If BD = 0.5, this is wrong.

DE ⊥ BC, AC ⊥ BC, so DE // AC. Therefore, △BDE ∼ △BAC.
Thus, BD/BA = BE/BC, where BE = 0.5, BC = 1.6, and DE=1.4.
We need to find BA.
0.  5/1.6 = BD/BA. If we knew BD, we could find BA.
The question does not have enough data to solve it.

The information in the question is confusing. I assume that the question means the distance from the point D on the ladder to the ground is 0.5, DE = 0.5, BE=1.4, BC = 1.6.
Then the solution is BD/AB = BE/BC, then BD/AB = 1.4/1.6 = 7/8.
AB = (8/7)BD, still can not be solved.

Assume BD = 0.5, BE=1.4
DE/AC = BE/BC, 1.4/AC = 0.5/1.6
AC = (1.4*1.6)/0.5 = 1.4*3.2 = 4.48
Then AB^2 = AC^2+BC^2, AB^2 = 4.48^2 + 1.6^2, AB^2 = 20.07+2.56 = 22.63
AB=4.75. Which is approximately 4.5m.
