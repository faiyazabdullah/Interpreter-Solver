QUESTION:
The final approach of an aeroplane when landing requires the pilot to adjust their angle of descent to about 3°. If the plane is 12 metres above the runway and has d metres until touchdown, find d to the nearest metre.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem can be solved using trigonometry. The angle of descent is 3 degrees, the height above the runway is 12 metres, and the horizontal distance to touchdown is d metres.

We have a right triangle where the opposite side is 12 m and the adjacent side is d m.
The tangent of the angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
Therefore, tan(3°) = 12 / d
d = 12 / tan(3°)
Using a calculator, tan(3°) ≈ 0.0524
d ≈ 12 / 0.0524
d ≈ 229.0076
To the nearest metre, d ≈ 229 m
