The base of the pyramid is a square with side 10mm.
The area of the base is 10mm * 10mm = 100 mm^2.

The perpendicular height of the pyramid is 8mm.
To find the surface area of each triangular face, we need to find the slant height.
The slant height is the height of each triangular face.
We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height.
The slant height, s, is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being the perpendicular height (8mm) and the other leg being half the length of the base (10mm / 2 = 5mm).
s^2 = 8^2 + 5^2
s^2 = 64 + 25
s^2 = 89
s = sqrt(89)
s â‰ˆ 9.43 mm

The area of each triangular face is (1/2) * base * height, where the base is the side of the square (10mm) and the height is the slant height (9.43mm).
Area of one triangular face = (1/2) * 10mm * 9.43mm
Area of one triangular face = 5mm * 9.43mm
Area of one triangular face = 47.15 mm^2

Since the pyramid has four triangular faces, the total area of the triangular faces is 4 * 47.15 mm^2 = 188.6 mm^2.

The total surface area of the pyramid is the sum of the area of the base and the area of the four triangular faces.
Total surface area = 100 mm^2 + 188.6 mm^2 = 288.6 mm^2

Rounded to two decimal places, the surface area is 288.60 mm^2.
