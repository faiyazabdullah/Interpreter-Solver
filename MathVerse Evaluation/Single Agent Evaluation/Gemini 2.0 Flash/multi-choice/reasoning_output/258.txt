The angles around point C must sum to 360 degrees. Therefore:
(x - 1) + (3x + 5) + 60 + m \angle N C L = 360
We need to find m \angle N C L. First, let's find the value of x.

The angle \angle LCN is the remainder of the 360 degrees circle minus the sum of (x - 1), (3x + 5), and 60. However we can rearrange the equation and it will be simpler.
The circle is composed of the angles (x - 1), (3x + 5), 60, and angle NCL. We also know the whole circle is 360 degrees, thus:
(x - 1) + (3x + 5) + 60 + m \angle N C L = 360
But, we want to isolate the m \angle N C L so we cannot solve for a value of x from what is provided.
However, the diagram may be misleading, but if we assume that L, C, and M are on a straight line, then m \angle LCM = 180, which means
m \angle MCL = (3x + 5) + 60 = 180
So now, we can solve for x:
3x + 65 = 180
3x = 115
x = 115/3

Then, (x - 1) = (115/3) - 1 = 112/3.
Then, \angle RCM = 112/3 degrees.
Also, \angle RCL = 3x + 5 = 3(115/3) + 5 = 115 + 5 = 120.
\angle MCN = 60.
Then, if we want to find \angle NCL, since \angle MCL is a straight line, equal to 180, \angle MCN is 60. Thus \angle NCL is 180-60 = 120.
(112/3) + 120 + 60 + m\angle NCL = 360
(112/3) + 180 + m\angle NCL = 360
m\angle NCL = 180 - (112/3) = (540 - 112) / 3 = 428/3 which doesn't match with the choices.

Let's reconsider the question. We are given that \angle RCM = x-1, \angle RCL = 3x + 5, \angle MCN = 60, and we are looking for \angle NCL.
If we make the assumption that R,C, and L are not necessarily on a straight line, the question still may be valid.
Assume \angle RCL and \angle RCM are the only parts to the angles about Point C, that compose a line with point M. Then, \angle RCM + \angle RCL = 180 (linear angle). Therefore, (x-1)+(3x+5) = 180, so 4x + 4 = 180, so 4x = 176, thus x = 44.
We know, \angle RCL = 3x + 5 = 3(44) + 5 = 132 + 5 = 137.
We are given \angle MCN = 60.
We want to find \angle NCL = A.
Then the circle is \angle RCM + \angle RCL + \angle MCN + \angle NCL = 360
(x-1) + (3x+5) + 60 + A = 360
4x + 4 + 60 + A = 360
4(44) + 64 + A = 360
176 + 64 + A = 360
240 + A = 360
A = 360 - 240 = 120
\angle NCL = 120 degrees
