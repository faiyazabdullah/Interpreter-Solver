The center of the ellipse is at $x = \frac{-0.5 + (-3.5)}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$.
The center is also at $y = 2$, so the center is at $(-2, 2)$.
The semi-major axis is $a = \frac{-0.5 - (-3.5)}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$.
The semi-minor axis is $b$, and we can find it from the graph by observing the values along the y-axis which is approximately 3.
The ellipse is centered at $(-2, 2)$.
The equation of an ellipse centered at $(h, k)$ is $\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$.
In this case, we have $h = -2$ and $k = 2$. Also, $a = 1.5$.
Since the ellipse's major axis is vertical, we can assume $b$ is approximately $5 - 2 = 3$.
Then the equation of the ellipse is $\frac{(x+2)^2}{1.5^2} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{3^2} = 1$, so $\frac{(x+2)^2}{2.25} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{9} = 1$.

However, we observe from the graph that the major axis is actually along the y-axis.
The center is at $(-2, 2)$. The length of the semi-major axis along the y-axis is approximately $5 - 2 = 3$.
The length of the semi-minor axis along the x-axis is approximately $-0.5 - (-2) = 1.5$.
The equation of the ellipse centered at $(-2, 2)$ is $\frac{(x+2)^2}{1.5^2} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{3^2} = 1$, which is $\frac{(x+2)^2}{2.25} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{9} = 1$.

The x intercepts are given as -0.5 and -3.5, thus $a = \frac{|-0.5 - (-3.5)|}{2} = 1.5$. The y intercept is approximately 2, however the distance along y axis from the center (-2,2) is approximately 3. The graph of the ellipse would have to be written as $\frac{(x+2)^2}{1.5^2} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{3^2} = 1$.
