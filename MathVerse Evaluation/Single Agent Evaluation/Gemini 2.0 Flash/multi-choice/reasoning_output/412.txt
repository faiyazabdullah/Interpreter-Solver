QUESTION:
This is part of a piece of jewellery. It is made out of a metal plate base, and gold plated wire (of negligible thickness) runs around the outside.

What is the area covered by the metal plate base?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a figure composed of two large sectors and a small circle. The radius of the large sectors is 6 mm, and the radius of the small circle is 3 mm. The angle of each sector is 90 degrees.
The area of a full circle with radius r is $\pi r^2$.
The area of a sector with radius r and angle $\theta$ (in degrees) is $\frac{\theta}{360} \pi r^2$.
The area of the full circle with radius 3 mm is $\pi (3^2) = 9\pi$ mm$^2$. Since the figure is missing a quarter of the circle, the area of the cutout is $\frac{1}{4} \pi (3^2) = \frac{9\pi}{4}$ mm$^2$.
The area of each sector with radius 6 mm and angle 90 degrees is $\frac{90}{360} \pi (6^2) = \frac{1}{4} \pi (36) = 9\pi$ mm$^2$.
The area of the two sectors is $2 \times 9\pi = 18\pi$ mm$^2$.
The area of the metal plate is the area of the two sectors minus the area of the quarter circle.
Area $= 18\pi - \frac{9\pi}{4} = \frac{72\pi}{4} - \frac{9\pi}{4} = \frac{63\pi}{4} = 15.75\pi$.
Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we have Area $= 15.75 \times 3.14159 \approx 49.4800 \approx 49.48$ mm$^2$.
