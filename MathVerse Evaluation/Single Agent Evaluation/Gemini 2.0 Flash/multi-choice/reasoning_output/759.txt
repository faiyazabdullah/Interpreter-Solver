QUESTION:
In the figure above, three lines intersect at a point. The graph consists of the intersection of three lines, two of the angles are y°, and one of the angles is 50°. What is the value of y?

B.70
C.75
D.80
E.85

The three lines intersect at a point. The sum of angles around a point is 360°.
In the figure, we can see that the angle opposite to the angle marked as 50° is also 50°.
Also, the angle opposite to the angle marked as y° is also y°.
The sum of angles around a point is 360°, so we have:
y° + y° + 50° + 50° + x + x = 360°

where x represents each of the other two missing angles between the 50° and y° angles

We also know that angles on a straight line sum up to 180°.
So, y° + y° + 50° = 180°
y° + (straight line with the 50) = 180
so, x + 50 + y = 180
y + 50 + y + 50 = 180

The angles around a point sum to 360 degrees,
y + y + vertical angle to 50 (which is 50) + 2 unlabeled verticle angles = 360
But we know that on one of the straight lines, y + something = 180
y + 50 + x = 180

We know one pair of opposite angles is $50^\circ$. Therefore, there's another $50^\circ$ angle. The remaining angles must then add up to $360^\circ - 2 \cdot 50^\circ = 360^\circ - 100^\circ = 260^\circ$.
Two of these angles are $y^\circ$ so we have $2y + z + z = 360$.
Furthermore, $y + z = 180 - 50 = 130$
So, $y = 130$
We also know that the angles next to 50 form a straight line.
50 + y + x = 180, where x is the adjacent angle.
x=180 -50 - y
Also y + y + 50+50 + x+x = 360
2y+100 + 2x =360
2y +2x = 260
y +x = 130
x = 130-y
50 + 2y = 180
2y= 130
y= 65
