QUESTION:
In the figure above, the length of CD is 7, the length of CF is 15, and CDEF is a rectangle. If the area of triangle CAF is equal to the area of rectangle CDEF, what is the length of segment AD?

CHOICES:
A.7/2
B.5
C.7
D.15/2
E.15

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let AD = x. Then AC = AD + DC = x + 7.
The area of triangle CAF is (1/2) * CF * AC = (1/2) * 15 * (x + 7).
The area of rectangle CDEF is CD * CF = 7 * 15 = 105.
The problem states that the area of triangle CAF is equal to the area of rectangle CDEF.
Therefore, (1/2) * 15 * (x + 7) = 105.
Multiply both sides by 2:
15 * (x + 7) = 210
Divide both sides by 15:
x + 7 = 14
Subtract 7 from both sides:
x = 14 - 7
x = 7
AD = 7

Final Answer: C
