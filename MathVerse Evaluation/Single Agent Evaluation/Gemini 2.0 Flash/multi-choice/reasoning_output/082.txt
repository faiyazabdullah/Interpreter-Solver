According to the question, line l is parallel to line m, and line m is parallel to line n. Therefore, line l is parallel to line n. The angle between BC and line n is 25 degrees, so the angle between BC and line m is also 25 degrees. In triangle ABC, angle ACB is 60 degrees, and angle ABC is 25 degrees. Therefore, angle BAC = 180 - 60 - 25 = 95 degrees. Since line l is parallel to line n, the angle between AC and line l is equal to the angle between AC and line m which equals 60. Then alpha = 180-95-60 = 25.0.
Since line l is parallel to line n. Then alpha=angle ABC-angle ACB=180-60-25=95. Because l parallel to m parallel to n. Then the angle of BC with m=25.
angle ACB=60. Therefore, angle BAC = 180 - 60 - 25=95. Alpha=180-95-60=25. The angle between AC and line l is Alpha+angle ACB=35+25
Because AB intersects l. angle Alpha is the interior angle of triangle ABC. We could derive angle Alpha.
The angle is 180-95= 35.0 degree. The angle formed by line AC to the left of line m is 60 degrees (given)
Since l || m || n, the angle between line BC and line m is 25 degrees.

Thus, in triangle ABC, angle ABC = 25 degrees. angle ACB = 60 degrees
Then angle BAC = 180 - (25+60) = 95 degrees.

Since l || m, the angle between AC and l is equal to the angle between AC and m
Which is 60 degrees.

We are trying to find alpha. Alpha + angle BAC = 180 degrees,  is incorrect, look at the figure.
Looking back at the diagram we can see alpha + internal angle CAB = 95.
The angle inside the triangle formed by the horizontal line is 180-60= 120 degrees. So alpha=180-120-25=35.0.
Let's look at it again,
The angle alpha is next to vertex A. l || m || n. the angle between BC and n is 25 degrees, so angle ABC=25 degrees.
angle ACB = 60 degrees. In triangle ABC, 180 - 25 - 60 = 95 degrees. angle CAB= 95 degrees.
Let the point intersect between line L and line AC be D.
So, angle CAD = alpha. We want to find what alpha is. l || m, angle between m and AC is 60.

alpha + 60+ ABC = 180, NO
