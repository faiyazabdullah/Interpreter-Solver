QUESTION:
A polynomial p is graphed, which goes through (-3.5,0), (0,0), (3,0). What could be the equation of p?

CHOICES:
A:p(x)=x(x-3)^2(2 x+7)
B:p(x)=x^2(x-3)(2 x+7)
C:p(x)=x(x-3)^2(2 x+7)^2
D:p(x)=x(x-3)(2 x+7)^2

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph of the polynomial p has x-intercepts at -3.5, 0, and 3. This means that (x+3.5), x, and (x-3) are factors of p(x).
Since -3.5 = -7/2, we can write the factor (x+3.5) as (x + 7/2) or (2x+7)/2. We can take (2x+7) as a factor and adjust the constant later.

The graph touches the x-axis at x=3, suggesting that (x-3) is a repeated factor, specifically (x-3)^2. The x-intercept at 0 is a normal crossing, so the factor x has multiplicity 1. The x-intercept at -3.5 is a normal crossing, so the factor (2x+7) has multiplicity 1.

Therefore, a possible equation for p(x) is p(x) = x(x-3)^2(2x+7).
Comparing this to the answer choices:
A: p(x)=x(x-3)^2(2 x+7)
B: p(x)=x^2(x-3)(2 x+7)
C: p(x)=x(x-3)^2(2 x+7)^2
D: p(x)=x(x-3)(2 x+7)^2

Only choice A matches the analysis above.

Final Answer: A
