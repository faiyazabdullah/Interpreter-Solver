Let $r$ be the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is 18, the radius is $r = 18/2 = 9$.
Let $O$ be the center of the circle, which is also the point $H$.
Since $m \widehat{LM} = 84^\circ$, we have $\angle LHM = 84^\circ$.
Also, $LK \perp MK$. We are given that $MK = 12$.
Let $HP$ be the distance from the center $H$ to the chord $LM$. Since $JK$ is perpendicular to $LM$, $HP$ is the distance from the center to the chord $JK$.
The distance from the center to the chord $LM$ can be calculated as $HP = r \cos(\frac{1}{2} \angle LHM) = 9 \cos(\frac{1}{2} \times 84^\circ) = 9 \cos(42^\circ)$.
We have $\cos(42^\circ) \approx 0.7431$.
$HP = 9 \cos(42^\circ) \approx 9 \times 0.7431 \approx 6.6879$.
So $HP \approx 6.69$.
Also, the distance from the center to the chord $JK$ is given as 18.
We are given that $PK = 12$. Let $x = HP$. Then $x^2 + 12^2 = 9^2$.
$HP$ is not the distance from the center to $JK$, but to $LM$.
Let the distance from $H$ to the chord $LM$ be $d$. Then $d = |r \cos (\frac{1}{2} (84^{\circ}))| = 9 \cos(42^\circ) \approx 9(0.7431) \approx 6.6879 \approx 6.69$.
Since $PLMK$ is a rectangle, we know that $PL = KM = 12$. Also $HP \perp LM$.
Given that $HJ = 18$, and the diameter is 18, then the radius is $r = 9$.
We want to find $HP$. Since $LM$ is a chord, the distance from $H$ to $LM$ is $HP$.
Since $m\widehat{LM} = 84^{\circ}$, then $\angle LHM = 84^{\circ}$. Therefore, $HP = r \cos(\frac{84^{\circ}}{2}) = r \cos(42^{\circ}) = 9 \cos(42^{\circ}) \approx 9 \times 0.7431448254773941 = 6.688303429296547 \approx 6.69$.
The question says that $JK$ is the hypotenuse to $LM$ at $P$. It should be that $JK$ is perpendicular to $LM$ at $P$.
