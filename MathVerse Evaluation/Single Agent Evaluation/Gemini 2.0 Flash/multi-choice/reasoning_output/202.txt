Let $\angle BAC = 38^{\circ}$ and $\angle BCA = 33^{\circ}$.
We want to find the measure of $\angle ABC$.
Since lines $l$ and $m$ are parallel, the angles $\angle BAC$ and $\angle BCA$ are interior angles on the same side of the transversal. However, these are not same-side interior angles.

Let's consider the triangle $\triangle ABC$. The sum of the angles in $\triangle ABC$ is $180^{\circ}$.
We have $\angle BAC = 38^{\circ}$ and $\angle BCA = 33^{\circ}$.
Then, $\angle ABC = 180^{\circ} - \angle BAC - \angle BCA = 180^{\circ} - 38^{\circ} - 33^{\circ} = 180^{\circ} - 71^{\circ} = 109^{\circ}$.
However, none of the answer choices are $109^{\circ}$.

Since $l$ and $m$ are parallel, the alternate interior angles are congruent. The angle between line $l$ and the transversal is $38^\circ$. The alternate interior angle between line $m$ and the transversal is also $38^\circ$. Similarly, the angle between line $m$ and the transversal is $33^\circ$, so the alternate interior angle between line $l$ and the transversal is also $33^\circ$.
Let's label the angle at vertex $B$ as $x$. Then $x = 38^\circ + 33^\circ = 71^\circ$.
Therefore, $\angle ABC = 38^{\circ} + 33^{\circ} = 71^{\circ}$.
