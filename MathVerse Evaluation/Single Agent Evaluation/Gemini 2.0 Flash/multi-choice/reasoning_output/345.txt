QUESTION:
Luke sailed for 116 kilometres on a bearing of 231^\circ .

If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, find $w$ to one decimal place.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The bearing of 231^\circ is measured clockwise from the North. Let's find the angle between the west direction and the direction Luke sailed.
The angle between the North and the West is 270^\circ.
The angle between the North and Luke's direction is 231^\circ.
The angle between the West and Luke's direction is $270^\circ - 231^\circ = 39^\circ$.

We are given that the distance Luke sailed is 116 km. We want to find the distance he sailed west, which is $w$.
We can use the cosine function to find $w$.
$w = 116 \cos(39^\circ)$.
$w \approx 116 \times 0.77714596145 \approx 90.1489315282$
We need to find $w$ to one decimal place.
$w \approx 90.1$
