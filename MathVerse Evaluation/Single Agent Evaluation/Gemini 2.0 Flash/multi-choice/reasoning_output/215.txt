B:10 \pi
C:16 \pi
D:20 \pi

The rectangle inscribed in the circle has sides of length 8 inches and 6 inches. The diagonal of the rectangle is the diameter of the circle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the diagonal is $\sqrt{8^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{64 + 36} = \sqrt{100} = 10$ inches. Thus, the diameter of the circle is 10 inches, and the radius is 5 inches.
The circumference of the circle is given by $C = 2 \pi r = \pi d$, where $r$ is the radius and $d$ is the diameter.
Since the diameter is 10 inches, the circumference is $10\pi$ inches.
Comparing with the answer choices, we have:
A: $8 \pi$
B: $10 \pi$
C: $16 \pi$
D: $20 \pi$
The exact circumference of the circle is $10 \pi$, which corresponds to answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
