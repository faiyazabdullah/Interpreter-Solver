GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows a piecewise linear function.
For x < -1, the line passes through (-4, -1) and (-3, -2). The slope is (-2 - (-1))/(-3 - (-4)) = -1/1 = -1.
The equation of the line is y - (-1) = -1(x - (-4)), so y + 1 = -x - 4, which means y = -x - 5.
For -1 <= x <= 0, the line passes through (-1, 0) and (0, 1). The slope is (1 - 0)/(0 - (-1)) = 1/1 = 1.
The equation of the line is y - 0 = 1(x - (-1)), so y = x + 1.
For x > 0, the line passes through (0, 1) and (1, 2). The slope is (2 - 1)/(1 - 0) = 1/1 = 1.
The equation of the line is y - 1 = 1(x - 0), so y = x + 1.
Therefore, the function can be defined as follows:
f(x) = -x - 5, for x < -1
f(x) = x + 1, for x >= -1
