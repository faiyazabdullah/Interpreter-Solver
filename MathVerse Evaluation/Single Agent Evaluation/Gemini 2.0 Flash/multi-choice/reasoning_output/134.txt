QUESTION:
As shown in the picture, Xiaoying designed a flashlight to measure the height of an ancient city wall. Place a horizontal plane mirror at point P. The light starts from point A and is reflected by the plane mirror and hits the top C of the ancient city wall CD. It is known that AB perpendicular  BD, CD perpendicular  BD. And it is measured that AB = 1.4, BP = 2.1, PD = 12.0. Then the height of the ancient city wall CD is ()

CHOICES:
A:6米
B:8米
C:10米
D:12米

According to the principle of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Therefore, $\angle APB = \angle CPD$. Also, since $AB \perp BD$ and $CD \perp BD$, we have $\angle B = \angle D = 90^\circ$. Thus, $\triangle ABP \sim \triangle CDP$. Therefore, $\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BP}{DP}$. Plugging in the given values, we have $\frac{1.4}{CD} = \frac{2.1}{12}$. Thus, $CD = \frac{1.4 \times 12}{2.1} = \frac{1.4 \times 12}{\frac{21}{10}} = \frac{1.4 \times 12 \times 10}{21} = \frac{14 \times 12}{21} = \frac{2 \times 12}{3} = 2 \times 4 = 8$. Therefore, $CD = 8$ meters.
