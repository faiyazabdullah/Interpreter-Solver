QUESTION:
Two small circles are inscribed to the biggest circle. The diameter of the biggest circle is 20. Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.

C:235.6
D:314.2

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The diameter of the biggest circle is 20, so its radius is 10. The area of the biggest circle is pi * r^2 = pi * 10^2 = 100pi.
The two small circles are inscribed in the biggest circle, and their diameters are half of the biggest circle's diameter, which is 10. So, their radii are 5.
The area of one small circle is pi * r^2 = pi * 5^2 = 25pi.
Since there are two small circles, their total area is 2 * 25pi = 50pi.
The area of the shaded region is the area of the biggest circle minus the area of the two small circles.
So, the area of the shaded region is 100pi - 50pi = 50pi.
Using pi â‰ˆ 3.14159, the area of the shaded region is approximately 50 * 3.14159 = 157.0795.
Rounding to the nearest tenth, the area of the shaded region is 157.1.
