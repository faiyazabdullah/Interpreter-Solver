QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in circle O, point M is the midpoint of arc AB. Connect MO and extend it to intersect circle O at point N, connect BN, if angle AOB = 140.0, then the degree of angle N is ()

CHOICES:
A:70°
B:40°
C:35°
D:20°

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Since point M is the midpoint of arc AB, we know that arc AM = arc BM. Thus, angle AOM = angle BOM = (1/2) * angle AOB.
Given angle AOB = 140°, then angle BOM = (1/2) * 140° = 70°.
Angle BON is an inscribed angle subtending arc BN. Angle BON is equal to angle BOM since M, O, and N are collinear, therefore angle BON = 70°.
The inscribed angle BON intercepts arc BN. According to the inscribed angle theorem, the inscribed angle is half the central angle that subtends the same arc.
So, angle N = (1/2) * angle BOM = (1/2) * 70° = 35°.
