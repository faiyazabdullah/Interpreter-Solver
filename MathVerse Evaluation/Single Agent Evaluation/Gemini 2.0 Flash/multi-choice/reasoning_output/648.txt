QUESTION:
Find the volume of the sphere shown. The radius is 3 centimeters.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere. In this case, the radius is given as 3 cm.
Plugging in the radius into the formula, we get:
$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (3^3)$
$V = \frac{4}{3}\pi (27)$
$V = 4\pi (9)$
$V = 36\pi$
Now we approximate $\pi$ as 3.14159:
$V \approx 36 \times 3.14159$
$V \approx 113.09724$
Rounding to two decimal places, we get:
$V \approx 113.10$
The volume of the sphere is approximately 113.10 cubic centimeters.
Since we are not given answer choices, we cannot choose A, B, C, or D. However, let's assume there are answer choices and we were to compute the volume.
The volume is $36\pi \approx 113.10$
