The circle intersects the x-axis at approximately -2 and -6. The center of the circle appears to be at (-4, -3).  The distance from the center to the x-axis at -2 is the radius. This distance is visually estimated as approximately 2.  The equation of the circle is (x+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = r^2. Plugging in (-2,0) as a point on the circle gives (-2+4)^2 + (0+3)^2 = r^2 or 4+9 = r^2 or r^2=13.  Then r = sqrt(13) ~ 3.6. Let's instead use the point (-6,0).  (-6+4)^2 + (0+3)^2 = r^2 or 4+9=r^2, so r^2=13 and r=sqrt(13) ~ 3.6.  Let's consider the y-axis intersection. Approximately, it's at (0, -3 + sqrt(13)) and (0, -3-sqrt(13)).  Those values are close to (0, 0.6) and (0, -6.6).  These coordinates are approximations. I am visually estimating the radius as being between 3 and 4.
