The sum of the angles around a point is 360°. Therefore, the angle adjacent to the 126° angle on the inside of the large triangle is 360° - 126° = 234°. However, we need to find the angles in the triangle formed by the a and b angles. The angle adjacent to the 126° angle forms a straight line, so the angle adjacent to 126° inside the small triangle is 180° - 126° = 54°.

The sum of the angles in the small triangle is 180°. We know one angle is 54° and the other two angles are a and b. Thus, a + b + 54° = 180°. Since a + b = 54°, we can substitute that in to find 54° + 54° = 108° ≠ 180°. This indicates that 54° is the angle between two of the smaller triangles with a and b.

The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°.
In the smaller triangle, we have angles a, b, and 180° - 126° = 54°.
So, a + b + 54° = 180°
Since a + b = 54°, we can substitute:
54° + 54° = 108°. Wait, that is wrong as it should be 180 degrees.
Instead, let's consider the large triangle. The angles are x, a+b and a+b. The sum is 180.
So x + (a+b) + (a+b) = 180.
x + 54° + 54° = 180°
x + 108° = 180°
x = 180° - 108°
x = 72°
