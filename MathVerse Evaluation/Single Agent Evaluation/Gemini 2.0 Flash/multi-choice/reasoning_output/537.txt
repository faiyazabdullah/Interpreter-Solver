GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The period of a trigonometric function is the distance between two consecutive maximum or minimum points.
In this case, we are given a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$.
The horizontal distance between these two points is $\frac{3}{4} \pi - \frac{1}{4} \pi = \frac{2}{4} \pi = \frac{1}{2} \pi$.
However, the distance between a maximum and a minimum is only half the period. Therefore, the full period is twice this distance.
So, the period is $2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi = \pi$.
