QUESTION:
The logarithm function and a line are graphed. Logarithm function $f$ is graphed in blue and it goes through (30,4), (5,2), (55,5). Line $y=4$ is graphed in red and parallel to x-axis. A pharmaceutical scientist making a new medication wonders how much of the active ingredient to include in a dose. They are curious how long different amounts of the active ingredient will stay in someone's bloodstream.

The amount of time (in hours) the active ingredient remains in the bloodstream can be modeled by $f(x)=-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, where $x$ is the initial amount of the active ingredient (in milligrams). Here is the graph of $f$ and the graph of the line $y=4$.

Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection point of the graphs?

Choose all answers that apply:

CHOICES:
A:It describes the amount of time the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream if the initial amount of the active ingredient is $4 \mathrm{mg}$.
B:
C:It gives the solution to the equation $-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=4$.
D:It describes the situation where the initial amount of the active ingredient is equal to how long it stays in the bloodstream.
E:
F:It gives the initial amount of the active ingredient such that the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.

The graph shows the function $f(x) = -1.25 \ln\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, which models the time (in hours) the active ingredient remains in the bloodstream, where $x$ is the initial amount of the active ingredient (in milligrams). The line $y = 4$ represents the time the active ingredient remains in the bloodstream is 4 hours. The intersection point of the graphs represents the value of $x$ for which $f(x) = 4$.

Choice A: It describes the amount of time the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream if the initial amount of the active ingredient is $4 \mathrm{mg}$.
This is incorrect. The intersection point gives the initial amount of the active ingredient ($x$) when the time is 4 hours ($f(x)=4$). So, $x=30$, not 4.

Choice B: There is no choice B.

Choice C: It gives the solution to the equation $-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=4$.
This is correct. The intersection point gives the $x$-value that satisfies the equation $-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=4$.
From the graph, the x-value of the intersection is approximately 30.

Choice D: It describes the situation where the initial amount of the active ingredient is equal to how long it stays in the bloodstream.
This is incorrect. The x-axis represents the initial amount of active ingredient, and the y-axis represents how long it stays in the bloodstream. The line $y=x$ would represent the situation where the initial amount is equal to the time it stays in the bloodstream. The intersection of the two graphs does not represent this.

Choice E: There is no choice E.

Choice F: It gives the initial amount of the active ingredient such that the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.
This is correct. The intersection point of the graphs of $f(x)$ and $y=4$ corresponds to the amount of initial active ingredient (x) such that the ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.

We need to determine which statements are correct. C and F are correct. From the graph, we see that the intersection point is approximately (30, 4). This means that when the initial amount of the active ingredient is approximately 30 mg, the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.

The $x$-value of the intersection point is the solution to the equation $-1.25 \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 4$. So, the correct statements are C and F. Since we have to pick from given choices, let's focus on what we can get. We know that the solution to the equation $-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=4$ is x = 30.
