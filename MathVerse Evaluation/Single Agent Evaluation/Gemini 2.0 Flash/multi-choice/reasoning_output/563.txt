The discriminant of a quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $b^2 - 4ac$. The discriminant determines the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation.
- If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots.
- If the discriminant is zero, the equation has one real root (a repeated root).
- If the discriminant is negative, the equation has no real roots (two complex roots).

The graph of a quadratic function $y = g(x)$ intersects the x-axis at the roots of the equation $g(x) = 0$.
From the graph, we can see that the parabola intersects the x-axis at only one point, which is the vertex (-3,0). This means that the quadratic equation $g(x) = 0$ has one real root.
Therefore, the discriminant of $g(x)$ must be zero.
