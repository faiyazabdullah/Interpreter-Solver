Given that AB is the diameter of circle O, and ∠BOD = 130°.
We want to find the measure of ∠ACD.
Since ∠BOD is a central angle, we can find the measure of the arc BD. The measure of arc BD is equal to the measure of the central angle ∠BOD, so arc BD = 130°.
∠BAD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BD. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, ∠BAD = (1/2) * arc BD = (1/2) * 130° = 65°.
Since AB is a diameter, ∠ADB is an inscribed angle that intercepts a semicircle, so ∠ADB = 90°.
In triangle ABD, the sum of the angles is 180°, so ∠ABD = 180° - ∠BAD - ∠ADB = 180° - 65° - 90° = 25°.
Since points A, B, C, and D are on the circle, quadrilateral ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary, meaning their sum is 180°.
Therefore, ∠ACD + ∠ABD = 180°.
∠ACD + ∠ABD = 180°, so ∠ACD = 180° - ∠ABD = 180° - 130°/2 = 180° - 65° = 115° does not seem right.

Instead, since AB is the diameter, ∠ACB = 90°.
Since ∠BOD = 130°, then the measure of arc BD is 130°.
Then the measure of arc BC is 180° - 130° = 50°.
The inscribed angle ∠BAC intercepts arc BC, so the measure of ∠BAC = (1/2) * 50° = 25°.
In right triangle ABC, ∠ABC = 90° - ∠BAC = 90° - 25° = 65°.
Since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, ∠ACD + ∠ABD = 180°. We found that ∠ABD = 25 degrees
∠ACD + 25 = 180°
This is incorrect.

Since ∠BOD = 130°, the arc BD is 130°.
The angle subtended by arc BD at the circumference is ∠BAD = (1/2)*arcBD = (1/2)*130° = 65°.
Since ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral, ∠BAD + ∠BCD = 180°.
Thus, ∠BCD = 180° - 65° = 115°. Also,  ∠ACD + ∠ACB = 115°. Since AB is a diameter,  ∠ACB = 90°.
Thus, ∠ACD = 115° - 90° = 25°.
