QUESTION:
As shown in the picture, it is an ancient masher in the countryside. It is known that the height of the support column AB is 0.3, the length of the pedal DE is 1.0, and the distance from the support point A to the foot D is 0.6. When foot D touches the ground, the head point E rises ()

CHOICES:
A:0.5米
B:0.6米
C:0.3米
D:0.9米

The ancient masher in the countryside can be considered as a lever. The support point A is the fulcrum, point D is the point of application of force, and point E is the point where the object is lifted. When foot D touches the ground, the distance from D to the fulcrum A is 0.6, and the distance from E to the fulcrum A is 1.0-0.6=0.4. The height of the support column AB is 0.3. Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height E rises to the height of the support column is the same as the ratio of the distance from E to A to the distance from D to A. Therefore, the rising height of E is (0.3 * 0.4)/0.6 = 0.2. However, the problem states that the length of the pedal DE is 1.0, and the distance from the support point A to the foot D is 0.6. So the distance from A to E along the pedal is 1.0. The distance from D to A is 0.6. The height of A above the ground is 0.3.
We are looking for the height E rises when D touches the ground.
Let the height E rises be x. Since the triangles are similar, we have x/0.3 = 1/0.6. Therefore x = 0.3 * (1/0.6) = 0.3 * (10/6) = 0.3 * (5/3) = 1.5/3 = 0.5
The head point E rises 0.5 meters.
