QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is 6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The line has x-intercept -3 and y-intercept 6. The equation of the line can be found using the intercept form:
x/a + y/b = 1, where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept.
So, x/(-3) + y/6 = 1
Multiply by -6 to eliminate fractions:
2x - y = -6
Rearrange to get y in terms of x:
y = 2x + 6

The line is dashed, so the inequality will be either > or <.
The shaded region is above the line, so we use the greater than sign.
The inequality is y > 2x + 6
Rewrite in the form 2x - y < -6

However, we need to determine whether it is greater than or greater than or equal to because the line is dashed.
Since the line is dashed, the inequality is strict. The region is above the line y = 2x + 6. Therefore, the inequality is y > 2x + 6.

We can test a point in the shaded region, such as (0, 10).
10 > 2(0) + 6
10 > 6, which is true.

Also the inequality can be written as
-x/3 + y/6 > 1
Multiply by 6
-2x + y > 6
or y > 2x+6
2x -y < -6

Since the given options are unavailable, I assume the question only wanted to find the inequality representing the figure.  The inequality is y > 2x + 6, which can also be written as 2x - y < -6.
