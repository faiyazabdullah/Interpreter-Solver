The rectangle is divided into eight triangles by four lines through the center. The shaded area consists of four triangles.
Since the lines pass through the center of the rectangle, each triangle is congruent to its opposite triangle. The four shaded triangles occupy 4 out of the 8 triangles.
The fraction of the area of the rectangle that is shaded is 4/8 = 1/2.
However, the lines drawn don't seem to divide the rectangle into 8 equal areas, so the triangles are not necessarily of the same area.
Consider the lines through the rectangle. Since the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other, the intersection of the four lines is the center of the rectangle. The intersection is also the midpoint of the rectangle.
The shaded regions are composed of triangles. The four triangles appear to have equal bases, since they are on the perimeter.
Therefore, the bases of each of the shaded triangles are equal.
The height of each triangle is the distance from the intersection (center of the rectangle) to the base.
Therefore, each shaded triangle has equal area.
If we move the top shaded triangle to the middle triangle on the right, then the area of the two shaded triangles on the top is equal to the area of the two triangles on the right.
The same applies to the bottom two shaded triangles to the left side.
The area of the 4 shaded triangles is 1/2 * bh * 4 = 2bh.
The area of the four white triangles is 1/2 * bh * 4 = 2bh.
Therefore the area is 1/2 of the entire rectangle. This means the shaded area is 4/8.

Since the rectangle is divided into eight triangles, and four of them are shaded, the fraction of the area of the rectangle that is shaded is 4/8, which simplifies to 1/2. However, this is not among the possible answers.

Let's assume the question is trying to trick us. We are told there are four lines, and they intersect at the center. The rectangle has 8 triangles.
If we consider the diagonals of a rectangle and two lines horizontal, each forming a 45-degree angle with the diagonal.
The four shaded triangles account for 1/2 of the rectangle's area.
It must be a trick. The lines pass through the center. If we rotate a non-shaded triangle, it exactly covers up a shaded triangle. So four out of 8, simplifies to 1/2.
There must be an error. Assume all areas are equal. 4 shaded / 8 total. 1/2.
However, we must pick from A, B, C, D.
There is an error. The closest answer to 1/2 is 3/8 or 1/4.

Consider if it were a square. Diagonals would create equal sizes. In a rectangle, the sizes are similar but one side is stretched. But the proportion remains the same.

I will choose the closest.
