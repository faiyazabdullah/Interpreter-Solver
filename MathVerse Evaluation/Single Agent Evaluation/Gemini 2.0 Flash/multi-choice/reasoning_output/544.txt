QUESTION:
Kai is swinging on a trapeze in a circus show. The horizontal distance between Kai and the edge of the stage, in meters, is modeled by $D(t)$ where $t$ is the time in seconds. The function is graphed below, along with one segment highlighted, a red double arrow from (5,21) to (15,21). What is the meaning of the highlighted segment?

CHOICES:
A:Kai completes 10 swing cycles per second.
B:The trapeze is hung $\mathbf{1 0}$ meters from the edge of the stage.
C:Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds.
D:The trapeze is $\mathbf{1 0}$ meters long.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The highlighted segment spans from $t = 5$ to $t = 15$. The length of this interval is $15 - 5 = 10$. During this time interval, the distance $D(t)$ goes from a maximum value of 21 meters, down to a minimum, and then back up to the maximum value of 21 meters. This means that the time interval of 10 seconds corresponds to one complete cycle of the swing. Therefore, Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds.
