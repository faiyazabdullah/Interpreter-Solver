GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the image, the path from the school to the bus stop is a straight line. If Sally goes through the playground, she has to walk along two sides of the triangle connecting the school, the playground, and the bus stop. Since the length of one side of a triangle is always less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides, the path from the school to the bus stop will be quicker if Sally does not go through the playground. Therefore, it will be quicker if Sally takes the path directly from school to bus stop rather than through the playground.

Final Answer: A
