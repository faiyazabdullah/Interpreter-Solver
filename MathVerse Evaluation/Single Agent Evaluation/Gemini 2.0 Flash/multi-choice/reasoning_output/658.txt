The water trough is in the shape of a half cylinder.
The height (length) of the trough is 2.49 m.
The radius is 0.92 m.
We need to find the surface area of the outside of this water trough.
The surface area consists of:
1. The curved surface of the half cylinder which is (1/2) * 2 * pi * r * h = pi * r * h
2. The area of the rectangular base which is 2 * r * h
3. The area of the two half circles which is equal to the area of one full circle = pi * r^2

So the total surface area = pi * r * h + 2 * r * h + pi * r^2
= pi * 0.92 * 2.49 + 2 * 0.92 * 2.49 + pi * (0.92)^2
= 3.14159 * 0.92 * 2.49 + 2 * 0.92 * 2.49 + 3.14159 * (0.92)^2
= 7.1713 + 4.5804 + 2.6590
= 14.4107

The surface area of the outside of this water trough = pi * r * l + 2 * r * l + pi * r^2
where r = 0.92 m and l = 2.49 m
Area = pi * 0.92 * 2.49 + 2 * 0.92 * 2.49 + pi * (0.92)^2
= pi * 2.2908 + 4.5804 + pi * 0.8464
= 7.1966 + 4.5804 + 2.66
= 14.437

Area = pi * 0.92 * 2.49 + 2 * 0.92 * 2.49 + pi * (0.92)^2
= 3.14159265359 * 0.92 * 2.49 + 2 * 0.92 * 2.49 + 3.14159265359 * 0.92 * 0.92
= 7.1965875148 + 4.5804 + 2.66090488217
= 14.43789239697
Rounded to two decimal places: 14.44
