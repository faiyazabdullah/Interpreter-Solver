GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The volume of a pyramid is given by the formula V = (1/3) * base area * height.

The base is a square with side length 11 mm, so the base area is 11 mm * 11 mm = 121 mm^2.

The height of the pyramid is given as 7 mm.

Therefore, the volume is V = (1/3) * 121 mm^2 * 7 mm = (1/3) * 847 mm^3 = 282.333... mm^3.

There are no answer choices provided. I will provide a final answer but without a corresponding letter.
