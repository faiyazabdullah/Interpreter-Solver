The problem asks for the true bearing of A from O. The true bearing is the angle measured clockwise from North. In the diagram, the angle between the positive x-axis and OA is 28 degrees. The angle from North to the positive x-axis is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle from North to OA is 90 + 28 = 118 degrees.

Final Answer: A
