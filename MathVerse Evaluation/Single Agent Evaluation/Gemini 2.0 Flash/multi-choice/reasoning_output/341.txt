The bearing of a point is the angle, measured clockwise, from the north direction. The true bearing is measured with respect to the geographic North.
We are given that angle A in triangle ABC is 42° and angle B is 53°.
Let the true bearing of C from A be denoted as θ.
From the image, the direction indicated by the upward arrow at A represents the North direction. The angle between the North direction and the line segment AB, measured clockwise, is given as 42°. Thus, the bearing of B from A is 42°.
Since the angles in a triangle sum to 180°, angle C in triangle ABC is 180° - (42° + 53°) = 180° - 95° = 85°.

To find the true bearing of C from A, we need to find the angle between the North direction at A and the line segment AC, measured clockwise.
From the diagram, the angle between the North direction at A and the line segment AB is 42°.
The bearing of C from A can be found by looking at the angle BAC, which is 42°.
So, the true bearing of C from A is equal to the angle measured clockwise from the North direction at point A to the line AC.

In this case, the angle between the North and the line AC is 42 degrees.
So, the true bearing of C from A is 42 degrees plus 180 degrees = 42 + 180 = 222 degrees (measured from North direction).

Therefore, the true bearing of point C from point A is 42°.
