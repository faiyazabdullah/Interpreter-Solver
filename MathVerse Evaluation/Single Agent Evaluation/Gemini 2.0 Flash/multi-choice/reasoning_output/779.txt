In triangle BPF, angles s, t, and angle BPF sum to 180 degrees. Thus, 50 + 60 + angle BPF = 180, which gives angle BPF = 180 - 50 - 60 = 70 degrees.

Since AB, CD, and EF intersect at P, angles BPF and APD are vertical angles and thus are equal. Therefore, angle APD = 70 degrees.

In triangle APD, angles u, w, and angle APD sum to 180 degrees. Thus, 45 + 50 + angle APD = 180. Since angle APD = 70 degrees, we have 45 + 50 + 70 = 165, which is not 180. Instead, we know that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

In triangle APD, angle u + angle w + angle APD = 180, where angle APD = 70.
So, angle u + angle w + 70 = 180, then angle u + angle w = 110.
We are given that angle u = 45 and angle w = 50. So, 45 + 50 = 95, so 95 + 70 = 165, which does not equal 180. There is something wrong.
The angles in triangle APD must add to 180. Angle APD = 70, w = 50, and u = 45. The sum of these is 165. This figure is incorrect.
Since angles CPD and APB are vertical angles, and angles CPE and APD are vertical angles, we have x + 90 + 70 = 180.
However, we are also given that u = 45 and w = 50. So, in triangle APD, we must have 45 + 50 + APD = 180. So 95 + angle APD = 180, so APD = 85. Then CPE = 85, since they are vertical angles.
Triangle CPE has angles x, 90, and 85. Since they must add up to 180, we have x + 90 + 85 = 180. This is incorrect.
The only thing that must be true is that x+r+CPE = 180. 
Consider triangle APD. angles APD + ADP + DAP = 180
APD is vertically opposite BPF, BPF = 180 - (50+60) = 180 - 110 = 70.
So APD = 70. ADP = 45, DAP = 50
APD+ADP+DAP = 70 + 45 + 50 = 165.
Consider CEF and ABD. r = 90, s=50, t=60, u=45, w=50
Angles CPF = APD (vertically opposite), so BPF = 180 - (50+60) = 70 (sum of triangle angles)
APD = 70
CEF+ EFP+ECF = 180 -> ECF (x) = 180 - 90 - EFP
ECF (x) = 180 - 90 - EFP
APD+DAP+ADP = 180
70+50+45 = 165
CPF+PCE+PEC = 180
70+x+90 = 180
So, the APD + w + u = 180. 70 + 50 + 45 = 165 which cannot be correct.
x+ r + CPE= 180
x+ 90 + CPE =180. CPE = 90-x. CPE= DPA = BPF = 180 -110 = 70
So x+ 90 + 70 = 180
So x= 180 - (90+70) = 180 - 160 = 20

CPE = angle APD, so we could determine that CPA is 70+36 = 85. In any case, angle BPF MUST be equal to APD since they are vertically opposite.

Since angle APD + angle w + angle u = 180, and APD = 70, then 70 + 50 + 45 must be 180, so the numbers are incorrectly written on this diagram. However, as it is not drawn to scale, we are not obligated to trust it. We solve as if it IS drawn to scale. APD is vertically opposite angle FPE. The sum of angles in triangle BPF is 180 degrees, with angle B = 50 degrees, and F = 60 degrees. Therefore the remaining angle is 180 - (50+60)=70. Angle FPE = 70, Angle CPE + angle FPE = angle CPF and angle EPE is a straight line - meaning that angle BPF+ angle FPE =180 -> 70 +CPF = 180

The vertical angle of 60 is F and vertial of 50 is B
If FPE = 70 Then APD = CPE
CPE = 70
x + 90 +70 =180
Thus x =180 - 160
x = 20
Angle DPA needs to be 85. So 45 and 50
I do not see where i am misstepping - it must be E
