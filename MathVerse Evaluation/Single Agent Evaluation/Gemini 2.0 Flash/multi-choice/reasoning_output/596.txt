The line passes through the points (-2,-6) and (2,-3). We need to find the equation of this line.

First, let's find the slope (m) of the line using the formula:
m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
where (x1, y1) = (-2, -6) and (x2, y2) = (2, -3)
m = (-3 - (-6)) / (2 - (-2))
m = (-3 + 6) / (2 + 2)
m = 3 / 4

Now that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:
y - y1 = m(x - x1)
Using the point (-2, -6) and the slope m = 3/4:
y - (-6) = (3/4)(x - (-2))
y + 6 = (3/4)(x + 2)
y + 6 = (3/4)x + (3/4)(2)
y + 6 = (3/4)x + 3/2

Now, we solve for y to get the slope-intercept form (y = mx + b):
y = (3/4)x + 3/2 - 6
y = (3/4)x + 3/2 - 12/2
y = (3/4)x - 9/2

We can also write the equation in standard form, but the problem only asks for "an equation that represents the line" so we can use the slope-intercept form:
y = (3/4)x - 9/2

We can check the other point (2, -3):
-3 = (3/4)(2) - 9/2
-3 = 3/2 - 9/2
-3 = -6/2
-3 = -3
The equation is correct.
