The image shows a circle with center O. The radius OC = 13 inches. The radius OB is perpendicular to chord CD. CD = 24 inches. The measure of arc CD is 134 degrees. We need to find the measure of arc CB.
Since OB is perpendicular to CD at X, then OB bisects CD. Therefore, CX = XD = 24/2 = 12 inches.
Since the measure of arc CD is 134 degrees, the angle COD is 134 degrees.
Consider triangle CXO. We have a right angle at X. We know OC = 13 and CX = 12. We want to find angle COX. sin(COX) = CX/OC = 12/13.
COX = arcsin(12/13) = 67.38 degrees.
Since OB bisects CD, then COX = DOX = 67.38. Therefore, COD = 2 * 67.38 = 134.76. This is close to 134 degrees.
Since COX = 67.38 degrees, and OB is perpendicular to CD, then angle COB = 90 - COX.
Angle BOC = angle COD / 2
m\widehat{CB} = 1/2 * m\widehat{CD}
The measure of the arc CB is half the measure of arc CD
Since OB is perpendicular to CD, it bisects the arc CD.  Then arc CB = arc BD
m \widehat C B = m \widehat B D
m \widehat C D = m \widehat C B + m \widehat B D
Therefore, 134 = 2 m \widehat C B
m \widehat C B = 134/2 = 67 degrees

Final Answer: C
