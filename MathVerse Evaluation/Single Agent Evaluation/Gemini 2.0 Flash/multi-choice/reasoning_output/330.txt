QUESTION:
A rally car starts at point P and races 191 kilometres south to point Q. Here the car turns west and races for 83 kilometres to point R. At point R the car must turn to head directly back to point P.

The problem describes a right triangle PQR, where PQ is 191 km south, QR is 83 km west, and RP is the direct path back to P. We are asked to find the compass bearing of R from P. This means we need to find the angle between the north direction and the line PR, measured clockwise from north.

First, we can find the angle $\alpha$ at R using the tangent function: $\tan(\alpha) = \frac{PQ}{QR} = \frac{191}{83}$. Therefore, $\alpha = \arctan(\frac{191}{83}) \approx 66.5^{\circ}$.

The bearing of R from P is the angle between the north direction and PR, measured clockwise. Since PQ is due south, the angle between PQ and PR is $90 - \alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the angle at R. However, that is not the angle we want.
Let $\theta$ be the angle RPQ. Then $\tan(\theta) = \frac{83}{191}$, so $\theta = \arctan(\frac{83}{191}) \approx 23.5^{\circ}$.

The bearing of R from P is the angle measured clockwise from North.  Since R is West and South of P, the bearing is $180^{\circ} + \beta$ where $\beta$ is the angle which a line pointing directly South makes with the line to R. We have $\beta = 90 - \alpha$.
We want the bearing of R from P. The angle RPQ is given by $\tan^{-1} (\frac{83}{191})$, which is the angle between the South line and the line to R.
The bearing is $180 + tan^{-1}(83/191) \approx 180 + 23.5 = 203.5$.
However, the required angle is the acute angle from the North direction in the North West part. Therefore, bearing from P to R is $180 + \arctan(\frac{83}{191})$. Then this is $180 + 23.5 = 203.5^{\circ}$.

The bearing is $180^\circ + arctan(83/191)$. The arctan(83/191) = 23.5 degrees. Then $180+23.5 = 203.5$ degrees.
