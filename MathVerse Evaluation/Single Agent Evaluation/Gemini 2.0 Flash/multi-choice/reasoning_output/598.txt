QUESTION:
The figure has two segments. Use the vertical line test to determine whether the curve is the graph of a function.

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The vertical line test states that if any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then the graph is not the graph of a function. In the given figure, we can see that a vertical line would intersect the curve at most once. However, there is an x value for which there are two y values. Hence, the graph is not the graph of a function.

Final Answer: B
