QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (0,1) and when the value of x increases the value of y increases, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The graph represents a function. To determine if the function has an inverse, we need to check if it is a one-to-one function. A function is one-to-one if it passes the horizontal line test. In other words, any horizontal line drawn on the graph intersects the function at most once.

Looking at the graph, any horizontal line will intersect the curve at most once. This means that the function is one-to-one and has an inverse function.
