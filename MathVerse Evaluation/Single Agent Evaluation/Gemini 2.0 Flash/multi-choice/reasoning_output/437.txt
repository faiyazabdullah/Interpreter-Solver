QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (-1,3) and (-1,-3). It's center is at (-1,0) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at (-1,$3\sqrt{2}$) and (-1, -$3\sqrt{2}$). Find the equation of the hyperbola.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given hyperbola has a vertical transverse axis, with center at (-1,0). The vertices are at (-1,3) and (-1,-3). Thus, a = 3. The foci are at (-1, $3\sqrt{2}$) and (-1, -$3\sqrt{2}$). Thus, c = $3\sqrt{2}$. We know that $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Plugging in the values for a and c, we have $(3\sqrt{2})^2 = 3^2 + b^2$. This gives us $18 = 9 + b^2$, so $b^2 = 9$ and b = 3.
The equation of a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis and center at (h,k) is given by $\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1$. Since the center is (-1,0), a = 3, and b = 3, the equation of the hyperbola is $\frac{(y-0)^2}{3^2} - \frac{(x-(-1))^2}{3^2} = 1$, which simplifies to $\frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{9} = 1$. Multiplying by 9, we get $y^2 - (x+1)^2 = 9$.
