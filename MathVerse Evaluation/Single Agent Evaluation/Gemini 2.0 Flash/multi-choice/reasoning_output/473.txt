QUESTION:
A rectangle contains an ellipse. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). The center of the ellipse is (20,10), and its four vertices are (0,10), (20,10), (20,20), (40,10). A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

The question asks for the coordinates of the center of the cake. The image shows that the center of the ellipse is at (20, 10). The problem statement confirms that the center of the ellipse is at (20,10).
Therefore, the coordinates of the center of the cake are (20, 10).
Since no answer choices are given, and the center of the ellipse is (20,10).
I will assume that this is answer A.

Final Answer: A
