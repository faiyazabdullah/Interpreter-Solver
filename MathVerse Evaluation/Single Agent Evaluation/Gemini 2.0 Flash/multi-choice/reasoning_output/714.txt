The figure consists of a rectangular prism and a triangular prism.
The dimensions of the rectangular prism are 6m x 5m x 10m.
The dimensions of the triangular prism are base 5m, height 3m and length 10m.
We need to find the surface area of the composite prism.

Surface area of the rectangular prism:
Two faces are 6m x 5m, so area = 2 * (6 * 5) = 60 sq meters
Two faces are 6m x 10m, so area = 2 * (6 * 10) = 120 sq meters
One face is 5m x 10m, so area = 1 * (5 * 10) = 50 sq meters
The total surface area of the rectangular prism (without considering the top) = 60 + 120 + 50 = 230 sq meters.

For the triangular prism,
Base of triangle is 5m, height is 3m
Area of each triangle is 0.5 * 5 * 3 = 7.5 sq meters. Two triangles make 2 * 7.5 = 15 sq meters.
The length of each side of the triangle is sqrt(3^2 + 2.5^2) = sqrt(9 + 6.25) = sqrt(15.25) = 3.905 m approximately.
The area of the two rectangular sides is 2 * (3.905 * 10) = 2 * 39.05 = 78.1 sq meters.
The base of the triangle which lies on the rectangle is excluded because the two prisms are joined here. Thus, we do not need to subtract this overlapping area.
The surface area of the triangular prism is 15 + 78.1 = 93.1 sq meters.

So the total surface area is 230 + 93.1 = 323.1 sq meters.
Round the answer to two decimal places: 323.10 sq meters.
