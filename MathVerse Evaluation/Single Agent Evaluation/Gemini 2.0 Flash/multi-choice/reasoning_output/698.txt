GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The volume of the rectangular box is length * width * height = 14cm * 10cm * 8cm = 1120 cm^3.
The hole is a cylinder of radius 2cm and length 14cm. The volume of the cylinder is pi * r^2 * h = pi * (2cm)^2 * 14cm = 56*pi cm^3.
Since pi is approximately 3.14159, the volume of the cylinder is approximately 56 * 3.14159 = 175.92904 cm^3.
The volume of the solid is the volume of the box minus the volume of the cylinder.
Volume of solid = 1120 cm^3 - 56*pi cm^3 = 1120 - 175.92904 = 944.07096 cm^3.
To two decimal places, the volume of the solid is 944.07 cm^3.
