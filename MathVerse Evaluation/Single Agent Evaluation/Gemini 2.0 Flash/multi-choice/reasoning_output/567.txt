QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex of (-5,6). f(x)=4x^2-108. Do the functions have the same concavity, f(x) and g(x)?

CHOICES:
A:Yes, $f$ and $g$ are both concave down.
B:Yes, $f$ and $g$ are both concave up.
C:No, $f$ is concave up and $g$ is concave down.
D:No, $f$ is concave down and $g$ is concave up.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The figure shows $g(x)$ which is a quadratic function that opens downward. The coefficient of $x^2$ is negative. Therefore, $g(x)$ is concave down.
The function $f(x)=4x^2 - 108$ is a quadratic function. Since the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is 4, which is positive, the parabola opens upward. Therefore, $f(x)$ is concave up.
Thus, $f$ is concave up and $g$ is concave down.
