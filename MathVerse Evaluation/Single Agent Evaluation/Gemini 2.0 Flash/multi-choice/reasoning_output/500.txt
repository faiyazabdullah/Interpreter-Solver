QUESTION:
There is a quadratic function that opens upwards symmetric with respect to x=2. The vertex of the parabola is at the point (2,-2). Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant.

The given quadratic function is a parabola that opens upwards. Its vertex is at the point (2, -2). The axis of symmetry is x = 2.

For a parabola that opens upwards:
- The function is decreasing to the left of the vertex.
- The function is increasing to the right of the vertex.

Therefore:
- The function is decreasing on the interval (-infinity, 2).
- The function is increasing on the interval (2, infinity).
- The function is constant nowhere.

No answer choices are provided, so I am unable to compare the solution.
