The image shows a number line with an open circle at -2 and a closed circle at 1. The line between -2 and 1 is shaded. Additionally, the number line extends to the left of -2 and to the right of 1 with arrows at each end.

The shaded part of the number line represents the interval of numbers between -2 and 1. The open circle at -2 indicates that -2 is not included in the interval. The closed circle at 1 indicates that 1 is included in the interval. Therefore, the interval is (-2, 1].
