The graph shows the quadratic function $g(x)$, which opens downward and has a vertex at $(-8, 8)$. The maximum value of $g(x)$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex, which is 8.

The function $f(x)$ is given as $f(x) = -5(x+4)^2 + 8$. This is a quadratic function in vertex form, $f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex. In this case, $a = -5$, $h = -4$, and $k = 8$. Since $a = -5$ is negative, the parabola opens downward, and the vertex represents the maximum point. The vertex of $f(x)$ is $(-4, 8)$. The maximum value of $f(x)$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex, which is 8.

The maximum value of $g(x)$ is 8, and the maximum value of $f(x)$ is 8. Therefore, the two functions share the same maximum.
