GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The surface area of a triangular prism consists of the areas of the two triangular faces and the three rectangular faces.

The area of each triangular face is (1/2) * base * height = (1/2) * 12 cm * 8 cm = 48 sq cm.
Since there are two triangular faces, their combined area is 2 * 48 sq cm = 96 sq cm.

The prism has one rectangular face with dimensions 12 cm by 21 cm, and two rectangular faces with dimensions 10 cm by 21 cm.
The area of the rectangular face with dimensions 12 cm by 21 cm is 12 cm * 21 cm = 252 sq cm.
The area of each rectangular face with dimensions 10 cm by 21 cm is 10 cm * 21 cm = 210 sq cm.
Since there are two such rectangular faces, their combined area is 2 * 210 sq cm = 420 sq cm.

The total surface area of the triangular prism is the sum of the areas of the two triangular faces and the three rectangular faces.
Therefore, the total surface area is 96 sq cm + 252 sq cm + 420 sq cm = 768 sq cm.
