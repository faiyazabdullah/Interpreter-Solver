QUESTION:
The graph of a cubic function  f  is shown in Figure 18 with a labeled point (1.333, 5.185) at its right part. Based on the calculator screen shot, the point  (1.333,5.185)  is which of the following?

CHOICES:
A.a relative (local) maximum of the function
B.the vertex of the function
C.the absolute maximum of the function
D.a zero of the function

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows the graph of a cubic function. The point labeled (1.3333324, 5.1851852) is indicated as a "Maximum" on the calculator screen. This means that in the local area around the point, the function reaches its highest value. This corresponds to the definition of a relative (local) maximum.
A vertex is a term usually used for parabolas, not general cubic functions.
An absolute maximum would be the highest point of the entire function, but the graph continues upwards to the left of the labeled point, so the labeled point is not the absolute maximum.
A zero of the function is a point where the function's value is zero, which occurs when the graph intersects the x-axis. Since the y-coordinate of the given point is 5.185, the point is not a zero.

Therefore, the labeled point is a relative (local) maximum.
