Let the distance from point O to line L be d = 3, and the radius of circle O be r = 1. Let PQ be the tangent to circle O at point Q. Thus, OQ is perpendicular to PQ, and OQ = r = 1.
In right triangle OPQ, we have OP^2 = OQ^2 + PQ^2, so PQ^2 = OP^2 - OQ^2 = OP^2 - 1.
Let x be the distance from the foot of the perpendicular from O to L to point P on line L. Then OP^2 = x^2 + 3^2 = x^2 + 9.
Therefore, PQ^2 = x^2 + 9 - 1 = x^2 + 8.
Since PQRS is a square, the area of square PQRS is PQ^2 = x^2 + 8.
To minimize the area of the square, we need to minimize x^2. The minimum value of x^2 is 0, which occurs when x = 0.
When x = 0, the area of the square is 0^2 + 8 = 8.
Therefore, the minimum area of the square PQRS is 8.
