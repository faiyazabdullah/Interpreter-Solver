The given points are (-7,0), (-5,-5), (0,7), (5,-5), (7,0). The semicircle passes through these points.
The general equation of a circle is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.
Since the semicircle passes through (-7, 0) and (7, 0), the y-coordinate of the center must be the minimum y-value of the semicircle. The vertex of the semicircle is approximately around (0, -7).
Let's analyze the figure more carefully. The semicircle is symmetric about the y-axis. This means that the x-coordinate of the center must be 0. The semicircle passes through (-7, 0) and (7, 0). These are the x-intercepts of the semicircle. The midpoint of the x-intercepts is ((7 + (-7))/2, (0+0)/2) = (0, 0). This suggests that the center is on the y-axis. The lowest point of the semicircle is at around y = -7.
Since the points (-7,0) and (7,0) lie on the semicircle, the center will be at (0, k) for some value of k.
The radius is the distance from the center (0, k) to any point on the semicircle.
The distance from the center (0, k) to the point (7, 0) is $\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (0-k)^2} = \sqrt{49 + k^2}$.
If we assume the center is at (0, -7), then the radius would be $\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (0-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} \approx 9.9$. This is too large for the semicircle.
Based on the given points, the center is likely located at (0,0). However, the semicircle is below the x-axis, so the center is likely at (0, a) for some negative a.
Since (7,0) is on the curve, the radius is sqrt(49+a^2).
Since (5,-5) is on the curve, the radius is sqrt(25+(a+5)^2).
Since the radius is the same, 49+a^2 = 25+a^2+10a+25.
49 = 50+10a => 10a=-1 => a=-0.1
This doesn't seem quite right. Let's try to visually locate the center. The semicircle appears to have a radius of 7 and its center is somewhere below the x-axis. The figure strongly suggests that the center is at (0, -7).

The center of the semicircle is (0, -7).
