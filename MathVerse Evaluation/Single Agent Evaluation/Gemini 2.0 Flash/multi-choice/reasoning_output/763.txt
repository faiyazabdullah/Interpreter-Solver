QUESTION:
In the figure above, the four circles have the same center and their radii are 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. They form two shaded rings and two write rings. What is the ratio of the area of the small shaded ring to the area of the large shaded ring?

CHOICES:
A.1:2
B.1:4
C.3:5
D.3:7
E.5:7

Let $r_1 = 1, r_2 = 2, r_3 = 3, r_4 = 4$ be the radii of the four circles.
The area of the small shaded ring is the area of the circle with radius 2 minus the area of the circle with radius 1.
$A_1 = \pi r_2^2 - \pi r_1^2 = \pi (2^2 - 1^2) = \pi (4-1) = 3\pi$

The area of the large shaded ring is the area of the circle with radius 4 minus the area of the circle with radius 3.
$A_2 = \pi r_4^2 - \pi r_3^2 = \pi (4^2 - 3^2) = \pi (16-9) = 7\pi$

The ratio of the area of the small shaded ring to the area of the large shaded ring is
$\frac{A_1}{A_2} = \frac{3\pi}{7\pi} = \frac{3}{7}$

Therefore, the ratio is 3:7.
