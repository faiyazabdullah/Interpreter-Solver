Let the radius of the semicircle be $r$. Since $AB = 8$, we have $2r = 8$, so $r = 4$.
Let $O$ be the center of the circle. Let $d$ be the distance from $O$ to $A'B'$. Since the water surface rises by 1, the distance from $O$ to $A'B'$ is $4-1 = 3$.
Let $x$ be half the length of $A'B'$. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $x^2 + 3^2 = 4^2$, so $x^2 + 9 = 16$, and $x^2 = 16-9 = 7$. Thus $x = \sqrt{7}$.
The length of $A'B'$ is $2x = 2\sqrt{7}$.

However, according to the problem statement, the radius is 4, and the distance from the center to $A'B'$ is 3.
Let's denote the radius by r, which is AB/2 = 8/2 = 4.
Let's denote the rise in water level by h, which is 1.
Then the distance from the center to the new water level is r-h = 4-1 = 3.
If we form a right triangle with radius r, half of the new width x, and the distance to the new water level r-h, we have:
x^2 + (r-h)^2 = r^2
x^2 + (4-1)^2 = 4^2
x^2 + 3^2 = 16
x^2 + 9 = 16
x^2 = 7
x = sqrt(7)
The width of the new water level is 2x = 2*sqrt(7).

Let's consider a slightly different scenario.
The original water level is AB = 8. The radius is r = 4. The center is O.
The new water level is A'B', with a rise of 1.
The distance from O to A'B' is 4-1=3.
Let A'B'/2 = x. Then x^2 + 3^2 = 4^2.
x^2 + 9 = 16
x^2 = 7
x = sqrt(7)
A'B' = 2*sqrt(7).

However, it seems there might be an error in my calculations. Let's reconsider.
Let r be the radius = 4. The water level rises 1 unit. So, the distance from the center of the circle to the water level is 4-1 = 3.
(A'B'/2)^2 + 3^2 = 4^2
(A'B'/2)^2 + 9 = 16
(A'B'/2)^2 = 7
A'B'/2 = sqrt(7)
A'B' = 2sqrt(7)

None of the options are equal to 2√7.
If the water level drops by 1, then A'B'/2 = x. (A'B'/2)^2 + (4+1)^2 = 4^2. It does not make sense.

I made a mistake. The vertical distance from the center of the semi-circle to the chord A'B' is 4-1=3.

So (A'B'/2)^2 + 3^2 = 4^2
(A'B'/2)^2 + 9 = 16
(A'B'/2)^2 = 7
So A'B'/2 = sqrt(7)
And A'B' = 2sqrt(7) = sqrt(28). None of these are the right answers.

Let's use the formula: width = 2 * sqrt(r^2 - d^2) where r is radius and d is distance from center.
radius = 4
d = 4-1 = 3.
width = 2 * sqrt(4^2 - 3^2) = 2 * sqrt(16-9) = 2 * sqrt(7) = sqrt(28).

The solution seems to be missing. However, the problem is to find A'B' = 2sqrt(7).

The provided options are:
A:√{15}米
B:2√{15}米
C:2√{17}米
D:不能计算

Since 2√7 is approximately equal to √28 ≈ 5.29. √15 ≈ 3.87 and 2√15 ≈ 7.74. and 2√17 ≈ 8.24. So D is the most likely answer

Final Answer: D
