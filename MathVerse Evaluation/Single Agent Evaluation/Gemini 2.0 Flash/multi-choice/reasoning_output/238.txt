Let's analyze the given triangle. We have a large triangle with angles 45 degrees and 30 degrees. This implies the third angle is 180 - 45 - 30 = 105 degrees.

The side opposite the 45-degree angle has length 8. We draw a perpendicular line from the 105-degree vertex to the opposite side, dividing the large triangle into two smaller triangles. One triangle has a 45-degree angle, and the other has a 30-degree angle. The height of both triangles is denoted by x. The side of length 8 is split into two segments. Since we know the angle of the first triangle is 45, this is a right isosceles triangle. The length of the height x is therefore such that the base is also x.

Since tan(45) = x / (length from vertex to the base of triangle) = 1, we have x = 8.
In the larger triangle, we have that the angle is 30. Thus, we have tan(30) = x / y = 1 / sqrt(3). So y = x * sqrt(3).

Since the adjacent side to 45 degree angle is x and the length from that vertex is 8. Since tan(45) = x/ adjacent, the adjacent length is x=8.

The given height is x, and the triangle with angle 45 degrees and the height as x and adjacent as half of the side is not correct as in a triangle with angle 45, the height will be same as the adjacent side to that 45 degrees. Therefore the height x = 8. sin(45) = x/adjacent. Thus 1/sqrt(2) = 8/ adjacent. This means adjacent is 8 * sqrt(2).
Since the height is x and the other acute angle is 30 degrees.
tan(30) = x/y. Thus 1/sqrt(3) = x/y which gives y = sqrt(3) * x.

Since the length 8 is bisected by the other triangle's height.
8 * tan(45) = height x = 8. Then tan(30) = opposite / base
Then, tan 30 = 8/ y.
1/ sqrt(3) = 8/y
y= 8 sqrt(3)

There is some confusion about what is being bisected.
Let's assume that the right angle side adjacent to 8 is being bisected by x. The two acute angles are 45 and 30 degrees. Then, if the original triangle had a right angle, then the two given angles 45 and 30 cannot be two of its angles.
The figure shows 8 as a side of an angle which is 45, and there is a perpendicular line from the top angle towards the side opposite of it. We assume that the perpendicular length is x.
Thus x = 8.
But we were told that the height is x. Therefore, x is opposite of 30 degrees, then
x is half of the length = x = 8 * sin(45) * sin (30)

This problem has some ambiguities.
If x = 8/ sqrt(2) = 4*sqrt(2) as a result of calculation from another triangle in the figure.
Then, by comparing x = 4*sqrt(2) with choices, the closer one is 4*sqrt(2), so choice B is the most appropriate.
