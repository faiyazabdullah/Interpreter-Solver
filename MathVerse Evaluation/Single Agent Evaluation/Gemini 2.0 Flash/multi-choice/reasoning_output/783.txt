Let the figure be denoted as ABCDEF, where the angle at vertex A is y, the angle at vertex B is x, the angle at vertex C is z, and the angle at vertex D is x. Also, angles E and F are present. We are given that x = 20 and y = 30. We need to find the value of z.

The figure consists of two triangles. Let's denote the triangle on the left as triangle ABE and the triangle on the right as triangle BCD.
In triangle ABE, the angles are y, x, and the angle at E. Let's call the angle at E as E. We have x = 20 and y = 30.
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
So, y + x + E = 180.
30 + 20 + E = 180
50 + E = 180
E = 180 - 50 = 130.

In triangle BCD, the angles are x, z, and the angle at D. We are given x = 20. Let the angle at D be denoted by D.
x + z + D = 180.
20 + z + D = 180.

However, we don't have enough information to directly find z.

We notice that the figure forms a quadrilateral. Let's consider the quadrilateral ABEFCD.  The sum of the exterior angles is 360. The two exterior angles are given as 30 and 20. Let angle E and D be the remaining angles.
If we let E be the interior angle at vertex E and F be the interior angle at vertex F. From before E = 130.
In triangle BCD, x + z + D = 180
20 + z + D = 180

We know x = 20 and y = 30.
The sum of interior angles in the whole figure can be found. We have 2x + y + z = some value.
There are no other constraints on this quadrilateral except that the sum of interior angles would be 360.
But we would also need to know about the remaining two angles on both sides, and without that information, we cannot obtain the angle z.
Let us try looking at the reflex angle at vertex B. Since y = 30, and x = 20, the angle between AB and the upward vertical direction is 30 degrees. Similarly, the angle between BD and horizontal angle is 20. Thus the overall angle should be y + x = 50. The angle at E = 130, hence the reflex angle at B is given by x+z.
The angle made by BE is 130. We cannot form any reasonable relationship to get z.

Since there isn't any relation specified and the quadrilateral is unusual, we consider that ABE and BCD could be regular or irregular triangles.
We will analyze the options given:
A. 60: If z = 60, then 20 + 60 + D = 180, so D = 100
B. 70: If z = 70, then 20 + 70 + D = 180, so D = 90
C. 80: If z = 80, then 20 + 80 + D = 180, so D = 80
D. 90: If z = 90, then 20 + 90 + D = 180, so D = 70
E. 100: If z = 100, then 20 + 100 + D = 180, so D = 60

Without more constraints, we cannot determine the value of z. The problem does not say the angles must sum to 360. Let's assume that triangles ABE and BCD are congruent.
In that case, D = 130. This would imply 20 + z + 130 = 180, so z = 30. This is not one of the answers.

Let's assume angle D=E. If this happens, then 2x+y+z < 360 degrees, so 40 + 30 + z = < 360 degree. Let's try z = 100, then total is 170. The exterior angle is (360-170).
However, there is not a reason to assume there's anything equal.
