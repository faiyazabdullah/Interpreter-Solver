QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the cross section of a tunnel is a semicircle with a radius of 3.4, and a truck with a width of 3.2 can pass through the tunnel.

CHOICES:
A:3m
B:3.4m
C:4m
D:2.8m

Let $r$ be the radius of the semicircle, so $r = 3.4$. Let $w$ be the width of the truck, so $w = 3.2$. Let $h$ be the height of the truck that can pass through the tunnel.
We can model this situation using the Pythagorean theorem. Consider a right triangle formed by the radius of the semicircle, half the width of the truck, and the distance from the center of the semicircle to the top of the truck.
The radius of the semicircle is the hypotenuse, so $r = 3.4$. Half the width of the truck is one leg of the right triangle, so $w/2 = 3.2/2 = 1.6$. Let $d$ be the distance from the center of the semicircle to the top of the truck. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have
$$(w/2)^2 + d^2 = r^2$$
$$(1.6)^2 + d^2 = (3.4)^2$$
$$2.56 + d^2 = 11.56$$
$$d^2 = 11.56 - 2.56$$
$$d^2 = 9$$
$$d = \sqrt{9} = 3$$
The height of the tunnel at the edge of the truck is $d = 3$. The radius of the semicircle is $3.4$. The height of the truck is the radius minus the distance from the center to the top of the truck, so $h = r - d = 3.4 - 3 = 0.4$. However, we want the maximum height of a truck with width 3.2 that can pass through the tunnel.

Let the height of the tunnel be $h$. Then $(w/2)^2 + (r-h)^2 = r^2$, where $w/2 = 1.6$ and $r = 3.4$. We have
$$(1.6)^2 + (3.4-h)^2 = (3.4)^2$$
$$2.56 + (3.4-h)^2 = 11.56$$
$$(3.4-h)^2 = 9$$
$$3.4-h = 3$$
$$h = 3.4-3 = 0.4$$
The height of the truck is $h = 0.4$. This is incorrect.
We need to find the maximum height of the truck.
Consider a point on the circle $(x,y)$ where $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$, so $x^2 + y^2 = (3.4)^2$. We want to find $y$ when $x = w/2 = 1.6$.
So $(1.6)^2 + y^2 = (3.4)^2$
$2.56 + y^2 = 11.56$
$y^2 = 9$
$y = 3$
The height of the tunnel at the edge of the truck is 3.
So the truck can pass through if its height is less than 3.
