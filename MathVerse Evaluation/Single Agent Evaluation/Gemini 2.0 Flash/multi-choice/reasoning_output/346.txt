The problem asks for the angle of elevation to point A from point C, which is labeled as x in the diagram.
We are given a right triangle with the side opposite to angle x having length 19, and the side adjacent to angle x having length 25.
We can use the tangent function to relate the angle x to the opposite and adjacent sides:
tan(x) = opposite / adjacent
tan(x) = 19 / 25
x = arctan(19/25)
x = arctan(0.76)
Using a calculator, we find:
x â‰ˆ 37.21 degrees
