Since AB is fixed, point D is also fixed. So, when CD is the largest, C, A, B, and D are on the same circle, that is, C is on the circle with AB as the base and angle ADB = 120°. When CD is largest, then angle ACB = 90°, let the center of the circle be O. So, angle AOB = 2 * 90 = 180. Angle ADB = 120°. The intersection of the circumcircles of right triangle ABC and equilateral triangle ABD is point A, so C, A, D, and B are concyclic. Extend BC to intersect the circumcircle of ABD at point C', then triangle ABC' is a right triangle. When C and C' coincide, the length of CD is maximum. So, quadrilateral ACBD is a cyclic quadrilateral. Angle ADB = 60. Then angle ACB = 180 - 60 = 120. But angle ACB = 90, which is impossible.

Let A(0,0), B(1,0). Let angle CAB = alpha, then C(cos(alpha), sin(alpha)). D = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). CD^2 = (cos(alpha)-1/2)^2 + (sin(alpha) - sqrt(3)/2)^2 = cos^2(alpha) - cos(alpha) + 1/4 + sin^2(alpha) - sqrt(3) sin(alpha) + 3/4 = 2 - cos(alpha) - sqrt(3)sin(alpha). To maximize this, minimize cos(alpha) + sqrt(3)sin(alpha) = 2(1/2 cos(alpha) + sqrt(3)/2 sin(alpha)) = 2 sin(alpha + 30). This is minimized when alpha + 30 = 270, so alpha = 240. This is impossible.

From another perspective, we are trying to find the largest value of CD. Since AB is fixed, then the position of D is fixed. C is a point on a circle with diameter AB.
Let AB = 1, angle CAB = theta. Then AC = cos(theta), BC = sin(theta). Coordinates are A(0,0), B(1,0), C(cos(theta), sin(theta)). D(1/2, sqrt(3)/2).
CD^2 = (cos(theta) - 1/2)^2 + (sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2)^2 = cos^2(theta) - cos(theta) + 1/4 + sin^2(theta) - sqrt(3) sin(theta) + 3/4 = 1 + 1 - cos(theta) - sqrt(3) sin(theta) = 2 - (cos(theta) + sqrt(3) sin(theta))
Then CD is maximized when cos(theta) + sqrt(3) sin(theta) is minimized.
cos(theta) + sqrt(3) sin(theta) = 2(1/2 cos(theta) + sqrt(3)/2 sin(theta)) = 2(sin(30)cos(theta) + cos(30) sin(theta)) = 2 sin(theta+30).
When theta + 30 = 270, then theta = 240. This is impossible.

We want to minimize cos(theta) + sqrt(3)sin(theta)
The minimum is -2, when sin(theta + 30) = -1, so theta + 30 = 270, so theta = 240
If we are finding the maximum value of CD, we need to minimize cos(alpha) + sqrt(3)sin(alpha) = 2sin(alpha + 30). Since 0 <= alpha <= 90, when alpha = 60, we can calculate that DC^2 = 0. This doesn't work either.
