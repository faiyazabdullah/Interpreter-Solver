QUESTION:
Sand has an angle of friction of about 40°. This means once it gets over this it slides down the side of the sand pile. Mae is getting a delivery of sand to her home, but the area where the sand will be delivered is only 10.6 metres wide. If h metres is the maximum height of the sandpile, find h to one decimal place.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The sandpile forms a triangle with a base of 10.6 m. The angle of friction is 40°, which means the angle between the base and the side of the triangle is 40°.
We can use trigonometry to find the height of the sandpile.
Since we have a right triangle with the base being half of 10.6 m, which is 5.3 m, and we have the angle 40°, we can use the tangent function to find the height h.
tan(40°) = h / 5.3
h = 5.3 * tan(40°)
h = 5.3 * 0.8391
h ≈ 4.44723
Rounded to one decimal place, h is approximately 4.4 m.
