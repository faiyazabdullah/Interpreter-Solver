QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the exponential function $y=4^{x}$. What can we say about the $y$-value of every point on the graph?

CHOICES:
A.The $y$-value of most points of the graph is greater than 1.
B.The $y$-value of every point on the graph is positive.
C.The $y$-value of every point on the graph is an integer.
D.The $y$-value of most points on the graph is positive, and the $y$-value at one point is 0.

The graph shows an exponential function $y=4^{x}$. We want to determine what can be said about the $y$-value of every point on the graph.

A. The $y$-value of most points of the graph is greater than 1. This statement is not true, as we can observe that for $x<0$, the $y$ values are between 0 and 1. For example, at $x = -1$, $y = 4^{-1} = 1/4$, which is less than 1.
B. The $y$-value of every point on the graph is positive. Since the base of the exponential function is positive, the function is always positive, so $y>0$ for all $x$.
C. The $y$-value of every point on the graph is an integer. This is not true, because if $x=0.5$, $y=4^{0.5}=\sqrt{4}=2$, which is an integer. But if $x=1.5$, $y=4^{1.5}=4^{3/2}=\sqrt{4^3}=\sqrt{64}=8$. So this is not always an integer. If we consider $x=0.1$, then $y=4^{0.1} \approx 1.1487$, which is not an integer.
D. The $y$-value of most points on the graph is positive, and the $y$-value at one point is 0. The $y$-value is never 0. The function value gets very close to zero as x tends to negative infinity, but does not ever attain the value zero.

Therefore, the correct statement is that the $y$-value of every point on the graph is positive.
