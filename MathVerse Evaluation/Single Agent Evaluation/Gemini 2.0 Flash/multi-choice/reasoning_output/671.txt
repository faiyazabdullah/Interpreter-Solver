QUESTION:
We want to find the surface area of this shape. Assume that both boxes are identical in size. The box has sides of length 25, 20 and 33. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11.

Let the dimensions of the box be $l=25$, $w=20$, and $h=33$.
The surface area of one box is $2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(25 \times 20 + 25 \times 33 + 20 \times 33) = 2(500 + 825 + 660) = 2(1985) = 3970$.
Since there are two identical boxes, the total surface area of the two boxes is $2 \times 3970 = 7940$.
However, the cylinders cut out parts of the boxes. The area of each circle is $\pi r^2$, where $r=6$. So, the area of each circle is $\pi (6^2) = 36\pi$.
Since there are two such circles, we subtract $2 \times 36\pi = 72\pi$ from the surface area.
The curved surface area of the cylinder is $2\pi r h$, where $r=6$ and $h=11$.
So the curved surface area of the cylinder is $2\pi (6)(11) = 132\pi$.
The total surface area is $7940 - 72\pi + 132\pi = 7940 + 60\pi$.
Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$, $60\pi \approx 60(3.14159) \approx 188.4954$.
So, the surface area of the solid is approximately $7940 + 188.50 = 8128.50$.

Now let's write out the argument and find the final answer.
Surface area of one box is $2(25 \times 20 + 25 \times 33 + 20 \times 33) = 2(500 + 825 + 660) = 2(1985) = 3970$.
Surface area of two boxes is $2 \times 3970 = 7940$.
Area of two circles is $2\pi r^2 = 2 \pi (6^2) = 72\pi$.
Surface area of the cylinder is $2\pi r h = 2\pi (6)(11) = 132\pi$.
Total surface area is $7940 - 2(36\pi) + 2\pi(6)(11) = 7940 - 72\pi + 132\pi = 7940 + 60\pi$.
$60\pi \approx 60 \times 3.14159 = 188.4954 \approx 188.50$.
Surface area is $7940 + 188.50 = 8128.50$.
