The problem states that angle AOB = 100 degrees. Angle AOB is a central angle subtended by arc AB. Angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc AB. If the central angle is less than 180 degrees, then angle ACB = (1/2) * angle AOB if C is on the major arc. Otherwise, angle ACB = 180 - (1/2) * angle AOB. In the diagram, point C is on the major arc. The central angle AOB = 100 degrees, which is less than 180 degrees. Thus, the inscribed angle ACB = (1/2) * AOB = (1/2) * 100 = 50 degrees if the point C is on the major arc. However, from the choices, none of the answers match 50.

If C is on the minor arc, the angle ACB = 180 - (1/2)*100 = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees.
