QUESTION:
There is a hyperbolic function with its center at the origin. The graph approaches zero as $∣x∣$ increases, and the function is undefined at x=0. There are four points labeled at (1/6,6), (6,1/6), (-1/6,-6), (-6,-1/6). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The problem asks for the domain and range of the given hyperbolic function.

From the graph, we can see that the function is undefined at x = 0. The function exists for all other values of x. So, the domain is all real numbers except 0.

The function approaches zero as $∣x∣$ increases. The function is undefined at y = 0. The function exists for all other values of y. So, the range is all real numbers except 0.

Using interval notation, the domain is $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$ and the range is $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$.

Since no answer choices are provided, it is not possible to select an answer.
