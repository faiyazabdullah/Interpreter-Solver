QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, Xiaodong uses a bamboo pole with a length of 3.2 as a measuring tool to measure the height of the school flagpole, and moves the bamboo pole so that the shadow on the top of the pole and the flag pole falls on the same point on the ground. At this time, the distance between the bamboo pole and this point is 8.0, and the distance from the flag pole is 22.0, then the height of the flag pole is ()

CHOICES:
A:12m
B:10m
C:8m
D:7m

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the height of the bamboo pole be $h_1 = 3.2$ meters, and its distance from the point on the ground where the shadows meet be $d_1 = 8$ meters.
Let the height of the flagpole be $h_2$ meters, and its distance from the same point on the ground be $d_2 = 8 + 22 = 30$ meters.

Since the bamboo pole and the flagpole cast shadows from the same light source, the triangles formed by the bamboo pole, its shadow, and the light ray, and the flagpole, its shadow, and the light ray are similar.
Therefore, the ratio of their heights is equal to the ratio of their distances from the point where the shadows meet:
$\frac{h_1}{d_1} = \frac{h_2}{d_2}$
$\frac{3.2}{8} = \frac{h_2}{30}$
$h_2 = \frac{3.2}{8} \times 30$
$h_2 = 0.4 \times 30$
$h_2 = 12$ meters

The height of the flagpole is 12 meters.
