QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function going through (0,-2), (-1,0), (2,0), (3,4), (-2,4). f(x)=x^2+x-6. How many roots do the functions have in common?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ and $g$ share the same root(s).
B:$f$ and $g$ share one root in common but each have another root that is not shared.
C:$f$ and $g$ share no roots in common.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The function g(x) has roots at x=-1 and x=2 since the graph crosses the x-axis at these two points.
The function f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 can be factored as f(x) = (x+3)(x-2). Therefore, the roots of f(x) are x = -3 and x = 2.
Comparing the roots of g(x) and f(x), we see that they share one root in common, which is x=2.
g(x) has a root at x=-1 which is not a root of f(x), and f(x) has a root at x=-3 which is not a root of g(x).

Therefore, f and g share one root in common but each have another root that is not shared.
