QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the radius of the circle.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

The circle's center is located at approximately (-4, -3). The circle intersects the y-axis at approximately -1 and -5.  Therefore, the radius is approximately 2. The circle intersects the x-axis at approximately -2 and -6. Therefore, the radius is approximately 2. Thus the radius is approximately 2.5.

If the center is (-4,-3) and the radius is r, the equation is (x+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = r^2.
From the graph, the x-intercepts are approximately -2 and -6. Let y = 0.
(x+4)^2 + 9 = r^2
(-2+4)^2 + 9 = r^2
4 + 9 = r^2
r^2 = 13
r = sqrt(13) which is approximately 3.6.

Let y = 0
(-6+4)^2 + 9 = r^2
4 + 9 = r^2
r^2 = 13
r = sqrt(13) which is approximately 3.6.
From the graph, the y-intercepts are approximately -1 and -5. Let x = 0.
(0+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = r^2
16 + (y+3)^2 = r^2
y = -1, then (y+3)^2 = (-1+3)^2 = 4.
16 + 4 = r^2
r^2 = 20
r = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5) which is approximately 4.47

y = -5, then (y+3)^2 = (-5+3)^2 = 4
16 + 4 = r^2
r^2 = 20
r = sqrt(20) = 2*sqrt(5) which is approximately 4.47

There appears to be a discrepancy with what I am seeing in the figure.  The circle appears to pass through (-2,0), (-6,0), (0,-1), and (0,-5).

The distance between (-2,0) and (-6,0) is 4, meaning the radius is at least 2.
The distance between (0,-1) and (0,-5) is 4, meaning the radius is at least 2.

The center looks like it's around (-4,-3). If the radius is sqrt(5), the equation becomes
(x+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 5.
When y = 0, (x+4)^2 = -4 which is impossible.

It is possible that the radius is 2.5.
(x+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = (2.5)^2 = 6.25
If y = 0, (x+4)^2 = 6.25 - 9 = -2.75 which is impossible.
It is clear the radius is sqrt(20) or ~4.47
