GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem asks us to find the total surface area of a cube with side length 6 cm.
A cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square.
The area of one face of the cube is side * side = 6 cm * 6 cm = 36 square cm.
Since there are 6 faces, the total surface area is 6 * 36 square cm = 216 square cm.
The information about the nine marked edges is irrelevant to the calculation of the surface area.
