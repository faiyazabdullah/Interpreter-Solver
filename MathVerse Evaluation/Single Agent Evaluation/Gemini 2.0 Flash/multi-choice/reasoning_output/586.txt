QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (0,0) and the value of y increases by the increase of the value of x, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The question asks whether the given graph has an inverse function. A function has an inverse function if and only if it is a one-to-one function, meaning that it passes the horizontal line test. This means that any horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. In the given graph, any horizontal line will intersect the curve at only one point. Thus, the function is one-to-one, and it has an inverse.

Final Answer: A
