Let $r_1$ be the radius of the top circle and $r_2$ be the radius of the bottom circle.
Given that the diameter of the top cone is 2 cm, so $r_1 = 1$ cm. The slant height of the top cone is $l_1 = 8$ cm.
The diameter of the bottom circle is 4 cm, so $r_2 = 2$ cm. The slant height of the frustum is $l_2 = 8$ cm.

The surface area of the frustum is the sum of the area of the top circle, the area of the bottom circle, and the lateral surface area of the frustum.
Area of the top circle is $A_1 = \pi r_1^2 = \pi (1)^2 = \pi$
Area of the bottom circle is $A_2 = \pi r_2^2 = \pi (2)^2 = 4\pi$
The lateral surface area of the frustum is given by $\pi (r_1 + r_2) l_2 = \pi (1 + 2)(8) = 24\pi$
The total surface area of the solid is $A = A_1 + A_2 + \pi (r_1 + r_2) l_2 = \pi + 4\pi + 24\pi = 29\pi$
$29\pi \approx 29 \times 3.14159265 = 91.10618685$
The surface area of the solid formed is $29\pi \approx 91.11 \text{ cm}^2$.

The diameter of the top cone is given as 2 cm, and in the problem, it is given as 8 cm. The diameter of the bottom circle is given as 4 cm, and in the problem, it is given as 4 cm. The slant height of the top cone is given as 8 cm, and the slant height of the frustum is given as 8 cm.
So, the radius of the top circle is $r_1 = 4$ cm.
The radius of the bottom circle is $r_2 = 2$ cm.  This appears to be an error, the top solid cone should have a diameter of 2cm, therefore the radius is 1cm. I will proceed with this.

The radius of the top cone is 1 cm and the radius of the bottom circle is 2 cm.
The surface area of the top circle is $A_1 = \pi r_1^2 = \pi (1^2) = \pi$
The surface area of the bottom circle is $A_2 = \pi r_2^2 = \pi (2^2) = 4\pi$
The lateral surface area of the frustum is $\pi(r_1+r_2)l = \pi(1+2)8 = 24\pi$
The total surface area of the solid formed is $A = A_1 + A_2 + \pi(r_1+r_2)l = \pi + 4\pi + 24\pi = 29\pi$
$29\pi = 29 \times 3.14159 \approx 91.106 \approx 91.11$
