The problem asks if the given graph has an inverse function.

A function has an inverse if and only if it is a one-to-one function. A one-to-one function is a function where each element of the range is associated with exactly one element of the domain.

For a line, being one-to-one means the line must be a non-horizontal line. The given line has a slope greater than 0, which means it is not a horizontal line. Therefore, it is a one-to-one function.
Hence, the function has an inverse function.

Final Answer: A
