QUESTION:
A suspension bridge is being built. The top of the concrete tower is 35.5 metres above the bridge and the connection point for the main cable is 65.9 metres from the tower.

Assume that the concrete tower and the bridge are perpendicular to each other.

If the length of the cable is h metres, find h to two decimal places.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The concrete tower and the bridge are perpendicular to each other, so we can form a right triangle with the tower, the bridge and the cable as sides. The tower has a length of 35.5 m and the bridge has a length of 65.9 m. We need to find the length of the cable (h), which is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

h^2 = (35.5)^2 + (65.9)^2
h^2 = 1260.25 + 4342.81
h^2 = 5603.06
h = sqrt(5603.06)
h â‰ˆ 74.85

Therefore, the length of the cable is approximately 74.85 metres.
