The diagram shows the points A, B, and C. The angle at A is given as 45 degrees and the angle at B is given as 37 degrees. However, the question states that angle A is 49 degrees and angle B is 41 degrees. I will use the angles provided in the question.
The angles of triangle ABC are A = 49 degrees and B = 41 degrees.  Therefore, angle C = 180 - 49 - 41 = 180 - 90 = 90 degrees.
The bearing of B from C is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction at C to the line joining C to B.
At point C, the south direction points directly down and the bearing from south to B is the same as the bearing from A to B, which is 180 degrees minus angle A from the north direction at A, so the bearing from A to B is 49 degrees relative to the north at A.
The angle between the south direction at C and the line CB is equal to angle B in the triangle, which is 41 degrees. The bearing from C to B is 180 - 90 + 41 degrees, 180 + (90-41) is measured clockwise from North. However, the north is at the top, then East direction is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, West is 270 degrees. Bearing from C to B measured from North clockwise is given by 90 - 41 = 49 degrees. Thus the bearing of B from C is 49 degrees.
The options provided are A. 053 ^\circ T, B. 082 ^\circ T, C. 045 ^\circ T, D. 037 ^\circ T.
The closest is option A. 053^\circ T. But using the diagram's values, and finding the angle at C to be 180-45-37 = 98. Then the bearing from C to B would be 90 - 37 = 53 degrees. Therefore, the answer is 053 ^\circ T
