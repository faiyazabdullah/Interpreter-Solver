QUESTION:
Quadratic function g opens upward, and goes through (2,4), (6,4) with a vertex of (4,0). Is the discriminant of f positive, zero, or negative?

CHOICES:
A:Positivie
B:Zero
C:Negative

The graph of the quadratic function f(x) intersects the x-axis at two points. The discriminant of a quadratic function determines the number of real roots. If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. If the discriminant is zero, there is one real root (a repeated root). If the discriminant is negative, there are no real roots.

The given graph shows that the quadratic function f(x) intersects the x-axis at two distinct points, meaning that the quadratic equation f(x) = 0 has two distinct real roots. Therefore, the discriminant of f is positive.

Final Answer: A
