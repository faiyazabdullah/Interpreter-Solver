QUESTION:
A piecewise function, with 2 segments constructed by a line passing (-5,1), (-3,2), and (-1,4) and a line passing (-1,5), (3,3), and (5,1), as shown in the figure. Let $f$ be the function given by the following graph. What is the domain of $f$?

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined.
From the graph, the piecewise function is defined for x-values ranging from -5 to 5.
The function starts at x = -5 with a closed circle, indicating that -5 is included in the domain.
At x = -3, there is an open circle, indicating that -3 is not included in the domain. However, the function is defined between -5 and -1, and it continues after x = -3, it has value at x = -3 in segment from x = -5 to x = -1.
At x = -1, there is an open circle at y = 4, indicating that this point is not included. However, there is also a closed circle at y = 5 for x = -1, meaning the function is defined at x = -1 with value y = 5.
From x = -1 to x = 5, the function continues. The function ends at x = 5 with a closed circle, indicating that 5 is included in the domain.
Therefore, the domain of the function is the interval [-5, 5].
The domain of f includes all real numbers from -5 to 5, inclusive.
