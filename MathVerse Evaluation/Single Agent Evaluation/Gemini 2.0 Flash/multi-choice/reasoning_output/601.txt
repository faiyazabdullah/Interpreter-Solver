We are asked to find the equation of the line in point-slope form. The general equation of a line in point-slope form is given by $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line.

We are given that the line passes through the points (2, -1), (5, 1), (8, 3), and (11, 5).
First, we need to find the slope of the line. We can choose any two points to calculate the slope. Let's use the points (2, -1) and (5, 1).
The slope, $m$, is given by the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.
Substituting the coordinates of the two points, we get $m = \frac{1 - (-1)}{5 - 2} = \frac{1 + 1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$.
Now that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$.
We can use any of the given points. Let's use the point (2, -1).
So, $y - (-1) = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$.
$y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$.
Thus, the equation of the line in point-slope form is $y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$.
