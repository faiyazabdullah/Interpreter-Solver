Let's analyze the given figure, which is composed of two rectangular prisms.
The top rectangular prism has dimensions 12cm, 1cm, and 1cm.
The bottom rectangular prism has dimensions 7cm, 4cm, and 1cm.

First, let's calculate the surface area of the top rectangular prism. The surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l=12cm, w=1cm, and h=1cm.
So, the surface area of the top prism is 2(12*1 + 12*1 + 1*1) = 2(12 + 12 + 1) = 2(25) = 50 cm^2.

Next, let's calculate the surface area of the bottom rectangular prism. The surface area is given by 2(lw + lh + wh), where l=4cm, w=1cm, and h=7cm.
So, the surface area of the bottom prism is 2(4*1 + 4*7 + 1*7) = 2(4 + 28 + 7) = 2(39) = 78 cm^2.

Now, we need to consider the overlapping area between the two prisms. The area of the overlap is a rectangle with dimensions 4cm x 1cm. The area of this rectangle is 4 * 1 = 4 cm^2. Since this area is present on both prisms, we need to subtract twice of this area from the sum of the surface areas. Thus, the reduction in area is 2 * 4 = 8 cm^2.

The total surface area of the combined figure is the sum of the surface areas of the two prisms minus the overlapping area:
50 + 78 - 8 = 128 - 8 = 120 cm^2.
