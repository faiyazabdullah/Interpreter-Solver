GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis, which is given as 0.5. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, which is given as 2.

We have two points on the line: (0.5, 0) and (0, 2).
We can use the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
Let (x1, y1) = (0.5, 0) and (x2, y2) = (0, 2)
m = (2 - 0) / (0 - 0.5)
m = 2 / (-0.5)
m = -4

The slope of the line is -4.
