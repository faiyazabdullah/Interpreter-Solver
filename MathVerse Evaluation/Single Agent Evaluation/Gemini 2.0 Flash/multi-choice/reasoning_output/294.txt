In parallelogram JKLM, ML = 45 and KL = 21. Since opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length, JK = ML = 45 and JM = KL = 21.
We are given that JK = 2b + 3 and JM = 3a. Therefore, 2b + 3 = 45 and 3a = 21.
From 2b + 3 = 45, we have 2b = 42, so b = 21.
From 3a = 21, we have a = 7.
We are given that angle KLM = 30 degrees + 70 degrees = 100 degrees.
In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Thus, angle JKL + angle KLM = 180 degrees.
So, angle JKL = 180 - 100 = 80 degrees.
Also, in a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Therefore, angle JML = angle JKL = 80 degrees and angle KJM = angle KLM = 100 degrees.
We are asked to find the measure of angle KJL.
Consider triangle JKL. The sides are JK = 45, KL = 21, and JL is unknown. Angle JKL = 80 degrees.
In the parallelogram, angle MLK = 70 degrees and angle JLM = 30 degrees. Also, angle KJL = angle LMK and angle JKL = angle MLJ. We want to find the value of angle KJL.
Since JK || ML, then angle KJL = angle JLM = 30 degrees.
Since JM || KL, then angle LKM = angle KMJ. Also, angle JKL = angle MLJ.
