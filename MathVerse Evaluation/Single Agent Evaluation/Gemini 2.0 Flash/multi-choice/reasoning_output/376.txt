GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given triangle is a right-angled triangle with one angle measuring 45^\circ. This implies that the other acute angle also measures 45^\circ, making the triangle an isosceles right-angled triangle. Therefore, the two legs of the triangle have equal length. One leg has length $4\sqrt{3}$. Thus, the other leg, which is $y$, also has the same length.

Therefore, $y = 4\sqrt{3}$.
