The image shows a rectangle divided into three smaller rectangles. The dimensions of the large rectangle are 6 by 1000 + 10 + something we need to calculate. We are given that the total area of the large rectangle is 6096. The area of the first rectangle is 6 * 1000 = 6000. The area of the second rectangle is 6 * 10 = 60. Let the width of the third rectangle be x. The area of the third rectangle is 6 * x. The total area is 6000 + 60 + 6x = 6096. Then 6060 + 6x = 6096. Subtracting 6060 from both sides gives 6x = 6096 - 6060 = 36. Then x = 36 / 6 = 6. The area of the third rectangle is 6 * 6 = 36. The white square is in the third rectangle. The diagram does not provide the dimensions of the white square. We don't have enough information to find the area remaining since we don't know the size of the white square.
Assuming the white square is not there, the total area is 6096.
If the white square has sides of length 1, the area is 1, and the remaining area is 6096 - 1 = 6095.
If the white square has sides of length 2, the area is 4, and the remaining area is 6096 - 4 = 6092.
If the white square has sides of length 3, the area is 9, and the remaining area is 6096 - 9 = 6087.
If the white square has sides of length 4, the area is 16, and the remaining area is 6096 - 16 = 6080.
The value of x=6 can be used to calculate the height and width of the unknown region, but we have no way to calculate the area of the white region.
