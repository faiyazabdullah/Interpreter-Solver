QUESTION:
Xuan Xuan and Kai Kai are in the same mathematics study group. In a math activity class, they each used a square piece of paper with a side length of 12.0 to make a pair of jigsaw puzzles, and cooperated to design the work shown in the picture. Help them calculate the sum of the area of the three figures circled in the figure, it is ()

CHOICES:
A:12cm
B:24cm
C:36cm
D:48cm

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The figure is made of a square with a side length of 12. The area of the square is 12 * 12 = 144.
The three figures circled are two small triangles and one small square.
The area of the square is half of the area of the large square, so the area is 144 / 2 = 72.
The two small triangles together form a square.
The side length of the small square is half the side length of the original square, so 12 / 2 = 6.
The area of the small square is 6 * 6 = 36. The small square in the tangram is half the area of the small square in the large square.
Therefore, the area of the square is half of that small square, so it is 36.
The sum of the two small triangles is 1/4 of the large square. 1/4 * 144 = 36.
Therefore, the sum of the areas of the two triangles and the square is the area of one of the squares in the dissection of the large square.
The two small triangles and the square form a square with side length 6. Area = 6 * 6 = 36.
Therefore the sum of the area of the three figures is 36.
