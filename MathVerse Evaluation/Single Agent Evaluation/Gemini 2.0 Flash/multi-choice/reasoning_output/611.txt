QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What does the average rate of change tell you?

CHOICES:
A:The number of earthquakes per year increased by 6 each year.
B:The number of earthquakes per year did not change.
C:There were a total of 6 earthquakes over the 4 years.
D:The number of earthquakes per year decreased by 6 each year.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows the number of earthquakes per year. The y-value is constant at 6 for each year from year 1 to year 4.
The average rate of change is the change in the number of earthquakes divided by the change in years.
Since the number of earthquakes is constant, the average rate of change is 0.
This means that the number of earthquakes per year did not change.
Answer choice A says "The number of earthquakes per year increased by 6 each year." This is not true.
Answer choice B says "The number of earthquakes per year did not change." This is true.
Answer choice C says "There were a total of 6 earthquakes over the 4 years." This is not true, since there were 6 earthquakes each year, so there were $6 \times 4 = 24$ earthquakes.
Answer choice D says "The number of earthquakes per year decreased by 6 each year." This is not true.

Final Answer: B
