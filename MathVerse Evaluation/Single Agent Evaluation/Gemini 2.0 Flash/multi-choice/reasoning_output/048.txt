According to the inscribed angle theorem, the inscribed angle is half of the central angle subtended by the same arc.
However, point A can be on the minor arc BC or the major arc BC.
When point A is on the major arc BC, the measure of angle BAC is half the measure of angle BOC, which is 100/2 = 50 degrees.
When point A is on the minor arc BC, angle BAC and angle BOC form an inscribed quadrilateral, and the opposite angles are supplementary. Thus, angle BAC + angle BOC = 180, so angle BAC = 180 - 100 = 80 degrees.

Looking at the figure, point A appears to be on the major arc BC. Thus, the measure of angle BAC is 50 degrees.

Final Answer: A
