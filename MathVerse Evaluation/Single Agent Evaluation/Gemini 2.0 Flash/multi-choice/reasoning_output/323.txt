QUESTION:
The diagram is a quadrilateral with intersecting diagonals and perpendicular to each other. Where AB=AD, BC=DC, and the length from D to the diagonal intersection point is 5, and the length from C to the diagonal intersection point is 12. Find B C.

CHOICES:
A:5
B:9
C:12
D:13

The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at a point, let's call it E. The diagonals are perpendicular. We are given that AB = AD and BC = DC. Also, DE = 5 and CE = 12. We want to find BC.

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, triangle DEC is a right triangle. We have DE = 5 and CE = 12. Then, by the Pythagorean theorem,
$DC^2 = DE^2 + CE^2 = 5^2 + 12^2 = 25 + 144 = 169$.
So $DC = \sqrt{169} = 13$.

Since BC = DC, we have BC = 13.

Now, let's compare our result with the answer choices.
A: 5
B: 9
C: 12
D: 13

Our calculated answer is 13, which matches choice D.

Final Answer: D
