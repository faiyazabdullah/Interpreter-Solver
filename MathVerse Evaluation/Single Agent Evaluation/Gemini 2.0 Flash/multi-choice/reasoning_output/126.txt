QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, it is known that the radius of the bottom surface of the cone is 6.0, and the length of the generatrix is ​​10.0, then the lateral area of ​​the cone is ()

CHOICES:
A:60π
B:80π
C:10π
D:96π

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The radius of the base of the cone is given as 6, and the length of the generatrix is given as 10. The lateral surface area of a cone is given by the formula πrl, where r is the radius of the base and l is the length of the generatrix. Therefore, the lateral surface area of the cone is π * 6 * 10 = 60π.
