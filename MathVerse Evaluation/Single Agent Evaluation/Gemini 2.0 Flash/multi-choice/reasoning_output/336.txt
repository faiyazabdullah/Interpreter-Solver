The angle between line OA and the north direction is 31°.
We need to find the true bearing of point A from O.

Since the angle is measured from the north direction towards the west, the bearing is 360° - x, where x is the angle between the north direction and the line OA.
However, the diagram indicates the point A is West of North.
Therefore, the true bearing of A from O is given by subtracting the angle from 360 degrees.

True bearing = 360° - (90°- (90° - (90° - 31)))
True bearing = 360° - (90° + 31°)

True bearing = 360° - (31°) = 329°
Or 31 degree west of north means the bearing is 360-31 degrees=329 degrees

Since no answer choices are provided, we cannot compare with the given answer choices. However, we derived that the bearing of point A from O is 329°.

Since no options are given, I cannot choose A, B, C, or D.
The angle is 31 degrees from North towards West. So the bearing is 360-31 = 329.
