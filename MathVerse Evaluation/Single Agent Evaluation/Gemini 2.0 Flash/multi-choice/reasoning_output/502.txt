QUESTION:
There is a cubic function that passes (0,0). Find the absolute maximum of the function.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph of the cubic function passes through (0, 0).
The graph appears to have a local maximum at approximately (-2, 10).
The graph appears to have a local minimum at approximately (2, -10).
The graph passes through (-3, 0), (0, 0), and (3, 0).
Since the function passes through (0,0), we are looking for the y value of the local maximum, which appears to be 10.
