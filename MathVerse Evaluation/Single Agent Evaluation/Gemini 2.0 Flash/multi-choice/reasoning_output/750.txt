QUESTION:
Consider the following figure. The base is a triangle with two side of the same length 10cm and one side of length 12cm. The height of the prism is 16cm.

The base of the triangular prism is a triangle with two sides of equal length (10 cm) and a base of 12 cm. We need to find the height *x* of this triangle using the Pythagorean theorem.

The height *x* bisects the base of the triangle, creating two right-angled triangles. Each of these right-angled triangles has a hypotenuse of 10 cm and a base of 6 cm (half of the 12 cm base).

Applying the Pythagorean theorem:
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where *a* = 6 cm, *b* = *x*, and *c* = 10 cm.
$6^2 + x^2 = 10^2$
$36 + x^2 = 100$
$x^2 = 100 - 36$
$x^2 = 64$
$x = \sqrt{64}$
$x = 8$ cm
