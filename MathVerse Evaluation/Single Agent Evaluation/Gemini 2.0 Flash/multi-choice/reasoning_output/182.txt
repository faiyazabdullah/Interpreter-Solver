Let $\angle OAB = \theta$. Then $\angle OBA = 180^\circ - 45^\circ - \theta = 135^\circ - \theta$.
Since $\angle ABC = 90^\circ$, we have $\angle CBO = 90^\circ - (135^\circ - \theta) = \theta - 45^\circ$.
Also, $\angle CAB = 90^\circ - \theta$. Thus $\angle OAC = \angle OAB + \angle BAC = \theta + 90^\circ$.

Since A and B move on OX and OY respectively, the distance OA is given by
$OA = AB \cos \angle OAB / \sin \angle AOB$.
So, $OA = 10 \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin 45^\circ} = 10 \sqrt{2} \cos \theta$.
We want to maximize $OA$, so we need to maximize $\cos \theta$. However, we have more information than we're using.
Consider point M, the midpoint of AB. Then $OM = AM = BM = AB/2 = 5$.
Now, rotate the entire triangle $ABC$ around the origin. The distance from O to A will vary, and the furthest distance from O to A will occur when A, O, and M are collinear. In this case, the distance from O to A is $OA = OM + MA = 5 + 5 = 5\sqrt{2}$.

Let M be the midpoint of AB. Then $OM \perp AB$.
Since $\angle AOB = 45^\circ$, we know that the perpendicular distance from O to AB is half the length of AB.
Since $\angle ABC=90^\circ$, consider the triangle. Let M be the midpoint of AB. Since M is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of triangle ABC, $AM = BM = CM = AB/2 = 5$.
Also $\angle OAB = 45$. Then $OA = AB \cos (\angle OAB)/ \sin (45^\circ)$.

However, the maximum value of OA happens when $\angle OAB = 0$.
Then $OA=AB \cos(0) / \sin (45) = 10/\sin(45^\circ) = 10 / (1/\sqrt(2)) = 10 \sqrt{2}$.
However this isn't the case as the question is confusing.
Let M be the midpoint of AB. Then $OM = \frac{AB}{\sqrt{2}} = AB\sin{\theta} $
When A,M,O are collinear, $OA = OM+ MA$ so $OA= AM(\sqrt2 +1 )$ which means 12. something
Since A and B move on OX and OY respectively, the maximum distance of point A from O would be obtained when $\angle ABO = 90^\circ$. In the case when triangle ABC is coinciding with triangle OBA, $\angle ABO = 90^\circ$ and $\angle AOB=45^\circ$, $\angle BAO = 45^\circ$ and AB = 10. We have a triangle OAB where angle ABO = 90, and thus OA = AB/cos 45 = $10 \sqrt{2}$.
