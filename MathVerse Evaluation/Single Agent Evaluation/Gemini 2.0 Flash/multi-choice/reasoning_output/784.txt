Let $C_L$ be the circumference of the large circle and $r_L$ be its radius. Let $r_S$ be the radius of the small circle.
We are given that $C_L = 36$ and $r_S = \frac{1}{2} r_L$.
We also know that $C_L = 2 \pi r_L$, so $36 = 2 \pi r_L$, which implies $r_L = \frac{36}{2 \pi} = \frac{18}{\pi}$.
Since $r_S = \frac{1}{2} r_L$, we have $r_S = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{18}{\pi} = \frac{9}{\pi}$.
The central angle of the darkened arc is $80^\circ$. To find the length of the darkened arc, we need to find the fraction of the circumference of the small circle that corresponds to the $80^\circ$ angle.
The fraction is $\frac{80^\circ}{360^\circ} = \frac{8}{36} = \frac{2}{9}$.
The circumference of the small circle is $C_S = 2 \pi r_S = 2 \pi \cdot \frac{9}{\pi} = 18$.
The length of the darkened arc is $\frac{2}{9} \cdot C_S = \frac{2}{9} \cdot 18 = 4$.
