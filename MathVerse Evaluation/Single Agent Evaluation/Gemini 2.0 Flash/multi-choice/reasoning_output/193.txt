QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, PA and PB are tangent to circle O at points A and B respectively, the tangent EF of circle O intersects PA and PB at points E and F respectively, and the tangent point C is on the arc AB. If the length of PA is 2.0, then the perimeter of triangle PEF is ()

CHOICES:
A:8
B:6
C:4
D:2

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Since PA and PB are tangent to circle O at points A and B respectively, PA = PB = 2.
EF is tangent to circle O at point C, intersecting PA and PB at points E and F respectively.
By the tangent segment theorem, EA = EC and FC = FB.
The perimeter of triangle PEF is PE + EF + PF = PE + EC + CF + PF = PE + EA + FB + PF = PA + PB = 2 + 2 = 4.
