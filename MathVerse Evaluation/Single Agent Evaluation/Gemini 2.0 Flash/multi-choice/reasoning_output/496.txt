QUESTION:
There is a quadratic function, which goes through (0,0), (20,0) and opens upward. Determine whether the graph represents a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A.This is a one-to-one function
B.This is not a one-to-one function

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given graph is a parabola that opens upwards. A one-to-one function is a function where each element of the range corresponds to exactly one element of the domain. Graphically, a function is one-to-one if it passes the horizontal line test, which means that any horizontal line drawn will intersect the graph at most once. In the given graph, we can see that a horizontal line can intersect the parabola at two points. For example, the horizontal line y = -5 intersects the parabola at two points. Therefore, the given graph does not represent a one-to-one function.

Final Answer: B
