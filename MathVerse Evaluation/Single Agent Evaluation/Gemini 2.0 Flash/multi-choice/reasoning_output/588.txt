QUESTION:
The graphs of logarithm function $f(x)=\ln x$ passing (1,4) and logarithm function $g(x)$ passing (1,0) are shown below. $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$.

Hence state the equation of $g(x)$.

The graph of $f(x) = \ln x$ passes through the point $(1, 0)$.
The graph of $g(x)$ appears to be a vertical translation of $f(x)$.
We are given that the function $f(x) = \ln x$. The graph of $f(x)$ passes through $(1,0)$. The graph of $g(x)$ is a vertical translation of $f(x)$.
From the given graph, $g(x)$ passes through approximately $(1,4)$. Since $f(1)=0$, we can see that $g(1)=4$.
Thus, we have $g(x) = f(x) + 4$, which means $g(x) = \ln x + 4$.

Now let's check if the $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are switched, and given we have the point (1,0) for g(x) and (1,4) for f(x). The current assignment is correct. Thus $g(x) = \ln x + 4$.
