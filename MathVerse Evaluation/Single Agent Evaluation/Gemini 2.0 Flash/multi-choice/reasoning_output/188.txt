QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, it is known that BA is the tangent of circle O, and connect OB to intersect circle O at point C. If angle B = 45.0 and the length of AB is 2.0, then the length of BC is ()

CHOICES:
A:2√{2}-1
B:√{2}
C:2√{2}-2
D:2-√{2}

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Since BA is tangent to circle O, we know that angle OAB = 90 degrees.
In triangle OAB, angle B = 45 degrees, so angle AOB = 180 - 90 - 45 = 45 degrees.
Therefore, triangle OAB is an isosceles right triangle, and OA = AB = 2.
Since OA is the radius of circle O, OC = OA = 2.
OB is the hypotenuse of right triangle OAB, so OB = OA * sqrt(2) = 2 * sqrt(2).
BC = OB - OC = 2 * sqrt(2) - 2.
So, the length of BC is 2 * sqrt(2) - 2.
Comparing with the options given:
A: 2√{2}-1
B: √{2}
C: 2√{2}-2
D: 2-√{2}

The calculated length of BC is 2√{2}-2, which matches option C.

Final Answer: C
