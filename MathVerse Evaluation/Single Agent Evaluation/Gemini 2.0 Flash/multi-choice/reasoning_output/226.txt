The hexagon U V W X Y Z is regular, meaning all its sides are equal in length and all its interior angles are equal. Each side is 12 cm long. We want to find the length of W Y.
Since U V W X Y Z is a regular hexagon, we can divide it into six equilateral triangles, each with side length 12 cm.
The line segment W Y connects two vertices that are separated by one vertex (X). The length of W Y can be found by considering the isosceles trapezoid W X Y Z.
Alternatively, consider the triangle formed by the center of the hexagon (call it O) and the vertices W and Y. The angle WOY is twice the angle formed by two adjacent vertices. In a regular hexagon, the angle formed by the center and two adjacent vertices is 360/6 = 60 degrees. So the angle WOY is 2*60 = 120 degrees. The sides OW and OY have length 12 (since each side is formed by the line joining center of hexagon to one of its vertices.)

To find W Y, we can consider the vertices W, X and Y. Angle WXY is an interior angle of the regular hexagon, so it is (n-2)*180/n = (6-2)*180/6 = 4*180/6 = 4*30 = 120 degrees.
Since the hexagon is regular, WX = XY = 12.
By the law of cosines in triangle WXY:
WY^2 = WX^2 + XY^2 - 2*WX*XY*cos(WXY)
WY^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 - 2*12*12*cos(120)
WY^2 = 144 + 144 - 2*144*(-1/2)
WY^2 = 288 + 144
WY^2 = 432
WY = sqrt(432) = sqrt(144*3) = 12*sqrt(3)
