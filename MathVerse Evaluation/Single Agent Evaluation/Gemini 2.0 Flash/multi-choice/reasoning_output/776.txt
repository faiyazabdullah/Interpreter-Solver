QUESTION:
In the figure above. The graph consists of four lines l,m,n,p intersecting each other. Line l and line p are perpendicular. If the angle (not shown) where lines n and p intersect is twice as large as the angle (also not shown) where lines l and m intersect, what is the value of x?

Let $\alpha$ be the angle where lines $l$ and $m$ intersect.
Let $\beta$ be the angle where lines $n$ and $p$ intersect.
We are given that $\beta = 2\alpha$.

We are given that line $l$ and line $p$ are perpendicular, so the angle between them is $90^\circ$.
We are given that the angle between lines $n$ and $p$ is $110^\circ$. This means that $\beta = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ$. Thus, $\beta = 70^\circ$.

Since $\beta = 2\alpha$, we have $70^\circ = 2\alpha$. Thus, $\alpha = 35^\circ$.

The sum of the angles in the quadrilateral is $360^\circ$. The angles are $x$, $90^\circ$, $110^\circ$ and the angle between $l$ and $m$ is $\alpha = 35^\circ$.
However, these are exterior angles. So,
$x + 90^\circ + 110^\circ + \alpha = 360^\circ$ is not relevant.

Consider the quadrilateral formed by the four lines. The angles where $l$ and $p$ intersect is $90^\circ$. The angle where $n$ and $p$ intersect is $110^\circ$. We are given that the angle between $l$ and $m$ is $\alpha$, and the angle between $n$ and $p$ is $\beta = 2\alpha$. We have $\alpha = 35^\circ$, so the angle between $l$ and $m$ is $35^\circ$.
The angle we are trying to find is $x$.

Consider the triangle formed by lines $l, m, p$.
One angle is $90^\circ$. The angle between $m$ and $l$ is $\alpha = 35^\circ$. So the angle where $m$ and $p$ intersect is $180 - 90 - 35 = 55^\circ$.

Consider the quadrilateral formed by the intersections of the lines. The angles between $l$ and $p$ is $90^\circ$. The angle between $n$ and $p$ is $110^\circ$. Let the intersection of lines $l$ and $n$ form angle $\theta$. The sum of the interior angles is 360, so $90 + 110 + x + \theta = 360$. However, we don't know what $\theta$ is.

Let's use the angles on a straight line. The angle between $p$ and $n$ is $110^\circ$. The supplementary angle is $180 - 110 = 70^\circ$.
Since $2\alpha = 70^\circ$, then $\alpha = 35^\circ$. The angle is $x$.

In the quadrilateral formed, we have angles $90$, $70$, the angle between $l$ and $n$ (call it $\theta$) and $x$.
So $90 + 70 + \theta + x = 360$. But we need to solve for $x$.

Look at the triangle formed by the lines. Let's solve for the missing angle using the angles of a triangle. We have $x$ and $35$.
$x + 35 + y = 180$. The lines are labeled l, m, n, p.

Since $\beta = 70$, then $110$ is adjacent to it. $35+90+x=180$
