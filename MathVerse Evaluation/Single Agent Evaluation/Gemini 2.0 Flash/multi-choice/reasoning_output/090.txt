The problem asks for the measure of angle ACB, given that angle AOB is 50 degrees. Angle AOB is a central angle, and angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc AB.
According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its corresponding central angle if they subtend the same arc.
Therefore, angle ACB = (1/2) * angle AOB = (1/2) * 50 degrees = 25 degrees.
