The figure shows a regular octagon with a distance of 6 cm from the center to each vertex. This distance is the radius of the circumscribed circle.
To find the area of the regular octagon, we can divide it into 8 congruent isosceles triangles, each with a vertex at the center of the octagon.
The angle at the center of each triangle is 360/8 = 45 degrees.
The area of one triangle can be calculated as (1/2) * a * b * sin(C), where a and b are the sides adjacent to angle C. In this case, a = b = 6 cm, and C = 45 degrees.
Area of one triangle = (1/2) * 6 * 6 * sin(45) = (1/2) * 36 * (sqrt(2)/2) = 18 * (sqrt(2)/2) = 9 * sqrt(2) ≈ 9 * 1.414 ≈ 12.726 cm^2
Since there are 8 triangles, the total area of the octagon is 8 * 12.726 ≈ 101.808 cm^2.
Rounding to the nearest tenth, the area is 101.8 cm^2.
