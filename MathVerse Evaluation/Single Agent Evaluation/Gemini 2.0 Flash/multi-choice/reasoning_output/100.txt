From the problem, we know that AB is the diameter of circle O, CD is a chord, and AB is perpendicular to CD at point E. Also, angle BOC = 30 degrees. We need to find the degree of angle BAD.
Since AB is perpendicular to CD, E is the midpoint of CD. That is, CE = DE. Therefore, arc BC = arc BD.
Angle BAD is the inscribed angle corresponding to arc BD, and angle BOC is the central angle corresponding to arc BC.
According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, angle BAD = (1/2) * angle BOD. Since arc BC = arc BD, angle BOC = angle BOD = 30 degrees.
So, angle BAD = (1/2) * 30 degrees = 15 degrees.
