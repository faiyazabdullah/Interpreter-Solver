GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The semicircle passes through (-7, 0), (-5, 5), (0, 7), (5, 5), (7, 0).
Since the semicircle passes through (-7, 0) and (7, 0), the center must lie on the y-axis. Let the center be (0, y).
The radius of the semicircle is the distance from the center to any point on the semicircle.
Let's consider the point (7, 0). The radius is then $\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (0-y)^2} = \sqrt{49 + y^2}$.
Let's consider the point (0, 7). The radius is then $\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (7-y)^2} = \sqrt{(7-y)^2} = |7-y|$.
Then $\sqrt{49 + y^2} = |7-y|$.
Squaring both sides, we have $49 + y^2 = (7-y)^2 = 49 - 14y + y^2$.
Then $49 + y^2 = 49 - 14y + y^2$, so $0 = -14y$.
Thus $y = 0$.
Then the center is (0, 0).
However, the point (0, 7) is on the semicircle, which means the radius is 7. Also, the points (7, 0) and (-7, 0) are on the semicircle, and their distance from (0, 0) is 7. So the radius is 7 and the center is (0, 0). But this doesn't match the other points.

Let's try the point (5, 5). The radius is $\sqrt{(5-0)^2 + (5-y)^2} = \sqrt{25 + (5-y)^2}$.
If the radius is $\sqrt{49 + y^2}$, then $\sqrt{25 + (5-y)^2} = \sqrt{49 + y^2}$.
Squaring both sides, we get $25 + 25 - 10y + y^2 = 49 + y^2$.
$50 - 10y + y^2 = 49 + y^2$.
$50 - 10y = 49$, so $1 = 10y$ and $y = \frac{1}{10}$.
This doesn't seem right.

The center must lie on the y-axis, say (0, y).
The radius is the distance from the center to any of the points. So the radius must be the same for all points.
Radius $r = \sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (0-y)^2} = \sqrt{49 + y^2}$.
Radius $r = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (7-y)^2} = |7-y|$.
Therefore, $|7-y| = \sqrt{49 + y^2}$.
Squaring both sides, we get $(7-y)^2 = 49 + y^2$.
$49 - 14y + y^2 = 49 + y^2$.
So $-14y = 0$, and $y = 0$. But the radius is then 7.
The point (-5, 5) must satisfy the radius of 7 if the center is (0, 0).
The distance from (-5, 5) to (0, 0) is $\sqrt{(-5)^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{25 + 25} = \sqrt{50} = 5\sqrt{2} \neq 7$.
So the center is not (0, 0).

Looking at the graph, the x-coordinate of the center seems to be 0.
The center is (0, k) for some k.
The radius squared is then $(x-0)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.
For (7, 0), $49 + (0-k)^2 = r^2$, so $49 + k^2 = r^2$.
For (0, 7), $(0-0)^2 + (7-k)^2 = r^2$, so $49 - 14k + k^2 = r^2$.
Then $49 + k^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2$, so $0 = -14k$, and $k = 0$.
Again, this doesn't work.

The maximum y-value appears to be around 7.
Visually, the center of the circle looks like it is (0, 0).
Then the equation of the circle would be $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$.
Since the circle goes through (7, 0), $49 + 0 = r^2$, so $r = 7$.
So $x^2 + y^2 = 49$.
Consider (-5, 5). $(-5)^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 25 = 50 \neq 49$.
The center cannot be (0,0).
Visually, it looks like it is close to (0, 0).
The center is (0, y). We are looking for the y coordinate of the center. Since it is symmetric around the y axis, the center of the semi circle seems to be at the origin. (0,0)
