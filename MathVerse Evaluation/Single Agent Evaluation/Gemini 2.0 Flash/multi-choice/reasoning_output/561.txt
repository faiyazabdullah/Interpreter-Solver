The question asks about the discriminant of the quadratic function g. We are given that the function opens downward and passes through the points (4, -5) and (8, -5), with a vertex at (6, -1).
The discriminant of a quadratic function $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ is given by $b^2 - 4ac$. The discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation.
If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.
If the discriminant is zero, the quadratic equation has one real root (a repeated root).
If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic equation has no real roots (two complex roots).
In the context of the graph of a quadratic function, the roots are the x-intercepts.
Since the vertex is at (6, -1) and the parabola opens downwards, the maximum value of the function is -1. Since the function passes through (4, -5) and (8, -5), the y-values are always less than or equal to -1. Therefore, the graph intersects the x-axis, meaning that the roots are real numbers. Since the points (4,-5) and (8,-5) are symmetric about the vertex x=6, and the function goes through (6,-1), it follows that there are two real roots (x-intercepts). If the roots are two distinct real numbers, then the discriminant must be positive.
