Since AB is the diameter of circle O, then ∠ACB = 90°. Also, ∠AOC = 126°, so ∠BOC = 180° - ∠AOC = 180° - 126° = 54°.
Then ∠BAC = ∠BOC / 2 = 54° / 2 = 27°.
In right triangle ABC, we have ∠ABC = 90° - ∠BAC = 90° - 27° = 63°.
Since ∠ADC and ∠ABC are supplementary angles, we have ∠ADC = 180° - ∠ABC = 180° - 63° = 117°.
Since AB is the diameter of circle O, the inscribed angle ∠ACB = 90°.
We are given that ∠AOC = 126°. Then the arc AC corresponds to a central angle of 126°, so the inscribed angle ∠ABC = 126°/2 = 63°.
∠BOC = 180° - 126° = 54°.
The inscribed angle ∠BAC = 54°/2 = 27°.
Since AB is the diameter, ∠ACB = 90°.
Therefore, ∠ABC = 90° - 27° = 63°.
Since A, C, B, D are on the circle, quadrilateral ACBD is a cyclic quadrilateral, so ∠CDB + ∠CAB = 180°, therefore, ∠CDB = 180° - (180°-126°)/2 = 180° - 54/2 = 180°-27°
Alternatively, we can use the property that ∠CDB = ∠CAB, and ∠CAB = (180-126)/2=(54)/2=27.

Another approach:
Since ∠AOC = 126°, we have ∠BOC = 180° - 126° = 54°.
Since ∠CDB is the inscribed angle subtended by arc BC, and ∠BOC is the central angle subtended by arc BC, then ∠CDB = (1/2) * ∠BOC = (1/2) * 54° = 27°.
