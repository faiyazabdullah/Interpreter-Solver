GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
We are given a right-angled triangle with one acute angle of 60 degrees and one leg with a length of 11. We are asked to find the length of the hypotenuse, labeled as 'w'. Since we know one angle is 60 degrees, and one is 90 degrees, the third angle must be 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees. The side with length 11 is opposite to the 90-degree angle, so it is adjacent to the 60-degree angle.

We can use the cosine function to relate the adjacent side and the hypotenuse:

cos(60^\circ) = adjacent / hypotenuse
cos(60^\circ) = 11 / w

Since cos(60^\circ) = 1/2, we have:

1/2 = 11 / w

Multiplying both sides by 2w, we get:

w = 2 * 11
w = 22
