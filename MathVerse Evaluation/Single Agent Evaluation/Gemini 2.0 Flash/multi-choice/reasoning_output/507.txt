QUESTION:
Which of the following could be the equation of the graphed line, whose y-intercept is 3 and x-intercept is -8?

CHOICES:
A.$3 x-8 y=24$
B.$3 x-8 y=-24$
C.$3 x+8 y=24$
D.$3 x+8 y=-24$

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The y-intercept is 3, which means the line passes through the point (0, 3). The x-intercept is -8, which means the line passes through the point (-8, 0).
We can find the slope of the line using these two points:
slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (3 - 0) / (0 - (-8)) = 3 / 8.

The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
In this case, m = 3/8 and b = 3, so the equation is y = (3/8)x + 3.

Multiplying both sides by 8, we get 8y = 3x + 24.
Rearranging the equation, we get 3x - 8y = -24.

Comparing this equation with the answer choices:
A. $3x - 8y = 24$
B. $3x - 8y = -24$
C. $3x + 8y = 24$
D. $3x + 8y = -24$

The equation we derived, 3x - 8y = -24, matches answer choice B.

Final Answer: B
