QUESTION:
The graph, which is a piecewise function and passes through the origin, shows Bart's speed while he is competing in a walking race, the x-axis representing Time and the y-axis representing Speed. Which situation corresponds to the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Bart increases his speed for the first half of the race and then slows in the second half
B:Bart starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed
C:Bart starts off at a constant speed and then increases his speed at a steady rate
D:Bart increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows Bart's speed over time.
From the origin, the speed increases. Then the speed decreases.
Option A says Bart increases his speed for the first half of the race and then slows in the second half. This corresponds to the graph.
Option B says Bart starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed. This does not correspond to the graph, because the graph shows the speed decreasing at the end.
Option C says Bart starts off at a constant speed and then increases his speed at a steady rate. This does not correspond to the graph, because the graph starts at 0.
Option D says Bart increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race. This does not correspond to the graph, because the graph shows the speed decreasing at the end.

Final Answer: A
