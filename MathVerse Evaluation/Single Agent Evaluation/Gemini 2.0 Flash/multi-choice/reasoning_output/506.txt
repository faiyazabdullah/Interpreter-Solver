GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph is a transformation of the absolute value function f(x) = |x|. The vertex of the absolute value function is at (0, 0), but in the given graph, the vertex is at (3, 3).
This means the function has been shifted 3 units to the right and 3 units upwards.
The general form of the transformed absolute value function is g(x) = a|x - h| + k, where (h, k) is the vertex.
In this case, h = 3 and k = 3, so the function becomes g(x) = a|x - 3| + 3.
We can also see that the graph passes through the points (2, 2) and (4, 2). We can use one of these points to find the value of 'a'. Let's use the point (2, 2).
2 = a|2 - 3| + 3
2 = a|-1| + 3
2 = a(1) + 3
2 = a + 3
a = 2 - 3
a = -1

Therefore, the equation of the transformed function is g(x) = -|x - 3| + 3.

The graph shown is indeed the graph of g(x) = -|x - 3| + 3.
The vertex is at (3, 3).
When x = 2, g(2) = -|2 - 3| + 3 = -|-1| + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2.
When x = 4, g(4) = -|4 - 3| + 3 = -|1| + 3 = -1 + 3 = 2.

The piecewise function can be written as:
g(x) = - (x - 3) + 3 = -x + 3 + 3 = -x + 6, if x < 3
g(x) = -(-(x - 3)) + 3 = x - 3 + 3 = x, if x >= 3

Therefore, the piecewise function is:
g(x) = -x + 6, if x < 3
g(x) = x, if x >= 3
