QUESTION:
The figure shows three parallel horizontal lines, with a diagonal line running through them on the left and a vertical line on the right. The diagonal line on the left intersects with three horizontal lines, with a length of 2x+6 for the lower section and 20-5x for the upper section. The vertical line on the right intersects with three horizontal lines, with a length of y for the upper section and 3/5y+2 for the lower section. The two short line segments cut by the left line are of equal length, and the two short line segments cut by the right line are of equal lengthFind y.

CHOICES:
A:3
B:4.5
C:5
D:6

Since the three horizontal lines are parallel, the ratios of corresponding segments on the two transversals must be equal. In other words, the ratio of the segment with length 20 - 5x to the segment with length 2x + 6 must be equal to the ratio of y to (3/5)y + 2. Also, the segments with lengths 20 - 5x and 2x + 6 must be equal.

So,
20 - 5x = 2x + 6
20 - 6 = 2x + 5x
14 = 7x
x = 2

Now, we have the equation:
y = (3/5)y + 2

Subtract (3/5)y from both sides:
y - (3/5)y = 2
(5/5)y - (3/5)y = 2
(2/5)y = 2

Multiply both sides by 5/2:
y = 2 * (5/2)
y = 5

The value of y is 5.
