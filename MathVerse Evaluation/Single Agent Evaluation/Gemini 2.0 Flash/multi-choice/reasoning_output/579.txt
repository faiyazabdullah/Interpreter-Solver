QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

Which of the following could model the percentage that Lucy can still recall after $t$ days?

CHOICES:
A:$Q=(0.85)^{t}$
B:$Q=(0.83)^{t}$
C:$Q=(0.87)^{t}$

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem states that Maximilian forgets 15% of what he could recall the day before, which means he remembers 85% (0.85) of what he remembered the previous day. The gray curve represents Maximilian's recall percentage, which can be modeled by $(0.85)^t$. Lucy's recall percentage is represented by the black curve, and we need to find a similar model for Lucy.

The black curve is slightly above the gray curve, indicating that Lucy's recall is a bit better than Maximilian's. This means that Lucy remembers a slightly higher percentage each day compared to Maximilian's 85%. Therefore, we're looking for a value slightly greater than 0.85.

Comparing the answer choices:
A: $Q=(0.85)^{t}$ - This matches Maximilian's recall.
B: $Q=(0.83)^{t}$ - This is lower than Maximilian's recall.
C: $Q=(0.87)^{t}$ - This is higher than Maximilian's recall, which fits the description of Lucy's recall being slightly better.

Since the black curve is slightly above the gray curve, it indicates that Lucy remembers a slightly larger percentage of the content as time passes. So, the value in the formula should be slightly bigger than 0.85. Between the provided answer choices, the only answer greater than 0.85 is 0.87. Thus, the answer is (0.87)^t.

Final Answer: C
