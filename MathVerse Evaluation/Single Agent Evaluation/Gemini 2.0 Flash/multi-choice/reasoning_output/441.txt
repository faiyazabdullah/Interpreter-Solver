The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

We are asked to find the value of $\sin a$.

Since the point $P$ is on the terminal side of the angle $a$ in standard position, and the circle is centered at the origin with radius 1, the coordinates of point $P$ are given by $(\cos a, \sin a)$.

Therefore, we have $\cos a = \frac{3}{5}$ and $\sin a = \frac{4}{5}$.

Thus, the value of $\sin a$ is $\frac{4}{5}$.

Since there are no answer choices given, we cannot compare our result to the provided choices. However, we have determined the value of $\sin a$ to be $\frac{4}{5}$.
