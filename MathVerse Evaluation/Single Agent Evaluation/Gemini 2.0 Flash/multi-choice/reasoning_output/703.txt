QUESTION:
The dimensions of a trapezoidal prism are given in the following diagram (not drawn to scale). A trapezoidal prism consists of two trapezium faces and four rectangular faces. The trapezium face has edges of 10cm, 5cm and 18cm and height of 3cm. The bottom face has edges of 18cm and 8cm.

Find the surface area of the trapezoidal prism.

The surface area of the trapezoidal prism is calculated by finding the areas of all its faces and adding them together.
The prism has two trapezoidal faces and four rectangular faces.
The area of each trapezoid is given by:
Area = (1/2) * (sum of parallel sides) * height
Area = (1/2) * (10 + 18) * 3
Area = (1/2) * 28 * 3
Area = 14 * 3
Area = 42 cm^2
Since there are two trapezoids, the total area of the trapezoidal faces is 2 * 42 = 84 cm^2

The rectangular faces have the following dimensions:
Rectangle 1: 18 cm x 8 cm, Area = 18 * 8 = 144 cm^2
Rectangle 2: 10 cm x 8 cm, Area = 10 * 8 = 80 cm^2
Rectangle 3: 5 cm x 8 cm, Area = 5 * 8 = 40 cm^2
Rectangle 4: 5 cm x 8 cm, Area = 5 * 8 = 40 cm^2

The total area of the rectangular faces is: 144 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 304 cm^2

The total surface area of the trapezoidal prism is the sum of the areas of the two trapezoids and the four rectangles:
Total surface area = 84 + 304 = 388 cm^2
