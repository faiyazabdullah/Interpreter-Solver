QUESTION:
In the figure, four rays intersect and form 16 angles, and two upright rays are parallel. m \angle 3 = 110 and m \angle 12 = 55. Find the measure of \angle 1.

CHOICES:
A:55
B:110
C:125
D:135

Since m∠3 = 110, then m∠4 = 180 - 110 = 70.
Since the upright rays are parallel, then ∠4 and ∠12 are corresponding angles.
However, m∠4 = 70, and m∠12 = 55, which means that the horizontal lines are not parallel.
Therefore, corresponding angles are not equal.
Let the line intersecting angles 3 and 4 be L1.
Let the line intersecting angles 1 and 2 be L2.
Let the line intersecting angles 11 and 12 be L3.
Since the upright rays are parallel, the angle corresponding to ∠12 will be equal to ∠8, and ∠4.
Since ∠3 and ∠7 are corresponding angles and the upright rays are parallel, then m∠7 = 110.
∠7 and ∠8 are supplementary, so m∠8 = 180 - 110 = 70.
Now, let's consider the angles at the line intersecting angles 9 and 10.
∠12 = 55. Since the upright rays are parallel, then ∠6 must be equal to ∠12, because they are corresponding angles.
m∠6 = 55. ∠5 and ∠6 are supplementary, so m∠5 = 180 - 55 = 125.
Since the upright rays are parallel, ∠1 and ∠5 are corresponding angles. Therefore, m∠1 = m∠5.
Thus, m∠1 = 125.
