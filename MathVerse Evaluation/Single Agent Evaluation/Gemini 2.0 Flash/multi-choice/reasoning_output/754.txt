QUESTION:
In the figure above, there is a triangle and two line segments in the figure, and the angle formed by the two segments is x. The two angles labeled in the figure are 55° and 75° respectively. What is the value of x?

CHOICES:
A.35
B.40
C.50
D.65
E.130

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the triangle on the left be triangle A, and the triangle on the right be triangle B.
The angle adjacent to the 55° angle in triangle A is 180°-55° = 125°.
The angle adjacent to the 75° angle in triangle B is 180°-75° = 105°.
The angle x is formed at the intersection of the two lines.
The sum of angles around a point is 360°.
The angle opposite to x is equal to x.
Therefore, x + 125° + 105° = 360°
x = 360° - 125° - 105°
x = 360° - 230°
x = 130°

Final Answer: E
