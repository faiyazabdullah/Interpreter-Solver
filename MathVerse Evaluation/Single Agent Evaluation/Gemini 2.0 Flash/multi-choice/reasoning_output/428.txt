QUESTION:
The logo of a shop consists of five semicircles; four small semicircles each with the same radius, and one large semicircle. The perimeter of the whole shape is 14\pi  units.
The entire shape is to be enlarged by a factor of 5 to form a logo sticker on the window of a shop front. What area of the shop front window will the sticker take up?

Let $r$ be the radius of each of the four small semicircles. Then the radius of the large semicircle is $2r$.
The perimeter of the whole shape is the sum of the lengths of the arcs of the semicircles.
The length of the arc of each small semicircle is $\pi r$, so the total length of the arcs of the four small semicircles is $4\pi r$.
The length of the arc of the large semicircle is $\pi (2r) = 2\pi r$.
The perimeter of the whole shape is $4\pi r + 2\pi r = 6\pi r$.
We are given that the perimeter is $14\pi$, so $6\pi r = 14\pi$.
Dividing both sides by $\pi$, we get $6r = 14$, so $r = \frac{14}{6} = \frac{7}{3}$.
The radius of the large semicircle is $2r = \frac{14}{3}$.
The area of the large semicircle is $\frac{1}{2} \pi (2r)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (\frac{14}{3})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{196}{9} = \frac{98\pi}{9}$.
The area of each small semicircle is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (\frac{7}{3})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{49}{9} = \frac{49\pi}{18}$.
The total area of the four small semicircles is $4 \times \frac{49\pi}{18} = \frac{98\pi}{9}$.
The area of the entire shape is the area of the large semicircle minus the area of the four small semicircles. Since these two areas are equal, the area of the shape is
Area of the large semicircle - 2 * Area of the small circles = $\frac{98\pi}{9} - 2(\frac{49\pi}{18}) = \frac{98\pi}{9} - \frac{49\pi}{9} \times 2/2=0$. This is wrong. The area of the shape is the area of the large semicircle minus the combined area of the two internal semicircles.

However, we are asked for the area of the sticker after the shape is enlarged by a factor of 5.
Let the original area be $A$. Then when the figure is enlarged by a factor of 5, the area is enlarged by a factor of $5^2 = 25$.
So the new area is $25A$.
$A = \frac{98\pi}{9} - 2 \times (\frac{1}{2} \pi (\frac{7}{3})^2) = \pi (\frac{98}{9} - \frac{49}{9}) = \frac{49\pi}{9}$.
The new area is $25 \times \frac{49\pi}{9} = \frac{1225\pi}{9}$.
If $\pi = 3$, then the new area is about 400.

Let $r$ be the radius of the small semicircles. The perimeter is $4 \pi r + 2\pi r = 6\pi r = 14\pi$. So $r = \frac{14}{6} = \frac{7}{3}$.
The radius of the big circle is $2r = \frac{14}{3}$. The area is then $\frac{1}{2} \pi (2r)^2 - 2(\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2) = \frac{1}{2} \pi(4r^2) - \pi r^2 = 2 \pi r^2 - \pi r^2 = \pi r^2 = \pi(\frac{7}{3})^2 = \frac{49\pi}{9}$.
When enlarged by a factor of 5, the area is scaled by a factor of $5^2 = 25$.
So the new area is $25(\frac{49\pi}{9}) = \frac{1225\pi}{9}$.
