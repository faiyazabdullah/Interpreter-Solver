State the equation of the circle shown in the graph.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The circle appears to have its center at (1, -4). The radius of the circle appears to be 3.

The equation of a circle with center (h, k) and radius r is given by:
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2

In this case, the center is (1, -4) and the radius is 3.
So the equation of the circle is:
(x - 1)^2 + (y - (-4))^2 = 3^2
(x - 1)^2 + (y + 4)^2 = 9

Final Answer: A
