QUESTION:
The Cosine function is graphed. It passes through (0,1), (90,0), (180,-1), (270,0), and (360,1). It is symmetric about the y-axis. A black vertex labeled on the function at (0,1). Consider the graph of $y=\cos x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(0^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The graph of $y=\cos x$ has a maximum point at $(0,1)$.
We want to find the first maximum point of the function $y=\cos(x+45^{\circ})$ for $x \geq 0$.
The graph of $y=\cos(x+45^{\circ})$ is a horizontal translation of the graph of $y=\cos x$ by $45^{\circ}$ to the left.
The maximum value of the function is still 1, since we are just shifting the cosine function.
The maximum value occurs when $x+45^{\circ} = 0^{\circ}$, which means $x=-45^{\circ}$.
However, we are looking for the first maximum point for $x \geq 0$.
Since the cosine function repeats every $360^{\circ}$, the maximum value will also occur when $x+45^{\circ} = 360^{\circ}$, so $x=360^{\circ}-45^{\circ}=315^{\circ}$.
However, we are looking for the first maximum point for $x \geq 0$. Since the graph is shifted $45^{\circ}$ to the left, we need to find a value $x \ge 0$ such that $x+45^{\circ} = 0^{\circ} + 360^{\circ}n$, where $n$ is an integer.
If $n=0$, then $x+45^{\circ}=0$, which means $x=-45^{\circ}$. But we want $x \geq 0$, so we need to choose a different value of $n$.
If $n=1$, then $x+45^{\circ}=360^{\circ}$, so $x=315^{\circ}$. Then $y = \cos(315^{\circ}+45^{\circ}) = \cos(360^{\circ}) = 1$.
Thus, the point $(315^{\circ}, 1)$ is a maximum point for $y=\cos(x+45^{\circ})$.
Alternatively, let's consider where the first maximum occurs for $x \ge 0$. The cosine function is shifted $45^{\circ}$ to the left.
The first maximum occurs when $x+45^{\circ}=0$, which gives $x=-45^{\circ}$. Since we want $x \geq 0$, we must look for the first $x$ such that $\cos(x+45^{\circ})=1$ and $x \geq 0$.
Since the period of cosine is $360^{\circ}$, we have $\cos(x+45^{\circ}) = \cos(x+45^{\circ}-360^{\circ})=\cos(x-315^{\circ})$.
So we want to find the first $x$ such that $x-315^{\circ}=0$, which gives $x=315^{\circ}$. Then $\cos(315^{\circ}+45^{\circ})=\cos(360^{\circ})=1$. So $(315^{\circ},1)$ is a maximum point.
When $x=0$, we have $y=\cos(45^{\circ}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707$.
However, we want to find the first time $y=1$, so we set $\cos(x+45^{\circ})=1$. This means $x+45^{\circ} = 0^{\circ}+360^{\circ}n$ for some integer $n$. If $n=0$, then $x+45^{\circ}=0$, so $x=-45^{\circ}$. But $x \geq 0$.
So we set $n=1$, giving $x+45^{\circ} = 360^{\circ}$, so $x=315^{\circ}$. This means $y=\cos(315^{\circ}+45^{\circ}) = \cos(360^{\circ}) = 1$. Thus, $(315^{\circ}, 1)$ is the first maximum point for $x \geq 0$.
