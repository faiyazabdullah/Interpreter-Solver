The quadratic function g(x) passes through the origin (0,0) and the point (2,-4).
Since g(x) passes through the origin, it can be written in the form g(x) = ax^2 + bx.
Since the curve goes through (0,0), g(0) = a(0)^2 + b(0) = 0, which is consistent.
Since the curve goes through (2,-4), g(2) = a(2)^2 + b(2) = 4a + 2b = -4.
Dividing by 2, we have 2a + b = -2, so b = -2 - 2a.
Thus, g(x) = ax^2 + (-2 - 2a)x = ax^2 - (2 + 2a)x.

From the graph, we can estimate the vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is x = 1.
If we rewrite g(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex, then the x-coordinate of the vertex is h.
The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by h = -b/(2a) = -(-2 - 2a)/(2a) = (2 + 2a)/(2a) = (1 + a)/a = 1/a + 1.
From the graph, we see that the vertex has an x-coordinate of 1, so 1/a + 1 = 1, meaning 1/a = 0, which implies a is infinite.
However, we are given that the vertex is (2, -4) is a point of the equation. This is not the vertex.
The vertex is at x=1. Thus (1+a)/a = 1.
The value of the function at x=1 is g(1) = a(1)^2 - (2 + 2a)(1) = a - 2 - 2a = -a - 2.
From the graph, the value of the function at x=1 is y = -2. So -a - 2 = -2, which implies a = 0.
Since a cannot be 0, this form doesn't seem correct.

Let's assume the vertex is at (1, -2). Then g(x) = a(x - 1)^2 - 2.
Since the curve goes through (0,0), g(0) = a(0 - 1)^2 - 2 = a - 2 = 0, so a = 2.
Thus g(x) = 2(x - 1)^2 - 2 = 2(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 2 = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 - 2 = 2x^2 - 4x.
Let's check the point (2, -4): g(2) = 2(2)^2 - 4(2) = 8 - 8 = 0, which is not equal to -4.
The x intercept is x=0. 2x^2-4x=0. 2x(x-2)=0. Thus x=0 and x=2.
Assume the function is g(x)= a(x)(x-2). Since (1,-2) is on the curve. g(1)= a(1)(-1)=-a. -a = -2. a=2.
So the function is g(x) = 2x(x-2) = 2x^2 - 4x.

Alternative Method:
g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.
Since it passes through (0,0), c=0. So g(x)= ax^2+bx.
Since it passes through (2,-4), -4=4a+2b. -2 = 2a+b. b=-2-2a.
Therefore, g(x) = ax^2+(-2-2a)x.
From observation, the graph looks like g(x) = k(x-0)(x-2).
Then k(x^2-2x)
The function goes through (1,-2). g(1)=-2=k(-1). k=2. g(x)=2(x^2-2x)= 2x^2 - 4x.
