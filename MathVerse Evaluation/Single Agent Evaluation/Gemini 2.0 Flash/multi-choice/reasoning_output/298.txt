QUESTION:
The diameters of \odot J and \odot K are on the same line with points A, B, C, and D. Circle J has a radius of 10 units, \odot K has a radius of 8 units, and B C = 5.4 units. Find J K.

CHOICES:
A:12.6
B:14.6
C:20.6
D:30.6

From the problem, we are given that the radius of \odot J is 10, so the diameter AJ = 2 * 10 = 20.
We are given that the radius of \odot K is 8, so the diameter KD = 2 * 8 = 16.
We are given that BC = 5.4.
We want to find JK.
Since J is the midpoint of AB, AJ = JB = 10.
Since K is the midpoint of CD, CK = KD = 8.
We have JK = JB + BC + CK = 10 + 5.4 + 8 = 23.4.
However, none of the answer choices match this result. It must be J K, not JB + BC + CK = JK.
AB = 2 * radius of \odot J = 2 * 10 = 20
CD = 2 * radius of \odot K = 2 * 8 = 16
BC = 5.4
We are looking for JK.
Let's say A, B, C, D are on the number line. Let A be at 0.
Then B = 20, C = 20 + 5.4 = 25.4, and D = 25.4 + 16 = 41.4.
J is the midpoint of AB, so J = A + 10 = 10
K is the midpoint of CD, so K = C + 8 = 25.4 + 8 = 33.4
Then JK = K - J = 33.4 - 10 = 23.4. Still no match in answer choices.

However, the problem states that the diameters are on the same line. The question is asking the distance JK.
The radius of circle J is 10.
The radius of circle K is 8.
BC = 5.4
JK = radius of J + BC + radius of K = 10 + 5.4 + 8 = 23.4
None of the answers are near.

AB = 20
BC = 5.4
CD = 16
AJ = radius of J = 10
CK = radius of K = 8

Let's denote the coordinate of A as 0.
The coordinate of B is AB = 20
The coordinate of C is AB + BC = 20 + 5.4 = 25.4
The coordinate of D is AB + BC + CD = 20 + 5.4 + 16 = 41.4
J is the midpoint of AB, so the coordinate of J is 20/2 = 10
K is the midpoint of CD, so the coordinate of K is (25.4 + 41.4)/2 = 66.8/2 = 33.4
Then JK = |33.4 - 10| = 23.4

Since the two circles overlap,
JK = r1 + r2 - BC = 10 + 8 - 5.4 = 12.6
