The problem states that the graph of a trigonometric function has a maximum point at $(1.2, 5.5)$ and an amplitude of $3.5$. We need to find the midline equation of the function.
The midline is the horizontal line that runs midway between the maximum and minimum values of the function.
The amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum (or minimum) value.

Let $y_{max}$ be the maximum value of the function, $y_{min}$ be the minimum value of the function, and $y_{mid}$ be the value of the midline.
We are given that the maximum value is $y_{max} = 5.5$ and the amplitude is $3.5$.

Since the amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum value, we can write:
Amplitude $= y_{max} - y_{mid}$
$3.5 = 5.5 - y_{mid}$
$y_{mid} = 5.5 - 3.5$
$y_{mid} = 2$

The midline equation is $y = y_{mid}$, so the midline equation is $y = 2$.
