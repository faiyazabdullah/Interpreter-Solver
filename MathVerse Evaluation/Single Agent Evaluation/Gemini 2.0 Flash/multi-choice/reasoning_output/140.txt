QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in a badminton game, Lin Dan, the athlete standing at M in the field, clicks the request from N to point B in the opponent. It is known that the net height OA = 1.52, OB = 4.0, OM = 5.0, then when Lin Dan takes off, the distance from the hitting point to the ground NM = ()

CHOICES:
A:3.42m
B:1.9m
C:3m
D:3.24m

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the problem, we know that AO is perpendicular to MB and NM is perpendicular to MB, so AO is parallel to NM.
Therefore, triangle ABO is similar to triangle NBM.
So, AO/NM = BO/BM, which means 1.52/NM = 4/(4+5) = 4/9
NM = (1.52 * 9)/4 = 3.42
Therefore, the answer is A.

Final Answer: A
