GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The angle $b$ is formed in a right-angled triangle. The side adjacent to angle $b$ is 42 km and the side opposite to the other angle is 57 km.
We can use the tangent function to find the angle whose tangent is $\frac{57}{42}$.
Then $tan(b) = \frac{57}{42}$.
Therefore $b = arctan(\frac{57}{42})$
$b = arctan(1.357142857)$
$b \approx 53.6^{\circ}$
The angle marked b is approximately 53.6 degrees.
