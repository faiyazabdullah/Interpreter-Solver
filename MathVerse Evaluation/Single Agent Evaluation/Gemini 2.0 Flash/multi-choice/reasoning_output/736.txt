GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a pyramid. The base is a rectangle with length 9 cm and width 3 cm. The height of the pyramid is given as 14 cm.

The volume of a pyramid is given by the formula V = (1/3) * base area * height.
In this case, the base area is length * width = 9 cm * 3 cm = 27 cm^2.
The height of the pyramid is 14 cm.
Therefore, the volume of the pyramid is V = (1/3) * 27 cm^2 * 14 cm = 9 cm^2 * 14 cm = 126 cm^3.
