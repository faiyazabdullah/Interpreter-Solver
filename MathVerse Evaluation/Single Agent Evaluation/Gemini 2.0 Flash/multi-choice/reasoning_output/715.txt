The figure is a cylinder with three-quarters of its volume remaining.
The height of the cylinder is given as 12 cm, and the radius is 5 cm.
We need to calculate the surface area.

The surface area consists of:
1. The curved surface area: (3/4) * (2 * pi * r * h) = (3/4) * (2 * pi * 5 * 12) = (3/4) * (120 * pi) = 90 * pi
2. The area of three-quarters of a circle at each end: 2 * (3/4 * pi * r^2) = 2 * (3/4 * pi * 5^2) = 2 * (3/4 * 25 * pi) = (3/2) * 25 * pi = 37.5 * pi
3. Two rectangular faces: 2 * (r * h) = 2 * (5 * 12) = 2 * 60 = 120

Total Surface Area = 90 * pi + 37.5 * pi + 120 = 127.5 * pi + 120
Using pi = 3.14159, 127.5 * 3.14159 = 400.559
Total Surface Area = 400.559 + 120 = 520.559

Therefore, the surface area is approximately 520.56 square centimeters.
