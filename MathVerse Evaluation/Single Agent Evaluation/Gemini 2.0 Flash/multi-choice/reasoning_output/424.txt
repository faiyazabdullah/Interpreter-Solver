QUESTION:
As shown in the figure above, a triangle has an angle of 50° and two sides of 12m and 13.1m. Calculate the area of the following triangle.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
Area = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C)
where a and b are the lengths of two sides and C is the angle between them.

In this case, a = 12 m, b = 13.1 m, and C = 50°.

Area = (1/2) * 12 * 13.1 * sin(50°)
Area = 6 * 13.1 * sin(50°)
Area ≈ 6 * 13.1 * 0.766
Area ≈ 78.6 * 0.766
Area ≈ 60.2196

Rounding to two decimal places, the area is approximately 60.22 square meters.
Since there are no answer choices, I cannot compare my answer.
