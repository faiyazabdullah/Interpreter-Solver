GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The domain is the set of all possible x-values for the function. The graph starts at x = -3 (not included because of the open circle) and ends at x = 1 (included because of the closed circle). Therefore, the domain is (-3, 1].

The range is the set of all possible y-values for the function. The lowest point of the graph is at y = -4, and the highest point is at y = 0. The function takes on all y-values between -4 and 0, inclusive. Therefore, the range is [-4, 0].
