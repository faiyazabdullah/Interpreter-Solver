Let's find the surface area of the prism.

The prism consists of 10 rectangles. We will calculate the area of each face and sum them up.
The bottom face: 17cm * 3cm = 51 sq cm
The front face: 16cm * 3cm = 48 sq cm
The back face: 16cm * 3cm = 48 sq cm
The top face can be split into two rectangles:
- Large rectangle: 13cm * 3cm = 39 sq cm
- Small rectangle: 4cm * 3cm = 12 sq cm
Total top face = 39 + 12 = 51 sq cm
The left face: 8cm * 3cm = 24 sq cm
The right face (which is L shaped): 17*8 - 4 * 8 = 136 -32 = 104

Calculating the faces that are visible in the given image:
Front = 16*3=48
Right side = 17*8 - 4*8 = 13*8=104
Top = (17-4)*3 + 4*3 = 13*3+12 = 39+12 = 51
Then add the faces that are hidden behind.
Back = 16*3 = 48
Left side = 3*8 = 24
Bottom = 17*3 = 51

Two rectangular surfaces on the top: 4x3=12 and 13*3 = 39
Two rectangular surfaces on the sides: 8*3=24 and 16*3=48
Two rectangular surfaces in the front and back: 17*3=51 and (17-4)*3 = 39
and the one additional top rectangular surface 4*3 = 12
The front and back surfaces have dimensions 16*3=48 each

Add up the areas:
Top: (17-4)*3 + 4*3 = 13*3 + 4*3 = 39+12 = 51
Bottom: 17*3 = 51
Left: 8*3 = 24
Right: (8+8)*3 =16*3=48 + 8*3=24
Front: 16*3 = 48
Back: 16*3 = 48

But there is a hidden area between the blocks that is an area of 4cm by 8cm which appears twice: 2*4*8=64

So the sum should be:
51 + 51 + 24 + 48 + 48 + 48 +64
=51+51+24+48+48+64
102+24+48+48+64
126+48+48+64
174+48+64
222+64=286

Surface area: 2*(16*3) + 2*(17*3) + 2*(8*3) + (4*3) + (13*3) + 2*(4*8)
= 2*(48) + 2*(51) + 2*(24) + 12 + 39 + 64
= 96 + 102 + 48 + 12 + 39 + 64 = 361
The surface area is equal to 361 square cm
