QUESTION:
Simon has a certain length of fencing to enclose a rectangular area. The quadratic function A with a vertec of (10, 100) models the rectangle's area (in square meters) as a function of its width (in meters). It intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). Which of these statements are true?

CHOICES:
A:Greater width always relates to smaller area.
B:Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than $10 \mathrm{~m}$.
C:When there is no width, the area is $20 \mathrm{~m}^2$.
D:When there is no width, the area is $0 \mathrm{~m}^2$.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem states that the quadratic function A models the area of a rectangle as a function of its width.

A: The graph shows that area increases as width increases until the width reaches 10 m. After that point, area decreases as width increases. Therefore, a greater width does not always relate to a smaller area. This statement is false.

B: The graph shows that as the width increases from 0 m to 10 m, the area also increases.  Therefore, greater width relates to a greater area as long as the width is less than 10 m. As the width goes above 10m, the area decreases as the width increases. Therefore, this statement is false.

C: The graph shows that when there is no width (width = 0 m), the area is 0 square meters, not 20 square meters. This statement is false.

D: The graph intersects the y-axis at (0, 0), which represents that when the width is 0, the area is 0. Therefore, when there is no width, the area is 0 square meters. This statement is true.
