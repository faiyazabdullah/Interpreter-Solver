In triangle ABC, angle C = 30 degrees. According to the inscribed angle theorem, the central angle corresponding to the arc AB is twice the inscribed angle C, so angle AOB = 2 * angle C = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees. Since OA = OB = 5, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle with a 60-degree angle, making it an equilateral triangle. Therefore, AB = OA = OB = 5.

In triangle ABP, we have PB = AB, so PB = 5. Since P is a point on the circle, we need to consider two cases:
1. Point P and C are on the same side of line AB:
Since PB = AB, triangle ABP is an isosceles triangle. Since arc AB corresponds to a 60-degree central angle, the measure of inscribed angle APB equals 30 degrees. Angle PAB = angle PBA = (180 - 30)/2 = 75 degrees. Using the law of cosines in triangle ABP:
PA^2 = AB^2 + PB^2 - 2*AB*PB*cos(angle PBA)
PA^2 = 5^2 + 5^2 - 2*5*5*cos(75)
PA^2 = 50 - 50*cos(75) = 50(1 - cos(75)) = 50(1 - (√6-√2)/4)
PA is not 5, 5√3/2, 5√2, or 5√3. This case may be wrong.

2. If PB = AB = 5, since AB is the chord, then angle APB is inscribed angle = 30 degree or (180-30=150degree) degree
Because AB=PB=5, so triangle ABP is an isosceles triangle. We have <PAB= <BPA = 1/2(180-PBA). So PAB will be 75 degree.
If the angle APB is 30 then <PAB=<PBA= 1/2 (180-30)=75. And PA is not easy to compute.
If the angle APB is 150, not possible.
If PB=AB=5, angle APB = 60 degree. AB=PB = PA = 5
Then angle APB = 180-2<PAB, <PBA = 60; then PBA will be.

3. Since it is given that PB = AB = 5. Then OA=OB = AB=5. Triangle OAB is equilateral triangle and <AOB =60, so arc AB=60. arc ACB = 360-60=300. <APB=1/2 =150. Since <PAB = <PBA= <30, <ABP is isosceles triangle.

If triangle ABP is isosceles triangle with PB=AB, then PB= AB =5 = radius, so anglePAB will be related. since the length of PA needs to determine the answer.
If point A and point C is located on one side, or two opposite side. We know <ACB =30, that means<AOB =60 since it is centerangle, OA = OB.
<APB =30 if A and B are on same point. But PB=AB.

If PB = AB, and AB = 5, so PB = AB = 5. Since radius is 5, OA = OB = 5. so the side AB of triangle ABC is 5. So PA maybe also be equal to 5 or not equal to 5. AB =5, angle c =30.
If AB = BC =CA = 5.

I think the answer should be A:5
