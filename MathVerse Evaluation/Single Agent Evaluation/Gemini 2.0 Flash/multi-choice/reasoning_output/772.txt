QUESTION:
In the figure above,line k and line l intersect perpendicularly, and line k and line m intersect at an angle of xÂ°. Lines l and m are not parallel. Which of the following cannot be the value of x?

CHOICES:
A.89
B.90
C.91
D.92
E.93

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
If line l and line m are not parallel, then line k cannot be perpendicular to both lines.
Since line k is perpendicular to line l, the angle between k and l is 90 degrees.
If line k were also perpendicular to line m, then the angle x would be 90 degrees, which would mean that lines l and m are parallel.
However, the problem states that lines l and m are NOT parallel.
Thus, x cannot be 90 degrees.
