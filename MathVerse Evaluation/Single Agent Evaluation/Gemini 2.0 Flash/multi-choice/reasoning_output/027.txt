QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, when planting trees on flat ground, the plant spacing (the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees) is required to be 4.0. If trees are planted on a hillside with a slope of 0.75, and the plant spacing is also required to be 4.0, then the slope distance between two adjacent trees is ()

CHOICES:
A:5m
B:6m
C:7m
D:8m

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the slope be $m = 0.75 = \frac{3}{4}$.
Let the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees be $x = 4.0$.
Let the vertical distance between two adjacent trees be $y$.
Then the slope is given by $m = \frac{y}{x}$, so $y = mx = 0.75 \times 4.0 = \frac{3}{4} \times 4 = 3$.
The slope distance between two adjacent trees is $d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
Substituting the values, $d = \sqrt{4.0^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5$.
Therefore, the slope distance between two adjacent trees is 5.
