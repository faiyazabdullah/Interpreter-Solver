The radius of the circle is $6 \mathrm{~cm}$.

The area of a circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.

In this case, the radius is $r = 6 \mathrm{~cm}$.
So, the area of the circle is $A = \pi (6 \mathrm{~cm})^2 = \pi (36 \mathrm{~cm}^2) = 36\pi \mathrm{~cm}^2$.
Using the value of $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we have $A \approx 36 \times 3.14159 \mathrm{~cm}^2 \approx 113.09724 \mathrm{~cm}^2$.

Rounding to one decimal place, we get $A \approx 113.1 \mathrm{~cm}^2$.

Since the answer choices are not given, I will just provide the answer I calculated. However, if there were answer choices, I would select the one closest to $113.1 \mathrm{~cm}^2$.

Final Answer: A
