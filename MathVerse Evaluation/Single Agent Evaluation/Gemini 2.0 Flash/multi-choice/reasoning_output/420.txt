The figure is a parallelogram, which means that opposite sides have the same length. The given side length is 10 cm. The length of the height of the parallelogram is given as 6 cm. We need to find the length of the missing side. Let's say we want to find the perimeter.

In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. So, if one side is 10 cm, the opposite side is also 10 cm. The other side is not directly given, but the perpendicular height is given as 6cm.
However, we are asked to find the length of the missing side. This means we need to find the length of the side to which the height of 6 cm is perpendicular.
Since the opposite sides of the parallelogram are equal, the length of the missing side is equal to the length of the side opposite to it. We are not given this value. So we cannot find the exact perimeter.
But since we are asked to find the length of the missing side of a trapezium, and the trapezium here is a parallelogram, and one side is 10 cm, we need to know the other side to find the perimeter.

However, if the question asked to find the value of one side if the height is 6 cm, the parallelogram could have many possible values. There is no formula to uniquely determine the side length given just the height.

It seems like the problem asks to find the length of the missing side.  In the parallelogram, one side is 10cm and the height is 6cm. The opposite side is equal in length. Without the length of the other side, it is not possible to find the perimeter. It can be assumed that the other length can be 6 cm if it is a rectangle, but there is no indication that is a rectangle.

Based on the diagram, it looks like two adjacent sides have lengths 10 cm and 6 cm. Then, the perimeter of the trapezium would be 2*(10+6) = 2*16 = 32.

However, we are asked to find the length of the missing side only.
Let's assume the base has length 10 cm, and the height is 6 cm. The "missing side" is the length of the other side. If this were a rectangle, the length would be 6 cm.
Since we are given 10 cm and 6 cm, it is possible that we are looking for the other side to be 6 cm. However, we cannot deduce the value of the other side.
