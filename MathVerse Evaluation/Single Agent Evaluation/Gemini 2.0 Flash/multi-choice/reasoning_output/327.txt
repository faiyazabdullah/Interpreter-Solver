QUESTION:
During a rescue search, a helicopter flew b kilometres west from point X to point Y, then changed course and flew 10.7 kilometres north to point Z. If point Z is on a bearing of 335° T from point X:

Now, if the distance that the helicopter must fly between point Z and point X is d kilometres, calculate d to one decimal place.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

The bearing of Z from X is 335°. This means the angle between the north direction and the line XZ is 360° - 335° = 25° west of north.
Since the helicopter flew west from X to Y, then north from Y to Z, the triangle XYZ is a right-angled triangle, with the right angle at Y.
Let the angle ZXY be θ. Then θ = 90° - 25° = 65°.

In triangle XYZ, we have YZ = 10.7 km.
We need to find the distance d = XZ.
We have sin(θ) = YZ/XZ, so sin(25°) = XY/XZ, and cos(θ) = XY/XZ.
In triangle XYZ, tan(25°) = XY/10.7
We have XZ = d, XY = b, YZ = 10.7 km.
The angle between the North direction at X and XZ is 360° - 335° = 25°.
Let this angle be α, so α = 25°.
Then b = 10.7 * tan(25°).
Also we have, sin(25) = b/d, cos(25) = 10.7/d
d = 10.7/cos(25)
d = 10.7 / 0.9063
d = 11.805 km

Also XY / 10.7 = tan(25)
XY = 10.7 * tan(25) = 10.7 * 0.4663 = 4.989
By Pythagoras, XZ^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2
d^2 = (10.7*tan(25))^2 + (10.7)^2
d^2 = (4.989)^2 + (10.7)^2 = 24.89 + 114.49 = 139.38
d = sqrt(139.38) = 11.806 km.

Rounding to one decimal place, d = 11.8 km.
