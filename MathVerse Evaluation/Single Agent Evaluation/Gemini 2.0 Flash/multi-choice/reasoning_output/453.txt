QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the coordinates of the centre in the form $(a, b)$.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The circle intersects the x-axis at approximately -1 and 2. The center's x-coordinate is the average of these values, which is (-1+2)/2 = 1/2 = 0.5. The circle intersects the y-axis at approximately -2 and 2. The center's y-coordinate is the average of these values, which is (2 + (-2))/2 = 0. The coordinates of the center are (0.5, 0).

Final Answer: A
