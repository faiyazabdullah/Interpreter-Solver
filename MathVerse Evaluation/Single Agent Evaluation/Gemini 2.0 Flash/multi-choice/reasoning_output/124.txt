Let the radius of the circle be $r=1$. The circumference of the circle is $2\pi r = 2\pi(1) = 2\pi$. This circumference is the arc length of the sector. Let the radius of the sector be $R$. The central angle of the sector is $90^\circ$, which is $\frac{90}{360} = \frac{1}{4}$ of the full circle. The arc length of the sector is $\frac{1}{4}(2\pi R) = \frac{\pi R}{2}$. We are given that the arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the circle, so $\frac{\pi R}{2} = 2\pi$. Multiplying both sides by 2, we get $\pi R = 4\pi$. Dividing both sides by $\pi$, we have $R=4$.
The radius of the sector is 4.
