====================================================================================================
The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height.
In this case, the length is 8cm, the width is 2cm, and the height is 3cm.
Therefore, the volume V = 8cm * 2cm * 3cm = 48cmÂ³.
