The figure shows $\frac{3}{4}$ of a cylinder. The height is 15 cm and the radius is 5 cm.
The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.
In this case, $r = 5$ cm and $h = 15$ cm.
So, the volume of the full cylinder would be $V = \pi (5^2)(15) = \pi (25)(15) = 375\pi$ cubic centimeters.
Since the figure represents $\frac{3}{4}$ of a cylinder, we need to find $\frac{3}{4}$ of the volume of the full cylinder.
Volume of the figure = $\frac{3}{4} \times 375\pi = \frac{1125\pi}{4} \approx \frac{1125 \times 3.1415926535}{4} \approx \frac{3534.291735}{4} \approx 883.57293375$.
We are asked to correct the answer to two decimal places.
So the volume is approximately $883.57$ cubic centimeters.
