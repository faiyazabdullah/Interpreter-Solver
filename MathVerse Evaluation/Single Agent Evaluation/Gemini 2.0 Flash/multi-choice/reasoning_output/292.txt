QUESTION:
In the right triangle, an acute angle is 70 degrees and the hypotenuse is x length. Find x to the nearest hundredth.

CHOICES:
A:5.13
B:5.46
C:15.96
D:43.86

The problem provides a right triangle with one acute angle measuring 70 degrees and the length of the side opposite to this angle is 15. We are asked to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is labeled as 'x'.

We can use the sine function to relate the angle, the opposite side, and the hypotenuse:

sin(angle) = opposite / hypotenuse

In this case:

sin(70°) = 15 / x

To solve for x, we can rearrange the equation:

x = 15 / sin(70°)

Using a calculator to find the sine of 70 degrees, we get:

sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397

Now we can calculate x:

x = 15 / 0.9397
x ≈ 15.96

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse x is approximately 15.96.

Comparing this result with the given answer choices:
A: 5.13
B: 5.46
C: 15.96
D: 43.86

The closest answer is C: 15.96.

Final Answer: C
