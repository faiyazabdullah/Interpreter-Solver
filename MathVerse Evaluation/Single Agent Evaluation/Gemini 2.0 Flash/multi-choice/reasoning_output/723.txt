QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the cylindrical water tank is 3x and the radius of its base is 5x+3. The cylindrical water tank is leaking at a constant rate of 3\pi x litres per second (where x is a fixed unknown). If the water tank was initially full, calculate the amount of water remaining after \left(2x+2\right)^2 seconds. Give your simplified answer in expanded form.

No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The height of the cylinder is 3x, and the radius is 5x+3. The volume of the cylinder is given by $V = \pi r^2 h = \pi (5x+3)^2 (3x) = 3\pi x (25x^2 + 30x + 9) = \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x)$.

The tank is leaking at a rate of $3\pi x$ litres per second. After $(2x+2)^2$ seconds, the amount of water leaked is $3\pi x (2x+2)^2 = 3\pi x (4x^2 + 8x + 4) = \pi (12x^3 + 24x^2 + 12x)$.

The remaining water is the initial volume minus the amount leaked.
Remaining volume $= \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x) - \pi (12x^3 + 24x^2 + 12x) = \pi (75x^3 - 12x^3 + 90x^2 - 24x^2 + 27x - 12x) = \pi (63x^3 + 66x^2 + 15x)$.
The amount of water remaining is $\pi (63x^3 + 66x^2 + 15x)$.

Since no choices are provided, it is not possible to determine which answer option this matches. However, we have expressed the simplified answer in expanded form.
