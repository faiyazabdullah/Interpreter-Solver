QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with double arrows intersects with y-axis at -4 and 4. Its asymptote in dashed orange is $y=(4/5)x$ and $y=-(4/5)x$. There is also a green rectangular tangent to the hyperbola. Find the equation of the hyperbola.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given hyperbola opens upwards and downwards, which means that the equation is of the form $\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1$.
Since the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, we have $a=4$, so $a^2=16$.
The asymptotes are $y = \pm \frac{a}{b}x$.
We are given that the asymptotes are $y = \pm \frac{4}{5}x$.
Therefore, $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{4}{5}$. Since $a=4$, we have $\frac{4}{b} = \frac{4}{5}$, which implies $b=5$, so $b^2=25$.
Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is $\frac{y^2}{16} - \frac{x^2}{25} = 1$.
