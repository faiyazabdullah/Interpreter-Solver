QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-2,0), (0,0), (2,0). Use the vertical line test to determine if this relation is a function.

CHOICES:
A.This is a function
B.This is not a function

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The vertical line test states that a relation is a function if and only if no vertical line intersects the graph of the relation at more than one point. In the given graph, there are vertical lines that intersect the curve at more than one point. For example, a vertical line at $x=1$ intersects the curve at two points. Therefore, this relation is not a function.

Final Answer: B
