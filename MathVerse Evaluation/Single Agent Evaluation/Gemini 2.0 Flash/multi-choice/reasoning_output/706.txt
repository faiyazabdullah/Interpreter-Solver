The figure is a triangular prism.
The base is an isosceles triangle with waist length of 10 cm and base length of 12 cm.
The height of the prism is 16 cm.
We need to find the total surface area of the triangular prism.

First, we need to find the height of the triangular base.
Since the base is an isosceles triangle, the height bisects the base.
So we have a right triangle with hypotenuse 10 cm and one leg 6 cm.
Let the height be x.
Then, $x^2 + 6^2 = 10^2$
$x^2 + 36 = 100$
$x^2 = 64$
$x = 8$
The height of the triangular base is 8 cm.

The area of the triangular base is $\frac{1}{2} \times base \times height = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 8 = 48$ cm$^2$.
Since there are two triangular bases, the total area of the two bases is $2 \times 48 = 96$ cm$^2$.

The prism has three rectangular faces.
Two of them have dimensions 10 cm by 16 cm. The area is $2 \times (10 \times 16) = 2 \times 160 = 320$ cm$^2$.
The other rectangular face has dimensions 12 cm by 16 cm. The area is $12 \times 16 = 192$ cm$^2$.
The total area of the three rectangular faces is $320 + 192 = 512$ cm$^2$.

The total surface area of the triangular prism is $96 + 512 = 608$ cm$^2$.
