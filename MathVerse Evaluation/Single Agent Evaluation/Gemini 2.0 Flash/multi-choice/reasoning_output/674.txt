The cylinder has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 2.5 cm. It contains two identical spherical balls that fit exactly inside.
This means the diameter of each sphere is equal to the radius of the cylinder, which is 2.5 cm, so the diameter is 2(2.5) = 5 cm.
Therefore, the radius of each sphere is 2.5 cm.
The height of the cylinder is 10 cm and it contains two spheres, so each sphere has a height of 10/2 = 5 cm.
Thus, the diameter of each sphere is 5 cm and the radius is 2.5 cm.
The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula 4 * pi * r^2, where r is the radius.
So, the surface area of each ball is 4 * pi * (2.5)^2 = 4 * pi * 6.25 = 25 * pi.
Since pi is approximately 3.14159, the surface area is approximately 25 * 3.14159 = 78.53975.
To one decimal place, the surface area of each ball is 78.5 cm^2.

Since there are no answer choices, I can't compare my answer.
