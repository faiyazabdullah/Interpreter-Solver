QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

CHOICES:
No choices found.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The function f(x) = x^2 is the blue parabola. The vertex is at (0,0).
The function g(x) is a translated version of f(x).
The vertex of g(x) is at (-3, -5).
Therefore, g(x) = (x+3)^2 - 5
g(x) = (x - (-3))^2 + (-5)

Thus, g(x) is f(x) translated 3 units to the left and 5 units down.

Since there are no answer choices, I cannot select one.
However, the equation for g(x) is (x+3)^2 - 5.

Final Answer: A
