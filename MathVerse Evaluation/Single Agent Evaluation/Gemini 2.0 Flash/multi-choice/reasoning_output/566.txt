QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening upward with a vertex of (3,âˆ’8) and a minimum value of -8. f(x)=x^2-2x+1. Which function has a greater y-intercept, f(x) or g(x)?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ has a greater $y$-intercept than $g$.
B:$g$ has a greater $y$-intercept than $f$.
C:$f$ and $g$ share the same $y$-intercept.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The $y$-intercept is the value of the function when $x=0$.

For $f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1$, the $y$-intercept is $f(0) = 0^2 - 2(0) + 1 = 1$.
For $g(x)$, the graph is a parabola with vertex $(3, -8)$.
The general form of a parabola is $g(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.
So, $g(x) = a(x-3)^2 - 8$.
From the graph, we can see that $g(0) = a(0-3)^2 - 8 = 9a - 8$.
The $y$-intercept of $g(x)$ is the value when $x=0$, which visually is above $y=6$. From the graph, we know it opens upward, and we are given the vertex is at (3,-8). Since g(x) must pass (6,0), plugging that into g(x):
0 = a(6-3)^2 - 8
0 = 9a - 8
8 = 9a
a=8/9
Then, we can write the full quadratic g(x) = (8/9)(x-3)^2 - 8.
g(0) = (8/9)(0-3)^2 - 8 = (8/9)(9) - 8 = 8-8 = 0.
Another point we see is approximately (1,-3)
-3= a(1-3)^2 - 8
-3 = 4a-8
5=4a
a=5/4
Using the formula: $g(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k$, where $(h, k)$ is the vertex.
So, $g(x) = a(x-3)^2 - 8$.
Visually, g(0) looks to be close to -0.5, let's estimate one point to be (5,0)
0 = a(5-3)^2 - 8
8=4a
a=2
so g(x) = 2(x-3)^2 -8
g(0) = 2(0-3)^2 - 8 = 2(9) - 8 = 18 - 8 = 10
From the graph, we know that $g(0)$ is positive and above y=6, but g(6) is 0, so g(x) goes below zero when x is between 0 and 6. Let's use this information.
$g(x) = a(x-3)^2 - 8$. We need to find one point on the graph, based on the given graph, we could approximate a point at $(1,-3)$
-3 = a(1-3)^2 - 8
-3 = a(-2)^2 - 8
5 = 4a
a=5/4
Then $g(x) = (5/4)(x-3)^2 - 8$
$g(0) = (5/4)(0-3)^2 - 8 = (5/4)(9) - 8 = 45/4 - 32/4 = 13/4 = 3.25$.
$f(0) = 1$. Since $3.25>1$, the $y$-intercept of $g(x)$ is greater.
