QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\cos a$.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The angle $a$ is in standard position, with the terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$.
Since the center of the circle is at the origin and the radius is 1, we have a unit circle.
For a point $(x, y)$ on the unit circle, we have $x = \cos a$ and $y = \sin a$.
Since $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$ is the point on the unit circle, we have $\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}$ and $\sin a = \frac{20}{29}$.

Therefore, $\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}$.
