The image shows a rectangular prism. The height of the prism is 10 cm. The base is a square with side length 13 cm. The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the formula V = lwh, where l is the length, w is the width, and h is the height. In this case, l = 13 cm, w = 13 cm, and h = 10 cm. Therefore, the volume of the rectangular prism is V = 13 cm * 13 cm * 10 cm = 169 cm^2 * 10 cm = 1690 cm^3. Since there are no answer choices, I cannot compare my answer to a choice. The volume of the rectangular prism is 1690 cubic centimeters.
