The problem asks us to find the value of cos X, where X is an angle in a right triangle. We are given the lengths of all three sides of the triangle: VX = 75, VW = 72, and XW = 21.
By definition, in a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In triangle VXW, with respect to angle X, the adjacent side is XW and the hypotenuse is VX.
Therefore, cos X = XW / VX = 21 / 75.
To express this as a decimal, we divide 21 by 75:
21 / 75 = 0.28
The ratio of cos X as a decimal is 0.28.

Final Answer: A
