The image shows a point $A$ on the unit circle. A right triangle is formed with the origin, the x-axis, and the perpendicular from point $A$ to the x-axis. The angle between the x-axis and the line connecting the origin to point $A$ is given as $\frac{\pi}{4}$.
We need to find the coordinates of point $A$.
Let the coordinates of point $A$ be $(x, y)$.
Since the radius of the circle is 1, we have $x = \cos(\frac{\pi}{4})$ and $y = \sin(\frac{\pi}{4})$.
We know that $\cos(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$ and $\sin(\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$.
Therefore, the coordinates of point $A$ are $(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})$.
In decimal form, $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx \frac{1.414}{2} \approx 0.707$. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, this is 0.71.
So, the coordinates of point $A$ are approximately $(0.71, 0.71)$.
