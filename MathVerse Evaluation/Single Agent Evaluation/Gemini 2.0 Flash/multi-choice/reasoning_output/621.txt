QUESTION:
Consider the graph shown. A curve passes (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), (3,8). As x increases, y increases.


Which of the following relationships could be represented by the given graph?

CHOICES:
A:The number of handshakes, y, made by x people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.
B:The number of layers, y, resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half x times.
C:The number of people, y, attending a parent/teacher conference when there are x parents who each bring 2 children.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The graph shows an exponential relationship. Let's analyze each answer choice.

A: The number of handshakes, y, made by x people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.
The number of handshakes is given by the formula y = x(x-1)/2.
For x=0, y = 0(0-1)/2 = 0.
For x=1, y = 1(1-1)/2 = 0.
For x=2, y = 2(2-1)/2 = 1.
For x=3, y = 3(3-1)/2 = 3.
For x=4, y = 4(4-1)/2 = 6.
This does not fit the graph.

B: The number of layers, y, resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half x times.
If x = 0, y = 1 (original number of layers)
If x = 1, y = 2
If x = 2, y = 4
If x = 3, y = 8
This fits the graph.

C: The number of people, y, attending a parent/teacher conference when there are x parents who each bring 2 children.
If x = 0, y = 0 (0 parents bring 2 children each)
If x = 1, y = 3 (1 parent plus 2 children)
If x = 2, y = 6 (2 parents plus 4 children)
If x = 3, y = 9 (3 parents plus 6 children)
The relationship is y = 2x + x = 3x, which is linear.

The given graph appears to be an exponential function of the form y = 2^x. The points on the graph are (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 8).
Option B matches this pattern:
x = 0, y = 2^0 = 1
x = 1, y = 2^1 = 2
x = 2, y = 2^2 = 4
x = 3, y = 2^3 = 8

Final Answer: B
