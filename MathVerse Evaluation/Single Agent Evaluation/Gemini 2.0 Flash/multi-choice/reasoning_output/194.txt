In the right triangle ABC, angle CAB = 60 degrees, and AD = 6. Let's assume that the round nut touches the desktop at point D and the triangle ruler at point E. Let O be the center of the round nut. Then OD is perpendicular to AC, and OE is perpendicular to AB. Also, OD = OE = r, where r is the radius of the round nut.
Since angle CAB = 60 degrees, angle OAD = 90 degrees, and OA is the angle bisector of angle DAE, angle DAO = 90 degrees. Therefore, angle OAD = 90 degrees.
Also, in triangle ODA, OD = r and AD = 6. Since angle DAO = 30 degrees, we have tan(30) = OD / AD = r / 6.
Since tan(30) = 1 / sqrt(3) = sqrt(3) / 3, we have r / 6 = sqrt(3) / 3, which means r = 6 * sqrt(3) / 3 = 2 * sqrt(3).
The outer diameter of the round nut is 2r = 2 * (2 * sqrt(3)) = 4 * sqrt(3). However, the angle CAB is 60 degrees, which means the angle between the ruler and the desktop is 60 degrees. Also AD = 6.

In the right triangle, the angle at A is 60 degrees. Let r be the radius of the round nut. Since the nut is tangent to the line AD at D, OD is perpendicular to AD. Also, OD = r. We have AD = 6. Therefore, tan(60 degrees) = BC/AC. Also sin(60 degrees) = BC/AB and cos(60 degrees) = AC/AB.
Consider the right triangle formed by the center of the round nut and the line AD. Let the radius be r. Then tan(30) = r/AD, because the distance from the center to the ruler splits the 60 angle in half giving you 30 and 60 degree triangle, and AD is adjacent. Thus, r = AD * tan(30) = AD * (1/sqrt(3)) = AD * (sqrt(3) / 3). Then the diameter = 2r = 2AD * (sqrt(3) / 3).

Since AD = 6, we have 2r = 2 * 6 * (sqrt(3) / 3) = 12 * sqrt(3) / 3 = 4 * sqrt(3). However, since AD = 6, the angle is actually equal to 30, which implies r/6 = tan30. Therefore the value of r is equal to 6*tan30 = 6*sqrt3/3=2sqrt3. Thus the diameter will be 2r = 4sqrt3.
If AD = 6 and the angle at A is 60 degrees, we are looking for the diameter, which would be approximately 12. We are dealing with triangle so we can say: Sin (60) = opposite/hypotenuse. If the other angle at A is 30 degrees, and the opposite/adjacent = Tan(30) degree, and AD is adjacent = 6. Then radius is equal to tan (30)* AD.
With the provided information, if we extend the line and treat it as a right triangle, we should use sin (60) = height/AD. Then height is Sin (60) * 6. It does not seem correct to use it.
With right triangle ABC, and right angle C, and an angle of 60 degree at A. and AD = 6. then, if we draw the height from point O to AC, with the perpendicular distance to r, therefore, tan(30) = r / 6 = r/6. Therefore, r is equal to 2 * sqrt (3), and diameter will be 4 * sqrt (3). In a right triangle: sin = opposite/hypotenuse, cosine = adjancet/hypotenuous. Since AD =6 and angle Cab is equal to 60. then we assume this is 30.
