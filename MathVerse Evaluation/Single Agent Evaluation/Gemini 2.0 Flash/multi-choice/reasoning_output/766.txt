QUESTION:
In the figure above, point B lies on side AC. This figure consists of triangles BCD and BAD. If 55 < x < 60, what is one possible value of y ?

In triangle ABD, the sum of angles is 180 degrees.
So, angle A + angle ABD + angle ADB = 180.
In triangle CBD, the sum of angles is 180 degrees.
So, y + angle CDB + angle DBC = 180.
Also, angle ABC is a straight line, so x + angle DBC = 180.
Therefore, angle DBC = 180 - x.
Substituting this in the equation for triangle CBD:
y + angle CDB + (180 - x) = 180
y + angle CDB - x = 0
y = x - angle CDB.
Since 55 < x < 60, let's take x = 56.
Then, y = 56 - angle CDB.
Since angle CDB is an angle of a triangle, it must be greater than 0. Also it is unlikely to be too large, given the figure. Suppose angle CDB = 10, then y = 56 - 10 = 46.

Consider the case where x = 59.
Then y = 59 - angle CDB. Suppose angle CDB = 10. Then y = 59 - 10 = 49.
Suppose angle CDB = 20, then y = 59 - 20 = 39.
Since we are looking for a possible value of y, we need to select a plausible value for angle CDB.
If the triangle BCD looks isosceles, we might expect y and angle CDB to be equal, then
2y = x or y = x/2, so y could be in the range 27.5 < y < 30.

We know that angle ADB + angle CDB = angle ADC. Also A + ABD + x + y + CDB = 360

Let's assume x is close to 60 and y is close to 30.
Then angle DBC is about 120.
Since we don't have more information, we can't solve this problem exactly. We are told 55 < x < 60.
