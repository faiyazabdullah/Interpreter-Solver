Since AB || EF, the alternate interior angles are equal.
Let the point where the line from A intersects EF be G.
Then angle BAE + angle AEG = 180 degrees.
Given angle BAC = 50 degrees. Let's extend AC to H. Then angle BAH = 180-50 = 130 degrees.
Since AB || EF, angle BAH + angle AHG = 180. Then angle AHG = 180-130 = 50 degrees.
Also, CD is perpendicular to EF, so angle CDG = 90 degrees.
Now, consider the quadrilateral formed by A, G, D, and C.
The sum of angles is 360. So angle CAG + angle AGD + angle GDC + angle DCA = 360.
Thus, 50 + 50 + 90 + angle ACD = 360. This is incorrect.

Let's extend AB and DC to meet at some point X.
AB || EF, CD perpendicular to EF, so CD is perpendicular to AB.
Therefore angle AXC = 90.
angle BAC = 50 degrees.
In triangle AXC, angle BAC + angle AXC + angle ACD = 180.
Thus, 50 + 90 + angle BCA = 180.
ACD + 90 + 50 = 180
Angle BAC + angle X = 90. So 50 + angle X = 90, which means angle X = 40.
Since angle ACB and angle ACD form a straight line, angle ACD = 180 - (180 - 50-90)= 180-40 = 140 degrees.
Let's draw a line parallel to AB and EF through C. Call the points on the parallel line I and J, so ICJ is the parallel line.
Let angle ACI = x, angle JCE = y.
Since AB || ICJ, angle BAC + angle ACI = 180. So, 50 + x = 180, implying x = 130. Wrong.
Since AB || ICJ, angle BAC + angle ACI = 180. So angle ACI = 180-50 = 130.
EF || ICJ. Since CD is perpendicular to EF, CD is perpendicular to ICJ. So angle DCJ = 90.
angle ACD = angle ACI + angle DCJ.
So angle ACD = 50 + 90 = 140. No.
angle ACD = 180 - angle ACC = 130 wrong
Then the other angle is 90, wrong!
angle ACI = 50 since AB|| to the line passing through C and making an angle with A. Since AB || EF, it is equal. Therefore angle formed by this point is 50 and add it to 90 to get 140.
