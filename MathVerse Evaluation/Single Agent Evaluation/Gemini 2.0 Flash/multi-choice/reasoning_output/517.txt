QUESTION:
Consider the graphs of the functions $y=4^{x}$ and $y=\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{x}$. How would you describe the rate of increase of $y=4^{x}$ ?

CHOICES:
A.$y$ is increasing at a constant rate
B.$y$ is increasing at a decreasing rate
C.$y$ is increasing at an increasing rate

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph of $y=4^x$ is shown. As $x$ increases, the value of $y$ increases. The graph becomes steeper as $x$ increases, indicating that the rate of increase of $y$ is increasing as $x$ increases.
Therefore, $y$ is increasing at an increasing rate.

Final Answer: C
