QUESTION:
For the following exercises, use the graph in Figure 7, which shows the profit, y, in thousands of dollars, of a company in a given year, t, where t represents the number of years since 1980. The line chart is begin from (15,150) and goes to (25,130).

Find the linear function  y,  where  y  depends on  t,  the number of years since 1980.

No choices found.

From the graph, we can identify two points on the line: (15, 150) and (25, 130). The profit y is in thousands of dollars, and t represents the number of years since 1980.
First, calculate the slope (m) of the line:
m = (y2 - y1) / (t2 - t1) = (130 - 150) / (25 - 15) = -20 / 10 = -2

Now we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation: y - y1 = m(t - t1)
Using point (15, 150): y - 150 = -2(t - 15)
y - 150 = -2t + 30
y = -2t + 180

The linear function is y = -2t + 180, where y is the profit in thousands of dollars, and t is the number of years since 1980.
