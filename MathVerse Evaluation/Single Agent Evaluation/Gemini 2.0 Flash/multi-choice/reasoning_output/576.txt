QUESTION:
A polynomial function p is graphed, which goes through (-5,0), (-1.5,0), (2,0). What could be the equation of p?

CHOICES:
A:p(x)=(x+5)(2 x+3)(x-2)
B:p(x)=(x-5)(2 x-3)(x+2)
C:p(x)=(-5 x)\left(-\frac{3}{2} x\right)(2 x)
D:p(x)=(5 x)\left(\frac{3}{2} x\right)(-2 x)

The polynomial function p goes through (-5,0), (-1.5,0), and (2,0). This means that the roots of the polynomial are x = -5, x = -1.5, and x = 2.
Thus, the factors of the polynomial are (x - (-5)) = (x+5), (x - (-1.5)) = (x+1.5), and (x - 2).

We can rewrite (x+1.5) as (x + 3/2) or (2x+3)/2.
Thus, the polynomial p(x) can be written as p(x) = a(x+5)(x+1.5)(x-2) = a(x+5)(2x+3)/2(x-2) = (a/2)(x+5)(2x+3)(x-2), where 'a' is some constant.

Let's consider the answer choices:
A: p(x) = (x+5)(2x+3)(x-2)
B: p(x) = (x-5)(2x-3)(x+2)
C: p(x) = (-5x)(-3/2 x)(2x)
D: p(x) = (5x)(3/2 x)(-2x)

Choice A matches the form we derived for p(x).
Choice B has the wrong signs for the roots. If we set p(x) = 0, we get x = 5, x = 3/2, x = -2. These roots do not match the graph.
Choice C has roots at x=0, x=0, x=0. These roots do not match the graph.
Choice D has roots at x=0, x=0, x=0. These roots do not match the graph.

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
