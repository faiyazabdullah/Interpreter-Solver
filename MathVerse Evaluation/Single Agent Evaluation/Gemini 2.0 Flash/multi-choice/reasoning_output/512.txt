GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The line passes through the origin (0,0) and the point (0,-2).  However, this information is insufficient to describe the line. Let's find another point on the line.  We can see that (1, -2.3) lies on the line. The line is dashed, so the inequality will be either > or <.  Since the region shaded is above the line we can say that y > mx.
The slope of the line can be calculated by y2-y1/x2-x1, where two points are (0,0) and (1,-2.3).
So the slope = -2.3-0/1-0 = -2.3

So we can say that y > -2.3x.
