QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, Xiaoqiang made a small hole imaging device in which the length of the paper tube is 15.0. He prepared a candle with a length of 20.0. To get an image with a height of 4.0, the distance between the candle and the paper tube should be ()

CHOICES:
A:60cm
B:65cm
C:70cm
D:75cm

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The small hole imaging principle is similar to similar triangles.
Let the distance between the candle and the paper tube be x. According to the properties of similar triangles:
4/20 = 15/x
x = (20 * 15) / 4
x = 300 / 4
x = 75
Therefore, the distance between the candle and the paper tube should be 75cm.
