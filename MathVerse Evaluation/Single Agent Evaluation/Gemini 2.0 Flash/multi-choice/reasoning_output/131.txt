Since CD is the diameter of the circle and P is a point on the circle, then angle CPD = 90°.
Since angle ACB = 90°, then angle ACB = angle CPD.
Since angle CPD = 90°, then BP is a line segment.
Since angle CPD = 90°, then CP is perpendicular to AD.
Since AC = 6, the minimum length of BP is 2.
Let CD = x.
When BP is at its minimum, AD is perpendicular to BC.
Let CD = x. Since angle C = 90°, AC = 6, then AD = sqrt(AC^2 + CD^2) = sqrt(36 + x^2)
Since angle CPD = 90°, points C, P, D are on the circle.
If CD is the diameter, the center of the circle is at CD/2.
When BP is at its minimum value, BP is perpendicular to AD. In right triangle ACB,
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
Since the minimum length of BP is 2, then BP is perpendicular to AD.
Since angle CPD = 90 degrees, therefore angle APD is also 90 degrees.
Therefore BP is perpendicular to AD.

In right triangle ABC, since AD is perpendicular to BC, CD/AC = BP/AB.
CD/6 = 2/AB
AB * CD = 12
When CD approaches zero, then D approaches C.
Then as D approaches C, BP will be perpendicular to AD.
When BP is at its minimum, AD will be perpendicular to BC.
In this special condition, we can have AC = 6, BP = 2.
Then BC = BD + DC
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
AB^2 = 36 + BC^2

Let AC = 6. Let CD = x. Then AD = sqrt(x^2 + 36).
The area of triangle ACD = 1/2 * AC * CD = 1/2 * AD * CP
Therefore, 6x = sqrt(x^2+36) * CP
CP = 6x / sqrt(x^2 + 36)
BD = BC - CD
AD is perpendicular to BP, then BP = 2.
If D approaches C, CD -> 0. Then BC = sqrt(AB^2 - AC^2)
If D approaches C, then AD approaches AC = 6.
So, if BC is very close to 0. Then AC = AD.
Since AB*CD = 12, BC=CD+BD

As point D approaches point C, AD approaches AC, thus AD = 6.
Since AC = 6, BC -> 0. Since BP = 2, we have.
AB = sqrt(6^2+0^2) = 6

If CD = 2, AD = sqrt(40)
6*2 = CP sqrt(40)
CP = 12/sqrt(40)
When BP is at its minimum, it should be 2.
Then the coordinates for C (0, 0), A (6, 0). B (0, b). CD = x, then D (0, x)
The equation of line AD is y = (-x/6)*(x-6) = (-x/6)*x + x
When BP perpendicular to AD, the line of BP should be (6/x) * x - ?
If BP = 2, b = ?
The locus for point P is a circle with diameter CD.
Then the coordinates for P is (x1, x2).

Consider the limiting case where D coincides with C. Then CD = 0, and P coincides with C. Since the minimum length of BP is 2, BC = 2.
AB = sqrt(AC^2 + BC^2) = sqrt(36 + 4) = sqrt(40) = 2sqrt(10)
