QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What does the average rate of change tell you?

CHOICES:
A:An increase in demand of 500 units will decrease the price of each toy by $\$ 1$
B:An increase in demand of 500 units will increase the price of each toy by $\$ 1$
C:The price of each toy increases by $\$ 0.50$ for each additional 1000 units demanded
D:The price of each toy decreases by $\$ 0.50$ for each additional 1000 units demanded

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Two points on the line are (6, 17) and (16, 22).
The average rate of change is the slope of the line:
(22-17)/(16-6) = 5/10 = 0.5
The average rate of change tells us that for each additional 1000 units demanded, the price of each toy increases by $0.50.
Therefore, the answer is C.

Final Answer: C
