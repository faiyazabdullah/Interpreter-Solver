GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the town be at point O. Let the point 3.2 km due north of the town be point A. Let the clearing be at point B.
The triangle OAB is a right-angled triangle with OA = 3.2 km and AB = 5.9 km. The angle a is the angle at O, between the north direction and the line OB.

We need to find the angle a.
We have tan(a) = opposite/adjacent = AB/OA = 5.9/3.2
a = arctan(5.9/3.2)
a = arctan(1.84375)
a ≈ 61.58 degrees

Rounding to the nearest degree, we have a ≈ 62 degrees.

The bearing of the clearing from the town is a degrees east of north.
The value of a is approximately 62 degrees.
