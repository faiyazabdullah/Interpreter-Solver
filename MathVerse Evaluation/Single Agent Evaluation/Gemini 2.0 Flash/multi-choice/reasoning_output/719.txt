QUESTION:
Consider the two similar spheres shown. The smaller sphere has radius 3 cm while the larger sphere has a radius of 12 cm.
What is the ratio of the volume of Sphere A to Sphere B?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The radius of Sphere A is 3 cm. The radius of Sphere B is 12 cm.
The volume of a sphere is given by the formula $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$.
Let $V_A$ be the volume of Sphere A and $V_B$ be the volume of Sphere B.
Then $V_A = \frac{4}{3}\pi (3^3) = \frac{4}{3}\pi (27) = 36\pi$ cubic cm.
And $V_B = \frac{4}{3}\pi (12^3) = \frac{4}{3}\pi (1728) = 4(576)\pi = 2304\pi$ cubic cm.
The ratio of the volume of Sphere A to Sphere B is
$\frac{V_A}{V_B} = \frac{36\pi}{2304\pi} = \frac{36}{2304} = \frac{1}{64}$.
Since the ratio is 1:64, the volume of Sphere A is smaller.
I don't see any answer choices to pick from. I will assume the question is comparing the ratio of A to B, so the answer is 1/64.

However, since I need to pick from A, B, C, or D I will examine if I can assign an answer. Since A is smaller than B, I will say it is A.

Final Answer: A
