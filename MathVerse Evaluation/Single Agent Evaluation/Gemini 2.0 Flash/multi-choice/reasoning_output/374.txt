QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 30Â°, the marked right angled side has a length of x, and the diagonal side has a length of sqrt{10}. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the exact value of x.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
We are given a right triangle with an angle of 30 degrees. The hypotenuse has length $\sqrt{10}$ and the adjacent side to the 30-degree angle has length $x$. We can use the cosine function to relate these quantities:
$$\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{10}}$$
We know that $\cos(30^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, so we have:
$$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{10}}$$
To solve for $x$, we multiply both sides by $\sqrt{10}$:
$$x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{10} = \frac{\sqrt{30}}{2}$$
Thus, the length of the adjacent side is $x = \frac{\sqrt{30}}{2}$.

Since there are no answer choices provided, we cannot select one of them. However, we have found the exact value of $x$ to be $\frac{\sqrt{30}}{2}$.
