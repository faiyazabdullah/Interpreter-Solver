The image shows a half cylinder with a diameter of 6 cm and a height of 12 cm. We need to calculate the volume of the half cylinder.

The radius of the cylinder is half of the diameter, so the radius is 6 cm / 2 = 3 cm.
The volume of a full cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
The volume of the half cylinder is half of the volume of the full cylinder. So the volume of the half cylinder is V = (1/2)πr^2h.

Substituting the values, we have:
V = (1/2) * π * (3 cm)^2 * (12 cm)
V = (1/2) * π * 9 cm^2 * 12 cm
V = (1/2) * π * 108 cm^3
V = 54π cm^3

Using the value of π ≈ 3.14159, we get:
V ≈ 54 * 3.14159 cm^3
V ≈ 169.646 cm^3

Rounding to one decimal place, we have:
V ≈ 169.6 cm^3
