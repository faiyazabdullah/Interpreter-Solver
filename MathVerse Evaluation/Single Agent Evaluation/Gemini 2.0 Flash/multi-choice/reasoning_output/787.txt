QUESTION:
In the figure above, the smaller circles each have radius 3. They are tangent to the larger circle at points A and C, and are tangent to each other at point B, which is the center of the larger circle. What is the perimeter of the shaded region?

CHOICES:
A.6*\pi
B.8*\pi
C.9*\pi
D.12*\pi
E.15*\pi

The radius of the smaller circles is 3. Since the two smaller circles are tangent to each other at point B, the diameter of each smaller circle is 6. The distance from A to B is 6, and the distance from B to C is 6.
Since B is the center of the larger circle, the radius of the larger circle is AB = BC = 6. The circumference of the larger circle is 2*\pi*6 = 12*\pi.
The perimeter of the shaded region consists of two semi-circles with radius 3, which combined is a circle with radius 3, and half the circumference of the larger circle with radius 6. The circumference of the combined small circles is 2*\pi*3 = 6*\pi. Half the circumference of the larger circle is 1/2 * (2*\pi*6) = 6*\pi.
So the perimeter of the shaded region is 6*\pi + 6*\pi = 12*\pi.
