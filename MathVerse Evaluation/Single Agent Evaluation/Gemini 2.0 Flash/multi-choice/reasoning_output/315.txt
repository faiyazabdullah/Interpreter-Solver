B:6.65
C:8.21
D:8.73

The triangle is isosceles, so the two sides with the tick marks are equal in length. The base angles of an isosceles triangle are also equal. One base angle is given as 48 degrees, so the other base angle is also 48 degrees. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so the top angle is 180 - 48 - 48 = 84 degrees.
We have the base length as 3.5 ft and we want to find the perimeter, so we need to find the length of the equal sides.
Let x be the length of the two equal sides.
Using the Law of Sines:
3.  5/sin(84) = x/sin(48)
x = 3.5 * sin(48) / sin(84)
x = 3.5 * 0.7431 / 0.9945
x = 2.5/0.9945 = 2.6043
The perimeter of the triangle is 3.5 + 2.6043 + 2.6043 = 8.7086
Rounding to the nearest hundredth, the perimeter is 8.71 ft.

The closest answer choice to 8.71 is 8.73.
