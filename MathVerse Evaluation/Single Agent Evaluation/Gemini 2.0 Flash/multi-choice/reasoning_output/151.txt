QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, a student saw a tree by the lake. He visually observed that the distance between himself and the tree is 20.0, and the reflection of the top of the tree in the water is 5.0 far away from him. The student's height is 1.7, and the height of the tree is ( ).

CHOICES:
A:3.4
B:5.1
C:6.8
D:8.5

According to the principle of reflection, the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. Therefore, the angle formed by the student's line of sight to the top of the tree's reflection and the horizontal plane is equal to the angle formed by the line of sight from the top of the tree to its reflection. Thus, the triangle formed by the student, the top of the tree's reflection, and the point on the horizontal plane directly below the student is similar to the triangle formed by the tree, the top of the tree's reflection, and the base of the tree.

Let h be the height of the tree. Then, we can set up a proportion based on similar triangles:
(height of student) / (distance from student to reflection) = (height of tree) / (distance from tree to reflection which is the sum of the student's distance to the reflection and the distance between the student and the tree)

1.  7 / 5 = h / (5 + 20)
1.  7 / 5 = h / 25
h = (1.7 / 5) * 25
h = 1.7 * 5
h = 8.5
