QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, below.


Describe the translation to get from x^2+y^2=4^2 to the circle shown.

CHOICES:
A:The graph has been translated 4 units downwards.
B:The graph has been translated 4 units right.
C:The graph has been translated 4 units left.
D:The graph has been translated 4 units upwards.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The equation x^2 + y^2 = 4^2 represents a circle centered at the origin (0,0) with a radius of 4. The circle in the graph appears to be centered at (0, -4) and has a radius of 4. This means the original circle has been translated downwards by 4 units.

Final Answer: A
