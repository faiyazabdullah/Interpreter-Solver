Let n be the number of sides of the regular polygon.
The measure of each interior angle of a regular n-sided polygon is given by $\frac{(n-2) \times 180^{\circ}}{n}$.
The angles x and y are the exterior angles of the regular polygon. Since the polygon is regular, all exterior angles are equal. Thus, $x = y$.
Given that $x + y = 80^{\circ}$, we have $x + x = 80^{\circ}$, which implies $2x = 80^{\circ}$, so $x = 40^{\circ}$.
The exterior angle of a regular n-sided polygon is $\frac{360^{\circ}}{n}$.
Therefore, we have $x = \frac{360^{\circ}}{n}$. Since $x = 40^{\circ}$, we have $40 = \frac{360}{n}$.
Multiplying both sides by n, we get $40n = 360$.
Dividing both sides by 40, we have $n = \frac{360}{40} = 9$.
Therefore, the number of sides of the regular polygon is 9.
