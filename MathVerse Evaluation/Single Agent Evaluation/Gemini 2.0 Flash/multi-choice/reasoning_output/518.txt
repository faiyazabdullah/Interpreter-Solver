QUESTION:
The graph of $y=2^{x}$ is displayed here, whose y-intercept=1 and all values > 0. Which single option below gives us the graph's domain?

CHOICES:
A.$x \geq 0$
B.$x>0$
C.All real $x$
D.$x<0$

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph of $y=2^{x}$ is displayed. The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (x-values) for which the function is defined. From the graph, we can see that the function is defined for all real values of x. The curve extends infinitely to the left and infinitely to the right. The y-intercept is 1, which means when x=0, y=1. This confirms that x=0 is in the domain. The function is always positive, which means y>0. However, there is no restriction on x. The values of x can be positive, negative, or zero.
A. $x \geq 0$ means x can only be non-negative numbers, which is incorrect.
B. $x>0$ means x can only be positive numbers, which is incorrect.
C. All real $x$ means x can be any real number, which is correct.
D. $x<0$ means x can only be negative numbers, which is incorrect.
