QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a parabola passing (0,2) and it opens upwards, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
A function has an inverse function if and only if it is bijective (both injective and surjective). Injective means that each element of the range is associated with at most one element of the domain (passes the horizontal line test). Surjective means that every element of the codomain is mapped to by at least one element of the domain.

The given graph is a parabola that opens upwards. Parabolas do not pass the horizontal line test. For instance, a horizontal line y=5 will intersect the given parabola at two points. Therefore, a parabola is not injective. Hence, the parabola does not have an inverse function.
