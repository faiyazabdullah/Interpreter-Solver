The problem states that the circle with center O has radius 7, AB is a diameter, and AC = BC. We need to find the area of triangle ABC.

Since AB is a diameter, AB = 2 * radius = 2 * 7 = 14.
Also, since AC = BC, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle.
Since AC = BC and angle ACB is subtended by the diameter AB, angle ACB is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ABC is a right-angled isosceles triangle.
Since AC = BC and triangle ABC is a right triangle, AC and BC are the legs of the right triangle.
Also, since triangle ABC is an isosceles right triangle, AC = BC. Let AC = BC = x.
By the Pythagorean theorem, AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2, so x^2 + x^2 = 14^2, which means 2x^2 = 196.
Therefore, x^2 = 196 / 2 = 98, so x = sqrt(98) = 7 * sqrt(2).
The area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * AC * BC = (1/2) * x * x = (1/2) * x^2 = (1/2) * 98 = 49.
