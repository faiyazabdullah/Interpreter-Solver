QUESTION:
The curve shown in the figure is a quadratic function opening upwards and passes through the origin. Does the graphed function have an even or odd power?

CHOICES:
A:Odd
B:Even

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows a parabola that opens upwards and passes through the origin. The graph is symmetric about the y-axis. This means that for every point (x, y) on the graph, the point (-x, y) is also on the graph. This is a characteristic of even functions. A quadratic function with an even power is of the form $y = ax^2$, where $a$ is a constant. Since the parabola opens upwards, $a > 0$. Because it passes through the origin, the constant term is 0.

Final Answer: B
