QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The x-axis represents Time (minutes) and the y-axis represents Water (liters). The slope is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Archimedes drained the water in his tub.
The amount of water left in the tub (in liters) as a function of time (in minutes) is graphed.
How much water was initially in the tub?

The graph represents the amount of water left in the tub as a function of time. The y-axis represents the amount of water in liters, and the x-axis represents the time in minutes. The graph starts at (0, 360) and ends at (5, 0). The initial amount of water in the tub is the amount of water at time 0. From the graph, we can see that at time 0, the amount of water is 360 liters.
