QUESTION:
There is a curve start from a solid point (1,0) with an end arrow going through (-4,4). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The domain of the function is the set of all possible x-values. From the graph, the x-values start at 1 (inclusive) and go to the left, decreasing without bound. Therefore, the domain is $(-\infty, 1]$.

The range of the function is the set of all possible y-values. From the graph, the y-values start at 0 (inclusive) and go upwards.  The graph shows the y-values increasing without bound. Therefore, the range is $[0, \infty)$.

Final Answer: A
