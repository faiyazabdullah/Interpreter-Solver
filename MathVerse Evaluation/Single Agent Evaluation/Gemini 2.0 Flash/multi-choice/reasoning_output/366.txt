QUESTION:
A ship is 27m away from the bottom of a cliff. A lighthouse is located at the top of the cliff. The ship's distance is 34m from the bottom of the lighthouse and 37m from the top of the lighthouse.
Hence find the height of the lighthouse to the nearest tenth of a metre.

Let $x$ be the height of the cliff, and $y$ be the height of the lighthouse.
We are given that the ship is 27m away from the bottom of the cliff. The distance from the ship to the bottom of the lighthouse is 34m, and the distance from the ship to the top of the lighthouse is 37m.

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the cliff.
$x^2 + 27^2 = 34^2$
$x^2 + 729 = 1156$
$x^2 = 1156 - 729$
$x^2 = 427$
$x = \sqrt{427} \approx 20.6639775$

Now we can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the height of the lighthouse.
$(x+y)^2 + 27^2 = 37^2$
$(x+y)^2 + 729 = 1369$
$(x+y)^2 = 1369 - 729$
$(x+y)^2 = 640$
$x+y = \sqrt{640} \approx 25.2982213$
$y = \sqrt{640} - x \approx 25.2982213 - 20.6639775 \approx 4.6342438$

So the height of the lighthouse is approximately $4.6$ meters.

$x = \sqrt{34^2 - 27^2} = \sqrt{1156 - 729} = \sqrt{427}$
$x+y = \sqrt{37^2 - 27^2} = \sqrt{1369 - 729} = \sqrt{640}$
$y = \sqrt{640} - \sqrt{427} \approx 25.298 - 20.664 = 4.634$
The height of the lighthouse to the nearest tenth of a meter is 4.6 m.
