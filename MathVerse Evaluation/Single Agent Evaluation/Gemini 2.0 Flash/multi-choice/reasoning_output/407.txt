The figure is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 8 cm. The angle between these two sides can be found by considering the third angle of the triangle. Since the triangle is isosceles, the two angles opposite the two sides of length 8 cm are equal. The given angle is 20 degrees, so the other two angles are both $\frac{180 - 20}{2} = \frac{160}{2} = 80$ degrees.
We have a sector with radius 8 cm, and we need to find the arc length. We need to know the angle subtended by the arc, which is $80^{\circ}$. Then the length of the arc is given by
$$ l = r\theta $$
where $\theta$ is in radians. We have $\theta = 80^{\circ} = 80 \cdot \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{4\pi}{9}$ radians. So the arc length is
$$ l = 8 \cdot \frac{4\pi}{9} = \frac{32\pi}{9} \approx 11.1701 $$
The perimeter is the sum of the arc length and the two radii, so
$$ P = 8 + 8 + \frac{32\pi}{9} = 16 + \frac{32\pi}{9} \approx 16 + 11.1701 = 27.1701 $$
Rounding to one decimal place, we get 27.2 cm.
