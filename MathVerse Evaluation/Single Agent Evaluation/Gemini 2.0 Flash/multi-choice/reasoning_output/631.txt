QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=-5\sin x

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph is of y = sin(x). The maximum point is at (90, 1).
The function is y = -5sin(x).
The function sin(x) has a maximum at x=90, where sin(90) = 1.
Then -5sin(x) has a minimum when sin(x) is maximum, so -5(1) = -5. The first minimum will be at x = 90, so (90, -5).
The function -5sin(x) has a maximum when sin(x) is minimum, so -5(-1) = 5. The first maximum will be at x = 270, so (270, 5).
However, sin(x) reaches 0 at 0, 180, 360
-5sin(x) reaches 0 at 0, 180, 360

The graph starts at (0, 0).
At (90, -5), a minimum is reached.
At (180, 0), the x-axis is crossed again.
At (270, 5), a maximum is reached.
At (360, 0), the x-axis is crossed again.

Since the function is y = -5sin(x), the maximum point occurs where sin(x) is minimized. The minimum value of sin(x) is -1 which occurs at x=270. At x=270, y=-5sin(270) = -5(-1) = 5. The maximum point is (270, 5).
