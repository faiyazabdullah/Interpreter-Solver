====================================================================================================
The figure is a triangular prism. We are given that AB = 10, CF = 4, and EF = 15. Also, EX = XF, so X is the midpoint of EF. We want to find the length of CX.

Since X is the midpoint of EF, EX = XF = EF/2 = 15/2 = 7.5.

Consider the right triangle CFX. CF = 4 and XF = 7.5. We are looking for the length of CX, which is the hypotenuse of this right triangle.

By the Pythagorean theorem, $CX^2 = CF^2 + XF^2$.
$CX^2 = 4^2 + (7.5)^2 = 16 + 56.25 = 72.25$
$CX = \sqrt{72.25} = 8.5$

Therefore, the length of CX is 8.5.
