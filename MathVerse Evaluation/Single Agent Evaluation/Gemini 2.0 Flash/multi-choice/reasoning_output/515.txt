QUESTION:
The graph shows the amount of water remaining in a bucket that was initially full before a hole was made in its side. What is the slope of the shown function that passes (0, 30)?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
From the graph, we can identify two points: (0, 30) and (44, 8).  We are asked to find the slope of the line passing through these points.

The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula:
$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

In this case, we have the points (0, 30) and (44, 8), so $x_1 = 0$, $y_1 = 30$, $x_2 = 44$, and $y_2 = 8$.
Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
$m = \frac{8 - 30}{44 - 0} = \frac{-22}{44} = -\frac{1}{2}$
Therefore, the slope of the line is -0.5.

Final Answer: A
