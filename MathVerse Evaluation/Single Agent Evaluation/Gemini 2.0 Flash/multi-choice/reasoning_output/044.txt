QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the two street lamps A and B are separated by 30.0. One night, when Xiaogang went straight 25.0 from the bottom of street lamp A to the bottom of street lamp B, he found that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of street lamp B. It is known that Xiaogang's height is 1.5, then the height of the street lamp is ()

CHOICES:
A:9米
B:8米
C:7米
D:6米

Let the height of the street lamp be $h$. According to the problem, we can use similar triangles to solve it.
The distance between the two street lamps A and B is 30 meters. Xiaogang walked 25 meters from the bottom of street lamp A to the bottom of street lamp B.
Therefore, the distance from Xiaogang to street lamp B is 30 - 25 = 5 meters.
Xiaogang's height is 1.5 meters.
We can establish the following proportion based on similar triangles:
$\frac{1.5}{h} = \frac{5}{30}$
$1.5 \times 30 = 5 \times h$
$45 = 5h$
$h = \frac{45}{5} = 9$
Therefore, the height of the street lamp is 9 meters.
