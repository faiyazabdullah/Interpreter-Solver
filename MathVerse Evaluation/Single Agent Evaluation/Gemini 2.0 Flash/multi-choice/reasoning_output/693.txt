QUESTION:
An empty glass jar weighing 250g is in the shape of a cylinder which has a radius (r) of 15 cm and a height (h) of 26 cm.

Calculate its total weight when it is filled with water, correct to 2 decimal places.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

Given:
Radius of the cylinder (r) = 15 cm
Height of the cylinder (h) = 26 cm
Weight of the empty glass jar = 250 g
Density of water = 1 g/cm³

We need to find the total weight of the jar when it is filled with water.
First, we need to find the volume of the cylinder.
Volume of cylinder = πr²h
Volume = π * (15 cm)² * 26 cm
Volume = π * 225 cm² * 26 cm
Volume = 5850π cm³
Using π ≈ 3.14159265359,
Volume ≈ 5850 * 3.14159265359 cm³
Volume ≈ 18378.32 cm³

Since the density of water is 1 g/cm³, the mass of water that fills the jar is equal to the volume of the jar in cm³.
Mass of water = 18378.32 g

Total weight of the jar filled with water = Weight of empty jar + Mass of water
Total weight = 250 g + 18378.32 g
Total weight = 18628.32 g

Converting to kilograms, we have
Total weight = 18628.32 g / 1000 g/kg = 18.62832 kg

We are asked to calculate the total weight in grams, correct to 2 decimal places.
Total weight = 18628.32 g

The question only requires the calculation to 2 decimal places, so the volume can be determined using π = 3.14
Volume = 5850 * 3.14
Volume = 18329 cm³
Mass of water = 18329 g
Total weight = 250 g + 18329 g = 18579 g
Since we want the total weight in grams correct to 2 decimal places, the answer is 18579.00 g
