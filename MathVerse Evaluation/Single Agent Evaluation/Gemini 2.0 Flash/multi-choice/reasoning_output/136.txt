QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to measure the degree of tree AB, a certain mathematics learning interest group measured the length of the tree's shadow BC in the sun as 9.0. At the same moment, they also measured the shadow length of Xiaoliang in the sun as 1.5. Knowing that Xiaoliang's height is 1.8, then the height of tree AB is ()

CHOICES:
A:10.8m
B:9m
C:7.5m
D:0.3m

According to the question, the height of the tree and the length of its shadow form similar triangles with Xiaoliang's height and the length of Xiaoliang's shadow. Let the height of the tree be $h$. We can set up a proportion:

$\frac{h}{9} = \frac{1.8}{1.5}$

To solve for $h$, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 9:

$h = \frac{1.8}{1.5} \times 9$

$h = \frac{1.8 \times 9}{1.5}$

$h = \frac{16.2}{1.5}$

$h = 10.8$

Therefore, the height of the tree AB is 10.8m.
