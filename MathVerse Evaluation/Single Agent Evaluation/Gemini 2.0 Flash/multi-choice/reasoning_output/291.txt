The image shows a triangle inscribed in a circle. One side of the triangle is a diameter of the circle, and one of the angles is 30 degrees. One of the sides of the triangle is given as 5. Since one side of the triangle is the diameter, the triangle is a right triangle. The diameter is opposite the right angle.

Let the triangle be ABC, where AB is the diameter. Let angle C be the right angle. We are given that angle A is 30 degrees. Then angle B is 180 - 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. Let the side AC be 5.
Then, we have $\tan(60) = \frac{5}{BC}$. Thus, $BC = \frac{5}{\tan(60)} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}$.
Also, $\sin(60) = \frac{5}{AB}$. Thus, $AB = \frac{5}{\sin(60)} = \frac{5}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{3}}$.
The radius of the circle is half of the diameter, so $r = \frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}$.
The area of the circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi (\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}})^2 = \pi \frac{25}{3}$.
The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} (5) (\frac{5}{\sqrt{3}}) = \frac{25}{2\sqrt{3}}$.
The area of the shaded region is the area of the circle minus the area of the triangle.
Area = $\frac{25\pi}{3} - \frac{25}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{25\pi}{3} - \frac{25\sqrt{3}}{6} \approx 26.18 - 7.22 = 18.96$

However, if the side opposite to the 30-degree angle is 5, then we have:
$\sin(30) = \frac{BC}{AB}$. Thus $BC = AB \sin(30) = \frac{1}{2} AB = 5$.
Then the diameter is $AB = 10$, and the radius is $r = 5$.
The area of the circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi (5^2) = 25\pi$.
Since BC = 5, and AB = 10, we can find AC using the Pythagorean theorem:
$AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2$. Thus, $AC^2 + 5^2 = 10^2$, so $AC^2 = 100 - 25 = 75$.
$AC = \sqrt{75} = 5\sqrt{3}$.
The area of the triangle is $\frac{1}{2} (5)(5\sqrt{3}) = \frac{25\sqrt{3}}{2}$.
Area of shaded region = $25\pi - \frac{25\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 25(3.1416) - \frac{25(1.732)}{2} \approx 78.54 - 21.65 = 56.89$
Closest answer is 56.9
