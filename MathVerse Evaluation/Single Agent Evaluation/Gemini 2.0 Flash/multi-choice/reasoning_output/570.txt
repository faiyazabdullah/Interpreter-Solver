GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The function f(x) = x^2 is given as a parabola. We are told that g(x) is a scaled version of f(x). This means g(x) = a*f(x) = a*x^2, for some constant a.

From the graph, we see that the point (2, 3) lies on the graph of g(x).  Thus, g(2) = 3.
Substituting x=2 into the equation g(x) = a*x^2 gives us:
g(2) = a*(2^2) = 4a.
Since g(2) = 3, we have 4a = 3.  Solving for a, we get a = 3/4.

Therefore, the equation for g(x) is g(x) = (3/4)x^2.
