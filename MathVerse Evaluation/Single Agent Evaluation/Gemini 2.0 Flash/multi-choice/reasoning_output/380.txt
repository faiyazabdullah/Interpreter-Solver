GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a right triangle ABC, where angle B is 90 degrees, angle A is 30 degrees, and angle C is 60 degrees. Side AB has length $\sqrt{3}$, and we are asked to find the length of side BC, which is labeled as h.

We can use trigonometric ratios to find h. Since we know the length of the side opposite angle C (AB), and we want to find the length of the side adjacent to angle C (BC), we can use the tangent function:
$\tan(C) = \frac{AB}{BC}$
$\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{h}$

We know that $\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}$, so we have:
$\sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{h}$
Multiplying both sides by h, we get:
$h\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}$
Dividing both sides by $\sqrt{3}$, we get:
$h = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}$
$h = 1$

Final Answer: A
