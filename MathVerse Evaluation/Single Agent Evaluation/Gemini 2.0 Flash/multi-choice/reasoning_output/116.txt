The paper cap is a cone. The area of paper required is the lateral surface area of the cone.
The lateral surface area of a cone is given by πrl, where r is the radius of the base and l is the slant height (generatrix).
We are given the slant height l = 13.0 and the height h = 12.0. We need to find the radius r.
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have r^2 + h^2 = l^2, so r^2 + 12^2 = 13^2, which means r^2 + 144 = 169. Thus, r^2 = 169 - 144 = 25, so r = 5.
The lateral surface area is πrl = π(5)(13) = 65π.
