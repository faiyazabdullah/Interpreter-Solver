AB is perpendicular to BD, CD is perpendicular to BD, EF is perpendicular to BD, so AB || CD || EF.
Therefore, triangles ABE and CDE are similar.
Also, triangles DEF and DAB are similar.
Let EF = x.
Since AB || CD, we have $\frac{BE}{EC} = \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$.
Then $BE = 2EC$, so $BC = BE + EC = 3EC$.
Thus, $\frac{EC}{BC} = \frac{1}{3}$, so $\frac{BE}{BC} = \frac{2}{3}$.
Since EF || AB, triangles CEF and CAB are similar, and triangles BEF and BCD are similar.
From the similarity of triangles DEF and DAB, we have $\frac{EF}{AB} = \frac{DF}{DB}$
From the similarity of triangles BEF and BCD, we have $\frac{EF}{CD} = \frac{BF}{BD}$
Adding the two equations, we have $\frac{EF}{AB} + \frac{EF}{CD} = \frac{DF}{DB} + \frac{BF}{BD} = \frac{DF + BF}{DB} = \frac{BD}{BD} = 1$.
So $\frac{x}{6} + \frac{x}{3} = 1$.
Multiplying by 6, we get $x + 2x = 6$, so $3x = 6$, and $x = 2$.
Therefore, EF = 2.
