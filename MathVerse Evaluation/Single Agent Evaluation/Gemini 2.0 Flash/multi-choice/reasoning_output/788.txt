QUESTION:
In the diagram above, There are two triangles ABC an BDE, where BE is on AB. Angle A is congruent to angle BED, and angle C is congruent to angle D. If the ratio of the length of AB to the length of EB is 5:1, and the area of the triangle BED is 5*a^2 + 10, what is the area of triangle ABC?

CHOICES:
A.5*a^2 + 10
B.25*a^2 + 50
C.25*a^2 + 100
D.125*a^2 + 250
E.cannot be determined

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Given that angle A is congruent to angle BED and angle C is congruent to angle D, the triangles ABC and EBD are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity postulate.

The ratio of the length of AB to the length of EB is given as 5:1.  Therefore, the ratio of corresponding sides is AB/EB = 5/1.
This means the scale factor between triangle ABC and triangle EBD is 5.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.
Area(ABC) / Area(EBD) = (AB/EB)^2 = (5/1)^2 = 25/1

We are given that the area of triangle BED is 5*a^2 + 10.

Therefore, Area(ABC) = 25 * Area(EBD) = 25 * (5*a^2 + 10) = 125*a^2 + 250.

The area of triangle ABC is 125*a^2 + 250. This corresponds to answer choice D.
