QUESTION:
There is a line goes through a hollow point (2,8) and a solid point (8,6). Write the domain and range of each function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a line segment on a coordinate plane. The line segment has an open circle at the point (2, 8) and a closed circle at the point (8, 6).

The domain of the function is the set of all possible x-values. Since the line segment starts at x = 2 (but does not include 2 because of the open circle) and ends at x = 8 (and includes 8 because of the closed circle), the domain is (2, 8].

The range of the function is the set of all possible y-values. Since the line segment starts at y = 8 (but does not include 8 because of the open circle) and ends at y = 6 (and includes 6 because of the closed circle), the range is [6, 8).

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } (2, 8], \quad \text{Range: } [6, 8)$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\text{Domain: } (2, 8], \quad \text{Range: } [6, 8)$
