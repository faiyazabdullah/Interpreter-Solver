QUESTION:
This triangular prism shaped box labelled ABCDEF needs a diagonal support inserted as shown. Find the length AF of this support.
Hence, find the length of AF in terms of AB, BD and DF.

The image shows a triangular prism ABCDEF. We are asked to find the length of the diagonal support AF in terms of AB, BD, and DF.

Since ABCDEF is a triangular prism, we have that the faces ABCD and CDEF are rectangles. Also, triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF.
We are given the length of AF, which is the diagonal support. We want to find the length of AF in terms of AB, BD, and DF.
Notice that ADF is a triangle. However, we don't have any information about the angles.
Also, notice that ACFD is a rectangle, but it is not apparent.
Let us consider the vector $\vec{AF}$.
$\vec{AF} = \vec{AD} + \vec{DF}$. Also, $\vec{AD} = \vec{AB} + \vec{BD}$.
So $\vec{AF} = \vec{AB} + \vec{BD} + \vec{DF}$.
Then $|\vec{AF}|^2 = (\vec{AB} + \vec{BD} + \vec{DF}) \cdot (\vec{AB} + \vec{BD} + \vec{DF})$.
Since the rectangles are orthogonal, $\vec{AB} \cdot \vec{BD} = 0$, $\vec{AB} \cdot \vec{DF} = 0$, and $\vec{BD} \cdot \vec{DF} = 0$.
Thus, $|\vec{AF}|^2 = |\vec{AB}|^2 + |\vec{BD}|^2 + |\vec{DF}|^2$.
So, $AF^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 + DF^2$.
Therefore, $AF = \sqrt{AB^2 + BD^2 + DF^2}$.

Final Answer: $\sqrt{AB^2 + BD^2 + DF^2}$
