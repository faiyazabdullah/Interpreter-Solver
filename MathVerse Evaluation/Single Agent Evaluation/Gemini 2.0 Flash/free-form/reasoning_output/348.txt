QUESTION:
A helicopter is flying at an altitude of 198 metres, at an angle of depression of 44° to its landing pad. What is the distance d between the helicopter and the landing pad?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem describes a right triangle where the height is 198 m, the angle of depression is 44°, and we want to find the distance $d$ between the helicopter and the landing pad, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle.  Since we know the opposite side (height) and we want to find the hypotenuse, we can use the sine function:
$\sin(\text{angle}) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$

In this case, the angle is 44°, the opposite side is 198 m, and the hypotenuse is $d$.  So we have:
$\sin(44^\circ) = \frac{198}{d}$

To solve for $d$, we can multiply both sides by $d$ and then divide by $\sin(44^\circ)$:
$d = \frac{198}{\sin(44^\circ)}$

Now we can calculate the value of $d$:
$d \approx \frac{198}{0.6947} \approx 284.98$

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get $d = 285$.

Final Answer: $285$
