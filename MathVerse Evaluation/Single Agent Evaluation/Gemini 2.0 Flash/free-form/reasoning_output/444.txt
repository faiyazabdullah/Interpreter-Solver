QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\tan a$.

The problem states that the point $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$ lies on the terminal side of an angle $a$ in standard position, and also lies on a circle centered at the origin with radius 1. We want to find $\tan a$.

Since the point $P$ is on the terminal side of angle $a$, and the circle has radius 1, we can identify the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $P$ as the cosine and sine of $a$, respectively. Thus, $\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}$ and $\sin a = \frac{20}{29}$.

The tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the sine to the cosine:
$$ \tan a = \frac{\sin a}{\cos a} $$
Substituting the given values, we have
$$ \tan a = \frac{\frac{20}{29}}{-\frac{21}{29}} = \frac{20}{29} \cdot \left(-\frac{29}{21}\right) = -\frac{20}{21} $$

Final Answer: $-\frac{20}{21}$
