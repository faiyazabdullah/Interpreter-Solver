QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What is the average rate of change?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The average rate of change is the slope of the line.
We can find two points on the line. From the graph, we can estimate the points to be $(6, 17)$ and $(16, 22)$.
The slope of the line is given by the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$.
Plugging in the points, we get $m = \frac{22 - 17}{16 - 6} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.

The average rate of change is $0.5$ dollars per thousand units.

Final Answer: $0.5$
