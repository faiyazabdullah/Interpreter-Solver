QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 50Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.

The problem asks for the true bearing of P from M. The true bearing is the angle measured clockwise from North. From the diagram, we know that the angle PMS is $50^\circ$. Also, the line MS points south. Therefore, the angle between the north direction (opposite to MS) and MP is $180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ$. Since we want the bearing of P from M, we measure the angle clockwise from North at M to the line MP. In this case, it is $180^\circ + 50^\circ$. The bearing of P from M is the angle measured clockwise from North. Since MS points South, the opposite direction points North. The angle between North and MP is $180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ$ measured counter-clockwise. However, bearings are measured clockwise, so we need to measure the angle clockwise.
The clockwise angle is $360^\circ - 130^\circ = 230^\circ$.

Final Answer: $230^\circ$
