QUESTION:
The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows a linear relationship between call length and call cost.
We can pick two points on the line to determine the slope, which represents the average rate of change.
From the graph, we can identify the points $(10, 10)$ and $(20, 19)$.
The average rate of change is given by the slope of the line.
The slope, $m$, is calculated as:
$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$
Using the points $(10, 10)$ and $(20, 19)$:
$m = \frac{19 - 10}{20 - 10} = \frac{9}{10} = 0.9$

The average rate of change is $0.9$ dollars per minute.

Final Answer: $0.9$
