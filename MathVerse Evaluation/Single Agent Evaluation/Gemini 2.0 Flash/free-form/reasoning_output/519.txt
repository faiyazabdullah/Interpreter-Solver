QUESTION:
The function $f(x)=5 x-x^2$ in blue gives the number of mosquitos in the forest (in millions), and the function $g(x)=3 x-0.5 x^2$ in red gives the number of bats (in millions). In both equations $x$ represents rainfall (in centimeters). $g(x)$ goes through (0,0), (3,6), (6,0) and opens downward. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,0), (2,6), (3,6), (5,0) and opens downsward. When there is $0 \mathrm{~cm}$ of rainfall, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats. What is another rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats?
Round your answer to the nearest half centimeter.

The problem states that the number of mosquitos is given by the function $f(x) = 5x - x^2$, and the number of bats is given by the function $g(x) = 3x - 0.5x^2$, where $x$ is the rainfall in centimeters. We want to find the rainfall amount $x$ where the number of mosquitos is equal to the number of bats, i.e., $f(x) = g(x)$.

We have the equation $5x - x^2 = 3x - 0.5x^2$.
Subtracting $3x$ from both sides, we get $2x - x^2 = -0.5x^2$.
Adding $x^2$ to both sides, we get $2x = 0.5x^2$.
Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, we get $0 = 0.5x^2 - 2x$.
Factoring out $x$ from the right side, we get $0 = x(0.5x - 2)$.
Thus, either $x = 0$ or $0.5x - 2 = 0$.
If $0.5x - 2 = 0$, then $0.5x = 2$, which means $x = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4$.
The problem already states that when $x=0$, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats. The other rainfall amount is $x = 4$.
Therefore, when the rainfall is 4 cm, the number of mosquitos and bats is the same.

Final Answer: $4$
