QUESTION:
A pyramid has been removed from a rectangular prism, as shown in the figure. The height of the rectangular prism is 8cm, its length and width are 15cm and 9cm respectively. Find the volume of this composite solid.

Let the dimensions of the rectangular prism be length $l = 15 \text{ cm}$, width $w = 9 \text{ cm}$, and height $h = 8 \text{ cm}$.
The volume of the rectangular prism is given by $V_{\text{prism}} = lwh = (15)(9)(8) = 135(8) = 1080 \text{ cm}^3$.
The pyramid that has been removed has a base that is a triangle. The base of the triangle is $w = 9 \text{ cm}$, and the height of the triangle is half of the length, $l/2 = 15/2 \text{ cm}$. The height of the pyramid is the same as the height of the prism, $h = 8 \text{ cm}$. Since the top edges where equal, the base of the removed pyramid is a triangle with base $w = 9 \text{cm}$ and height $l/2 = 15/2 \text{ cm}$. The volume of the pyramid that has been removed is
$V_{\text{pyramid}} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{base area} \times \text{height}$.
The area of the base of the pyramid is the area of a triangle with base $9 \text{ cm}$ and height $15/2 \text{ cm}$. So, the base area is $\frac{1}{2} \times 9 \times \frac{15}{2} = \frac{135}{4} \text{ cm}^2$.
The height of the pyramid is $8 \text{ cm}$.
Then, $V_{\text{pyramid}} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{135}{4} \times 8 = \frac{135 \times 8}{12} = \frac{1080}{12} = 90 \text{ cm}^3$.
The volume of the remaining solid is $V_{\text{prism}} - V_{\text{pyramid}} = 1080 - 90 = 990 \text{ cm}^3$.

Final Answer: $990 \text{ cm}^3$
