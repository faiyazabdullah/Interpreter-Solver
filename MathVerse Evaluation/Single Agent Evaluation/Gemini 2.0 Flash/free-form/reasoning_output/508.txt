QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the line whose x-intercept is 0.5 and y-intercept is 2. What is the slope of the line?

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The x-intercept is 0.5, which can be written as the coordinate point (0.5, 0).
The y-intercept is 2, which can be written as the coordinate point (0, 2).

To find the slope of the line, we can use the formula:
$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

Using the given points (0.5, 0) and (0, 2), we can plug them into the formula:
$m = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - 0.5} = \frac{2}{-0.5} = -4$

The slope of the line is -4.

Final Answer: $-4$
