QUESTION:
Luke sailed for 116 kilometres on a bearing of 231^\circ .

If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, find $w$ to one decimal place.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

Let the starting point be the origin $(0,0)$. Luke sailed for 116 km on a bearing of $231^\circ$. We want to find how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, which is denoted by $w$.
Let $x$ and $y$ be the coordinates of the point Luke reached.
Then $x = 116 \cos(231^\circ)$ and $y = 116 \sin(231^\circ)$.
Since $231^\circ = 180^\circ + 51^\circ$, we have
$\cos(231^\circ) = \cos(180^\circ + 51^\circ) = -\cos(51^\circ)$
$\sin(231^\circ) = \sin(180^\circ + 51^\circ) = -\sin(51^\circ)$
Therefore, $x = -116 \cos(51^\circ)$ and $y = -116 \sin(51^\circ)$.

We want to find $w$, which is the horizontal distance Luke has sailed from his starting point. Since he sailed on a bearing of $231^\circ$, which is in the third quadrant, the $x$-coordinate will be negative, meaning he sailed west. Thus, $w = -x = 116 \cos(51^\circ)$.

Now, we can calculate the value of $w$:
$w = 116 \cos(51^\circ) \approx 116 \times 0.6293 \approx 72.9988$
Rounding to one decimal place, we have $w \approx 73.0$.

Alternatively, we can consider the angle from the west direction. Since the bearing is $231^\circ$, the angle from the west direction is $231^\circ - 180^\circ = 51^\circ$.
So, $w = 116 \cos(51^\circ) \approx 116 \times 0.6293 \approx 72.9988 \approx 73.0$.

Final Answer: $73.0$
