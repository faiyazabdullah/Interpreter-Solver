QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the base is 14cm. The height of the prism is 3 cm. Find the volume of the prism.

Let the height of the prism be $h_1 = 3 \text{ cm}$. The height of the base is $H = 14 \text{ cm}$. The figure represents a truncated prism.
From the figure, we have two trapezoids. Let's consider the upper part of the figure. The base of the trapezoid is $14 \text{ cm}$ and the top is $3 \text{ cm}$. The height of the trapezoid is $7 \text{ cm}$.
The area of this trapezoid is given by
$A_1 = \frac{1}{2}(14+3) \times 7 = \frac{1}{2}(17)(7) = \frac{119}{2} = 59.5 \text{ cm}^2$.

The volume of the prism is the area of the trapezoid multiplied by the height of the prism.
$\text{Volume} = A_1 \times h_1 = 59.5 \times 3 = 178.5 \text{ cm}^3$.

Let's consider the lower part of the figure. The base of the trapezoid is $5 \text{ cm}$ and the height of the trapezoid is $7 \text{ cm}$. Let the length of the upper side be $x$. However, we don't need this as the upper and lower are connected.
Since the height of the prism is 3 cm, and the height of the base is 14 cm, the volume is the area of the trapezoid multiplied by the prism height of 3 cm.
The area of the trapezoid is $\frac{1}{2}(3+14)(7) = \frac{1}{2}(17)(7) = \frac{119}{2} = 59.5 \text{ cm}^2$.
Thus, the volume of the prism is $59.5 \times 3 = 178.5 \text{ cm}^3$.

Final Answer: $\text{Volume} = 178.5 \text{ cm}^3$
Final Answer: $178.5 \text{ cm}^3$
