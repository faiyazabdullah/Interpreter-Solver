QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the centre of the circle. Write your answer in the form ( _ , _ ).

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The circle in the image intersects the x-axis at two points and the y-axis at two points. The center of the circle appears to be at approximately (-3, -3).
Let's read the coordinates of the center directly from the graph. The x-coordinate of the center appears to be -3, and the y-coordinate of the center appears to be -3. Therefore, the center of the circle is (-3, -3).

Final Answer: $(-3, -3)$
