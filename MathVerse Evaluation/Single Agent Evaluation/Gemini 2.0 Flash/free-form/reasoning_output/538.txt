QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5} \pi, 8\right)$ and again at $\left(\frac{7}{5} \pi, 8\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph represents a trigonometric function. The midline is at $y=8$. The function intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5} \pi, 8\right)$ and $\left(\frac{7}{5} \pi, 8\right)$. The distance between these two points is the difference in their $x$-coordinates, which is $\frac{7}{5}\pi - \frac{3}{5}\pi = \frac{4}{5}\pi$. Since these points are on the midline, they represent half of the period of the function. Thus, half the period is $\frac{4}{5}\pi$.

Therefore, the period is $2 \times \frac{4}{5}\pi = \frac{8}{5}\pi$.

Final Answer: $\frac{8}{5}\pi$
