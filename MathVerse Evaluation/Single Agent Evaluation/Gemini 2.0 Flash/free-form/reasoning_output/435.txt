QUESTION:
Given the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at -0.5 and -3.5 and with y-axis at 2, determine its equation.

The center of the ellipse is the midpoint of the x-intercepts, which are -0.5 and -3.5.
The x-coordinate of the center is $\frac{-0.5 + (-3.5)}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$.
The major axis is along the y-axis.
The y-coordinate of the center is the midpoint of the y-intercepts. We are only given one y-intercept, which is at $y=2$. We need to find the other intercept. The distance from the center to the y-intercept is the same in both directions.
The distance from the center to the y-intercept is the semi-minor axis (b).
The x-intercepts are at -0.5 and -3.5. The semi-major axis (a) is the distance from the center to the x-intercept, which is $|-0.5 - (-2)| = |-0.5 + 2| = |1.5| = 1.5$.
The y-intercept is at y=2. The center is at x=-2. We need to find the coordinates of the center along the y-axis.
Let the center be $(-2, k)$. Then, the intercepts along the y-axis are $2$.
The distance from the center to the y-intercept is the length of the semi-minor axis. The length is $b = |2 - k|$.
The equation of the ellipse is $\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$, where the center is $(h, k)$.
Since the ellipse is more vertically oriented than horizontally, the major axis is vertical. The semi-major axis is $a = 2.5$ and the semi-minor axis is $b = 1.5$. The center is $(-2, 2)$.

The equation of the ellipse is $\frac{(x+2)^2}{1.5^2} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{c^2} = 1$. The center is $(-2, k)$.
The x intercepts occur at $x=-0.5$ and $x=-3.5$. The center is halfway between these intercepts. $\frac{-0.5 - 3.5}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2$.
The center occurs at $x = -2$.
$\frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} + \frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} = 1$.
$h=-2$. We know one point is $(0, 2)$, so $\frac{(0+2)^2}{b^2} + \frac{(2 - k)^2}{a^2} = 1$. We also know $x = -0.5$ and $x=-3.5$ are intercepts.
The intercepts on the x-axis are when $y=0$, so $\frac{(x+2)^2}{b^2} + \frac{(0-k)^2}{a^2} = 1$. Thus, the x-intercepts give us the distance to the major axis.
So $a = |-0.5+2| = 1.5$ or $a = |-3.5+2| = 1.5$.
$\frac{(x+2)^2}{(1.5)^2} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{a^2} = 1$.
The semi-major axis is $\frac{5}{2}$ in the y-direction.
The center is $(-2, 2)$.
$\frac{(x+2)^2}{(\frac{3}{2})^2} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{(\frac{5}{2})^2} = 1$
$\frac{(x+2)^2}{9/4} + \frac{(y-2)^2}{25/4} = 1$
$\frac{4(x+2)^2}{9} + \frac{4(y-2)^2}{25} = 1$

Final Answer: $\frac{4(x+2)^2}{9} + \frac{4(y-2)^2}{25} = 1$
