QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, a marked right angled line has a length of 4 and a slanted line has a length of 4*sqrt{2}. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown \theta . Leave your answer in degrees.

Let the side adjacent to $\theta$ be $x$. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side.
We have $4^2 + x^2 = (4\sqrt{2})^2$.
Then $16 + x^2 = 16(2) = 32$.
So $x^2 = 32 - 16 = 16$.
Therefore, $x = \sqrt{16} = 4$.
Since the adjacent side and the opposite side both have length 4, we have an isosceles right triangle. The angle $\theta$ is opposite the side with length 4 and adjacent to the side with length 4.
We can use the tangent function to find the angle $\theta$.
$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$.
We want to find the angle $\theta$ such that $\tan(\theta) = 1$.
We know that $\tan(45^\circ) = 1$, so $\theta = 45^\circ$.

Final Answer: $45^\circ$
