QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The curve goes through the points (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The x-values range from -4 to 4, and the y-values range from 0 to 2.
Domain: The x-values for which the function is defined. In this case, the curve starts at x = -4 and ends at x = 4, including both endpoints since the points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are solid points. Thus, the domain is [-4, 4].
Range: The y-values that the function takes. In this case, the curve starts at y = 0 and ends at y = 2, including both endpoints. Thus, the range is [0, 2].

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } [-4, 4], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]$
