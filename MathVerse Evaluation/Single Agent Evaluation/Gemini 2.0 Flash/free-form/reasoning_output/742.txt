QUESTION:
A wedding cake consists of three cylinders stacked on top of each other. The top layer has a radius and height of 20 cm, the middle layer has a radius double this, and the same height and the bottom layer has a radius three times as big, and is twice as high.

All the sides and top surfaces are to be covered in icing, but not the bottom.

What is the surface area of the cake that needs to be iced?

Give your answer to the nearest cm2.

Let $r_1, r_2, r_3$ be the radii of the top, middle and bottom cylinders respectively, and $h_1, h_2, h_3$ be the heights of the top, middle and bottom cylinders respectively.
Given: $r_1 = 20 \text{ cm}, h_1 = 20 \text{ cm}$
$r_2 = 2r_1 = 40 \text{ cm}, h_2 = h_1 = 20 \text{ cm}$
$r_3 = 3r_1 = 60 \text{ cm}, h_3 = 2h_1 = 40 \text{ cm}$

We need to find the total surface area of the cake that needs to be iced.
The area to be iced includes the top surface of the top cylinder, the curved surface of each cylinder, and the exposed top surfaces of the middle and bottom cylinders.

Area of the top surface of the top cylinder $= \pi r_1^2 = \pi (20^2) = 400\pi$
Curved surface area of the top cylinder $= 2\pi r_1 h_1 = 2\pi (20)(20) = 800\pi$
Curved surface area of the middle cylinder $= 2\pi r_2 h_2 = 2\pi (40)(20) = 1600\pi$
Curved surface area of the bottom cylinder $= 2\pi r_3 h_3 = 2\pi (60)(40) = 4800\pi$
Exposed area of the top surface of the middle cylinder $= \pi r_2^2 - \pi r_1^2 = \pi (40^2 - 20^2) = \pi (1600 - 400) = 1200\pi$
Exposed area of the top surface of the bottom cylinder $= \pi r_3^2 - \pi r_2^2 = \pi (60^2 - 40^2) = \pi (3600 - 1600) = 2000\pi$

Total surface area to be iced $= \pi r_1^2 + 2\pi r_1 h_1 + 2\pi r_2 h_2 + 2\pi r_3 h_3 + (\pi r_2^2 - \pi r_1^2) + (\pi r_3^2 - \pi r_2^2)$
$= 400\pi + 800\pi + 1600\pi + 4800\pi + 1200\pi + 2000\pi$
$= (400 + 800 + 1600 + 4800 + 1200 + 2000)\pi$
$= 10800\pi$

$10800\pi \approx 10800 \times 3.14159 = 33929.2 \text{ cm}^2$
To the nearest cm$^2$:
$33929 \text{ cm}^2$

Final Answer: $10800\pi$
Final Answer: $33929 \text{cm}^2$
