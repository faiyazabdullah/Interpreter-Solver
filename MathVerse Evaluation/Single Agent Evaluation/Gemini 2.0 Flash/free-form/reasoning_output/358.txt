QUESTION:
Consider the following diagram. The height of the dashed line in the figure is 68. The angle enclosed by the blue arc is 46째, and the angle enclosed by the red arc is 37째. Hence, use the rounded values of y and w to find x, correct to 1 decimal place.

Let's analyze the given diagram. We are given that the height of the rectangle is 68. The angle enclosed by the red arc is 37째, and the angle enclosed by the blue arc is 46째. We are also given that the length of the rectangle is $y$, and the length of the segment from the left side of the rectangle to the dashed line is $w$. The remaining length of the rectangle to the right is $x$. Thus, $y = w + x$. We have $\tan(37^\circ) = \frac{68}{y}$ and $\tan(37^\circ + 46^\circ) = \tan(83^\circ) = \frac{68}{w}$. Thus, $y = \frac{68}{\tan(37^\circ)}$ and $w = \frac{68}{\tan(83^\circ)}$.

Since $y = w + x$, we have $x = y - w$.
$x = \frac{68}{\tan(37^\circ)} - \frac{68}{\tan(83^\circ)}$.
Using a calculator, we have $\tan(37^\circ) \approx 0.75355$, $\tan(83^\circ) \approx 8.14435$.
Therefore, $y = \frac{68}{0.75355} \approx 90.24$, and $w = \frac{68}{8.14435} \approx 8.35$.
$x = 90.24 - 8.35 \approx 81.89$.
Rounding $y$ and $w$ to the nearest integer, we have $y \approx 90$ and $w \approx 8$.
Then $x = y - w = 90 - 8 = 82$.

Now, we are asked to find x correct to 1 decimal place.
$x = \frac{68}{\tan(37^\circ)} - \frac{68}{\tan(83^\circ)} \approx \frac{68}{0.753554} - \frac{68}{8.144346} \approx 90.2417 - 8.3493 = 81.8924$
Therefore, $x \approx 81.9$.

Final Answer: $81.9$
