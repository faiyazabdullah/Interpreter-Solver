QUESTION:
The Cosine function is graphed. It passes through (0,1), (90,0), (180,-1), (270,0), and (360,1). It is symmetric about the y-axis. A black vertex labeled on the function at (0,1). Consider the graph of $y=\cos x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(0^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=\cos \left(x+45^{\circ}\right)$

The given function is $y = \cos(x+45^\circ)$. The original function is $y = \cos(x)$. The transformation that has occurred is a horizontal shift (translation) of the graph $y = \cos(x)$.

The function $y = \cos(x+45^\circ)$ is obtained from $y = \cos(x)$ by replacing $x$ with $x+45^\circ$, which means the graph is shifted $45^\circ$ to the left. The first maximum point of $y = \cos(x)$ for $x \geq 0$ is $(0^\circ, 1)$. Therefore, the first maximum point of $y = \cos(x+45^\circ)$ occurs when $x+45^\circ = 0^\circ$, which means $x = -45^\circ$. However, we want the first maximum point for $x \geq 0$.

Let's consider the graph of $y=\cos(x+45^\circ)$. The maximum value is 1, and it occurs when $x+45^\circ = n \cdot 360^\circ$, where $n$ is an integer. For $n=0$, we have $x = -45^\circ$, which is not in the domain $x \geq 0$. For $n=1$, we have $x + 45^\circ = 360^\circ$, so $x = 360^\circ - 45^\circ = 315^\circ$. Therefore, the first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is $(315^\circ, 1)$. However, the graph $y=\cos(x+45^\circ)$ also has a maximum value 1 when $x=-45^\circ$. Since we want the first maximum for $x\geq 0$, we can consider the graph of $y=\cos(x)$. The maximum occurs when $x=0$ or $x=360^\circ$. The function $y=\cos(x+45^\circ)$ is the same graph but translated $45^\circ$ to the left. Thus the first maximum is at $x=315^\circ$.
However, there is a mistake here. $x+45^\circ = 0$ implies $x=-45^\circ$, so the maximum doesn't occur at the origin.

Since the graph shifts to the left by $45^\circ$, the first maximum point of $y=\cos(x+45^\circ)$ would occur at $x=-45^\circ$ which gives the maximum at $(-45^\circ, 1)$. However, we are looking for a maximum where $x \geq 0$.
We know that the graph repeats every $360^\circ$, so the next time we will obtain a maximum is when $x+45^\circ = 360^\circ$
$x=360^\circ - 45^\circ = 315^\circ$. Hence the coordinates of the maximum are $(315^\circ, 1)$.

Final Answer: $(315^\circ, 1)$
