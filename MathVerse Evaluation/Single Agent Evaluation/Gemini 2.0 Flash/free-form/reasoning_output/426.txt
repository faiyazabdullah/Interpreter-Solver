QUESTION:
On an orienteering course, Valentina runs 550 metres north from point A to point B, then turns east and runs to point C. If the true bearing of C from A is 041 ^\circ T and the direct distance Valentina must run to get back to point A is d metres, find d to the nearest metre.

The problem describes a scenario where Valentina runs from point A to point B, then from point B to point C, forming a right-angled triangle ABC, with a right angle at B. The bearing of C from A is $041^\circ T$, which means the angle between the north direction at A and the line AC is $41^\circ$. The distance AB is 550 metres. We need to find the distance AC, which is denoted as $d$.

Since the bearing of C from A is $41^\circ$, the angle BAC is $41^\circ$. In the right-angled triangle ABC, we have:
$\angle BAC = 41^\circ$
$AB = 550 \text{ m}$
We want to find $AC = d$.

Using trigonometry in the right-angled triangle ABC:
$\cos(\angle BAC) = \frac{AB}{AC}$
$\cos(41^\circ) = \frac{550}{d}$
$d = \frac{550}{\cos(41^\circ)}$

Using a calculator:
$\cos(41^\circ) \approx 0.7547$
$d = \frac{550}{0.7547} \approx 728.61$

Rounding to the nearest metre, we get $d = 729$.

Final Answer: $729$
