The pyramid has a square base with side length 10mm and a perpendicular height of 8mm.
The surface area of the pyramid is the sum of the area of the square base and the areas of the four triangular faces.
The area of the square base is $10^2 = 100 \text{ mm}^2$.
To find the area of each triangular face, we need to find the slant height. We can use the Pythagorean theorem on a right triangle formed by the perpendicular height, half the base side length, and the slant height. Let $s$ be the slant height. Then $s^2 = 8^2 + (10/2)^2 = 8^2 + 5^2 = 64 + 25 = 89$. So, $s = \sqrt{89} \approx 9.43 \text{ mm}$.
The area of each triangular face is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times \sqrt{89} = 5\sqrt{89} \approx 5 \times 9.43 = 47.15 \text{ mm}^2$.
Since there are four triangular faces, their total area is $4 \times 5\sqrt{89} = 20\sqrt{89} \approx 4 \times 47.15 = 188.6 \text{ mm}^2$.
The total surface area of the pyramid is the area of the base plus the area of the four triangular faces: $100 + 4(5\sqrt{89}) = 100 + 20\sqrt{89} \approx 100 + 188.6 = 288.6 \text{ mm}^2$.
Rounding to two decimal places, we have $288.60 \text{ mm}^2$.

Final Answer: $100 + 20\sqrt{89}$
