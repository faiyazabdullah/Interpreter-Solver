QUESTION:
Consider the following diagram. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 38° and angle B is 49°.

Find the true bearing of point C from point B.

Let the bearing of B from A be $\theta_{AB}$, the bearing of C from B be $\theta_{BC}$, and the bearing of A from C be $\theta_{CA}$. The angle at A is $38^\circ$ and the angle at B is $49^\circ$.
In triangle ABC, the sum of angles is $180^\circ$.
Angle C is $180^\circ - 38^\circ - 49^\circ = 180^\circ - 87^\circ = 93^\circ$.

The true bearing of B from A is $38^\circ$. The true bearing of A from B is $180^\circ + 38^\circ = 218^\circ$.
Since the given angle at B is $49^\circ$, the angle between the north direction and the line segment BC is $49^\circ$. The bearing of A from B is $218^\circ$.
Thus, $218^\circ - \theta_{BA} = 49^\circ$, where $\theta_{BA}$ is the angle ABC.

The true bearing of C from B is $\theta_{BC}$. The angle at B is $49^\circ$. The angle between the north direction at B and the line BC is $49^\circ$. We need to find the bearing of C from B. The bearing of A from B is $180^\circ + 38^\circ = 218^\circ$.
Let $\alpha$ be the angle measured clockwise from the north direction at B to the line BC. Then $\alpha = 49^\circ$.
We are looking for the true bearing of C from B, which is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction at B to the line BC. Since the angle at B is $49^\circ$, the angle between the north and BC is $49^\circ$. Therefore, the true bearing of C from B is $49^\circ$.

Final Answer: $49^\circ$
