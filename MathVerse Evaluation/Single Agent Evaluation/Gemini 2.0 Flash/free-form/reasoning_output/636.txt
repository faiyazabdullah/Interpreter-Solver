The image shows a cone with a height of 12m and a slant height of 13m. The radius of the base of the cone is $r$. We need to find the value of $r$. The height, slant height, and radius form a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius $r$.
We have $r^2 + h^2 = l^2$, where $r$ is the radius, $h$ is the height, and $l$ is the slant height. In this case, $h = 12$ and $l = 13$.
So, $r^2 + 12^2 = 13^2$, which means $r^2 + 144 = 169$.
Subtracting 144 from both sides, we get $r^2 = 169 - 144 = 25$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $r = \sqrt{25} = 5$.

Final Answer: $5 \text{m}$
