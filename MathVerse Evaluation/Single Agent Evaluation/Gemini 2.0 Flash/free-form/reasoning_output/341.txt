First, we need to determine the angle at vertex C. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle C is $180^\circ - 42^\circ - 53^\circ = 85^\circ$.

The true bearing of point C from point A is the angle measured clockwise from North to the line segment AC. We know the angle between the North direction at point A and the line segment AB is $42^\circ$. Since we are looking for the true bearing from A to C, we want the angle formed by the North direction at A and AC.

Let the true bearing of B from A be $\theta_{AB}$. Then $\theta_{AB} = 42^\circ$.
Let the true bearing of C from A be $\theta_{AC}$. We need to determine $\theta_{AC}$.

The angle BAC is $42^\circ$. The north direction at A is $0^\circ$ (or $360^\circ$).
The angle at A is $42^\circ$. So, the angle from the North direction to AB is $42^\circ$.
We are looking for the bearing of C from A, which is the angle between the North direction at A and the line AC. This angle is $42^\circ$.
The true bearing of C from A is the angle measured clockwise from North to the line segment AC.

The angle at A is $42^\circ$. So the bearing is $42^\circ + 180^\circ = 222^\circ - 180^\circ - 42^\circ = x$.

The true bearing of point C from point A is found by measuring clockwise from North at A to the line AC. We are given the angle at A to be $42^\circ$.
Consider the triangle ABC. The angle at A is $42^\circ$ and the angle at B is $53^\circ$. The angle at C is $180^\circ - 42^\circ - 53^\circ = 85^\circ$.
The true bearing of C from A is $180^\circ + 42^\circ = 222^\circ$. So, the direction of the line segment AC is $180^\circ - 42^\circ = 138^\circ$. Thus $180^\circ + 42^\circ = 222^\circ$
True bearing of C from A = $0^\circ + 42^\circ = 42^\circ$. This is wrong

The angles are A = 42, B = 53, so C = 85. The true bearing of C from A is 42 + 180 = 222

Final Answer: $222^\circ$
