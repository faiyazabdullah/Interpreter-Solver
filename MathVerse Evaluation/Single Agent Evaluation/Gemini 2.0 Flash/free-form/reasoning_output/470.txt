Let the semicircle be centered at $(h, k)$. From the given points, we observe that the semicircle passes through $(-7, 0)$ and $(7, 0)$. Since the semicircle is symmetric about the y-axis, the center must lie on the y-axis, so $h = 0$. The semicircle also passes through $(0, 7)$.
Therefore, the center of the circle is $(0, k)$ for some value of $k$. The distance from the center to the point $(7, 0)$ must be equal to the distance from the center to the point $(0, 7)$. The distance from $(0, k)$ to $(7, 0)$ is $\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (0-k)^2} = \sqrt{49 + k^2}$. The distance from $(0, k)$ to $(0, 7)$ is $\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (7-k)^2} = \sqrt{(7-k)^2} = |7-k|$.
Since these distances are equal, we have $\sqrt{49 + k^2} = |7-k|$. Squaring both sides, we get $49 + k^2 = (7-k)^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2$. This simplifies to $49 + k^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2$, so $0 = -14k$, which implies $k=0$.
However, the semicircle is above the x-axis, so $k$ must be positive. Since the points $(-7, 0)$ and $(7, 0)$ are on the semicircle, this means that the center must be at $(0, 0)$, which is not possible, since the semicircle is above the x-axis.
We can rewrite the equation of the circle as $x^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(0, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.
We know the point $(7, 0)$ is on the semicircle, so $7^2 + (0-k)^2 = r^2$, or $49 + k^2 = r^2$.
We also know the point $(0, 7)$ is on the semicircle, so $0^2 + (7-k)^2 = r^2$, or $(7-k)^2 = r^2$.
Therefore, $49 + k^2 = (7-k)^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2$, which implies $49 + k^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2$, so $-14k = 0$, and $k = 0$.
Let the center be $(0, k)$ and let the radius be $r$. Then the equation of the circle is $x^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$. We know the points $(-7, 0)$ and $(7, 0)$ are on the semicircle, so $7^2 + (0-k)^2 = r^2$, or $49 + k^2 = r^2$.
We also know that $(0, 7)$ is on the semicircle, so $0^2 + (7-k)^2 = r^2$, which simplifies to $(7-k)^2 = r^2$. Thus, $49 + k^2 = (7-k)^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2$, so $0 = -14k$, and $k = 0$. But this is a contradiction since we know the semicircle lies above the x-axis, so its center cannot be on the x-axis.
The given points seem to imply the radius is 7. The center would be at (0,0) for a full circle of radius 7, which gives us $x^2 + y^2 = 49$. In the semicircle, the center is at (0,0). But the center should be at some height since the semicircle is in the positive y-values. The semicircle should be $x^2+(y-c)^2 = r^2$.
The equation should be $x^2 + (y-c)^2 = r^2$. Substituting (7, 0): $49 + c^2 = r^2$. Substituting (0, 7): $(7-c)^2 = r^2$. Thus, $49 + c^2 = (7-c)^2 \implies 49 + c^2 = 49 - 14c + c^2 \implies 0 = -14c \implies c=0$. This is not correct. The radius seems to be 7.
