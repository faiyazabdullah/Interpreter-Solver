QUESTION:
The graph shows $y_1=x^3$ passing (0,0) and a vertical or horizontal translation $y_2$ passing (-2,0). The blue line is solid while the red line is dotted. Write an equation for $y_2$ as shown in the graph.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

We are given the equation $y_1 = x^3$. The graph shows a translated version of this equation, $y_2$, which passes through the point $(-2, 0)$. This indicates a horizontal translation of $x^3$.

Since $y_1 = x^3$ passes through $(0, 0)$, and $y_2$ passes through $(-2, 0)$, we can see that $y_2$ is a horizontal translation of $y_1$ by $-2$. That means we replace $x$ with $x+2$ in the original function $y_1 = x^3$. Therefore, the equation for $y_2$ is $y_2 = (x+2)^3$.

Final Answer: $y_2 = (x+2)^3$

====================================================================================================
EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $y_2 = (x+2)^3$
