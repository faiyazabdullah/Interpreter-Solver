QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the radius of the circle.

The circle appears to have its center at approximately $(-4, -3)$. The circle intersects the y-axis at around y=-1, and the x-axis between -7 and -1.
Let's approximate the radius. The center of the circle is at approximately $(-4, -3)$.
The top of the circle appears to be at approximately $y=-1$, and the bottom of the circle at approximately $y=-5$. Thus, the distance from the center to the top is $r \approx -1 - (-3) = 2$.
Similarly, the distance from the center to the bottom is $r \approx -3 - (-5) = 2$.
The left side of the circle appears to be at approximately $x=-6$, and the right side of the circle appears to be at approximately $x=-2$. Thus, the distance from the center to the left is $r \approx -4 - (-6) = 2$.
Similarly, the distance from the center to the right is $r \approx -2 - (-4) = 2$.
Therefore, it looks like the radius of the circle is approximately 2.

Consider the circle equation: $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h, k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius.
The center of the circle is at $(-4,-3)$. The equation is then $(x+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = r^2$.
The circle intersects the y-axis at around -1, so when $x=0$, $y=-1$:
$(0+4)^2 + (-1+3)^2 = r^2$
$16 + 4 = r^2$
$20 = r^2$
$r = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \approx 4.472$. This seems to be too large, as it doesn't look like the x-intercepts would be around $x=-4 \pm \sqrt{20}$.

From the image, the circle passes approximately through the point (-2, -3). In this case, the distance from (-4, -3) to (-2, -3) is $|-2 - (-4)| = |-2+4| = 2$.
The circle also appears to pass through the point (-4, -1). In this case, the distance from (-4, -3) to (-4, -1) is $|-1 - (-3)| = |-1+3| = 2$.
So the radius is indeed 2.
So the equation of the circle is $(x+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 2^2 = 4$.
If $x = 0$, we have $16 + (y+3)^2 = 4$, so $(y+3)^2 = -12$. This can't happen! Therefore, the circle in the diagram cannot have radius 2.

Let us consider again that the circle has its center at approximately $(-4, -3)$. From the plot, we can estimate that the x-intercepts are around -6 and -2.
If the radius is 2, we would get $(x+4)^2+(y+3)^2 = 4$. Let y=0. Then $(x+4)^2 = -5$.
If the center is (-4, -3) and the radius is approximately 2, then the circle equation is $(x+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = r^2$.
The intersection points with the y-axis are such that $(0+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = r^2$, so $(y+3)^2 = r^2 - 16$.
Based on the image, $y$ could be close to -1. Thus, $(-1+3)^2 = 4 = r^2 - 16$. So $r^2 = 20$, and $r = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}$.

We need to find a clearer way to determine r.
Let's assume that the center is exactly at (-4,-3) and the top of the circle is (-4,-1). Then r is 2.
Since it crosses the x-axis at $x=-6, -2$, $y=0$. $(-6+4)^2 + (0+3)^2 = (-2)^2 + 3^2 = 4+9 = 13$. So radius is $\sqrt{13}$.
Or if $x=-2, (-2+4)^2 + (0+3)^2 = (2)^2 + 3^2 = 4+9=13$. Radius = $\sqrt{13}$.
$3.6$ seems to be a good approximation. The y value should then be such that $16+(y+3)^2 = 13$. This means that $(y+3)^2 = -3$, impossible.

Since the circle intersects x axis, consider (h, 0), where h is the x intercept. The center is (-4, -3). Therefore r = sqrt((h+4)^2 + (0+3)^2). We approximate h to be -2 or -6. If h= -2, r = sqrt((-2+4)^2 + (3)^2) = sqrt(4+9)=sqrt(13). If h = -6, r = sqrt((-6+4)^2 + 9) = sqrt(13).

Final Answer: $\sqrt{13}$
