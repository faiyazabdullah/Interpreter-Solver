QUESTION:
We wish to find the surface area of the shape given, consisting of a hemisphere and a cylinder. The radius is 10.55 mm. The height of cylinder is 33.1 mm.

Hence find the total surface area of the shape, correct to two decimal places.

Let the radius of the hemisphere and cylinder be $r$ and the height of the cylinder be $h$.
From the image, we are given $r = 10.5 \text{ mm}$ and $h = 33.1 \text{ mm}$.
The surface area of a hemisphere is $2\pi r^2$.
The surface area of the curved surface of a cylinder is $2\pi rh$.
The area of the base of the cylinder is $\pi r^2$, but this is not part of the total surface area as it is covered by the hemisphere.

The total surface area of the shape is the sum of the surface area of the hemisphere and the curved surface area of the cylinder.
So, the total surface area is $2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh = 2\pi r(r+h)$.
Substituting the given values, we get:
Total surface area $= 2\pi (10.5)(10.5 + 33.1) = 2\pi (10.5)(43.6) = 2\pi (457.8) = 915.6\pi \text{ mm}^2$.
Now, we need to find the numerical value correct to two decimal places.
Total surface area $= 915.6\pi \approx 915.6 \times 3.14159265359 = 2876.523589 \text{ mm}^2$.
Rounding to two decimal places, we get $2876.52 \text{ mm}^2$.

Final Answer: $\text{Surface Area} = 2876.52 \text{ mm}^2$
Final Answer: $2876.52 \text{ mm}^2$
