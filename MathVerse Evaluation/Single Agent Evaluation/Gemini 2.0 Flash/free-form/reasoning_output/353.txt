QUESTION:
An airplane is currently flying 35^\circ  south of east, as shown in the image.

The control tower orders the plane to change course by turning 7^\circ  to the left. How many degrees south of east is the new course that the plane is ordered to fly?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The airplane is initially flying $35^\circ$ south of east. The control tower orders the plane to change course by turning $7^\circ$ to the left. Since the plane is flying south of east, turning to the left means turning more towards the north. Thus, we subtract $7^\circ$ from the initial angle to find the new angle south of east.

The new angle is $35^\circ - 7^\circ = 28^\circ$. Therefore, the plane is now flying $28^\circ$ south of east.

Final Answer: $28^\circ$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $28^\circ$
