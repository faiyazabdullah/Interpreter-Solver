Let's analyze the trapezoidal prism and calculate its surface area.

The trapezoidal prism has two trapezoidal faces, two rectangular faces (10cm x 10cm and 3cm x 10cm) and one slanted face.

First, let's find the area of the two trapezoidal faces. The trapezoid has bases of 3cm and 13cm and a height of 10cm.
Area of one trapezoid = $\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h = \frac{1}{2}(3 + 13)(10) = \frac{1}{2}(16)(10) = 80 \text{cm}^2$
Since there are two trapezoids, their combined area is $2 \times 80 = 160 \text{cm}^2$.

Next, let's find the area of the two rectangular faces with dimensions 10cm x 10cm and 3cm x 10cm.
Area of the 10cm x 10cm rectangle = $10 \times 10 = 100 \text{cm}^2$.
Area of the 3cm x 10cm rectangle = $3 \times 10 = 30 \text{cm}^2$.

Now, we need to find the length of the slanted side, $y$.  Consider the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular line from the top vertex of the prism.  The base of this triangle is $13-3 = 10$cm. The height is 10cm.
Therefore, $y = \sqrt{10^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2} \text{cm}$.
The area of the slanted face is $10 \times 10\sqrt{2} = 100\sqrt{2} \text{cm}^2$.  $100\sqrt{2} \approx 141.42 \text{cm}^2$

The total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two trapezoids, the two rectangles, and the slanted rectangle.
$\text{Surface Area} = 2(80) + 100 + 30 + 100\sqrt{2} = 160 + 100 + 30 + 100\sqrt{2} = 290 + 100\sqrt{2} \text{cm}^2$
$\text{Surface Area} = 290 + 100\sqrt{2} \approx 290 + 141.42 = 431.42 \text{cm}^2$

Rounded to the nearest one decimal place: $431.4 \text{cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $431.4$
