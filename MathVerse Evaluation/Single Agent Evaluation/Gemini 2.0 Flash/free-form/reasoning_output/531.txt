The graph of the trigonometric function has a maximum point at $(1.2, 5.5)$. The amplitude is 3.5.
The midline equation of the function is the vertical line that passes through the middle of the maximum and minimum values of the function.
The amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum value.
So the maximum value is $5.5$, and the amplitude is $3.5$.
If $y_m$ is the midline equation, then the maximum value is $y_m + \text{amplitude}$, and the minimum value is $y_m - \text{amplitude}$.
We have $y_m + 3.5 = 5.5$, so $y_m = 5.5 - 3.5 = 2$.
The midline equation is $y=2$.

Final Answer: $y=2$
