QUESTION:
The line goes through the origin. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$ and the point $(1, -3)$. Thus, the slope of the line is $m = \frac{-3 - 0}{1 - 0} = -3$. The equation of the line is $y = -3x$.
The line is dashed, so the inequality will be either $y > -3x$ or $y < -3x$.
The region shaded is above the line. Test a point in the shaded region. Let's test the point $(0, 1)$. Plugging in this point into the inequality gives $1 > -3(0)$ or $1 > 0$. This is true, so the inequality is $y > -3x$. We can also write this as $y + 3x > 0$ or $3x + y > 0$.
Since the shaded region is to the right of the line, we can also test the point $(1, 0)$ in the shaded region. Substituting it into the inequality, we get $3(1) + 0 > 0$, which is $3 > 0$. Since the inequality is true, we can be confident in our answer.

Final Answer: $y > -3x$
