QUESTION:
Consider the triangular prism below. Lengths of AB, CF are 10, 4, 15. EX and XF have same length.
Find the length of CX correct to two decimal places.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let ABCD be a rectangle on the top face of the triangular prism. Let EF be a side of the bottom face of the prism. Let X be the midpoint of EF. We are given that AB = 10, CF = 4, and EF = 15. Since X is the midpoint of EF, EX = XF = 15/2 = 7.5.
Let's introduce a coordinate system with F at (0, 0), E at (15, 0), and a point above F at (0, 4). Then, since X is the midpoint of EF, the coordinates of X are (7.5, 0).
Since CF = 4, the coordinates of C are (0, 4). Therefore, the length of CX is
$CX = \sqrt{(7.5 - 0)^2 + (0 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{(7.5)^2 + (4)^2} = \sqrt{56.25 + 16} = \sqrt{72.25} = 8.5$.
Thus, the length of CX is 8.5.

Final Answer: $8.5$
