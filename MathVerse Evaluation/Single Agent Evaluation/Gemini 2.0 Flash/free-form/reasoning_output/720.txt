QUESTION:
Two similar cylinders have volumes of 5760\mathrm{cm}^3 and 90\mathrm{cm}^3.


Find the fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder.

Let $V_1$ be the volume of the larger cylinder and $V_2$ be the volume of the smaller cylinder.
We are given that $V_1 = 5760 \text{cm}^3$ and $V_2 = 90 \text{cm}^3$.
We are asked to find the ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder.
This ratio is $\frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{5760}{90}$.
We simplify the ratio by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by 10:
$\frac{5760}{90} = \frac{576}{9}$

Now, we can divide both numerator and denominator by 9:
$\frac{576}{9} = \frac{64 \times 9}{9} = 64$

Thus, the simplified ratio is $\frac{64}{1}$, or $64$.
The ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder is 64:1, which can be written as 64.

Final Answer: $64$
