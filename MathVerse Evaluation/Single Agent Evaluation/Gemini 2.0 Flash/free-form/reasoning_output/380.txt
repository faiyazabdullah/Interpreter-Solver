QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, one leg measuring \sqrt{3}. Find the length of side h.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given triangle is a right-angled triangle with one acute angle equal to $60^\circ$. Thus, the other acute angle is $90^\circ - 60^\circ = 30^\circ$. The side opposite to the $30^\circ$ angle is given as $\sqrt{3}$. We are asked to find the length of the side $h$, which is adjacent to the $60^\circ$ angle.

We have $\tan(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{h}$.
Since $\tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3}$, we have $\sqrt{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{h}$.
Multiplying both sides by $h$, we get $h\sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3}$.
Dividing both sides by $\sqrt{3}$, we get $h = 1$.

Alternatively, we can use the relationship $\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}$.
Since $\tan(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, we have $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}$.
Multiplying both sides by $\sqrt{3}$, we get $h = 1$.

Another approach is to use the cotangent function. We have $\cot(60^\circ) = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}$.
Since $\cot(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}$, we have $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3}}$.
Multiplying both sides by $\sqrt{3}$, we get $h = 1$.

We can also use the fact that the side opposite the $30^\circ$ angle is $\sqrt{3}$, which means $AB = \sqrt{3}$.
We are looking for the side adjacent to the $60^\circ$ angle, which is $BC = h$.
Since this is a 30-60-90 triangle, we know that the sides are in the ratio $1:\sqrt{3}:2$.
The side opposite the $30^\circ$ angle is $\sqrt{3}$, so the side adjacent to the $30^\circ$ angle is $h = 1$, and the hypotenuse is $2$.
The ratio of the sides is $BC:AB:AC = 1:\sqrt{3}:2$. Since $AB = \sqrt{3}$, we have $h=1$.

Final Answer: $1$
