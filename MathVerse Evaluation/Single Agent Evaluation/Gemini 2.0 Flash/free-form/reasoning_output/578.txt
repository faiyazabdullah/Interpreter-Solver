QUESTION:
Peter received a lump sum payment of $\$ 50000$ for an insurance claim (and decided not to put it in a savings account).

Every month, he withdraws $5 \%$ of the remaining funds.

The funds after $x$ months is shown below. The curve in the graph passes (0,5). y-axis labels"y('0000s)"

How much would the first withdrawal be?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let $P_0$ be the initial lump sum payment, which is $\$50000$.
Every month, Peter withdraws $5\%$ of the remaining funds.
Let $P_n$ be the amount of funds remaining after $n$ months.
The first withdrawal is $5\%$ of the initial amount $P_0$.
The first withdrawal is $0.05 \times P_0 = 0.05 \times 50000 = 2500$.
The funds after $x$ months are shown in the graph. The curve passes through $(0,5)$, where the $y$-axis represents $y ('0000s)$.

The initial amount is $50000$, which corresponds to the point $(0,5)$ on the graph.
The first withdrawal is $5\%$ of the initial amount, which is $0.05 \times 50000 = 2500$.

Final Answer: $2500$
