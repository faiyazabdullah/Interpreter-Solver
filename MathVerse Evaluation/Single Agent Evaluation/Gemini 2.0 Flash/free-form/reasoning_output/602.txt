QUESTION:
A piecewise function, with 2 segments constructed by a line passing (-5,1), (-3,2), and (-1,4) and a line passing (-1,5), (3,3), and (5,1), as shown in the figure. Let $f$ be the function given by the following graph. What is the domain of $f$?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The function $f$ is defined by the graph. The domain of $f$ is the set of all $x$-values for which the function is defined. From the graph, we can see that the function is defined from $x=-5$ to $x=5$. However, there are open circles at $x=-3$ and $x=-1$.
The left segment starts at $x=-5$ with a solid dot, so $-5$ is included in the domain. As $x$ increases to $-3$, there is an open circle at $x=-3$. So $x=-3$ is not included in the domain. Also, between $-5$ and $-3$, all x values are included in the domain. So the domain includes the interval $[-5, -3)$.
There is an open circle at $x=-1$ for the left segment, but a closed dot at $x=-1$ for the right segment, so $-1$ is included in the domain.
The right segment starts at $x=-1$ with a solid dot, so $-1$ is included in the domain. As $x$ increases to $5$, we have a solid dot at $x=5$, so $x=5$ is included in the domain. Between $-1$ and $5$, all x values are included in the domain. So the domain includes the interval $[-1, 5]$.
Therefore, the domain of $f$ is $[-5, -3) \cup [-1, 5]$.

Final Answer: $[-5, -3) \cup [-1, 5]$
