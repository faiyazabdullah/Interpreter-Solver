The true bearing of a point A from point B is the angle, measured clockwise, from the north direction at B to the direction of A. Let the angle we are looking for be $\theta$.
The angle at B is given as $48^\circ$. This angle is formed between the north direction at B and the line BC. The angle between the north direction at B and the line BA is the true bearing of A from B.

The sum of the angles in triangle ABC is $180^\circ$.
Therefore, $\angle C = 180^\circ - \angle A - \angle B = 180^\circ - 37^\circ - 48^\circ = 180^\circ - 85^\circ = 95^\circ$.

We want to find the angle measured clockwise from the north direction at B to the line BA.
Let's call this angle $\theta$.
The angle between the north direction at B and the line BC is $48^\circ$.
The angle $\angle ABC$ is $48^\circ$.
The true bearing of C from B is $48^\circ$.
Let the true bearing of A from B be $\theta$. Then we have
$\theta = 180^\circ + 48^\circ$.

The angle between the north direction at A and AB is $37^\circ$. The angle at A is $37^\circ$. The angle at B is $48^\circ$.
Let the north direction at A be $N_A$.
Let the north direction at B be $N_B$.
We are looking for the true bearing of A from B, which is the angle between the north at B and the line BA, measured clockwise.

Consider the angle between the north at B and the line BC. It is $48^\circ$. The bearing of C from B is $48^\circ$. The bearing of B from A is $37^\circ + 180^\circ$, assuming A is to the west of B.
The angles given are the angles between the north directions and AB and BA, respectively.
We have $\angle ABC = 48^\circ$.
We are looking for the bearing of A from B.
The bearing of A from B is $180^\circ + 48^\circ = 228^\circ$.

The angle between the line AB and the north direction at B is $48^\circ$.
We are looking for the true bearing of A from B. This means we start at the north at B, and go clockwise to the line BA. This is $180^\circ + 48^\circ = 228^\circ$.

Final Answer: $228^\circ$
