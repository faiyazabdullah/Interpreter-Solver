QUESTION:
On the following unit circle, $\theta$ is in radians and $\tan (\theta)=\frac{0.98}{0.2}=4.9$. Without a calculator, evaluate the following expressions to the nearest hundredth or as an exact ratio.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a unit circle with a point $(0.2, 0.98)$ on the circle. The angle $\theta$ is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point $(0.2, 0.98)$. We are given that $\tan(\theta) = \frac{0.98}{0.2} = 4.9$.
We are asked to find the value of $\tan(\theta)$.
Since the problem already gives us the expression and its value, we just need to express that value in LaTeX format.

Final Answer: $4.9$
