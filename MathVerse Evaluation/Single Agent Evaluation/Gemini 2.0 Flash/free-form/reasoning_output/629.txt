QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The x-axis represents Time (minutes) and the y-axis represents Water (liters). The slope is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Archimedes drained the water in his tub.
The amount of water left in the tub (in liters) as a function of time (in minutes) is graphed.
How much water was initially in the tub?

The amount of water left in the tub as a function of time is graphed. The x-axis represents time (minutes) and the y-axis represents water (liters). The question is to find the initial amount of water in the tub. From the graph, at time $t=0$ (initial time), the amount of water is 360 liters. This is where the line intersects the y-axis.

Final Answer: $360$
