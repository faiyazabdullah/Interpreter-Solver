The problem asks for the amplitude of a trigonometric function given its midline intersection point $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 3.3\right)$ and a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 9.8)$.

The amplitude of a trigonometric function is half the distance between its maximum and minimum values.  Since we are given the maximum $y$-value as $9.8$, we need to find the minimum $y$-value.  The midline is the horizontal line that is halfway between the maximum and minimum values.  The $y$-value of the midline is given as $3.3$.  Let $M$ be the maximum $y$-value and $m$ be the minimum $y$-value.  Then the midline value is $\frac{M+m}{2}$. We are given that $M = 9.8$, and the midline is $3.3$.  So we have:
$$ \frac{9.8 + m}{2} = 3.3 $$
$$ 9.8 + m = 2(3.3) = 6.6 $$
$$ m = 6.6 - 9.8 = -3.2 $$
The amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum $y$-values, so the amplitude is:
$$ \text{Amplitude} = \frac{M - m}{2} = \frac{9.8 - (-3.2)}{2} = \frac{9.8 + 3.2}{2} = \frac{13}{2} = 6.5 $$
Therefore, the amplitude of the function is $6.5$.

Final Answer: $6.5$
