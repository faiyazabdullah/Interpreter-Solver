QUESTION:
There are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a number line with a hollow circle at -2 and a solid circle at 1. The line between -2 and 1 is shaded. This indicates that the interval includes all numbers between -2 and 1. Since the circle at -2 is hollow, -2 is not included in the interval. Since the circle at 1 is solid, 1 is included in the interval. The interval notation for this set of numbers is $(-2, 1]$.

Final Answer: $(-2, 1]$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $(-2, 1]$
