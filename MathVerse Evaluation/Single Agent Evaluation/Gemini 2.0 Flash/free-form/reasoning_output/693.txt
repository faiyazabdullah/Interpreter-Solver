QUESTION:
An empty glass jar weighing 250g is in the shape of a cylinder which has a radius (r) of 15 cm and a height (h) of 26 cm.

Calculate its total weight when it is filled with water, correct to 2 decimal places.

The problem states that an empty glass jar weighing 250g is in the shape of a cylinder with radius $r = 15 \text{ cm}$ and height $h = 26 \text{ cm}$. We need to calculate the total weight when the jar is filled with water.

First, we need to find the volume of the cylinder. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$.
In our case, $r = 15 \text{ cm}$ and $h = 26 \text{ cm}$.
So, $V = \pi (15^2) (26) = \pi (225)(26) = 5850\pi \text{ cm}^3$.
Since $1 \text{ cm}^3$ of water weighs 1 gram, the weight of the water is equal to the volume in grams.
Weight of water $= 5850\pi \text{ g} \approx 18372.56 \text{ g}$.

The empty jar weighs 250 g.
The total weight when the jar is filled with water is the sum of the weight of the jar and the weight of the water.
Total weight $= 250 \text{ g} + 5850\pi \text{ g} = (250 + 5850\pi) \text{ g}$.
Total weight $\approx 250 \text{ g} + 18372.56 \text{ g} = 18622.56 \text{ g}$.

The problem asks for the total weight correct to 2 decimal places.
So the total weight is approximately $18622.56$ g.

Final Answer: $18622.56 \text{ g}$
