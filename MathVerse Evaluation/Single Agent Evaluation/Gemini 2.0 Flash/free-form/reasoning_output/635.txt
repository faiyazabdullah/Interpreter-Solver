QUESTION:
Consider a cone with slant height 13m and perpendicular height 12m.

Hence, find the length of the diameter of the cone's base.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The image shows a cone with a height of 12 m and a slant height of 13 m. The radius of the base is labeled as $r$. Since the height is perpendicular to the base, we have a right triangle formed by the height, the radius, and the slant height. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius $r$.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the legs and $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the height and the radius are the legs, and the slant height is the hypotenuse. Thus, we have:

$12^2 + r^2 = 13^2$
$144 + r^2 = 169$
$r^2 = 169 - 144$
$r^2 = 25$
$r = \sqrt{25}$
$r = 5 \text{ m}$

Now, we need to find the length of the diameter of the cone's base. The diameter is twice the radius, so:
$d = 2r = 2(5 \text{ m}) = 10 \text{ m}$

Final Answer: $10 \text{ m}$
