QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is 6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the equation of the line be $y = mx + c$.
The x-intercept is -3, which means the line passes through the point $(-3, 0)$.
The y-intercept is 6, which means the line passes through the point $(0, 6)$.
Using these two points, we can find the slope $m$ of the line.
$m = \frac{6 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{6}{3} = 2$
So the equation of the line is $y = 2x + 6$.
Since the line is dashed, the inequality will be either $>$ or $<$.
The region is shaded above the line, so the inequality will be $>$.
The inequality is $y > 2x + 6$.

Alternatively, we can use the intercept form of the line.
The equation of the line is $\frac{x}{-3} + \frac{y}{6} = 1$.
Multiplying by 6, we get $-2x + y = 6$, or $y = 2x + 6$.
Since the line is dashed, the inequality will be either $>$ or $<$.
The region is shaded above the line, so the inequality will be $>$.
The inequality is $y > 2x + 6$.

We can also verify this. The point $(0, 0)$ does not lie in the shaded region.
Substituting $(0, 0)$ into the inequality $y > 2x + 6$, we have $0 > 2(0) + 6$, which means $0 > 6$, which is false.
So the region must be $y > 2x + 6$.

Final Answer: $y > 2x + 6$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $y > 2x + 6$
