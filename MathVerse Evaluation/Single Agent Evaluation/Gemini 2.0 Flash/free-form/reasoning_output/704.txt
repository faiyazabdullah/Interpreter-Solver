Let's analyze the figure and find the surface area of the prism.
The prism consists of two rectangular prisms. The larger prism has dimensions 17 cm x 3 cm x 8 cm, and the smaller prism has dimensions 4 cm x 3 cm x 8 cm. The height of the combined prism is 16 cm. Thus, the large prism only has a height of 8 cm (16 cm - 8 cm).

To find the surface area of the prism, we can calculate the area of each face and add them together.

Front view:
- Large rectangle: $17 \times 8 = 136 \text{ cm}^2$
- Small rectangle: $4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ cm}^2$
- Total front area = $136 + 32 = 168 \text{ cm}^2$

Side view: The thickness of the prism is 3 cm.
- Area = $16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ cm}^2$
The front view also has a side that has a width of 3 cm.
- Area = $8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ cm}^2$

Top view:
- Large rectangle: $17 \times 3 = 51 \text{ cm}^2$
- Small rectangle: $4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ cm}^2$
- Total top area: $51 + 12 = 63 \text{ cm}^2$

The surface area can be calculated by summing the area of each face.
- Two front/back faces: $2 \times (17 \times 8 + 4 \times 8) = 2 \times (136 + 32) = 2 \times 168 = 336 \text{ cm}^2$
- Two side faces: $2 \times 16 \times 3 = 2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ cm}^2$
- Top: $17 \times 3 + 4 \times 3 = 51 + 12 = 63 \text{ cm}^2$
- Bottom: $17 \times 3 = 51 \text{ cm}^2$
- Side face between the two prisms: $8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ cm}^2$
- Small side face on top: $4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ cm}^2$
- Large side face height: $8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ cm}^2$
Total surface area = $336 + 96 + 63 + 51 + 24 + 32 + 24 = 626 \text{ cm}^2$.

Another approach:
The surface area of the large prism is $2(17\times 8 + 17 \times 3 + 8 \times 3) = 2(136 + 51 + 24) = 2(211) = 422 \text{ cm}^2$.
The surface area of the small prism is $2(4\times 8 + 4 \times 3 + 8 \times 3) = 2(32 + 12 + 24) = 2(68) = 136 \text{ cm}^2$.
The overlapping area between the two prisms is $2(3 \times 8) = 2(24) = 48 \text{ cm}^2$.
Total surface area = $422 + 136 - 48 = 500 \text{ cm}^2$???

The front area is $17 \times 8 + 4 \times 8 = 136 + 32 = 168 \text{ cm}^2$. Thus the back area is $168 \text{ cm}^2$.
The area of the side is $16 \times 3 = 48 \text{ cm}^2$.
The area on the other side is $3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ cm}^2 + 3 \times 17 = 51 \text{ cm}^2$
The top surface is $3 \times 17 + 3 \times 4 = 51 + 12 = 63 \text{ cm}^2$. The bottom surface is $3 \times 17 = 51 \text{ cm}^2$.
$2(168) + 2(48) + 63 + 51 = 336 + 96 + 63 + 51 = 546$.
Let's add 24 again because it's a hidden surface. Thus $546 + 24 = 570$.

Final Answer: $570 \text{ cm}^2$
