QUESTION:
A rally car starts at point P and races 191 kilometres south to point Q. Here the car turns west and races for 83 kilometres to point R. At point R the car must turn to head directly back to point P.

What is the compass bearing of R from P? Give your answer to one decimal place.

The rally car starts at point $P$, goes south to point $Q$, then west to point $R$. The distances $PQ$ and $QR$ are given as 191 km and 83 km, respectively. We need to find the compass bearing of $R$ from $P$.
Let $\alpha$ be the angle $\angle RPQ$. The compass bearing of $R$ from $P$ is the angle measured clockwise from the North direction to the line segment $PR$. Since the car moves south from $P$ to $Q$ and then west from $Q$ to $R$, the angle $\angle PQR$ is a right angle.

In the right triangle $\triangle PQR$, we have $PQ = 191$ km and $QR = 83$ km. We can find the angle $\alpha$ using the tangent function:
$$\tan(\alpha) = \frac{QR}{PQ} = \frac{83}{191}$$
So, $\alpha = \arctan\left(\frac{83}{191}\right)$.

The angle $\alpha$ is the angle between the south direction and the line $PR$. To find the compass bearing of $R$ from $P$, we need to find the angle measured clockwise from the north direction to the line $PR$. This is $180^\circ + 90^\circ - (90^\circ - \alpha)$

Since the direction is south, the angle measured from the north is $180^\circ$.
Since we want the direction from $P$ to $R$, and $R$ is to the west of $Q$, the angle between the south direction and the direction to $R$ is $\alpha$. So the bearing is $180^\circ + \alpha$.

$$\alpha = \arctan\left(\frac{83}{191}\right) \approx 23.51^\circ$$

The bearing of R from P is $180^\circ + \alpha \approx 180^\circ + 23.51^\circ \approx 203.51^\circ$.
To one decimal place, the bearing is $203.5^\circ$.

Final Answer: $203.5^\circ$
