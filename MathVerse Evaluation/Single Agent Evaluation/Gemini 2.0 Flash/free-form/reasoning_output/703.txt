QUESTION:
The dimensions of a trapezoidal prism are given in the following diagram (not drawn to scale). A trapezoidal prism consists of two trapezium faces and four rectangular faces. The trapezium face has edges of 10cm, 5cm and 18cm and height of 3cm. The bottom face has edges of 18cm and 8cm.

Find the surface area of the trapezoidal prism.

Let the given trapezoidal prism have two trapezium faces and four rectangular faces.
The trapezium face has edges of 10 cm, 5 cm, and 18 cm, and a height of 3 cm. The bottom face has edges of 18 cm and 8 cm.
The surface area of the trapezoidal prism consists of the areas of the two trapeziums and the areas of the four rectangles.
The area of a trapezium is given by $\frac{1}{2}(a+b)h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the parallel sides and $h$ is the height.
In this case, the area of each trapezium is $\frac{1}{2}(10+18) \times 3 = \frac{1}{2}(28) \times 3 = 14 \times 3 = 42 \text{ cm}^2$.
Since there are two trapeziums, their total area is $2 \times 42 = 84 \text{ cm}^2$.
The four rectangles have dimensions $18 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm}$, $10 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm}$, $5 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm}$, and $5 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm}$.
The area of the rectangle with dimensions $18 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm}$ is $18 \times 8 = 144 \text{ cm}^2$.
The area of the rectangle with dimensions $10 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm}$ is $10 \times 8 = 80 \text{ cm}^2$.
The area of each of the two rectangles with dimensions $5 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm}$ is $5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ cm}^2$.
The total area of the four rectangles is $144 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 304 \text{ cm}^2$.
The surface area of the trapezoidal prism is the sum of the areas of the two trapeziums and the four rectangles, which is $84 + 304 = 388 \text{ cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $388 \text{ cm}^2$
