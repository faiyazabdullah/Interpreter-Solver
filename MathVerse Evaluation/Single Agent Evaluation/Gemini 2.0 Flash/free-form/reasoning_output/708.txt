QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the figure shown. The two marked edges have the same length. The top rectangular prism has sides length of 12cm, 1cm and 1cm. The bottom rectangular prism has sides length of 7cm, 4cm and 1cm.

The figure consists of two rectangular prisms connected together in a T shape. The top prism has dimensions 12cm x 1cm x 1cm, and the bottom prism has dimensions 4cm x 7cm x 1cm.

First, calculate the surface area of the top rectangular prism. The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by the formula $2(lw + lh + wh)$, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height respectively. In this case, l=12cm, w=1cm, and h=1cm. Thus the surface area of the top prism is $2(12*1 + 12*1 + 1*1) = 2(12 + 12 + 1) = 2(25) = 50 \text{cm}^2$.

Next, calculate the surface area of the bottom rectangular prism. Here, l=4cm, w=7cm, and h=1cm. Thus the surface area of the bottom prism is $2(4*7 + 4*1 + 7*1) = 2(28 + 4 + 7) = 2(39) = 78 \text{cm}^2$.

Since the two prisms are connected, we must subtract the area of the faces that are joined together. The area of the face where they are joined is 4cm x 1cm = $4 \text{cm}^2$. This area is present on both the top prism and the bottom prism, so we must subtract $2 * 4 = 8 \text{cm}^2$ from the total surface area.

Therefore, the surface area of the combined figure is the sum of the individual surface areas minus the area of the overlap: $50 + 78 - 8 = 120 \text{cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $120 \text{ cm}^2$
