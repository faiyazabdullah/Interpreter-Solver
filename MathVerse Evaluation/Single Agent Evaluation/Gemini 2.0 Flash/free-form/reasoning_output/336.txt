QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the north direction is 31°.

Find the true bearing of point A from O.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The true bearing of point A from O is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction to the line OA.
In the given diagram, the angle between the line OA and the north direction is $31^\circ$. Since A is to the west of north, we measure the bearing in the anticlockwise direction. The true bearing is measured in the clockwise direction. Therefore, the bearing would be $360^\circ - (180^\circ - (90^\circ - (90^\circ-31^\circ)))$.
Or more simply, if the angle between line OA and the north direction is $31^\circ$ and A is to the west, the bearing will be $360^\circ - (90-90+31)$, which is $360 - (angle AON)$. The point A is located at Northwest quadrant, thus the true bearing of point A from O would be $360^\circ - (90^\circ - (90-31))$. The angle is in the northwest quadrant.
The angle from north to the west is $90^\circ$. The angle between the north and line OA is $31^\circ$. Therefore, the angle from the north measured clockwise is $360 - (90-31)$, so $360-59 = 301^\circ$. No. It's $90+90+90 - 31$, or $270-31$, then, that's not the solution. The bearing has to be $360 - (180^\circ-(90+90-31))$
If the point A is in the North-West quadrant, the true bearing of point A from O would be $360^\circ - (the angle from north to OA) = 360^\circ - $ angle AON $= 360^\circ - 31^\circ = 329^\circ$.
The angle given between line OA and the north direction is 31°.
Since the point A is to the west of North, we subtract this angle from 360°.
The true bearing of A from O is thus $360^\circ - (90^\circ-90^\circ+31^\circ)$.
No. Its not the angle of 31. It's the angle we are looking for which is from north clock wise.
Therefore the angle would be $360^\circ - \alpha = \theta$.
True bearing of point A from O is $360^\circ - 31^\circ$. The true bearing of A from O would be $360^\circ - 31^\circ = 329^\circ$.

Final Answer: $329^\circ$
