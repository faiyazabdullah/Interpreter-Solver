QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (-1,3) and (-1,-3). It's center is at (-1,0) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at (-1,$3\sqrt{2}$) and (-1, -$3\sqrt{2}$). Find the equation of the hyperbola.

The given hyperbola has a center at $(-1, 0)$. The vertices are at $(-1, 3)$ and $(-1, -3)$. The foci are at $(-1, 3\sqrt{2})$ and $(-1, -3\sqrt{2})$.

Since the vertices and foci have the same x-coordinate as the center, this is a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis. The standard form of the equation of a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis and center $(h, k)$ is:
$$ \frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1 $$

Here, the center is $(h, k) = (-1, 0)$, so the equation becomes:
$$ \frac{(y-0)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-(-1))^2}{b^2} = 1 $$
$$ \frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{b^2} = 1 $$

The distance from the center to a vertex is $a$. Since the vertices are at $(-1, 3)$ and $(-1, -3)$, the distance from the center $(-1, 0)$ to a vertex is $a = 3$. Thus, $a^2 = 3^2 = 9$.

The distance from the center to a focus is $c$. Since the foci are at $(-1, 3\sqrt{2})$ and $(-1, -3\sqrt{2})$, the distance from the center $(-1, 0)$ to a focus is $c = 3\sqrt{2}$. Thus, $c^2 = (3\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 \cdot 2 = 18$.

We have the relationship $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Plugging in the values for $c^2$ and $a^2$, we get:
$18 = 9 + b^2$
$b^2 = 18 - 9 = 9$
$b = 3$.

So, $a^2 = 9$ and $b^2 = 9$. The equation of the hyperbola is:
$$ \frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{9} = 1 $$

Final Answer: $\frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{9} = 1$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{9} = 1$
