QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Write the equation of the circle in the form \left(x-h\right)^2+\left(y-k\right)^2=r^2.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The circle appears to be centered at approximately $(-4, -3)$. The circle intersects the x-axis at two points, and the y-axis at two points. Let's estimate the radius. The circle intersects the x-axis at about -1 and -7. Therefore, the diameter along the x-axis is about 6. The radius is therefore 3. The circle intersects the y-axis at about 0 and -6. Therefore, the diameter along the y-axis is about 6. The radius is therefore 3.
Therefore, the equation of the circle is $(x - (-4))^2 + (y - (-3))^2 = 3^2$, which simplifies to $(x+4)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 9$.

Final Answer: $(x+4)^2+(y+3)^2=9$
