QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 30Â°, the marked right angled side has a length of 8.5, and the diagonal side has a length of P. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown P.

The given triangle is a right-angled triangle. Let the side opposite to the $30^\circ$ angle be $a$, the adjacent side be $b$, and the hypotenuse be $P$. We are given that the side opposite to the right angle has a length of $P$, one of the angles is $30^\circ$, and the side opposite to the $30^\circ$ angle has a length of 8.5.
Therefore, $a=8.5$. The hypotenuse is $P$. We can use the sine function to relate the angle, the opposite side, and the hypotenuse.
$\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{a}{P}$
We know that $\sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2}$, so
$\frac{1}{2} = \frac{8.5}{P}$
Multiplying both sides by $2P$, we get
$P = 2(8.5) = 17$
Thus, the length of the hypotenuse is 17.

Final Answer: $17$
