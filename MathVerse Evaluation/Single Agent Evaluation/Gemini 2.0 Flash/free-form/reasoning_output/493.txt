Let's analyze the graph.
The graph consists of two line segments.
The first line segment goes through the points (0, 1) and (1, 0).
The slope of this line is $m_1 = \frac{0-1}{1-0} = -1$.
The y-intercept is 1. So, the equation of the first line is $y = -x + 1$.
This line segment goes from $x=0$ to $x=1$, and it also extends to the left.

The second line segment goes through the points (1, 0) and (3, -2).
The slope of this line is $m_2 = \frac{-2-0}{3-1} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1$.
The equation of the line passing through (1, 0) with slope -1 is $y - 0 = -1(x-1)$ which gives $y = -x + 1$.

The third line segment starts at (3, -2) and goes to the right.
The next point on the graph is (5, 0).
The slope of this line is $m_3 = \frac{0 - (-2)}{5 - 3} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$.
The equation of the line passing through (3, -2) with slope 1 is $y - (-2) = 1(x-3)$ which gives $y = x - 3 - 2$, so $y = x - 5$.

We can write the equation as
$f(x) = -x + 1$ when $x < 3$ and $f(x) = x - 5$ when $x \geq 3$.
Because the slopes are different, the equation should be written as
$f(x) = \begin{cases} -x+1 & x < 3 \\ x-5 & x \geq 3 \end{cases}$
Now consider the absolute value function: $f(x)=a|x-h|+k$.
The vertex is at (3, -2).
Therefore, $h=3$ and $k=-2$.
So $f(x)=a|x-3|-2$.
Plug in the point (1, 0): $0 = a|1-3|-2 = a|-2|-2 = 2a-2$.
Then $2a = 2$ so $a = 1$.
Then $f(x) = |x-3|-2$.

Final Answer: $f(x) = |x-3|-2$
