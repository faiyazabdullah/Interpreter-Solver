QUESTION:
In the figure above, the seven small circles, which have equal radii, and the large circle share only those points on the circles that are marked. Point P is the center of the large circle and PA and PB are radii. The area of the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles?

Let $r$ be the radius of each of the seven small circles.
The radius of the large circle is $3r$.
The area of one small circle is $\pi r^2$.
The area of the shaded portion is made of two parts.
The shaded part at $A$ is $\frac{1}{2}$ of the area of the small circle, so its area is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2$.
The angle $\angle BPA$ is $60^\circ$, since the circles are arranged symmetrically, so the angle between adjacent small circles is $360^\circ/6 = 60^\circ$.
Thus, the shaded part at $B$ is a sector of the large circle with radius $3r$ and angle $60^\circ$, which is $\frac{60}{360} = \frac{1}{6}$ of the large circle. The area of the large circle is $\pi (3r)^2 = 9\pi r^2$. The area of the sector is $\frac{1}{6} \times 9\pi r^2 = \frac{3}{2} \pi r^2$.
Therefore, the area of the shaded portion is $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 + \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \pi r^2 + \frac{3}{2} \pi r^2 = 2\pi r^2$.
The area of the small circle is $\pi r^2$.
We want to find how many times the area of the shaded portion is compared to the area of one of the small circles.
$\frac{2\pi r^2}{\pi r^2} = 2$. The shaded portion is two times the area of one of the small circles.
The area of the shaded area is $\frac{1}{2}\pi r^2 + \frac{1}{6} \pi (3r)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 + \frac{1}{6} (9 \pi r^2) = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 + \frac{3}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{4}{2} \pi r^2 = 2 \pi r^2$.
So the shaded area is twice the area of one of the small circles.
