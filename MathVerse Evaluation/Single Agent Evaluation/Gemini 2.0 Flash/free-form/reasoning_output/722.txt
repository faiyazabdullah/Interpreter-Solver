QUESTION:
A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions. The height of the square pyramid is 5x+7. Length L is the side of the base of the pyramid.

Find an expression for L, in terms of the variable, x.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a square pyramid that is split into two sections. The top section is a smaller square pyramid with height $2x+3$ and base side length of 5. The height of the whole square pyramid is given as $5x+7$ and the base side length of the whole pyramid is L.

Since the top section is similar to the whole pyramid, the ratio of corresponding lengths must be equal. Therefore:

$\frac{\text{height of top pyramid}}{\text{height of whole pyramid}} = \frac{\text{side length of top base}}{\text{side length of whole base}}$

Substituting the given values:

$\frac{2x+3}{5x+7} = \frac{5}{L}$

To find an expression for L in terms of x, we can rearrange the equation:

$L = \frac{5(5x+7)}{2x+3}$
$L = \frac{25x+35}{2x+3}$

Final Answer: $L = \frac{25x+35}{2x+3}$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $L = \frac{25x+35}{2x+3}$
