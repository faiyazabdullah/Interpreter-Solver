QUESTION:
The solid in the figure is constructed by 3 segments, 2 of segments are same cylinder on each side of the solid with radius of 11. The cylinder in the middle has radius of 4. Calculate the volume of the solid. Round your answer to one decimal place.

The solid is composed of two cylinders on the sides and a cylinder in the middle.
The two side cylinders have radius $r_1 = 11/2 = 5.5$ and length $l_1 = 8$.
The middle cylinder has radius $r_2 = 4/2 = 2$ and length $l_2 = 7$.

The volume of the two side cylinders is $2 \cdot \pi r_1^2 l_1 = 2 \cdot \pi (5.5)^2 \cdot 8 = 2 \cdot \pi (30.25) \cdot 8 = 16 \pi (30.25) = 484 \pi$.
The volume of the middle cylinder is $\pi r_2^2 l_2 = \pi (2)^2 \cdot 7 = \pi \cdot 4 \cdot 7 = 28 \pi$.
The total volume is the sum of the volumes of the two side cylinders and the middle cylinder, which is $484 \pi + 28 \pi = 512 \pi$.
The value of $512\pi$ rounded to one decimal place is $512 \times 3.14159265359 \approx 1608.4954386 \approx 1608.5$.

Final Answer: $1608.5$
