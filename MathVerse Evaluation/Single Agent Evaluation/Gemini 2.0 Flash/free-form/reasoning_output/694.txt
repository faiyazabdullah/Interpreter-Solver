QUESTION:
Xavier's mother told him to drink 4 glasses of water each day. She gave him a cylindrical glass with radius 4 cm.

If Xavier follows this drinking routine for a week, how many litres of water would he drink altogether?

Round your answer to one decimal place.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

Let the radius of the cylindrical glass be $r = 4$ cm and the height be $h = 11$ cm.
The volume of the cylindrical glass is given by $V = \pi r^2 h$.
Substituting the given values, we have
$$V = \pi (4^2) (11) = \pi (16)(11) = 176\pi \text{ cm}^3$$
Xavier drinks 4 glasses of water each day, so the total volume of water he drinks in a day is $4V = 4(176\pi) = 704\pi \text{ cm}^3$.
Since he follows this routine for a week, which is 7 days, the total volume of water he drinks in a week is $7(704\pi) = 4928\pi \text{ cm}^3$.
We need to convert this volume to litres. We know that $1 \text{ litre} = 1000 \text{ cm}^3$.
Therefore, the total volume of water in litres is
$$\frac{4928\pi}{1000} = 4.928\pi \text{ litres}$$
Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we have
$$4.928\pi \approx 4.928 \times 3.14159 \approx 15.47027 \text{ litres}$$
Rounding to one decimal place, we get $15.5$ litres.

Final Answer: $15.5$
