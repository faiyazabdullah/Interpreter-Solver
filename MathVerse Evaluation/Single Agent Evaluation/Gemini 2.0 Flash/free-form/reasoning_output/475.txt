GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a number line with a point at 4. A blue arrow starts from 4 and goes to the left, indicating that all numbers less than or equal to 4 are included. Since the point at 4 is solid, it means 4 is included in the interval. Therefore, the set of numbers represented on the number line is all numbers less than or equal to 4. In interval notation, this is $(-\infty, 4]$.

Final Answer: $(-\infty, 4]$
