QUESTION:
Takoda is watching the tides off the coast of Cape Cod. For two days, Takoda records the height of the water, $h$, in feet. His results are shown in the graph below, where $t$ corresponds to the number of hours after 12:00 a.m. According to Takoda's research, approximately how much time passes between two consecutive high tides?

The graph shows the height of the water, $h$, in feet, over time, $t$, in hours. The question asks for the time between two consecutive high tides. We can find this by measuring the distance between two peaks on the graph. The first peak appears to be at approximately $t=4$, the second at approximately $t=16$, the third at approximately $t=28$, and the fourth at approximately $t=40$.
The distance between the first and second peaks is $16-4=12$ hours.
The distance between the second and third peaks is $28-16=12$ hours.
The distance between the third and fourth peaks is $40-28=12$ hours.
Therefore, the time between two consecutive high tides is approximately 12 hours.

Final Answer: $12 \text{ hours}$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $12 \text{ hours}$
