QUESTION:
In remote locations, photographers must keep track of their position from their base. One morning a photographer sets out from base, represented by point B, to the edge of an ice shelf at point S on a bearing of 055°. She then walked on a bearing of 145° to point P, which is 916 metres due east of base.

If the photographer were to walk back to her base from point P, what is the total distance she would have travelled? Round your answer to one decimal place.

Let $B$ be the base, $S$ be the position on the ice shelf, and $P$ be the final position. The bearing of $S$ from $B$ is $055^\circ$, which means $\angle NBS = 55^\circ$, where $N$ is the direction of the North. The bearing of $P$ from $S$ is $145^\circ$, which means the angle between the North direction at $S$ and the line $SP$ is $145^\circ$. Also, $P$ is due east of $B$, so $BP = 916 \text{m}$. We want to find the total distance the photographer traveled, which is $BS + SP + PB$.
Since $P$ is due east of $B$, $\angle EBP = 90^\circ$. Since $\angle NBS = 55^\circ$, we have $\angle SBE = 90^\circ - 55^\circ = 35^\circ$, where $E$ is the East direction at $B$.
At $S$, the bearing of $P$ is $145^\circ$. This means the angle between the North direction and $SP$ is $145^\circ$. Therefore, the angle between the South direction and $SP$ is $180^\circ - 145^\circ = 35^\circ$. So $\angle PSS' = 35^\circ$, where $S'$ is the South direction at $S$.
Since the North direction at $B$ and the North direction at $S$ are parallel, the angle between the East direction at $B$ and the South direction at $S$ is $90^\circ + 90^\circ = 180^\circ$.
$\angle BSP = 180^\circ - \angle SBE - \angle PSS' = ?$
Consider the triangle $\triangle BSP$. We know $BP = 916$. We need to find $\angle SBP$.
Let $S'$ denote the South direction at point $S$. We are given that the bearing from $S$ to $P$ is $145^{\circ}$. Thus $\angle PSS'=35^{\circ}$.
Then $\angle PSB = 180 - 145 - 55+90 = 180^\circ - (180^\circ - 35^\circ) - (90^\circ - 35^\circ) = 180^\circ - 145^\circ - 55^\circ = 180^\circ - (90^\circ+55^\circ)-55^\circ$, but that's not right.
Let's redraw the diagram. Let $\angle SBP = \theta$. Since $P$ is due east of $B$, $\angle EBP = 90^\circ$.
$\angle NBS = 55^\circ$ implies $\angle SBE = 90^\circ - 55^\circ = 35^\circ$.
Since $\angle PSS' = 35^\circ$, the interior angle $\angle BSP$ will be $180 - 145 +55 = 180-90 =40 + 35 = 75+ 2*5$.
$\angle BPS = 145^\circ$.
$\angle PBS = 90-\angle NBS = 180^\circ -145^\circ$. Then, $\angle SBP = 90^{\circ} - \theta$. The given angle, $\angle PSB = 180^{\circ} - angle PSS' - angleNBS'$. $\angle PSS'$ is angle to vertical due South, $= 90-55$.
However we get $35$, so we need to solve the triangle. $\angle PSS' = 180 - 145 = 35$, $Angle at P =55^\circ$ so $\angleBSP=2*55 = 90. so its 55
We use the sine rule:
$\frac{BS}{\sin(\angle BPS)} = \frac{BP}{\sin(\angle BSP)}$
$\frac{SP}{\sin(\angle SBP)} = \frac{BP}{\sin(\angle BSP)}$
The angle at S =180-(90-55)=55
$5.SP = 90$
$90^\circ$. Thus, $\angle PBS = 145$, so 
$\angle SBP =90 ^\circ- 180 =145
$180 = 55 *155 -35$ so $\angle SBP$. since SB 
In $\triangle BSP$, we know $BP = 916$.
The bearing of $S$ from $B$ is $55^\circ$. The bearing of $P$ from $S$ is $145^\circ$.
$\angle SBE = 90 - 55 = 35^\circ$. Also, $\angle PSS' = 180 - 145 = 35^\circ$.
Therefore, $\angle BSP = 180 - (90-35)-35$
$\angle PBS = x$
$\angle BPS = $

$\angle PBS = 145
BS/Sin 20. then 
.
From base $angle =.
