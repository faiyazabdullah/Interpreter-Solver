QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the radius.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The circle intersects the x-axis at approximately -1 and 2 and the y-axis at approximately 2 and -2. Thus the center of the circle is approximately $(0.5, 0)$. The radius of the circle appears to be approximately $1.5$ or $2-0.5 = 1.5$. The radius is the distance from the center to any point on the circle. From the graph, the coordinates of the rightmost point on the circle is approximately $(2, 0)$. So, the radius would be $2 - 0.5 = 1.5$. The upper most point is $(0.5, 2)$. Thus $2-0=2$. The radius should be 1.5.

Final Answer: $1.5$
