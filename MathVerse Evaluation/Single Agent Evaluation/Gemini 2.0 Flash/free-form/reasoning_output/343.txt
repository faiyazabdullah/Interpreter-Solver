QUESTION:
Given the diagram shown, if the bearing of the clearing from the town is aÂ°. Starting from town, heading 3.2 kilometers due north and then 5.9 kilometers due east is clearing. Find a to the nearest degree.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the town be at point O. We are given that the clearing is 3.2 km north and 5.9 km east of the town. This forms a right triangle with legs of length 3.2 km and 5.9 km. The angle $a$ is the angle between the north direction and the direction to the clearing. We want to find this angle $a$.
We have $\tan(a) = \frac{5.9}{3.2}$.
Therefore, $a = \arctan(\frac{5.9}{3.2})$.
$a \approx 61.54^\circ$.
To the nearest degree, $a \approx 62^\circ$.

Final Answer: $62^\circ$
