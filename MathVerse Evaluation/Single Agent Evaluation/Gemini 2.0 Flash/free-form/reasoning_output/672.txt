The composite figure consists of a cone and a hemisphere.
The radius of the cone and the hemisphere is $r = 4 \text{ cm}$.
The perpendicular height of the cone is $h = 10 \text{ cm}$.

The surface area of the cone (excluding the base) is given by $A_\text{cone} = \pi r l$, where $l$ is the slant height.
The slant height $l$ can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2}$.
So, $l = \sqrt{4^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{16 + 100} = \sqrt{116} \approx 10.77 \text{ cm}$.
Therefore, the surface area of the cone is $A_\text{cone} = \pi (4) \sqrt{116} = 4\pi \sqrt{116} \approx 4\pi (10.77) \approx 135.34 \text{ cm}^2$.

The surface area of a hemisphere is given by $A_\text{hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2$.
So, $A_\text{hemisphere} = 2\pi (4^2) = 2\pi (16) = 32\pi \approx 100.53 \text{ cm}^2$.

The surface area of the composite figure is the sum of the surface area of the cone (excluding the base) and the surface area of the hemisphere.
$A_\text{total} = A_\text{cone} + A_\text{hemisphere} = \pi r l + 2\pi r^2 = \pi (4) \sqrt{116} + 2\pi (4^2) = 4\pi \sqrt{116} + 32\pi \approx 135.34 + 100.53 = 235.87 \text{ cm}^2$.

The surface area of the composite figure is approximately $235.87 \text{ cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $235.87 \text{ cm}^2$
