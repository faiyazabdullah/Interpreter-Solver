QUESTION:
The graph shows the temperature of a room after the heater has been turned on. What is the slope of the shown function that passes the point (0, 1)?

Let's analyze the given graph. The graph shows the temperature (in degrees Celsius) as a function of time (in minutes). We are asked to find the slope of the line that passes through the point $(0, 1)$.
From the graph, we can see that the line passes through the points $(0, 1)$ and approximately $(20, 5.3)$.
The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula:
$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$
In this case, we have $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 1)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (20, 5.3)$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
$m = \frac{5.3 - 1}{20 - 0} = \frac{4.3}{20} = 0.215$

Now we write the final answer in the required format.
Final Answer: $0.215$
