The image shows a rectangle divided into three smaller rectangles. The total area of the rectangle is 6096. The area of the first rectangle is $6 \times 1000 = 6000$. The area of the second rectangle is $6 \times 10 = 60$. Let $A$ be the area of the third rectangle. The total area is the sum of the areas of the three rectangles, so $6000 + 60 + A = 6096$. Then $6060 + A = 6096$. Subtracting 6060 from both sides gives $A = 6096 - 6060 = 36$.
The third rectangle has a white square removed from it. The area of the third rectangle is 36. We need to find the remaining area after removing the white square. The side length of the rectangle is 6. The width of the third rectangle is $6096 / 6 = 1016$. So the third rectangle has a side length of 6 and a side length of $\frac{36}{6} = 6$. The third rectangle is a square with side length 6. The white square appears to have a side length of approximately 2.
If the side length of the white square is $s$, then the area is $s^2$. If the side length is 2, then the area is $2^2 = 4$. Then the remaining area would be $36 - 4 = 32$.

However, the question is "How much area is remaining?" and gives the total area as 6096. So, if we're looking for the area of the white box, we can see the area of the full rectangle is $6 \times (1000+10+x) = 6096$ where $x$ is the width of the last box.
$6 \times (1010+x) = 6096$
$1010+x = \frac{6096}{6} = 1016$
$x = 1016-1010 = 6$
So the area of the final box is $6 \times 6 = 36$.

Let's assume the white square is $2 \times 2$. Then the area of the square is 4. So the remaining area in that box is $36-4=32$. However, the question asks for the remaining area of the total area, which is $6096$. Therefore, we need the dimensions of the white box. Let $s$ be the side of the white square. The remaining area would be $6096-s^2$. If we assume the white box to be side 2, then the remaining area is $6096-4=6092$.

The problem states "The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?". Since we are given that the total area is 6096, the remaining area must refer to after the white square is removed. From previous calculations we got that the square's area is 4.
Hence the remaining area is $6096-4=6092$.

Final Answer: $6092$
