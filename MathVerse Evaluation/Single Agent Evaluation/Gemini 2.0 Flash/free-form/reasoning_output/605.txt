QUESTION:
The side profile of a bridge is overlapped with the coordinate axes such that $(x, y)$ represents a point on the arc that is $x$ meters horizontally from one end of the bridge and $y$ meters vertically above the road. The bridge meets the road at coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(100,0)$, with the vertex at (50,50).

Pedestrians are able to climb the full arch of the bridge. Find the average steepness of the climb over the interval $[0,20]$.

The problem asks for the average steepness of the climb over the interval $[0,20]$. Average steepness is the same as average rate of change.
The bridge meets the road at $(0,0)$ and $(100,0)$. The vertex is at $(50,50)$.
Since the vertex is at $(50,50)$, we can model the height of the bridge with a quadratic function of the form $y = a(x-50)^2 + 50$. Since the bridge meets the road at $(0,0)$, we have
$0 = a(0-50)^2 + 50$, so $0 = 2500a + 50$, which means $2500a = -50$, so $a = -\frac{50}{2500} = -\frac{1}{50}$.
Therefore, the equation of the bridge is $y = -\frac{1}{50}(x-50)^2 + 50$.

The average steepness of the climb over the interval $[0,20]$ is given by the average rate of change, which is
$\frac{y(20) - y(0)}{20 - 0}$.
We know $y(0) = 0$. Now we need to find $y(20)$.
$y(20) = -\frac{1}{50}(20-50)^2 + 50 = -\frac{1}{50}(-30)^2 + 50 = -\frac{1}{50}(900) + 50 = -\frac{900}{50} + 50 = -18 + 50 = 32$.
The average steepness is $\frac{32 - 0}{20 - 0} = \frac{32}{20} = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6$.

Final Answer: $\frac{8}{5}$
