The semicircle passes through the points (-7,0), (-5,-5), (0,-7), (5,-5), and (7,0).
The center of the semicircle must lie on the y-axis since the semicircle is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let the center be (0, y). The radius of the semicircle is the distance from the center to any point on the semicircle. Let's use the point (7, 0). Then the radius is $\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (0-y)^2} = \sqrt{49+y^2}$.
Let's also use the point (0,-7). Then the radius is $\sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (-7-y)^2} = \sqrt{(y+7)^2}$.
Therefore, $\sqrt{49+y^2} = \sqrt{(y+7)^2}$. Squaring both sides gives $49+y^2 = (y+7)^2 = y^2+14y+49$. This simplifies to $49+y^2 = y^2+14y+49$, so $0 = 14y$, which gives $y=0$. However, the given points do not satisfy this condition.

The general form of the circle is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where $(h,k)$ is the center and $r$ is the radius. Since the graph is a semicircle, the y-coordinate of the center should be negative.
Let us take the points (-7,0) and (7,0). The midpoint of the line segment joining them is (0,0).
Therefore, the x-coordinate of the center must be 0. Let the center be (0, k).
The radius is the distance from (0, k) to any point on the semicircle.
Then the radius is $\sqrt{(7-0)^2 + (0-k)^2} = \sqrt{49 + k^2}$.
The point (0, -7) is given on the graph. So, $49+k^2 = (k+7)^2 = k^2 + 14k + 49$. Then $0=14k$, so k=0. But this is incorrect since the semicircle is below the x-axis.

From the given points, it appears that the center is (0, -7).
Radius is $\sqrt{(7-0)^2+(0-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{49+49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}$.
For the point (-5, -5), we have $\sqrt{(-5-0)^2 + (-5-(-7))^2} = \sqrt{25 + 4} = \sqrt{29}$.
So, (0,-7) is not the center.
It looks like the center is at $(0,-7)$. The radius would be 7. But the points do not satisfy that.
Let the center be $(0, c)$.
Let's try the points $(-7, 0)$ and $(0, -7)$
Then $r^2 = (-7-0)^2 + (0-c)^2 = 49 + c^2$ and $r^2 = (0-0)^2 + (-7-c)^2 = (7+c)^2 = 49 + 14c + c^2$.
So $49 + c^2 = 49 + 14c + c^2$, which means $14c = 0$ and $c = 0$. But we know that the semicircle lies below the x-axis, so $c$ must be less than 0.
So, if the center is at (0, -7), the equation would be $x^2 + (y+7)^2 = 49$.
If x=5, then $25 + (y+7)^2 = 49$, so $(y+7)^2 = 24$. Then $y+7 = \pm\sqrt{24} = \pm 2\sqrt{6}$.
So $y = -7 \pm 2\sqrt{6}$.
But we are given the point $(5, -5)$.
Since the x-coordinate of the center is 0, the center is (0, y).

The center appears to be (0, -7).

Final Answer: $(0,-7)$
