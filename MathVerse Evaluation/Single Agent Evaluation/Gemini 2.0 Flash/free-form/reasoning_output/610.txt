QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What is the average rate of change?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country over several years. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes. The number of earthquakes appears to be constant at 6 for all the years shown (years 1, 2, 3, and 4).

The average rate of change is the change in the number of earthquakes divided by the change in years.
Since the number of earthquakes is constant, the average rate of change is 0.
For example, between year 1 and year 4, the number of earthquakes is 6 in both years. The change in the number of earthquakes is $6 - 6 = 0$. The change in years is $4 - 1 = 3$. Therefore, the average rate of change is $\frac{0}{3} = 0$.

Final Answer: $0$
