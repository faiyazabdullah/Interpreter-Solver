QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -1.5 and the y-intercept is 3. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

The x-intercept is -1.5 and the y-intercept is 3.

The equation of the line can be found using the two intercepts.
The x-intercept is $(-1.5, 0)$ and the y-intercept is $(0, 3)$.

The slope of the line is:
$m = \frac{3 - 0}{0 - (-1.5)} = \frac{3}{1.5} = 2$
The y-intercept is 3.
So, the equation of the line is:
$y = 2x + 3$

Since the region above the line is shaded, the inequality is:
$y \geq 2x + 3$

Final Answer: $y \geq 2x + 3$
