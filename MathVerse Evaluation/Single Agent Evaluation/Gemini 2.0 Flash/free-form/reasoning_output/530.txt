QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the midline equation of the function?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that runs midway between the maximum and minimum values of the function. The equation of the midline is $y = k$, where $k$ is the average of the maximum and minimum $y$-values.

In this case, the maximum point is $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi, -2.2\right)$ and the minimum point is $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi, -8.5\right)$.
The maximum $y$-value is $-2.2$ and the minimum $y$-value is $-8.5$.
To find the midline, we need to calculate the average of these two values:
$$k = \frac{-2.2 + (-8.5)}{2} = \frac{-10.7}{2} = -5.35$$
Therefore, the equation of the midline is $y = -5.35$.

Final Answer: $y = -5.35$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $y = -5.35$
