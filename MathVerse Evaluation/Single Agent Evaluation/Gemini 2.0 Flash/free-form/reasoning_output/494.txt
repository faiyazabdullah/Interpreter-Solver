QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function combind by straight lines, which goes through (-3, -2), (0, 1), and (-1, 0). Write an equation for the graphed function f.

The graph is a piecewise linear function. Let's analyze the different parts of the graph.
For $x \le -1$, the graph is a line segment. We know two points on this line segment are $(-3, -2)$ and $(-1, 0)$.
The slope of this line segment is $m_1 = \frac{0 - (-2)}{-1 - (-3)} = \frac{2}{2} = 1$.
Using point-slope form with point $(-1, 0)$, we have $y - 0 = 1(x - (-1))$, which simplifies to $y = x + 1$.
So, for $x \le -1$, $f(x) = x+1$.

For $x > -1$, the graph is a line segment. We know two points on this line segment are $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 2)$.
The slope of this line segment is $m_2 = \frac{2 - 1}{1 - 0} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$.
Since the line passes through $(0, 1)$, the y-intercept is 1.
Thus, for $x > -1$, $f(x) = x+1$.

Since both pieces of the function are $x+1$, the function is just $f(x) = x+1$. However, this contradicts the location of the minimum at $(-3, -2)$. We made a mistake.

The minimum point on the graph is $(-3, -2)$. The graph can be represented by the absolute value function.
Let's assume the function is of the form $f(x) = a|x-h|+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex.
In our case, $(h, k) = (-3, -2)$. So, $f(x) = a|x-(-3)| - 2 = a|x+3| - 2$.
The function passes through the point $(-1, 0)$.
$0 = a|-1+3| - 2$
$0 = a|2| - 2$
$0 = 2a - 2$
$2a = 2$
$a = 1$
Thus, $f(x) = |x+3| - 2$.

Let's check if this function works:
At $x = -3$, $f(-3) = |-3+3| - 2 = 0 - 2 = -2$.
At $x = -1$, $f(-1) = |-1+3| - 2 = |2| - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0$.
At $x = 0$, $f(0) = |0+3| - 2 = |3| - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1$.

Final Answer: $f(x) = |x+3| - 2$
