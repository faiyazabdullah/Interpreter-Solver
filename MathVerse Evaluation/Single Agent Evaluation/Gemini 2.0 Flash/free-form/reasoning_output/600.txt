QUESTION:
A rectangle is inscribed between the $x$-axis and the parabola $y=36-x^2$ with one side along the $x$-axis, as shown in the figure below. Let $x$ denote the $x$-coordinate of the point highlighted in the figure. Write the area $A$ of the rectangle as a function of $x$.

Let $x$ be the $x$-coordinate of the point shown in the figure. Since the rectangle is inscribed between the $x$-axis and the parabola $y = 36 - x^2$, with one side along the $x$-axis, the vertices of the rectangle are $(-x, 0)$, $(x, 0)$, $(x, 36-x^2)$, and $(-x, 36-x^2)$.

The width of the rectangle is $x - (-x) = 2x$.
The height of the rectangle is $36 - x^2$.
The area of the rectangle, $A$, is given by the product of its width and height:
$$A(x) = (2x)(36 - x^2) = 72x - 2x^3$$

The domain of $x$ is $0 < x < 6$, since $x$ must be positive and $36-x^2 > 0$, so $x^2 < 36$, which implies $-6 < x < 6$. Therefore, the area $A$ of the rectangle as a function of $x$ is $A(x) = 72x - 2x^3$.

Final Answer: $A(x) = 72x - 2x^3$
