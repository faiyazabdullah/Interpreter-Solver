QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

How much faster is Oliver traveling?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the graph to determine the speeds of Oliver and Justin.
From the graph, we can find two points on each line.

For Oliver, we can take the points (1, 33) and (5, 175).
The speed of Oliver is the slope of the line, which is given by:
$v_{Oliver} = \frac{175 - 33}{5 - 1} = \frac{142}{4} = 35.5$

For Justin, we can take the points (1, 25) and (5, 125).
The speed of Justin is the slope of the line, which is given by:
$v_{Justin} = \frac{125 - 25}{5 - 1} = \frac{100}{4} = 25$

The difference in speeds is $v_{Oliver} - v_{Justin} = 35.5 - 25 = 10.5$.
Therefore, Oliver is traveling 10.5 units faster than Justin.

Final Answer: $10.5$
