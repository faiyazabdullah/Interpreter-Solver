QUESTION:
A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm. We wish to find the surface area of the entire solid. Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object.
What is the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism? Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

The solid consists of a cylinder attached to a rectangular prism. We want to find the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism.

The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm, and 65mm. The cylinder has radius 5mm and height 11mm. The cylinder is attached to one of the faces of the rectangular prism.
The total surface area of the rectangular prism is $2(21 \times 10 + 21 \times 65 + 10 \times 65) = 2(210 + 1365 + 650) = 2(2225) = 4450 \text{mm}^2$.
The area of the circular base of the cylinder is $\pi r^2 = \pi (5^2) = 25\pi \text{mm}^2$.
When the cylinder is attached to the rectangular prism, the circular base covers a circular area on one of the faces. The face on which the cylinder is attached is the one with dimensions 21mm and 65mm. Thus, the area covered is $25\pi \text{mm}^2$.
The exposed area of the rectangular prism is the total surface area minus the area covered by the cylinder.
So, the exposed surface area is $4450 - 25\pi \text{mm}^2$.
Calculating the value: $4450 - 25\pi \approx 4450 - 25(3.14159) \approx 4450 - 78.53975 \approx 4371.46025 \text{mm}^2$.
Rounding to two decimal places, the exposed surface area is $4371.46 \text{mm}^2$.

Final Answer: $4371.46$
