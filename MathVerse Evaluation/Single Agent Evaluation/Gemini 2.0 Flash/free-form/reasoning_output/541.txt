The graph of the trigonometric function has a minimum point at $(1,1.5)$ and an amplitude of 1.5. The midline is the horizontal line that runs midway between the maximum and minimum values of the function.
Since the amplitude is 1.5, the distance from the midline to the minimum value is 1.5, and the distance from the midline to the maximum value is 1.5.
The minimum value of the function is 1.5.
Let the midline be $y=M$. Then, $M - 1.5 = 1.5$, where $M$ is the value of the midline.
Adding 1.5 to both sides, we get $M = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3$.
Alternatively, the maximum value is $1.5 + 2(1.5) = 1.5 + 3 = 4.5$. The midline is the average of the minimum and maximum values.
So the midline is $\frac{1.5 + 4.5}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3$.
Therefore, the equation of the midline is $y=3$.

Final Answer: $y=3$
