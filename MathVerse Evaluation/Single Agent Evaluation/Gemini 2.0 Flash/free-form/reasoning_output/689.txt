QUESTION:
Calculate the volume of the half cylinder with a diameter of 6 cm and a height of 12 cm. Correct to one decimal place.

The figure is a half cylinder with a diameter of 6 cm and a height of 12 cm. The radius is half the diameter, so the radius is $r = \frac{6}{2} = 3$ cm. The height of the cylinder is $h = 12$ cm. The volume of a full cylinder is given by $V = \pi r^2 h$. Since we have a half cylinder, we need to divide the volume of the full cylinder by 2.

So the volume of the half cylinder is $V = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{2} \pi (3^2)(12) = \frac{1}{2} \pi (9)(12) = \frac{1}{2} \pi (108) = 54\pi$.

To get the numerical value correct to one decimal place, we calculate $54\pi \approx 54 \times 3.14159 = 169.64586$. Rounding to one decimal place gives $169.6$.

Thus, the volume of the half cylinder is approximately $169.6 \text{ cm}^3$.

Final Answer: $169.6 \text{ cm}^3$
