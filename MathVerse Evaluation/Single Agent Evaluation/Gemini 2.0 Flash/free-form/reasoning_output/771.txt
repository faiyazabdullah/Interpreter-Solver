GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
We are given a circle with center O and radius 7. AB is a diameter of the circle, which means the length of AB is $2 \times 7 = 14$. Also, we are given that AC = BC, and $\angle ACB = 90^\circ$.
Since AB is a diameter, the angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. Thus, $\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with hypotenuse AB. Since AC = BC, $\triangle ABC$ is also an isosceles triangle. Therefore, $\triangle ABC$ is a right isosceles triangle.
Let $AC = BC = x$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2$, which gives us $x^2 + x^2 = 14^2$, so $2x^2 = 196$, and $x^2 = 98$. Taking the square root of both sides gives $x = \sqrt{98} = \sqrt{49 \times 2} = 7\sqrt{2}$.
The area of $\triangle ABC$ is given by $\frac{1}{2} \times AC \times BC = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times x = \frac{1}{2} x^2 = \frac{1}{2} (98) = 49$.

Final Answer: $49$
