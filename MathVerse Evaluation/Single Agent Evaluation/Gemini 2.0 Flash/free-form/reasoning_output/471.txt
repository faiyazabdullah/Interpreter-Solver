QUESTION:
The following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0).

Find the equation of this semicircle.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The given semicircle passes through the points (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0).
The center of the semicircle is (0,0+r), where r is the radius. Since the semicircle passes through (7,0) and (-7,0), the center of the circle is on the y-axis.
Thus, the center of the circle is at (0,k).

The general form of a circle is $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.
Since the center is on the y-axis, h = 0.
Thus, the equation of the circle is $x^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.

We are given that the circle passes through (7,0).
$7^2 + (0-k)^2 = r^2 \implies 49 + k^2 = r^2$

The circle also passes through (0,7).
$0^2 + (7-k)^2 = r^2 \implies (7-k)^2 = r^2 \implies 49 - 14k + k^2 = r^2$.

Therefore, $49 + k^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2$, which implies $14k = 0 \implies k = 0$.
If $k=0$, then $r^2 = 49 + 0^2 = 49$, so $r=7$.
But then the equation would be $x^2 + y^2 = 49$.
However, this circle does not pass through (-5,5). (-5)^2 + 5^2 = 25 + 25 = 50 \neq 49.
So the center of the semicircle is not at (0,0).

Since we know the semicircle passes through (7,0), (-7,0) and (0,7), we have
$x^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$.
If $x = 7$ and $y = 0$, $7^2 + (0-k)^2 = r^2 \implies 49 + k^2 = r^2$.
If $x = 0$ and $y = 7$, $0^2 + (7-k)^2 = r^2 \implies 49 - 14k + k^2 = r^2$.
Setting them equal, we have $49 + k^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2 \implies 14k = 0$, so $k=0$.
If $x = -5$ and $y=5$, $(-5)^2 + (5-k)^2 = r^2 \implies 25 + (5-k)^2 = r^2$.
We have $49+k^2 = r^2$, so $25 + (5-k)^2 = 49 + k^2$.
$25 + 25 - 10k + k^2 = 49 + k^2 \implies 50 - 10k = 49 \implies 10k = 1 \implies k = 1/10 = 0.1$.
Then $r^2 = 49 + (0.1)^2 = 49 + 0.01 = 49.01$, so $r = \sqrt{49.01} \approx 7.00071$.

If the center is (0,k), then the semicircle has the form $y = k + \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$.
At x=0, y=7. So $7 = k + \sqrt{r^2 - 0^2} = k + r$. So $r = 7 - k$.
At x=7, y=0. So $0 = k + \sqrt{r^2 - 7^2}$. Then $-k = \sqrt{r^2 - 49}$, so $k^2 = r^2 - 49$, or $r^2 = k^2 + 49$.
Therefore, $(7-k)^2 = k^2 + 49$. So $49 - 14k + k^2 = k^2 + 49$.
Thus $-14k = 0$ and $k=0$. But this does not pass through (-5,5).

Since the general form is $x^2+(y-k)^2=r^2$ and $y \geq k$, we solve for y:
$(y-k)^2 = r^2 - x^2 \implies y-k = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$, since we only have the upper half.
$y = k + \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$.
Since it passes through (7,0), $0 = k + \sqrt{r^2 - 49}$. Therefore, $-k = \sqrt{r^2 - 49}$, so $k < 0$ and $k^2 = r^2 - 49$, or $r^2 = k^2 + 49$.
Since it passes through (0,7), $7 = k + \sqrt{r^2 - 0} \implies 7 = k + r$, or $r = 7-k$.
Therefore $r^2 = (7-k)^2 = 49 - 14k + k^2 = k^2 + 49$. So $49 - 14k + k^2 = k^2 + 49$, so $14k = 0$ and $k=0$.
But we saw that $k=0$ does not pass through (-5,5).

The semicircle is centered at (0,7). So $x^2 + (y-7)^2 = 49$.
The semicircle is $y > 7$. So $y = 7 + \sqrt{49-x^2}$. This implies it has its center at y=7. However, the semicircle goes down to y=0. So the radius is 7.
$y = 7 - \sqrt{49-x^2}$.

Final Answer: $y = 7 - \sqrt{49 - x^2}$
