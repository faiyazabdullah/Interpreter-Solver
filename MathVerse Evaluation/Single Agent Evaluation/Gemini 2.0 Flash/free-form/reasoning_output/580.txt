QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?

Let $M(t)$ be the percentage of content Maximilian remembers after $t$ days, and let $L(t)$ be the percentage of content Lucy remembers after $t$ days.
We are given that Maximilian forgets $15\%$ of what he could recount the day before. This means that each day, he remembers $100\% - 15\% = 85\%$ of what he remembered the previous day. Therefore, $M(t) = (0.85)^t \cdot 100\%$.

From the graph, we see that at $t=0$, both Maximilian and Lucy remember $100\%$ of the content. Let $x$ be the percentage of content Lucy remembers each day from the previous day. Then, $L(t) = x^t \cdot 100\%$.
We need to find the value of $x$.
From the graph, we can estimate that after 10 days, Maximilian remembers approximately $20\%$ of the content, and Lucy remembers approximately $25\%$ of the content.
Thus, $M(10) \approx 20\%$ and $L(10) \approx 25\%$.
We have $M(10) = (0.85)^{10} \cdot 100\% \approx 19.687\%$, which is consistent with the graph.
Then, $L(10) = x^{10} \cdot 100\% = 25\%$, so $x^{10} = 0.25$.
Taking the tenth root of both sides, we get $x = (0.25)^{1/10} \approx 0.89526$.
Thus, Lucy remembers approximately $89.526\%$ of the content from the previous day. The percentage of content Lucy forgets each day is $100\% - 89.526\% = 10.474\%$.

Let's estimate $L(t)$ from the graph. The graph shows that $L(0) = 100$.
After some days, Lucy's graph reaches about 50%, so $0.5 = x^t$.
The graph of $M(t)$ and $L(t)$ start at 100. From the given information, Maximilian forgets 15% each day. We are trying to find the percentage Lucy forgets each day.
We have $L(t) = 100 \cdot (1 - p)^t$, where $p$ is the percentage Lucy forgets each day.
$L(1) = 100(1-p) = x$. We need to estimate $x$ from the graph.
We have that Lucy's recall percentage at $t=0$ is $100$, and $M(0) = 100$.
At $t=1$, $M(1) = 0.85 \times 100 = 85$. From the graph, it looks like $L(1) \approx 90$, so $L(1) = 90$.
So, $L(1) = 100(1-p) = 90 \implies 1-p = 0.9$, so $p = 0.1$.
The percentage of content Lucy forgets each day is $10\%$.
This corresponds to $x = 0.9$.
Check for some other value of $t$, e.g. $t=10$. $L(10) = 100(0.9)^{10} = 100(0.3487) = 34.87$. This is higher than what the graph shows ($25$).
Let $L(10) = 25$. Then $(1-p)^{10} = 0.25$, so $1-p = 0.25^{1/10} \approx 0.895$. $p = 1-0.895 = 0.105$.
Percentage of content Lucy forgets is approximately 10.5%.

Final Answer: $10.5\%$
