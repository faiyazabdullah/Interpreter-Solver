QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function going through points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given piecewise function passes through the points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5). The graph extends from x = -3 to approximately x = 8 and the function increases from x = -3 to x = 0 and from x = 3 to approximately x = 8. The function is constant from x = 0 to x = 3. The graph begins at (-3, 0), includes (0, 5) and (3, 5), and extends upwards towards (8, 9.5).

Domain: The domain of the function is the set of all possible x-values. The function starts at x = -3 and appears to continue to x = 8. Therefore, the domain is [-3, 8].
Range: The range of the function is the set of all possible y-values. The minimum y-value is 0, and the maximum y-value is approximately 9.5. The y-value starts at 0 when x is -3 and goes to about 9.5 when x is 8. Therefore, the range is [0, 9.5].

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } [-3, 8], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 9.5]$
