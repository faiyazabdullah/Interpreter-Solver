Let's analyze the given information. Point B is due East of point A. The angle at A in triangle ABC is $49^\circ$ and the angle at B is $39^\circ$. We want to find the true bearing of point A from point C. First, we can find the angle at C in triangle ABC. The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^\circ$.
So, $\angle C = 180^\circ - \angle A - \angle B = 180^\circ - 49^\circ - 39^\circ = 180^\circ - 88^\circ = 92^\circ$.

Now we need to find the angle between the North direction at C and the line CA. Let this angle be $\theta$.
The bearing of B from A is East, so the angle between the North direction at A and the line AB is $90^\circ$.
The angle between the North direction at B and the line BA is $270^\circ$ (or $90^\circ$).
Let $\alpha$ be the angle between the North at C and the line CA.
In the diagram, point B is due East of A, so the line AB is horizontal. We want to find the bearing of A from C.
Let $\theta$ be the bearing of A from C. We are looking for the angle measured clockwise from the North direction at C to the line CA.

Since point B is east of point A, the direction of AB is east.
In triangle ABC, $\angle A = 49^\circ$, $\angle B = 39^\circ$, and $\angle C = 92^\circ$.
The bearing of A from C is the angle formed between the North direction at C and the line CA.
Let's denote the angle we are seeking as $x$.
The north direction at A is $90^\circ$ with respect to AB. The angle between AB and AC is $49^\circ$. So the angle between North at A and AC is $90+180=270$. 270-49.

Let's consider the angle between the line CA and the south direction. Since the bearing of A from C is the angle measured clockwise from North to CA, and we know that $\angle C = 92^\circ$, we need to determine the direction of North at C relative to triangle ABC.

Imagine drawing a line from C to a point due North of C. The angle formed by this North line and the line CB is what we need to determine. Once we determine the angle between North at C and CB, we can determine the bearing of A from C.
Since the bearing of B from A is $90^\circ$ (East), we can determine the bearing of A from B, which is $270^\circ$ (West).

Consider a coordinate system where A is at (0,0). Then B is at (x,0) for some x>0. We know that $\angle BAC = 49^\circ$ and $\angle ABC = 39^\circ$. Also, $\angle ACB = 92^\circ$. Let C be at $(r \cos \theta, r \sin \theta)$. Since point A is west of point B. $x=d\cos\theta$ and $y = d\sin\theta$.
Then since $\angle C = 92^\circ$. we know what $x$ and $y$ will be at the origin.
We want to find the bearing of A from C.

Consider the vertical line at point C. The angle between this line and the line to A is what we want.
Since B is East of A, AB is horizontal.
The angle $\angle ACB=92^\circ$. Draw a line going North from C. We want to find the angle between the North line and CA. Since $\angle CAB=49^\circ$ and $\angle CBA=39^\circ$ and North is straight up.

$360 - x$. This gives 238.
Final Answer: $238^\circ$
