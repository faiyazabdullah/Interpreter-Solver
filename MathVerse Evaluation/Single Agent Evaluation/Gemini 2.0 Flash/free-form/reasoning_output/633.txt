QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of $y=\sin x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(90^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=5 \sin x$

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The function $y=5 \sin x$ is a vertical stretch of the function $y=\sin x$ by a factor of $5$. The first maximum point of $y = \sin x$ for $x \geq 0$ is at $(90^{\circ}, 1)$.

Since the transformation is a vertical stretch by a factor of $5$, the x-coordinate of the first maximum point remains the same, but the y-coordinate is multiplied by $5$. Thus, the first maximum point of $y = 5 \sin x$ is at $(90^{\circ}, 5(1))$, which is $(90^{\circ}, 5)$.

Final Answer: $(90^\circ, 5)$
