Let $x$ be the length of each of the seven marked edges. From the given figure, we have $x = 7$ cm. The height of the prism is given as 16 cm.
The composite solid can be seen as the union of three rectangular prisms.
The bottom prism has dimensions $3x \times x \times 16$ cm, where $x = 7$ cm. Thus, the dimensions are $3(7) \times 7 \times 16 = 21 \times 7 \times 16$ cm. The volume of this prism is $21 \times 7 \times 16 = 2352 \text{ cm}^3$.

The top two prisms are identical. Each prism has dimensions $x \times x \times 16$ cm, where $x = 7$ cm. Thus, the dimensions are $7 \times 7 \times 16$ cm. The volume of each prism is $7 \times 7 \times 16 = 784 \text{ cm}^3$. Since there are two of these prisms, their total volume is $2 \times 784 = 1568 \text{ cm}^3$.

The total volume of the composite solid is the sum of the volumes of the three prisms:
$2352 + 1568 = 3920 \text{ cm}^3$.

Final Answer: $\text{Volume} = 3920 \text{ cm}^3$
Final Answer: $3920 \text{ cm}^3$
