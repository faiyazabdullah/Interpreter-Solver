QUESTION:
The following is a right pyramid on a square base with side length 16cm. A right pyramid has its apex aligned directly above the centre of its base.

The edge length VA is 26cm.
Find the length of VW, the perpendicular height of the pyramid correct to two decimal places.

Let the square base be $ABCD$, and let the apex of the pyramid be $V$. Let $W$ be the center of the square base. Then $VW$ is perpendicular to the base.
Since the base is a square with side length 16 cm, the length of the diagonal $AC$ is $16\sqrt{2}$ cm. Then the distance from a vertex to the center of the square is half the length of the diagonal, so $AW = \frac{16\sqrt{2}}{2} = 8\sqrt{2}$ cm.
We are given that $VA = 26$ cm. Since $VW$ is perpendicular to the base, triangle $VAW$ is a right triangle with right angle at $W$. Thus, by the Pythagorean theorem, we have $VA^2 = VW^2 + AW^2$.
Substituting the given values, we have $26^2 = VW^2 + (8\sqrt{2})^2$.
$676 = VW^2 + (64 \cdot 2)$
$676 = VW^2 + 128$
$VW^2 = 676 - 128 = 548$
$VW = \sqrt{548} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 137} = 2\sqrt{137} \approx 23.4094$
Rounding to two decimal places, we have $VW \approx 23.41$ cm.

Final Answer: $23.41$
