QUESTION:
This box is to have a divider placed in as shown. The box has sides of length 9cm, 9cm and 19cm.
Calculate the area of the divider correct to two decimal places, using your rounded answer from the previous part.

The divider is a rectangle. One side of the rectangle is given as 9 cm. The other side is the length of the diagonal of the base of the box, which has sides 19 cm and 9 cm.
Let the length of the diagonal be $d$.
By the Pythagorean theorem, $d^2 = 19^2 + 9^2 = 361 + 81 = 442$.
So, $d = \sqrt{442} \approx 21.0238$.

The area of the divider is the area of the rectangle, which is $9 \times d = 9 \times \sqrt{442}$.
Area $= 9 \times \sqrt{442} \approx 9 \times 21.0238 = 189.2142$.
The question states to use the rounded answer from the previous part, which we assume to be the value of $d$, rounded to two decimal places. So, let us use $d = 21.02$.
Then the area of the divider is $9 \times 21.02 = 189.18$.

The area of the divider is $9 \times \sqrt{442} \approx 189.21$.

Final Answer: $189.18 \text{ cm}^2$
