GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The image shows a triangular prism. The base is a right triangle with legs of length 2 cm and 4 cm. The height of the prism is 8 cm. The volume of a triangular prism is given by the formula $V = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \times H$, where $b$ and $h$ are the base and height of the right triangle, and $H$ is the height of the prism. In this case, $b = 4$ cm, $h = 2$ cm, and $H = 8$ cm.

Therefore, the volume of the triangular prism is $V = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 2 \times 8 = \frac{1}{2} \times 64 = 32 \text{ cm}^3$.

Final Answer: $32 \text{ cm}^3$
