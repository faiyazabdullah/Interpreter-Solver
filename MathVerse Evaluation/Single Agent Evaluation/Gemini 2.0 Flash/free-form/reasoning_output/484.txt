QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2). The point at (-5,2) and (3,2) are respectively solid and hollow. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graph is a parabola. The domain is the set of all possible $x$ values, and the range is the set of all possible $y$ values. The graph starts at $x = -5$, which is included, and ends at $x = 3$, which is not included. The minimum $y$ value is $0$, and the maximum $y$ value is $2$.
Therefore, the domain is $[-5, 3)$.
The $y$ values range from 0 to 2. The $y$ value is 0 at $x = -1$, and at $x=-5$ and $x=3$ the $y$ value is 2.
Since the solid point at $x=-5$ means it's included, but the hollow point at $x=3$ means it's not included, the range is $[0, 2]$.

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } [-5, 3), \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]$
