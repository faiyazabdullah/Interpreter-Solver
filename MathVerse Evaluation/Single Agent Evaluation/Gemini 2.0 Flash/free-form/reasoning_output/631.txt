QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=-5\sin x

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given function is $y = -5\sin x$. The original sine function, $y = \sin x$, has its first maximum at $(90^\circ, 1)$.

The transformation $y = -5\sin x$ involves two transformations: a vertical stretch by a factor of 5, and a reflection across the x-axis. The vertical stretch by a factor of 5 changes the maximum value from 1 to 5, so the point $(90^\circ, 1)$ becomes $(90^\circ, 5)$.
The reflection across the x-axis changes the sign of the y-coordinate, so $(90^\circ, 5)$ becomes $(90^\circ, -5)$.

However, the problem asks for the coordinates of the first maximum point of $y = -5\sin x$ for $x \ge 0$. Since the function is $y = -5\sin x$, it's a sine function reflected across the x-axis and vertically stretched by a factor of 5. Therefore, the maximum of the original sine function becomes a minimum in the transformed function. The first minimum is at $90^\circ$, and the value is $-5$. The next maximum will occur after the next minimum. The graph of $y = -5\sin x$ will have a maximum at $x = 270^\circ$, since at that point the original sine function has a minimum value of -1, so $-5\sin(270^\circ) = -5(-1) = 5$. Therefore, the first maximum is at $(270^\circ, 5)$.

Final Answer: $(270^\circ, 5)$
