QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\sin a$.

The problem states that the terminal side of angle $a$ intersects the circle at point $P(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5})$. Since the circle has a radius of 1 and its center is at the origin, we have a unit circle.
The coordinates of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle are given by $(\cos a, \sin a)$.
We are given that the point is $P(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5})$. Therefore, we can equate the coordinates to the cosine and sine of angle $a$:
$\cos a = \frac{3}{5}$
$\sin a = \frac{4}{5}$

We are asked to find the value of $\sin a$. From the information above, we know that $\sin a = \frac{4}{5}$.

Final Answer: $\frac{4}{5}$
