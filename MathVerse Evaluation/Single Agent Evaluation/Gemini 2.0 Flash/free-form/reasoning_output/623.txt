QUESTION:
Two piecewirse function $g$ and $f$ are graphed, $g$ is graphed in purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), $f$ is graphed in blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). t is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport.
The airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon.
What is the other time the airplanes have the same height?
Round your answer to the nearest ten minutes.
About _ minutes after noon

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The graphs of the two piecewise functions intersect at two points. One intersection is given as about 9 minutes after noon. We are asked to find the other time the airplanes have the same height.
From the graph, the first intersection is between 0 and 20 minutes. The second intersection is between 90 and 110 minutes. The function $g(t)$ is decreasing from $t=0$ to $t=40$ and constant from $t=40$ to $t=80$, then increasing from $t=80$ to $t=100$, and constant again from $t=100$ onwards.
The function $f(t)$ is constant from $t=10$ to $t=50$, then decreasing from $t=50$ to $t=60$, constant from $t=60$ to $t=100$, and decreasing from $t=100$ to $t=120$.
Between $t=80$ and $t=100$, $g(t)$ increases and $f(t)$ is constant at 10000.
The other intersection point is between $t=90$ and $t=110$. From the graph, the intersection occurs near $t=100$ minutes. The $f(t)$ and $g(t)$ values are the same near $t=100$ minutes.
Since we need to round the answer to the nearest ten minutes, the other time the airplanes have the same height is approximately 100 minutes after noon.

Final Answer: $100$
