QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 60°, the marked right angled side has a length of 11, and the diagonal side has a length of w. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown w.

The problem describes a right-angled triangle with a given angle of 60° and the length of the side opposite to the angle being 11. We are asked to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is denoted by $w$.

We can use the trigonometric function sine to relate the opposite side and the hypotenuse:

$\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$

In our case, $\theta = 60^\circ$, the opposite side is 11, and the hypotenuse is $w$. So, we have:

$\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{11}{w}$

We know that $\sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$. Substituting this into the equation:

$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{11}{w}$

To solve for $w$, we can cross-multiply:

$w \sqrt{3} = 22$

$w = \frac{22}{\sqrt{3}}$

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $\sqrt{3}$:

$w = \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3}$

Therefore, the value of $w$ is $\frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3}$.

Final Answer: $\frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3}$
