QUESTION:
Iainâ€™s car has run out of petrol. He walks 12 km west and then 9 km south looking for a petrol station.

If he is now $h$ km directly from his starting point, find the value of $h$.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The problem describes a right triangle with legs of length 12 km and 9 km. The value $h$ is the length of the hypotenuse. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $h$. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. In this case, $a = 12$ km and $b = 9$ km, and we want to find $h = c$.
So we have $12^2 + 9^2 = h^2$.
$12^2 = 144$ and $9^2 = 81$.
Thus, $144 + 81 = h^2$, which means $h^2 = 225$.
Taking the square root of both sides, we get $h = \sqrt{225} = 15$.
The distance $h$ is 15 km.

Final Answer: $15$
