The shape consists of two identical boxes with a cylinder connecting them. The dimensions of the box are 25, 20, and 33. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11. We need to find the surface area of the entire solid.

First, let's find the surface area of one box. The surface area of a box is given by $2(lw + lh + wh)$, where $l$, $w$, and $h$ are the length, width, and height of the box, respectively. In this case, $l = 25$, $w = 20$, and $h = 33$.
Surface Area of one box = $2(25 \cdot 20 + 25 \cdot 33 + 20 \cdot 33) = 2(500 + 825 + 660) = 2(1985) = 3970$.

Since there are two boxes, the total surface area of the two boxes is $2 \times 3970 = 7940$.

However, there is a cylindrical hole cut in each box, so we need to subtract the area of the two circles from the boxes. The radius of the cylinder is 6, so the area of one circle is $\pi r^2 = \pi (6^2) = 36\pi$. Since there are two circles (one on each box), the area to subtract is $2 \times 36\pi = 72\pi$.

Next, we need to add the lateral surface area of the cylinder. The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by $2\pi r h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. In this case, $r = 6$ and $h = 11$.
Lateral Surface Area of the cylinder = $2\pi (6)(11) = 132\pi$.

So, the total surface area of the solid is:
(Surface area of two boxes) - (Area of two circles) + (Lateral surface area of the cylinder)
$7940 - 72\pi + 132\pi = 7940 + 60\pi$

Now, we need to approximate the value of $60\pi$.
$60\pi \approx 60 \times 3.14159 = 188.4954$

Total Surface Area $\approx 7940 + 188.4954 = 8128.4954$

Rounding to two decimal places, we get $8128.50$.

Final Answer: $8128.50$

The total surface area of the solid is $7940 - 72\pi + 132\pi = 7940 + 60\pi \approx 7940 + 60(3.14159) = 7940 + 188.4954 \approx 8128.50$.

Final Answer: $8128.50$
Final Answer: $7940 + 60\pi$

Now, let's compute the numerical value.
$7940 + 60\pi \approx 7940 + 60(3.1415926535) \approx 7940 + 188.495559215 \approx 8128.495559215$

Rounding to two decimal places: $8128.50$.

Final Answer: $8128.50$
Final Answer: $8128.50$
