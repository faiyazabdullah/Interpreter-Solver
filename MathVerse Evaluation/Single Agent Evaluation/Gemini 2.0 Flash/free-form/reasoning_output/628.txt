QUESTION:
Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

If the graph is translated 10 units up, what will be the coordinates of the new $y$-intercept?

State the coordinates in the form $(a, b)$.

The equation of the given linear function is $y = 4 - x$.
The $y$-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the $y$-axis, which is the point where $x = 0$.
Substituting $x = 0$ into the equation, we get $y = 4 - 0 = 4$.
So the $y$-intercept is $(0, 4)$.

If the graph is translated 10 units up, the new equation will be $y = 4 - x + 10$, which simplifies to $y = 14 - x$.
To find the new $y$-intercept, we set $x = 0$ in the new equation: $y = 14 - 0 = 14$.
So the new $y$-intercept is $(0, 14)$.

Final Answer: $(0, 14)$
