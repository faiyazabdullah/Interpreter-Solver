QUESTION:
The graph shows the amount of water remaining in a bucket that was initially full before a hole was made in its side. What is the slope of the shown function that passes (0, 30)?

The graph shows a linear function representing the amount of water remaining in a bucket over time. The initial amount of water is 30 litres when time is 0 minutes. We need to find the slope of this function.

The line passes through (0, 30). We need another point on the line to calculate the slope.
From the graph, it also passes through (40, 8).
The slope of a line passing through points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:
$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$

Using the points (0, 30) and (40, 8), the slope is:
$m = \frac{8 - 30}{40 - 0} = \frac{-22}{40} = -\frac{11}{20} = -0.55$

The slope of the shown function is -0.55.

Final Answer: $-\frac{11}{20}$
