QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with double arrows intersects with y-axis at -4 and 4. Its asymptote in dashed orange is $y=(4/5)x$ and $y=-(4/5)x$. There is also a green rectangular tangent to the hyperbola. Find the equation of the hyperbola.

The given hyperbola intersects the y-axis at $y = -4$ and $y = 4$. This implies that the hyperbola is centered at the origin $(0,0)$. Also, the vertices of the hyperbola are at $(0, 4)$ and $(0, -4)$, which means $a = 4$.
The asymptotes are given by $y = \frac{4}{5}x$ and $y = -\frac{4}{5}x$.
Since the hyperbola opens along the y-axis, the standard equation of the hyperbola is of the form $\frac{y^2}{a^2} - \frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1$.
The asymptotes of such a hyperbola are given by $y = \pm \frac{a}{b}x$.
We are given that the asymptotes are $y = \pm \frac{4}{5}x$.
Therefore, $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{4}{5}$. Since $a = 4$, we have $\frac{4}{b} = \frac{4}{5}$. This implies that $b = 5$.
Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is $\frac{y^2}{4^2} - \frac{x^2}{5^2} = 1$, which simplifies to $\frac{y^2}{16} - \frac{x^2}{25} = 1$.

Final Answer: $\frac{y^2}{16} - \frac{x^2}{25} = 1$
