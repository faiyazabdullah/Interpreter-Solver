QUESTION:
The volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere is given by the formula:

V=\frac{1}{4}\pi h\left(4r^2-h^2\right)

where r is the radius of the sphere and h is the height of the cylinder.

What is the radius of the sphere if the volume of the cylinder is 13.75\pi cm3 and the height of the cylinder is 5 cm?

We are given the volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere as $V = \frac{1}{4}\pi h(4r^2 - h^2)$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the volume of the cylinder is $13.75\pi \text{ cm}^3$ and the height of the cylinder is $5 \text{ cm}$. We need to find the radius of the sphere, $r$.

We can substitute the given values into the formula:
$13.75\pi = \frac{1}{4}\pi (5)(4r^2 - 5^2)$
$13.75\pi = \frac{5}{4}\pi (4r^2 - 25)$

We can divide both sides by $\pi$:
$13.75 = \frac{5}{4}(4r^2 - 25)$

Now, multiply both sides by $\frac{4}{5}$:
$\frac{4}{5} \times 13.75 = 4r^2 - 25$
$\frac{4 \times 13.75}{5} = 4r^2 - 25$
$\frac{55}{5} = 4r^2 - 25$
$11 = 4r^2 - 25$

Add 25 to both sides:
$11 + 25 = 4r^2$
$36 = 4r^2$

Divide by 4:
$r^2 = \frac{36}{4}$
$r^2 = 9$

Take the square root of both sides:
$r = \sqrt{9}$
$r = 3$

Therefore, the radius of the sphere is $3 \text{ cm}$.

Final Answer: $3$
