Let's analyze the given geometric figure. It appears to be a prism with a trapezoidal base. The dimensions of the trapezoid are: two parallel sides of lengths 9 cm and 12 cm, and a height of 3 cm. One of the non-parallel sides is given as 5 cm. The other non-parallel side can be found using Pythagorean theorem on the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from the endpoint of the 9cm side to the 12cm side. The base of the triangle is 12cm - 9cm = 3cm, and the height is 3cm, so the length of the slanted side is $\sqrt{3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}$ cm. The prism has two trapezoidal bases, two rectangular sides with lengths 5cm x 12cm and 5cm x 9cm, and two slanted rectangle sides with lengths 5cm x $3\sqrt{2}$ cm.

The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula: $\frac{1}{2}(b_1 + b_2)h$, where $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the parallel sides, and $h$ is the height. In this case, $b_1 = 9$ cm, $b_2 = 12$ cm, and $h = 3$ cm. So, the area of one trapezoid is $\frac{1}{2}(9 + 12)(3) = \frac{1}{2}(21)(3) = \frac{63}{2} = 31.5 \text{cm}^2$. Since there are two trapezoidal bases, their total area is $2 \times 31.5 = 63 \text{cm}^2$.

The area of the rectangle with sides 5 cm and 12 cm is $5 \times 12 = 60 \text{cm}^2$. The area of the rectangle with sides 5 cm and 9 cm is $5 \times 9 = 45 \text{cm}^2$.
The area of the slanted rectangle side is $5 \times 3\sqrt{2} = 15\sqrt{2} \text{cm}^2$.  Since there are two slanted rectangle sides, their total area is $2 \times 15\sqrt{2} = 30\sqrt{2} \text{cm}^2$.

The total surface area of the prism is the sum of the areas of all its faces:
$63 + 60 + 45 + 30\sqrt{2} = 168 + 30\sqrt{2} \approx 168 + 30(1.4142) = 168 + 42.426 = 210.426 \text{cm}^2$.
Rounding to two decimal places, we get $210.43 \text{cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $168 + 30\sqrt{2}$
Final Answer: $210.43$
Final Answer: $\text{Surface Area} = 210.43 \text{cm}^2$
