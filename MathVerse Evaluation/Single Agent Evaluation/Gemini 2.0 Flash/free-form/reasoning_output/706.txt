The figure is a triangular prism. The base is an isosceles triangle with base 12 cm and two equal sides of 10 cm each. The height of the prism is 16 cm.
We need to find the total surface area of the triangular prism.
The surface area of the prism is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the three rectangular sides.

First, find the height of the isosceles triangle. Let the height be $x$. Since the height bisects the base, we have a right triangle with hypotenuse 10 and one leg 6. Then $x^2 + 6^2 = 10^2$, so $x^2 + 36 = 100$, and $x^2 = 64$, so $x = 8$.
The area of the triangular base is $\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 8 = 48 \text{cm}^2$.
Since there are two such triangles, their combined area is $2 \times 48 = 96 \text{cm}^2$.

The three rectangular sides are two rectangles with sides 10 cm and 16 cm, and one rectangle with sides 12 cm and 16 cm.
The area of each of the rectangles with sides 10 cm and 16 cm is $10 \times 16 = 160 \text{cm}^2$. The combined area of these two rectangles is $2 \times 160 = 320 \text{cm}^2$.
The area of the rectangle with sides 12 cm and 16 cm is $12 \times 16 = 192 \text{cm}^2$.

The total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two triangles and the three rectangles:
$96 + 320 + 192 = 608 \text{cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $608 \text{ cm}^2$
