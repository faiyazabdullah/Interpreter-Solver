QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is -6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The x-intercept is -3, and the y-intercept is -6. Therefore, the line passes through the points $(-3, 0)$ and $(0, -6)$.
The slope of the line is $m = \frac{-6 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{-6}{3} = -2$.
The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m = -2$ and $b = -6$.
So, the equation of the line is $y = -2x - 6$.

Since the region is shaded above the line, the inequality is of the form $y \geq -2x - 6$ or $y > -2x - 6$.
To determine whether it is $\geq$ or $>$, we check if the line is solid or dashed.
In the given image, the line is solid, which means the inequality is inclusive.
So, the inequality is $y \geq -2x - 6$.

Rearranging the inequality, we get $y + 2x \geq -6$, or $2x + y \geq -6$.

Final Answer: $2x + y \geq -6$
