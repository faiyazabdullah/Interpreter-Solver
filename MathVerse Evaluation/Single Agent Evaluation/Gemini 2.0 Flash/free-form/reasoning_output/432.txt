Let the two endpoints be $A = (-3, 4)$ and $B = (5, 2)$. We want to find the distance between these two points.
The distance formula is given by $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points.
In this case, $(x_1, y_1) = (-3, 4)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (5, 2)$.
Plugging in the values, we get:
$d = \sqrt{(5 - (-3))^2 + (2 - 4)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{(5 + 3)^2 + (-2)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{8^2 + (-2)^2}$
$d = \sqrt{64 + 4}$
$d = \sqrt{68}$
Now we need to approximate the square root of 68.
Since $8^2 = 64$ and $9^2 = 81$, we know that $\sqrt{68}$ is between 8 and 9.
We can write $\sqrt{68} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 17} = 2\sqrt{17}$.
We can approximate $\sqrt{17}$ as follows: $4^2 = 16$ and $5^2 = 25$, so $\sqrt{17}$ is between 4 and 5.
Let's try 4.1: $4.1^2 = 16.81$.
Let's try 4.12: $4.12^2 = 16.9744$.
Let's try 4.123: $4.123^2 = 16.998929$.
Let's try 4.1231: $4.1231^2 = 17.00033561$.
So $\sqrt{17} \approx 4.123$.
Therefore, $d = 2\sqrt{17} \approx 2(4.123) = 8.246$.
We have $d = \sqrt{68}$. To find the approximate value, we can use a calculator:
$\sqrt{68} \approx 8.24621125124$
Rounding to three decimal places, we get $d \approx 8.246$.

Final Answer: $8.246$
