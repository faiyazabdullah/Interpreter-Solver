QUESTION:
There is a quadratic function that opens upwards symmetric with respect to x=2. The vertex of the parabola is at the point (2,-2). Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given quadratic function opens upwards and is symmetric with respect to the vertical line $x=2$. The vertex of the parabola is at the point $(2, -2)$.
Since the parabola opens upwards, the function is decreasing to the left of the vertex and increasing to the right of the vertex.
The function is decreasing on the interval $(-\infty, 2)$ and increasing on the interval $(2, \infty)$.
Since the parabola is opening upwards, it never remains constant.

Final Answer: $\text{Decreasing: } (-\infty, 2), \quad \text{Increasing: } (2, \infty)$
