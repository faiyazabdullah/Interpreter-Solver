QUESTION:
A cylinder with a radius of 2.5cm and a height of 10cm contains two identical spherical balls that fit exactly inside it. What is the surface area of each ball? Give your answer correct to one decimal place.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The cylinder has a height of 10 cm and a diameter of 2.5 cm, so its radius is 1.25 cm.
Since the two spherical balls fit exactly inside the cylinder, they must be touching each other, and the diameter of each sphere must be half the height of the cylinder. Therefore, the diameter of each sphere is $10 \text{cm} / 2 = 5 \text{cm}$.
The radius of each sphere is half of the diameter, so the radius $r$ of each sphere is $5 \text{cm} / 2 = 2.5 \text{cm}$.

The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula $A = 4 \pi r^2$, where $r$ is the radius of the sphere.
In this case, $r = 2.5 \text{cm}$, so the surface area of each sphere is $A = 4 \pi (2.5 \text{cm})^2 = 4 \pi (6.25) \text{cm}^2 = 25 \pi \text{cm}^2$.
$25\pi \approx 25 \times 3.14159265359 = 78.5398163397$.
Rounding to one decimal place, we have $78.5 \text{cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $78.5 \text{cm}^2$
