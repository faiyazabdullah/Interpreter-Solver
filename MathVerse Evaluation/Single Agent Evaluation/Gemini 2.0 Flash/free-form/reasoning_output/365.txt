QUESTION:
The airtraffic controller is communicating with a plane in flight approaching an airport for landing. The plane is 10369 metres above the ground and is still 23444 metres from the runway. If \theta Â° is the angle at which the plane should approach, find \theta  to one decimal place.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The problem describes a right triangle where the plane's height above the ground is the opposite side, the distance from the plane to the runway is the adjacent side, and $\theta$ is the angle of approach. We are given the lengths of the opposite side (10369 m) and the adjacent side (23444 m). We can use the tangent function to find the angle $\theta$.

$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{10369}{23444}$

To find $\theta$, we take the arctangent (inverse tangent) of the ratio:

$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{10369}{23444}\right)$

Now, we calculate the value of $\theta$ in degrees:

$\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{10369}{23444}\right) \approx 23.883^\circ$

We are asked to round the answer to one decimal place, so

$\theta \approx 23.9^\circ$

Final Answer: $23.9^\circ$
