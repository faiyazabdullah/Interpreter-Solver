QUESTION:
The final approach of an aeroplane when landing requires the pilot to adjust their angle of descent to about 3Â°. If the plane is 12 metres above the runway and has d metres until touchdown, find d to the nearest metre.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the angle of descent be $\theta = 3^\circ$. Let the height of the plane above the runway be $h = 12 \text{ m}$. Let the distance until touchdown be $d \text{ m}$. We are given a right triangle with the angle of descent $\theta$, the opposite side $h$, and the adjacent side $d$.

We can use the tangent function to relate the angle, the height, and the distance:
$\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{h}{d}$
In this case, $\tan(3^\circ) = \frac{12}{d}$
To find $d$, we can rearrange the equation:
$d = \frac{12}{\tan(3^\circ)}$
Using a calculator, we find that $\tan(3^\circ) \approx 0.052407779$
$d = \frac{12}{0.052407779} \approx 228.9659$
Since we need to round to the nearest metre, we have $d \approx 229 \text{ m}$.

Final Answer: $229 \text{ m}$
Final Answer: $229$
