QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the south direction is 32Â°.

What is the true bearing of A from O?

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The true bearing of a point is the angle measured clockwise from North.
The angle between line OA and the South direction is $32^\circ$.
Since the angle between North and South is $180^\circ$, the angle between North and the line OA is $180^\circ + 32^\circ = 212^\circ$.
Therefore, the true bearing of A from O is $180^\circ + 32^\circ = 212^\circ$.

Final Answer: $212^\circ$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $212^\circ$
