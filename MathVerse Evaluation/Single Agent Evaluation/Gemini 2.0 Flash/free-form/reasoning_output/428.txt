QUESTION:
The logo of a shop consists of five semicircles; four small semicircles each with the same radius, and one large semicircle. The perimeter of the whole shape is 14\pi  units.
The entire shape is to be enlarged by a factor of 5 to form a logo sticker on the window of a shop front. What area of the shop front window will the sticker take up?

Let the radius of each of the four small semicircles be $r$. Then the radius of the large semicircle is $2r$.
The perimeter of a semicircle is $\pi \times \text{radius}$.
The perimeter of the whole shape is the sum of the lengths of the arcs of the five semicircles.
The lengths of the arcs are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4 small semicircles: $4 \times \pi r = 4\pi r$
    \item 1 large semicircle: $\pi (2r) = 2\pi r$
\end{itemize}
The total perimeter is $4\pi r + 2\pi r = 6\pi r$.
Given that the perimeter of the whole shape is $14\pi$ units, we have $6\pi r = 14\pi$.
Dividing both sides by $6\pi$, we get $r = \frac{14\pi}{6\pi} = \frac{14}{6} = \frac{7}{3}$.
The radius of the small semicircles is $\frac{7}{3}$ units, and the radius of the large semicircle is $2r = 2 \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{14}{3}$ units.

The area of the whole shape is the area of the large semicircle minus the area of the two semicircles that are "cut out", plus the area of the two semicircles that are sticking out.  Since the "cut out" semicircles and the sticking out semicircles are all of the same size, these areas cancel out.  Therefore, the area of the shape is the same as the area of the large semicircle.
The area of the large semicircle is $\frac{1}{2} \pi (\frac{14}{3})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{196}{9} = \frac{98\pi}{9}$ square units.

The shape is enlarged by a factor of 5. This means that the linear dimensions are multiplied by 5. The new radius of the small semicircles is $5r = 5 \times \frac{7}{3} = \frac{35}{3}$ and the new radius of the large semicircle is $5 \times \frac{14}{3} = \frac{70}{3}$.
The area of the enlarged shape is the area of the large semicircle with radius $\frac{70}{3}$, which is
$\frac{1}{2} \pi (\frac{70}{3})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{4900}{9} = \frac{2450\pi}{9}$.

Another way to calculate the area of the enlarged shape is to use the fact that if the linear dimensions are multiplied by a factor of $k$, the area is multiplied by a factor of $k^2$. In this case, $k=5$, so the area is multiplied by $5^2 = 25$. The original area was $\frac{98\pi}{9}$, so the new area is $25 \times \frac{98\pi}{9} = \frac{2450\pi}{9}$.

$\text{Area} = \frac{2450\pi}{9} \approx 855.28$

Final Answer: $\frac{2450\pi}{9}$
