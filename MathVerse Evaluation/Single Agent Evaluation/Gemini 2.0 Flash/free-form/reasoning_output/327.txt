QUESTION:
During a rescue search, a helicopter flew b kilometres west from point X to point Y, then changed course and flew 10.7 kilometres north to point Z. If point Z is on a bearing of 335Â° T from point X:

Now, if the distance that the helicopter must fly between point Z and point X is d kilometres, calculate d to one decimal place.

The problem describes a right triangle $XYZ$ where the helicopter flies from point $X$ west to point $Y$, then north to point $Z$. The bearing of $Z$ from $X$ is $335^\circ$. This means that the angle between the north direction and the line $XZ$ is $360^\circ - 335^\circ = 25^\circ$. This angle is also the angle $ZXY$. We are given that $YZ = 10.7$ km. We need to find the distance $XZ$, which is $d$.

Since $XYZ$ is a right triangle, we have $\tan(25^\circ) = \frac{XY}{YZ}$. We are also given that $YZ = 10.7$ km.
Therefore, $XY = YZ \tan(25^\circ) = 10.7 \tan(25^\circ)$.
Also, we have $XZ^2 = XY^2 + YZ^2$ (Pythagorean theorem).
So, $d^2 = (10.7 \tan(25^\circ))^2 + (10.7)^2$.
$d^2 = (10.7)^2 (\tan^2(25^\circ) + 1) = (10.7)^2 \sec^2(25^\circ)$.
$d = 10.7 \sec(25^\circ)$.
Since $\sec(25^\circ) = \frac{1}{\cos(25^\circ)}$, we have $d = \frac{10.7}{\cos(25^\circ)}$.
We have $\cos(25^\circ) \approx 0.9063$.
$d \approx \frac{10.7}{0.9063} \approx 11.806$.
Therefore, $d \approx 11.8$ km.

Final Answer: $11.8$
