QUESTION:
This box is to have a divider placed in as shown. The box has sides of length 19 cm, 10 cm and 7 cm.
Calculate the area of the divider correct to two decimal places, using your rounded answer from the previous part.

The divider forms a rectangle. One side of the rectangle is the height of the box, which is $7 \text{ cm}$. The other side is the diagonal of the base, which has sides of length $19 \text{ cm}$ and $10 \text{ cm}$.

We can calculate the length of the diagonal of the base using the Pythagorean theorem. Let $d$ be the length of the diagonal. Then
$$d^2 = 19^2 + 10^2 = 361 + 100 = 461$$
$$d = \sqrt{461} \approx 21.4709$$
The area of the divider is the area of the rectangle with sides $7 \text{ cm}$ and $\sqrt{461} \text{ cm}$. Thus, the area is
$$A = 7 \sqrt{461} \approx 7 \times 21.4709 \approx 150.2963 \text{ cm}^2$$
Rounding to two decimal places, we get $150.30 \text{ cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $150.30 \text{ cm}^2$
