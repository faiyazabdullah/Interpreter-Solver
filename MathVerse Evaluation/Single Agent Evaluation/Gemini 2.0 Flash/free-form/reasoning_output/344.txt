QUESTION:
At a point during the flight, a plane is 42 kilometres south and 57 kilometres west of the airport it left from.


Find the size of the angle marked b to one decimal place.

The problem gives us the south and west distances of a plane from an airport. We are asked to find the angle $b$ shown in the figure.

From the figure, we see a right triangle where the distance south is 42 km and the distance west is 57 km. We are given that $b$ is the angle between the north direction and the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the plane's position relative to the airport. Let's call the angle between the south direction and the hypotenuse $\theta$. Then $b = 90^\circ - \theta$.

In the right triangle, the side adjacent to the angle $\theta$ is 42 km and the side opposite to the angle $\theta$ is 57 km. We can use the tangent function to find $\theta$:
$$ \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{57}{42} $$
$$ \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{57}{42}\right) $$
Using a calculator:
$$ \theta \approx 53.60278 \dots ^\circ $$
Now, we find $b$:
$$ b = 90^\circ - \theta $$
$$ b = 90^\circ - 53.60278^\circ $$
$$ b \approx 36.39722^\circ $$
Rounding to one decimal place, we get:
$$ b \approx 36.4^\circ $$

Final Answer: $36.4^\circ$
