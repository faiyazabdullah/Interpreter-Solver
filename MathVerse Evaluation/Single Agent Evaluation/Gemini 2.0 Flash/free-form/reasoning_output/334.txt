QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the positive direction of the x-axis is 28Â°.

Find the true bearing of A from O.

The true bearing of a point is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction to the line joining the point to the origin.

In the given diagram, the angle between the line OA and the positive direction of the x-axis (east) is $28^\circ$.
The angle between the positive y-axis (north) and the positive x-axis (east) is $90^\circ$.

Therefore, the angle between the north direction and the line OA is $90^\circ + 28^\circ = 118^\circ$.
So, the true bearing of A from O is $118^\circ$.

Final Answer: $118^\circ$
