QUESTION:
Consider the following cube with a side length equal to 6 cm. The nine marked edges have the same length. Find the total surface area.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The given cube has side length 6 cm. A cube has 6 faces, each of which is a square. The area of each square face is side length squared. Thus, the area of one face of the cube is $6^2 = 36 \text{ cm}^2$. Since there are 6 faces, the total surface area of the cube is $6 \times 36 = 216 \text{ cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $216 \text{ cm}^2$
Final Answer: $216 \text{ cm}^2$
