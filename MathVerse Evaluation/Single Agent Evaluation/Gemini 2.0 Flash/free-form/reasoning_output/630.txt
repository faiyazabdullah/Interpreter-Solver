QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of y=\sin x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(90^\circ ,1\right).

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=5\sin x

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The function $y = \sin x$ has its first maximum point for $x \ge 0$ at $(90^\circ, 1)$. We want to find the coordinates of the first maximum point of $y = 5 \sin x$.

The transformation from $y = \sin x$ to $y = 5 \sin x$ is a vertical stretch by a factor of 5. This means that the $y$-coordinate of the maximum point will be multiplied by 5, while the $x$-coordinate will remain the same.

So, the first maximum point of $y = 5 \sin x$ will be at $(90^\circ, 5 \cdot 1) = (90^\circ, 5)$.

Final Answer: $(90^\circ, 5)$
