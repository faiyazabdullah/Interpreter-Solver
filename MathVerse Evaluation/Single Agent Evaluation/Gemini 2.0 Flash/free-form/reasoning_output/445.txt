QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\sin a$.

The problem states that the terminal side of angle $a$ intersects the circle at the point $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The circle has its center at the origin and a radius of 1. We want to find the value of $\sin a$.

Since the radius of the circle is 1, we can directly relate the coordinates of the point $P$ to the trigonometric functions of the angle $a$. We know that for a point $(x, y)$ on the unit circle, $x = \cos a$ and $y = \sin a$.

In this case, the point $P$ is $\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$, so we have $x = -\frac{21}{29}$ and $y = \frac{20}{29}$. Therefore, $\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}$ and $\sin a = \frac{20}{29}$.

The problem asks for the value of $\sin a$, which is the $y$-coordinate of the point $P$. Thus, $\sin a = \frac{20}{29}$.

Final Answer: $\frac{20}{29}$
