QUESTION:
The perimeter is equal to the sum of the four side lengths of the trapezium. Find the length of the missing side of the trapezium shown.

Let the trapezium be $ABCD$, where $AB$ is the base, $CD$ is the top and $AD$ is the side. We are given that $AD = 10 \text{ cm}$ and the height of the trapezium is $6 \text{ cm}$. Since the opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent, $AB = CD$. The height of the parallelogram is given as $6$ cm. The area of the parallelogram is given by the base times the height. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all sides. In this case, the parallelogram has two sides of length 10 cm. We need to find the length of the side of the parallelogram, which is not labeled.
Let the unknown side length be $x$. Since it is a parallelogram, opposite sides are of equal length.
The perimeter of a parallelogram is given by $2(a+b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are the side lengths. In our case, one of the side lengths is 10 cm. The other side length is the base of the dotted right triangle which is unknown, call it $x$. We are given the height of the parallelogram which is also the side length of the dotted right triangle.
Let the other side be x cm. Then the perimeter of the parallelogram is $2(10+x)$.
From the diagram, we can observe that the length of one side is 10 cm and the height is 6 cm. The formula for the area of a parallelogram is $A = b \times h$ where b is the base and h is the height. We want to find the length of the missing side of the trapezium, say $x$. We see the trapezium has sides 10 cm, x cm, 10 cm and x cm.
However, the question asks us to find the length of the missing side of the trapezium shown. From the diagram, we can see that the height is 6cm and one side is 10cm. Also, this is a parallelogram, so there are two sides with 10cm. Let the other side be denoted by $x$. We need to find $x$. Let's re-examine the question and diagram again.

The figure is a parallelogram with a height of 6 cm, and one side of length 10 cm. Let's assume we are asked to find the area of the parallelogram. The area is given by $A = b \times h$, where the base is $x$. If we knew the length of the base, we could find the area.

Since we are asked to find the length of the missing side, and we have a parallelogram with a height of 6 cm and one side of 10 cm.
However, there is no mention of the perimeter in the question. Also, we don't know what the other dimensions are, we are only given a side 10cm and a height 6 cm. So, we cannot find the perimeter.
Let us say the base of the parallelogram is $x$. Let the acute angle be $\theta$.
Then $\sin \theta = \frac{6}{10} = \frac{3}{5}$.
Then $\theta = \sin^{-1} \frac{3}{5}$.

Final Answer: $6$
