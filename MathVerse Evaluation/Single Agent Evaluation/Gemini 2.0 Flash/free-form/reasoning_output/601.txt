GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The line passes through the points (2, -1), (5, 1), (8, 3), and (11, 5).
We need to find the equation of the line in point-slope form.
The point-slope form of a line is given by $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line.

First, we need to find the slope of the line. We can use any two points to calculate the slope. Let's use the points (2, -1) and (5, 1).
$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{1 - (-1)}{5 - 2} = \frac{1 + 1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$

Now that we have the slope, $m = \frac{2}{3}$, we can use any point on the line to write the equation in point-slope form. Let's use the point (2, -1).
$y - (-1) = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$
$y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$

Alternatively, we can use the point (5, 1):
$y - 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 5)$

Or we can use the point (8, 3):
$y - 3 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 8)$

Or we can use the point (11, 5):
$y - 5 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 11)$

All of these equations are equivalent. Let's choose the equation using the point (2, -1):
$y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$

Final Answer: $y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $y + 1 = \frac{2}{3}(x - 2)$
