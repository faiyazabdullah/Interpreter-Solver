QUESTION:
A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions, splitted by a middle base. Length of middle base is 8, height of upper square pyramid is 2x+3, height of whole square pyramid is 6x+9.

Find an expression for the length L of the base of the pyramid in terms of the variable, x.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the height of the whole pyramid be $H = 6x+9$, and the height of the upper pyramid be $h = 2x+3$.
Let the length of the base of the whole pyramid be $L$, and the length of the base of the upper pyramid be $l=8$.
Since the upper pyramid is similar to the whole pyramid, we have the ratio of corresponding lengths equal.
That is, $\frac{l}{L} = \frac{h}{H}$.
Substituting the given values, we have $\frac{8}{L} = \frac{2x+3}{6x+9}$.
We can factor the denominator to get $\frac{8}{L} = \frac{2x+3}{3(2x+3)}$.
Simplifying, we have $\frac{8}{L} = \frac{1}{3}$.
Cross-multiplying, we get $L = 8 \cdot 3 = 24$.
Since $L$ is a constant, the expression for $L$ is simply $L=24$.

Final Answer: $24$
