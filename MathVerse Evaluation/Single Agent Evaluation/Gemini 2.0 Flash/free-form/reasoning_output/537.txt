QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The period of a trigonometric function is the distance between two consecutive maximums or two consecutive minimums. In this case, we are given a maximum and a minimum. The distance between a maximum and a minimum is half the period. Therefore, we can find the period by doubling the horizontal distance between the maximum and the minimum.
The maximum is at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and the minimum is at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. The horizontal distance between these two points is $\frac{3}{4} \pi - \frac{1}{4} \pi = \frac{2}{4} \pi = \frac{1}{2} \pi$.
Since this is half the period, the period is $2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \pi = \pi$.

Final Answer: $\pi$
