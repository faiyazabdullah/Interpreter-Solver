QUESTION:
The radius of the figure is $ 13 \mathrm{~mm}$. It follows that a two thirds of a circle has area $\frac{2}{3} \pi r^{2}$. Find the exact area of the shape shown, which is two thirds of a circle.

The radius of the figure is given as $r = 13 \text{ mm}$. We are asked to find the area of two thirds of a circle with this radius.
The area of a full circle is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$. Therefore, the area of two thirds of a circle is given by $\frac{2}{3} \pi r^2$.
Substituting $r = 13 \text{ mm}$ into the formula, we get
$$ \frac{2}{3} \pi (13 \text{ mm})^2 = \frac{2}{3} \pi (169 \text{ mm}^2) = \frac{338}{3} \pi \text{ mm}^2 $$

Final Answer: $\frac{338}{3}\pi \text{ mm}^2$
