QUESTION:
The top of a solid cone was sawed off to form the solid attached. The top cone has a diameter of 8cm and slant height of 8cm. The solid cone has a diameter of 4cm. The solid left has a slant height of 8cm. Find the surface area of the solid formed, correct to two decimal places.

Let the diameter of the top cone be $d_1 = 2$ cm, and its slant height be $l_1 = 8$ cm.
Let the diameter of the bottom cone be $d_2 = 4$ cm, and the slant height of the frustum be $l_2 = 8$ cm.
The radius of the top cone is $r_1 = d_1/2 = 2/2 = 1$ cm.
The radius of the bottom cone is $r_2 = d_2/2 = 4/2 = 2$ cm.

The surface area of the frustum of a cone is given by $\pi (r_1 + r_2) l + \pi r_1^2 + \pi r_2^2$, where $l$ is the slant height.  However, in this case, the top is missing so the surface area is
$\pi (r_1 + r_2) l_2 + \pi r_2^2$.
The lateral surface area of the frustum is $\pi (r_1 + r_2) l_2 = \pi (1 + 2) (8) = 24\pi \text{ cm}^2$.
The area of the bottom circle is $\pi r_2^2 = \pi (2^2) = 4\pi \text{ cm}^2$.
Therefore, the total surface area of the solid is $24\pi + 4\pi = 28\pi \text{ cm}^2$.

We are given the radius of the top as 1 and its slant height as 8.
Also the radius of the bottom circle is 2 and the slant height of the frustum is 8.
We want to find the surface area of the solid formed, which is the surface area of the frustum. The surface area of the frustum is given by
$A = \pi(r_1 + r_2)l + \pi r_2^2$, where $l$ is the slant height.
In this case, $r_1 = 1$, $r_2 = 2$, and $l = 8$. Thus,
$A = \pi(1+2)(8) + \pi (2^2) = \pi(3)(8) + 4\pi = 24\pi + 4\pi = 28\pi$.

Using the value of $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we have $28\pi \approx 28(3.14159) \approx 87.96452$.
Rounding to two decimal places, we get $87.96 \text{ cm}^2$.

Final Answer: $28\pi \text{ cm}^2$
Final Answer: $28\pi \text{ cm}^2 \approx 87.96 \text{ cm}^2$
