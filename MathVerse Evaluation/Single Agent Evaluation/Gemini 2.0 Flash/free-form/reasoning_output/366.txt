QUESTION:
A ship is 27m away from the bottom of a cliff. A lighthouse is located at the top of the cliff. The ship's distance is 34m from the bottom of the lighthouse and 37m from the top of the lighthouse.
Hence find the height of the lighthouse to the nearest tenth of a metre.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let the height of the cliff be $x$ meters, and let the height of the lighthouse be $y-x$ meters.
We are given that the ship is 27m away from the bottom of the cliff.
The distance from the ship to the bottom of the lighthouse is 34m.
The distance from the ship to the top of the lighthouse is 37m.

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the triangle formed by the ship, the bottom of the cliff, and the bottom of the lighthouse, we have:
$27^2 + x^2 = 34^2$
$729 + x^2 = 1156$
$x^2 = 1156 - 729$
$x^2 = 427$
$x = \sqrt{427} \approx 20.6635$

Using the Pythagorean theorem for the triangle formed by the ship, the bottom of the cliff, and the top of the lighthouse, we have:
$27^2 + y^2 = 37^2$
$729 + y^2 = 1369$
$y^2 = 1369 - 729$
$y^2 = 640$
$y = \sqrt{640} = 8\sqrt{10} \approx 25.2982$

The height of the lighthouse is $y - x = \sqrt{640} - \sqrt{427} \approx 25.2982 - 20.6635 \approx 4.6347$
Rounding to the nearest tenth of a metre, we get 4.6m.

Final Answer: $4.6 \text{m}$
