QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The longest straw that can fit in the can will be the diagonal of the cylinder, from one corner of the base to the opposite corner of the top. The height of the cylinder is 13 cm, and the diameter of the base is $2 \times 3 = 6$ cm. Let $L$ be the length of the straw. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find $L$. The length $L$ is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of length 13 cm (height) and 6 cm (diameter).
$L^2 = 13^2 + 6^2 = 169 + 36 = 205$
$L = \sqrt{205} \approx 14.3178$
Since we need to round down to the nearest cm, the length of the longest straw that can fit in the can is 14 cm.

Final Answer: $14$
