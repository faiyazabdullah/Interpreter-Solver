QUESTION:
A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

The rectangular box has vertices at (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), and (40,0). This means the length of the rectangle is 40 cm and the width is 20 cm.

The largest possible ellipse that can fit inside this rectangle will have its major and minor axes aligned with the sides of the rectangle. The center of this ellipse will be at the center of the rectangle.

To find the coordinates of the center, we can average the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates of opposite vertices of the rectangle.
For example, using the vertices (0,0) and (40,20):
x-coordinate of center = (0 + 40) / 2 = 20
y-coordinate of center = (0 + 20) / 2 = 10

Alternatively, using the vertices (0,20) and (40,0):
x-coordinate of center = (0 + 40) / 2 = 20
y-coordinate of center = (20 + 0) / 2 = 10

So, the center of the ellipse is at the point (20, 10).

Final Answer: $(20, 10)$
