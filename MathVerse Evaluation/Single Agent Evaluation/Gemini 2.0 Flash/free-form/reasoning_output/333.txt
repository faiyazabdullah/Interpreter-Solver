QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 37Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.

From the diagram, we are given that the bearing of $M$ is $323^\circ$. This means that the angle measured clockwise from the north direction to the line $MS$ is $360^\circ - 323^\circ = 37^\circ$ (where $S$ denotes South). Since $MS$ points South, it has a bearing of $180^\circ$.
We are also given that $\angle PMS = 37^\circ$.

The bearing of $P$ from $M$ is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction at $M$ to the point $P$.
The bearing of $M$ is $323^\circ$.
The angle between $MS$ and the north direction at $M$ is $180^\circ$.
Since $S$ denotes the South cardinal point, the direction from $M$ to $S$ is $180^\circ$.
We have $\angle PMS = 37^\circ$.

Let $x$ be the bearing of $P$ from $M$.
The angle measured clockwise from the north direction to the line $MS$ is $180^\circ$. We are given that $\angle PMS = 37^\circ$.
The bearing of $P$ from $M$ can be calculated by adding $\angle PMS$ to the bearing of $S$ from $M$, and subtracting from $360^\circ$ if the result exceeds $360^\circ$.
So the bearing of $P$ from $M$ is $180^\circ + 37^\circ = 217^\circ$.
Alternatively, the bearing of $P$ from $M$ can be calculated as $360^\circ - (360^\circ - 323^\circ) - 37^\circ = 360^\circ - 37^\circ - 37^\circ = 360^\circ - 74^\circ = 286^\circ$.
Then $360^\circ - (323^\circ - 37^\circ) = 360^\circ - 286^\circ = 74^\circ$.

Let $N$ be the north direction from point $M$. Then $\angle NMS = 180^\circ$.
We are given $\angle PMS = 37^\circ$. Thus, $\angle NMP = \angle NMS + \angle SMP = 180^\circ + 37^\circ$.
The bearing of $P$ from $M$ is given by $180^\circ + 37^\circ = 217^\circ$. Since $323^\circ$ is measured from the north direction, it is measured counter clockwise. Thus $323^\circ$. We want to find $\angle NMP = 323^\circ - x$ and $\angle PMS = x$.

The bearing of P from M is $180^\circ + 37^\circ = 217^\circ$.

Final Answer: $217^\circ$
