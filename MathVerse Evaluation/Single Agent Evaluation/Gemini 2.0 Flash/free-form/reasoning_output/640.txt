QUESTION:
A hollow cylindrical pipe has the dimensions shown in the figure. The outer diameter is 2.1 centimeters. The inner diameter is 1.8 centimeters. The length is 13 centimeters.

The pipe is made of a particularly strong metal.

Calculate the weight of the pipe if 1 (cm)^3 of the metal weighs 5.3g , giving your answer correct to one decimal place.

The problem asks us to calculate the weight of a hollow cylindrical pipe. We are given the outer diameter, inner diameter, and length of the pipe. We are also given the weight of 1 cm^3 of the metal.

First, we need to find the volume of the metal used to make the pipe. This can be found by subtracting the volume of the inner cylinder (the hollow part) from the volume of the outer cylinder.

The outer diameter is 2.1 cm, so the outer radius $r_o$ is $2.1/2 = 1.05$ cm.
The inner diameter is 1.8 cm, so the inner radius $r_i$ is $1.8/2 = 0.9$ cm.
The length of the pipe (height of the cylinder) is $h = 13$ cm.

The volume of the outer cylinder is $V_o = \pi r_o^2 h = \pi (1.05)^2 (13) = \pi (1.1025)(13) = 14.3325\pi$ cm$^3$.
The volume of the inner cylinder is $V_i = \pi r_i^2 h = \pi (0.9)^2 (13) = \pi (0.81)(13) = 10.53\pi$ cm$^3$.

The volume of the metal is $V = V_o - V_i = 14.3325\pi - 10.53\pi = 3.8025\pi$ cm$^3$.
$V \approx 3.8025 \times 3.14159 \approx 11.9459$ cm$^3$.

Now we need to find the weight of the pipe. We know that 1 cm$^3$ of the metal weighs 5.3 g.
So, the weight of the pipe is $W = V \times 5.3 = 11.9459 \times 5.3 \approx 63.31327$ g.
Rounding to one decimal place, the weight of the pipe is 63.3 g.

Final Answer: $63.3 \text{ g}$
