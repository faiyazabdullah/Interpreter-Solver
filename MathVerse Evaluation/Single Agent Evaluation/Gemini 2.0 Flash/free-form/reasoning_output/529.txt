QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function with a yellow point labeled ($-\frac{\pi}{3},2). It has a maximum point at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2\right)$ and an amplitude of 1.8 . What is the midline equation of the function?

The graph shows a trigonometric function. We are given that the maximum point is at $(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2)$ and the amplitude is 1.8.
The amplitude of a trigonometric function is half the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the function.
Let $M$ be the maximum value and $m$ be the minimum value of the function. Then the amplitude $A = \frac{M - m}{2}$.
We are given that the amplitude is $A = 1.8$ and the maximum value is $M = 2$.
So, $1.8 = \frac{2 - m}{2}$.
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get $3.6 = 2 - m$.
Thus, $m = 2 - 3.6 = -1.6$.
The midline of the trigonometric function is the horizontal line that is halfway between the maximum and minimum values. The equation of the midline is $y = \frac{M + m}{2}$.
In our case, $y = \frac{2 + (-1.6)}{2} = \frac{0.4}{2} = 0.2$.

Final Answer: $y=0.2$
