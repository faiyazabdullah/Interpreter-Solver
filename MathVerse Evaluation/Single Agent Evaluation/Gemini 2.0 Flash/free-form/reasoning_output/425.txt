QUESTION:
An industrial site in the shape of a triangle is to take up the space between where three roads intersect. The triangle has an angle of 44° and two sides of 50m and 80m.

Calculate the area of the site.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
Area = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C), where a and b are the lengths of two sides, and C is the angle between them.

In this case, a = 50 m, b = 80 m, and C = 44°.
Area = (1/2) * 50 * 80 * sin(44°)
Area = 2000 * sin(44°)
Area ≈ 2000 * 0.694658
Area ≈ 1389.316 m²

Rounding to two decimal places, the area is approximately 1389.32 m².

Final Answer: $\text{Area} = 1389.32 \text{ m}^2$
