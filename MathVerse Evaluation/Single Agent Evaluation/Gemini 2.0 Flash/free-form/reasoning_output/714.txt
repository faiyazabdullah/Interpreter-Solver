The given figure is a prism composed of a rectangular prism and a triangular prism.
The dimensions of the rectangular prism are 6m (height), 5m (width), and 10m (length).
The dimensions of the triangular prism are: base = 5m, height = 3m, and length = 10m.
First, we calculate the surface area of the rectangular prism.
The faces are:
Top and bottom: $5 \times 10 = 50 \text{m}^2$ each, so $2 \times 50 = 100 \text{m}^2$
Front and back: $6 \times 5 = 30 \text{m}^2$ each, so $2 \times 30 = 60 \text{m}^2$
Sides: $6 \times 10 = 60 \text{m}^2$ each, so $2 \times 60 = 120 \text{m}^2$
The total surface area of the rectangular prism is $100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \text{m}^2$.
However, the top face of the rectangular prism is covered by the triangular prism, so we subtract this area. The area is $5 \times 10 = 50 \text{m}^2$.
The surface area of the rectangular prism is $280 - 50 = 230 \text{m}^2$.

Now we calculate the surface area of the triangular prism.
The two triangular faces have area $\frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 3 = 7.5 \text{m}^2$ each. So the area of the two faces is $2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{m}^2$.
The bottom face is $5 \times 10 = 50 \text{m}^2$, but this face is touching the rectangular prism.
The other two faces are rectangles with sides 10m and the length of the edge of the triangle.
Since the height of the triangle is 3m and the base is 5m, each half of the base is 2.5m.
Let $x$ be the length of the marked edges on the triangular faces.
$x^2 = 3^2 + 2.5^2 = 9 + 6.25 = 15.25$
$x = \sqrt{15.25} \approx 3.905 \text{m}$
The area of each of the rectangular faces is $10 \times x = 10 \times \sqrt{15.25} \approx 10 \times 3.905 = 39.05 \text{m}^2$
So the total area of these two faces is $2 \times 39.05 = 78.1 \text{m}^2$
The surface area of the triangular prism is $15 + 78.1 = 93.1 \text{m}^2$.

Total surface area is $230 + 93.1 = 323.1 \text{m}^2$.

Final Answer: $323.10$
