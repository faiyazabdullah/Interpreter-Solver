QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

The soft drink can is in the shape of a cylinder. The height of the cylinder is given as 13 cm and the radius is given as 3 cm. We need to find the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can. This is the length of the diagonal of the cylinder.
The longest straw that can fit into the can would be the diagonal of a rectangle formed by the height of the cylinder and the diameter of the circular base.
The diameter of the base is $2r = 2 \times 3 = 6$ cm.
We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the straw, $L$.
$L^2 = h^2 + d^2$, where $h$ is the height of the cylinder and $d$ is the diameter of the base.
$L^2 = 13^2 + 6^2 = 169 + 36 = 205$
$L = \sqrt{205} \approx 14.3178$ cm
Since we need to round down to the nearest cm, we get $L = 14$ cm.

Final Answer: $14$
