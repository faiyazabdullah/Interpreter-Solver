The graph appears to be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. This means that if we reflect the graph across the y-axis, it will look the same. This is the definition of an even function.
Alternatively, an even function satisfies the condition $f(x) = f(-x)$ for all $x$. In other words, if we plug in $x$ and $-x$ into the function, we should get the same output.
An odd function, on the other hand, satisfies the condition $f(-x) = -f(x)$. The graph of an odd function is symmetric with respect to the origin.
Since the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis, the function is even.

Final Answer: $even$
