QUESTION:
After two meteoroids collide at point A, one starts travelling in the direction of point B, while the other starts travelling in the direction of point C, with an angle of 53^\circ  between the two directions. The meteoroid projected in the direction of B is moving at a speed of 7860 km/h, while the other is moving at a speed of 10170 km/h.


What distance will the meteoroid travelling towards point B have covered after 29 minutes?

GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:

The problem states that a meteoroid is traveling towards point B with a speed of 7860 km/h. We need to find the distance it covers in 29 minutes.

First, we convert 29 minutes to hours:
$29 \text{ minutes} = \frac{29}{60} \text{ hours}$

Now, we can use the formula distance = speed Ã— time:
$\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}$
$\text{Distance} = 7860 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{h}} \times \frac{29}{60} \text{ h}$
$\text{Distance} = \frac{7860 \times 29}{60} \text{ km}$
$\text{Distance} = \frac{228}{2} \text{km}$
$\text{Distance} = \frac{227940}{60} \text{ km}$
$\text{Distance} = 3799 \text{ km}$

So, the distance the meteoroid travelling towards point B covers in 29 minutes is 3799 km.

Final Answer: $3799 \text{ km}$
