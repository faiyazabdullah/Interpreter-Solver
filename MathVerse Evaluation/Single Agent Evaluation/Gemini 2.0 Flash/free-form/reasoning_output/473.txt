QUESTION:
A rectangle contains an ellipse. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). The center of the ellipse is (20,10), and its four vertices are (0,10), (20,10), (20,20), (40,10). A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

The rectangle has vertices (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), and (40,0). The ellipse is contained within this rectangle. The center of the ellipse is given as (20,10). The question asks for the coordinates of the center of the cake, which is shaped as an ellipse. The rectangular box has dimensions 40 cm in length and 20 cm in width.
The problem states that the cake is in the shape of an ellipse that fits inside the rectangular box. The center of the ellipse is given as (20, 10). Thus, the center of the cake is the same as the center of the ellipse that fits inside the rectangular box.

Final Answer: $(20, 10)$
