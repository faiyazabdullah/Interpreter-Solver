The given figure is a triangular prism. The base is an isosceles triangle with base 12 cm and the equal sides (waist) are 10 cm each. The height of the triangle is 8 cm. The length of the prism is 21 cm.
We need to find the surface area of the triangular prism.
The surface area of a triangular prism is given by
$SA = 2 \times (\text{Area of the triangle}) + (\text{Perimeter of the triangle}) \times (\text{Height of the prism})$
The area of the triangle is given by
$A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{cm} \times 8 \text{cm} = 48 \text{cm}^2$
The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of the lengths of the three sides:
$P = 10 \text{cm} + 10 \text{cm} + 12 \text{cm} = 32 \text{cm}$
The height of the prism is given as 21 cm.
So, the surface area of the triangular prism is:
$SA = 2 \times (48 \text{cm}^2) + (32 \text{cm}) \times (21 \text{cm}) = 96 \text{cm}^2 + 672 \text{cm}^2 = 768 \text{cm}^2$

Final Answer: $\text{Surface Area} = 768 \text{cm}^2$
