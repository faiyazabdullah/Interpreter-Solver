QUESTION:
In the figure above. The graph consists of four lines l,m,n,p intersecting each other. Line l and line p are perpendicular. If the angle (not shown) where lines n and p intersect is twice as large as the angle (also not shown) where lines l and m intersect, what is the value of x?

Let's analyze the given geometric figure.
We are given that line $l$ and line $p$ are perpendicular, so the angle between them is $90^\circ$.
Also, the angle between lines $m$ and $p$ is $110^\circ$.
Let the angle between lines $l$ and $m$ be $\alpha$.
Let the angle between lines $n$ and $p$ be $2\alpha$.

Since the angle between lines $m$ and $p$ is $110^\circ$, the supplementary angle is $180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ$. So the other angle formed by the intersection of lines $m$ and $p$ is $70^\circ$.

Now, let's focus on the triangle formed by lines $l$, $m$ and $p$.
The angles in the triangle are $90^\circ$, $70^\circ$ and the angle between lines $l$ and $m$ which is $\alpha$.
Therefore, the sum of the angles is $90^\circ + 70^\circ + \alpha = 180^\circ$.
Thus, $160^\circ + \alpha = 180^\circ$, which means $\alpha = 180^\circ - 160^\circ = 20^\circ$.

The angle between lines $n$ and $p$ is $2\alpha$, so $2\alpha = 2(20^\circ) = 40^\circ$.
The angles on a straight line add up to $180^\circ$. So the angle between lines $n$ and $p$ on the other side is $180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ$.

Now, we want to find the value of $x$.
Looking at the intersection of lines $l$ and $n$, $x$ is an angle formed by these lines.
Since the lines $l, m, n, p$ form a quadrilateral, we can use the fact that the sum of the interior angles is $(4-2) \times 180^\circ = 360^\circ$.
However, we have the angle $90^\circ$, the angle $110^\circ$. Also we have $x$ and the angle between $m$ and $n$.
Let's consider the quadrilateral formed by segments of lines $l, m, n, p$. The interior angles are $90^\circ$, $110^\circ$, $x$ and $2\alpha$
The angle between $n$ and $m$ is not explicitly given.

We can relate angle $x$ to angle $\alpha$.
Let's consider the angles around the intersection of lines $l$ and $n$. The angle $x$ is one of the angles, and the other angle is $180 - x$.
The vertical angle to $x$ is $x$.

Let's look at the quadrilateral formed by the intersection of lines $l, m, n, p$.
The angles are $90^\circ$, $110^\circ$, and the two supplementary angles for $x$ and $2 \alpha$.
So the angles add up to $90 + 110 + x + 2 \alpha + supplementary angles = 360$

We have $2\alpha=40$. The supplementary angle is $140$.

We have triangle with vertices on line $l$ and line $p$ at the 90 angle, and where line $m$ meets lines $l$ and $p$
$90 + 70 + alpha = 180 so $alpha = 20$

$x + \alpha + 20 + 140 -20 = $
$x+ 2 alpha = angle$
$x+40 + 90+110=180$

Consider the straight line for x. $180 - x = angle$

In this problem, we cannot determine the exact geometry due to the lack of information to properly analyze, but based on the triangle at lines l, m, p, we could compute the angle to be 20, then $x=30$ based on $90-60$
Final Answer: $20$
