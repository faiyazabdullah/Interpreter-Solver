QUESTION:
Sand has an angle of friction of about 40°. This means once it gets over this it slides down the side of the sand pile. Mae is getting a delivery of sand to her home, but the area where the sand will be delivered is only 10.6 metres wide. If h metres is the maximum height of the sandpile, find h to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
GEMINI VISION MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
The sand pile forms a triangle. The width of the base is 10.6 metres. The angle of friction is 40°.
The maximum height of the sand pile $h$ is the height of the triangle.
The base of the triangle is 10.6 m, so half of the base is $10.6/2 = 5.3$ m.
Let $\theta$ be the angle of friction, which is $40^\circ$.
Then $\tan(\theta) = \frac{h}{\text{half of the base}} = \frac{h}{5.3}$
$h = 5.3 \tan(\theta) = 5.3 \tan(40^\circ)$
$\tan(40^\circ) \approx 0.8391$
$h \approx 5.3 \times 0.8391 \approx 4.44723$
We need to find $h$ to one decimal place.
$h \approx 4.4$ metres

Final Answer: $4.4 \text{m}$
