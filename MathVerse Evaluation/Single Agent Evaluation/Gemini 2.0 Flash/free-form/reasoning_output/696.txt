QUESTION:
Find the volume of the figure shown, correct to two decimal places. The inner cylinder has a radius of 4 cm and the outer cylinder has a radius of 9 cm. The height of both cylinders is 2 cm.

The figure consists of two cylinders. The smaller cylinder on top has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 2 cm. The larger cylinder at the bottom has a radius of 9 cm and a height of 2 cm.
The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height.

The volume of the smaller cylinder is $V_1 = \pi (4^2)(2) = \pi (16)(2) = 32\pi \text{ cm}^3$.
The volume of the larger cylinder is $V_2 = \pi (9^2)(2) = \pi (81)(2) = 162\pi \text{ cm}^3$.

The total volume of the figure is the sum of the volumes of the two cylinders:
$V = V_1 + V_2 = 32\pi + 162\pi = 194\pi \text{ cm}^3$.

We can approximate $\pi \approx 3.14159$, so $V = 194 \times 3.14159 \approx 609.45 \text{ cm}^3$.
Rounding to two decimal places, we have $V \approx 609.47 \text{ cm}^3$.

Final Answer: $194\pi \approx 609.47 \text{ cm}^3$
Final Answer: $609.47 \text{ cm}^3$
