QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the cylindrical water tank is 3x and the radius of its base is 5x+3. The cylindrical water tank is leaking at a constant rate of 3\pi x litres per second (where x is a fixed unknown). If the water tank was initially full, calculate the amount of water remaining after \left(2x+2\right)^2 seconds. Give your simplified answer in expanded form.

The problem describes a cylindrical water tank with height $3x$ and radius $5x+3$. The tank leaks at a rate of $3\pi x$ liters per second. We need to find the amount of water remaining after $(2x+2)^2$ seconds, assuming the tank was initially full.

First, we need to find the volume of the cylindrical tank. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height. In this case, $r = 5x+3$ and $h = 3x$. So, the volume of the tank is:
$V = \pi (5x+3)^2 (3x) = 3\pi x (25x^2 + 30x + 9) = \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x)$.

Next, we need to find the amount of water that has leaked out of the tank after $(2x+2)^2$ seconds. The tank leaks at a rate of $3\pi x$ liters per second. So, after $(2x+2)^2$ seconds, the amount of water leaked is:
$3\pi x (2x+2)^2 = 3\pi x (4x^2 + 8x + 4) = \pi (12x^3 + 24x^2 + 12x)$.

Finally, to find the amount of water remaining in the tank, we subtract the amount of water leaked from the initial volume of the tank:
$\text{Remaining Volume} = \text{Initial Volume} - \text{Volume Leaked} = \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x) - \pi (12x^3 + 24x^2 + 12x) = \pi (75x^3 - 12x^3 + 90x^2 - 24x^2 + 27x - 12x) = \pi (63x^3 + 66x^2 + 15x)$.

Final Answer: $\pi(63x^3 + 66x^2 + 15x)$
