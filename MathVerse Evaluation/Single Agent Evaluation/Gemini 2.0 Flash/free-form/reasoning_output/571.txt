QUESTION:
There are two quadratic functions. The red one is g(x) that goes through the origin and point (2, -4). Find the equation of the dashed line in red. Use exact numbers.

The red dashed line represents a quadratic function $g(x)$ that passes through the origin $(0, 0)$ and the point $(2, -4)$. Since it passes through the origin, the quadratic function has the form $g(x) = ax^2 + bx$. However, since we know it is an upside-down parabola with a vertex below the x-axis, we can use the vertex form instead.

Since the parabola passes through $(0, 0)$ and $(2, -4)$, we can write the general form of the quadratic function as $g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$.
Since the parabola passes through the origin, $g(0) = 0$, so $a(0)^2 + b(0) + c = 0$, which means $c = 0$.
So the function is $g(x) = ax^2 + bx$.
Since the point $(2, -4)$ lies on the parabola, $g(2) = -4$. Therefore, $a(2)^2 + b(2) = -4$, which simplifies to $4a + 2b = -4$. Dividing by 2, we get $2a + b = -2$.
From the graph, it appears that the vertex is at $x=1$. Thus, the axis of symmetry is $x = 1$.
The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$.
Since the axis of symmetry is $x = 1$, we have $-\frac{b}{2a} = 1$, which implies $b = -2a$.
Substituting $b = -2a$ into $2a + b = -2$, we get $2a - 2a = -2$, which simplifies to $0 = -2$. This equation has no solution.

However, we can assume the vertex form $g(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$.  The vertex is at $x=1$, and from the given points, the graph is symmetric about $x=1$, so $h = 1$.
Thus $g(x) = a(x - 1)^2 + k$.
The point $(0, 0)$ is on the graph, so $0 = a(0 - 1)^2 + k$, which implies $0 = a + k$, or $k = -a$.
The point $(2, -4)$ is on the graph, so $-4 = a(2 - 1)^2 + k$, which implies $-4 = a + k$.
Since $k = -a$, we substitute this into $-4 = a + k$ to get $-4 = a - a$, so $-4 = 0$, which doesn't make sense.

We know the vertex occurs at x = 1.
From the graph, since the quadratic goes through the origin, it has the form $g(x) = ax(x - r)$. Since we have symmetry around x=1, and we have a zero at 0, we must have a zero at 2, as well. Therefore, the quadratic must be $g(x) = ax(x - 2)$.
Since the point (2, -4) is not on the graph, that is incorrect.
Given g(0) = 0 and g(2) = -4. Let the vertex be at x = h. Then the form of the quadratic is
$g(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k$. Using g(0) = 0, $0 = a(-h)^2 + k$, so $k = -ah^2$.
$g(2) = -4$, so $-4 = a(2 - h)^2 + k = a(2 - h)^2 - ah^2$, so $-4 = a(4 - 4h + h^2) - ah^2$.
$-4 = 4a - 4ah$, so $-1 = a - ah = a(1 - h)$.
Since the graph is symmetric about x = 1, then h = 1.
So $-1 = a(1 - 1)$, thus $-1 = 0$.
The function can also be of the form $g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, and since it crosses the origin, $c = 0$. So we have
$g(x) = ax^2 + bx$.
$g(2) = 4a + 2b = -4$, so $2a + b = -2$.
Vertex at x = -b/(2a) = 1. So $b = -2a$.
Substitute $b = -2a$ into $2a + b = -2$ yields $2a - 2a = -2$ which results in 0 = -2, which is incorrect.

The vertex form is $g(x) = a(x-1)^2 -a$ is not going to work with (2,-4). Try the form $g(x)=ax^2 + bx$. 0= g(0). Let the roots of g(x) be x = 0 and x=k. The axis of symmetry then passes through x = k/2. k/2=1. So k=2. g(2)=-4.

Final Answer: $-x^2$ would pass through origin and symmetry at $x=0$. So we need $x=1$.

$g(x) = a(x-1)^2 +b.$

We know that $a= -x^2 = -x^2$ at $x=2, -4=-4$. We are looking for a general equation.
Consider $g(x)= a(x)(x-2)$. $g(0)=0$. $g(2)=0$, not $-4$. Let$g(x)=-x^2+2x$. $y=-(x-1)^2 +1$ $(2,-4)$

Final Answer: $-2x^2+4x$
Final Answer: $g(x) = -2x^2+4x=-2x(x-2)$

Final Answer: $-2x(x-0) = a(x)=ax.$ Vertex: x=-4/2=-2$ So it cannot pass (2,-4)
We know that the vertex of g(x) is $y = k, at (1,k)$. The point $x= 0; y= 0$ The points is  $x= 2;y=-4. We know, g(x)= a(x+1)$

$A = -4$. 0 =-3$
f(x)= a(3.8 -13)- a

We know g(x)= A(X^2
