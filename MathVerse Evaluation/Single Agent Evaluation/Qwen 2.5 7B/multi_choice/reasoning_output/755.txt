QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find \(x^2 + y^2\), we need to analyze the geometric configuration and use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the right triangles and their side lengths**:
   - The triangles have side lengths \(\sqrt{3}\), \(\sqrt{7}\), \(\sqrt{10}\), and \(\sqrt{6}\).

2. **Understand the structure**:
   - The triangles are arranged such that they form an irregular quadrilateral.
   - We need to find the lengths \(x\) and \(y\).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**:
   - For each right triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse.

4. **Calculate \(x^2 + y^2\)**:
   - Since the triangles are right triangles and the figure is formed by combining them, the sum of the squares of the sides can be deduced from the given lengths.
   - The total length of the sides forms a larger right triangle where the hypotenuses are combined.

5. **Summing up the squares**:
   - Calculate the squares of the given sides and sum them up:
     \[
     (\sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{7})^2 + (\sqrt{10})^2 + (\sqrt{6})^2
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     3 + 7 + 10 + 6 = 26
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The sum of the squares of the sides of the smaller triangles is 26.
   - Since these triangles combine to form the larger figure, the sum of the squares of the sides of the larger figure should also be 26.

Thus, the value of \(x^2 + y^2\) is 26.
