QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the student Xiao Li whose height is 1.6 wants to measure the height of the school's flagpole. When he stands at C, the shadow of the top of his head coincides with the shadow of the top of the flagpole, and AC = 2.0, BC = 8.0, then the height of the flagpole is ()

CHOICES:
A:6.4米
B:7米
C:8米
D:9米

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. The triangles formed by the student and the flagpole with their respective shadows are similar because the sun's rays are parallel.

Given:
- AC = 2.0 meters
- BC = 8.0 meters
- Height of Xiao Li (student) = 1.6 meters

Let's denote the height of the flagpole as \( h \).

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of student}}{\text{Distance from student to point where shadow ends}} = \frac{\text{Height of flagpole}}{\text{Total distance from student to flagpole}}
\]

This can be written as:

\[
\frac{1.6}{2.0} = \frac{h}{2.0 + 8.0}
\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[
\frac{1.6}{2.0} = \frac{h}{10.0}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( h \):

\[
1.6 \times 10.0 = 2.0 \times h
\]

\[
16.0 = 2.0h
\]

Dividing both sides by 2.0:

\[
h = \frac{16.0}{2.0} = 8.0
\]

Thus, the height of the flagpole is 8.0 meters.
