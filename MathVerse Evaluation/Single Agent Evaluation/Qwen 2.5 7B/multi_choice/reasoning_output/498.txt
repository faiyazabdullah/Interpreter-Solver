QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-2,0), (0,0), (2,0). Use the vertical line test to determine if this relation is a function.

CHOICES:
A.This is a function
B.This is not a function

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the relation is a function, we need to use the vertical line test. According to the vertical line test, if any vertical line intersects the graph of the relation more than once, then the relation is not a function.

In the given image, the curve passes through the points (-2, 0), (0, 0), and (2, 0). We can see that for each x-coordinate value, there is only one corresponding y-coordinate value. Therefore, no vertical line will intersect the graph at more than one point.

Thus, the relation represented by this curve is a function.
