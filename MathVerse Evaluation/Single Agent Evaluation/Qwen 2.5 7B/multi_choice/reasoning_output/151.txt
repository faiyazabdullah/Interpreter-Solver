QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, a student saw a tree by the lake. He visually observed that the distance between himself and the tree is 20.0, and the reflection of the top of the tree in the water is 5.0 far away from him. The student's height is 1.7, and the height of the tree is ( ).

CHOICES:
A:3.4
B:5.1
C:6.8
D:8.5

====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the Similar Triangles**:
   - Triangle formed by the student, the ground, and the point where the student sees the top of the tree.
   - Triangle formed by the reflection of the top of the tree in the water, the ground, and the point where the student sees the reflection.

2. **Set Up the Proportions**:
   - Let \( h \) be the height of the tree.
   - The distance from the student to the tree is 20 meters.
   - The distance from the student to the reflection of the top of the tree is 5 meters.
   - The height of the student is 1.7 meters.

   Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Height of the tree}}{\text{Distance to the tree}} = \frac{\text{Height of the student}}{\text{Distance to the reflection}}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \frac{h}{20} = \frac{1.7}{5}
   \]

3. **Solve for \( h \)**:
   \[
   h = 1.7 \times \frac{20}{5}
   \]
   \[
   h = 1.7 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   h = 6.8
   \]

Thus, the height of the tree is 6.8 meters.
