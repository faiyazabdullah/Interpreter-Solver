QUESTION:
Do the following graph, a line which passes (-6,0) and (0,2) and the slope of the line > 0, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine whether the function has an inverse, we need to check if it is one-to-one (injective). A function is one-to-one if every x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value, and vice versa. This can be determined by checking if the function is strictly increasing or decreasing.

Given the points (-6, 0) and (0, 2), we can calculate the slope of the line:

\[ \text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-6)} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Since the slope is positive (\(\frac{1}{3}\)), the line is strictly increasing. Therefore, for every unique x-value, there is a unique y-value, and vice versa. Hence, the function is one-to-one.

Since the function is one-to-one, it has an inverse function.
