QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through the origin. Use the vertical line test to determine if this relation is a function.

CHOICES:
A:This is a function
B:This is not a function

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the relation is a function using the vertical line test:

1. Examine the graph of the curve.
2. The curve passes through the origin (0, 0).
3. The vertical line test states that for every x-value, there can be only one y-value for the relation to be a function.

In the graph, the curve appears to pass the vertical line test as it does not intersect any vertical line more than once. Therefore, each x-value corresponds to only one y-value.

Final Answer: A
