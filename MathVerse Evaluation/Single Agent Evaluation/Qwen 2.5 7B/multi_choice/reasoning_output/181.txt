To solve the problem, we need to use the fact that AB is the diameter of the circle O. This implies that angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always a right angle.

Given:
- OC = 5
- AC = 6
- AB is the diameter of circle O

Since OC is a radius of the circle and AB is the diameter, the radius of the circle is half of AB. Let's denote the radius as \( r \). Therefore, AB = 2r. We can find AB using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OCB:

\[ OB^2 = OC^2 + CB^2 \]

Since OB is the radius, OB = r, and OC = 5, we have:

\[ r^2 = 5^2 + CB^2 \]
\[ r^2 = 25 + CB^2 \]

We also know that AB = 2r, so:

\[ AB = 2r \]

Now, let's substitute \( r^2 \) from the previous equation into the expression for AB:

\[ AB = 2\sqrt{25 + CB^2} \]

Since AB is the hypotenuse of the right triangle ACB, we can use the Pythagorean theorem again:

\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \]
\[ (2r)^2 = 6^2 + BC^2 \]
\[ 4r^2 = 36 + BC^2 \]

We already have \( r^2 = 25 + BC^2 \), so substituting this in:

\[ 4(25 + BC^2) = 36 + BC^2 \]
\[ 100 + 4BC^2 = 36 + BC^2 \]
\[ 3BC^2 = -64 \]

This seems incorrect, so let's recheck our steps. The correct approach is to use the fact that AB is the hypotenuse and directly calculate BC using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \]
\[ AB = \sqrt{AC^2 + BC^2} \]

Since AB is the diameter, let's assume AB = d, then:

\[ d^2 = 6^2 + BC^2 \]
\[ d^2 = 36 + BC^2 \]

Since AB is the diameter, let's use the correct radius calculation:

\[ AB = 2r \]
\[ d = 2r \]
\[ d^2 = 4r^2 \]
\[ 4r^2 = 36 + BC^2 \]

Using the correct radius:

\[ r^2 = 25 + BC^2 \]
\[ 4(25 + BC^2) = 36 + BC^2 \]
\[ 100 + 4BC^2 = 36 + BC^2 \]
\[ 3BC^2 = -64 \]

This seems incorrect, so let's use the correct approach:

\[ AB = \sqrt{36 + BC^2} \]
\[ AB = 10 \]

So, the length of BC is:

\[ BC = 8 \]
