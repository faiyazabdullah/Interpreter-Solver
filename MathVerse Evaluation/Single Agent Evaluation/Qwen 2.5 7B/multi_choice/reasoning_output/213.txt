QUESTION:
In \odot P, the radius is 2 inches. \angle Q P T is 112 degrees, and \angle RPS is 130 degrees. Find the length of \widehat R S. Round to the nearest hundredth.

CHOICES:
A:2.27
B:3.91
C:4.54
D:7.82

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:

To find the length of the arc RS, we need to use the relationship between the central angle and the arc length in a circle. The formula for the arc length \(L\) is:

\[ L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r \]

Where:
- \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees.
- \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

From the problem, we know:
- The radius \(r = 2\) inches.
- The central angle \(\theta = 130^\circ - 112^\circ = 18^\circ\).

Now, substitute these values into the arc length formula:

\[ L = \frac{18^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 2 \]

Simplify the expression:

\[ L = \frac{18}{360} \times 4\pi \]
\[ L = \frac{1}{20} \times 4\pi \]
\[ L = \frac{4\pi}{20} \]
\[ L = \frac{\pi}{5} \]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):

\[ L \approx \frac{3.14159}{5} \]
\[ L \approx 0.628318 \]

Rounded to the nearest hundredth:

\[ L \approx 0.63 \]

However, this value does not match any of the given choices directly. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a different interpretation needed. But based on the choices provided, let's re-evaluate the problem with the given options.

Given the options:
- A: 2.27
- B: 3.91
- C: 4.54
- D: 7.82

The closest value to our calculated result (0.63) among the choices is not present. This indicates a potential error in the problem setup or the choices provided. Given the problem constraints, the closest reasonable option might be re-evaluated or the problem might need clarification.

But based on the problem as stated and the given choices, the closest reasonable answer would be:
