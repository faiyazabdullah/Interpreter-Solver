====================================================================================================
To determine how many solutions the equation \( x^3 - x^2 - x = -2 \) has, we need to analyze the graph of the function \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \).

1. **Examine the given points on the graph:**
   - The graph passes through the points (-1, -1), (0, 0), (1, -1), and (2, 2).

2. **Rewrite the target equation:**
   The equation we need to solve is \( x^3 - x^2 - x = -2 \).

3. **Transform the equation:**
   Add 2 to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x^3 - x^2 - x + 2 = 0
   \]

4. **Analyze the transformed function:**
   We need to find the number of times the function \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x + 2 \) intersects the x-axis.

5. **Check for intersections:**
   - At \( x = -1 \):
     \[
     (-1)^3 - (-1)^2 - (-1) + 2 = -1 - 1 + 1 + 2 = 1 \quad (\text{not zero})
     \]
   - At \( x = 0 \):
     \[
     0^3 - 0^2 - 0 + 2 = 2 \quad (\text{not zero})
     \]
   - At \( x = 1 \):
     \[
     1^3 - 1^2 - 1 + 2 = 1 - 1 - 1 + 2 = 1 \quad (\text{not zero})
     \]
   - At \( x = 2 \):
     \[
     2^3 - 2^2 - 2 + 2 = 8 - 4 - 2 + 2 = 4 \quad (\text{not zero})
     \]

6. **Estimate the behavior using the graph:**
   - The graph appears to cross the x-axis once between \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 0 \).
   - There seems to be no other intersection within the visible range of the graph.

7. **Conclusion:**
   Based on the graph and the analysis, the equation \( x^3 - x^2 - x + 2 = 0 \) has exactly one solution.
