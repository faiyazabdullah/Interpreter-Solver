QUESTION:
Mio bought a tablet and pays monthly for internet service for it. She graphed the relationship between the number of months she has had the tablet and the total amount she has spent on it. x-axis labels "Time (months)", and y-axis labels "Total cost (dollars)"
What does the y-intercept represent in this context?
Choose 1 answer:

CHOICES:
A:The number of months after which the total cost is 0 dollars.
B:The cost of buying the tablet
C:The cost per month of internet service
D:None of the above

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to understand the context of the graph provided. The x-axis represents the time in months, and the y-axis represents the total cost in dollars. The y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis. This intersection point gives us the value of y when x is 0.

In this context:
- The x-intercept would represent the number of months after which the total cost is 0 dollars.
- The y-intercept represents the total cost when the time is 0 months, which is the initial cost of the tablet before any monthly payments.
- The slope of the line represents the cost per month of the internet service.

Given these interpretations, the y-intercept in this graph represents the cost of buying the tablet.

Final Answer: B
