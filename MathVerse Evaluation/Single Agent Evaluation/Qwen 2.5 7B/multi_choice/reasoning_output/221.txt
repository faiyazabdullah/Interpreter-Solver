QUESTION:
In the triangle, there are two angles as 60 and 55 degrees. Find x. Round the side measure to the nearest tenth.

CHOICES:
A:69.0
B:69.8
C:76.4
D:77.2

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the value of \( x \) in the given triangle, we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

Given angles:
- One angle is 60 degrees.
- Another angle is 55 degrees.
- Let the third angle be \( x \).

Using the angle sum property of a triangle:

\[ 60^\circ + 55^\circ + x = 180^\circ \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 115^\circ + x = 180^\circ \]
\[ x = 180^\circ - 115^\circ \]
\[ x = 65^\circ \]

Now, we need to check the side length opposite to angle \( x \), which is 73 units. However, since the problem only asks for the value of \( x \), we can conclude:
