To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

Given:
- Central angle ∠AOB = 100°

The inscribed angle ∠ACB subtends the same arc AB as the central angle ∠AOB.

Therefore:
∠ACB = 1/2 * ∠AOB
∠ACB = 1/2 * 100°
∠ACB = 50°

However, since the inscribed angle ∠ACB is actually the angle at the circumference, we need to consider the supplementary angle because the inscribed angle and the angle formed by the tangent and the chord from the point where the tangent touches the circle are supplementary. But here, we just need to find the supplementary angle to the central angle which is 180° - 100° = 80°. But the correct interpretation here is considering the supplementary angle for the arc.

So, the inscribed angle ∠ACB is actually:
180° - (1/2 * 100°) = 180° - 50° = 130°
