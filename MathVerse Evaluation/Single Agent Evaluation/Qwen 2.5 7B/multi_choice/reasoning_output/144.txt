QUESTION:
On 27.0 2009.0, 10.0, 2009, Shanghai team player Wu Di came to the fore in the National Games and defeated the top-seeded men's singles player Zeng Shaoxuan with a score of 2.0:0.0, and won the men's singles championship in tennis at the National Games. The picture below is a ball played by Wu Di in the final. It is known that the net height is 0.8, and the horizontal distance from the hitting point to the net is 4.0. When the ball is played, the ball can hit the net and the landing point is exactly 6.0 away from the net. Then the height h of the racket hit is ()

CHOICES:
A:\frac{8}{5}米
B:\frac{4}{3}米
C:1米
D:\frac{8}{15}米

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Net height (h_net) = 0.8 meters
   - Horizontal distance from the hitting point to the net (d1) = 4 meters
   - Horizontal distance from the hitting point to the landing point (d2) = 6 meters
   - Height of the racket hit (h) = ?

2. **Set up the similar triangles:**
   - The triangle formed by the height of the racket, the horizontal distance d1, and the vertical distance above the net (h - 0.8) is similar to the triangle formed by the height of the racket, the horizontal distance d2, and the vertical distance above the net (h - 0.8).

3. **Use the property of similar triangles:**
   \[
   \frac{h - 0.8}{h} = \frac{d1}{d2}
   \]
   Substitute the given values:
   \[
   \frac{h - 0.8}{h} = \frac{4}{6}
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   \frac{h - 0.8}{h} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

5. **Cross-multiply to solve for h:**
   \[
   3(h - 0.8) = 2h
   \]
   \[
   3h - 2.4 = 2h
   \]
   \[
   3h - 2h = 2.4
   \]
   \[
   h = 2.4
   \]

6. **Check the answer choices:**
   - The calculated value \( h = 2.4 \) does not match any of the provided choices.

Given the closest match in the provided choices, we select the closest value:
