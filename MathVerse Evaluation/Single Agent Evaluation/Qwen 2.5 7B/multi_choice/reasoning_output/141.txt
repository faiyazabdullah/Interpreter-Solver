QUESTION:
While measuring the height of the building, Xiao Ming first measured the shadow length BA of the building on the ground as 15.0 (as shown in the figure), and then set up a benchmark with a height of 2.0 at A, and measured the shadow length AC of the benchmark as 3.0, then the height of the building is ()

CHOICES:
A:10米
B:12米
C:15米
D:22.5米

To solve the problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Identify the similar triangles:
   - Triangle \( \triangle CAB \) is similar to triangle \( \triangle ADB \) because they share angle \( \angle CBA \) and both have right angles at \( A \) and \( B \) respectively.
   
2. Set up the proportion based on the similarity:
   \[
   \frac{\text{height of building}}{\text{shadow of building}} = \frac{\text{height of benchmark}}{\text{shadow of benchmark}}
   \]
   This translates to:
   \[
   \frac{h}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

3. Solve for \( h \):
   \[
   h = 15 \times \frac{2}{3} = 10
   \]

Thus, the height of the building is 10 meters.
