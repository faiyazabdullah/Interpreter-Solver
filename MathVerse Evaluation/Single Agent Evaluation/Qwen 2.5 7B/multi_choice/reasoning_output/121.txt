QUESTION:
The production process of paper umbrellas in our country is very ingenious. As shown in the figure, whether the umbrella is opened or closed, the handle AP always bisects the angle angle BAC formed by the two ribs in the same plane, and AE = AF, DE = DF, so as to ensure that the umbrella ring can slide along the handle. When a toy umbrella is opened, the BDC is on the same straight line. If AB = 50.0, AD = 14.0, then the area of ​​oil paper required to make such a paper umbrella is (don't remember the seam) ()

CHOICES:
A:48cm^{2}
B:70πcm^{2}
C:2400πcm^{2}
D:2500πcm^{2}

To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the oil paper required for the umbrella when it is opened. Let's break down the solution step by step.

1. **Identify Key Information:**
   - \( AB = 50 \)
   - \( AD = 14 \)
   - The umbrella is opened such that \( BDC \) is on the same straight line.
   - \( AE = AF \)
   - \( DE = DF \)

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - Since \( AE = AF \) and \( DE = DF \), triangle \( ADE \) is congruent to triangle \( ADF \) by the Side-Side-Side (SSS) congruence criterion.
   - This implies \( \angle EAD = \angle FAD \) and \( \angle AED = \angle AFD \).

3. **Determine the Area:**
   - The area of the oil paper is essentially the area of sector \( BAD \) minus the area of triangle \( ADE \).
   - The radius of the circle is half of \( AB \) because \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \) and \( AD \) is the radius of the circle.
   - Therefore, the radius \( r \) is \( \frac{AB}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \).

4. **Calculate the Area of Sector \( BAD \):**
   - The central angle \( \theta \) of the sector is \( 2 \times 14 = 28^\circ \) because \( \angle EAD = \angle FAD = 14^\circ \).
   - The area of the sector is given by \( \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{28}{360} \times \pi \times 25^2 = \frac{7}{90} \times 625\pi = \frac{4375\pi}{90} = \frac{875\pi}{18} \).

5. **Calculate the Area of Triangle \( ADE \):**
   - Since \( AD = 14 \) and \( AE = AF \), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times base \times height \).
   - The height from \( D \) to \( EF \) is the same as the height from \( D \) to \( AB \) because \( D \) is the midpoint.
   - The area of the sector minus the area of the triangle gives the area of the oil paper.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - The area of the oil paper is approximately \( 70\pi \).

Therefore, the area of the oil paper required is:
