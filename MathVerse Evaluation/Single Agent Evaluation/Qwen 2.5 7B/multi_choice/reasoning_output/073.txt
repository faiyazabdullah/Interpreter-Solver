QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the property of inscribed angles and central angles in a circle. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information**: We know that angle ABC is 70 degrees.
2. **Understand the relationship between inscribed and central angles**: An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. In this case, angle AOC is a central angle subtending the same arc as inscribed angle ABC.
3. **Calculate the central angle**: Since angle AOC is a central angle and angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending the same arc, angle AOC will be twice the measure of angle ABC. Therefore, angle AOC = 2 * 70 = 140 degrees.

Thus, the degree of angle AOC is 140 degrees.

Final Answer: A
