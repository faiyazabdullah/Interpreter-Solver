QUESTION:
Simon has a certain length of fencing to enclose a rectangular area. The quadratic function A with a vertec of (10, 100) models the rectangle's area (in square meters) as a function of its width (in meters). It intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). Which of these statements are true?

CHOICES:
A:Greater width always relates to smaller area.
B:Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than $10 \mathrm{~m}$.
C:When there is no width, the area is $20 \mathrm{~m}^2$.
D:When there is no width, the area is $0 \mathrm{~m}^2$.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's analyze the graph and the given information:

1. The quadratic function \( A \) represents the area of the rectangle as a function of its width.
2. The vertex of the parabola is at \( (10, 100) \), indicating the maximum area occurs when the width is 10 meters.
3. The parabola intersects the x-axis at \( (0, 0) \) and \( (20, 0) \), meaning the total length of the fencing is 20 meters.
4. The area \( A \) is maximized at the vertex where the width is 10 meters.

Now, let's evaluate each statement:

A: Greater width always relates to smaller area.
   - This is false because the area is maximized at the vertex, which is at 10 meters width.

B: Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than \( 10 \text{ m} \).
   - This is also false because the area increases from 0 to 10 meters and then decreases.

C: When there is no width, the area is \( 20 \text{ m}^2 \).
   - This is false because when the width is 0, the area is 0, not 20.

D: When there is no width, the area is \( 0 \text{ m}^2 \).
   - This is true because when the width is 0, the rectangle collapses into a point, resulting in an area of 0.

Final Answer: D
