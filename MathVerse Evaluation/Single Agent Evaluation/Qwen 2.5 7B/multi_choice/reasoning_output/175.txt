QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, AC is the diameter of circle O, if angle OBC = 40.0, then the degree of angle AOB is ()

CHOICES:
A:40째
B:50째
C:80째
D:100째

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use some properties of circles and angles.

1. Since AC is the diameter of circle O, angle ABC is a right angle (90 degrees) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always 90 degrees.
2. We know angle OBC = 40 degrees.
3. In triangle OBC, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees. So, angle OCB = 180 - 90 - 40 = 50 degrees.
4. Since angle AOB is the central angle subtended by the same arc as angle AOB, it is twice the inscribed angle OCB. Therefore, angle AOB = 2 * 50 = 100 degrees.

Final Answer: D
