Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( CD = 7 \)
   - \( CF = 15 \)
   - \( CDEF \) is a rectangle.
   - The area of triangle \( CAF \) is equal to the area of rectangle \( CDEF \).

2. **Calculate the area of rectangle \( CDEF \):**
   - Since \( CDEF \) is a rectangle, its area is \( CD \times CF \).
   - Therefore, the area of \( CDEF \) is \( 7 \times 15 = 105 \).

3. **Set up the equation for the area of triangle \( CAF \):**
   - The area of triangle \( CAF \) can be calculated using the base \( CF \) and height \( AD \).
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
   - Here, the base \( CF = 15 \) and the height is \( AD \).
   - Therefore, the area of triangle \( CAF \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times AD \).

4. **Set the area of triangle \( CAF \) equal to the area of rectangle \( CDEF \):**
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times AD = 105
   \]

5. **Solve for \( AD \):**
   \[
   \frac{15}{2} \times AD = 105
   \]
   \[
   AD = \frac{105 \times 2}{15}
   \]
   \[
   AD = \frac{210}{15}
   \]
   \[
   AD = 14
   \]

6. **Compare the calculated result with the given answer choices:**
   - The calculated length of \( AD \) is 14.
   - The closest answer choice to 14 is 15/2 (which is approximately 7.5).

Given the options provided, the closest answer is:
