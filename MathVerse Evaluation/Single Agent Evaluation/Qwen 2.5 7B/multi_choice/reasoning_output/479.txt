QUESTION:
There is a curve that goes through (-3,0), (-2,1), and (-1,2). Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A:This is a one-to-one function
B:This is not a one-to-one function

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the relation represented by the curve is a one-to-one function, we need to check if each x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value and vice versa.

1. Examine the curve at the points (-3, 0), (-2, 1), and (-1, 2).
2. Notice that the curve appears to pass through these points without any repetition.
3. Check for any horizontal line crossing the curve more than once. If it does, the function is not one-to-one because it would violate the vertical line test (a vertical line intersects the graph more than once).

From the graph, it seems the curve does not cross any horizontal line more than once. Therefore, the relation appears to be one-to-one.

Final Answer: A
