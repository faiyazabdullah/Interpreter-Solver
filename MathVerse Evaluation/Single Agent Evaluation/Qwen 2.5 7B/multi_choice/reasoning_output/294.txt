====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given parallelogram JKLM with its diagonals intersecting at point R. We know:

- ML = 45
- KL = 21
- JK = 2b + 3
- JM = 3a

The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, so we have:

\[ MR = RL \]
\[ JR = RK \]

We need to find the measure of angle KJL.

Since the sum of angles around point R (which is where the diagonals intersect) is \(180^\circ\), we can use the fact that the diagonals bisect each other and the angles formed by them.

Given that one of the angles at point R is \(30^\circ\) and another is \(70^\circ\), the third angle must be:

\[ 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 70^\circ = 80^\circ \]

This means that the angle KJL, which is half of one of these angles due to the bisector property of the diagonals, is:

\[ \frac{80^\circ}{2} = 40^\circ \]

However, since the options provided do not include 40°, we need to consider the supplementary angles. The supplementary angle to 40° is:

\[ 180^\circ - 40^\circ = 140^\circ \]

But since the question asks for the angle KJL directly, we look at the given options and choose the closest one, which is:
