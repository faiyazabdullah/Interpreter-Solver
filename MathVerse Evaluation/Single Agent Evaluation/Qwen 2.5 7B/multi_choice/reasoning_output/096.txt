To solve this problem, we need to use the Inscribed Angle Theorem, which states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. Identify the given information: The central angle AOB measures 40 degrees.
2. According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of the inscribed angle APB, which subtends the same arc AB as the central angle AOB, is half the measure of the central angle AOB.
3. Calculate the measure of angle APB: 
   \[
   \text{Measure of } \angle APB = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } \angle AOB = \frac{1}{2} \times 40^\circ = 20^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the degree of angle APB is 20 degrees.
