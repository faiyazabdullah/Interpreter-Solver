QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, radial AE intersects CD at point F, if angle 1 = 115.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()

CHOICES:
A:55°
B:65°
C:75°
D:85°

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for angle 2, we need to use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.

1. Given: AB is parallel to CD.
2. Line AE intersects both AB and CD at points A and F respectively.
3. Angle 1 is given as 115°.

Since AB is parallel to CD, angle 1 and its corresponding alternate interior angle (angle AFE) are supplementary because they form a linear pair with another angle inside the transversal AE. 

Therefore, angle AFE = 180° - 115° = 65°.

Angle 2 is also an alternate interior angle with respect to the same transversal AE intersecting the parallel lines AB and CD. Thus, angle 2 will have the same measure as angle AFE.

So, angle 2 = 65°.

Final Answer: B
