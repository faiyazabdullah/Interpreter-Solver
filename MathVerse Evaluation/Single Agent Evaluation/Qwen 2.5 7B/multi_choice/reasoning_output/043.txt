QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. We know that triangle ODC is obtained by rotating triangle OAB clockwise around point O by 30 degrees.
2. Since the rotation is 30 degrees, angle AOB is 30 degrees.
3. Angle AOC is given as 100 degrees.
4. Therefore, angle BOC can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{angle BOC} = \text{angle AOC} - \text{angle AOB} = 100^\circ - 30^\circ = 70^\circ
   \]
5. Now, we need to find angle DOB. Since point D falls on AB and the rotation is 30 degrees, angle DOB will be half of angle BOC because D lies on AB which is the axis of rotation.
6. Thus,
   \[
   \text{angle DOB} = \frac{\text{angle BOC}}{2} = \frac{70^\circ}{2} = 35^\circ
   \]

However, the closest value among the given choices is 38 degrees.
