QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to estimate the width of the Jing River, a target point P is selected on the opposite bank of the Jing River, and points Q and S are taken near the bank, so that the points P, Q, and S are in a straight line, and the straight line PS is perpendicular to the river. Choose an appropriate point T on the straight line a passing point S and perpendicular to PS. The intersection of PT and the straight line b passing point Q and perpendicular to PS is R. If QS = 60.0, ST = 120.0, QR = 80.0, then the width of the river PQ is ()

CHOICES:
A:40m
B:120m
C:60m
D:180m

To solve this problem, we need to use similar triangles and proportions.

1. Identify the similar triangles:
   - Triangle PQR is similar to triangle PST because both have right angles (at R and S) and share angle P.
   - Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal: \(\frac{PQ}{PS} = \frac{QR}{ST}\).

2. Substitute the given values into the proportion:
   - \(PQ\) is the width of the river we want to find.
   - \(PS = PQ + QS\).
   - \(PS = PQ + 60\).
   - \(ST = 120\).
   - \(QR = 80\).

3. Set up the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{PQ}{PQ + 60} = \frac{80}{120}
   \]

4. Simplify the fraction on the right side:
   \[
   \frac{80}{120} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

5. Substitute back into the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{PQ}{PQ + 60} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]

6. Cross-multiply to solve for \(PQ\):
   \[
   3PQ = 2(PQ + 60)
   \]
   \[
   3PQ = 2PQ + 120
   \]
   \[
   PQ = 120
   \]

Therefore, the width of the river \(PQ\) is 120 meters.
