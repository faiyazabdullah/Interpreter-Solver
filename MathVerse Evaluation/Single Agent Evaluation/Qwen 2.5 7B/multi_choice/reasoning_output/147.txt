QUESTION:
In order to measure the height of the school flagpole AC, a school math interest group erected a benchmark DF with a length of 1.5 at point F. As shown in the figure, the length of the shadow EF of DF is measured as 1.0, and then measure the length of the shadow BC of the flagpole AC to be 6.0, then the height of the flagpole AC is ()

CHOICES:
A:6米
B:7米
C:8.5米
D:9米

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the similar triangles**: In the given problem, triangle DEF is similar to triangle ABC because they both have right angles (at F and C) and the angle at D is equal to the angle at A (since they are both subtended by the same parallel lines).

2. **Set up the proportion**: Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \frac{DF}{EF} = \frac{AC}{BC}
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{1.0} = \frac{AC}{6.0}
   \]

3. **Solve for AC**: Simplify the left side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1.5}{1.0} = 1.5
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   1.5 = \frac{AC}{6.0}
   \]
   To find AC, multiply both sides by 6.0:
   \[
   AC = 1.5 \times 6.0 = 9.0
   \]

Therefore, the height of the flagpole AC is 9 meters.

Final Answer: D
