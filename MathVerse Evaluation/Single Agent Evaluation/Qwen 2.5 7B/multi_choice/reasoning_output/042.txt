QUESTION:
The figure is a schematic diagram of a kite stand made by Xiao Liu. It is known that BC parallel PQ, AB:AP = 2.0:5.0, AQ = 20.0, then the length of CQ is ()

CHOICES:
A:8cm
B:12cm
C:30cm
D:50cm

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. Since BC is parallel to PQ, triangle ABC is similar to triangle APQ by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

Given:
- AB:AP = 2:5
- AQ = 20 cm

We need to find the length of CQ.

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{AB}{AP} = \frac{AC}{AQ}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{2}{5} = \frac{AC}{20}
\]

Let \( AC = x \). Then:

\[
\frac{2}{5} = \frac{x}{20}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8
\]

So, \( AC = 8 \).

Now, since \( AQ = 20 \) and \( AC = 8 \), we can find \( CQ \) as follows:

\[
CQ = AQ - AC = 20 - 8 = 12
\]

Thus, the length of \( CQ \) is 12 cm.
