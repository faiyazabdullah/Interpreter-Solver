QUESTION:
In the figure, there are four lines intersect at four points. Two pairs of lines are parallel to each other. m \angle 1 = 123. Find the measure of \angle 14.

CHOICES:
A:47
B:57
C:67
D:123

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and use geometric properties:

1. We know that two pairs of lines are parallel.
2. Angle 1 is given as 123°.
3. Angles 1 and 14 are corresponding angles because they are formed by the same transversal cutting two parallel lines.

Since corresponding angles are equal when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, angle 14 will have the same measure as angle 1.

Therefore, angle 14 measures 123°.

Final Answer: D
