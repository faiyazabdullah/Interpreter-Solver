QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, it is known that angle α = 130.0, then angle β = ()

CHOICES:
A:30°
B:40°
C:50°
D:65°

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given geometric configuration:

1. We know that angle α is 130 degrees.
2. Angle α and angle β form a straight line with another angle (let's call it γ) which is perpendicular to the horizontal line.

Since the sum of angles around a point is 180 degrees, we can express the relationship as follows:
\[ \alpha + \beta = 90^\circ \]

Given that α = 130 degrees, we need to find β:
\[ 130^\circ + \beta = 90^\circ \]
This equation is incorrect because it would imply that β is negative, which is not possible for an angle in standard geometric interpretation. Instead, we should consider the correct relationship where:
\[ \beta = 90^\circ - 130^\circ + 90^\circ = 40^\circ \]

Thus, angle β is 40 degrees.

Final Answer: B
