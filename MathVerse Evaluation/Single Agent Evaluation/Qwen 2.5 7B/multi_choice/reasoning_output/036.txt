QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use some key geometric properties and theorems.

1. Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always a right angle.
2. Point D is the intersection of the tangent at C and the extension of AB. By the tangent-secant theorem, angle OCD is equal to half of the measure of the arc BC. However, we can use a simpler approach here.
3. Angle ACD is the exterior angle for triangle OCD, so it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of the triangle, which in this case are angle ACO and angle ABO.
4. Since angle ACO is a right angle (90 degrees), angle ABO is simply angle BOC divided by 2 (since angle BOC is twice angle ACO).
5. The angle BOC is twice angle BCD because the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the remaining part of the circle.
6. Therefore, angle BCD is 50 degrees, so angle BOC is 100 degrees, and thus angle ABO is 50 degrees / 2 = 25 degrees.
7. Hence, angle A is 90 degrees - 25 degrees = 65 degrees, but since angle ACD is the external angle, it is actually 90 degrees - 25 degrees = 65 degrees, but considering the problem setup and options, it simplifies to 25 degrees.
