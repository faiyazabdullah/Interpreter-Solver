QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the darkened arc in the given geometric figure.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The circumference of the large circle is 36.
   - The radius \( r \) of the small circle is half the radius \( R \) of the large circle.
   - The central angle subtended by the darkened arc is 80Â°.

2. **Calculate the radius of the large circle:**
   \[
   \text{Circumference} = 2\pi R = 36
   \]
   \[
   R = \frac{36}{2\pi} = \frac{18}{\pi}
   \]

3. **Calculate the radius of the small circle:**
   \[
   r = \frac{R}{2} = \frac{\frac{18}{\pi}}{2} = \frac{9}{\pi}
   \]

4. **Determine the length of the darkened arc:**
   The formula for the length of an arc is:
   \[
   \text{Arc length} = \theta \times R
   \]
   where \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.

5. **Convert the central angle from degrees to radians:**
   \[
   80^\circ = 80 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{4\pi}{9}
   \]

6. **Calculate the arc length using the radius of the large circle:**
   \[
   \text{Arc length} = \left(\frac{4\pi}{9}\right) \times \frac{18}{\pi} = \left(\frac{4\pi}{9}\right) \times \frac{18}{\pi} = \frac{72}{9} = 8
   \]

Thus, the length of the darkened arc is 8.
