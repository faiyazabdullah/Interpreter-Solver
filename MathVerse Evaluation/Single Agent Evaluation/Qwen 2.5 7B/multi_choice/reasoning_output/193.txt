To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of tangents to a circle. Specifically, we know that tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length.

Given:
- \( PA \) and \( PB \) are tangents to the circle at points \( A \) and \( B \) respectively.
- The length of \( PA = 2.0 \).

Since \( PA \) and \( PB \) are tangents from the same external point \( P \) to the circle, we have:
\[ PA = PB = 2.0 \]

Next, consider the tangent \( EF \) which intersects the tangents \( PA \) and \( PB \) at points \( E \) and \( F \) respectively. According to the tangent-tangent theorem, the lengths of the tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal. Therefore:
\[ PE = PF \]

Now, let's find the perimeter of triangle \( PEF \):
\[ \text{Perimeter of } \triangle PEF = PE + EF + PF \]

Since \( PE = PF \), we can rewrite the perimeter as:
\[ \text{Perimeter of } \triangle PEF = PE + EF + PE = 2PE + EF \]

We need to determine the length of \( EF \). By the power of a point theorem, the product of the lengths of the segments of the tangent and the secant drawn from a point outside the circle are equal. Here, \( EF \) is a tangent segment and \( PA \) and \( PB \) are secants from point \( P \).

Using the power of a point theorem:
\[ PE \cdot PF = PA^2 \]
Since \( PE = PF \), we have:
\[ PE^2 = PA^2 \]
\[ PE^2 = 2^2 \]
\[ PE^2 = 4 \]
\[ PE = 2 \]

Thus:
\[ EF = PA - PE = 2 - 2 = 0 \] (This is incorrect; re-evaluate)

Re-evaluating:
\[ PE = PF = \sqrt{PA^2 - \left(\frac{EF}{2}\right)^2} \]
\[ PE = PF = \sqrt{4 - \left(\frac{EF}{2}\right)^2} \]
\[ PE = PF = 2 \]

Therefore:
\[ EF = PA - PE = 2 - 2 = 0 \] (Correct)

Thus:
\[ \text{Perimeter of } \triangle PEF = 2PE + EF = 2(2) + 2 = 6 \]
