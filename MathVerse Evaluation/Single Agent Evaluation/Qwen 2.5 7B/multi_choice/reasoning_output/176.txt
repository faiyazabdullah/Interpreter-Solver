To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and use the relevant geometric properties.

1. We are given a circle with center \( A \), and chords \( BC = 8 \) and \( DE = 6 \).
2. The angle \( \angle BAC + \angle EAD = 180^\circ \).

Since \( \angle BAC + \angle EAD = 180^\circ \), points \( B, A, D, C \) and \( D, A, E, C \) form cyclic quadrilaterals. This implies that \( \angle BAC \) and \( \angle EAD \) are supplementary angles.

Let's denote the radius of the circle as \( r \). The chords \( BC \) and \( DE \) can be related to the radius using the perpendicular distance from the center to the chords.

Using the formula for the length of a chord in a circle:
\[ BC = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - d_1^2} \]
\[ DE = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - d_2^2} \]

Where \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \) are the perpendicular distances from the center \( A \) to the chords \( BC \) and \( DE \) respectively.

Given:
\[ BC = 8 \]
\[ DE = 6 \]

We have two equations:
\[ 8 = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - d_1^2} \]
\[ 6 = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - d_2^2} \]

Solving for \( r \):
\[ 4 = \sqrt{r^2 - d_1^2} \]
\[ 9 = \sqrt{r^2 - d_2^2} \]

Square both sides:
\[ 16 = r^2 - d_1^2 \]
\[ 81 = r^2 - d_2^2 \]

From these equations, we can see that the difference between the squares of the radii and the distances should satisfy the given lengths of the chords. Since the problem does not provide the exact values of \( d_1 \) and \( d_2 \), we need to find a common radius that fits both conditions.

By solving these equations, we find that the radius \( r \) is 5.
