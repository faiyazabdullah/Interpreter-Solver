QUESTION:
Three lines l, m, and p intersect at two points and form eights angles. Line l and m are parallel. If m \angle 5 = 7 x - 5 and m \angle 4 = 2 x + 23, find x.

CHOICES:
A:5.6
B:18
C:20
D:22

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the property of corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines. Since lines \(l\) and \(m\) are parallel, corresponding angles are equal.

From the diagram, we can see that \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 5\) are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal \(p\) and between the parallel lines \(l\) and \(m\).

Given:
\[ m\angle 5 = 7x - 5 \]
\[ m\angle 4 = 2x + 23 \]

Since \(\angle 4\) and \(\angle 5\) are corresponding angles, they must be equal:
\[ 7x - 5 = 2x + 23 \]

Now, solve for \(x\):
1. Subtract \(2x\) from both sides:
   \[ 7x - 2x - 5 = 23 \]
   \[ 5x - 5 = 23 \]

2. Add 5 to both sides:
   \[ 5x = 28 \]

3. Divide by 5:
   \[ x = \frac{28}{5} \]
   \[ x = 5.6 \]

Therefore, the value of \(x\) is 5.6.
