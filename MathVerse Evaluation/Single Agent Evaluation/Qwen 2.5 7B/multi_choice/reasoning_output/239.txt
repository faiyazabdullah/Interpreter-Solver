To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of medians and the centroid of a triangle. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the Centroid**: The point \(M\) where the medians \(AT\), \(BR\), and \(CS\) intersect is the centroid of the triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

2. **Given Information**:
   - \(MC = 7\)
   - \(RM = 4\)
   - \(AT = 16\)

3. **Calculate \(AM\)**:
   Since \(M\) is the centroid, it divides \(AT\) in the ratio 2:1. Therefore, \(AM = \frac{2}{3} \times AT\).
   \[
   AM = \frac{2}{3} \times 16 = \frac{32}{3}
   \]

4. **Calculate \(MR\)**:
   Given \(RM = 4\), we can verify the consistency of the given values. Since \(M\) divides \(AT\) in the ratio 2:1, and \(AM = \frac{32}{3}\), it confirms the given \(RM = 4\).

5. **Calculate \(MB\)**:
   Since \(M\) is the centroid, \(M\) also divides \(BR\) in the ratio 2:1. We need to find \(MB\).
   \[
   MB = \frac{2}{3} \times BR
   \]
   To find \(BR\), note that \(R\) is the midpoint of \(AC\). Since \(MC = 7\) and \(RM = 4\), \(RC = MC + RM = 7 + 4 = 11\). Thus, \(AR = AC/2 = 11\).

6. **Using Similar Triangles**:
   Since \(M\) is the centroid, the segments created by the medians have consistent ratios. We can use the fact that \(MB = \frac{2}{3} \times BR\) and the known values to find \(MB\).
   \[
   MB = \frac{2}{3} \times BR
   \]
   Given the options and the consistent ratio, we can deduce:
   \[
   MB = 8
   \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:
