QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (0,1) and when the value of x increases the value of y increases, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the given function has an inverse, we need to check if it passes the horizontal line test. The horizontal line test states that if any horizontal line intersects the graph more than once, then the function does not have an inverse. 

In the provided image, the curve passes through the point (0, 1) and appears to be increasing as \( x \) increases. However, the curve is not strictly monotonic and appears to have a horizontal asymptote at \( y = 0 \). This means that for some values of \( y \), there are multiple corresponding \( x \)-values, indicating that the function fails the horizontal line test.

Therefore, the function does not have an inverse.

Final Answer: B
