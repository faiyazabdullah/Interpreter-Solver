QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the circle O is the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC, and the bisector of angle BAC and angle ABC intersects at point I. Extend AI and it intersects circle O at point D. Connect BD and DC. If the radius of circle O is 8.0, angle BAC = 120.0, then the length of DI is ()

CHOICES:
A:4√{3}+2
B:4√{3}+3
C:8√{3}+1
D:8√{3}

To solve for the length of DI, we need to use some geometric properties and theorems. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify Key Angles and Properties:**
   - Since ∠BAC = 120° and I is the incenter of triangle ABC, AI is the angle bisector of ∠BAC.
   - Therefore, ∠BAI = ∠CAI = 60°.
   - Since O is the circumcenter of triangle ABC, AO and BO are radii and thus equal in length. Also, ∠AOB = 2 * ∠ACB (since O is the center).

2. **Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - ∠BDC = ∠BAC = 120° because they subtend the same arc BC.

3. **Determine ∠ABD and ∠CBD:**
   - Since ∠ABD + ∠DBC = 120° and ∠ABD = ∠DBC (because AI is the angle bisector), each angle is 60°.
   - Thus, triangle BDI is equilateral with side length equal to the radius of the circumcircle, which is 8.

4. **Calculate DI:**
   - In an equilateral triangle with side length 8, the altitude (which is also the height) can be calculated as \(8 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 4\sqrt{3}\).
   - Therefore, DI = 8 + 4√3.
