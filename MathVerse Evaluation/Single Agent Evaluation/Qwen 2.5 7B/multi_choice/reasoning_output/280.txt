QUESTION:
There are two annotated angles of 5y and 60 degrees, and two annotated length x + 4 and 3 x - 6. Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

CHOICES:
A:3
B:5
C:12
D:18

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \) such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, we need to use the properties of parallelograms. Specifically, opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal in length.

Given:
- One side length is \( x + 4 \).
- The other side length is \( 3x - 6 \).

For the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, the following must hold true:
\[ x + 4 = 3x - 6 \]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Start with the equation:
   \[ x + 4 = 3x - 6 \]

2. Subtract \( x \) from both sides to isolate the terms involving \( x \):
   \[ 4 = 2x - 6 \]

3. Add 6 to both sides to further isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[ 10 = 2x \]

4. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[ x = 5 \]

Now, let's verify that \( x = 5 \) makes the quadrilateral a parallelogram. Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expressions for the side lengths:
\[ x + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 \]
\[ 3x - 6 = 3(5) - 6 = 15 - 6 = 9 \]

Since the side lengths are equal (\( 9 = 9 \)), the quadrilateral is indeed a parallelogram.

Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
