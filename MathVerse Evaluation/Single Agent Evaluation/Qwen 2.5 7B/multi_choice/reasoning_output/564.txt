To solve this problem, let's analyze the given functions and their characteristics:

1. **Function \( g(x) \):**
   - The graph of \( y = g(x) \) is a parabola that opens upwards.
   - The vertex of the parabola is at \( (-2, 3) \).
   - The parabola passes through the points \( (0, 7) \) and \( (-4, 7) \).

2. **Function \( f(x) \):**
   - The given function is \( f(x) = 4(x-5)^2 + 2 \).
   - This is also a parabola that opens upwards.
   - The vertex of the parabola is at \( (5, 2) \).

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

### Function \( g(x) \):
- The vertex form of the parabola is \( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex.
- Here, \( h = -2 \) and \( k = 3 \).
- The minimum value of \( g(x) \) occurs at the vertex \( (-2, 3) \).
- Therefore, the minimum value of \( g(x) \) is \( 3 \).

### Function \( f(x) \):
- The vertex form of the parabola is \( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex.
- Here, \( h = 5 \) and \( k = 2 \).
- The minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs at the vertex \( (5, 2) \).
- Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( 2 \).

**Comparison:**
- The minimum value of \( g(x) \) is \( 3 \).
- The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( 2 \).

Since \( 3 > 2 \), the function \( g(x) \) has a greater minimum.
