QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in the quadrilateral ABCD, E and F are the midpoints of AB and AD respectively. If EF = 2.0, BC = 5.0, CD = 3.0, then tanC is equal to ()

CHOICES:
A:\frac{3}{4}
B:\frac{4}{3}
C:\frac{3}{5}
D:\frac{4}{5}

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of midpoints and parallel lines in a quadrilateral.

Given:
- \(E\) and \(F\) are midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AD\) respectively.
- \(EF = 2.0\)
- \(BC = 5.0\)
- \(CD = 3.0\)

Since \(E\) and \(F\) are midpoints, \(EF\) is parallel to \(BD\) and half its length. This means:
\[ BD = 2 \times EF = 2 \times 2.0 = 4.0 \]

Next, we need to find the tangent of angle \(C\). To do this, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(BCD\).

First, let's place point \(D\) at \((0, 0)\) and point \(C\) at \((4, h)\) (since \(BD = 4\)).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(BCD\):
\[ BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 \]
\[ 5^2 = 4^2 + 3^2 \]
\[ 25 = 16 + 9 \]
\[ 25 = 25 \]

This confirms our coordinates. Now, we need to find the tangent of angle \(C\):
\[ \tan C = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{CD}{BD} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Thus, the value of \(\tan C\) is \(\frac{3}{4}\).
