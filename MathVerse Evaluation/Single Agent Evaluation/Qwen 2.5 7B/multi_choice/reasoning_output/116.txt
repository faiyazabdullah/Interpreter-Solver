QUESTION:
The picture shows a small paper cap with a conical chimney. The length of its generatrix l is 13.0 and its height h is 12.0. The area of ​​paper required to make this paper cap is (the seams are ignored) ()

CHOICES:
A:60π
B:65π
C:78π
D:156π

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the surface area of the conical paper cap. The formula for the lateral surface area \( A \) of a cone is given by:

\[ A = \pi r l \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone and \( l \) is the slant height (given as 13).

First, we need to find the radius \( r \). We can use the Pythagorean theorem since the height \( h \), the radius \( r \), and the slant height \( l \) form a right triangle:

\[ l^2 = r^2 + h^2 \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ 13^2 = r^2 + 12^2 \]
\[ 169 = r^2 + 144 \]
\[ r^2 = 169 - 144 \]
\[ r^2 = 25 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{25} \]
\[ r = 5 \]

Now, substitute \( r = 5 \) and \( l = 13 \) into the surface area formula:

\[ A = \pi \times 5 \times 13 \]
\[ A = 65\pi \]

Thus, the area of the paper required to make the paper cap is \( 65\pi \).
