QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use some basic properties of circles and angles.

1. Since AB is the diameter of the circle, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always a right angle.
2. Given that angle AOC = 126 degrees, we can find angle BOC by noting that the total angle around point O is 360 degrees. Therefore, angle BOC = 360 - 126 - 90 = 144 degrees.
3. Since angles subtended by the same arc in a circle are equal, angle CDB is half of angle BOC. Hence, angle CDB = 144 / 2 = 72 degrees.
4. However, we need to consider the reflex angle at point O, which is 360 - 126 = 234 degrees. The corresponding inscribed angle CDB will be half of this reflex angle, which is 234 / 2 = 117 degrees.
5. But since we need the smaller angle, we should take the supplementary angle of the inscribed angle, which is 180 - 117 = 63 degrees. But considering the options provided, it seems there might be a misinterpretation, and the correct approach is to consider the inscribed angle directly as half of the arc, which gives us 180 - 126/2 = 180 - 63 = 54 degrees.
