To solve this problem, let's break it down into manageable steps:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - The central angle of the sector is \(120^\circ\).
   - The radius of the sector is \(6\) cm.
   
2. **Understand the transformation**:
   - When the sector is formed into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
   
3. **Calculate the arc length of the sector**:
   - The formula for the arc length \(L\) of a sector with a central angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) and radius \(r\) is:
     \[
     L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 6 = \frac{1}{3} \times 12\pi = 4\pi \text{ cm}
     \]

4. **Relate the arc length to the circumference of the base of the cone**:
   - The circumference \(C\) of the base of the cone is equal to the arc length of the sector:
     \[
     C = 4\pi \text{ cm}
     \]
   - The formula for the circumference of a circle is:
     \[
     C = 2\pi r_{\text{base}}
     \]
   - Setting the two expressions for \(C\) equal:
     \[
     2\pi r_{\text{base}} = 4\pi
     \]
   - Solving for \(r_{\text{base}}\):
     \[
     r_{\text{base}} = \frac{4\pi}{2\pi} = 2 \text{ cm}
     \]

5. **Determine the diameter of the base of the cone**:
   - The diameter \(d\) of the base of the cone is twice the radius:
     \[
     d = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ cm}
     \]

Thus, the diameter of the base of the cone is \(4\) cm.
