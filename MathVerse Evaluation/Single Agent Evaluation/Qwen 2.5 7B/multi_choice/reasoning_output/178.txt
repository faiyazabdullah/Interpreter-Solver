QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, triangle ABC is the inscribed triangle of circle O, if angle ACB = 30.0, AB = 6.0, then the radius of circle O is ()

CHOICES:
A:3
B:2√{3}
C:6
D:4√{3}

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the radius of circle \(O\), we need to use the fact that triangle \(ABC\) is inscribed in the circle, and the measure of angle \(ACB\) is given as 30 degrees. This means that the central angle subtended by arc \(AB\) is twice the measure of the inscribed angle, so it is \(2 \times 30^\circ = 60^\circ\).

Since the central angle is 60 degrees and the triangle formed by the radii \(OA\) and \(OB\) and the chord \(AB\) is an equilateral triangle (because the central angle subtended by the chord \(AB\) is 60 degrees, making each of the other two angles 60 degrees too), the length of the chord \(AB\) is equal to the radius of the circle.

Given that \(AB = 6\), the radius \(r\) of the circle is also 6.

Therefore, the radius of circle \(O\) is:
