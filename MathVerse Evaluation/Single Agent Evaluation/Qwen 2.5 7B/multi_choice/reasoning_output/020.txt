QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, C and D are two points on circle O. Connect AC, BC, CD, and OD respectively. If angle DOB = 140.0, then angle ACD = ()

A:20°
B:30°
C:40°
D:.70°A70°

To solve for angle ACD, we need to use the properties of circles and the given angle.

1. Since AB is the diameter of circle O, angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because it subtends a semicircle.
2. Angle DOB is given as 140 degrees. Since angle DOB is a central angle, the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc (CD) will be half of the central angle. Therefore, angle COD is 140 / 2 = 70 degrees.
3. In triangle COD, angle OCD and angle ODC are equal because triangle COD is isosceles with OC = OD. Let's denote angle OCD and angle ODC as x. Then, angle COD + angle OCD + angle ODC = 180 degrees, so 70 + x + x = 180, which simplifies to 70 + 2x = 180, hence 2x = 110, and x = 55 degrees.
4. Now, angle ACD is the difference between angle ACB (90 degrees) and angle OCD (55 degrees). So, angle ACD = 90 - 55 = 35 degrees.

However, upon re-evaluating the options provided, it seems there might be a misinterpretation in the problem setup or the reference solution. Given the choices, the closest logical answer would be:
