QUESTION:
In the figure above, the circle has center P and radius r. Lines AB and AC are tangent to the circle. If M is the midpoint of segment AC and the measure of angle PMC equals the measure of angle MPC, what is the length, in terms of r, of segment PA?

CHOICES:
A.r + 1
B.2*r
C.r*\sqrt{2}
D.r*\sqrt{3}
E.r*\sqrt{5}

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use some geometric properties and relationships.

1. Since AB and AC are tangents to the circle from the same external point A, and both touch the circle at points B and C respectively, we know that the radii PB and PC are perpendicular to the tangents AB and AC.
2. This means that triangles ABP and ACP are right triangles.
3. Given that M is the midpoint of segment AC, and PM bisects angle APC, triangle AMC is isosceles with AM = MC.
4. Since PM is the angle bisector of angle APC, it also acts as the median to side AC. Therefore, PM is perpendicular to AC, making triangle APM a right triangle.
5. In triangle APM, since PM is the perpendicular bisector of AC and M is the midpoint of AC, we can infer that triangle APM is a right triangle with PM as the altitude.
6. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle APM, where AP is the hypotenuse, PM is one leg, and AM is the other leg (which is equal to MC):
   \[
   AP^2 = PM^2 + AM^2
   \]
   Since PM = r and AM = MC = √2r (because triangle AMC is isosceles and right-angled), we get:
   \[
   AP^2 = r^2 + (√2r)^2 = r^2 + 2r^2 = 3r^2
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   AP = √3r
   \]
