QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, a cylinder with a bottom circumference of 24.0 and a height of 5.0, the shortest route that an ant passes along the surface from point A to point B is ()

CHOICES:
A:12m
B:15m
C:13m
D:14m

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the shortest path from point \( A \) to point \( B \) on the surface of the cylinder, we can unroll the cylinder into a rectangle. The height of the cylinder becomes one side of the rectangle, and the circumference of the base becomes the other side.

Given:
- Height (\( h \)) = 5.0
- Circumference of the base (\( C \)) = 24.0

When unrolled, the cylinder forms a rectangle with dimensions:
- Length (\( L \)) = 5.0 (height)
- Width (\( W \)) = 24.0 (circumference)

The shortest path on the surface of the cylinder corresponds to the straight-line distance on this rectangle between points \( A \) and \( B \). This distance is the hypotenuse of a right triangle where the legs are the height and the width of the rectangle.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{L^2 + W^2} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ d = \sqrt{5.0^2 + 24.0^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{25 + 576} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{601} \]

Now calculate the approximate value:
\[ d \approx \sqrt{601} \approx 24.52 \]

However, we need to check which of the provided answer choices is closest to this value. The closest option is:
