QUESTION:
In the figure above, the smaller circles each have radius 3. They are tangent to the larger circle at points A and C, and are tangent to each other at point B, which is the center of the larger circle. What is the perimeter of the shaded region?

A.6*\pi
B.8*\pi
C.9*\pi
D.12*\pi
E.15*\pi

To solve this problem, we need to find the perimeter of the shaded region in the given figure.

1. **Examine the Figure:**
   - There is a large circle with a radius \( R \).
   - Two smaller circles with radius 3 each are tangent to the large circle at points \( A \) and \( C \).
   - The two smaller circles are also tangent to each other at point \( B \), which is the center of the large circle.

2. **Identify Key Points:**
   - Since the smaller circles are tangent to each other at point \( B \), the distance between their centers (which is \( 3 + 3 = 6 \)) is equal to the diameter of one of the smaller circles.
   - The distance from the center of the large circle \( B \) to the points \( A \) and \( C \) is the radius of the large circle minus the radius of the smaller circle, which is \( R - 3 \).

3. **Calculate the Radius of the Large Circle:**
   - Since the smaller circles are tangent to the large circle at points \( A \) and \( C \), the distance from the center of the large circle \( B \) to these points is \( R - 3 \).
   - The total distance from \( A \) to \( C \) along the circumference of the large circle is the arc length subtended by the central angle formed by the radii \( BA \) and \( BC \), which is \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) radians (since the smaller circles form a 60-degree angle at the center of the large circle).

4. **Perimeter Calculation:**
   - The perimeter of the shaded region consists of two arcs from the large circle and the diameters of the smaller circles.
   - The length of each arc is \( \frac{\pi}{3} R \).
   - The total arc length is \( 2 \times \frac{\pi}{3} R = \frac{2\pi R}{3} \).
   - The total length of the diameters of the smaller circles is \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \).

5. **Total Perimeter:**
   - The total perimeter of the shaded region is \( \frac{2\pi R}{3} + 6 \).

Since the problem does not provide the exact value of \( R \), we need to consider the possible choices. Given the options, we can infer that \( R \) is likely to be 9 (since \( \frac{2\pi \times 9}{3} = 6\pi \) and adding 6 gives us \( 6\pi + 6 \approx 12\pi \)).

Thus, the closest option is:
