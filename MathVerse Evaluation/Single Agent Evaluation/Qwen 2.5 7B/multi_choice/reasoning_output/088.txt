To solve this problem, we need to use some geometric properties involving circles and angles.

Given:
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circle with center \( O \).
- \( \angle ABO = 22^\circ \)
- \( \angle ACO = 42^\circ \)

We need to find \( \angle BOC \).

First, observe that \( \angle ABO \) and \( \angle ACO \) are inscribed angles subtending arcs \( AC \) and \( AB \) respectively.

Since \( \angle ABO \) and \( \angle ACO \) are inscribed angles, they are half the measure of their respective central angles subtending the same arcs.

Let's denote the central angle \( \angle BOC \) as \( \theta \).

The arc \( BC \) can be split into two arcs:
- Arc \( AC \) subtends \( \angle ACO \)
- Arc \( AB \) subtends \( \angle ABO \)

Since \( \angle ACO = 42^\circ \), the central angle \( \angle BOC \) corresponding to arc \( AC \) is twice \( \angle ACO \):
\[ \angle BOC = 2 \times 42^\circ = 84^\circ \]

Similarly, since \( \angle ABO = 22^\circ \), the central angle \( \angle BOC \) corresponding to arc \( AB \) is twice \( \angle ABO \):
\[ \angle BOC = 2 \times 22^\circ = 44^\circ \]

However, these two calculations are not consistent because they should add up to the total central angle around point \( O \). Instead, we need to consider the sum of the arcs subtended by \( \angle ACO \) and \( \angle ABO \).

The correct approach is to use the fact that the sum of the central angles subtending arcs \( AC \) and \( AB \) is equal to the central angle \( \angle BOC \).

Since \( \angle ABO \) and \( \angle ACO \) are supplementary to each other in terms of the central angles, we can use the fact that the sum of the central angles around point \( O \) is \( 360^\circ \).

Thus, the correct calculation for \( \angle BOC \) is:
\[ \angle BOC = 360^\circ - 2 \times (42^\circ + 22^\circ) = 360^\circ - 128^\circ = 232^\circ \]

However, this is not among the answer choices. Revisiting the problem, we see that the correct interpretation should be:
\[ \angle BOC = 360^\circ - 2 \times 42^\circ = 232^\circ \]
but the closest option is:
\[ \angle BOC = 128^\circ \]
