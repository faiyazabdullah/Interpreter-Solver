To solve for \( \angle CAM \), we need to analyze the given information:

1. There is a circle with center \( M \) and two chords \( AC \) and \( TN \).
2. The distances from \( M \) to both chords \( AC \) and \( TN \) are equal.
3. We need to find \( m\angle CAM \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Properties**:
   - Since the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to a chord is the shortest distance to that chord, the perpendiculars from \( M \) to \( AC \) and \( TN \) are radii of the circle.
   - This means \( MC \perp AC \) and \( MT \perp TN \).

2. **Angle Relationships**:
   - Given \( MT = 28^\circ \), this angle is formed at the center \( M \) between the radii \( MT \) and \( MN \).
   - Since \( M \) is the center, \( \angle AMT \) and \( \angle CMN \) are subtended by arcs \( AT \) and \( CN \) respectively, which are symmetric about \( M \).

3. **Symmetry and Equal Chords**:
   - Because \( MC \perp AC \) and \( MT \perp TN \), the chords \( AC \) and \( TN \) are symmetric about the diameter passing through \( M \).
   - Therefore, \( \angle CAM = \angle MAN \).

4. **Central Angle and Inscribed Angle**:
   - The central angle \( \angle AMT = 28^\circ \).
   - The inscribed angle \( \angle CAM \) is half of the central angle because the inscribed angle subtends the same arc as the central angle.
   - Thus, \( \angle CAM = \frac{1}{2} \times 28^\circ = 14^\circ \).

### Conclusion:
The measure of \( \angle CAM \) is \( 14^\circ \).
