To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the cone formed by the sector of a circle with a central angle of 120 degrees and a radius of 6 units.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the arc length of the sector:**
   - The formula for the arc length \(L\) of a sector with a central angle \(\theta\) (in degrees) and radius \(r\) is:
     \[
     L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
     \]
   - Substituting the given values (\(\theta = 120^\circ\), \(r = 6\)):
     \[
     L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 6 = \frac{1}{3} \times 12\pi = 4\pi
     \]

2. **Relate the arc length to the circumference of the base of the cone:**
   - The arc length \(4\pi\) becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
   - Let \(d\) be the diameter of the base of the cone.
   - The circumference of the base of the cone is given by:
     \[
     \pi d = 4\pi
     \]
   - Solving for \(d\):
     \[
     d = 4
     \]
   - Therefore, the radius \(r_{\text{base}}\) of the base of the cone is:
     \[
     r_{\text{base}} = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
     \]

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the cone:**
   - In the right triangle formed by the height \(h\) of the cone, the radius \(r_{\text{base}} = 2\), and the slant height (which is the radius of the original sector, 6 units), we have:
     \[
     h^2 + r_{\text{base}}^2 = \text{slant height}^2
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     h^2 + 2^2 = 6^2
     \]
     \[
     h^2 + 4 = 36
     \]
     \[
     h^2 = 32
     \]
     \[
     h = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
     \]

Thus, the height of the cone is \(4\sqrt{2}\).
