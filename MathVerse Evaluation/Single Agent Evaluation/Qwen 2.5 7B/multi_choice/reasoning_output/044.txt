QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the two street lamps A and B are separated by 30.0. One night, when Xiaogang went straight 25.0 from the bottom of street lamp A to the bottom of street lamp B, he found that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of street lamp B. It is known that Xiaogang's height is 1.5, then the height of the street lamp is ()

CHOICES:
A:9米
B:8米
C:7米
D:6米

To solve this problem, we can use similar triangles. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the two similar triangles:
   - Triangle formed by street lamp A, Xiaogang, and the ground.
   - Triangle formed by street lamp B, Xiaogang, and the ground.

2. Let the height of street lamp A be \( h_A \) and the height of street lamp B be \( h_B \).

3. The distance between the bases of the two street lamps is 30 meters.
   - Xiaogang walks 25 meters from the base of street lamp A to the base of street lamp B.

4. When Xiaogang walks 25 meters, the top of his head touches the ground at the base of street lamp B. This means the vertical distance between the top of street lamp A and the top of street lamp B is the same as Xiaogang's height, which is 1.5 meters.

5. Using similar triangles, we can set up the proportion:
   \[
   \frac{h_A}{h_B} = \frac{25 + 30}{25}
   \]

6. Simplify the right side of the equation:
   \[
   \frac{h_A}{h_B} = \frac{55}{25} = \frac{11}{5}
   \]

7. We also know that the difference in heights between the tops of the street lamps is 1.5 meters:
   \[
   h_A - h_B = 1.5
   \]

8. Substitute \( h_A = \frac{11}{5} h_B \) into the equation \( h_A - h_B = 1.5 \):
   \[
   \frac{11}{5} h_B - h_B = 1.5
   \]
   \[
   \left( \frac{11}{5} - 1 \right) h_B = 1.5
   \]
   \[
   \left( \frac{11}{5} - \frac{5}{5} \right) h_B = 1.5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{6}{5} h_B = 1.5
   \]
   \[
   h_B = 1.5 \times \frac{5}{6} = 1.25
   \]

9. Now, calculate \( h_A \):
   \[
   h_A = \frac{11}{5} \times 1.25 = 2.75
   \]

Therefore, the height of the street lamp is 2.75 meters plus the height of Xiaogang (1.5 meters), giving us a total height of 4.25 meters for the street lamp.

Since none of the provided choices match 4.25 meters, we need to re-evaluate the options given.
