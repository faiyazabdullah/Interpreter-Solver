QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (-1,0), (0,8), (2,0), (4,0), have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the function has an inverse, we need to check if it is one-to-one, meaning each x-value corresponds to exactly one y-value and vice versa. A function has an inverse if and only if it is strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) over its domain.

From the graph:

1. The function crosses the x-axis at x = -1, 0, 2, and 4.
2. It appears to have a local maximum around x = 0 and a local minimum around x = 2.
3. The function changes direction at these points, indicating it is not strictly monotonic.

Since the function is not strictly monotonic, it does not have an inverse.

Final Answer: B
