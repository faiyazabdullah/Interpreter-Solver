To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. Here's the detailed solution:

1. **Identify Similar Triangles**:
   - Triangle ABE and triangle CDE are similar because they share the same angle at E and both have right angles at B and D respectively (ABE and CDE are right triangles).

2. **Set Up the Proportion**:
   - Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Therefore, we can write the proportion:
     \[
     \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BE}{ED}
     \]
   - Given \( AB = 6 \) and \( CD = 3 \), we substitute these values into the proportion:
     \[
     \frac{6}{3} = \frac{BE}{ED}
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
     \[
     2 = \frac{BE}{ED}
     \]
   - This means \( BE = 2 \cdot ED \).

3. **Use the Total Length BD**:
   - The total length of BD is the sum of BE and ED. Since BE + ED = BD, and we know \( BE = 2 \cdot ED \), we can substitute and solve for ED:
     \[
     BE + ED = BD \implies 2 \cdot ED + ED = BD \implies 3 \cdot ED = BD
     \]
   - Solving for ED:
     \[
     ED = \frac{BD}{3}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Length of EF**:
   - EF is the height from E to the ground. Since E is on the line segment AD, and we need to find EF, we use the fact that EF is proportional to the heights of the triangles.
   - Using the similarity ratio:
     \[
     \frac{EF}{3} = \frac{6 - EF}{6}
     \]
   - Cross-multiplying to solve for EF:
     \[
     6 \cdot EF = 3 \cdot (6 - EF)
     \]
     \[
     6 \cdot EF = 18 - 3 \cdot EF
     \]
     \[
     9 \cdot EF = 18
     \]
     \[
     EF = \frac{18}{9} = 2
     \]

Thus, the length of the distance from E to the ground EF is 2.
