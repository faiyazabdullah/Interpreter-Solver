To solve the problem, let's analyze the given angles and their relationships:

1. Angles 1 and 2 are both 100 degrees. Since they are alternate interior angles formed by the transversal intersecting lines \(a\) and \(b\), lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel.
2. Angle 3 is 125 degrees. This angle is an exterior angle to the transversal intersecting lines \(a\) and \(c\). Because lines \(a\) and \(c\) are parallel (since lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel and a transversal intersects them), angle 3 is supplementary to the corresponding interior angle on line \(c\).
3. The corresponding interior angle on line \(c\) would be \(180^\circ - 125^\circ = 55^\circ\).
4. Since lines \(a\) and \(c\) are parallel, the alternate interior angle to this 55-degree angle on line \(d\) will also be 55 degrees (as it is alternate to angle 4).

Therefore, angle 4 is 55 degrees.

Final Answer: D
