To find the measure of angle BOC, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles around point O is 360 degrees. However, a more straightforward approach involves using the inscribed angle theorem and the central angle theorem.

Step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the given angles**:
   - Angle ABO = 40 degrees
   - Angle ACO = 30 degrees

2. **Understand the relationship between inscribed and central angles**:
   - An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - Here, angle ABO and angle ACO are inscribed angles subtending arcs AB and AC respectively.

3. **Calculate the measures of arcs**:
   - Arc AB = 2 * angle ABO = 2 * 40 = 80 degrees
   - Arc AC = 2 * angle ACO = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees

4. **Find the measure of arc BC**:
   - Since the total measure of the circle is 360 degrees, we subtract the measures of arcs AB and AC from 360 degrees:
     \[
     \text{Arc BC} = 360 - (80 + 60) = 220 \text{ degrees}
     \]

5. **Use the central angle theorem**:
   - The central angle BOC subtends the arc BC.
   - Therefore, angle BOC = measure of arc BC = 220 degrees.

However, the problem asks for the measure of angle BOC in terms of the given angles' context, which implies we need to consider the sum of the angles around point O and the inscribed angles' properties.

Given the options provided, let's re-evaluate the context:

- The correct interpretation should be the sum of the angles around point O considering the given angles' context.

By re-evaluating the problem with the given choices, the correct answer is:
