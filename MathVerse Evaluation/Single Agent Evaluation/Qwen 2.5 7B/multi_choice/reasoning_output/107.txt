QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
1. Given that \(AB\) is the diameter of circle \(O\), we know that \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is a right angle.
2. We are also given that \(\angle BOD = 130^\circ\). Since \(O\) is the center of the circle, \(\angle BOD\) is a central angle.
3. The measure of the inscribed angle \(\angle BAC\) that subtends the same arc as the central angle \(\angle BOD\) is half of the central angle. Therefore, \(\angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \times 130^\circ = 65^\circ\).
4. Now, in \(\triangle ACD\), we need to find the measure of \(\angle ACD\). Since \(\angle ACB = 90^\circ\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ - \angle BAC = 90^\circ - 65^\circ = 25^\circ\).

Thus, the degree of angle \(ACD\) is \(25^\circ\).
