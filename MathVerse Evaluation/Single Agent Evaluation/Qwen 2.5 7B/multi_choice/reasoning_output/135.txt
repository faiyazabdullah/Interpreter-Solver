Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. We know that \( \angle AOB = 140^\circ \).
2. Since \( M \) is the midpoint of arc \( AB \), \( OM \) bisects \( \angle AOB \). Therefore, \( \angle AOM = \angle MOB = \frac{140^\circ}{2} = 70^\circ \).

3. In circle \( O \), \( ON \) is a radius and passes through \( M \), which means \( OM \) is also a radius. Thus, \( OM = ON \).

4. Now, consider triangle \( OBN \). Since \( OM \) is a radius and \( ON \) is also a radius, \( \triangle OBN \) is isosceles with \( OB = ON \).

5. The angle \( \angle ONB \) can be found using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). In \( \triangle OBN \), we have:
   \[
   \angle OBN + \angle BON + \angle ONB = 180^\circ
   \]
   Since \( \angle BON = \angle AOB = 140^\circ \) (as \( ON \) is a continuation of \( OM \) through the center),
   \[
   \angle OBN + 140^\circ + \angle ONB = 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying,
   \[
   \angle OBN + \angle ONB = 40^\circ
   \]

6. Because \( \triangle OBN \) is isosceles with \( OB = ON \), \( \angle OBN = \angle ONB \). Therefore,
   \[
   2 \cdot \angle OBN = 40^\circ
   \]
   Hence,
   \[
   \angle OBN = \frac{40^\circ}{2} = 20^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the measure of \( \angle N \) is \( 20^\circ \).
