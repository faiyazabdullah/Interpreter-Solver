QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What does the average rate of change tell you?

CHOICES:
A:The number of earthquakes per year increased by 6 each year.
B:The number of earthquakes per year did not change.
C:There were a total of 6 earthquakes over the 4 years.
D:The number of earthquakes per year decreased by 6 each year.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the average rate of change, we need to calculate the change in the number of earthquakes over the change in time.

From the graph:
- In year 1, there are 6 earthquakes.
- In year 4, there are still 6 earthquakes.

The change in the number of earthquakes is \( 6 - 6 = 0 \).
The change in time is \( 4 - 1 = 3 \) years.

The average rate of change is \( \frac{0}{3} = 0 \).

This means the number of earthquakes per year did not change.
