====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(ABCE\) is a square with an area of 1.
   - \(CDE\) is an equilateral triangle.

2. **Calculate the side length of the square:**
   - The area of the square \(ABCE\) is 1.
   - Since the area of a square is given by \( \text{side}^2 \), we have:
     \[
     \text{side}^2 = 1 \implies \text{side} = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, each side of the square \(ABCE\) is 1 unit long.

3. **Determine the side length of the equilateral triangle \(CDE\):**
   - Since \(CDE\) is an equilateral triangle, all its sides are equal.
   - Let the side length of the equilateral triangle \(CDE\) be \(x\).

4. **Relate the side length of the equilateral triangle to the square:**
   - In the square \(ABCE\), point \(C\) is a vertex of both the square and the equilateral triangle.
   - Point \(D\) lies on the extension of one side of the square, and point \(E\) lies on the adjacent side of the square.
   - Since \(CDE\) is an equilateral triangle, \(CD = CE = DE = x\).

5. **Determine the total perimeter of polygon \(ABCDE\):**
   - The perimeter of polygon \(ABCDE\) is the sum of the lengths of its sides.
   - The sides are \(AB\), \(BC\), \(CD\), \(DE\), and \(EA\).
   - We know:
     \[
     AB = BC = 1 \quad (\text{since } ABCE \text{ is a square})
     \]
     \[
     CD = CE = DE = x \quad (\text{since } CDE \text{ is an equilateral triangle})
     \]
   - The perimeter is:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = AB + BC + CD + DE + EA = 1 + 1 + x + x + 1 = 3 + 2x
     \]

6. **Use the fact that \(CD = CE = DE\):**
   - Since \(CD = CE = DE\), and these segments form part of the equilateral triangle, we need to find the relationship between \(x\) and the square's side length.
   - The distance from \(C\) to \(E\) (which is the side of the square plus the side of the equilateral triangle) is also the same as the side of the equilateral triangle.

7. **Calculate the side length \(x\):**
   - The distance \(CE\) is the sum of the side of the square and the side of the equilateral triangle:
     \[
     CE = 1 + x
     \]
   - Since \(CE\) is also the side of the equilateral triangle:
     \[
     1 + x = x
     \]
   - Solving for \(x\):
     \[
     1 + x = x \implies x = 2
     \]

8. **Calculate the perimeter again:**
   - Substitute \(x = 2\) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 3 + 2x = 3 + 2(2) = 3 + 4 = 7
     \]

Therefore, the perimeter of polygon \(ABCDE\) is \(7\).
