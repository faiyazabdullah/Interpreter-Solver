Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Key Relationships**:
   - \( AH \) is perpendicular to \( BC \), so \( AH \) is the height from vertex \( A \) to side \( BC \).
   - The coordinates of point \( H \) divide \( BC \) into segments \( BG \) and \( GC \).

2. **Determine Coordinates**:
   - Given \( BC = 12 \) and \( AH = 8 \), we can use similar triangles to find the ratio of the smaller triangles formed.
   - Since \( DEFG \) is a square inscribed in the larger triangle, let's denote the side length of the square as \( s \).

3. **Similar Triangles**:
   - Since \( DE \parallel BC \), triangles \( ADE \) and \( ABC \) are similar.
   - The ratio of the sides of these triangles will help us find \( s \).

4. **Calculate the Ratio**:
   - Let \( M \) be the intersection of \( AH \) and \( DE \). Since \( DE \) is parallel to \( BC \), \( \triangle ADM \sim \triangle ABC \).
   - The height \( AH \) is divided into two segments: \( AM \) and \( MH \). Since \( DE \parallel BC \), \( AM:AH = DM:DH = DE:BC \).

5. **Set Up the Proportion**:
   - \( AM = 8 - s \)
   - \( AH = 8 \)
   - The ratio of the sides of the smaller triangle to the larger triangle is \( \frac{AM}{AH} = \frac{s}{12} \).

6. **Solve for \( s \)**:
   - From the similarity, \( \frac{8-s}{8} = \frac{s}{12} \).
   - Cross-multiplying gives \( 12(8 - s) = 8s \).
   - Simplifying, \( 96 - 12s = 8s \).
   - Combining like terms, \( 96 = 20s \).
   - Solving for \( s \), \( s = \frac{96}{20} = \frac{24}{5} \).

Thus, the side length of the square \( DEFG \) is \( \frac{24}{5} \).
