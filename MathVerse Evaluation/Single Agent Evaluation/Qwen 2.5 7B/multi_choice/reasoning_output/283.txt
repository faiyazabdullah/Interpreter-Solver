QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:

To solve for \( FG \), we need to use the properties of circles and the given information about the chords and their perpendicular distances from the center.

1. **Identify Key Properties**:
   - \( MK \) and \( MP \) are radii of the circle.
   - \( MK \) is perpendicular to chord \( FG \).
   - \( MP \) is perpendicular to chord \( HJ \).
   - The length of \( FL = 24 \).
   - The length of \( HJ = 48 \).
   - The measure of arc \( HP \) is \( 65^\circ \).

2. **Calculate the Length of \( HJ \)**:
   - Since \( MP \) is perpendicular to \( HJ \) and \( M \) is the center, \( HJ \) is bisected by \( MP \). Therefore, \( HP = PJ \).
   - The length of \( HP \) can be calculated using the cosine rule in triangle \( MPH \):
     \[
     HP^2 = MH^2 + MP^2 - 2 \cdot MH \cdot MP \cdot \cos(65^\circ)
     \]
   - However, since \( MP \) is a radius and the exact value is not provided, we use the fact that the length of \( HJ \) is directly given as 48.

3. **Calculate the Length of \( FG \)**:
   - Similarly, since \( MK \) is perpendicular to \( FG \) and \( M \) is the center, \( FG \) is bisected by \( MK \).
   - The length of \( FG \) can be calculated using the same method as above:
     \[
     FG^2 = FM^2 + MK^2 - 2 \cdot FM \cdot MK \cdot \cos(65^\circ)
     \]
   - Again, without the exact radius value, we use the fact that the length of \( FG \) is directly related to the length of \( HJ \) due to symmetry and equal lengths of chords.

Given the symmetry and the fact that the problem involves equal lengths of chords, we conclude that \( FG = HJ \).

Therefore, the length of \( FG \) is 48.
