QUESTION:
The figure has two segments. Use the vertical line test to determine whether the curve is the graph of a function.

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine whether the curve is the graph of a function using the vertical line test, we need to check if every vertical line intersects the curve at most once. 

1. Examine the curve in the image.
2. Observe that for some vertical lines, they intersect the curve more than once, which violates the vertical line test.
3. Specifically, there appears to be a vertical line passing through the curve at some point where it intersects the curve more than once.

Therefore, the curve does not pass the vertical line test, meaning it is not the graph of a function.

Final Answer: B
