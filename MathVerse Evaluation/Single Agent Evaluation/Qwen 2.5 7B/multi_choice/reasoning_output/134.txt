QUESTION:
As shown in the picture, Xiaoying designed a flashlight to measure the height of an ancient city wall. Place a horizontal plane mirror at point P. The light starts from point A and is reflected by the plane mirror and hits the top C of the ancient city wall CD. It is known that AB perpendicular  BD, CD perpendicular  BD. And it is measured that AB = 1.4, BP = 2.1, PD = 12.0. Then the height of the ancient city wall CD is ()

CHOICES:
A:6米
B:8米
C:10米
D:12米

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. This means that the path of the light ray will form two right triangles, \( \triangle ABP \) and \( \triangle CDP \), which are similar because they share the same angle at point P and both have right angles.

Given:
- \( AB = 1.4 \)
- \( BP = 2.1 \)
- \( PD = 12.0 \)

We can set up the proportion based on the similarity of the triangles:
\[ \frac{AB}{BP} = \frac{CD}{PD} \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ \frac{1.4}{2.1} = \frac{CD}{12} \]

Simplifying the left side:
\[ \frac{1.4}{2.1} = \frac{2}{3} \]

So, we have:
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{CD}{12} \]

Solving for \( CD \):
\[ CD = \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \]

Thus, the height of the ancient city wall \( CD \) is 8 meters.
