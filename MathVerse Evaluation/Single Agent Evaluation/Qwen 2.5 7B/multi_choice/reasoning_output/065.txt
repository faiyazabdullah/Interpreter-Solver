QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, angle 1 = angle 2, angle 4 = 30.0, then angle 3 is equal to ()

CHOICES:
A:120°
B:130°
C:145°
D:150°

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given geometric figure and use the information provided to find the measure of angle 3.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Angle 1 = Angle 2.
   - Angle 4 = 30°.

2. **Understand the geometric relationships:**
   - Since Angle 1 and Angle 2 are corresponding angles formed by a transversal intersecting two parallel lines (line \(a\) and line \(b\)), they are equal.
   - This implies that the lines \(c\) and \(d\) are also parallel because the corresponding angles are equal.

3. **Determine the relationship between angles 3 and 4:**
   - Angles 3 and 4 form a linear pair (they are adjacent and their non-common sides form a straight line).
   - The sum of the measures of a linear pair is always 180°.

4. **Calculate the measure of angle 3:**
   \[
   \text{Angle 3} + \text{Angle 4} = 180°
   \]
   Given that Angle 4 = 30°, we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   \text{Angle 3} + 30° = 180°
   \]
   Solving for Angle 3:
   \[
   \text{Angle 3} = 180° - 30° = 150°
   \]

5. **Compare the calculated result with the given answer choices:**
   - The calculated measure of Angle 3 is 150°.
   - The closest matching choice is D: 150°.
