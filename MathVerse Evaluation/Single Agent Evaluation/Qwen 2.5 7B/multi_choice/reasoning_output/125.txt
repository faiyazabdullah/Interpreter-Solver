QUESTION:
As shown in a sector iron sheet OAB, it is known that OA = 30.0, angle AOB = 120.0, the worker master combines OA and OB to form a conical chimney cap (the joints are ignored), then the radius of the bottom circle of the chimney cap is ()

CHOICES:
A:5cm
B:12cm
C:10cm
D:15cm

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the radius of the base of the cone formed by the sector OAB.

1. **Identify the arc length of the sector:**
   The arc length \(L\) of the sector can be calculated using the formula for the arc length of a sector:
   \[
   L = \theta \times r
   \]
   where \(\theta\) is the central angle in radians and \(r\) is the radius of the sector.

   Here, \(\theta = 120^\circ = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians and \(r = 30\):
   \[
   L = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times 30 = 20\pi
   \]

2. **Relate the arc length to the circumference of the base of the cone:**
   When the sector is combined to form the cone, the arc length \(L\) becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let \(R\) be the radius of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base of the cone is given by:
   \[
   2\pi R = 20\pi
   \]

3. **Solve for \(R\):**
   \[
   2\pi R = 20\pi
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(2\pi\):
   \[
   R = \frac{20\pi}{2\pi} = 10
   \]

Therefore, the radius of the base of the cone is \(10\) cm.
