QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, Xiaodong uses a bamboo pole with a length of 3.2 as a measuring tool to measure the height of the school flagpole, and moves the bamboo pole so that the shadow on the top of the pole and the flag pole falls on the same point on the ground. At this time, the distance between the bamboo pole and this point is 8.0, and the distance from the flag pole is 22.0, then the height of the flag pole is ()

CHOICES:
A:12m
B:10m
C:8m
D:7m

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify Similar Triangles:**
   - Triangle formed by the bamboo pole and its shadow.
   - Triangle formed by the flagpole and its shadow.

2. **Set Up Proportions:**
   - Let \( h \) be the height of the flagpole.
   - The total length of the shadow cast by the flagpole is the sum of the bamboo pole's shadow (8 m) and the flagpole's shadow (22 m), which is 30 m.
   - The height of the bamboo pole is 3.2 m.

3. **Form the Proportion:**
   - The ratio of the height of the bamboo pole to its shadow length is the same as the ratio of the height of the flagpole to its shadow length.
   \[
   \frac{3.2}{8} = \frac{h}{30}
   \]

4. **Solve for \( h \):**
   \[
   \frac{3.2}{8} = \frac{h}{30}
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   0.4 = \frac{h}{30}
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 30:
   \[
   h = 0.4 \times 30 = 12
   \]

Thus, the height of the flagpole is 12 meters.
