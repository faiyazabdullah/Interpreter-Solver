QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the quickest way for Sally to get from the school to the bus stop, we need to compare the distances involved. The image shows two paths:

1. A direct path from the school to the bus stop.
2. A path through the playground.

From the image, it appears that the direct path (orange line) is shorter than the path through the playground (yellow line). This can be inferred because the orange line forms a straight line between the two points, which is the shortest distance between them.

Therefore, the quickest way to get from the school to the bus stop is not through the playground.

Final Answer: A
