====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the radius of the base of the cone. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information**: The expanded figure of the lateral surface of the cone is a semicircle with a radius of 10. This means the slant height of the cone (which is the radius of the semicircle) is 10.

2. **Understand the relationship**: The circumference of the base of the cone is equal to the arc length of the semicircle. The arc length of a semicircle with radius 10 is \( \pi \times 10 = 10\pi \). This is also the circumference of the base of the cone.

3. **Calculate the radius of the base**: The circumference of the base of the cone is \( 2\pi r \), where \( r \) is the radius of the base. Setting this equal to the arc length, we get:
   \[
   2\pi r = 10\pi
   \]
   Solving for \( r \):
   \[
   r = \frac{10\pi}{2\pi} = 5
   \]

Therefore, the radius of the base of the cone is 5.
