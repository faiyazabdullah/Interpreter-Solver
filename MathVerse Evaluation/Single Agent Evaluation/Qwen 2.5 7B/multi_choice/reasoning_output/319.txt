To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar figures and the relationship between their areas and corresponding side lengths.

1. **Identify the similarity ratio**:
   - The diagonals of the blue and green quadrilaterals are given as 8 yd and 4 yd respectively.
   - Since the diagonals of a rhombus (assuming these are rhombuses for simplicity) bisect each other at right angles, the sides of the blue quadrilateral are related to its diagonal by the formula \( s = \frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot d}{2} \).
   - However, since we don't have the side lengths directly, we can use the fact that the area of a rhombus is proportional to the square of the product of its diagonals.
   
2. **Calculate the area ratio**:
   - The area of a rhombus is given by \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d_1 \times d_2 \), but here we can use the simpler relationship for similar figures.
   - The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
   - The ratio of the diagonals is \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \).
   - Therefore, the ratio of the areas is \( 2^2 = 4 \).

3. **Find the area of the green quadrilateral**:
   - The area of the blue quadrilateral is given as 36 yd².
   - Let the area of the green quadrilateral be \( A_g \).
   - According to the area ratio, \( \frac{A_g}{36} = 4 \).
   - Solving for \( A_g \), we get \( A_g = 36 \times 4 = 144 \).

Thus, the area of the green figure is 144 yd².
