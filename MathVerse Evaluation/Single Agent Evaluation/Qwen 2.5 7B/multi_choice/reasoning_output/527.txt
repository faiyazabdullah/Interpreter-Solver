QUESTION:
There is a function representing a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1 unit. There is a point A on the circle with an angle of $\frac{\pi}{5}$ to the negative x-axis. What is the value of the x-coordinate of point A?

CHOICES:
A:$\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)$
B:$\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)$
C:$\sin \left(\frac{6 \pi}{5}\right)$
D:$\cos \left(\frac{6 \pi}{5}\right)$
E:$\sin \left(\frac{9 \pi}{5}\right)$
F:$\cos \left(\frac{9 \pi}{5}\right)$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the x-coordinate of point A, we need to use the cosine of the angle it makes with the negative x-axis. Since point A is located on the circle and forms an angle of $\frac{\pi}{5}$ with the negative x-axis, the x-coordinate of point A can be determined using the cosine function.

The cosine of an angle in standard position (measured from the positive x-axis) is equal to the x-coordinate of the point where the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle.

Given that the angle is $\frac{\pi}{5}$ with respect to the negative x-axis, we can convert this to a standard angle by adding $\pi$ (since the negative x-axis corresponds to $\pi$ radians). Thus, the equivalent angle is:

$$ \theta = \pi + \frac{\pi}{5} = \frac{5\pi}{5} + \frac{\pi}{5} = \frac{6\pi}{5} $$

So, the x-coordinate of point A is $\cos\left(\frac{6\pi}{5}\right)$.
