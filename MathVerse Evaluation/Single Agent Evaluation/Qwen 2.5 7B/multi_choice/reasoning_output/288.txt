QUESTION:
There is a right triangle A B F on top of a rectangle C D E F. \angle C F D is labeled as \angle 2. Find m \angle 2.

CHOICES:
A:39
B:42
C:48
D:51

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( \angle 2 \):

1. Identify the given angles: 
   - \(\angle AFB = 48^\circ\)
   - \(\angle FDE = 39^\circ\)

2. Note that \(\angle CFD\) (labeled as \(\angle 2\)) is part of the straight line formed by extending \( \overline{AF} \) and \( \overline{CD} \).

3. Since \(\angle AFB\) and \(\angle 2\) are supplementary angles (they form a straight line):
   \[
   \angle 2 = 180^\circ - \angle AFB
   \]

4. Substitute the given value of \(\angle AFB\):
   \[
   \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 48^\circ = 132^\circ
   \]

However, there seems to be a misunderstanding because we need to find \(\angle 2\) within the context provided, and it's given as part of the problem involving other angles. Let's recheck the setup:

5. Given that \(\angle FDE = 39^\circ\) and considering the right angle at \(F\), we need to find the angle adjacent to \(\angle 2\) which is part of the rectangle.
   
6. Since \(\angle 2\) is adjacent to \(\angle AFB\) and forms a right angle with the rectangle, the correct calculation should be:
   \[
   \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 48^\circ - 39^\circ = 93^\circ - 48^\circ = 42^\circ
   \]

Thus, the correct measure of \(\angle 2\) is \(42^\circ\).
