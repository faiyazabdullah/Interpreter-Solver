QUESTION:
The logarithm function and a line are graphed. Logarithm function $f$ is graphed in blue and it goes through (30,4), (5,2), (55,5). Line $y=4$ is graphed in red and parallel to x-axis. A pharmaceutical scientist making a new medication wonders how much of the active ingredient to include in a dose. They are curious how long different amounts of the active ingredient will stay in someone's bloodstream.

The amount of time (in hours) the active ingredient remains in the bloodstream can be modeled by $f(x)=-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, where $x$ is the initial amount of the active ingredient (in milligrams). Here is the graph of $f$ and the graph of the line $y=4$.

Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection point of the graphs?

Choose all answers that apply:

CHOICES:
A:It describes the amount of time the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream if the initial amount of the active ingredient is $4 \mathrm{mg}$.
B:
C:It gives the solution to the equation $-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=4$.
D:It describes the situation where the initial amount of the active ingredient is equal to how long it stays in the bloodstream.
E:
F:It gives the initial amount of the active ingredient such that the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.
