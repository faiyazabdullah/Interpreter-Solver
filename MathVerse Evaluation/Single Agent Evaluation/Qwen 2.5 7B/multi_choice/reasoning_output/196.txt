To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the torus given the length of the chord \( AB \) which is tangent to the smaller circle. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The length of the chord \( AB = 8 \).

2. **Understand the geometry:**
   - The chord \( AB \) is tangent to the smaller circle.
   - The distance from the center of the smaller circle to the chord \( AB \) is half the radius of the smaller circle because it is perpendicular to the chord at its midpoint.

3. **Calculate the radius of the smaller circle:**
   - Let the radius of the smaller circle be \( r \).
   - The distance from the center of the smaller circle to the chord \( AB \) is \( r \).

4. **Use the Pythagorean theorem:**
   - The radius of the larger circle (torus) is \( R \).
   - The distance from the center of the smaller circle to the center of the larger circle is \( R - r \).
   - The length of \( AB \) is 8, so the distance from the center of the smaller circle to the midpoint of \( AB \) is 4 (half of 8).

5. **Set up the equation using the Pythagorean theorem:**
   \[
   (R - r)^2 + 4^2 = R^2
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   (R - r)^2 + 16 = R^2
   \]
   Expanding and simplifying further:
   \[
   R^2 - 2Rr + r^2 + 16 = R^2
   \]
   \[
   -2Rr + r^2 + 16 = 0
   \]
   \[
   r^2 - 2Rr + 16 = 0
   \]

6. **Solve for \( R \):**
   - We know \( r = 4 \) (since the distance from the center of the smaller circle to the chord is half the length of the chord).
   - Substitute \( r = 4 \):
   \[
   4^2 - 2R \cdot 4 + 16 = 0
   \]
   \[
   16 - 8R + 16 = 0
   \]
   \[
   32 - 8R = 0
   \]
   \[
   8R = 32
   \]
   \[
   R = 4
   \]

7. **Calculate the area of the torus:**
   - The area \( A \) of a torus is given by:
   \[
   A = 2 \pi R \cdot 2 \pi r = 4 \pi R^2
   \]
   - Substituting \( R = 4 \):
   \[
   A = 4 \pi (4)^2 = 4 \pi \cdot 16 = 64 \pi
   \]

Thus, the area of the torus is \( 64 \pi \).
