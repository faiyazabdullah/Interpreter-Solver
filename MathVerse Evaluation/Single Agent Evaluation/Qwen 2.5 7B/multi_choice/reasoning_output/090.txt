QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle that subtend the same arc.

1. The measure of the central angle AOB is given as 50 degrees.
2. According to the Inscribed Angle Theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
3. Therefore, the measure of the inscribed angle ACB, which subtends the same arc AB, is:
   \[
   \text{Measure of } \angle ACB = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } \angle AOB = \frac{1}{2} \times 50^\circ = 25^\circ
   \]

Thus, the degree of the angle of the circumference angle ACB is 25 degrees.

Final Answer: B
