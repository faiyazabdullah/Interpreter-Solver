QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, when planting trees on flat ground, the plant spacing (the horizontal distance between two adjacent trees) is required to be 4.0. If trees are planted on a hillside with a slope of 0.75, and the plant spacing is also required to be 4.0, then the slope distance between two adjacent trees is ()

CHOICES:
A:5m
B:6m
C:7m
D:8m

To solve this problem, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, the plant spacing (horizontal distance) is 4.0 meters, and the slope of the hillside is 0.75.

Let's denote:
- The horizontal distance as \( x = 4.0 \) meters.
- The vertical distance as \( y \).
- The slope as 0.75, meaning for every 1 meter of horizontal distance, there is 0.75 meters of vertical distance.

Using the slope:
\[ \frac{y}{x} = 0.75 \]
\[ y = 0.75 \times 4.0 \]
\[ y = 3.0 \] meters

Now, we can find the hypotenuse (the actual distance between two adjacent trees), using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d^2 = x^2 + y^2 \]
\[ d^2 = 4.0^2 + 3.0^2 \]
\[ d^2 = 16.0 + 9.0 \]
\[ d^2 = 25.0 \]
\[ d = \sqrt{25.0} \]
\[ d = 5.0 \]

So, the slope distance between two adjacent trees is 5.0 meters.
