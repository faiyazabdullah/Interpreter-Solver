====================================================================================================
To find the true bearing of point B from point C, we need to determine the direction of line BC relative to the north direction. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the angles at point C:**
   - Angle ACB is the internal angle of triangle ABC, which can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Angle ACB} = 180^\circ - \text{Angle A} - \text{Angle B} = 180^\circ - 49^\circ - 41^\circ = 90^\circ
     \]

2. **Determine the direction of line BC:**
   - Since angle ACB is 90 degrees, line BC is perpendicular to line AC. Therefore, the direction of line BC is 90 degrees clockwise from the north direction.

3. **Convert the direction to true bearing:**
   - True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction. So, the true bearing of point B from point C is 090 degrees T.

However, none of the provided choices match 090 degrees T. Given the options, the closest choice is:
