QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use some geometric properties related to circles and tangents.

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   - Since \(PA\) and \(PB\) are tangents from the same external point \(P\), they are equal in length (\(PA = PB\)).
   - The point of tangency \(A\) and \(B\) form right angles with the radii \(OA\) and \(OB\) respectively because the radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of tangency.
   - Therefore, \(\angle OAP = \angle OBP = 90^\circ\).

2. **Angle Sum in Triangle \(OAP\):**
   - In triangle \(OAP\), the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\).
   - So, \(\angle AOP + \angle OAP + \angle PAO = 180^\circ\).
   - Since \(\angle OAP = 90^\circ\), we have \(\angle AOP + 90^\circ + \angle PAO = 180^\circ\).
   - Therefore, \(\angle AOP + \angle PAO = 90^\circ\).

3. **Relate \(\angle AOP\) to \(\angle ACB\):**
   - Since \(AC\) is the diameter of the circle, \(\angle ABC\) subtended by the diameter is a right angle (\(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\)).
   - The angle \(\angle ACB\) is half of the central angle \(\angle AOB\) (which is twice the inscribed angle \(\angle ACB\)).

4. **Calculate \(\angle AOB\):**
   - Given \(\angle APB = 50^\circ\), since \(PA\) and \(PB\) are tangents from the same external point, \(\angle AOB = 2 \times \angle APB = 2 \times 50^\circ = 100^\circ\).

5. **Find \(\angle ACB\):**
   - Since \(\angle ACB\) is half of \(\angle AOB\), \(\angle ACB = \frac{100^\circ}{2} = 50^\circ\).

Therefore, the size of \(\angle ACB\) is \(50^\circ\).
