QUESTION:
Catalina opened a new restaurant. She modeled the relationship between the number of months $T$ since she opened the restaurant and its profit $P$ (in dollars, measured as income minus expenses) as
$$
P=80(T-4)^2-300 \text {. }
$$ She wanted to create a graph to show the restaurant's profits over the first year. From month=0 to month=2, the profit decreases when months increase. From month=6 to month =13, profit increases when months increase. Here is her work: What mistakes did Catalina make when drawing the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Inappropriate scale for $x$-axis
B:Inappropriate scale for $y$-axis
C:Wrong/missing label for $x$-axis
D:Wrong/missing label for $y$-axis
E:Catalina didn't make any mistake
