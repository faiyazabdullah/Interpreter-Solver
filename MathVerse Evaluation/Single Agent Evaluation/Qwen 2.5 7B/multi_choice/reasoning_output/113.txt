QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in circle O, chord AC and BD intersect at point E, arc AB = arc BC = arc CD, if angle BEC = 110.0, then angle BDC = ()

CHOICES:
A:35°
B:45°
C:55°
D:70°

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information**: Arc AB = arc BC = arc CD.
2. **Understand the relationship between arcs and central angles**: Since the arcs are equal, the central angles subtended by these arcs will also be equal. Therefore, ∠AOB = ∠BOC = ∠COD.
3. **Use the property of cyclic quadrilaterals**: In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary (sum up to 180 degrees).
4. **Calculate the angles**: Since the arcs are equal, each of the central angles subtending these arcs is 120°/3 = 40°.
5. **Determine ∠BDC**: ∠BDC is an inscribed angle subtending arc BC. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So, ∠BDC = 1/2 * ∠BOC = 1/2 * 120° = 60°.
6. **Check the options**: The closest option to 60° among the choices provided is 60°.

Given the options and the closest match, the correct answer is:
