QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, AB is a ladder leaning against the wall, the foot of the ladder is away from the wall 2.0, the point D on the ladder is away from the wall 1.8, the length of BD is 0.6, then the length of the ladder is ()

CHOICES:
A:5.60米
B:6.00米
C:6.10米
D:6.20米

To solve the problem, we need to find the length of the ladder (AB) using the given information and applying the Pythagorean theorem.

1. Identify the given information:
   - The distance from the foot of the ladder to the wall (BD) = 2.0 meters.
   - The distance from point D to the wall (AD) = 1.8 meters.
   - The length of BD = 0.6 meters.

2. Determine the length of AD:
   Since D is on the ladder, we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD to find AB. However, we need to first find the length of AB directly using the given distances.

3. Use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABD:
   \[
   AB^2 = BD^2 + AD^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   AB^2 = 2.0^2 + 1.8^2 = 4.00 + 3.24 = 7.24
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   AB = \sqrt{7.24} \approx 2.69 \text{ meters}
   \]
