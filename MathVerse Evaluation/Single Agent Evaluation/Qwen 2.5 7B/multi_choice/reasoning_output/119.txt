To solve this problem, we need to find the area of the sector of the circular cardboard that will form the conical hat. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Radius of the sector (cardboard) \( R = 24 \) cm.
   - Radius of the base of the cone (bottom surface of the conical hat) \( r = 10 \) cm.

2. **Understand the relationship between the sector and the cone:**
   - When the sector is formed into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
   - The circumference of the base of the cone is given by \( 2 \pi r \).
   - Therefore, the arc length of the sector is \( 2 \pi r = 2 \pi \times 10 = 20 \pi \).

3. **Calculate the central angle of the sector:**
   - The formula for the arc length of a sector is \( \theta \times R \), where \( \theta \) is the central angle in radians.
   - So, \( 20 \pi = \theta \times 24 \).
   - Solving for \( \theta \), we get \( \theta = \frac{20 \pi}{24} = \frac{5 \pi}{6} \) radians.

4. **Calculate the area of the sector:**
   - The area of a sector is given by \( \frac{\theta}{2 \pi} \times \pi R^2 \).
   - Substituting the values, we get \( \text{Area} = \frac{\frac{5 \pi}{6}}{2 \pi} \times \pi \times 24^2 = \frac{5 \pi}{12} \times 576 \pi = 240 \pi \) cm².

Therefore, the area of the sector cardboard is \( 240 \pi \) cm².
