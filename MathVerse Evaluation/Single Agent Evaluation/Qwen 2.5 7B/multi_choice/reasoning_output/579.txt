QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

Which of the following could model the percentage that Lucy can still recall after $t$ days?

CHOICES:
A:$Q=(0.85)^{t}$
B:$Q=(0.83)^{t}$
C:$Q=(0.87)^{t}$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the graph and the given information about the decay of memory over time.

1. **Examine the Graph:**
   - The x-axis represents the number of days.
   - The y-axis represents the recall percentage.
   - Maximilian's curve is represented by the black line.
   - Lucy's curve is represented by the gray line.
   - Both curves show a decreasing trend, indicating that both Maximilian and Lucy's recall percentages decrease over time.
   - The initial recall percentage for both is 100%, which aligns with the starting point on the y-axis.

2. **Understand the Decay Rate:**
   - The problem states that Maximilian forgets 15% of what he could recount the previous day. This means he retains 85% of his previous day's recall percentage.
   - Therefore, the decay rate for Maximilian is 0.85.

3. **Analyze Lucy's Curve:**
   - Lucy's curve is smoother than Maximilian's, suggesting a slower decay rate.
   - To find Lucy's decay rate, we need to observe how quickly her curve decreases compared to Maximilian's.

4. **Compare the Decay Rates:**
   - Maximilian's decay rate is 0.85.
   - Lucy's curve appears to decrease more slowly, suggesting a higher retention rate.

5. **Evaluate the Given Options:**
   - Option A: \( Q = (0.85)^t \)
   - Option B: \( Q = (0.83)^t \)
   - Option C: \( Q = (0.87)^t \)

6. **Determine the Best Fit:**
   - Since Lucy's curve is smoother and slower, we need to choose a decay rate that is slightly higher than Maximilian's but still reflects a slower decline.
   - Option C, \( Q = (0.87)^t \), has a decay rate of 0.87, which is slightly higher than 0.85 but still indicates a slower decay compared to 0.85.

Based on the analysis, the best fit for Lucy's curve is:
