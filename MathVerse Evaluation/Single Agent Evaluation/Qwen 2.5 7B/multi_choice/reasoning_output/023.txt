QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use some geometric properties related to tangents and inscribed angles.

1. Since PA and PB are tangents to the circle at points A and B respectively, the radii OA and OB are perpendicular to the tangents at these points. Therefore, ∠OAP = 90° and ∠OBP = 90°.
   
2. The sum of the angles around point O is 360°. Thus, ∠AOB can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \angle AOB = 360° - 90° - 90° - \text{angle between } OA \text{ and } OB.
   \]
   The angle between OA and OB is twice the angle subtended by the arc AB at the circumference (since ∠C = 65° is an angle subtended by arc AB at the circumference). So,
   \[
   \angle AOB = 360° - 90° - 90° - 2 \times 65° = 130°.
   \]

3. In triangle APB, the sum of the angles is 180°. We know ∠OAP = 90° and ∠OBP = 90°, so the remaining angle P can be calculated as:
   \[
   \angle P = 180° - 90° - 90° + \angle AOB = 180° - 90° - 90° + 130° = 130°.
   \]

Therefore, the degree of angle P is 130°.
