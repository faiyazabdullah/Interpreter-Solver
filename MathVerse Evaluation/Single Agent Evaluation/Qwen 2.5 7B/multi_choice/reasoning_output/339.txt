QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the true bearing of point B from point A, we need to consider the direction in which point B is located relative to point A. Since point B is due East of point A, the true bearing will be 90 degrees.

Let's break it down:

1. Point A is at the origin (0 degrees).
2. Point B is directly East of point A, so the angle relative to North is 90 degrees.

The true bearing is the angle measured clockwise from the North direction. Therefore, the true bearing of point B from point A is 090 degrees.

Final Answer: A
