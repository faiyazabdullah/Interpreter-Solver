To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of the cone formed when the sector of a circle with a central angle of 120 degrees and a radius of 3 cm is rolled up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the arc length of the sector:**
   The formula for the arc length \( L \) of a sector with a central angle \( \theta \) (in degrees) and radius \( r \) is:
   \[
   L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
   \]
   Given \( \theta = 120^\circ \) and \( r = 3 \):
   \[
   L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 3 = \frac{1}{3} \times 6\pi = 2\pi
   \]

2. **Determine the circumference of the base of the cone:**
   When the sector is rolled up to form the cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
   \[
   \text{Circumference of the base} = 2\pi r_{\text{base}}
   \]
   Since the arc length is \( 2\pi \):
   \[
   2\pi r_{\text{base}} = 2\pi \implies r_{\text{base}} = 1
   \]

3. **Calculate the slant height of the cone:**
   The slant height of the cone is the same as the radius of the original sector, which is 3 cm.

4. **Determine the height of the cone using the Pythagorean theorem:**
   In a right triangle formed by the height \( h \), the radius \( r_{\text{base}} \), and the slant height, we have:
   \[
   h^2 + r_{\text{base}}^2 = \text{slant height}^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   h^2 + 1^2 = 3^2 \implies h^2 + 1 = 9 \implies h^2 = 8 \implies h = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}
   \]

Thus, the height of the cone is \( 2\sqrt{2} \) cm.
