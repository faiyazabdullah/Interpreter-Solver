To solve this problem, let's analyze the given geometric configuration step-by-step:

1. **Identify Given Information**:
   - \( O \) is a point inside the quadrilateral \( ABCD \).
   - \( OA = OB = OC \), which means \( O \) is equidistant from \( A, B, \) and \( C \). This implies that \( O \) lies on the perpendicular bisectors of \( AB \) and \( BC \).
   - \( \angle ABC = \angle ADC = 65^\circ \).

2. **Understand the Configuration**:
   - Since \( OA = OB = OC \), \( O \) is the circumcenter of \( \triangle ABC \). Therefore, \( \angle BOC \) can be calculated using the fact that the angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc.
   - Let’s calculate \( \angle BOC \):
     \[
     \angle BOC = 2 \times \angle BAC
     \]
     However, we don’t have \( \angle BAC \) directly. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BOC = 360^\circ - \angle ABC - \angle BDC \). Given \( \angle ABC = 65^\circ \) and \( \angle ADC = 65^\circ \), we need to find the relationship between these angles.

3. **Calculate \( \angle BOC \)**:
   - Since \( \angle BOC \) is the external angle to the triangle formed by the diagonals intersecting at \( O \), and knowing that the sum of the opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral is \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     \angle BOC = 360^\circ - 2 \times 65^\circ = 230^\circ
     \]

4. **Determine \( \angle DAO + \angle DCO \)**:
   - Since \( O \) is the circumcenter, \( \angle DAO \) and \( \angle DCO \) are related to the angles of the triangle and the central angle. Specifically, they are half of the central angles minus the corresponding angles at the vertices.
   - We know \( \angle BOC = 230^\circ \), so:
     \[
     \angle DAO + \angle DCO = 90^\circ - \frac{1}{2} \times (230^\circ - 180^\circ) = 90^\circ - 25^\circ = 65^\circ
     \]

However, we need to consider the internal angles correctly. The correct approach is to use the symmetry and properties of the quadrilateral and the circumcenter:
- The sum of the angles \( \angle DAO \) and \( \angle DCO \) can be deduced from the symmetry and the properties of the quadrilateral.

Given the options, the correct answer should be:
