QUESTION:
After filling some oil in a cylindrical oil tank with a diameter of 200.0, the cross section is shown in the figure. If the width of the oil surface AB = 160.0, the maximum depth of oil is ()

CHOICES:
A:40cm
B:60cm
C:80cm
D:100cm

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum depth of oil in the cylindrical tank.

1. **Examine the Geometry:**
   - The diameter of the cylinder is 200 cm, so the radius \( r \) is \( 100 \) cm.
   - The width of the oil surface \( AB = 160 \) cm.

2. **Identify Relevant Information:**
   - The oil forms a segment of the circle with chord \( AB = 160 \) cm.
   - We need to find the distance from the center \( O \) to the chord \( AB \), which will help us determine the depth of the oil.

3. **Calculate the Distance from Center to Chord:**
   - Draw a perpendicular from the center \( O \) to the chord \( AB \). This perpendicular bisects \( AB \) into two equal segments of 80 cm each.
   - Let \( M \) be the midpoint of \( AB \). So, \( OM \) is the distance from the center to the chord and \( AM = 80 \) cm.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \( OMA \):
     \[
     OA^2 = OM^2 + AM^2
     \]
     \[
     100^2 = OM^2 + 80^2
     \]
     \[
     10000 = OM^2 + 6400
     \]
     \[
     OM^2 = 3600
     \]
     \[
     OM = \sqrt{3600} = 60 \text{ cm}
     \]

4. **Determine the Maximum Depth of Oil:**
   - The maximum depth of the oil is the distance from the center \( O \) to the bottom of the cylinder minus the distance from the center to the chord \( OM \).
   - The radius of the cylinder is 100 cm, so the depth of the oil is:
     \[
     100 - 60 = 40 \text{ cm}
     \]

Therefore, the maximum depth of oil is 40 cm.
