QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, triangle ABC congruent triangle DEF, points A and D, B and E are the corresponding vertices, and the measured BC = 5.0, BF = 7.0, then the length of EC is ()

CHOICES:
A:1cm
B:2cm
C:3cm
D:4cm

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use the property of congruent triangles. Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, the corresponding sides are equal. This means AB = DE, AC = DF, and BC = EF.

Given:
- BC = 5.0 cm
- BF = 7.0 cm

Since BC = EF and BC = 5.0 cm, it follows that EF = 5.0 cm. Now, we need to find the length of EC. We know that BF = BE + EF and since BE + EF = 7.0 cm and EF = 5.0 cm, we can calculate BE as follows:

BE = BF - EF
BE = 7.0 - 5.0
BE = 2.0 cm

Since BE = EC (because B and E are the corresponding vertices of congruent triangles), EC = 2.0 cm.

Therefore, the length of EC is 2.0 cm.

Final Answer: B
