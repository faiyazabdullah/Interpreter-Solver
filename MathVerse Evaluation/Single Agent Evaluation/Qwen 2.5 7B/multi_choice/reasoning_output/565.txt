QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function going through (0,-2), (-1,0), (2,0), (3,4), (-2,4). f(x)=x^2+x-6. How many roots do the functions have in common?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ and $g$ share the same root(s).
B:$f$ and $g$ share one root in common but each have another root that is not shared.
C:$f$ and $g$ share no roots in common.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many roots the functions \( f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 \) and \( g(x) \) share.

First, let's find the roots of \( f(x) \):
\[ f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 = 0 \]
We can factorize this quadratic equation:
\[ x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0 \]
So, the roots are:
\[ x = -3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 2 \]

Next, let's look at the graph of \( g(x) \) to see its roots:
From the graph, we can see that \( g(x) \) has roots at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 2 \).

Now, compare the roots:
- The roots of \( f(x) \) are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \).
- The roots of \( g(x) \) are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 2 \).

We see that the only root that both functions share is \( x = 2 \). Therefore, they share one root in common but each have another root that is not shared.
