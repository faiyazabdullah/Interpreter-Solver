====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   - AB is the diameter of the circle, so angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees) because the angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is always 90 degrees.
   - Angle ADC = 26 degrees.
   - Since AB is the diameter, triangle ACB is a right triangle with angle ACB = 90 degrees.

2. **Use Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - Angle ADC is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AC. According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the arc it intercepts.
   - Therefore, the measure of arc AC is 2 * 26 = 52 degrees.

3. **Determine Angle CAB:**
   - Angle CAB is also an inscribed angle that intercepts the same arc AC.
   - Since angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees), and angle CAB is part of this right triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
   - Let angle CAB be x. Then angle BAC = 90 - x.
   - Since angle BAC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc BC, and arc BC is the remaining part of the circle minus arc AC, which is 360 - 52 = 308 degrees.
   - However, we only need to focus on the relevant arc for angle CAB, which is arc AC. So, angle BAC = 90 - x = 90 - 26 = 64 degrees.

Thus, the measure of angle CAB is 64 degrees.
