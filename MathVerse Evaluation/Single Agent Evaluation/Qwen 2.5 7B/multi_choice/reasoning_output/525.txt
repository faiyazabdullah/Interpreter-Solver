QUESTION:
There is a function representing a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 1 unit. Points A,B, and C are plotted on the unit circle. Which of the coordinates is equal to \sin \left(310^{\circ}\right) ?

CHOICES:
A:x-coordinate of point A
B:y-coordinate of point A
C:x-coordinate of point B
D:y-coordinate of point B
E:x-coordinate of point C
F:y-coordinate of point C

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the sine of \(310^\circ\) and match it with the coordinates of points on the unit circle.

1. **Understanding Sine Function in the Unit Circle:**
   - The sine of an angle in standard position is the y-coordinate of the corresponding point on the unit circle.
   - The angle \(310^\circ\) is in the fourth quadrant where the cosine is positive and the sine is negative.

2. **Converting the Angle to the Reference Angle:**
   - The reference angle for \(310^\circ\) is \(360^\circ - 310^\circ = 50^\circ\).
   - Therefore, \(\sin(310^\circ) = -\sin(50^\circ)\).

3. **Identifying the Coordinates:**
   - Point A is located in the first quadrant, so its coordinates are \((\cos(50^\circ), \sin(50^\circ))\).
   - Point B is located in the fourth quadrant, so its coordinates are \((\cos(310^\circ), \sin(310^\circ))\).
   - Point C is located in the third quadrant, so its coordinates are \((\cos(230^\circ), \sin(230^\circ))\).

4. **Matching with the Answer Choices:**
   - The x-coordinate of point B corresponds to \(\cos(310^\circ)\), which is positive.
   - The y-coordinate of point B corresponds to \(\sin(310^\circ)\), which is negative.

Therefore, the y-coordinate of point B matches \(\sin(310^\circ)\).
