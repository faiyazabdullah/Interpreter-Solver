QUESTION:
As shown in the picture, it is an ancient masher in the countryside. It is known that the height of the support column AB is 0.3, the length of the pedal DE is 1.0, and the distance from the support point A to the foot D is 0.6. When foot D touches the ground, the head point E rises ()

CHOICES:
A:0.5米
B:0.6米
C:0.3米
D:0.9米

====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's analyze the geometric relationship between the points and the given measurements.

1. We have a right triangle \( \triangle ADE \) where \( AB = 0.3 \), \( DE = 1.0 \), and \( AD = 0.6 \).
2. We need to find the vertical displacement of point \( E \) when foot \( D \) touches the ground, i.e., we need to find the new height of point \( E \) relative to point \( A \).

First, calculate the length of \( AE \) using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ADE \):
\[ AE = \sqrt{AD^2 + DE^2} = \sqrt{0.6^2 + 1.0^2} = \sqrt{0.36 + 1.0} = \sqrt{1.36} = \sqrt{\frac{136}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{136}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{34}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{34}}{5} \]

Now, when foot \( D \) touches the ground, point \( D \) moves to the same horizontal level as point \( A \), so the new position of \( E \) will be directly above \( A \). Therefore, the vertical displacement of \( E \) is simply the length of \( AE \).

However, since \( AB = 0.3 \) and \( AE \) is the hypotenuse, the vertical displacement of \( E \) is the difference between the height of \( E \) and the height of \( A \), which is \( 1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7 \).

But considering the problem setup and the given options, the correct interpretation should be the direct height increase from \( A \) to the new position of \( E \), which is \( 1.0 - 0.3 = 0.7 \).

Given the options, the closest value is:
