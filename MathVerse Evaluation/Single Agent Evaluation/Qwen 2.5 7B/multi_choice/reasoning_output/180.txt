To solve this problem, we need to use some properties of circles and triangles inscribed within them.

1. **Identify Key Properties**:
   - Triangle \(ABC\) is inscribed in circle \(O\) with radius \(1\).
   - \(OC \perp OB\), implying that \(O\) is the center of the circle.
   - \(OD \perp AB\), where \(D\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \(O\) to \(AB\).
   - \(E\) is the intersection of \(OD\) and \(AC\).

2. **Use the Right Triangle Property**:
   - Since \(OD \perp AB\), \(OD\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(AB\). This implies that \(AD = DB\).

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   - In right triangle \(OCD\), since \(OD\) is perpendicular to \(AB\) and \(OD\) is the altitude from the center of the circle, \(OD\) splits \(AB\) into two equal segments.
   - Therefore, \(AE = EC\) because \(D\) is the midpoint of \(AB\).

4. **Calculate \(AE^2 + CE^2\)**:
   - Since \(AE = EC\), let's denote \(AE = x\). Then \(CE = x\).
   - By the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(AEC\):
     \[
     AE^2 + CE^2 = x^2 + x^2 = 2x^2
     \]
   - To find \(x\), note that \(AO = CO = 1\) (radius of the circle) and \(OD\) is the altitude from the center to the chord \(AB\).

5. **Determine \(x\)**:
   - Since \(OD\) is perpendicular to \(AB\) and \(AB\) is a chord, \(OD\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(AB\), making \(AD = DB\).
   - Given the symmetry and the fact that \(OD\) is the radius, we can deduce that \(AE = EC = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) when considering the geometry of the circle.

6. **Substitute \(x\) back**:
   - If \(AE = EC = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\), then:
     \[
     AE^2 + CE^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
     \]

Therefore, the value of \(AE^2 + CE^2\) is \(1\).
