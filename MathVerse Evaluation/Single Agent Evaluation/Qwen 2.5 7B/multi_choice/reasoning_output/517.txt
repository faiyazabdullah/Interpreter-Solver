QUESTION:
Consider the graphs of the functions $y=4^{x}$ and $y=\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{x}$. How would you describe the rate of increase of $y=4^{x}$ ?

CHOICES:
A.$y$ is increasing at a constant rate
B.$y$ is increasing at a decreasing rate
C.$y$ is increasing at an increasing rate

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To analyze the rate of increase of the function \( y = 4^x \):

1. The graph of \( y = 4^x \) shows an exponential growth curve.
2. As \( x \) increases, the value of \( y \) increases rapidly.
3. The slope of the tangent line to the curve at any point becomes steeper as \( x \) increases.
4. This indicates that the rate of increase of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) is not constant but rather increases as \( x \) increases.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
