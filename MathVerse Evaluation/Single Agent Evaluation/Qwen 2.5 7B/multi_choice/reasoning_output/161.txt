QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the homothetic figures are composed of a triangle ruler and its center projection under the light. If the ratio of the distance from the bulb to the vertex of the triangle ruler to the distance from the bulb to the corresponding vertex of the triangular ruler projection is 2.0:5.0, and the length of one edge of the triangle ruler is 8.0, Then the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is ()

CHOICES:
A:8cm
B:20cm
C:3.2cm
D:10cm

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles and the properties of homothety.

Given:
- The ratio of the distances from the bulb to the vertices of the original triangle to the distances from the bulb to the corresponding vertices of the projected triangle is 2.0:5.0.
- One edge of the original triangle (triangle ruler) is 8 cm.
- We need to find the corresponding edge length of the projected triangle.

Let's denote the length of the corresponding edge in the projected triangle as \( x \).

Since the triangles are similar and the ratio of the distances from the bulb to the corresponding vertices is 2.0:5.0, the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides of the two triangles is also 2.0:5.0.

So, we can set up the proportion:

\[
\frac{8}{x} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
8 \times 5 = 2 \times x
\]

\[
40 = 2x
\]

\[
x = \frac{40}{2} = 20
\]

Thus, the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is 20 cm.
