QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in a badminton game, Lin Dan, the athlete standing at M in the field, clicks the request from N to point B in the opponent. It is known that the net height OA = 1.52, OB = 4.0, OM = 5.0, then when Lin Dan takes off, the distance from the hitting point to the ground NM = ()

CHOICES:
A:3.42m
B:1.9m
C:3m
D:3.24m

To solve this problem, we need to find the distance \( NM \) using the given information about the right triangle formed by points \( O \), \( A \), and \( B \).

Step 1: Identify the given information.
- \( OA = 1.52 \) (height of the net)
- \( OB = 4.0 \) (horizontal distance from \( O \) to \( B \))
- \( OM = 5.0 \) (horizontal distance from \( M \) to \( O \))

Step 2: Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( AB \).
Since \( \triangle OAB \) is a right triangle with \( OA \) as the height and \( OB \) as the base, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:

\[ AB = \sqrt{OA^2 + OB^2} \]
\[ AB = \sqrt{1.52^2 + 4.0^2} \]
\[ AB = \sqrt{2.3104 + 16.00} \]
\[ AB = \sqrt{18.3104} \]
\[ AB \approx 4.28 \]

Step 3: Calculate the distance \( NM \).
Since \( NM \) is the total distance from \( M \) to \( B \), we add the horizontal distances \( OM \) and \( OB \):
\[ NM = OM + OB \]
\[ NM = 5.0 + 4.0 \]
\[ NM = 9.0 \]

However, since \( NM \) is actually the hypotenuse of the larger triangle \( \triangle ONM \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem again:
\[ NM = \sqrt{OM^2 + MB^2} \]
But since \( MB = OB \) and \( OB = 4.0 \):
\[ NM = \sqrt{5.0^2 + 4.0^2} \]
\[ NM = \sqrt{25.00 + 16.00} \]
\[ NM = \sqrt{41.00} \]
\[ NM \approx 6.4 \]

This calculation seems incorrect. Let's recheck the problem setup. Given the options, it seems there might be a simpler approach. Since \( NM \) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs \( OM \) and \( OB \), we can directly calculate:
\[ NM = \sqrt{5.0^2 + 4.0^2} \]
\[ NM = \sqrt{25.00 + 16.00} \]
\[ NM = \sqrt{41.00} \]
\[ NM \approx 6.4 \]

But the correct option given the choices is:
