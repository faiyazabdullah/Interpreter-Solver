====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the cosine function and its transformations. Let's analyze each option:

A: \(\cos(\pi + \theta)\)
Using the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(\pi + \theta) = -\cos(\theta)\). This is the correct opposite of \(\cos(\theta)\).

B: \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\)
Using the co-function identity, \(\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sin(\theta)\). This is not the opposite of \(\cos(\theta)\).

C: \(\cos(\pi - \theta)\)
Using the cosine subtraction identity, \(\cos(\pi - \theta) = -\cos(\theta)\). This is the correct opposite of \(\cos(\theta)\).

D: \(\cos(2\pi - \theta)\)
Using the periodicity and symmetry properties of cosine, \(\cos(2\pi - \theta) = \cos(-\theta) = \cos(\theta)\). This is not the opposite of \(\cos(\theta)\).

From the above analysis, the two options that are opposites of \(\cos(\theta)\) are A and C. However, since we need to choose two from the given options, we select the ones that correctly represent the opposite of \(\cos(\theta)\).
