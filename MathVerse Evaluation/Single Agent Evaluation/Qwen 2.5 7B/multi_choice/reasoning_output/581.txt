QUESTION:
For function graphed below, it passes (0,-2) and (3,0) and starts from (-1,-5). Determine if it has an inverse function.

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the function has an inverse, we need to check if the function is one-to-one (injective). A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. From the graph, it appears that the function is increasing and passes the horizontal line test, meaning it is one-to-one.

Since the function is one-to-one, it does have an inverse function.

Final Answer: A
