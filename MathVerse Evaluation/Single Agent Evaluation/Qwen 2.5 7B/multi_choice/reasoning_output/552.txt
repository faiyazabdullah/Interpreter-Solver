QUESTION:
Ashlynn models the relationship between the temperature $C$ of a hot cup of tea (in degrees Celsius) and time $T$ since the tea was poured into the cup (in minutes) as $C=20+20 \cdot 0.88^T$. The temperature decreases when time increases, and passes points(0, 40). She wanted to graph the relationship over the first half hour. Here is her work: What mistakes did Ashlynn make when drawing the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Inappropriate scale for $x$-axis
B:Inappropriate scale for $y$-axis
C:Wrong/missing label for $x$-axis
D:Wrong/missing label for $y$-axis
E:Ashlynn didn't make any mistake

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Ashlynn's graph appears to have an appropriate scale for both the x-axis and y-axis. However, the critical point here is that the graph does not have labels for the axes, which makes it difficult for someone to understand what each axis represents without additional context. This lack of labeling is a mistake.

Final Answer: C
