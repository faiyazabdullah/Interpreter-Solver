QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in the circle O with a radius of 2.0, C is a point on the extended line of the diameter AB, CD is tangent to the circle at point D. Connect AD, given that angle DAC = 30.0, the length of the line segment CD is ()

CHOICES:
A:1
B:√{3}
C:2
D:2√{3}

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for the length of CD, we need to use some geometric properties and the given information:

1. The radius of the circle is 2, so OD = 2.
2. Since CD is tangent to the circle at D, OD is perpendicular to CD, making ΔODC a right triangle.
3. Angle DAC is given as 30 degrees, which means angle ODC is also 30 degrees because OD is perpendicular to CD.
4. In a right triangle, if one of the non-right angles is 30 degrees, the side opposite that angle is half the hypotenuse. Therefore, OC = 2 * OD = 4 (since OD is the radius).
5. Using the Pythagorean theorem in ΔODC, where OC is the hypotenuse, OD is one leg, and CD is the other leg:
   \[
   OC^2 = OD^2 + CD^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   4^2 = 2^2 + CD^2
   \]
   \[
   16 = 4 + CD^2
   \]
   \[
   CD^2 = 12
   \]
   \[
   CD = \sqrt{12} = 2\sqrt{3}
   \]

Therefore, the length of the line segment CD is \(2\sqrt{3}\).

Final Answer: D
