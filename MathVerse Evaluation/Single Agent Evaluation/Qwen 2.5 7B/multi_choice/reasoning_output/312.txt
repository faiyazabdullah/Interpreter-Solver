QUESTION:
Two triangles have a shared vertex with three annotated points A, B, and C. Find the measure of \angle 2 if A B \perp B C.

CHOICES:
A:64
B:68
C:72
D:76

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \(\angle 2\), we need to analyze the given information and use geometric properties:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\angle ABC = 104^\circ\)
   - \(\angle ACB = 40^\circ\)
   - \(AB \perp BC\) (This means \(\angle ABC\) is a right angle, but it's not directly useful here since we don't have a right triangle involving \(\angle 2\)).

2. **Calculate \(\angle BAC\):**
   In \(\triangle ABC\), the sum of the interior angles is \(180^\circ\).
   \[
   \angle BAC = 180^\circ - \angle ABC - \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 104^\circ - 40^\circ = 36^\circ
   \]

3. **Analyze the configuration around point \(A\):**
   Since \(AB \perp BC\), \(\angle ABC = 90^\circ\). However, we see that \(\angle ABC = 104^\circ\) which is incorrect unless there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement. Assuming the perpendicularity is meant for another configuration, let's focus on \(\angle 2\).

4. **Identify \(\angle 2\):**
   \(\angle 2\) is part of \(\triangle ABD\) where \(D\) is on the line extending from \(BC\). Since \(\angle BAC = 36^\circ\) and considering the straight line properties, \(\angle 2\) can be calculated as:
   \[
   \angle 2 = 180^\circ - \angle BAC - \angle ADB = 180^\circ - 36^\circ - 104^\circ = 40^\circ
   \]
   
5. **Conclusion:**
   The measure of \(\angle 2\) is \(40^\circ\), but it seems there might be a misinterpretation in the problem setup. Given the options provided, the closest match is not listed. However, following the problem constraints and typical geometric interpretations, the closest reasonable answer is:
