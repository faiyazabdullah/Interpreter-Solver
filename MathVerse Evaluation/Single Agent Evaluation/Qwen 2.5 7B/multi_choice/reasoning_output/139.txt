QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, Xiaoqiang made a small hole imaging device in which the length of the paper tube is 15.0. He prepared a candle with a length of 20.0. To get an image with a height of 4.0, the distance between the candle and the paper tube should be ()

CHOICES:
A:60cm
B:65cm
C:70cm
D:75cm

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. The candle and its image form two similar triangles because the light rays from the candle pass through the pinhole and create an inverted image on the screen.

Given:
- The height of the candle (AB) = 20 cm
- The height of the image (BC) = 4 cm
- The length of the paper tube (AC) = 15 cm

We need to find the distance between the candle and the paper tube (AD).

Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of the candle}}{\text{Height of the image}} = \frac{\text{Distance from the candle to the pinhole}}{\text{Distance from the pinhole to the screen}}
\]

Let \( x \) be the distance from the candle to the pinhole (AD). Then, the distance from the pinhole to the screen (DC) will be \( 15 + x \).

So, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{20}{4} = \frac{x}{15 + x}
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
5 = \frac{x}{15 + x}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

\[
5(15 + x) = x
\]

\[
75 + 5x = x
\]

\[
75 = x - 5x
\]

\[
75 = 4x
\]

\[
x = \frac{75}{4}
\]

\[
x = 18.75
\]

Thus, the distance between the candle and the paper tube is \( 18.75 + 15 = 33.75 \) cm.

However, the closest answer choice to 33.75 cm is 35 cm, which is not provided in the choices. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the options given.

Given the choices:
A: 60 cm
B: 65 cm
C: 70 cm
D: 75 cm

The closest option to our calculated value is 70 cm.

Final Answer: C
