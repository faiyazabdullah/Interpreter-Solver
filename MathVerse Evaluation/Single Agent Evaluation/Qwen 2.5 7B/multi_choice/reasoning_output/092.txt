QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of circles and angles. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(AB\) is the diameter of circle \(O\).
   - \(C\) and \(D\) are points on the circle.
   - \(\angle D = 34^\circ\).

2. **Understand the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle:**
   - An inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - In this case, \(\angle D\) is an inscribed angle subtending arc \(AC\).
   - Therefore, the central angle \(\angle AOC\) (which subtends the same arc \(AC\)) is twice \(\angle D\):
     \[
     \angle AOC = 2 \times \angle D = 2 \times 34^\circ = 68^\circ.
     \]

3. **Calculate the measure of \(\angle BOC\):**
   - Since \(AB\) is the diameter, \(\angle AOB = 180^\circ\).
   - \(\angle BOC\) is the remaining angle in the semicircle when \(\angle AOC\) is subtracted from \(\angle AOB\):
     \[
     \angle BOC = 180^\circ - \angle AOC = 180^\circ - 68^\circ = 112^\circ.
     \]

Therefore, the degree of angle \(BOC\) is \(112^\circ\).
