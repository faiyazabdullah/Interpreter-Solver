To solve the problem, we need to use some properties of the incircle of a triangle and the angles formed by the tangents from the vertices to the points of tangency.

1. **Identify the key property**: The angle subtended by the arc \(DF\) at the point of tangency \(E\) (which is the center of the incircle) is related to the angle at the vertex \(A\) of the triangle.
2. **Understand the relationship**: The angle \(\angle DEF\) is half the difference of the angles at the base of the triangle opposite to the tangency points \(D\) and \(F\). Specifically, it is given that \(\angle DEF = 52^\circ\).
3. **Use the formula for the angle at the vertex**: In a triangle, the angle \(\angle A\) can be found using the relation \(\angle A = 180^\circ - (\angle B + \angle C)\), but here we use the property directly related to the incircle.

Given \(\angle DEF = 52^\circ\), the angle \(\angle A\) is twice this value because \(\angle DEF\) is half the angle at the vertex \(A\).

So, \(\angle A = 2 \times 52^\circ = 104^\circ\).

However, since \(\angle A\) is an interior angle of the triangle, the correct interpretation should be considering the supplementary angle to the angle formed by the tangents, which simplifies to finding the correct angle as \(180^\circ - 2 \times 52^\circ = 76^\circ\).

Thus, the correct answer is:
