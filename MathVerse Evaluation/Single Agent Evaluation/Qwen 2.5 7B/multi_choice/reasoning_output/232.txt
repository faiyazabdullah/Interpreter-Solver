QUESTION:
Two triangles W S R and T V R are similar. W S and V T are parallel. W S is 8, and V T is 10. Find W R.

CHOICES:
A:6
B:8
C:10
D:12

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of similar triangles and the fact that corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional.

Given:
- Triangles \( \triangle WSR \) and \( \triangle TVR \) are similar.
- \( WS = 8 \)
- \( VT = 10 \)
- \( WR = x + 6 \)
- \( RT = 2x + 6 \)

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of their corresponding sides are equal. Therefore:

\[
\frac{WS}{VT} = \frac{WR}{RT}
\]

Substitute the given values into the ratio equation:

\[
\frac{8}{10} = \frac{x + 6}{2x + 6}
\]

Simplify the fraction on the left side:

\[
\frac{4}{5} = \frac{x + 6}{2x + 6}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

\[
4(2x + 6) = 5(x + 6)
\]

Expand both sides:

\[
8x + 24 = 5x + 30
\]

Subtract \( 5x \) from both sides:

\[
3x + 24 = 30
\]

Subtract 24 from both sides:

\[
3x = 6
\]

Divide by 3:

\[
x = 2
\]

Now substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the expression for \( WR \):

\[
WR = x + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8
\]

Thus, the length of \( WR \) is 8.
