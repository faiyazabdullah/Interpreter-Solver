QUESTION:
Xuan Xuan and Kai Kai are in the same mathematics study group. In a math activity class, they each used a square piece of paper with a side length of 12.0 to make a pair of jigsaw puzzles, and cooperated to design the work shown in the picture. Help them calculate the sum of the area of the three figures circled in the figure, it is ()

CHOICES:
A:12cm
B:24cm
C:36cm
D:48cm

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the geometric figure:

1. The original square has a side length of 12 cm.
2. The square is divided into smaller triangles and other shapes.
3. We need to find the sum of the areas of the three circled figures.

Let's break down the figure:

- The square is divided into four smaller squares of equal size, each with a side length of 6 cm (half of 12 cm).
- Each smaller square is then further divided into two right triangles by a diagonal line.
- The circled figures appear to be the areas of these right triangles.

Since each smaller square is split into two identical right triangles, and there are four such smaller squares, we have eight right triangles in total.

However, only three of these triangles are circled. Each right triangle has a base and height of 6 cm, so the area of one right triangle is:

\[ \text{Area of one right triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 6 = 18 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Since there are three circled triangles, their combined area is:

\[ \text{Total area of the three circled triangles} = 3 \times 18 = 54 \text{ cm}^2 \]

This value does not match any of the provided answer choices, so we need to re-evaluate the problem or the choices. Given the options, the closest reasonable answer would be:
