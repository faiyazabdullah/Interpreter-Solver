QUESTION:
In the figure above, there is a triangle and two line segments in the figure, and the angle formed by the two segments is x. The two angles labeled in the figure are 55° and 75° respectively. What is the value of x?

CHOICES:
A.35
B.40
C.50
D.65
E.130

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \), we need to consider the sum of the interior angles of a triangle. In this case, the angles given are 55° and 75°, and we need to find the third angle, which is \( x \).

The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180°. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 55^\circ + 75^\circ + x = 180^\circ \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

1. Add the given angles:
   \[ 55^\circ + 75^\circ = 130^\circ \]

2. Subtract this sum from 180°:
   \[ 180^\circ - 130^\circ = 50^\circ \]

Thus, \( x = 50^\circ \).
