QUESTION:
For function graphed below, which is a curve whose asymptote is x-axis and x=4, determine if it has an inverse function.

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the function has an inverse, we need to check if the function is one-to-one (i.e., passes the horizontal line test). 

1. The graph shows a hyperbola with asymptotes at \( y = 0 \) and \( x = 4 \).
2. For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one.
3. The hyperbola appears to be symmetric about the origin and extends infinitely in both directions without repeating any \( y \)-values for distinct \( x \)-values except where the asymptote \( x = 4 \) is located.
4. The function seems to pass the horizontal line test since no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once except at the asymptote \( x = 4 \).

Since the function is one-to-one, it has an inverse.
