QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

Who is traveling faster?

CHOICES:
A:Justin
B:Oliver

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine who is traveling faster, we need to analyze the slopes of the two lines representing Oliver and Justin's progress in the race.

1. **Identify the slopes**:
   - The slope of a line can be calculated using the formula \( m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \).
   - For Oliver's line, the slope is approximately \( \frac{175 - 0}{5 - 0} = 35 \) (since it starts at the origin and reaches 175 at time 5).
   - For Justin's line, the slope is approximately \( \frac{125 - 0}{5 - 0} = 25 \).

2. **Compare the slopes**:
   - The slope for Oliver is 35.
   - The slope for Justin is 25.
   - Since the slope represents the rate of change (distance per unit time), a higher slope indicates a faster speed.

3. **Determine the faster traveler**:
   - Since Oliver has a higher slope, he is traveling faster than Justin.
