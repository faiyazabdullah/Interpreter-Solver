QUESTION:
This graph shows the relationship between the current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms) in an electrical circuit, when the voltage provided to the circuit is 240 V. The equation could be described as \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}}=\text{Current}

What happens to the current as the resistance increases?

CHOICES:
A:The current increases.
B:The current decreases.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given graph and the relationship it represents:

1. The graph shows the relationship between current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms).
2. The equation given is \( \text{Current} = \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}} \).

From the graph, we can observe:
- As the resistance increases, the current decreases.
- The curve is a hyperbola, which indicates an inverse relationship between current and resistance.

Given these observations, we can conclude that as the resistance increases, the current decreases.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
