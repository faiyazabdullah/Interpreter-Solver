QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening upward with a vertex of (3,âˆ’8) and a minimum value of -8. f(x)=x^2-2x+1. Which function has a greater y-intercept, f(x) or g(x)?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ has a greater $y$-intercept than $g$.
B:$g$ has a greater $y$-intercept than $f$.
C:$f$ and $g$ share the same $y$-intercept.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the y-intercepts of both functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

1. **Identify the y-intercept for \( f(x) \):**
   - The function \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 \).
   - The y-intercept occurs when \( x = 0 \).
   - Substitute \( x = 0 \) into \( f(x) \):
     \[
     f(0) = 0^2 - 2(0) + 1 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the y-intercept for \( f(x) \) is \( 1 \).

2. **Identify the y-intercept for \( g(x) \):**
   - From the graph of \( g(x) \), observe the point where the function crosses the y-axis.
   - The function \( g(x) \) appears to cross the y-axis at \( y = 1 \).

3. **Compare the y-intercepts:**
   - Both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) have the same y-intercept of \( 1 \).

Given the options provided:
- A: \( f \) has a greater \( y \)-intercept than \( g \)
- B: \( g \) has a greater \( y \)-intercept than \( f \)
- C: \( f \) and \( g \) share the same \( y \)-intercept

Since both functions have the same y-intercept, the correct answer is:
