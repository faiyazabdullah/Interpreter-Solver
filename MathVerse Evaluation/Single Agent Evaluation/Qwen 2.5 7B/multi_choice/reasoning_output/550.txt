QUESTION:
Elena knows that Lea has a garden with an area of 100 square meters. She does not know the specific width, $w$, and length, $l$ of the garden. The graph below represents the widths that correspond to possible lengths of Lea's garden, which decreases when $w$ increases and goes through (5,20), (10,10), (20,5). As the possible width of Lea's garden increases, what does its possible length approach?

CHOICES:
A:$\infty$
B:$\hline 0$
C:$\hline 10$
D:$\hline 120$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the graph and the relationship between the width \( w \) and the length \( l \).

1. The graph shows a curve where the length \( l \) decreases as the width \( w \) increases.
2. We know three points on the curve: (5, 20), (10, 10), and (20, 5).
3. The area of the garden is 100 square meters, so \( l \times w = 100 \).
4. From the graph, as \( w \) approaches infinity, the value of \( l \) approaches a certain limit. To find this limit, we can use the fact that \( l = \frac{100}{w} \).

As \( w \) becomes very large, \( \frac{100}{w} \) approaches 0. Therefore, the possible length \( l \) approaches 0.
