QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, a parallel b, angle 1 = 158.0, angle 2 = 42.0, angle 4 = 50.0. Then angle 3 = ()

CHOICES:
A:50°
B:60°
C:70°
D:80°

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for angle 3, we need to use the properties of parallel lines and the sum of angles around a point.

Step 1: Identify the given angles and their relationships.
- Angle 1 = 158°
- Angle 2 = 42°
- Angle 4 = 50°

Step 2: Determine the relationship between angles 1 and 2.
Since lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel, angle 1 and angle 2 form a linear pair (they are supplementary). Therefore, they add up to 180°.
\[ \text{Angle 1} + \text{Angle 2} = 158° + 42° = 200° \]
However, since they should be supplementary, we can deduce that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem setup as the angles provided do not align perfectly with the properties of parallel lines and supplementary angles directly.

Step 3: Determine the relationship between angle 3 and angle 4.
Since lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel, angle 3 and angle 4 are corresponding angles, which means they are equal.
\[ \text{Angle 3} = \text{Angle 4} = 50° \]

Step 4: Verify the calculation.
Given the problem constraints and the options provided, it seems that the angles provided might need re-evaluation or the problem might have a different configuration than initially thought.

Given the options and the problem constraints, the closest reasonable answer is:
