To solve this problem, let's use the properties of circles and angles.

1. We know that OC is perpendicular to AB, so OC bisects AB into two equal parts. This means that triangle AOB is isosceles with OA = OB (both are radii of the circle).

2. Since OC is perpendicular to AB, it creates two right angles at points where OC intersects AB. This implies that angle ACO = angle BCO = 90°.

3. Given that angle ABC = 25°, we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point O is 360°. Since OA = OB, triangle AOB is isosceles, and the base angles (angle OAB and angle OBA) are equal.

4. Let's denote the measure of angle OAB as x. Since the sum of angles in triangle AOB is 180°, we have:
   \[
   \text{angle OAB} + \text{angle OBA} + \text{angle AOB} = 180°
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   x + x + \text{angle AOB} = 180°
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   2x + \text{angle AOB} = 180°
   \]

5. Since angle OAB is formed by the bisector of angle ABC and the radius OA, we can infer that angle OAB is half of angle ACB because OC is perpendicular to AB and bisects it. Therefore, angle OAB = 2 * angle ABC = 2 * 25° = 50°.
   
6. Substituting x = 50° into our equation:
   \[
   2(50°) + \text{angle AOB} = 180°
   \]
   \[
   100° + \text{angle AOB} = 180°
   \]
   Solving for angle AOB:
   \[
   \text{angle AOB} = 180° - 100° = 80°
   \]

Thus, the size of angle AOB is 80°.
