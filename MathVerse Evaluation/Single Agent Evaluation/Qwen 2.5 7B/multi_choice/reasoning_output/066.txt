QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of parallel lines and the angles formed by a transversal.

1. Since AB is parallel to CD and BE and ED are transversals, we can use the fact that corresponding angles are equal.
2. Angle B is given as 20 degrees. Because AB is parallel to CD, angle BED (which is an exterior angle) will be equal to the sum of the two interior angles on the same side of the transversal that are adjacent to it.
3. Angle D is given as 60 degrees. The sum of the angles on a straight line is 180 degrees. Therefore, the remaining angle on the straight line (angle BED) is 180 - (20 + 60) = 100 degrees.

So, the measure of angle BED is 100 degrees.
