QUESTION:
For the pair of similar figures in blue and green, use the given areas to find x.

CHOICES:
A:1
B:2
C:8
D:16

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \), we need to use the fact that the figures are similar, which means their corresponding sides are proportional. The area ratio of two similar figures is equal to the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

Given:
- Area of the smaller rectangle (blue) = 8 in²
- Area of the larger rectangle (green) = 32 in²
- Length of the smaller rectangle = 4 in

Let's denote the length of the larger rectangle as \( x \).

Since the areas are proportional to the squares of the lengths, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{32}{8}
\]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{x}{4}\right)^2 = 4
\]

Take the square root of both sides:

\[
\frac{x}{4} = 2
\]

Multiply both sides by 4:

\[
x = 8
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is 8.
