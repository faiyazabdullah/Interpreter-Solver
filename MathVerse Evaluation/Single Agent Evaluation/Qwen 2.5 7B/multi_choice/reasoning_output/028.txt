QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the geometric configuration and use trigonometric properties.

Given:
- \( \triangle ABC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).
- \( \triangle ABD \) is an equilateral triangle with \( AB \) as the common side.
- We need to find the size of \( \angle CAB \) when \( CD \) is the longest.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   - Since \( \triangle ABD \) is equilateral, \( \angle DAB = \angle ABD = 60^\circ \).
   - In \( \triangle ABC \), since it's a right triangle at \( C \), \( \angle CAB + \angle ABC = 90^\circ \).

2. **Positioning Points:**
   - Place point \( C \) such that \( CD \) is maximized. This typically occurs when \( C \) is directly opposite \( D \) along the circumcircle of \( \triangle ABD \) (since \( \triangle ABD \) is equilateral).

3. **Using Trigonometry:**
   - When \( C \) is positioned such that \( CD \) is maximized, consider the symmetry and the fact that \( \triangle ABD \) is equilateral. The angle \( \angle CAB \) will be such that it forms the longest possible path \( CD \).

4. **Calculate \( \angle CAB \):**
   - Given the symmetry and properties of the equilateral triangle and the right triangle, the optimal position for \( C \) is when \( \angle CAB = 45^\circ \). This makes \( \triangle ABC \) a 45-45-90 triangle with \( \angle CAB = 45^\circ \).

Thus, the size of \( \angle CAB \) when \( CD \) is the largest is \( 45^\circ \).
