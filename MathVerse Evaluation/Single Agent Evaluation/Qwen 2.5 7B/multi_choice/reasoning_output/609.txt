QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What does the average rate of change tell you?

CHOICES:
A:An increase in demand of 500 units will decrease the price of each toy by $\$ 1$
B:An increase in demand of 500 units will increase the price of each toy by $\$ 1$
C:The price of each toy increases by $\$ 0.50$ for each additional 1000 units demanded
D:The price of each toy decreases by $\$ 0.50$ for each additional 1000 units demanded

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the average rate of change, we need to calculate the slope of the line between the two points shown on the graph.

1. Identify the coordinates of the two points:
   - Point 1: (5, 17)
   - Point 2: (15, 22)

2. Use the formula for the slope \( m \):
   \[
   m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]

3. Substitute the coordinates into the formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{22 - 17}{15 - 5} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
   \]

The slope of the line is 0.5, which means the price increases by $0.50 for each additional 1000 units demanded.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
