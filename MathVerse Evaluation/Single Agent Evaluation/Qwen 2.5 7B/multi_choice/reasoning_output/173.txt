QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, it is known that AB and AD are the chords of circle O, angle BOD = 50.0, then the degree of angle BAD is ()

CHOICES:
A:50째
B:40째
C:25째
D:35째

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of circles and the relationship between central angles and inscribed angles.

1. The central angle BOD is given as 50 degrees.
2. The inscribed angle BAD intercepts the same arc BD as the central angle BOD.
3. According to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that intercepts the same arc.

Therefore, the measure of angle BAD is:
\[ \text{Angle BAD} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Angle BOD} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50^\circ = 25^\circ \]

Thus, the degree of angle BAD is 25 degrees.

Final Answer: C
