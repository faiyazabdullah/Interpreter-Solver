QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex of (-5,6). f(x)=4x^2-108. Do the functions have the same concavity, f(x) and g(x)?

CHOICES:
A:Yes, $f$ and $g$ are both concave down.
B:Yes, $f$ and $g$ are both concave up.
C:No, $f$ is concave up and $g$ is concave down.
D:No, $f$ is concave down and $g$ is concave up.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine whether the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) have the same concavity, we need to analyze their respective parabolas.

1. **Examine \( f(x) = 4x^2 - 108 \):**
   - This is a standard form of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \).
   - Here, \( a = 4 \), which is positive.
   - Since \( a > 0 \), the parabola opens upwards, meaning it is concave up.

2. **Examine \( g(x) \):**
   - The vertex of \( g(x) \) is given as \( (-5, 6) \).
   - Since the parabola opens downwards (as it is given that the function is quadratic and opens downward), the coefficient \( a \) must be negative.
   - Therefore, \( g(x) \) is also concave up because its parabola opens downwards.

Given that both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) open upwards, they both have the same concavity.
