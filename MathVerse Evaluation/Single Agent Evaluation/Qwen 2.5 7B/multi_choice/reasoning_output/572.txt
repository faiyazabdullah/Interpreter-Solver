QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex of (-8,8). f(x)=-5(x+4)^2+8. Which function has a greater maximum?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ has a greater maximum than $g$.
B:$g$ has a greater maximum than $f$.
C:$f$ and $g$ share the same maximum.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to compare the maximum values of the functions \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \).

1. **Examine the graph of \( g(x) \)**:
   - The graph shows a parabola that opens downward with its vertex at \( (-8, 8) \).
   - Therefore, the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 8.

2. **Analyze the function \( f(x) \)**:
   - The function \( f(x) = -5(x+4)^2 + 8 \) is also a parabola that opens downward because the coefficient of the squared term is negative.
   - The vertex form of \( f(x) \) indicates that the vertex is at \( x = -4 \), and the y-coordinate of the vertex is 8.
   - Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x) \) is also 8.

Since both \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) have the same maximum value of 8, they share the same maximum.
