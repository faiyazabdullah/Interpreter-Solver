To solve the problem, we need to use some geometric properties and theorems. Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Identify Key Properties:**
   - \( \angle OAC = 30^\circ \)
   - \( OA = OB = OC = 2 \) (radius of the circle)
   - \( PC \) is a tangent to the circle at \( C \), so \( \angle OPC = 90^\circ \)

2. **Determine \( \angle OCP \):**
   Since \( OC \) is a radius and \( PC \) is tangent, \( \angle OCP = 90^\circ \).

3. **Find \( \angle AOC \):**
   In triangle \( OAC \), since \( \angle OAC = 30^\circ \) and \( OA = OC \) (both radii), \( \triangle OAC \) is isosceles. Therefore, \( \angle ACO = \angle CAO = 30^\circ \). So, \( \angle AOC = 180^\circ - 30^\circ - 30^\circ = 120^\circ \).

4. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:**
   According to the Power of a Point theorem, for a point \( P \) outside a circle, the power of the point is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments of the secant from the point to the points of intersection, and also equal to the square of the length of the tangent segment from the point to the circle.
   Here, \( PC^2 = PA \cdot PB \).

5. **Calculate \( PC \):**
   Since \( \angle OPC = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle OPC \) is a right triangle. We can use trigonometric identities to find \( PC \).
   In \( \triangle OCP \), \( \angle OCP = 90^\circ \), \( \angle COP = 60^\circ \) (since \( \angle AOC = 120^\circ \) and \( \angle AOP = 90^\circ \)), and \( \angle POC = 30^\circ \).
   Using the tangent function in \( \triangle OCP \):
   \[
   PC = OC \cdot \tan(60^\circ) = 2 \cdot \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}
   \]

Therefore, the length of \( PC \) is \( 2\sqrt{3} \).
