QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the straight line AD parallel BC, if angle 1 = 42.0, angle BAC = 78.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()

CHOICES:
A:42°
B:50°
C:60°
D:68°

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of parallel lines and the angles formed by them with transversals.

1. Given that \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(\angle 1 = 42^\circ\).
2. Since \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle BAC\) are corresponding angles. Therefore, they are equal.
3. We know \(\angle BAC = 78^\circ\).

Since \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle BAC\) are corresponding angles, we have:
\[
\angle 2 = \angle BAC = 78^\circ
\]

However, this does not match any of the provided options. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation:

Given \(\angle 1 = 42^\circ\) and using the property of linear pairs (angles on a straight line sum up to \(180^\circ\)):
\[
\angle BAC + \angle 1 = 180^\circ
\]
\[
78^\circ + 42^\circ = 120^\circ
\]

This indicates there might be a misinterpretation or a different approach needed. Let's consider the alternate angles formed by the transversal intersecting the parallel lines:

Since \(\angle 2\) and \(\angle BAC\) are supplementary when considering the straight line, let’s reconsider the angle relationships again:

Given \(\angle 1 = 42^\circ\), and knowing \(\angle BAC = 78^\circ\):
\[
\angle 2 = 180^\circ - 78^\circ = 102^\circ
\]

This still does not match the options. Rechecking the problem constraints and options:

Given \(\angle 1 = 42^\circ\), and considering the options, it seems the correct interpretation should be:
\[
\angle 2 = 180^\circ - 120^\circ = 60^\circ
\]

Thus, the correct angle is:
