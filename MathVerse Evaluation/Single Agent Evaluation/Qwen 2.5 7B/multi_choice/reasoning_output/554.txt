QUESTION:
A polynomial $p$ is graphed, which goes through (-2.5,0), (-1,0), (3,0). What could be the equation of $p$ ?

CHOICES:
A:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)^2(x-3)^2$
B:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)(x-3)^2$
C:$p(x)=(x+1)^2(2 x+5)(x-3)$
D:$p(x)=(x+1)(2 x+5)(x-3)^2$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the equation of the polynomial \( p(x) \), we need to consider the roots provided by the x-intercepts of the graph. The polynomial must have roots at \( x = -2.5 \), \( x = -1 \), and \( x = 3 \).

Given these roots, the polynomial can be expressed in the form:

\[ p(x) = k(x + 2.5)(x + 1)(x - 3) \]

However, the problem specifies that the polynomial should pass through specific points, and we need to match it with one of the given options. Let's analyze the given options to find the correct one:

A: \( p(x) = (x + 1)^2 (2x + 5)^2 (x - 3)^2 \)
B: \( p(x) = (x + 1)^2 (2x + 5) (x - 3)^2 \)
C: \( p(x) = (x + 1)^2 (2x + 5) (x - 3) \)
D: \( p(x) = (x + 1) (2x + 5) (x - 3)^2 \)

We need to check which of these polynomials has the same roots as the given polynomial form but matches the given options. 

By comparing the roots and the structure of each option, we can see that option C matches our derived form:

\[ p(x) = (x + 1)^2 (2x + 5) (x - 3) \]

This polynomial has the roots \( x = -1 \), \( x = -\frac{5}{2} \), and \( x = 3 \), which are consistent with the x-intercepts of the graph.
