QUESTION:
Two curves are symmetrical about the x-axis. Use the vertical line test to determine if this relation is a function.

CHOICES:
A:This is a function
B:This is not a function

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the relation is a function, we need to use the vertical line test. This test states that for every vertical line drawn on the graph, it should intersect the curve at most once. If a vertical line intersects the curve more than once, then the relation is not a function.

From the image, observe the curve:

1. Draw a vertical line at any point on the x-axis.
2. Check how many times this vertical line intersects the curve.

In the image, there appears to be a vertical line passing through the y-axis (x=0) which intersects the curve twice. This indicates that for a certain x-value, there are two corresponding y-values, which violates the definition of a function.

Therefore, the relation is not a function.

Final Answer: B
