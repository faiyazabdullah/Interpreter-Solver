To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the ladder AB. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \( BC = 1.6 \) meters (distance from the base of the ladder to the wall).
   - \( DE = 1.4 \) meters (distance from the wall where the ladder touches the ground).
   - \( BD = 0.55 \) meters (length of the segment from B to D).

2. **Understand the geometry:**
   - Since \( DE \perp BC \) and \( AB \) is the ladder, \( AE \) is the height from the top of the ladder to the ground.
   - \( \triangle ADE \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) because they both have a right angle at \( E \) and \( C \) respectively, and share the angle at \( A \).

3. **Calculate \( AE \):**
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ADE \):
     \[
     AD^2 = AE^2 + DE^2
     \]
     \[
     AD^2 = 1.4^2 + (1.6 - 0.55)^2
     \]
     \[
     AD^2 = 1.96 + 1.05^2
     \]
     \[
     AD^2 = 1.96 + 1.1025
     \]
     \[
     AD^2 = 3.0625
     \]
     \[
     AD = \sqrt{3.0625} = 1.75
     \]

4. **Calculate \( AE \):**
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABE \):
     \[
     AB^2 = AE^2 + BE^2
     \]
     \[
     AB^2 = 1.75^2 + 1.6^2
     \]
     \[
     AB^2 = 3.0625 + 2.56
     \]
     \[
     AB^2 = 5.6225
     \]
     \[
     AB = \sqrt{5.6225} = 2.37
     \]

5. **Compare with the answer choices:**
   - The closest value to 2.37 meters among the given options is 2.40 meters.

Therefore, the length of the ladder is approximately 2.40 meters, which corresponds to option C.
