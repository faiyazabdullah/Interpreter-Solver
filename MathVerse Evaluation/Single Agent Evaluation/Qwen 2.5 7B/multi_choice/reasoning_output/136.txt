QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to measure the degree of tree AB, a certain mathematics learning interest group measured the length of the tree's shadow BC in the sun as 9.0. At the same moment, they also measured the shadow length of Xiaoliang in the sun as 1.5. Knowing that Xiaoliang's height is 1.8, then the height of tree AB is ()

CHOICES:
A:10.8m
B:9m
C:7.5m
D:0.3m

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. The height of the tree (AB) and its shadow (BC) are proportional to the height of Xiaoliang and his shadow.

Given:
- Length of tree's shadow (BC) = 9.0 meters
- Height of Xiaoliang = 1.8 meters
- Length of Xiaoliang's shadow (CD) = 1.5 meters

We can set up the proportion:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of tree}}{\text{Length of tree's shadow}} = \frac{\text{Height of Xiaoliang}}{\text{Length of Xiaoliang's shadow}}
\]

Substitute the known values into the proportion:
\[
\frac{AB}{9} = \frac{1.8}{1.5}
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1.8}{1.5} = 1.2
\]

Now, solve for AB:
\[
AB = 1.2 \times 9 = 10.8
\]

Therefore, the height of the tree AB is 10.8 meters.

Final Answer: A
