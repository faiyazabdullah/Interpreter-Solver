QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (0,0) and the value of y increases by the increase of the value of x, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the function has an inverse, we need to check if the function is one-to-one. A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. This is known as the horizontal line test.

1. Examine the graph: The graph is a smooth curve that starts from the origin (0,0) and increases as x increases.
2. Apply the horizontal line test: Draw horizontal lines across the graph. Notice that each horizontal line intersects the graph at most once.

Since the horizontal line test is satisfied, the function is one-to-one and thus has an inverse.
