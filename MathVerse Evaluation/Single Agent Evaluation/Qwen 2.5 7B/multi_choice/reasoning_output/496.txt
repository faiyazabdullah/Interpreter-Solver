QUESTION:
There is a quadratic function, which goes through (0,0), (20,0) and opens upward. Determine whether the graph represents a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A.This is a one-to-one function
B.This is not a one-to-one function

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the graph represents a one-to-one function, we need to check if the function passes the horizontal line test. A function is one-to-one if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once.

1. The graph shows a parabola that opens upwards.
2. The parabola intersects the x-axis at two points: (0, 0) and (20, 0).
3. Since the parabola intersects the horizontal line y = 0 at two different x-values (0 and 20), it fails the horizontal line test.
4. Therefore, the function is not one-to-one.

Final Answer: B
