QUESTION:
In triangle X Y Z, Z W and W Y are equal. X W is perpendicular to Z Y. X Y and X Z are 18 + 2y and 5y - 6, respectively. Find X Z.

CHOICES:
A:5
B:17
C:18
D:34

====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information:

1. \( XW \) is perpendicular to \( ZY \).
2. \( XZ = 5y - 6 \).
3. \( XY = 18 + 2y \).

Since \( XW \perp ZY \), triangle \( XYZ \) is a right triangle at \( W \). This means we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between \( XZ \), \( XY \), and \( XW \).

However, since \( XW \perp ZY \), the lengths \( XZ \) and \( XY \) should form the legs of the right triangle, and the hypotenuse would be \( XW \). But here, we need to find \( XZ \).

Given the choices:
A: 5
B: 17
C: 18
D: 34

We need to check which value fits the condition. Since \( XZ = 5y - 6 \) and we don't have the specific value of \( y \), we can assume the simplest scenario where the equation holds true for one of the given options.

By checking the options:
- If \( XZ = 5 \), then \( 5y - 6 = 5 \implies 5y = 11 \implies y = \frac{11}{5} \).
- If \( XZ = 17 \), then \( 5y - 6 = 17 \implies 5y = 23 \implies y = \frac{23}{5} \).
- If \( XZ = 18 \), then \( 5y - 6 = 18 \implies 5y = 24 \implies y = \frac{24}{5} \).
- If \( XZ = 34 \), then \( 5y - 6 = 34 \implies 5y = 40 \implies y = 8 \).

Among these, \( y = 8 \) seems the most straightforward and fits the simplest integer solution.

So, the value of \( XZ \) is 34.
