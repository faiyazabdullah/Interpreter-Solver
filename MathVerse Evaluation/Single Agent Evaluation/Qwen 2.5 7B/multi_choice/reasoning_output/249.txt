D:123

====================================================================================================
To solve for \(\angle CFD\) in \(\odot F\) with diameter \(AC\), we need to use the fact that the angle subtended by an arc at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended at any point on the circumference. 

Given:
- \(\angle BFC = 72^\circ\)
- \(\angle AFD = (4a - 1)^\circ\)
- \(\angle ADF = (2a - 5)^\circ\)

Since \(F\) is the center of the circle and \(AC\) is the diameter, \(\angle ACF\) and \(\angle ADF\) are inscribed angles subtending the same arc \(AD\). Therefore, \(\angle ACF = 2 \times \angle ADF\).

Let's find \(\angle ADF\):
\[ 2a - 5 = \angle ADF \]

Now, since \(\angle BFC\) is the central angle subtending the same arc as \(\angle ACF\):
\[ \angle ACF = 2 \times 72^\circ = 144^\circ \]

Using the fact that the sum of angles around a point is \(360^\circ\):
\[ \angle ACF + \angle ADF + \angle CFD = 180^\circ \]
\[ 144^\circ + (2a - 5)^\circ + \angle CFD = 180^\circ \]

Solving for \(\angle CFD\):
\[ \angle CFD = 180^\circ - 144^\circ - (2a - 5)^\circ \]
\[ \angle CFD = 36^\circ - 2a + 5 \]
\[ \angle CFD = 41^\circ - 2a \]

However, we need to check the given options. Let's assume there was a misinterpretation and recheck the problem setup. Given the options, let's assume the correct interpretation involves the correct values for \(a\).

By checking the options, the closest value that fits is:
