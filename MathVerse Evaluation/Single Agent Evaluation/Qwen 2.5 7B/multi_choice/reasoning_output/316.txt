QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's use the properties of similar triangles and parallel lines.

Given:
- Triangles AEB and ADC are similar.
- EB âˆ¥ DC.
- AB = x - 2.
- BC = 5.

Since triangles AEB and ADC are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{EB}{DC} \]

We know:
\[ AD = AE + ED = 10 + 4 = 14 \]
\[ EB = x - 2 \]
\[ DC = BC = 5 \]

Substituting these values into the proportionality equation:

\[ \frac{x - 2}{14} = \frac{x - 2}{5} \]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[ 5(x - 2) = 14(x - 2) \]

Expanding both sides:

\[ 5x - 10 = 14x - 28 \]

Rearranging terms to isolate \(x\):

\[ 10 = 9x - 28 \]
\[ 38 = 9x \]
\[ x = \frac{38}{9} \approx 4.22 \]

However, none of the provided answer choices match this value. Let's recheck the setup and calculation to ensure there's no error. Given the options, it seems there might be a simpler relationship or a misinterpretation of the problem setup.

Upon re-evaluating the problem, it appears the correct interpretation should lead to a simpler solution. Let's try a different approach:

Given the similarity and parallel lines, we can use the property that corresponding sides are proportional:

\[ \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{DC} \]

Substituting known values:

\[ \frac{x - 2}{14} = \frac{5}{5} \]
\[ \frac{x - 2}{14} = 1 \]
\[ x - 2 = 14 \]
\[ x = 16 \]

But again, this does not match the provided choices. Rechecking the problem statement and options, it seems the closest logical fit is:
