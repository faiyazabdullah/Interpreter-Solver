QUESTION:
Two triangles G J I and G K H are similar with a shared vertex G. K H and J I are parallel. Find K J if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4.

CHOICES:
A:2
B:4
C:6
D:8

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of similar triangles and the fact that the segments are proportional due to the parallel lines.

Given:
- Triangles GJI and GKJ are similar.
- GH = 12, HI = 4.
- GJ = 8.

Since the triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are proportional. Specifically, the ratio of the sides in triangle GJI to triangle GKJ is the same as the ratio of the sides in triangle GHJ to triangle GKH.

We can set up the proportion based on the sides:
\[ \frac{GJ}{GH} = \frac{KJ}{HI} \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ \frac{8}{12} = \frac{KJ}{4} \]

Simplify the fraction on the left side:
\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{KJ}{4} \]

Now, solve for KJ by cross-multiplying:
\[ 2 \cdot 4 = 3 \cdot KJ \]
\[ 8 = 3KJ \]
\[ KJ = \frac{8}{3} \approx 2.67 \]

Since the closest answer choice to 2.67 is 2, we select:

Final Answer: A
