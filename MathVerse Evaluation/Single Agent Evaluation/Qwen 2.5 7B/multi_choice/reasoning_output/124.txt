QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, cut a circle and a sector piece of paper on the paper so that it can form a cone model. If the radius of the circle is 1.0 and the central angle of the sector is equal to 90.0, then the radius of the sector is ()

CHOICES:
A:2

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to understand how a circle and a sector can be used to form a cone.

1. **Identify the components:**
   - The radius of the circle (which will be the base of the cone) is 1.
   - The central angle of the sector is 90 degrees.
   - We need to find the radius of the sector (which will be the slant height of the cone).

2. **Understand the relationship between the sector and the cone:**
   - When the sector is cut out and folded into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
   - The circumference of the base of the cone is \(2 \pi \times 1 = 2 \pi\).
   - The arc length of the sector is \(\frac{90}{360} \times 2 \pi \times R = \frac{1}{4} \times 2 \pi \times R = \frac{\pi R}{2}\), where \(R\) is the radius of the sector.
   - This arc length should equal the circumference of the base of the cone, so \(\frac{\pi R}{2} = 2 \pi\).

3. **Solve for \(R\):**
   \[
   \frac{\pi R}{2} = 2 \pi
   \]
   \[
   R = 4
   \]

Therefore, the radius of the sector is 4.
