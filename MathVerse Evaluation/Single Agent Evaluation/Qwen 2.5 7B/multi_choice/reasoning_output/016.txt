Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. We have a circle with center \( O \).
2. Chord \( AC \) is parallel to radius \( OB \).
3. Angle \( BOC = 50^\circ \).

First, we need to find the measure of angle \( OAC \). Since \( AC \) is parallel to \( OB \), and \( OB \) is a radius, the perpendicular from \( O \) to \( AC \) will bisect \( AC \) (i.e., it is the perpendicular bisector of \( AC \)). Therefore, triangle \( OAC \) is isosceles with \( OA = OC \).

Next, consider the central angle \( BOC \). Since \( OB \) is a radius and \( AC \) is parallel to \( OB \), the perpendicular from \( O \) to \( AC \) creates two congruent triangles when extended to \( A \) and \( C \). Thus, the angle subtended by arc \( BC \) at the circumference (which is half the central angle \( BOC \)) is \( 25^\circ \).

Since \( OA = OC \), angle \( OAC \) is equal to angle \( OCA \). In triangle \( OAC \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, each of these angles is \( 75^\circ / 2 = 37.5^\circ \).

However, since we need the measure of angle \( OAB \), we look at the triangle \( OAB \). Given the symmetry and the properties of the circle, angle \( OAB \) is half of angle \( BOC \), which is \( 25^\circ \).

Thus, the measure of angle \( OAB \) is \( 25^\circ \).
