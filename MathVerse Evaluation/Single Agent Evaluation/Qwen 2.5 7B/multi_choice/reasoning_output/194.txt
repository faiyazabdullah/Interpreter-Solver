QUESTION:
Put the ruler, the triangle ruler and the round nut on the desktop as shown in the figure, angle CAB = 60.0, if AD = 6.0, then the outer diameter of the round nut is ()

CHOICES:
A:12cm
B:24cm
C:6√{3}cm
D:12√{3}cm

====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the outer diameter of the round nut using the given information.

1. We know that angle CAB = 60 degrees.
2. AD = 6 cm.
3. The round nut is tangent to the ruler at point D.

Since the round nut is tangent to the ruler at point D, the distance from the center of the round nut to the ruler is equal to the radius of the round nut. Let's denote the radius of the round nut by r.

In the right triangle ACD, we can use trigonometric relationships. Since angle CAD = 60 degrees, we can use the cosine function:

\[ \cos(60^\circ) = \frac{AD}{AC} \]
\[ \cos(60^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} \]

So,

\[ \frac{6}{AC} = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ AC = 12 \]

Now, we need to find the length of AB. In the right triangle ABC, we can use the sine function:

\[ \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{BC}{AB} \]
\[ \sin(60^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Since BC = AC (because the round nut is tangent to the ruler at point D and the radius is perpendicular to the tangent), we have:

\[ BC = 12 \]

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABC:

\[ AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 144 + 144 \]
\[ AB^2 = 288 \]
\[ AB = \sqrt{288} = 12\sqrt{2} \]

Now, the outer diameter of the round nut is twice the radius, so:

\[ \text{Outer diameter} = 2r \]

Since the radius r is half of the distance from A to the point where the nut is tangent to the ruler, and the distance from A to the point of tangency is 6 cm, the radius r is:

\[ r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

Therefore, the outer diameter is:

\[ 2r = 2 \times 3 = 6 \sqrt{3} \]

The correct answer is:
