QUESTION:
Fold a rectangular piece of paper with equal width as shown in the figure. If angle 1 = 140.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()

CHOICES:
A:100°
B:110°
C:120°
D:140°

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given angles and their relationships within the folded paper.

1. **Examine the given angle**: Angle 1 is 140°.
2. **Understand the fold**: When a rectangular piece of paper is folded, the angles around the fold will be equal. Since the fold creates two equal angles on either side of the fold, let's denote the angle on the other side of the fold as angle 2.
3. **Sum of angles on a straight line**: The sum of angles on a straight line is 180°. Therefore, the sum of angle 1 and angle 2 must be 180° because they form a straight line when the paper is folded.

\[ \text{Angle 1} + \text{Angle 2} = 180° \]

4. **Substitute the known value**:

\[ 140° + \text{Angle 2} = 180° \]

5. **Solve for Angle 2**:

\[ \text{Angle 2} = 180° - 140° \]
\[ \text{Angle 2} = 40° \]

However, since the angles are formed due to folding, the actual angle on the other side (angle 2) will be the supplement of 140° minus its own reflection across the fold, which effectively doubles the angle difference:

\[ \text{Angle 2} = 180° - 140° = 40° \]
But considering the reflection, it effectively makes angle 2 180° - 140° = 40°, but the correct interpretation should be 180° - 40° = 140°.

Thus, the correct answer is:
