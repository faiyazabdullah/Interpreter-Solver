To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of congruent triangles and the sum of angles in a triangle.

1. Since triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF, the corresponding angles are equal.
   - Angle B in triangle ABC is 45 degrees, so angle D in triangle DEF is also 45 degrees.
   - Angle F in triangle DEF is 65 degrees, so angle E in triangle ABC is also 65 degrees.

2. The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees.
   - For triangle ABC: Angle A + Angle B + Angle C = 180 degrees.
   - Given Angle B = 45 degrees and Angle C = 65 degrees, we can find Angle A:
     \[
     Angle A = 180 - 45 - 65 = 70 \text{ degrees}
     \]

3. Now, consider the straight line segment BECF. The exterior angle at point O (which lies on the straight line) is the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.
   - The angle COE is the exterior angle at O formed by the intersection of lines AC and DF.
   - The angles around point O form a complete circle, which is 360 degrees.

4. Since angle AOC is an exterior angle for triangle ABC and angle DOF is an exterior angle for triangle DEF, they are supplementary to their respective interior angles.
   - Therefore, angle COE is the sum of these exterior angles minus the straight line segment.
   - Angle COE = 180 - (angle A + angle D) = 180 - (70 + 45) = 65 degrees.

However, this is incorrect as we need to re-evaluate the straight line and the angles around it. The correct approach is to recognize that the sum of the angles around point O on a straight line is 180 degrees minus the supplementary angles.

5. The correct calculation for angle COE should be:
   - Angle COE = 180 - (angle A + angle D) = 180 - (70 + 45) = 65 degrees.

But since the angles are supplementary, the correct calculation is:
Angle COE = 180 - (70 + 45) = 65 degrees.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
