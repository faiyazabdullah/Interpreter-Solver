ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 378
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$y = 4\sqrt{5}$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
4\sqrt{5}

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is $y = 4\sqrt{5}$ and the original answer is $4\sqrt{5}$.
The LLM answer includes the variable $y$, so we need to consider if this changes the answer. In this case, the original answer is an expression and the LLM answer is an equation stating that $y$ is equal to the expression.
However, the problem asks to compare the two answers and determine if they represent the same mathematical result.
In this case, they are equivalent if we are simply solving for $y$ and we are given that $y=4\sqrt{5}$.

NUMERICAL EQUIVALENCE:
Both answers have the same numerical value, which is $4\sqrt{5}$.

MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS:
The LLM answer is an equation while the original is an expression. However, if we solve for $y$ we get $y = 4\sqrt{5}$.

Therefore, the two answers represent the same mathematical result.
