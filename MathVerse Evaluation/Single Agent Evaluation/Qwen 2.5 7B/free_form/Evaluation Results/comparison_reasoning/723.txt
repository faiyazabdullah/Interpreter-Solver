The LLM generated answer is a description of the volume remaining, but it does not provide a formula. The original answer is a mathematical expression for the volume of water remaining in the tank: 63πx³+66πx²+15πx litres.

Let's consider if it is possible for the LLM answer to be equivalent to the original answer. The LLM answer states the volume of water remaining in the tank after \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds. This implies that \((2x + 2)^2\) is the input variable into the expression for volume. If we set \((2x+2)^2 = t\), where \(t\) is the time in seconds, then we want to express \(63\pi x^3+66\pi x^2+15\pi x\) in terms of \(t\). Solving \((2x+2)^2 = t\) for \(x\), we have \(2x+2 = \sqrt{t}\), \(2x = \sqrt{t}-2\), \(x = \frac{\sqrt{t}-2}{2}\).
Substituting this expression for \(x\) into the volume equation gives us a complicated expression in terms of \(t\), which is unlikely to simplify into something concise.

Since the LLM did not provide a specific mathematical expression, and we can see that the correct answer is a complex polynomial, it is highly unlikely that they are equivalent. The LLM's answer simply states the volume of water remaining in the tank after a certain amount of time. It does not give a way to calculate it, unlike the original answer.

Therefore, the LLM's answer and the original answer are not equivalent.
