ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 482
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$\text{Domain: } [2, 8], \quad \text{Range: } [6, 8]$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$\text{Domain: } (2, 8],\quad \text{Range: } [6, 8)$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM provides:
Domain: $[2, 8]$, Range: $[6, 8]$
The original answer gives:
Domain: $(2, 8]$, Range: $[6, 8)$

The domain in the LLM's answer is the closed interval from 2 to 8, which includes both 2 and 8.
The domain in the original answer is the interval that is open at 2 and closed at 8. So it includes 8, but not 2.

The range in the LLM's answer is the closed interval from 6 to 8, which includes both 6 and 8.
The range in the original answer is the interval that is closed at 6 and open at 8. So it includes 6, but not 8.

Since the intervals are different, the answers are not the same.
