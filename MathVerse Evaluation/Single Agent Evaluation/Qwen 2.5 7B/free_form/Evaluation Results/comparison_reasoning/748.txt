GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $\sqrt{548} \approx 23.41 \, \text{cm}$, and the original answer is $23.41$.
The numerical value of the LLM answer is approximately 23.41, and it includes the unit cm. The original answer is 23.41.

Since the LLM's answer includes $\sqrt{548}$ and it approximates it to $23.41 \, \text{cm}$. Since $\sqrt{548} \approx 23.4094$, which is approximately 23.41, we can consider the LLM's answer $23.41 \, \text{cm}$ to be the same as the original answer $23.41$ when we assume the correct units are centimeters.
