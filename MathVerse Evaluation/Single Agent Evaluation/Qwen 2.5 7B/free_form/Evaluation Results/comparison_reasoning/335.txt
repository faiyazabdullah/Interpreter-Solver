GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $320^\circ$, which represents an angle of 320 degrees.
The original answer is 212°T, where T stands for "True". This is a bearing, which is the angle measured clockwise from North. So, 212°T means 212 degrees clockwise from North.

These are two different values and concepts. One is simply an angle of 320 degrees, and the other is a bearing of 212 degrees True.
Therefore they do not represent the same mathematical result.
