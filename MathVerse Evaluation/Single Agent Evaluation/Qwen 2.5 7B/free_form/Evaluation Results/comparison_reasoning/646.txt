GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is $218.4 \pi$. The original answer is $220.0 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

1.  **Numerical Equivalence:** The LLM answer is $218.4 \pi \approx 218.4 \times 3.14159 \approx 686.02$. The original answer is $220.0$. These are not numerically equivalent.

2.  **Unit Consistency:** The LLM answer has $\pi$, which is unitless. However, there is no indication of units in the LLM answer, so we can consider the possibility that the implied units are cubic centimeters. The original answer has units of $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$.

Since the numerical values are drastically different, and the units are given in the original answer, they are likely referring to volume, and not just a value of $218.4\pi$.
