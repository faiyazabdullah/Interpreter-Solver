GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $w = 22$ and the original answer is $22$.
The LLM answer is an equation setting the variable $w$ equal to $22$. The original answer is just the number $22$.
Since the variable $w$ is not defined in the original answer, we must assume that the problem was asking for the value of the variable $w$. In that case, the LLM answer is correct.

DECISION: YES
