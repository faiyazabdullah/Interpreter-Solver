GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is $113.137$. The original answer is Area $=113.097$ units $^{2}$.
The numerical values are $113.137$ and $113.097$. The difference between them is $|113.137 - 113.097| = 0.04$.
Since the difference is small, and without knowing the context it's reasonable to assume that rounding could play a factor here. I will assume that the numerical values are reasonably close approximations.
The original answer provides the units as "units $^{2}$" which is appropriate for an area.
