LLM ANSWER:
$(-\infty, 2] \text{ decreasing}, [2, \infty) \text{ increasing}$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$\text{Increasing at } (2, \infty) \text{ and decreasing at } (-\infty, 2)$

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer provides intervals where a function is increasing and decreasing, including the endpoints in the intervals (using square brackets). The original answer provides the intervals without including the endpoints (using parentheses). The difference lies in whether the endpoint 2 is included in the intervals. In the context of intervals of increase and decrease, the endpoints are generally not included since at the endpoint, the function is neither increasing nor decreasing (it's a stationary point). Thus, the LLM's answer technically includes the point where the function isn't strictly increasing or decreasing. However, given the usual interpretation in calculus, the two answers are considered equivalent.
