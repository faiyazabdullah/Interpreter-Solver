ORIGINAL ANSWER:
53.6^\circ

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
LLM answer: $b \approx 36.4^\circ$
Original answer: 53.6^\circ

1. Numerical Values:
   - LLM: 36.4
   - Original: 53.6

2. Units: Both are in degrees.

3. Mathematical Equivalence: Not applicable here.

4. Approximation: We need to see if these could be approximations of the same result. The difference between 36.4 and 53.6 is significant.

5. Context: Without more context, we cannot determine if these angles are related in some way (e.g., complementary angles summing to 90 degrees). However, given the problem statement, it is unlikely they are meant to be the same.

Since the numerical values are significantly different, they do not represent the same result.
