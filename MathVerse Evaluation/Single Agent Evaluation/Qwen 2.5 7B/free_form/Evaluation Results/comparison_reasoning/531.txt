GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "$y = 2$", which is an equation that defines the variable $y$ to be equal to 2. The original answer is "$2$", which is just a numerical value. In the context of solving for a variable, the original answer likely means that the solution to the problem is that the variable in question is equal to 2. The LLM answer explicitly states that $y = 2$, while the original answer simply states $2$, which in the context of the original problem may represent the value of $y$. Therefore, the LLM response and the original response are communicating the same information.
