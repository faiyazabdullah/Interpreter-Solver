The LLM answer is $d = 8$ and the original answer is $8$.

1.  NUMERICAL EQUIVALENCE: Both have the numerical value 8.
2.  UNIT CONSISTENCY: The LLM answer includes the variable $d$ and implies $d$ is equal to 8. The original answer just states 8. Without context, it is not possible to be absolutely certain that these are the same. However, without other information, it is reasonable to assume they are the same.
