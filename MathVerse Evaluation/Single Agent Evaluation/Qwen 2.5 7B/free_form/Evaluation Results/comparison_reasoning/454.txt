ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 454
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$r = 2$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$2$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "$r = 2$" and the original answer is "$2$".

1.  **Numerical Equivalence:** Both answers have the numerical value of 2.

2.  **Context:** The LLM answer includes "$r=$", which implies that $r$ is a variable and its value is 2. Without additional context, we don't know what $r$ refers to. However, the original answer is simply "2". Without knowing the question, we assume that we are solving for a variable and the answer is a numerical value. "r=2" and "2" are representing the same numerical result, just with the variable explicitly stated in one of the answers.

Therefore, the two answers represent the same mathematical result.
