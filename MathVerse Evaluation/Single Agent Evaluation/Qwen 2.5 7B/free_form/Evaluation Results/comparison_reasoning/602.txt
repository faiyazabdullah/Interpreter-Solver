ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 602
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$\([-5, 5]\)$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$[-5,-3) \cup(-3,5]$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is the closed interval from -5 to 5, including -5 and 5.
The original answer is the union of two intervals: from -5 to -3 (not including -3) and from -3 to 5 (including 5). This is the same as the interval from -5 to 5, except it excludes the single point -3.

Since the LLM answer includes -3 and the original answer excludes -3, the two answers are not the same.

DECISION: NO
