GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "$4.4 \text{ m$".
The original answer is "$4.4$".

The numerical values are the same (4.4).
The LLM answer has the unit "m", which likely stands for meters. The original answer does not have a unit. Without any context, it's hard to definitively say if they are the same. However, given that the LLM answer includes a unit, it's likely the original answer was missing a unit. Since no unit is provided, we will assume the unit is meters. Thus, $4.4$ is assumed to be $4.4$ m, which is the same as $4.4 \text{ m$
