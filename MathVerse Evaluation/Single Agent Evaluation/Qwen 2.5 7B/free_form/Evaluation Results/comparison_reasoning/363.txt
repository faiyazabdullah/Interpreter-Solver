ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 363
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$21.6 \text{ m}$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$21.6$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "$21.6 \text{ m}$" and the original answer is "$21.6$".

1. NUMERICAL EQUIVALENCE: Both answers contain the numerical value 21.6.
2. UNIT CONSISTENCY: The LLM answer has the unit "m" (meters) and the original answer has no unit. In order for the two answers to be equivalent, the problem must be implicitly using meters as the default unit. Let's assume that the original answer implicitly assumes the unit is meters.

Based on the above assumptions, we can conclude that the two answers represent the same mathematical result.
