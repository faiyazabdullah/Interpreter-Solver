ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 485
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$\text{Domain: } [-4, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 4]$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$\text{Domain: } (-\infty, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [0, \infty)$

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer states the domain as $[-4, 1]$ and range as $[0, 4]$. The original answer states the domain as $(-\infty, 1]$ and range as $[0, \infty)$.
The domains are different: $[-4, 1]$ is a closed interval including -4 and 1, while $(-\infty, 1]$ is an interval including all real numbers less than or equal to 1. Since $-5$ belongs to $(-\infty, 1]$ but not to $[-4, 1]$, the domains are not the same.
The ranges are also different: $[0, 4]$ is a closed interval from 0 to 4, while $[0, \infty)$ is an interval including all non-negative real numbers. Since $5$ belongs to $[0, \infty)$ but not to $[0, 4]$, the ranges are not the same.
Therefore, the LLM generated answer and the original answer do not represent the same mathematical result.
