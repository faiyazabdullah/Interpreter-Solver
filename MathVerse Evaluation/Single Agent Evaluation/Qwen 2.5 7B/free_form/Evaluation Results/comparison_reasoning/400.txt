GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $\frac{121\pi}{4}$ and the original answer is $\frac{121 \pi}{4} \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.
Both answers have the same numerical value $\frac{121\pi}{4}$.
The LLM answer does not include units, while the original answer includes units of $m^2$. Since the problem asks for area, the original answer is more complete. However, mathematically the numerical value is the same.
Without the context of the problem, it is difficult to say definitively if they are the same. However, since the question is asking whether they are mathematically the same, we can ignore the units.

DECISION: YES
