GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $1250\pi$. The original answer is $\frac{1225\pi }{2} \text { units }^2$.
We need to compare $1250\pi$ and $\frac{1225\pi }{2}$.

First, we can simplify the original answer: $\frac{1225\pi }{2} = 612.5\pi$.
Now, we compare $1250\pi$ and $612.5\pi$. They are not equal.
$1250\pi \neq 612.5\pi$.

Also, the original answer has units of units$^2$, which is an area. The LLM's answer has no units. However, we should still compare the numbers. Since the numerical values are different, the answers are not the same.
