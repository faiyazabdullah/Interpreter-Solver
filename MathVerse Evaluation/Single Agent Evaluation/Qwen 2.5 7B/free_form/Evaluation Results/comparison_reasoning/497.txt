GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is $f(x) = -1.5x + 3$ and the original answer is $-\frac{3}{2}x+3$.
We need to determine if these two expressions are equivalent.

The first answer has a decimal coefficient of $x$, while the second answer has a fractional coefficient of $x$.
Let's compare the coefficients:
$-1.5 = -\frac{15}{10} = -\frac{3}{2}$.
So, $-1.5x = -\frac{3}{2}x$.
Both answers have the same constant term, which is 3.

Since the coefficient of $x$ is the same and the constant term is the same, the two expressions are equivalent.

DECISION: YES
