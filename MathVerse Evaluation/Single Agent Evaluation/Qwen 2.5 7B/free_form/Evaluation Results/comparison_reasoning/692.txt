GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $818.68 \, \text{cm}^3$, and the original answer is $816.81 \, \text{cm}^{3}$. The units are the same. The numerical values are $818.68$ and $816.81$. The difference between the two numbers is $|818.68 - 816.81| = 1.87$. As a percentage, the difference is $\frac{1.87}{816.81} \times 100\% \approx 0.229\%$. This is a small difference, so the answers are close. However, they are not equal. Since a small error in calculation can cause this difference, and without knowing the context of the problem, it's difficult to determine if the answers are close enough to be considered the same. Since they are not equal, they are not the same.
