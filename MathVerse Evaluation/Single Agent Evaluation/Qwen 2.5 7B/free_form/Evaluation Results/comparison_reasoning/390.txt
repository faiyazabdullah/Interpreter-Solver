LLM ANSWER:
$r = 7.00 \, \text{cm}$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$$r=7.00$$

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is "$r = 7.00 \, \text{cm}$" and the original answer is "$r=7.00$".
The numerical values are the same (7.00).
The LLM answer includes the unit "cm", while the original answer does not specify the unit.
Without knowing the problem context, we cannot definitively say if the unit "cm" is required or implied. However, if we assume that the problem is about lengths, the absence of a unit in the original answer could be interpreted as either unitless or that it should have units of cm.

Since the numerical values are the same and the units are potentially compatible (cm), we can consider them to be representing the same result.
