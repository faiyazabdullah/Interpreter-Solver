ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 721
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
12x^2+144x+384 \mathrm{m}^3

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is $V = 12x^2 + 144x + 384$, and the original answer is $12x^2+144x+384 \mathrm{m}^3$.
The numerical expressions are the same, $12x^2 + 144x + 384$. The original answer also includes the unit $\mathrm{m}^3$, which represents cubic meters or volume. The LLM generated answer is missing the units. However, since the problem number is 721, and volume is likely to be the correct unit, the only difference is the presence or absence of the units. Since the problem asks if they represent the same mathematical result, and both have the same mathematical expression, the answer is YES.
