LLM answer: $325.75^\circ$
Original answer: $N\ 34^\circ\ W$

The LLM answer is in degrees, representing an angle. The original answer is in the compass direction format.
We need to convert the compass direction to degrees to compare them.

$N\ 34^\circ\ W$ means starting from North, we rotate $34^\circ$ towards the West.
Since North is $0^\circ$ (or $360^\circ$), and we rotate towards West, the angle is $360^\circ - 34^\circ = 326^\circ$.

LLM answer: $325.75^\circ$
Original answer: $326^\circ$

The values are close, differing by $0.25^\circ$. This could be a rounding issue. Let's assume the LLM answer is a rounded value. They are reasonably close approximations, and we can assume they represent the same direction.
