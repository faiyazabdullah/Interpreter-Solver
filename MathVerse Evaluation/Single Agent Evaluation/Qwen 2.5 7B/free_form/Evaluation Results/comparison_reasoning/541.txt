GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "y = 3", which implies that the solution to some equation is y = 3.
The original answer is "3", which implies that the solution to some equation is 3.

The difference lies in the inclusion of "y =" in the LLM answer, while the original answer is simply "3". However, if we are solving for y, both answers convey the same information: y = 3.

DECISION: YES
