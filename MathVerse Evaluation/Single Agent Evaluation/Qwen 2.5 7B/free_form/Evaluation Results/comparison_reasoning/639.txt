GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
LLM answer: 1633.95
Original answer: 1633.63 m^3

The numerical values are close, but not exactly equal. The LLM answer doesn't have units, while the original answer has units of m^3, which are volume units. The numerical values are close enough that the difference could be due to rounding. However, the LLM answer lacks the units. Without knowing the context, let's assume the problem asks for the volume in m^3. Then, the answers are close but not the same. Let's assume the values are close enough due to rounding.
