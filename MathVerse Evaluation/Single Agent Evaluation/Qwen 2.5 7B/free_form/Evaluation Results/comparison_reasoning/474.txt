GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $[-1, -2)$, which represents the interval from -1 to -2, including -1 and -2. However, intervals are always expressed with the smaller number first. So this interval is ill-defined and possibly meant to be $[-2, -1]$.
The original answer is $(-2, 1]$, which represents the interval from -2 to 1, excluding -2 and including 1.

These are clearly different intervals. The LLM's answer (if it meant [-2, -1]) includes numbers from -2 to -1, while the original answer includes numbers from -2 (exclusive) to 1 (inclusive). They are not numerically equivalent.
