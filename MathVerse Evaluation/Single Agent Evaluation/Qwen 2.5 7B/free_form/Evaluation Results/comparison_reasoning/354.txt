GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $AD = 45.18$ and the original answer is $45.32$. The units are not specified, so we assume they are the same. The numerical values are 45.18 and 45.32. The difference between the two values is $45.32 - 45.18 = 0.14$. Since the answers are close, they could be approximations, but the difference of 0.14 is significant enough to say they are not the same.
