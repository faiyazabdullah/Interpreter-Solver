ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 481
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$ \text{Domain: } [-4, 4], \quad \text{Range: } [-4, 1]$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$\text{Domain: } [-4, 0),\quad \text{Range: } (-3, 1]$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer states the domain is [-4, 4] and the range is [-4, 1]. The original answer states the domain is [-4, 0) and the range is (-3, 1].

Comparing the domains, [-4, 4] includes the values from -4 up to and including 4. [-4, 0) includes the values from -4 up to but not including 0. The domains are therefore different.

Comparing the ranges, [-4, 1] includes the values from -4 up to and including 1. (-3, 1] includes the values from -3 up to and including 1, but not including -3. The ranges are therefore different.

Therefore, the two answers do not represent the same mathematical result.
