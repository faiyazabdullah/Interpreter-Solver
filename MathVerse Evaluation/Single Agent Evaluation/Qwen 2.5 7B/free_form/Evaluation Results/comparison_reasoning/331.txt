GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is 45 degrees, and the original answer is 315 degrees with a "T" suffix. The "T" likely represents a true bearing in navigation, meaning the angle is measured clockwise from North.
Since 45 and 315 are different numbers, and they aren't simply directional equivalents (e.g., 45 degrees isn't the same direction as 315 degrees), they are not the same.

DECISION: NO
