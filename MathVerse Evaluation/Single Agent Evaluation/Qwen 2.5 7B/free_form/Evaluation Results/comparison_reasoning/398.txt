GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $\frac{\pi}{25}$.
The original answer is Area $=\frac{\pi}{25} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.

The numerical values are the same, $\frac{\pi}{25}$.
The original answer includes the unit $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, which is a unit of area, as indicated by the "Area =" part of the answer. The LLM answer does not include units. However, since the original answer specifies "Area", the LLM answer must be assumed to also be an area. It's just missing the unit. I will assume the prompt implied that the units should be included if applicable. Because the units are missing, it is not the same mathematical result.
