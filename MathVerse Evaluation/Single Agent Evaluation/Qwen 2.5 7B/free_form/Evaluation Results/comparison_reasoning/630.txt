LLM ANSWER:
$$(90^\circ, 5)$$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
y=\sin x=\left(90^\circ ,5\right)

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is $(90^\circ, 5)$. The original answer is $y = \sin x = (90^\circ, 5)$.

The LLM answer provides a coordinate point $(90^\circ, 5)$. The original answer has an equation $y = \sin x$ and states the same coordinate point $(90^\circ, 5)$. Since $90^\circ$ is an angle, $x$ could be $90^\circ$. Then $\sin(90^\circ) = 1$, which means $y = 1$. However, the coordinate point given is $(90^\circ, 5)$. Therefore, $y = \sin x$ doesn't represent the same thing as the coordinate point $(90^\circ, 5)$. I am going to assume that the original problem presented had an error and the point was intended to be $(90^\circ, 1)$ and not $(90^\circ, 5)$. Because the y-value in the coordinate point is different, the LLM and the original answer do NOT represent the same mathematical result.
