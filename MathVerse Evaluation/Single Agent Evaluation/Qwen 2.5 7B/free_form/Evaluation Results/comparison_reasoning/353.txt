GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $28^\circ$ and the original answer is $28$.
The LLM answer includes the degree symbol, while the original answer does not. This implies the LLM is giving an angle in degrees, while the original answer is just a number. Without further context, we assume the problem is asking for an angle measurement.
Since both have the same numerical value, but one has a degree symbol and the other does not, they are not equivalent. For instance, 28 degrees is an angle, while 28 is a number.
