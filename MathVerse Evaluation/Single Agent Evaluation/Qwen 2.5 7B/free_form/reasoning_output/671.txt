QUESTION:
We want to find the surface area of this shape. Assume that both boxes are identical in size. The box has sides of length 25, 20 and 33. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11.

Find the surface area of the solid.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the solid, we need to consider the individual surfaces of the boxes and the cylinder, then subtract the overlapping areas.

1. **Box Surface Area Calculation**:
   Each box has dimensions \(25 \times 20 \times 33\).

   - Two faces with area \(25 \times 20 = 500\) each.
   - Two faces with area \(25 \times 33 = 825\) each.
   - Two faces with area \(20 \times 33 = 660\) each.

   Since there are two boxes, the total surface area of the two boxes is:
   \[
   2 \left(2 \times 500 + 2 \times 825 + 2 \times 660\right) = 2 \left(1000 + 1650 + 1320\right) = 2 \times 3970 = 7940
   \]

2. **Cylinder Surface Area Calculation**:
   The cylinder has a radius \(r = 6\) and a height \(h = 11\).

   - The lateral surface area of the cylinder is given by \(2\pi rh = 2\pi \times 6 \times 11 = 132\pi\).
   - The top and bottom circular areas are not present since they are covered by the boxes.

3. **Overlapping Areas**:
   - Each box has a circular opening with diameter 12 (since the radius is 6) which covers part of its side.
   - The area of one circle is \(\pi \times 6^2 = 36\pi\).

   Since there are two circles, the total area covered by these circles is:
   \[
   2 \times 36\pi = 72\pi
   \]

4. **Final Surface Area Calculation**:
   Subtract the overlapping area from the total surface area of the two boxes and add the lateral surface area of the cylinder:
   \[
   \text{Surface Area} = 7940 + 132\pi - 72\pi = 7940 + 60\pi
   \]

Now, let's calculate the numerical value:

\[
7940 + 60\pi \approx 7940 + 188.5 \approx 8128.5
\]

Thus, the final surface area rounded to two decimal places is:

Final Answer: $\boxed{8128.50}$
