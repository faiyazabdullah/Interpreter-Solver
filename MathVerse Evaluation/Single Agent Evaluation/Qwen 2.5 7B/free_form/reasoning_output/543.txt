QUESTION:
$f$ is a trigonometric function of the form $f(x)=a \cos (b x+c)+d$.
Below is the graph of $f(x)$. The function has a maximum point at $(-2,-3)$ and a minimum point at $(-2.5,-9)$. Find a formula for $f(x)$. Give an exact expression.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the formula for the trigonometric function \( f(x) = a \cos(bx + c) + d \), we need to determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) using the given points.

### Step 1: Determine the amplitude (\(a\))
The amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values of the function. Here, the maximum value is \(-3\) and the minimum value is \(-9\). Thus, the amplitude \(a\) is:
\[ a = \frac{-3 - (-9)}{2} = \frac{-3 + 9}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

### Step 2: Determine the vertical shift (\(d\))
The vertical shift \(d\) is the average of the maximum and minimum values. So,
\[ d = \frac{-3 + (-9)}{2} = \frac{-3 - 9}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6 \]

### Step 3: Determine the period and phase shift
The period of the cosine function is the distance between two consecutive maximum or minimum points. Here, the distance between the maximum point at \(x = -2\) and the next maximum point at \(x = -4\) is 2 units. Therefore, the period \(T\) is:
\[ T = 2 \]
Since the period \(T\) of a cosine function \(a \cos(bx + c) + d\) is given by \(T = \frac{2\pi}{b}\), we have:
\[ 2 = \frac{2\pi}{b} \implies b = \pi \]

### Step 4: Determine the phase shift (\(c\))
The phase shift can be determined from the horizontal shift of the maximum point. The maximum point at \(x = -2\) corresponds to the standard cosine function's peak at \(x = 0\) after shifting. To align the peak at \(x = -2\), we need to solve for \(c\):
\[ b(-2) + c = 0 \implies \pi(-2) + c = 0 \implies c = 2\pi \]

Thus, the function is:
\[ f(x) = 3 \cos(\pi x + 2\pi) - 6 \]

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: $f(x) = 3 \cos(\pi x + 2\pi) - 6$
