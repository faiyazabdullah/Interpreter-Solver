QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.
Find the radius of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the radius of the circle, we need to determine the distance from the center of the circle to any of its intersections with the coordinate axes. From the image, it appears that the circle intersects the y-axis at \( y = -3 \).

Since the circle is centered at the origin \((0, 0)\), the radius is the distance from the center to one of these points. The distance formula gives us:

\[ r = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (-3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 9} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \]

Therefore, the radius of the circle is \( 3 \).

Final Answer: $r = 3$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $r = 3$
