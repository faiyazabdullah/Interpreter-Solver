QUESTION:
Assume that both boxes are identical in size. The box has edges of length 20, 25 and 33. The middle cylinder has radius of 6 and height of 11.
Find the surface area of the solid.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total surface area of the solid formed by combining two identical rectangular boxes and one cylinder.

### Step 1: Calculate the surface area of one rectangular box
The dimensions of each rectangular box are 20, 25, and 33.

The surface area \(A_{\text{box}}\) of one box is calculated as follows:
\[ A_{\text{box}} = 2 \left( ab + bc + ca \right) \]
where \(a = 20\), \(b = 25\), and \(c = 33\).

Substitute the values:
\[ A_{\text{box}} = 2 \left( 20 \cdot 25 + 25 \cdot 33 + 33 \cdot 20 \right) \]
\[ A_{\text{box}} = 2 \left( 500 + 825 + 660 \right) \]
\[ A_{\text{box}} = 2 \left( 1985 \right) \]
\[ A_{\text{box}} = 3970 \]

Since there are two boxes, the total surface area for both boxes is:
\[ A_{\text{boxes}} = 2 \times 3970 = 7940 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the lateral surface area of the cylinder
The cylinder has a radius \(r = 6\) and height \(h = 11\).

The lateral surface area \(A_{\text{cylinder}}\) of the cylinder is:
\[ A_{\text{cylinder}} = 2 \pi r h \]
\[ A_{\text{cylinder}} = 2 \pi \cdot 6 \cdot 11 \]
\[ A_{\text{cylinder}} = 132 \pi \]

### Step 3: Subtract the areas where the boxes and cylinder overlap
The boxes have overlapping areas where they meet the cylinder. Each box has a face that overlaps with the cylinder's surface.

The overlapping areas are:
- Two faces of the box overlap with the cylinder's lateral surface.

Each of these faces is a rectangle with dimensions 25 (height of the box) and 6 (radius of the cylinder):
\[ A_{\text{overlap}} = 2 \left( 25 \cdot 6 \right) \]
\[ A_{\text{overlap}} = 2 \left( 150 \right) \]
\[ A_{\text{overlap}} = 300 \]

Since there are two boxes, the total overlapping area is:
\[ A_{\text{total overlap}} = 2 \times 300 = 600 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total surface area of the solid
The total surface area of the solid is the sum of the surface areas of the two boxes minus the overlapping areas plus the lateral surface area of the cylinder:

\[ A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{boxes}} - A_{\text{total overlap}} + A_{\text{cylinder}} \]
\[ A_{\text{total}} = 7940 - 600 + 132 \pi \]

### Step 5: Substitute the value of \(\pi\)
Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[ A_{\text{total}} = 7940 - 600 + 132 \times 3.14159 \]
\[ A_{\text{total}} = 7940 - 600 + 416.47 \]
\[ A_{\text{total}} = 7336.47 \]

### Final Answer:
\[ \boxed{7336.47} \]

Final Answer: $7336.47$
