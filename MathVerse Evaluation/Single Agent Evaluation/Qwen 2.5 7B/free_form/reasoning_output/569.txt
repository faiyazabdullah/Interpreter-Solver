QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the equation for function \( g(x) \), we need to analyze the transformation applied to the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). The graph shows that \( g(x) \) is a vertical shift of \( f(x) \).

1. **Identify the transformation**: By examining the graph, it appears that the parabola \( g(x) \) is shifted downward from \( f(x) = x^2 \) by 5 units. This means that every point \((x, y)\) on \( f(x) \) is moved to \((x, y-5)\) on \( g(x) \).

2. **Formulate the equation**: The equation for \( g(x) \) can be written by subtracting 5 from the output of \( f(x) \):
   \[
   g(x) = f(x) - 5 = x^2 - 5
   \]

Therefore, the equation for \( g(x) \) is:
\[
g(x) = x^2 - 5
\]

Final Answer: $g(x) = x^2 - 5$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $g(x) = x^2 - 5$
