QUESTION:
Two piecewirse function $g$ and $f$ are graphed, $g$ is graphed in purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), $f$ is graphed in blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). t is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport.
The airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon.
What is the other time the airplanes have the same height?
Round your answer to the nearest ten minutes.
About _ minutes after noon

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the other time the airplanes have the same height, we need to identify where the two piecewise functions \( g \) and \( f \) intersect, excluding the initial intersection at 9 minutes past noon.

From the graph:
- At \( t = 9 \) minutes, both \( g \) and \( f \) are at 9000 meters.
- We need to find another intersection point.

By examining the graph, it appears there is another intersection point around \( t = 80 \) minutes past noon.

To confirm this, let's check the values of \( g \) and \( f \) at \( t = 80 \):
- For \( g \): At \( t = 80 \), \( g(t) = 9000 \).
- For \( f \): At \( t = 80 \), \( f(t) = 9000 \).

Both functions have the same value at \( t = 80 \) minutes past noon, confirming the second intersection point.

Therefore, the other time the airplanes have the same height is 80 minutes past noon.

Final Answer: $80$
