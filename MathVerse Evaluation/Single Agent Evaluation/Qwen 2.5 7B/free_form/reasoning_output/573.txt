QUESTION:
Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2 in blue. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation for \( g(x) \), we need to determine how the function \( f(x) = x^2 \) has been translated to form \( g(x) \). From the graph:

1. The parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \) is shifted horizontally to the left by 2 units and vertically downward by 3 units to form \( g(x) \).
2. The horizontal shift to the left by 2 units can be represented as replacing \( x \) with \( x + 2 \) in the function \( f(x) \).
3. The vertical shift downward by 3 units can be represented by subtracting 3 from the function.

Thus, the equation for \( g(x) \) is:
\[ g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 3 \]

Final Answer: $g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 3$

====================================================================================================
EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $g(x) = (x + 2)^2 - 3$
