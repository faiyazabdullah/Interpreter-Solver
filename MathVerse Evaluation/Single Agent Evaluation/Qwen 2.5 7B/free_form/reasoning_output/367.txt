QUESTION:
Sand has an angle of friction of about 40Â°. This means once it gets over this it slides down the side of the sand pile. Mae is getting a delivery of sand to her home, but the area where the sand will be delivered is only 10.6 metres wide. If h metres is the maximum height of the sandpile, find h to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum height \( h \) of the sandpile given that the base width is \( 10.6 \) meters and the angle of repose is \( 40^\circ \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Geometry:**
   The sandpile forms a right triangle with the angle of repose at the top vertex.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Base width (\( b \)) = \( 10.6 \) meters
   - Angle of repose (\( \theta \)) = \( 40^\circ \)

3. **Determine the Relationship:**
   In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.
   \[
   \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
   \]
   Here, the opposite side is the height \( h \) and the adjacent side is half the base width (since the triangle is symmetric).
   \[
   \tan(40^\circ) = \frac{h}{\frac{10.6}{2}}
   \]

4. **Substitute and Solve:**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   \tan(40^\circ) = \frac{h}{5.3}
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 5.3:
   \[
   h = 5.3 \cdot \tan(40^\circ)
   \]

5. **Calculate the Tangent Value:**
   Using a calculator, find the value of \( \tan(40^\circ) \):
   \[
   \tan(40^\circ) \approx 0.8391
   \]

6. **Find \( h \):**
   \[
   h = 5.3 \cdot 0.8391 \approx 4.402
   \]

7. **Round to One Decimal Place:**
   \[
   h \approx 4.4
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4.4 \text{ m}}
\]
