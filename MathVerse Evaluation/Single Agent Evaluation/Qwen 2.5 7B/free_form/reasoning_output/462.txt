QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the radius of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the radius of the circle, we need to analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The circle intersects the x-axis at two points and the y-axis at two points, forming a square around the circle.
2. The center of the circle is located at the origin $(0,0)$.
3. The circle intersects the x-axis at points where the y-coordinate is zero, and the y-axis at points where the x-coordinate is zero.
4. By examining the graph, we can see that the circle's diameter is equal to the distance between the farthest points on the x-axis and y-axis.

From the graph, it appears that the circle's diameter is equal to 10 units along both the x-axis and the y-axis. Therefore, the radius \( r \) of the circle is half of the diameter.

\[ r = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Final Answer: $r = 5$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $r = 5$
