QUESTION:
The line goes through the origin. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane, we need to analyze the graph:

1. The line passes through the origin, which means it has the form \(y = mx\), where \(m\) is the slope.
2. The line is dashed, indicating it is not included in the solution set.
3. The line slopes downward, meaning \(m < 0\).

Given these observations, the inequality describing the region is:
\[ y < mx \]

Since the line passes through the origin, the slope \(m\) can be determined from the two points provided on the graph. However, without specific numerical values for the coordinates of those points, we can only describe the general form of the inequality.

Therefore, the inequality that describes the region is:
\[ y < 0 \]

Final Answer: $y < 0$
