QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the pyramid. The perpendicular height is 8mm. The base is a square with the edge of 10mm. Include all faces in your calculations.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the pyramid, we need to calculate the area of the base and the areas of the four triangular faces.

1. **Calculate the area of the base**:
   The base is a square with side length \(10 \text{ mm}\).
   \[
   \text{Area of the base} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ mm}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of one triangular face**:
   Each triangular face has a base of \(10 \text{ mm}\) and a height that can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, the slant height, and half the base of the square.
   
   Let's denote the slant height as \(l\) and the height of the pyramid as \(h = 8 \text{ mm}\). The half-base of the square is \(5 \text{ mm}\).

   Using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   l^2 = h^2 + \left(\frac{\text{base}}{2}\right)^2 = 8^2 + 5^2 = 64 + 25 = 89
   \]
   \[
   l = \sqrt{89} \approx 9.43 \text{ mm}
   \]

   Now, the area of one triangular face is:
   \[
   \text{Area of one triangular face} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{slant height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 9.43 \approx 47.15 \text{ mm}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the total area of the four triangular faces**:
   \[
   \text{Total area of the four triangular faces} = 4 \times 47.15 = 188.60 \text{ mm}^2
   \]

4. **Calculate the total surface area of the pyramid**:
   \[
   \text{Total surface area} = \text{Area of the base} + \text{Total area of the four triangular faces} = 100 + 188.60 = 288.60 \text{ mm}^2
   \]

Final Answer: $288.60 \text{ mm}^2$
