QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( L \), the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can, we need to determine the space diagonal of the cylinder. The space diagonal forms a right triangle where one leg is the height of the cylinder (\( h \)), the other leg is the diameter of the base (\( d \)), and the hypotenuse is the length of the longest straw (\( L \)).

Given:
- Height of the cylinder (\( h \)) = 13 cm
- Radius of the base (\( r \)) = 3 cm
- Diameter of the base (\( d \)) = 2r = 2 * 3 = 6 cm

We use the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions:

\[ L = \sqrt{h^2 + d^2} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ L = \sqrt{13^2 + 6^2} \]
\[ L = \sqrt{169 + 36} \]
\[ L = \sqrt{205} \]

Now, calculate the value:

\[ L \approx \sqrt{205} \approx 14.32 \]

Rounding down to the nearest whole number:

\[ L = 14 \]

Final Answer: $L = 14$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $L = 14$
