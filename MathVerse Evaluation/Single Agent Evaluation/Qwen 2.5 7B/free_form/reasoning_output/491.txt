QUESTION:
There is an odd function f going through (0,0). Estimate the point(s) at which the graph of f has a local maximum or a local minimum.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given graph and determine the points where the function \( f \) has a local maximum or a local minimum.

1. **Examine the Graph**: 
   - The graph shows an odd function that passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).
   - There is one point where the graph appears to have a local maximum, and another point where it appears to have a local minimum.

2. **Identify Key Points**:
   - The local maximum seems to occur at approximately \((-3, 50)\).
   - The local minimum seems to occur at approximately \((3, -50)\).

3. **Determine the Coordinates**:
   - The local maximum occurs at \((-3, 50)\).
   - The local minimum occurs at \((3, -50)\).

Given these observations, the points at which the graph of \( f \) has a local maximum or a local minimum are:

Final Answer: $(-3, 50), (3, -50)$
