QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to find the length \( L \) of the longest straw that can fit into the cylindrical can such that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given dimensions:**
   - Height of the cylinder (\( h \)): 13 cm
   - Radius of the cylinder (\( r \)): 3 cm

2. **Visualize the problem:**
   The longest straw will be the hypotenuse of a right triangle where one leg is the height of the cylinder (\( h \)) and the other leg is the diameter of the base of the cylinder (\( 2r \)).

3. **Calculate the diameter of the base:**
   \[
   \text{Diameter} = 2r = 2 \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 6 \, \text{cm}
   \]

4. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem:**
   The length of the straw (\( L \)) forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs of lengths \( h \) and \( 2r \):
   \[
   L^2 = h^2 + (2r)^2
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   L^2 = 13^2 + 6^2
   \]
   \[
   L^2 = 169 + 36
   \]
   \[
   L^2 = 205
   \]
   \[
   L = \sqrt{205}
   \]

5. **Calculate the square root and round to the nearest whole number:**
   \[
   L \approx \sqrt{205} \approx 14.32 \, \text{cm}
   \]
   Rounding down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   L \approx 14 \, \text{cm}
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{14 \, \text{cm}}
\]
