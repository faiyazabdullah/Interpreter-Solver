QUESTION:
Write an equation for the transformation of f(x)=|x| as shown in the figure, which passes (3, 3) and are piecewise.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given problem:

We have a piecewise function that is a transformation of \( f(x) = |x| \), passing through the point \((3, 3)\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Transformation**:
   The basic function is \( f(x) = |x| \). This is a V-shaped function that opens upwards with its vertex at the origin \((0, 0)\).

2. **Determine the Form**:
   Since we need a piecewise function, it suggests that the function could shift, stretch, or compress the original \( |x| \) function.

3. **Point \((3, 3)\)**:
   We know the function must pass through \((3, 3)\). Let's assume the form of the piecewise function is:
   \[
   f(x) = 
   \begin{cases} 
   ax + b & \text{if } x < c \\
   cx + d & \text{if } x \geq c 
   \end{cases}
   \]
   Given that \( f(3) = 3 \), we can substitute \( x = 3 \) into both pieces:
   \[
   a(3) + b = 3 \implies 3a + b = 3 \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

4. **Simplify the Original Function**:
   Since the original function \( f(x) = |x| \) becomes linear beyond a certain point, let's assume the transformation is such that the function is linear beyond a specific \( x \)-value, say \( x = 3 \).

5. **Formulate the Linear Pieces**:
   Assume the linear function starts after \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 
   \begin{cases} 
   mx + n & \text{if } x < 3 \\
   kx + l & \text{if } x \geq 3 
   \end{cases}
   \]
   Given \( f(3) = 3 \):
   \[
   k(3) + l = 3 \implies 3k + l = 3 \quad \text{(2)}
   \]

6. **Determine the Slopes**:
   For \( x < 3 \), the slope \( m \) should match the behavior of \( |x| \), which is 1 for \( x \geq 0 \). Thus:
   \[
   m = 1 \quad \text{(3)}
   \]
   Substituting \( m = 1 \) into equation (1):
   \[
   1 \cdot 3 + b = 3 \implies 3 + b = 3 \implies b = 0
   \]

7. **Slope for \( x \geq 3 \)**:
   Similarly, for \( x \geq 3 \), the slope \( k \) should match the behavior of \( |x| \), which is 1 for \( x \geq 0 \). Thus:
   \[
   k = 1 \quad \text{(4)}
   \]
   Substituting \( k = 1 \) into equation (2):
   \[
   1 \cdot 3 + l = 3 \implies 3 + l = 3 \implies l = 0
   \]

### Final Equation:
Thus, combining these results, the piecewise function is:
\[
f(x) = 
\begin{cases} 
x & \text{if } x < 3 \\
x & \text{if } x \geq 3 
\end{cases}
\]

Since both conditions reduce to the same linear function, the final simplified form is:
\[
f(x) = x
\]

Final Answer: $f(x) = x$
