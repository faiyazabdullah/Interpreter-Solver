QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the figure shown, rounded to two decimal places. Assume that the solid is three quarters of a cylinder. The height is 12 cm and radius is 5 cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the given figure, which is three-quarters of a cylinder, we need to calculate the lateral surface area of the full cylinder and then adjust it according to the fraction of the cylinder provided.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the lateral surface area of the full cylinder:**
   The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is:
   \[
   A_{\text{lateral}} = 2\pi r h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

   Given:
   \[
   r = 5 \, \text{cm}, \quad h = 12 \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Substituting the values:
   \[
   A_{\text{lateral}} = 2\pi \times 5 \times 12 = 120\pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

2. **Adjust for three-quarters of the cylinder:**
   Since we have only three-quarters of the cylinder, we need to find one-quarter of the lateral surface area first:
   \[
   A_{\text{one-quarter}} = \frac{120\pi}{4} = 30\pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

3. **Add the area of the curved rectangular face:**
   The curved rectangular face is a rectangle whose width is the circumference of the base of the cylinder and length is the height of the cylinder. The circumference of the base is:
   \[
   C = 2\pi r = 2\pi \times 5 = 10\pi \, \text{cm}
   \]

   Therefore, the area of the curved rectangular face is:
   \[
   A_{\text{rectangle}} = 10\pi \times 12 = 120\pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

4. **Calculate the total surface area:**
   Adding the area of the curved rectangular face and one-quarter of the lateral surface area:
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = 30\pi + 120\pi = 150\pi \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

5. **Round to two decimal places:**
   \[
   150\pi \approx 471.2388 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{471.24 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
