QUESTION:
A ship is 27m away from the bottom of a cliff. A lighthouse is located at the top of the cliff. The ship's distance is 34m from the bottom of the lighthouse and 37m from the top of the lighthouse.
Hence find the height of the lighthouse to the nearest tenth of a metre.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve this problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the right triangles involved:**
   - We have two right triangles formed by the distances given.
   - The first triangle has legs of \(27\) meters and \(y\) meters (the unknown height of the lighthouse).
   - The second triangle has legs of \(34\) meters and \(x\) meters (the unknown part of the lighthouse).

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem for both triangles:**
   - For the first triangle: 
     \[
     27^2 + y^2 = 34^2
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     729 + y^2 = 1156 \implies y^2 = 427 \implies y = \sqrt{427}
     \]

3. **For the second triangle:**
   - The total height of the lighthouse is \(y + x\), where \(x\) is the remaining height.
   - The distance from the ship to the top of the lighthouse is \(37\) meters.
     \[
     27^2 + x^2 = 37^2
     \]
     Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     729 + x^2 = 1369 \implies x^2 = 640 \implies x = \sqrt{640}
     \]

4. **Find the total height of the lighthouse (\(y + x\)):**
   \[
   y + x = \sqrt{427} + \sqrt{640}
   \]

5. **Calculate the values of \(y\) and \(x\) using approximate values:**
   \[
   y \approx \sqrt{427} \approx 20.66 \quad \text{(rounded to two decimal places)}
   \]
   \[
   x \approx \sqrt{640} \approx 25.3 \quad \text{(rounded to two decimal places)}
   \]

6. **Sum these values to get the total height of the lighthouse:**
   \[
   y + x \approx 20.66 + 25.3 = 45.96 \quad \text{(rounded to two decimal places)}
   \]

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: $45.96$
