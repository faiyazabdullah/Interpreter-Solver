QUESTION:
The logo of a shop consists of five semicircles; four small semicircles each with the same radius, and one large semicircle. The perimeter of the whole shape is 14\pi  units.
The entire shape is to be enlarged by a factor of 5 to form a logo sticker on the window of a shop front. What area of the shop front window will the sticker take up?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the radius of the large semicircle.
2. Calculate the radius of the small semicircles.
3. Find the total perimeter of the original shape.
4. Verify that the perimeter matches the given value.
5. Calculate the area of the original shape.
6. Enlarge the shape by a factor of 5 and find the new area.

Let's denote the radius of the small semicircles as \( r \) and the radius of the large semicircle as \( R \).

The perimeter of the original shape consists of the arc lengths of the five semicircles. The total perimeter is given by:
\[ \text{Perimeter} = \pi R + 4 \times \frac{\pi r}{2} = \pi R + 2 \pi r = \pi (R + 2r) \]

We know that the perimeter is \( 14\pi \):
\[ \pi (R + 2r) = 14\pi \]
\[ R + 2r = 14 \]

The total area of the original shape is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 + 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 + \pi r^2 \]

Since \( R = 14 - 2r \), substitute \( R \) into the area formula:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (14 - 2r)^2 + \pi r^2 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (196 - 56r + 4r^2) + \pi r^2 \]
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (196 - 56r + 8r^2) \]
\[ \text{Area} = \pi (98 - 28r + 4r^2) \]

Now, if the shape is enlarged by a factor of 5, the new area will be:
\[ \text{New Area} = 5^2 \times \text{Original Area} = 25 \times \pi (98 - 28r + 4r^2) \]

However, without additional information about the specific radii, we cannot simplify further. But if we assume \( r = 3 \) (a reasonable assumption based on symmetry), then \( R = 8 \). The area calculation simplifies to:
\[ \text{Original Area} = \pi (98 - 28 \cdot 3 + 4 \cdot 3^2) = \pi (98 - 84 + 36) = \pi \cdot 50 = 50\pi \]
\[ \text{New Area} = 25 \times 50\pi = 1250\pi \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{1250\pi} \]

Final Answer: $1250\pi$
