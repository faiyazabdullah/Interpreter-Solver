QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (-1,3) and (-1,-3). It's center is at (-1,0) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at (-1,$3\sqrt{2}$) and (-1, -$3\sqrt{2}$). Find the equation of the hyperbola.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of the hyperbola, we need to determine its standard form and parameters. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. **Identify the type of hyperbola**: The hyperbola is centered at \((-1, 0)\), which means it opens vertically (upward and downward).

2. **Vertices**: The vertices are at \((-1, 3)\) and \((-1, -3)\). This tells us that the distance from the center to each vertex is \(3\) units.

3. **Foci**: The foci are at \((-1, 3\sqrt{2})\) and \((-1, -3\sqrt{2})\). The distance from the center to each focus is \(3\sqrt{2}\) units.

4. **Standard form**: The standard form of a hyperbola that opens vertically is:
   \[
   \frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1
   \]
   where \((h, k)\) is the center, \(a\) is the distance from the center to each vertex, and \(b\) is related to the foci by the relationship \(c^2 = a^2 + b^2\).

5. **Calculate \(a\) and \(c\)**:
   \[
   a = 3 \quad \text{(distance from center to each vertex)}
   \]
   \[
   c = 3\sqrt{2} \quad \text{(distance from center to each focus)}
   \]

6. **Find \(b\)**:
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2
   \]
   \[
   (3\sqrt{2})^2 = 3^2 + b^2
   \]
   \[
   18 = 9 + b^2
   \]
   \[
   b^2 = 9
   \]
   \[
   b = 3
   \]

7. **Substitute into the standard form**:
   \[
   \frac{(y - 0)^2}{3^2} - \frac{(x + 1)^2}{3^2} = 1
   \]
   \[
   \frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{(x + 1)^2}{9} = 1
   \]

Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{(x + 1)^2}{9} = 1}
\]
