QUESTION:
Given the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at -0.5 and -3.5 and with y-axis at 2, determine its equation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the equation of the ellipse, we start by identifying the standard form of the ellipse equation, which is:

\[
\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

where \((h, k)\) is the center of the ellipse, \(a\) is the semi-major axis, and \(b\) is the semi-minor axis.

From the given points:
- The ellipse intersects the x-axis at \((-0.5, 0)\) and \((-3.5, 0)\). This means the center of the ellipse is halfway between these two points, i.e., \(h = \frac{-0.5 + (-3.5)}{2} = -2\).
- The ellipse intersects the y-axis at \((0, 2)\), so \(k = 2\).

Now, we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\):
- The distance from the center to each x-intercept gives us the semi-major axis length \(a\). Since the center is at \((-2, 2)\), the distance from the center to each x-intercept is:
  \[
  a = |(-0.5) - (-2)| = |-0.5 + 2| = 1.5
  \]
- The distance from the center to the y-intercept gives us the semi-minor axis length \(b\). Since the center is at \((-2, 2)\), the distance from the center to the y-intercept is:
  \[
  b = |2 - 2| = 2
  \]

Thus, the equation of the ellipse is:
\[
\frac{(x + 2)^2}{1.5^2} + \frac{(y - 2)^2}{2^2} = 1
\]

Simplifying the constants:
\[
\frac{(x + 2)^2}{2.25} + \frac{(y - 2)^2}{4} = 1
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
Final Answer: \(\boxed{\frac{(x + 2)^2}{2.25} + \frac{(y - 2)^2}{4} = 1}\)
