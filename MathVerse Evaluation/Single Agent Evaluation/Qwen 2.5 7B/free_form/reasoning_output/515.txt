QUESTION:
The graph shows the amount of water remaining in a bucket that was initially full before a hole was made in its side. What is the slope of the shown function that passes (0, 30)?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the slope of the function shown in the graph, we need to find the rate at which the quantity of water decreases over time. The slope \( m \) of a linear function can be calculated using the formula:

\[ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \]

From the graph, we can see two points: (0, 30) and (40, 8). Here, the x-axis represents time in minutes and the y-axis represents the quantity of water in litres.

First, calculate the change in quantity (\( \Delta y \)):

\[ \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 = 8 - 30 = -22 \]

Next, calculate the change in time (\( \Delta x \)):

\[ \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 = 40 - 0 = 40 \]

Now, compute the slope \( m \):

\[ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{-22}{40} = -\frac{11}{20} \]

Final Answer: $-\frac{11}{20}$
