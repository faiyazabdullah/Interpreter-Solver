QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the figure shown. The trapezoid surface has edges of 9cm, 12cm and 5cm. The height is 3 cm.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the given geometric figure, we need to break it down into simpler shapes whose areas we can calculate.

1. **Identify the shapes**: The figure appears to be a combination of a rectangle and a right triangle.
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are \(12 \, \text{cm}\) by \(5 \, \text{cm}\).
   - There is a right triangle attached to the rectangle with one leg along the base of the rectangle (\(5 \, \text{cm}\)) and the other leg along the height of the triangle (\(3 \, \text{cm}\)).

2. **Calculate the area of the rectangle**:
   \[
   \text{Area of rectangle} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 12 \, \text{cm} \times 5 \, \text{cm} = 60 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the right triangle**:
   \[
   \text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \, \text{cm} \times 3 \, \text{cm} = 7.5 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

4. **Sum the areas**:
   \[
   \text{Total surface area} = \text{Area of rectangle} + \text{Area of triangle} = 60 \, \text{cm}^2 + 7.5 \, \text{cm}^2 = 67.5 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

Thus, the surface area of the figure is \(67.5 \, \text{cm}^2\).

Final Answer: $67.5 \, \text{cm}^2$
