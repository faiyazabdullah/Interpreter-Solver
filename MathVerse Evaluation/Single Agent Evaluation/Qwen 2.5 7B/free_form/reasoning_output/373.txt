QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 30Â°, the marked right angled side has a length of 8.5, and the diagonal side has a length of P. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown P.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. We have a right-angled triangle with one angle marked as \(30^\circ\). The side opposite to the \(30^\circ\) angle is given as \(8.5\).
2. In a right-angled triangle where one angle is \(30^\circ\), the side opposite to the \(30^\circ\) angle is half the hypotenuse. This is because in a \(30^\circ-60^\circ-90^\circ\) triangle, the sides are in the ratio \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\).
3. Let's denote the hypotenuse by \(P\). According to the ratio, the side opposite the \(30^\circ\) angle is \( \frac{P}{2} \). Given that this side is \(8.5\), we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{P}{2} = 8.5
   \]
4. Solving for \(P\):
   \[
   P = 8.5 \times 2 = 17
   \]

Thus, the length of the hypotenuse \(P\) is \(17\).

Final Answer: $P = 17$
