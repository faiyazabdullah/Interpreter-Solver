QUESTION:
Consider the triangular prism below. Lengths of AB, CF are 10, 4, 15. EX and XF have same length.
Find the length of CX correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for the length of \( CX \), we need to analyze the given triangle \( \triangle ECF \). We know that \( EX \) and \( XF \) are equal, and we are given the lengths of \( AB = 10 \) and \( CF = 4 \).

Since \( EX = XF \), point \( X \) is the midpoint of \( EF \). Therefore, \( FX = \frac{EF}{2} \).

Given \( EF = 15 \):
\[ FX = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \]

Now, let's consider the right triangle \( \triangle CFX \). In this triangle, \( CX \) is the unknown side opposite the angle at \( F \). The Pythagorean theorem can be applied here:
\[ CF^2 + FX^2 = CX^2 \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ 4^2 + 7.5^2 = CX^2 \]
\[ 16 + 56.25 = CX^2 \]
\[ 72.25 = CX^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[ CX = \sqrt{72.25} \approx 8.5 \]

Thus, the length of \( CX \) is approximately \( 8.50 \).

Final Answer: $8.50$
