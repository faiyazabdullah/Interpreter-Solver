QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the cylindrical water tank is 3x and the radius of its base is 5x+3. The cylindrical water tank is leaking at a constant rate of 3\pi x litres per second (where x is a fixed unknown). If the water tank was initially full, calculate the amount of water remaining after \left(2x+2\right)^2 seconds. Give your simplified answer in expanded form.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much water remains in the cylindrical water tank after it has been leaking for \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds.

First, let's find the volume of the cylindrical water tank:

1. **Volume of the Cylinder**: 
   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r = 5x + 3 \) and \( h = 3x \).

   Substituting these values in:
   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (5x + 3)^2 (3x)
   \]

   Expanding \((5x + 3)^2\):
   \[
   (5x + 3)^2 = 25x^2 + 30x + 9
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (25x^2 + 30x + 9) (3x) = \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x)
   \]

2. **Rate of Leakage**:
   The water leaks at a constant rate of \(3\pi x\) liters per second.

3. **Time of Leakage**:
   The time for which the tank is leaking is \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds.

4. **Volume Leaked**:
   Volume leaked in \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds is:
   \[
   \text{Volume Leaked} = 3\pi x \cdot (2x + 2)^2
   \]

   Expanding \((2x + 2)^2\):
   \[
   (2x + 2)^2 = 4x^2 + 8x + 4
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Volume Leaked} = 3\pi x \cdot (4x^2 + 8x + 4) = 3\pi x (4x^2 + 8x + 4) = 12\pi x^3 + 24\pi x^2 + 12\pi x
   \]

5. **Volume Remaining**:
   The volume remaining in the tank is the initial volume minus the volume leaked:
   \[
   \text{Volume Remaining} = 75\pi x^3 + 90\pi x^2 + 27\pi x - (12\pi x^3 + 24\pi x^2 + 12\pi x)
   \]

   Simplifying:
   \[
   \text{Volume Remaining} = (75\pi x^3 - 12\pi x^3) + (90\pi x^2 - 24\pi x^2) + (27\pi x - 12\pi x) = 63\pi x^3 + 66\pi x^2 + 15\pi x
   \]

Thus, the volume of water remaining in the tank after \((2x + 2)^2\) seconds is:
\[
\boxed{63\pi x^3 + 66\pi x^2 + 15\pi x}
\]
