QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The curve in the image is a parabola that opens downwards since it has a maximum point at $(0,2)$ and touches the x-axis at $(-4,0)$ and $(4,0)$.

2. **Determine the Domain**: The curve spans from $x=-4$ to $x=4$. Therefore, the domain is all real numbers between $-4$ and $4$, inclusive. In interval notation, this is $[-4, 4]$.

3. **Determine the Range**: The maximum value of the function is at the vertex where $y=2$, and the minimum values occur at the points where the curve intersects the x-axis, which are $y=0$. Thus, the range is all real numbers from $0$ to $2$, inclusive. In interval notation, this is $[0, 2]$.

Now, putting these into the required format:

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } [-4, 4], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\text{Domain: } [-4, 4], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 2]$
