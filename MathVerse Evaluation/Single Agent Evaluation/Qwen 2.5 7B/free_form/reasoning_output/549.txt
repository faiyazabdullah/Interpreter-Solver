QUESTION:
Takoda is watching the tides off the coast of Cape Cod. For two days, Takoda records the height of the water, $h$, in feet. His results are shown in the graph below, where $t$ corresponds to the number of hours after 12:00 a.m. According to Takoda's research, approximately how much time passes between two consecutive high tides?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the time that passes between two consecutive high tides from the given graph:

1. **Examine the graph:** The graph shows the height \( h \) of the water over time \( t \).
2. **Identify high tides:** High tides occur at the peaks of each cycle.
3. **Locate the first high tide:** The first high tide occurs at \( t = 0 \).
4. **Locate the second high tide:** The second high tide occurs at \( t = 8 \).
5. **Calculate the time difference:** The time difference between the first and the second high tide is \( 8 - 0 = 8 \) hours.

Thus, the time that passes between two consecutive high tides is \( 8 \) hours.

Final Answer: $8 \text{ hours}$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $8 \text{ hours}$
