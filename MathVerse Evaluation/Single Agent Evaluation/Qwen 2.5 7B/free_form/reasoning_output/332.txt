QUESTION:
Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 50Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \), we need to determine the direction angle from north to the line \( PM \).

1. **Identify the given information**: The angle \( \angle PMS \) is given as \( 50^\circ \). This angle is measured from the south cardinal point \( S \) towards point \( M \).

2. **Understand the bearing concept**: True bearing is the angle measured clockwise from the north direction. Since the angle \( \angle PMS \) is measured from the south, we need to add \( 90^\circ \) to convert it to a bearing from north.

3. **Calculate the bearing**:
   \[
   \text{True Bearing} = 90^\circ + 50^\circ = 140^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \) is:

Final Answer: \( \boxed{140^\circ} \)
