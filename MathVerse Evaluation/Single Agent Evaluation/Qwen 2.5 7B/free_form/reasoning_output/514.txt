QUESTION:
The graph shows the temperature of a room after the heater has been turned on. What is the slope of the shown function that passes the point (0, 1)?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the slope of the line passing through the point (0, 1), we need to determine the rate of change of temperature with respect to time. The graph shows a linear relationship between temperature and time, which can be described by the equation of a line \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

From the graph:
- The y-intercept \( b \) is 1 (since the line crosses the y-axis at 1).
- The line passes through the point (0, 1) and another point, such as (20, 5).

We can calculate the slope \( m \) using the formula for the slope between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):

\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Substituting the given points (0, 1) and (20, 5):

\[ m = \frac{5 - 1}{20 - 0} = \frac{4}{20} = \frac{1}{5} \]

Thus, the slope of the line is \(\frac{1}{5}\).

Final Answer: \( \frac{1}{5} \)
