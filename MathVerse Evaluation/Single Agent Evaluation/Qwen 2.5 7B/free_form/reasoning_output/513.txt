QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -1.5 and the y-intercept is 3. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's start by finding the equation of the line.

Given:
- The x-intercept is -1.5.
- The y-intercept is 3.

Using the intercept form of a line equation, which is \( \frac{x}{a} + \frac{y}{b} = 1 \), where \( a \) is the x-intercept and \( b \) is the y-intercept, we can substitute the given values:

\[ \frac{x}{-1.5} + \frac{y}{3} = 1 \]

To simplify this, we can clear the fractions by multiplying every term by -1.5 * 3:

\[ -1.5 \cdot \left( \frac{x}{-1.5} + \frac{y}{3} \right) = -1.5 \cdot 1 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x - 0.5y = -1.5 \]

Next, we need to determine the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane. The shaded region is below the line \( y = 2x + 3 \). To express this as an inequality, we rearrange the equation \( x - 0.5y = -1.5 \):

\[ 0.5y = x + 1.5 \]
\[ y = 2x + 3 \]

The shaded region is below this line, so the inequality is:

\[ y < 2x + 3 \]

Final Answer: $y < 2x + 3$
