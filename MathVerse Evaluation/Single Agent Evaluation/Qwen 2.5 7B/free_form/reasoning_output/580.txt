QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which Lucy forgot her content over time. Given the graph, we observe that both Maximilian and Lucy experience a decrease in their ability to recall content over time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Graph**:
   - The x-axis represents the number of days.
   - The y-axis represents the percentage of content recalled.
   - Maximilian's line is represented by the black curve.
   - Lucy's line is represented by the gray curve.

2. **Rate of Forgetting**:
   - Maximilian's forgetting rate is given as \(15\%\) per day, meaning he retains \(85\%\) of the content from the previous day.
   - For Lucy, we need to determine the percentage of content she retains each day.

3. **Identifying the Retention Rate**:
   - From the graph, we can see that Lucy's retention rate decreases more slowly than Maximilian's.
   - Maximilian’s retention rate is consistent at \(85\%\).
   - Lucy’s retention rate appears to be approximately \(90\%\) initially, which means she retains \(90\%\) of the content from the previous day.

4. **Calculating the Forgetting Rate**:
   - If Lucy retains \(90\%\) of the content, then she forgets \(10\%\) of the content each day.

### Final Answer:
The percentage of the previous day's content that Lucy forgot each day is:

Final Answer: \(10\%\)
