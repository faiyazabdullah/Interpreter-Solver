QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, shown below.

Complete the statement.

Every point on the circle is exactly _ units away from the point

( _ , _ ).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the center and radius of the circle.

1. **Identify the center of the circle:**
   The center of the circle is the point where the circle intersects the axes at equal distances. From the graph, we can see that the center is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

2. **Determine the radius of the circle:**
   The radius is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. By examining the graph, we can see that the circle intersects the y-axis at \(y = 5\) and \(y = -5\), indicating a radius of 5 units.

Given these observations, every point on the circle is exactly 5 units away from the point \((0, 0)\).

Final Answer: $5$
