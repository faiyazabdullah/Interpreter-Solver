QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the composite figure shown, which consists of a cone and a hemisphere joined at their bases. The radius is 4 cm. The perpendicular height of cone is 10cm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the surface area of the composite figure consisting of a cone and a hemisphere joined at their bases. The radius of both the cone and the hemisphere is given as 4 cm, and the perpendicular height of the cone is 10 cm.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

#### Step 1: Calculate the Slant Height of the Cone
The slant height (\( l \)) of the cone can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \]
where \( r = 4 \) cm and \( h = 10 \) cm.
\[ l = \sqrt{4^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{16 + 100} = \sqrt{116} = 2\sqrt{29} \]

#### Step 2: Calculate the Surface Area of the Hemisphere
The surface area of a hemisphere (excluding the base) is given by:
\[ \text{Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2 \]
where \( r = 4 \) cm.
\[ \text{Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi (4)^2 = 2\pi \times 16 = 32\pi \]

#### Step 3: Calculate the Lateral Surface Area of the Cone
The lateral surface area of a cone is given by:
\[ \text{Lateral Surface Area of Cone} = \pi r l \]
where \( r = 4 \) cm and \( l = 2\sqrt{29} \) cm.
\[ \text{Lateral Surface Area of Cone} = \pi \times 4 \times 2\sqrt{29} = 8\pi\sqrt{29} \]

#### Step 4: Add the Surface Areas
The total surface area of the composite figure is the sum of the lateral surface area of the cone and the surface area of the hemisphere.
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 32\pi + 8\pi\sqrt{29} \]

#### Step 5: Simplify and Round the Final Answer
We can factor out \( \pi \) from the expression:
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = \pi (32 + 8\sqrt{29}) \]

Now, let's calculate the numerical value:
\[ 32 + 8\sqrt{29} \approx 32 + 8 \times 5.385 \approx 32 + 43.08 \approx 75.08 \]

So, the total surface area is:
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = \pi \times 75.08 \approx 235.84 \text{ cm}^2 \]

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: $235.84\pi \text{ cm}^2$
