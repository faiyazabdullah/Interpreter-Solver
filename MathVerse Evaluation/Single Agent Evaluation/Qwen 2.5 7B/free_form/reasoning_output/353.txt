QUESTION:
An airplane is currently flying 35^\circ  south of east, as shown in the image.

The control tower orders the plane to change course by turning 7^\circ  to the left. How many degrees south of east is the new course that the plane is ordered to fly?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Course Direction**: The airplane is initially flying at $35^\circ$ south of east.
2. **Turning Left**: The control tower orders the plane to turn $7^\circ$ to the left.

To find the new direction, we need to subtract the angle of the turn from the initial angle:
\[ 35^\circ - 7^\circ = 28^\circ \]

The plane is now flying at $28^\circ$ south of east.

Final Answer: $28^\circ$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $28^\circ$
