QUESTION:
Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

If the graph is translated 10 units up, what will be the coordinates of the new $y$-intercept?

State the coordinates in the form $(a, b)$.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's follow these steps:

1. Identify the original equation of the line.
   The equation provided is \( y = 4 - x \).

2. Determine the y-intercept of the original line.
   The y-intercept occurs where \( x = 0 \).
   Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the equation \( y = 4 - x \):
   \[
   y = 4 - 0 = 4
   \]
   So, the y-intercept is \( (0, 4) \).

3. Translate the graph 10 units up.
   Translating a function \( y = f(x) \) upwards by \( k \) units results in the new function \( y = f(x) + k \).
   Here, we translate the line \( y = 4 - x \) upwards by 10 units:
   \[
   y = (4 - x) + 10 = 4 - x + 10 = 14 - x
   \]

4. Find the new y-intercept of the translated line.
   The new equation is \( y = 14 - x \).
   To find the y-intercept, set \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   y = 14 - 0 = 14
   \]
   Therefore, the new y-intercept is \( (0, 14) \).

Final Answer: \( (0, 14) \)
