QUESTION:
A cylinder with a radius of 2.5cm and a height of 10cm contains two identical spherical balls that fit exactly inside it. What is the surface area of each ball? Give your answer correct to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of each spherical ball, we need to first determine the radius of the sphere. Since the two spheres fit exactly inside the cylinder, the diameter of each sphere is equal to the diameter of the cylinder's base.

1. **Determine the diameter of the sphere:**
   The radius of the cylinder is \(2.5 \text{ cm}\). Therefore, the diameter of the cylinder is:
   \[
   \text{Diameter of the cylinder} = 2 \times 2.5 = 5 \text{ cm}
   \]
   Since the two spheres fit exactly inside the cylinder, the diameter of each sphere is also \(5 \text{ cm}\).

2. **Calculate the radius of the sphere:**
   The radius \(r\) of each sphere is half of the diameter:
   \[
   r = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \text{ cm}
   \]

3. **Use the formula for the surface area of a sphere:**
   The surface area \(A\) of a sphere is given by:
   \[
   A = 4 \pi r^2
   \]
   Substituting \(r = 2.5 \text{ cm}\):
   \[
   A = 4 \pi (2.5)^2
   \]
   Calculate \((2.5)^2\):
   \[
   (2.5)^2 = 6.25
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   A = 4 \pi \times 6.25 = 25 \pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

4. **Round the result to one decimal place:**
   \[
   25 \pi \approx 78.5
   \]

Thus, the surface area of each sphere is approximately \(78.5 \text{ cm}^2\).

Final Answer: $78.5 \text{ cm}^2$
