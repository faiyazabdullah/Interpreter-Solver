QUESTION:
This box is to have a divider placed in as shown. The box has sides of length 19 cm, 10 cm and 7 cm.
Calculate the area of the divider correct to two decimal places, using your rounded answer from the previous part.

FINAL RESPONSE:

To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the triangular face of the box that acts as the divider. Let's break down the steps:

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the dimensions:**
   - The dimensions of the box are \(19 \, \text{cm}\), \(10 \, \text{cm}\), and \(7 \, \text{cm}\).

2. **Determine the type of triangle:**
   - The triangle formed by the divider will be a right triangle because one of its sides lies along the edge of the box.

3. **Identify the base and height:**
   - The base of the triangle is one of the edges of the box, say \(19 \, \text{cm}\).
   - The height of the triangle can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the other two sides of the box.

4. **Calculate the height:**
   - Consider the triangle with the hypotenuse as the diagonal of the base and top faces of the box.
   - The diagonal of the base face is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     \text{Diagonal of base face} = \sqrt{19^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{361 + 100} = \sqrt{461} \, \text{cm}
     \]
   - This diagonal is the hypotenuse of the right triangle we are considering.

5. **Area of the triangle:**
   - The area \(A\) of a right triangle is given by:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Here, the base is \(19 \, \text{cm}\) and the height is the perpendicular distance from the base to the top of the box, which is the height of the box, \(7 \, \text{cm}\).

6. **Substitute the values:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 19 \, \text{cm} \times 7 \, \text{cm} = \frac{1}{2} \times 133 \, \text{cm}^2 = 66.5 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

### Final Answer:

The area of the divider is \(66.5 \, \text{cm}^2\).

Final Answer: $\boxed{66.5 \, \text{cm}^2}$
