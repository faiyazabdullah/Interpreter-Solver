QUESTION:
The side profile of a bridge is overlapped with the coordinate axes such that $(x, y)$ represents a point on the arc that is $x$ meters horizontally from one end of the bridge and $y$ meters vertically above the road. The bridge meets the road at coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(100,0)$, with the vertex at (50,50).

Pedestrians are able to climb the full arch of the bridge. Find the average steepness of the climb over the interval $[0,20]$.

To find the average steepness of the climb over the interval \( [0, 20] \), we need to determine the slope of the curve over that specific range.

Given:
- The curve is a parabola opening downwards with its vertex at \((50, 50)\).
- The curve meets the road at \((0,0)\) and \((100,0)\).

The equation of a parabola in standard form can be written as:
\[ y = a(x-h)^2 + k \]
where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola. Here, the vertex is \((50, 50)\), so:
\[ y = a(x-50)^2 + 50 \]

Since the parabola passes through the points \((0,0)\) and \((100,0)\), we can substitute these into the equation to find \(a\):
For \((0,0)\):
\[ 0 = a(0-50)^2 + 50 \]
\[ 0 = 2500a + 50 \]
\[ 2500a = -50 \]
\[ a = -\frac{1}{50} \]

So the equation of the parabola is:
\[ y = -\frac{1}{50}(x-50)^2 + 50 \]

We need to find the slope of the tangent line to the parabola at any point \(x\) in the interval \([0, 20]\). The slope of the tangent line at a point \(x\) is given by the derivative of the function \(y\) with respect to \(x\):
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{1}{50} \cdot 2(x-50) = -\frac{1}{25}(x-50) \]

The average steepness over the interval \([0, 20]\) is the average value of the derivative over this interval. The average value of a function \(f(x)\) over an interval \([a, b]\) is given by:
\[ \text{Average Value} = \frac{1}{b-a} \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \]

Here, \(f(x) = -\frac{1}{25}(x-50)\), \(a = 0\), and \(b = 20\):
\[ \text{Average Steepness} = \frac{1}{20-0} \int_0^{20} -\frac{1}{25}(x-50) \, dx \]
\[ = \frac{1}{20} \left[ -\frac{1}{25} \cdot \frac{(x-50)^2}{2} \right]_0^{20} \]
\[ = \frac{1}{20} \left[ -\frac{1}{50}(x-50)^2 \right]_0^{20} \]
\[ = \frac{1}{20} \left( -\frac{1}{50}(20-50)^2 + \frac{1}{50}(0-50)^2 \right) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{20} \left( -\frac{1}{50}(30)^2 + \frac{1}{50}(50)^2 \right) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{20} \left( -\frac{1}{50} \cdot 900 + \frac{1}{50} \cdot 2500 \right) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{20} \left( -18 + 50 \right) \]
\[ = \frac{1}{20} \cdot 32 \]
\[ = 1.6 \]

Final Answer: $1.6$
