QUESTION:
In rectangle ABDF above, point C lies on side BD,point E lies on side DF, C and E are midpoints of sides BD and DF, respectively. What fraction of the area of the rectangle is shaded?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given problem:

1. The rectangle \(ABDF\) has points \(C\) and \(E\) such that \(C\) is the midpoint of \(BD\) and \(E\) is the midpoint of \(DF\).
2. We need to find the fraction of the area of the rectangle that is shaded.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Midpoints**:
   - Since \(C\) is the midpoint of \(BD\), \(BC = CD\).
   - Since \(E\) is the midpoint of \(DF\), \(DE = EF\).

2. **Divide the Rectangle**:
   - The rectangle \(ABDF\) can be divided into four smaller triangles:
     - \(\triangle ABC\)
     - \(\triangle CDE\)
     - \(\triangle CEF\)
     - \(\triangle AEF\)

3. **Calculate the Areas**:
   - Let the length of \(AB = l\) and the width of \(AD = w\). Thus, the area of the rectangle \(ABDF\) is \(A = lw\).
   - Since \(C\) and \(E\) are midpoints, the triangles are similar and their areas are proportional to the squares of their corresponding sides.

4. **Area Proportions**:
   - The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is half of the area of \(\triangle ABD\), which is half of the rectangle.
   - Similarly, the area of \(\triangle CDE\) is half of the area of \(\triangle BDC\), which is also half of the rectangle.
   - The area of \(\triangle CEF\) is half of the area of \(\triangle CFD\), which is also half of the rectangle.
   - The area of \(\triangle AEF\) is half of the area of \(\triangle ADF\), which is also half of the rectangle.

5. **Shaded Area Calculation**:
   - The shaded region includes \(\triangle CEF\).
   - The area of \(\triangle CEF\) is one-fourth of the area of the rectangle because it occupies one-fourth of the area of the rectangle due to its position and size relative to the midpoints.

Thus, the fraction of the area of the rectangle that is shaded is:
\[
\frac{1}{4}
\]

Final Answer: $ \frac{1}{4} $
