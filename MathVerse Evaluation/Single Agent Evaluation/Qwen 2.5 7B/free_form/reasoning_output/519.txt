QUESTION:
The function $f(x)=5 x-x^2$ in blue gives the number of mosquitos in the forest (in millions), and the function $g(x)=3 x-0.5 x^2$ in red gives the number of bats (in millions). In both equations $x$ represents rainfall (in centimeters). $g(x)$ goes through (0,0), (3,6), (6,0) and opens downward. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,0), (2,6), (3,6), (5,0) and opens downsward. When there is $0 \mathrm{~cm}$ of rainfall, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats. What is another rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats?
Round your answer to the nearest half centimeter.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the point where the number of mosquitoes is equal to the number of bats. This means solving the equation \( f(x) = g(x) \):

\[ 5x - x^2 = 3x - 0.5x^2 \]

First, simplify the equation:

\[ 5x - x^2 = 3x - 0.5x^2 \]
\[ 5x - x^2 - 3x + 0.5x^2 = 0 \]
\[ 2x - 0.5x^2 = 0 \]
\[ x(2 - 0.5x) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad 2 - 0.5x = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4 \]

Since \( x = 0 \) corresponds to the initial condition where there is no rainfall and the number of mosquitoes is the same as the number of bats, we need to find the other solution.

Thus, the other rainfall amount where the number of mosquitoes is the same as the number of bats is \( 4 \).

Final Answer: $4$
