QUESTION:
Consider the following figure.Find the total surface area of the triangular prism shown. The height is 16cm. The base is an isosceles triangle with waist length of 10cm and base length of 12cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the total surface area of the triangular prism, we need to calculate the area of the two triangular bases and the lateral surface area.

First, let's find the area of one triangular base. The base is an isosceles triangle with a base of \(12 \text{ cm}\) and legs of \(10 \text{ cm}\). We can split this triangle into two right triangles by drawing a perpendicular from the apex to the midpoint of the base. This gives us a right triangle with hypotenuse \(10 \text{ cm}\), one leg of \(6 \text{ cm}\) (half of the base), and the other leg of \(x\) (the height of the triangle).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ x = \sqrt{10^2 - 6^2} = \sqrt{100 - 36} = \sqrt{64} = 8 \text{ cm} \]

The area of one triangular base is:
\[ \text{Area of one base} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 8 = 48 \text{ cm}^2 \]
Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:
\[ 2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Next, we calculate the lateral surface area. The lateral surface consists of three rectangles: two with dimensions \(16 \text{ cm} \times 10 \text{ cm}\) and one with dimensions \(16 \text{ cm} \times 8 \text{ cm}\).

The area of each rectangle is:
\[ 16 \times 10 = 160 \text{ cm}^2 \]
\[ 16 \times 8 = 128 \text{ cm}^2 \]
So, the total lateral surface area is:
\[ 2 \times 160 + 128 = 320 + 128 = 448 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Adding the areas of the bases and the lateral surface gives the total surface area:
\[ 96 + 448 = 544 \text{ cm}^2 \]

Final Answer: $544 \text{ cm}^2$
