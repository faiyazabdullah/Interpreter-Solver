QUESTION:
The solid shown is constructed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube. Find its surface area if the side length is 14.2 and the radius is half that.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the surface area of the solid formed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions**:
   - The side length of the cube is \( 14.2 \, \text{cm} \).
   - The radius of the sphere is half of the side length of the cube, which is \( \frac{14.2}{2} = 7.1 \, \text{cm} \).

2. **Surface Area Calculation**:
   - The surface area of the cube is \( 6a^2 \), where \( a \) is the side length of the cube.
   - The surface area of the quarter sphere is calculated as follows:
     - The surface area of a full sphere is \( 4\pi r^2 \).
     - Since we are dealing with a quarter of the sphere, the surface area is \( \frac{4\pi r^2}{4} = \pi r^2 \).

3. **Calculate the individual components**:
   - The surface area of the cube is \( 6 \times (14.2)^2 \).
   - The surface area of the quarter sphere is \( \pi \times (7.1)^2 \).

4. **Subtract the overlapping area**:
   - The overlapping area is the area of the circular face of the sphere, which is \( \pi r^2 \).

Let's calculate these values step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the surface area of the cube
\[ \text{Cube Surface Area} = 6 \times (14.2)^2 = 6 \times 201.64 = 1209.84 \, \text{cm}^2 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the surface area of the quarter sphere
\[ \text{Quarter Sphere Surface Area} = \pi \times (7.1)^2 = \pi \times 50.41 = 158.31\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the overlapping area
The overlapping area is the same as the surface area of the quarter sphere because it is being cut out from the top face of the cube:
\[ \text{Overlapping Area} = 158.31\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total surface area of the solid
The total surface area is the sum of the surface area of the cube minus the overlapping area:
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 1209.84 - 158.31\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \]

Finally, we express this in LaTeX format:
Final Answer: $1209.84 - 158.31\pi \, \text{cm}^2$
