QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a scaled version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the equation for \( g(x) \), we need to observe the transformation applied to the function \( f(x) = x^2 \). 

From the graph, we can see that the parabola \( g(x) \) is a vertical stretch of the parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \). The point \((2, 3)\) on \( g(x) \) suggests that the vertex of \( g(x) \) is at the origin \((0,0)\), and the parabola opens upwards similarly to \( f(x) = x^2 \), but scaled vertically.

Given that the point \((2, 3)\) lies on the graph of \( g(x) \), we can set up the following relationship:

\[ g(2) = 3 \]

Since \( g(x) \) is a vertical stretch of \( f(x) = x^2 \), the general form of \( g(x) \) can be written as:

\[ g(x) = k \cdot f(x) = k \cdot x^2 \]

We substitute the known point \((2, 3)\) into the equation to find \( k \):

\[ g(2) = k \cdot 2^2 = 3 \]
\[ 4k = 3 \]
\[ k = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the equation for \( g(x) \) is:

\[ g(x) = \frac{3}{4} x^2 \]

Final Answer: $g(x) = \frac{3}{4} x^2$
