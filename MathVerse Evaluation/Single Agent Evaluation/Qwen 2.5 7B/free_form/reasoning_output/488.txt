QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,1), (-1,3), and (0,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing, we need to analyze the graph:

1. **Identify the critical points**: The function changes direction at its critical points, where the derivative is zero or undefined. In this case, we can see that the function has a peak at approximately \(x = -2\) and a trough at approximately \(x = 0\).

2. **Determine the intervals**:
   - **Decreasing Interval**: The function decreases from left to right until it reaches the peak at \(x = -2\).
   - **Increasing Interval**: The function increases from \(x = -2\) to the point where it reaches the trough at \(x = 0\).
   - **Increasing Interval**: After \(x = 0\), the function continues to increase to the right.

Given these observations, we can write the intervals as follows:
- The function is decreasing on \((- \infty, -2)\).
- The function is increasing on \((-2, 0)\).
- The function is increasing on \((0, \infty)\).

Final Answer: $(-\infty, -2), \quad (-2, 0), \quad (0, \infty)$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $(-\infty, -2), \quad (-2, 0), \quad (0, \infty)$
