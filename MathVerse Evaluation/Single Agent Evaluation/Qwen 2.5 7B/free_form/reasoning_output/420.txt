QUESTION:
The perimeter is equal to the sum of the four side lengths of the trapezium. Find the length of the missing side of the trapezium shown.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The trapezium has one parallel side of 10 cm.
   - There is a perpendicular line from one vertex to the opposite side, forming a right angle, measuring 6 cm.
   - We need to find the length of the other parallel side.

2. **Understand the geometry:**
   - The trapezium can be split into a rectangle and two right triangles.
   - The height of the trapezium is 6 cm, which is the same as the height of the two right triangles.
   - The base of each right triangle can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem.

3. **Calculate the bases of the right triangles:**
   - Let's assume the trapezium is divided into a rectangle of width \(w\) and two right triangles on either side.
   - The total width of the trapezium is \(w + 10 + w = 2w + 10\).
   - Since the height of the right triangles is 6 cm and they form a right angle with the bottom base of the trapezium, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(w\):
     \[
     w^2 + 6^2 = 10^2
     \]
     \[
     w^2 + 36 = 100
     \]
     \[
     w^2 = 64
     \]
     \[
     w = 8
     \]

4. **Determine the lengths of the other parallel sides:**
   - The length of the other parallel side is \(2 \times 8 + 10 = 26\) cm.

5. **Sum the perimeter:**
   - The perimeter of the trapezium is the sum of all its sides:
     \[
     10 + 26 + 26 + 26 = 98 \text{ cm}
     \]

Therefore, the length of the missing side of the trapezium is:

Final Answer: $26$
