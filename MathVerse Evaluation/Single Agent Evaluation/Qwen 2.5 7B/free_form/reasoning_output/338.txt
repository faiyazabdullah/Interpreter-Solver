QUESTION:
In the figure below, point B is due East of point A. We want to find the position of point A relative to point C. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 49° and angle B is 39°.

Find the true bearing of point A from point C.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the true bearing of point A from point C. The true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.

Given:
- Point B is due East of point A.
- Angle at A ($\angle A$) = $49^\circ$.
- Angle at B ($\angle B$) = $39^\circ$.
- Therefore, the angle at C ($\angle C$) can be calculated as:
\[ \angle C = 180^\circ - \angle A - \angle B = 180^\circ - 49^\circ - 39^\circ = 92^\circ \]

Since point B is directly East of point A, point A lies in the South-West quadrant relative to point C. To find the true bearing of point A from point C, we need to subtract $\angle A$ from $180^\circ$ because the angle $\angle A$ is measured from the South direction towards West.

Thus, the true bearing of point A from point C is:
\[ 180^\circ - 49^\circ = 131^\circ \]

Therefore, the true bearing of point A from point C is:
Final Answer: $131^\circ$
