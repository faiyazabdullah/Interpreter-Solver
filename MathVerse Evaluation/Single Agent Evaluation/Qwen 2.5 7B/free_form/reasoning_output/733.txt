QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the base is 14cm. The height of the prism is 3 cm. Find the volume of the prism.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the volume of the prism, we need to determine the area of its base and then multiply it by the height of the prism.

1. **Identify the shape and dimensions of the base:**
   The base of the prism appears to be a trapezoid. The heights of the two parallel sides are given as 7 cm each, and the distance between these parallel sides (the width of the trapezoid at the bottom) is 14 cm. The lengths of the two non-parallel sides are 5 cm and 3 cm respectively.

2. **Calculate the area of the trapezoid:**
   The formula for the area \(A\) of a trapezoid is:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times (b_1 + b_2) \times h
   \]
   where \(b_1\) and \(b_2\) are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and \(h\) is the height between these parallel sides.

   Here, \(b_1 = 14 \text{ cm}\), \(b_2 = 14 \text{ cm}\), and \(h = 7 \text{ cm}\).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times (14 + 14) \times 7 = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 \times 7 = 98 \text{ cm}^2
   \]

3. **Determine the height of the prism:**
   The height of the prism is given as 3 cm.

4. **Calculate the volume of the prism:**
   The volume \(V\) of a prism is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}
   \]
   Here, the base area is 98 cmÂ² and the height is 3 cm.

   Therefore:
   \[
   V = 98 \times 3 = 294 \text{ cm}^3
   \]

Final Answer: $V = 294 \text{ cm}^3$
