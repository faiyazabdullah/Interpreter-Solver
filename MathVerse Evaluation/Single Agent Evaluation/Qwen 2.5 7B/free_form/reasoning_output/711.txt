QUESTION:
The top of a solid cone was sawed off to form the solid attached. The top cone has a diameter of 8cm and slant height of 8cm. The solid cone has a diameter of 4cm. The solid left has a slant height of 8cm. Find the surface area of the solid formed, correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the surface area of the solid formed after cutting off the smaller cone from the larger one. We will break it down into calculating the surface areas of the lateral surfaces of both cones and then sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the dimensions:**
   - Larger cone:
     - Diameter of base \( D_1 = 8 \text{ cm} \)
     - Slant height \( l_1 = 8 \text{ cm} \)
     - Radius of base \( r_1 = \frac{D_1}{2} = 4 \text{ cm} \)

   - Smaller cone:
     - Diameter of base \( D_2 = 4 \text{ cm} \)
     - Slant height \( l_2 = 8 \text{ cm} \)
     - Radius of base \( r_2 = \frac{D_2}{2} = 2 \text{ cm} \)

2. **Calculate the lateral surface area of each cone:**

   The formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is:
   \[
   \text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi r l
   \]

   - Lateral surface area of the larger cone:
     \[
     A_{\text{large}} = \pi \times 4 \times 8 = 32\pi \text{ cm}^2
     \]

   - Lateral surface area of the smaller cone:
     \[
     A_{\text{small}} = \pi \times 2 \times 8 = 16\pi \text{ cm}^2
     \]

3. **Combine the lateral surface areas:**

   Since the smaller cone is removed from the larger cone, we subtract the lateral surface area of the smaller cone from the larger cone's lateral surface area:
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{large}} - A_{\text{small}} = 32\pi - 16\pi = 16\pi \text{ cm}^2
   \]

### Final Answer:

The surface area of the solid formed is:
\[
\boxed{16\pi}
\]
