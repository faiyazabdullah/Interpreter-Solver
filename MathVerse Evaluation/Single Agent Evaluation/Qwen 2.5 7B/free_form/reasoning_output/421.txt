QUESTION:
The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the remaining area after subtracting the known areas from the total area.

1. **Identify the total area and the known areas:**
   - The total area of the figure is given as \(6096\) square units.
   - The orange rectangle has dimensions \(1000\) units by \(6\) units, so its area is \(1000 \times 6 = 6000\) square units.
   - There is a small white square inside the rectangle, but its area is not provided directly in the image.

2. **Calculate the area of the white square:**
   - Since the white square is inside the rectangle and its position is not specified, we assume it is very small compared to the rest of the figure. However, the problem does not provide specific dimensions for the white square, so we cannot calculate its area directly from the image alone.

3. **Assuming the white square's area is negligible or zero for simplicity:**
   - If we consider the white square's area to be zero, then the remaining area would be the difference between the total area and the area of the orange rectangle.

4. **Calculate the remaining area:**
   - Remaining area = Total area - Area of the orange rectangle
   - Remaining area = \(6096 - 6000 = 96\) square units.

Given the assumptions and the problem constraints, the remaining area can be represented as:

Final Answer: $96$
