QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the average rate of change, we need to calculate the slope of the line connecting the two points on the graph. The formula for the slope \( m \) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:

\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

From the graph, the two points are approximately:
- \((x_1, y_1) = (5, 17)\)
- \((x_2, y_2) = (20, 25)\)

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ m = \frac{25 - 17}{20 - 5} = \frac{8}{15} \]

This value can be simplified further if needed, but for this context, it is already in its simplest form.

Final Answer: \( m = \frac{8}{15} \)

Final Answer: $m = \frac{8}{15}$
