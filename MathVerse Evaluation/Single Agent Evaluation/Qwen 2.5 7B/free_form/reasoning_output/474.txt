QUESTION:
There are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation, let's follow these steps:

1. **Identify the points on the number line:** The points marked are -2 and -1.
2. **Understand the representation:** Since there is a filled circle at -1, it indicates that -1 is included in the interval. There is an open circle at -2, which means -2 is not included.
3. **Determine the interval type:** Since the interval includes -1 but not -2, it is a half-open interval.
4. **Write the interval in interval notation:** The interval from -2 to -1, not including -2, can be written as $[-1, -2)$.

Final Answer: $[-1, -2)$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $[-1, -2)$
