QUESTION:
Consider the following rectangular prism with length width and height equal to 12 m, 6 m and 4 m respectively.

Find the surface area of the prism.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the rectangular prism, we need to calculate the area of each of its six faces and then sum these areas.

Given dimensions:
- Length (\(l\)) = \(12 \, \text{m}\)
- Width (\(w\)) = \(6 \, \text{m}\)
- Height (\(h\)) = \(4 \, \text{m}\)

The surface area (\(A\)) of a rectangular prism is given by the formula:
\[ A = 2(lw + lh + wh) \]

Let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the area of each pair of opposite faces:
   - The area of the two faces with dimensions \(l\) and \(w\) is \(2lw\).
   - The area of the two faces with dimensions \(l\) and \(h\) is \(2lh\).
   - The area of the two faces with dimensions \(w\) and \(h\) is \(2wh\).

2. Substitute the given values:
   - \(lw = 12 \times 6 = 72\)
   - \(lh = 12 \times 4 = 48\)
   - \(wh = 6 \times 4 = 24\)

3. Sum these products and multiply by 2:
   \[ A = 2(72 + 48 + 24) \]
   \[ A = 2(144) \]
   \[ A = 288 \, \text{m}^2 \]

Therefore, the surface area of the prism is:
Final Answer: $288 \, \text{m}^2$
