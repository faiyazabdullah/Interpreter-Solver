QUESTION:
Consider the following hemisphere with a radius of 8. Find the total surface area.

Round your answer to three decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the total surface area of the hemisphere, we need to consider both the curved surface area and the base area.

1. **Curved Surface Area**:
   The curved surface area \( A_{\text{curved}} \) of a hemisphere is half the surface area of a full sphere minus the base area of the hemisphere. The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is:
   \[
   A_{\text{curved}} = 2\pi r^2
   \]
   Here, the radius \( r \) is 8 cm.

2. **Base Area**:
   The base of the hemisphere is a circle with the same radius as the hemisphere. The area \( A_{\text{base}} \) of the base circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{base}} = \pi r^2
   \]

Now, let's calculate each part:

### Curved Surface Area Calculation:
\[
A_{\text{curved}} = 2\pi (8)^2 = 2\pi \times 64 = 128\pi
\]

### Base Area Calculation:
\[
A_{\text{base}} = \pi (8)^2 = \pi \times 64 = 64\pi
\]

### Total Surface Area Calculation:
The total surface area \( A_{\text{total}} \) of the hemisphere is the sum of the curved surface area and the base area:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{curved}} + A_{\text{base}} = 128\pi + 64\pi = 192\pi
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{192\pi}
\]
