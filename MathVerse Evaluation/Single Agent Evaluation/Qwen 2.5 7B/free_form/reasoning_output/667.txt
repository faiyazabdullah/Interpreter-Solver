QUESTION:
In this question we will find the surface area of the following solid hemispher with a radius of 6:

What is the area of the circular base of the hemisphere?

Round your answer to three decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the area of the circular base of the hemisphere, we need to use the formula for the area of a circle, which is \( A = \pi r^2 \), where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

From the image, the radius \( r \) of the circular base of the hemisphere is given as 6.

Let's calculate the area:

\[ A = \pi \times 6^2 \]
\[ A = \pi \times 36 \]
\[ A = 36\pi \]

Now, we round this value to three decimal places:

\[ 36\pi \approx 113.137 \]

Therefore, the area of the circular base of the hemisphere is approximately \( 113.137 \).

Final Answer: $113.137$
