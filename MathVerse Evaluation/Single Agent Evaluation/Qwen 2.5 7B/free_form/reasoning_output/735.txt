QUESTION:
As the solid shown in the figure, the seven marked edges have the same length. The height of the prism of 16 cm. Find the volume of the composite solid shown.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the structure**: The figure is composed of rectangular prisms stacked together. We need to find the dimensions of each rectangular prism.
2. **Identify the lengths**: The height of the largest prism is given as \(16\) cm. Let the length and width of the base of each prism be \(x\) and \(y\) respectively. Since there are three identical smaller prisms stacked on top of each other, the height of the entire structure is \(7 + 2x = 16\) cm.
3. **Solve for \(x\)**: 
   \[
   7 + 2x = 16 \implies 2x = 9 \implies x = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cm}
   \]
4. **Calculate the volume of the entire structure**: Each smaller prism has a volume of \(V_{\text{small}} = x \cdot y \cdot h_{\text{small}}\), where \(h_{\text{small}} = 7\) cm. The total volume \(V_{\text{total}}\) is the sum of the volumes of the three smaller prisms plus the volume of the largest prism.
5. **Determine the dimensions of the largest prism**: The largest prism has a height of \(16\) cm, so its base area is \(A_{\text{large}} = x \cdot y = 4.5 \cdot y\).
6. **Calculate the volume of the largest prism**:
   \[
   V_{\text{large}} = 4.5 \cdot y \cdot 16
   \]
7. **Calculate the volume of the smaller prisms**:
   \[
   V_{\text{small}} = 4.5 \cdot y \cdot 7
   \]
8. **Sum the volumes**:
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times V_{\text{small}} + V_{\text{large}}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times (4.5 \cdot y \cdot 7) + 4.5 \cdot y \cdot 16
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 31.5y + 72y = 94.5y + 72y = 166.5y
   \]

Since the problem does not specify the width \(y\), we assume it is a variable that can be determined from additional context. However, if we assume the width \(y\) is the same as the length \(x\) (which is a reasonable assumption given the symmetry), then \(y = 4.5\) cm.

Thus,
\[
V_{\text{total}} = 166.5 \times 4.5 = 749.25 \text{ cm}^3
\]

Final Answer: $749.25 \text{ cm}^3$
