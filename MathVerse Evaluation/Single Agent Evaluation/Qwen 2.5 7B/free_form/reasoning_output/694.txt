QUESTION:
Xavier's mother told him to drink 4 glasses of water each day. She gave him a cylindrical glass with radius 4 cm.

If Xavier follows this drinking routine for a week, how many litres of water would he drink altogether?

Round your answer to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the volume of one glass of water.
2. Determine the total number of glasses Xavier drinks in a week.
3. Convert the total volume from cubic centimeters to liters.
4. Round the final answer to one decimal place.

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of One Glass
The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height.

Given:
\[ r = 4 \, \text{cm} \]
\[ h = 11 \, \text{cm} \]

Substitute the values into the formula:
\[ V = \pi (4)^2 (11) = \pi \cdot 16 \cdot 11 = 176\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

### Step 2: Total Number of Glasses in a Week
Xavier drinks 4 glasses each day. There are 7 days in a week, so:
\[ \text{Total glasses} = 4 \times 7 = 28 \]

### Step 3: Total Volume of Water in Liters
First, calculate the total volume in cubic centimeters:
\[ \text{Total volume (cm}^3) = 28 \times 176\pi = 4928\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, convert cubic centimeters to liters (1 liter = 1000 cmÂ³):
\[ \text{Total volume (liters)} = \frac{4928\pi}{1000} = 4.928\pi \, \text{liters} \]

### Step 4: Round the Final Answer
Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[ 4.928\pi \approx 4.928 \times 3.14159 \approx 15.4616 \]

Rounded to one decimal place:
\[ 15.5 \, \text{liters} \]

Final Answer: $15.5$
