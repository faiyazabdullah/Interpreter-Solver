QUESTION:
Consider the circle on the graph. Its center is at (1,3) and its radius is 6.

Find the equation of the circle in standard form.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of the circle in standard form, we start with the general formula for the equation of a circle:

\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]

where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \(r\) is the radius.

From the image, we can see that:
- The center of the circle \((h, k)\) is at \((1, 3)\).
- The radius \(r\) is given as 6.

Substituting these values into the general equation, we get:

\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 6^2
\]

Next, we calculate \(6^2\):

\[
6^2 = 36
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36
\]

Therefore, the equation of the circle in standard form is:

Final Answer: $$(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36$$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $$(x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36$$
