QUESTION:
The graph consists of the rectangle QRPS and the line segment RT, and the point T is on PS. The area of triangle RST is 7 and PT=2/5*PS. What is the area of PQRS?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the area of rectangle \(PQRS\) given the area of triangle \(RST\) and the relationship between the segments \(PT\) and \(PS\).

Step 1: Understand the given information.
- The area of triangle \(RST\) is 7.
- \(PT = \frac{2}{5} \times PS\).

Step 2: Express \(PS\) in terms of \(PT\).
Let \(PS = x\). Then \(PT = \frac{2}{5}x\).

Step 3: Calculate \(TS\).
Since \(T\) lies on \(PS\), \(TS = PS - PT = x - \frac{2}{5}x = \frac{3}{5}x\).

Step 4: Use the area of triangle \(RST\).
The base \(RS\) is equal to \(PS = x\), and the height from \(R\) to \(TS\) is equal to \(QR\). Since \(QR\) is the same as \(PS\), it is also \(x\).
The area of triangle \(RST\) can be expressed as:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{3}{5}x \times x = \frac{3}{10}x^2.
\]
We know that this area is 7:
\[
\frac{3}{10}x^2 = 7.
\]

Step 5: Solve for \(x\).
\[
x^2 = \frac{70}{3} \implies x = \sqrt{\frac{70}{3}}.
\]

Step 6: Calculate the area of rectangle \(PQRS\).
The area of rectangle \(PQRS\) is \(PS \times QR = x \times x = x^2\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{70}{3}.
\]

Final Answer: $\boxed{\frac{70}{3}}$
