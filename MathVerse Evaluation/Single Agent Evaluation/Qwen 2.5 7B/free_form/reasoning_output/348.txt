QUESTION:
A helicopter is flying at an altitude of 198 metres, at an angle of depression of 44° to its landing pad. What is the distance d between the helicopter and the landing pad?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the distance \(d\) from the helicopter to the landing pad given the height of the helicopter (altitude) and the angle of depression. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the given information**:
   - Altitude of the helicopter (height \(h\)) = 198 meters.
   - Angle of depression (\(\theta\)) = 44°.

2. **Understand the geometry**:
   - The angle of depression is the angle formed between the line of sight from the helicopter to the landing pad and the horizontal plane.
   - The right triangle formed has:
     - One leg as the altitude (198 meters).
     - The other leg as the horizontal distance to the landing pad.
     - The hypotenuse as the distance \(d\) from the helicopter to the landing pad.

3. **Use trigonometry**:
   - The tangent function relates the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle.
   \[
   \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
   \]
   - Here, \(\theta = 44^\circ\), the opposite side is the altitude (198 meters), and the adjacent side is the horizontal distance to the landing pad.

4. **Set up the equation**:
   \[
   \tan(44^\circ) = \frac{198}{x}
   \]
   where \(x\) is the horizontal distance to the landing pad.

5. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x = \frac{198}{\tan(44^\circ)}
   \]

6. **Calculate the value**:
   Using a calculator,
   \[
   \tan(44^\circ) \approx 0.9657
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{198}{0.9657} \approx 204.98 \text{ meters}
   \]

7. **Find the hypotenuse \(d\)**:
   Using the Pythagorean theorem,
   \[
   d = \sqrt{x^2 + h^2}
   \]
   Substitute \(x \approx 204.98\) meters and \(h = 198\) meters:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(204.98)^2 + (198)^2}
   \]

8. **Calculate the value**:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{41996.9204 + 39204} \approx \sqrt{81100.9204} \approx 284.78 \text{ meters}
   \]

9. **Round to the nearest whole number**:
   \[
   d \approx 285 \text{ meters}
   \]

Final Answer: $285$
