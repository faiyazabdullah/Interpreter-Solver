QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the triangular prism shown. The height is 21 cm. The base is an isosceles triangle with waist length of 10 cm and base length of 12 cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the triangular prism, we need to calculate the lateral surface area and the area of the two triangular bases.

### Step 1: Calculate the Area of One Triangle
The base of the triangle is \(12\) cm, and the height from the opposite vertex to the base is \(8\) cm. The area of one triangle can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:

\[
\text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 8 = 48 \text{ cm}^2
\]

Since there are two such triangles forming the bases of the prism, the total area of the bases is:

\[
2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Perimeter of the Triangular Base
The base of the triangle is \(12\) cm, and the two equal sides (waists) are each \(10\) cm. Therefore, the perimeter of the base triangle is:

\[
12 + 10 + 10 = 32 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Lateral Surface Area
The lateral surface area is the perimeter of the triangular base multiplied by the height of the prism:

\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 32 \times 21 = 672 \text{ cm}^2
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Surface Area
The total surface area is the sum of the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface area:

\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 96 + 672 = 768 \text{ cm}^2
\]

Final Answer: $\boxed{768 \text{ cm}^2}$
