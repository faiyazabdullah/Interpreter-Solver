QUESTION:
A rectangle contains an ellipse. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). The center of the ellipse is (20,10), and its four vertices are (0,10), (20,10), (20,20), (40,10). A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given geometric figures and determine the coordinates of the center of the largest possible ellipse that can fit inside the rectangular box.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangular box**: 
   - The rectangular box has a length of \(40 \text{ cm}\) and a width of \(20 \text{ cm}\).

2. **Determine the position of the center of the ellipse**:
   - The center of the ellipse is given as \((20, 10)\).
   - The vertices of the rectangle are at \((0, 0)\), \((0, 20)\), \((40, 20)\), and \((40, 0)\).
   - Since the ellipse fits within the rectangle, the center of the ellipse should remain within the boundaries of the rectangle.

3. **Verify the position of the center**:
   - The center \((20, 10)\) is within the rectangle because both \(20\) (x-coordinate) and \(10\) (y-coordinate) fall within the range of the rectangle's boundaries (\(0 \leq x \leq 40\) and \(0 \leq y \leq 20\)).

Thus, the center of the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box remains the same as the center of the given ellipse.

Final Answer: $$(20, 10)$$
