QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5} \pi, 8\right)$ and again at $\left(\frac{7}{5} \pi, 8\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the period of the trigonometric function, we need to analyze the points where it intersects its midline. The midline is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the wave, and it's given as \( y = 8 \).

The two points where the function intersects the midline are:
\[ \left( \frac{3}{5} \pi, 8 \right) \]
\[ \left( \frac{7}{5} \pi, 8 \right) \]

The period \( T \) of a trigonometric function is the distance between two consecutive points where the function intersects its midline. Here, the distance between these two points is:
\[ \frac{7}{5} \pi - \frac{3}{5} \pi = \frac{4}{5} \pi \]

Since the period \( T \) is the distance between two consecutive points where the function intersects its midline, we have:
\[ T = \frac{4}{5} \pi \]

Final Answer: $T = \frac{4}{5} \pi$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $T = \frac{4}{5} \pi$
