QUESTION:
The radius of the figure is $ 13 \mathrm{~mm}$. It follows that a two thirds of a circle has area $\frac{2}{3} \pi r^{2}$. Find the exact area of the shape shown, which is two thirds of a circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the area of the shape, which is two-thirds of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the radius of the circle from the image: \( r = 13 \, \text{mm} \).
2. The formula for the area of a full circle is \( \pi r^2 \).
3. Since we need two-thirds of the circle, we calculate two-thirds of the area of the full circle: 
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2
   \]
4. Substitute \( r = 13 \, \text{mm} \) into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{2}{3} \pi (13)^2
   \]
5. Calculate \( 13^2 \):
   \[
   13^2 = 169
   \]
6. Substitute \( 169 \) into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{2}{3} \pi \cdot 169 = \frac{338}{3} \pi
   \]

Thus, the area of the shape is:
Final Answer: $\boxed{\frac{338}{3} \pi}$
