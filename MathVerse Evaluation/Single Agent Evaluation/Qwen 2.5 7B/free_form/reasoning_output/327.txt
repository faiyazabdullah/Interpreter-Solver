QUESTION:
During a rescue search, a helicopter flew b kilometres west from point X to point Y, then changed course and flew 10.7 kilometres north to point Z. If point Z is on a bearing of 335째 T from point X:

Now, if the distance that the helicopter must fly between point Z and point X is d kilometres, calculate d to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( d \), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem since the path from point \( X \) to point \( Z \) forms a right triangle with the legs being the distances \( b \) and 10.7 km, and the hypotenuse being \( d \).

Given:
- The helicopter flies \( b \) km west from \( X \) to \( Y \).
- Then it flies 10.7 km north to reach \( Z \).
- The bearing of \( Z \) from \( X \) is 335째.

Since the bearing 335째 corresponds to an angle of 35째 below the horizontal (or north), the right triangle formed has sides \( b \) and 10.7 km, with the hypotenuse \( d \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{b^2 + 10.7^2} \]

Without the specific value of \( b \), we can't compute the exact numerical value for \( d \). However, the formula for \( d \) in terms of \( b \) is:
\[ d = \sqrt{b^2 + 10.7^2} \]

Final Answer: $d = \sqrt{b^2 + 10.7^2}$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $d = \sqrt{b^2 + 10.7^2}$
