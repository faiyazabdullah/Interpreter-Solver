QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function going through (-3, -4), (-1, 0), (0, 2), and (1, 4). Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the intervals on which the piecewise function is increasing, decreasing, or constant, we need to analyze the slope of the line segments connecting the given points.

The points provided are: (-3, -4), (-1, 0), (0, 2), and (1, 4).

1. **Interval from (-3, -4) to (-1, 0):**
   The slope \( m_1 \) is calculated as follows:
   \[
   m_1 = \frac{0 - (-4)}{-1 - (-3)} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]
   Since the slope is positive, the function is increasing in this interval: \((-3, -1)\).

2. **Interval from (-1, 0) to (0, 2):**
   The slope \( m_2 \) is calculated as follows:
   \[
   m_2 = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-1)} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
   \]
   Again, since the slope is positive, the function is increasing in this interval: \((-1, 0)\).

3. **Interval from (0, 2) to (1, 4):**
   The slope \( m_3 \) is calculated as follows:
   \[
   m_3 = \frac{4 - 2}{1 - 0} = \frac{2}{1} = 2
   \]
   Since the slope is positive, the function is increasing in this interval: \((0, 1)\).

Since there is no horizontal segment in the graph, there is no constant interval.

Combining these intervals, we get:
- Increasing: \((-3, 1)\)

Final Answer: $(-3, 1)$
