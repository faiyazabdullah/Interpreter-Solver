QUESTION:
In the figure above, triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 37° and angle B is 48°. Find the true bearing of point A from point B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the true bearing of point A from point B, we need to determine the angle that line segment AB makes with the north direction. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Identify the angles at points A and B**:
   - At point A, the angle is \(37^\circ\) measured clockwise from the north.
   - At point B, the angle is \(48^\circ\) measured clockwise from the north.

2. **Determine the bearing of A from B**:
   - Since the bearing is the angle measured clockwise from the north, we subtract the angle at point A from the angle at point B if the point A is to the east of point B, otherwise, add the angle at point A to the angle at point B if point A is to the west of point B.
   
   Given the angles, point A is to the west of point B. Therefore, we add the angle at point A to the angle at point B to get the bearing of A from B.

3. **Calculate the bearing**:
   \[
   \text{Bearing of A from B} = 48^\circ + 37^\circ = 85^\circ
   \]

Final Answer: $85^\circ$
