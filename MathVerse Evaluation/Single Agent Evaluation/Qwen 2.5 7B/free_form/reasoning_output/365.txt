QUESTION:
The airtraffic controller is communicating with a plane in flight approaching an airport for landing. The plane is 10369 metres above the ground and is still 23444 metres from the runway. If \theta Â° is the angle at which the plane should approach, find \theta  to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the angle \(\theta\) that the plane should approach. This involves finding the tangent of the angle \(\theta\), which can be derived from the right triangle formed by the height of the plane above the ground, the horizontal distance from the plane to the runway, and the angle \(\theta\).

Given:
- Height of the plane above the ground (\(h\)) = 10369 meters
- Horizontal distance from the plane to the runway (\(d\)) = 23444 meters
- Angle \(\theta\) that we need to find

The tangent function in a right triangle is defined as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{h}{d}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{10369}{23444}
\]

Now, calculate the value of \(\tan \theta\):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{10369}{23444} \approx 0.4420
\]

To find \(\theta\), we take the arctangent (inverse tangent) of 0.4420:
\[
\theta = \arctan(0.4420)
\]

Using a calculator to find the angle in degrees:
\[
\theta \approx 23.8^\circ
\]

Thus, the angle \(\theta\) that the plane should approach is approximately \(23.8^\circ\).

Final Answer: $\boxed{23.8^\circ}$
