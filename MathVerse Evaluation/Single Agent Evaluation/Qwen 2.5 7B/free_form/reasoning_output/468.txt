QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.


Find the centre of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the center of the circle, we need to determine the coordinates of the point where the circle intersects the axes. Since the circle has four intersection points with the axes, two points lie on the x-axis and two on the y-axis.

From the graph, it appears that the circle intersects the x-axis at approximately \((0, 0)\) and \((8, 0)\), and the y-axis at approximately \((0, 4)\) and \((0, -4)\).

The center of the circle is the midpoint of the diameter formed by these intersection points. The x-coordinate of the center will be the average of the x-coordinates of the intersection points on the x-axis, and the y-coordinate will be the average of the y-coordinates of the intersection points on the y-axis.

The x-coordinates of the intersection points on the x-axis are \(0\) and \(8\). The average is:
\[
\frac{0 + 8}{2} = 4
\]

The y-coordinates of the intersection points on the y-axis are \(4\) and \(-4\). The average is:
\[
\frac{4 + (-4)}{2} = 0
\]

Thus, the center of the circle is \((4, 0)\).

Final Answer: $$(4, 0)$$
