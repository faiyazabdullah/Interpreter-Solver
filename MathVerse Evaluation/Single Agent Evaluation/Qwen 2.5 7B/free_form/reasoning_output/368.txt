QUESTION:
A farmer wants to build a fence around the entire perimeter of his land, as shown in the diagram. The fencing costs £37 per metre. the lengths of EF and CD are x metre and y metre.
At £37 per metre of fencing, how much will it cost him to build the fence along the entire perimeter of the land?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the total length of the fencing required and then calculate the cost based on the given rate.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Identify the dimensions and segments:**
   - AB = 5 m (vertical height from A to B)
   - BC = 3 m (horizontal width from B to C)
   - CD = 2 m (horizontal width from D to C)
   - EF = x m (vertical segment from E to F)
   - DF = y m (diagonal segment from D to F)

2. **Calculate the total perimeter:**
   - The perimeter consists of the following segments: AB + BC + CD + EF + DF.
   - Given AB = 5 m, BC = 3 m, and CD = 2 m.
   - Therefore, the total perimeter is \( P = 5 + 3 + 2 + x + y \).

3. **Calculate the cost of the fencing:**
   - The cost of fencing is £37 per meter.
   - The total cost \( C \) is given by the formula \( C = 37 \times P \).
   - Substituting the perimeter \( P \), we get \( C = 37 \times (5 + 3 + 2 + x + y) \).

### Final Expression:
The final expression for the cost of the fencing is:
\[ \text{Cost} = 37 \times (10 + x + y) \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{37(10 + x + y)}
\]
