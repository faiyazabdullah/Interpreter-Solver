QUESTION:
A figure with a radius of $ 5 \mathrm{~mm}$. Find the exact area of the given figure:

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the exact area of the given figure, which is a quarter circle with a radius of \(5 \text{ mm}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the shape**: The figure is a quarter circle because it is one-fourth of a full circle.
2. **Use the formula for the area of a full circle**: The area \(A\) of a full circle is given by \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius.
3. **Calculate the area of the full circle**: Substituting \(r = 5 \text{ mm}\), we get \(A = \pi (5)^2 = 25\pi \text{ mm}^2\).
4. **Find the area of the quarter circle**: Since the quarter circle is one-fourth of the full circle, the area of the quarter circle is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 25\pi = \frac{25\pi}{4} \text{ mm}^2\).

Thus, the exact area of the given figure is:

Final Answer: $\frac{25\pi}{4} \text{ mm}^2$
