QUESTION:
The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, let's analyze the given geometric figure:

1. The total area of the figure is given as \(6096\).
2. The figure can be divided into three rectangles along the vertical axis. The heights of these rectangles are \(6\), \(10\), and the unknown height of the third rectangle.
3. The widths of the first two rectangles are \(1000\) and \(10\) respectively.
4. Let the width of the third rectangle be \(w\).

We know the area of each rectangle:
- The area of the first rectangle is \(1000 \times 6 = 6000\).
- The area of the second rectangle is \(10 \times 10 = 100\).

Let the area of the third rectangle be \(A_3 = w \times h\), where \(h\) is the height of the third rectangle. We need to find the height \(h\) of the third rectangle.

The total area is the sum of the areas of the three rectangles:
\[ 6000 + 100 + A_3 = 6096 \]

Thus,
\[ A_3 = 6096 - 6000 - 100 = 86 \]

Since the width \(w\) of the third rectangle is not specified, we assume it is the same as the width of the other rectangles, which is \(10\) (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise). Therefore,
\[ A_3 = 10 \times h = 86 \]
\[ h = \frac{86}{10} = 8.6 \]

Now, we calculate the area of the third rectangle:
\[ A_3 = 10 \times 8.6 = 86 \]

The area of the third rectangle is \(86\). Therefore, the remaining area after removing the area of the third rectangle from the total area is:
\[ 6096 - 86 = 6010 \]

Final Answer: $\boxed{6010}$
