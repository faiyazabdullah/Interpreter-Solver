QUESTION:
A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions, splitted by a middle base. Length of middle base is 8, height of upper square pyramid is 2x+3, height of whole square pyramid is 6x+9.

Find an expression for the length L of the base of the pyramid in terms of the variable, x.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for the length \( L \) of the base of the pyramid in terms of \( x \), we need to understand the geometric relationship between the heights of the two pyramids and their bases.

Given:
- Height of the upper pyramid: \( 2x + 3 \)
- Height of the entire pyramid: \( 6x + 9 \)
- Length of the middle base: 8

Since the middle base splits the pyramid into two smaller similar pyramids, the ratio of the heights of these smaller pyramids will be equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

\[
\frac{\text{Height of upper pyramid}}{\text{Height of entire pyramid}} = \frac{\text{Middle base length}}{\text{Base length}}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{2x + 3}{6x + 9} = \frac{8}{L}
\]

Cross-multiplying to solve for \( L \):

\[
(2x + 3)L = 8(6x + 9)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
2xL + 3L = 48x + 72
\]

Rearranging to isolate \( L \):

\[
2xL + 3L = 48x + 72 \implies L(2x + 3) = 48x + 72
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 2x + 3 \):

\[
L = \frac{48x + 72}{2x + 3}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

\[
L = \frac{48x + 72}{2x + 3} = \frac{48x + 72}{2(x + 3)} = \frac{24x + 36}{x + 3} = 24
\]

Thus, the length \( L \) of the base of the pyramid in terms of \( x \) is:

Final Answer: $L = \frac{24x + 36}{x + 3}$
