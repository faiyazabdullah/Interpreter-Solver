QUESTION:
A suspension bridge is being built. The top of the concrete tower is 35.5 metres above the bridge and the connection point for the main cable is 65.9 metres from the tower.

Assume that the concrete tower and the bridge are perpendicular to each other.

If the length of the cable is h metres, find h to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the cable \( h \), which forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle. The height of the tower is one leg of the triangle, and the horizontal distance from the tower to the point where the cable connects to the bridge is the other leg.

Given:
- The height of the tower \( y = 35.5 \) meters.
- The horizontal distance from the tower to the connection point on the bridge \( x = 65.9 \) meters.
- We need to find the length of the cable \( h \).

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( h \):

\[ h = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ h = \sqrt{(65.9)^2 + (35.5)^2} \]

First, calculate the squares of \( x \) and \( y \):

\[ (65.9)^2 = 4342.81 \]
\[ (35.5)^2 = 1260.25 \]

Next, add these values together:

\[ 4342.81 + 1260.25 = 5603.06 \]

Now, take the square root of the sum:

\[ h = \sqrt{5603.06} \approx 74.85 \]

Rounding to two decimal places:

\[ h \approx 74.85 \]

Final Answer: $h \approx 74.85$
