QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of $y=\sin x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(90^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=5 \sin x$

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the coordinates of the first maximum point of the function \( y = 5 \sin x \), we need to understand how the transformation affects the sine function.

1. **Identify the maximum point of the standard sine function**: The standard sine function \( y = \sin x \) has its first maximum point at \( x = 90^\circ \).

2. **Analyze the transformation**: The function \( y = 5 \sin x \) is a vertical stretch of the standard sine function by a factor of 5. This means every y-coordinate of the sine function is multiplied by 5, but the x-coordinates remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the new maximum point**: Since the transformation only affects the amplitude and not the location of the maximum points, the x-coordinate of the first maximum point remains the same. Thus, the first maximum point of \( y = 5 \sin x \) is still at \( x = 90^\circ \).

4. **Calculate the y-coordinate**: The y-coordinate of the maximum point is obtained by evaluating the function at \( x = 90^\circ \):
   \[
   y = 5 \sin 90^\circ = 5 \times 1 = 5
   \]

Therefore, the coordinates of the first maximum point of \( y = 5 \sin x \) are \( (90^\circ, 5) \).

Final Answer: \( (90^\circ, 5) \)
