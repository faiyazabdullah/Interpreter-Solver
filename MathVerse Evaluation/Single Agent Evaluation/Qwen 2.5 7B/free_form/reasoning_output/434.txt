QUESTION:
Given the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at 9 and -9 and with y-axis at 3 and -3, determine its equation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the equation of the ellipse, we need to identify its standard form. The standard form of an ellipse centered at the origin is:

\[ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \]

where \(a\) is the distance from the center to each vertex along the major axis, and \(b\) is the distance from the center to each co-vertex along the minor axis.

From the graph, we can observe the following:
- The ellipse intersects the x-axis at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), indicating that the distance from the center to each vertex along the x-axis is \(9\). Therefore, \(a = 9\).
- The ellipse intersects the y-axis at \(y = 3\) and \(y = -3\), indicating that the distance from the center to each co-vertex along the y-axis is \(3\). Therefore, \(b = 3\).

Substituting these values into the standard form, we get:

\[ \frac{x^2}{9^2} + \frac{y^2}{3^2} = 1 \]
\[ \frac{x^2}{81} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1 \]

Thus, the equation of the ellipse is:

Final Answer: $\boxed{\frac{x^2}{81} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1}$
