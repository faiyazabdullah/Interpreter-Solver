QUESTION:
A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions. The height of the square pyramid is 5x+7. Length L is the side of the base of the pyramid.

Find an expression for L, in terms of the variable, x.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the expression for \( L \), the side length of the base of the square pyramid, we need to analyze the given information and apply the appropriate geometric principles.

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - Height of the pyramid: \( h = 5x + 7 \)
   - The height from the center of the base to the apex is split into two segments by a plane parallel to the base, one being \( 2x + 3 \).

2. **Understand the Geometry:**
   - The height of the pyramid can be divided into two segments: the height from the base to the midpoint of the pyramid (\( 2x + 3 \)) and the remaining part to the apex (\( 5x + 7 - (2x + 3) = 3x + 4 \)).
   - This forms a smaller similar triangle with the original pyramid.

3. **Similar Triangles Property:**
   - The triangles formed by the height and the sides of the pyramid are similar.
   - Let the side length of the base of the smaller triangle be \( L/2 \) (since the plane cuts it at the midpoint of each side).
   - By similarity of triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal:

     \[
     \frac{\text{Height of smaller triangle}}{\text{Height of original pyramid}} = \frac{\text{Side of smaller triangle}}{\text{Side of original triangle}}
     \]

     Substituting the known values:

     \[
     \frac{2x + 3}{5x + 7} = \frac{L/2}{5}
     \]

4. **Solve for \( L \):**

   \[
   \frac{2x + 3}{5x + 7} = \frac{L/2}{5}
   \]

   Cross-multiplying gives:

   \[
   5(2x + 3) = \frac{L}{2}(5x + 7)
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   10x + 15 = \frac{L}{2}(5x + 7)
   \]

   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:

   \[
   2(10x + 15) = L(5x + 7)
   \]

   \[
   20x + 30 = L(5x + 7)
   \]

   Distribute \( L \):

   \[
   20x + 30 = 5Lx + 7L
   \]

   Rearrange to solve for \( L \):

   \[
   20x + 30 - 7L = 5Lx
   \]

   \[
   20x + 30 = 5Lx + 7L
   \]

   Isolate \( L \):

   \[
   20x + 30 = L(5x + 7)
   \]

   \[
   L = \frac{20x + 30}{5x + 7}
   \]

Final Answer: $L = \frac{20x + 30}{5x + 7}$
