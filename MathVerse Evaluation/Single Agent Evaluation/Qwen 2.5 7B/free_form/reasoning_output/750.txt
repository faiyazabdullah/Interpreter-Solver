QUESTION:
Consider the following figure. The base is a triangle with two side of the same length 10cm and one side of length 12cm. The height of the prism is 16cm.

Use Pythagoras' Theorem to find the unknown height $x$ in the triangular prism shown.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for the unknown height \( x \) in the triangular prism, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem in the context of the right triangle formed within the prism. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Identify the components of the triangle**:
   - The base of the triangle is 12 cm.
   - Two sides of the triangle are each 10 cm.
   - The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from the vertex opposite the base to the midpoint of the base is part of the height of the prism, which is 16 cm.

2. **Determine the length of the base segment**:
   Since the triangle is isosceles, the perpendicular dropped from the vertex splits the base into two equal segments of 6 cm each.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**:
   In the right triangle, the legs are 6 cm and \( x \), and the hypotenuse is 10 cm.
   \[
   10^2 = 6^2 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 36 + x^2
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 100 - 36
   \]
   \[
   x^2 = 64
   \]
   \[
   x = \sqrt{64}
   \]
   \[
   x = 8
   \]

Thus, the unknown height \( x \) is 8 cm.

Final Answer: $x = 8$
