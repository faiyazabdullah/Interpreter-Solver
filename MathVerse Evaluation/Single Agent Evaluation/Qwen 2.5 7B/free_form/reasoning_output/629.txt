QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The x-axis represents Time (minutes) and the y-axis represents Water (liters). The slope is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Archimedes drained the water in his tub.
The amount of water left in the tub (in liters) as a function of time (in minutes) is graphed.
How much water was initially in the tub?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine how much water was initially in the tub, we need to analyze the linear function given in the graph.

1. The graph shows a straight line that starts at the point (0, 360) and ends at the point (5, 0).
2. The y-intercept of the line is 360, which means the initial amount of water in the tub is 360 liters.
3. Since the line is a straight line, it has a constant rate of change, which can be interpreted as the rate at which water is being drained from the tub. However, the question only asks for the initial amount of water in the tub, not the rate of drainage.

Therefore, the initial amount of water in the tub is simply the y-intercept of the line.

Final Answer: $360$
