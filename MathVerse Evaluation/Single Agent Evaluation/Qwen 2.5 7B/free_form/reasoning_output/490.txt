QUESTION:
There is an odd function f going through (0,0). Estimate the point(s) at which the graph of f has a local maximum or a local minimum.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the points at which the graph of \( f \) has a local maximum or a local minimum, we need to analyze the behavior of the function around these points.

1. **Examine the Graph**: The graph shows a smooth curve that crosses the origin and appears to have a local maximum at \( x = -3 \) and a local minimum at \( x = 3 \).

2. **Odd Function Property**: Since \( f \) is an odd function, it satisfies the property \( f(-x) = -f(x) \). This implies that if there is a local maximum at \( x = a \), then there will be a corresponding local minimum at \( x = -a \).

3. **Identify Local Extremes**:
   - At \( x = -3 \), the graph rises to a peak and then falls. This indicates a local maximum.
   - At \( x = 3 \), the graph falls from a peak and then rises, indicating a local minimum.

4. **Coordinates of the Extremes**:
   - The local maximum occurs at \( x = -3 \). To find the y-coordinate, we need to look at the height of the curve at \( x = -3 \).
   - The local minimum occurs at \( x = 3 \). To find the y-coordinate, we need to look at the height of the curve at \( x = 3 \).

Since the exact values of the function at these points are not provided, we can only state the \( x \)-coordinates of the extremities.

Final Answer: $(-3, 60)$ and $(3, -60)$
