QUESTION:
A vertical blue line in the graph. What is the equation of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the equation of the vertical blue line in the graph:

1. **Examine the Graph**: The graph shows a vertical line that runs parallel to the y-axis. Vertical lines have equations of the form \(x = c\), where \(c\) is a constant.

2. **Identify the Constant \(c\)**: From the graph, we can see that the vertical line passes through the point \(x = 0\). This means the value of \(c\) is 0.

3. **Formulate the Equation**: Since the line passes through \(x = 0\), the equation of the vertical line is \(x = 0\).

Final Answer: $x = 0$

====================================================================================================
EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $x = 0$
