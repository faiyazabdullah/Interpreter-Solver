QUESTION:
Consider the following diagram. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 38° and angle B is 49°.

Find the true bearing of point C from point B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( B \), we need to determine the angle between the north direction and the line segment \( BC \).

Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the angles at point \( B \):**
   - The angle at \( B \) is given as \( 49^\circ \).
   - Since \( A \) and \( B \) are connected by a straight line and the angle at \( A \) is \( 38^\circ \), the remaining angle at \( B \) can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \angle A \text{ (at point } A\text{)} = 38^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \angle B \text{ (at point } B\text{)} = 49^\circ
     \]

2. **Determine the internal angle at point \( C \):**
   - In triangle \( ABC \), the sum of the internal angles is \( 180^\circ \).
   - Therefore, the internal angle at point \( C \) can be calculated as:
     \[
     \angle C = 180^\circ - (\angle A + \angle B)
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \angle C = 180^\circ - (38^\circ + 49^\circ) = 180^\circ - 87^\circ = 93^\circ
     \]

3. **Calculate the bearing of point \( C \) from point \( B \):**
   - The bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.
   - Since point \( B \) is directly north, and point \( C \) forms an angle of \( 93^\circ \) with the north direction, the true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( B \) is:
     \[
     93^\circ
     \]

Thus, the true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( B \) is \( 93^\circ \).

Final Answer: $93^\circ$
