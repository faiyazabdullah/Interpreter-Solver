QUESTION:
There is a quadratic function that opens upwards symmetric with respect to x=2. The vertex of the parabola is at the point (2,-2). Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the intervals on which the quadratic function is increasing, decreasing, or constant, we need to analyze the behavior of the parabola based on its vertex and direction of opening.

1. **Identify the vertex and direction of opening**:
   - The vertex of the parabola is given as \((2, -2)\).
   - The parabola opens upwards, which means the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive.

2. **Determine the axis of symmetry**:
   - The axis of symmetry for a parabola given by \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\) is \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\).
   - Since the vertex is at \(x = 2\), the axis of symmetry is \(x = 2\).

3. **Analyze the intervals**:
   - The parabola increases to the right of the vertex and decreases to the left of the vertex.
   - Therefore, the function is decreasing on the interval \((-\infty, 2]\) and increasing on the interval \([2, \infty)\).

Final Answer: $(-\infty, 2] \text{ decreasing}, [2, \infty) \text{ increasing}$
