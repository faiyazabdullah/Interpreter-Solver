QUESTION:
Luke sailed for 116 kilometres on a bearing of 231^\circ .

If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, find $w$ to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( w \), we need to determine how far Luke has sailed west from his starting point. We can use trigonometry to find the distance \( w \).

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The total distance sailed is \( 116 \text{ km} \).
   - The bearing is \( 231^\circ \).

2. **Understand the bearing:**
   - A bearing of \( 231^\circ \) means the direction is \( 231^\circ \) counterclockwise from north. This can be broken down into its components in the coordinate system where north is the positive y-axis and east is the positive x-axis.

3. **Determine the angle with respect to the x-axis:**
   - Since the bearing is \( 231^\circ \), the angle with respect to the x-axis (east-west line) is:
     \[
     \theta = 231^\circ - 180^\circ = 51^\circ \quad (\text{counterclockwise from east})
     \]

4. **Use trigonometry to find the westward component:**
   - The westward component \( w \) can be found using the cosine function:
     \[
     w = 116 \cos(51^\circ)
     \]

5. **Calculate the value:**
   - Using a calculator to find the cosine of \( 51^\circ \):
     \[
     \cos(51^\circ) \approx 0.6293
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     w \approx 116 \times 0.6293 \approx 73.15
     \]

6. **Round to one decimal place:**
   \[
   w \approx 73.2
   \]

Final Answer: $73.2$
