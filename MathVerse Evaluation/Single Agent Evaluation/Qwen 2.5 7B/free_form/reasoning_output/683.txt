QUESTION:
This triangular prism shaped box labelled ABCDEF needs a diagonal support inserted as shown. Find the length AF of this support.
Hence, find the length of AF in terms of AB, BD and DF.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem, we need to analyze the structure of the triangular prism and determine the length of the diagonal support \(AF\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Geometry:**
   The given figure is a triangular prism \(ABCDEF\) where \(ABCD\) and \(EFGD\) are two congruent triangles forming the bases of the prism, and \(EF \parallel AB\), \(EF \parallel CD\), and \(EF = AB = CD\). The height of the prism is \(DF\).

2. **Understand the Diagonal Support:**
   The diagonal support \(AF\) runs from vertex \(A\) to vertex \(F\). Since \(EF \parallel AB\) and the prism is a right prism, \(AF\) forms a straight line segment within the prism.

3. **Use the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   In the context of a right prism, if we consider a cross-section along the height \(DF\), the diagonal \(AF\) can be treated as the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the base diagonal \(AD\) and the height \(DF\).

4. **Calculate the Length of \(AD\):**
   Since \(ABCD\) is a triangle and the prism is a right prism, the length \(AD\) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane \(ABCD\):
   \[
   AD = \sqrt{AB^2 + BD^2}
   \]

5. **Combine the Dimensions:**
   Now, the length of \(AF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with one leg being \(AD\) and the other leg being \(DF\):
   \[
   AF = \sqrt{(AD)^2 + (DF)^2}
   \]
   Substituting \(AD\):
   \[
   AF = \sqrt{(\sqrt{AB^2 + BD^2})^2 + DF^2}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root:
   \[
   AF = \sqrt{AB^2 + BD^2 + DF^2}
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{AB^2 + BD^2 + DF^2}}
\]
