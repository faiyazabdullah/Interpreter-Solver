QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $(1.25,-2.75)$ and it has a minimum point at $(4.75,-6.25)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.
$+\stackrel{x}{=}$ units

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the period of the trigonometric function from the graph, we need to identify two consecutive points where the function crosses its midline. The midline is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the function's oscillation, and the points where it intersects can help us find the period.

From the graph, we observe the following intersections:

- The first intersection with the midline is at \( (1.25, -2.75) \).
- The second intersection with the midline is at \( (4.75, -2.75) \).

The period \( T \) of a trigonometric function is the distance between two consecutive points where it crosses the midline. Here, the distance between these points is:

\[ T = 4.75 - 1.25 = 3.5 \]

Thus, the period of the function is \( 3.5 \) units.

Final Answer: $T = 3.5$
