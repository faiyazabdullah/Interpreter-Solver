QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\cos a$.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the value of \(\cos a\), we need to use the coordinates of point \(P\) and the definition of cosine in terms of the coordinates on the unit circle.

Given:
- Point \(P\) has coordinates \(\left( -\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29} \right)\).
- The radius of the circle (which is also the distance from the origin to point \(P\)) is 1.

The cosine of the angle \(a\) is defined as the x-coordinate of point \(P\) divided by the radius of the circle. Since the radius is 1, \(\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}\).

Therefore, the value of \(\cos a\) is:

Final Answer: $\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}$
