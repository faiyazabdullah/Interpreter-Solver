QUESTION:
There is a U-shape curve opens upwards and passes (0,0). Determine whether the graphed function is even, odd, or neither.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine if the graphed function is even, odd, or neither, we need to check the symmetry of the function about the y-axis and the origin.

1. **Check for Even Function**:
   A function \( f(x) \) is even if \( f(-x) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain of \( f \).

2. **Check for Odd Function**:
   A function \( f(x) \) is odd if \( f(-x) = -f(x) \) for all \( x \) in the domain of \( f \).

From the graph, observe that the curve is symmetric about the y-axis. This means that if you fold the graph along the y-axis, the left side will match the right side perfectly. Therefore, it suggests that the function is even.

To confirm, let's check the values of the function at specific points:
- At \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \).
- At \( x = 1 \), \( y = f(1) \).
- At \( x = -1 \), \( y = f(-1) \).

Since the curve is symmetric about the y-axis, \( f(-1) = f(1) \). This indicates that the function satisfies \( f(-x) = f(x) \), which is the definition of an even function.

Final Answer: $f(x)$ is an even function.
