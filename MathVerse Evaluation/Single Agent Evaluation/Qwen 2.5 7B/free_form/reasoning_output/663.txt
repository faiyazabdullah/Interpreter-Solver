QUESTION:
Write an equation for the surface area of the above cylinder if the length is $L$, the major radius $R$ and minor radius $r$. You must factorise this expression fully.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the cylinder, we need to consider both the lateral surface area and the area of the two circular bases. The formula for the surface area \(A\) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ A = 2\pi R^2 + 2\pi RL \]

where:
- \( R \) is the major radius,
- \( r \) is the minor radius,
- \( L \) is the length of the cylinder.

However, the problem does not specify whether \( r \) should be included in the calculation, so we'll assume that the minor radius \( r \) is not part of the formula since it's typically not considered in the surface area of a cylinder unless specified otherwise. Therefore, the formula simplifies to:

\[ A = 2\pi R^2 + 2\pi RL \]

This can be factored as follows:

\[ A = 2\pi R(R + L) \]

Final Answer: $2\pi R(R + L)$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $2\pi R(R + L)$
