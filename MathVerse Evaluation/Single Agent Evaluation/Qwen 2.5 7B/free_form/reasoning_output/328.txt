QUESTION:
Three television presenters are practising their navigation skills before heading off on an expedition to a remote location. Amelia at point B is positioned 17.6 metres south of Ned at point A. Bart at point C is due east of Amelia and on a bearing of S 38^\circ E from Ned. If Ned and Bart are d metres apart, find d to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information and the goal:**
   - Amelia is at point \( B \) and is 17.6 meters south of Ned at point \( A \).
   - Bart is at point \( C \) and is due east of Amelia.
   - Bart is on a bearing of S 38Â° E from Ned.
   - We need to find the distance \( d \) between Ned and Bart.

2. **Analyze the geometry:**
   - The line segment \( AB \) is vertical and has a length of 17.6 meters.
   - The angle \( \angle BAC = 38^\circ \).

3. **Use trigonometry to find \( d \):**
   - In triangle \( ABC \), we know that \( \angle BAC = 38^\circ \) and \( AB = 17.6 \) meters.
   - Since \( \angle BAC \) is the angle at \( A \), we can use the tangent function to find \( d \):
     \[
     \tan(38^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{d}{AB}
     \]
     Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \tan(38^\circ) = \frac{d}{17.6}
     \]

4. **Calculate \( d \):**
   - Using the value of \( \tan(38^\circ) \approx 0.7813 \):
     \[
     0.7813 = \frac{d}{17.6}
     \]
     Solving for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 17.6 \times 0.7813 \approx 13.62 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Round to one decimal place:**
   - \( d \approx 13.6 \text{ meters} \)

Final Answer: $d \approx 13.6$
