QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{2}{3} \pi, 1.2\right)$, and it has a minimum point at $\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi,-3.4\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the amplitude of the trigonometric function, we need to analyze the given points and the properties of the sine wave.

1. The midline of the sine wave is the horizontal line passing through the average value of the maximum and minimum values of the function. Given that the function intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{2}{3}\pi, 1.2\right)$, the y-coordinate of the midline is $1.2$. This means the midline is $y=1.2$.

2. The minimum value of the function is given as $\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4\right)$. Since the amplitude is half the distance between the maximum and minimum values, we can determine the amplitude by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values and then dividing by 2.

3. The amplitude is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{| \text{Maximum Value} - \text{Minimum Value} |}{2}
   \]
   To find the maximum value, we note that the sine wave oscillates symmetrically around the midline. Given the symmetry and the fact that the midline is $y=1.2$, the maximum value would be the y-coordinate of the peak, which is directly above the midline. However, since the function reaches $1.2$ at the midline and the minimum is $-3.4$, we can infer that the maximum value is not directly visible but can be derived from the amplitude calculation.

4. The maximum value can be inferred from the symmetry and the given minimum value. The distance from the midline to the minimum value is $1.2 - (-3.4) = 4.6$. Therefore, the maximum value would also be $1.2 + 4.6 = 5.8$.

5. Now, calculate the amplitude:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{|5.8 - (-3.4)|}{2} = \frac{9.2}{2} = 4.6
   \]

Therefore, the amplitude of the function is $\boxed{4.6}$. 

Final Answer: $4.6$
