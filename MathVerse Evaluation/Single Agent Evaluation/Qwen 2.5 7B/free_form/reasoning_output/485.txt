QUESTION:
There is a curve start from a solid point (1,0) with an end arrow going through (-4,4). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the domain and range of the function represented by the curve starting at the point (1,0) and ending at the point (-4,4), we need to analyze the x and y coordinates of these points.

1. **Domain**: The domain of the function is the set of all x-values that the curve covers. From the graph, the curve starts at \( x = 1 \) and ends at \( x = -4 \). Therefore, the domain is the interval from -4 to 1, inclusive.

2. **Range**: The range of the function is the set of all y-values that the curve covers. From the graph, the curve starts at \( y = 0 \) and ends at \( y = 4 \). Therefore, the range is the interval from 0 to 4, inclusive.

Now, let's write the domain and range in interval notation:

- Domain: \([-4, 1]\)
- Range: \([0, 4]\)

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } [-4, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 4]$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\text{Domain: } [-4, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [0, 4]$
