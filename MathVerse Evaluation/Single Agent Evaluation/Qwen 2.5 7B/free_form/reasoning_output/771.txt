QUESTION:
In the figure above, the circle with center O has radius 7, AB is a diameter, and AC = BC. What is the area of triangle ABC?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we start by analyzing the given geometric figure:

1. The circle has a radius of 7, making its diameter \( AB \) equal to \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \).
2. Since \( AB \) is a diameter, \( \angle ACB \) is a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)) because any angle subtended by a diameter in a semicircle is a right angle.
3. Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the circle, and \( C \) is such that \( AC = BC \). This implies that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles right triangle with \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \).

Given that \( AC = BC \), we can denote the length of each leg as \( x \). Therefore, \( AC = x \) and \( BC = x \).

Since \( AB \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( x \):

\[
AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
14^2 = x^2 + x^2
\]

\[
196 = 2x^2
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{196}{2}
\]

\[
x^2 = 98
\]

\[
x = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2}
\]

Now, we have the lengths of the legs of the right triangle \( \triangle ABC \) as \( 7\sqrt{2} \) each.

The area of a right triangle is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{leg}_1 \times \text{leg}_2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 7\sqrt{2} \times 7\sqrt{2}
\]

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 98
\]

\[
\text{Area} = 49
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is:

Final Answer: $\boxed{49}$
