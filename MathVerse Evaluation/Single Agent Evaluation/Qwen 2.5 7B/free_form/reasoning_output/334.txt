QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the positive direction of the x-axis is 28Â°.

Find the true bearing of A from O.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the true bearing of point \(A\) from point \(O\), we need to consider the angle given and how it relates to the standard reference directions.

1. The angle between line \(OA\) and the positive direction of the x-axis is \(28^\circ\).
2. In terms of bearings, we typically measure clockwise from the north direction.
3. Since the angle is measured counterclockwise from the east direction (which is \(0^\circ\) or \(180^\circ\) from north), we need to adjust this angle to get the bearing from north.

The true bearing can be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Bearing} = 90^\circ - 28^\circ = 62^\circ \]

This means the bearing of point \(A\) from point \(O\) is \(62^\circ\) clockwise from the north direction.

Final Answer: $62^\circ$
