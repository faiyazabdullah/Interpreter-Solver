QUESTION:
In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 30Â°, the marked right angled side has a length of x, and the diagonal side has a length of sqrt{10}. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the exact value of x.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \), we can use trigonometric ratios in the right-angled triangle. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The triangle is a right-angled triangle with one angle being \( 30^\circ \).
2. The hypotenuse is given as \( \sqrt{10} \).
3. We need to find the length of the side opposite the \( 30^\circ \) angle, which is \( x \).

In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore:
\[ \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{10}} \]

We know that \( \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1}{2} \). So we can write:
\[ \frac{1}{2} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{10}} \]

Now, solve for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{10} \]
\[ x = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, the exact value of \( x \) is:
\[ x = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Final Answer: $x = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}$
