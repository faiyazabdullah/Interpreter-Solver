QUESTION:
A square prism has sides of length 3cm, 3cm and 14cm as shown.

If the size of \angle DFH is \theta Â°, find theta to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The base of the prism is a square with side length 3 cm.
   - The height of the prism is 14 cm.
   - We need to find the angle \(\theta\) between the line segment \(DF\) and the base plane \(FGH\).

2. **Understand the geometric setup:**
   - \(D\) is one vertex of the prism.
   - \(F\) is the projection of \(D\) onto the base plane \(FGH\).
   - Since \(D\) projects vertically onto \(F\), \(DF\) is perpendicular to the base plane.
   - Therefore, the angle \(\theta\) we need to find is the angle between \(DF\) and the horizontal line \(FH\) in the right triangle \(DFH\).

3. **Identify the lengths:**
   - The vertical distance from \(D\) to \(F\) is the height of the prism, which is 14 cm.
   - The horizontal distance from \(F\) to \(H\) is the side length of the square base, which is 3 cm.

4. **Apply trigonometric relations:**
   - In the right triangle \(DFH\), \(\tan(\theta)\) is the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (base).
   - So, \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{14}{3}\).

5. **Calculate \(\theta\):**
   - Using the arctangent function, \(\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{14}{3}\right)\).

Now, let's calculate this value:

\[
\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{14}{3}\right)
\]

Using a calculator to find the value:

\[
\theta \approx 77.46^\circ
\]

Finally, rounding to two decimal places:

\[
\theta \approx 77.46^\circ
\]

Final Answer: \(\boxed{77.46^\circ}\)
