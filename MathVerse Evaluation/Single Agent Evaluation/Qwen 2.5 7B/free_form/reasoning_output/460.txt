QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.


Find the centre of the circle. Write your answer in the form ( _ , _ )

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the center of the circle, we need to determine the point that is equidistant from the two points where the circle intersects the axes.

1. Identify the intersection points of the circle with the axes.
   - The circle intersects the x-axis at \( (0, 0) \).
   - The circle intersects the y-axis at \( (0, 0) \).

2. Since both intersection points are the same, the center of the circle must lie on the line \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \). However, since the circle has a radius and does not touch the origin (it has a gap), the center must be slightly away from the origin along the line \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).

3. From the graph, it appears that the center is located at \( (0, -2) \).

Final Answer: $(-2, 0)$
