QUESTION:
All edges of the base of the following square pyramid are 8 cm long, while all the sloping edges are 12 cm long. The CN edge and DN edge have the equal length.
Find Y, the size of \angle PNM, correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for the angle \( \angle PNM \), we need to analyze the geometry of the pyramid and use trigonometric relationships.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Pyramid Geometry**:
   - The base of the pyramid is a square with side length 8 cm.
   - All slant heights (sloping edges) are 12 cm.
   - \( CN = DN \).

2. **Find the Midpoint of the Base**:
   - Let's denote the center of the base square as \( O \). Since the base is a square, the distance from \( O \) to any vertex is the same. The diagonal of the square is \( \sqrt{2} \times 8 = 8\sqrt{2} \).
   - The midpoint \( M \) of one of the sides of the square will be at half the distance of the diagonal, which is \( \frac{8\sqrt{2}}{2} = 4\sqrt{2} \).

3. **Calculate the Height of the Pyramid**:
   - Drop a perpendicular from the apex \( P \) to the center \( O \) of the base. This forms a right triangle \( POA \) where \( PO \) is the height of the pyramid, \( OA \) is the distance from the center to a vertex, and \( PA \) is the slant height.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle POA \):
     \[
     PA^2 = PO^2 + OA^2
     \]
     \[
     12^2 = h^2 + 4\sqrt{2}^2
     \]
     \[
     144 = h^2 + 32
     \]
     \[
     h^2 = 112
     \]
     \[
     h = \sqrt{112} = 4\sqrt{7}
     \]

4. **Determine \( \angle PNM \)**:
   - \( N \) and \( M \) are points on the edges \( CD \) and \( AD \) respectively.
   - Since \( CN = DN \), \( N \) is the midpoint of \( CD \).
   - \( NM \) is a segment within the plane of the base, and it forms a right triangle with \( PN \) and \( PM \) due to the symmetry and right angles formed by the perpendiculars from the apex to the base.
   - The angle \( \angle PNM \) can be determined by considering the right triangle \( \triangle PMN \).

5. **Calculate the Lengths**:
   - \( PM \) and \( PN \) are both hypotenuses of right triangles with one leg being the height of the pyramid \( h = 4\sqrt{7} \) and the other leg being half the diagonal of the base minus the height of the smaller triangles formed.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem again:
     \[
     PM = PN = \sqrt{(4\sqrt{2})^2 + (4\sqrt{7})^2} = \sqrt{32 + 112} = \sqrt{144} = 12
     \]

6. **Use Trigonometry**:
   - In \( \triangle PMN \), \( \angle PNM \) is the angle between the segments \( PM \) and \( PN \).
   - Since \( PM = PN = 12 \) and the base of the triangle is \( 4\sqrt{2} \), we can use the cosine rule:
     \[
     \cos(\angle PNM) = \frac{PM^2 + PN^2 - MN^2}{2 \cdot PM \cdot PN}
     \]
     - Calculate \( MN \): \( MN = \sqrt{(4\sqrt{2})^2 + (4\sqrt{7})^2} = 12 \)

    Therefore:
    \[
    \cos(\angle PNM) = \frac{12^2 + 12^2 - (4\sqrt{2})^2}{2 \cdot 12 \cdot 12} = \frac{144 + 144 - 32}{288} = \frac{256}{288} = \frac{16}{18} = \frac{8}{9}
    \]
    \[
    \angle PNM = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{8}{9}\right)
    \]

Finally, calculate the value of the angle:
\[
\angle PNM \approx \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{8}{9}\right) \approx 26.57^\circ
\]

Final Answer: $\boxed{26.57^\circ}$
