QUESTION:
From the cockpit of an aeroplane flying at an altitude of 3000 m, the angle of depression to the airport is 57°. The aeroplane continues to fly in the same straight line, and after a few minutes the angle of depression to the airport becomes 67°.
Now find the distance between the two sightings.

Round your answer to the nearest metre.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to use trigonometry to find the distances \(x\) and \(y\) and then calculate the difference between them.

### Step 1: Determine \(x\)
Given:
- The altitude of the airplane is \(3000\) meters.
- The angle of depression to the airport from the first position is \(57^\circ\).

We can use the tangent function to relate the angle to the sides of the right triangle formed by the airplane, the ground, and the vertical height.
\[
\tan(57^\circ) = \frac{3000}{x}
\]
\[
x = \frac{3000}{\tan(57^\circ)}
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
\tan(57^\circ) \approx 1.53986
\]
\[
x \approx \frac{3000}{1.53986} \approx 1949.85 \quad \text{(rounded to one decimal place)}
\]

### Step 2: Determine \(y\)
Given:
- The altitude of the airplane is \(3000\) meters.
- The angle of depression to the airport from the second position is \(67^\circ\).

Again, we use the tangent function:
\[
\tan(67^\circ) = \frac{3000}{y}
\]
\[
y = \frac{3000}{\tan(67^\circ)}
\]

Using a calculator:
\[
\tan(67^\circ) \approx 2.35589
\]
\[
y \approx \frac{3000}{2.35589} \approx 1277.66 \quad \text{(rounded to one decimal place)}
\]

### Step 3: Find the distance between the two sightings
The distance \(d\) between the two sightings is:
\[
d = x - y
\]
Substitute the values of \(x\) and \(y\):
\[
d = 1949.85 - 1277.66 \approx 672.19
\]

Rounding to the nearest meter:
\[
d \approx 672
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{672}
\]
