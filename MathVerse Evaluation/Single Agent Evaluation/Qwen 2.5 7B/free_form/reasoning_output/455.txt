QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the diameter.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the diameter of the circle, we need to determine the distance across the circle passing through its center. Given that the circle intersects the axes at four points, we can infer that these points are the endpoints of the diameter.

From the graph, the circle intersects the x-axis at points $(-4, 0)$ and $(4, 0)$, and it intersects the y-axis at points $(0, 4)$ and $(0, -4)$. The diameter is the line segment connecting any two opposite points on the circle that pass through the center. Since the circle intersects both axes, the diameter is the distance from $(-4, 0)$ to $(4, 0)$, which is simply twice the radius.

The radius of the circle can be calculated as half the length of the diameter. Since the circle passes through the point $(0, 4)$ and $(0, -4)$, the radius is the distance from the origin to either of these points, which is 4.

Therefore, the diameter is twice the radius:

\[
\text{Diameter} = 2 \times \text{radius} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

Final Answer: $8$
