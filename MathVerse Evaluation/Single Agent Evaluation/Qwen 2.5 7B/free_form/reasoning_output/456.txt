QUESTION:
Consider the circle on the graph. Its center at the origin and its radius is 7. State the equation of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of the circle, we need to use the standard form of the equation of a circle centered at the origin \((0,0)\). The general form is:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \]

where \(r\) is the radius of the circle. From the image, it is given that the radius \(r = 7\).

Substituting \(r = 7\) into the standard form:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = 7^2 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 49 \]

Therefore, the equation of the circle is:

Final Answer: \(x^2 + y^2 = 49\)

This completes our analysis and the required LaTeX formatting.
