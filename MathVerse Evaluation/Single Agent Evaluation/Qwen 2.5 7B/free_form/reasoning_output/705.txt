QUESTION:
Consider the following trapezoidal prism. The right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm. The trapezoid surface has edges of 3cm, 10cm and 13cm.  Find the surface area of the trapezoidal prism.

Give your answer to the nearest one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the trapezoidal prism, we need to calculate the area of each face and sum them up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Faces:**
   - Two rectangular faces with dimensions \(13 \text{ cm}\times 10 \text{ cm}\).
   - Two trapezoidal faces with bases \(10 \text{ cm}\) and \(3 \text{ cm}\), and height \(y \text{ cm}\).

2. **Calculate the Area of Rectangular Faces:**
   - Each rectangular face has an area of \(13 \text{ cm} \times 10 \text{ cm} = 130 \text{ cm}^2\).
   - There are two such faces, so their total area is \(2 \times 130 \text{ cm}^2 = 260 \text{ cm}^2\).

3. **Determine the Height \(y\) of the Trapezoidal Faces:**
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the slant height (\(y\)), the horizontal distance (3 cm), and the vertical distance (10 cm):
     \[
     y = \sqrt{10^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{100 + 9} = \sqrt{109}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Area of One Trapezoidal Face:**
   - The area of a trapezoid is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times (\text{sum of parallel sides}) \times \text{height}\).
   - Here, the parallel sides are \(10 \text{ cm}\) and \(3 \text{ cm}\), and the height is \(\sqrt{109} \text{ cm}\).
   - So, the area of one trapezoidal face is:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 + 3) \times \sqrt{109} = \frac{13\sqrt{109}}{2} \text{ cm}^2
     \]
   - Since there are two trapezoidal faces, their total area is:
     \[
     2 \times \frac{13\sqrt{109}}{2} = 13\sqrt{109} \text{ cm}^2
     \]

5. **Sum Up All the Areas:**
   - Total surface area is the sum of the areas of all faces:
     \[
     \text{Total Surface Area} = 260 \text{ cm}^2 + 13\sqrt{109} \text{ cm}^2
     \]

6. **Calculate the Numerical Value:**
   - Using \(\sqrt{109} \approx 10.44\):
     \[
     13\sqrt{109} \approx 13 \times 10.44 = 135.72 \text{ cm}^2
     \]
   - Thus, the total surface area is approximately:
     \[
     260 + 135.72 = 395.72 \text{ cm}^2
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{395.7}
\]
