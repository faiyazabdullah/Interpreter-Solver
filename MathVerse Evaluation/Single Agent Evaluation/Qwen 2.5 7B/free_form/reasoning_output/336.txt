QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the north direction is 31Â°.

Find the true bearing of point A from O.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the true bearing of point \(A\) from \(O\), we need to determine the angle formed between the north direction and the line \(OA\).

Given:
- The angle between line \(OA\) and the north direction is \(31^\circ\).
- The true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.

Since the angle is already given as \(31^\circ\), the true bearing of point \(A\) from \(O\) is simply:

Final Answer: $\boxed{31^\circ}$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\boxed{31^\circ}$
