QUESTION:
The diagram shows a water trough in the shape of a half cylinder. The height is 2.49 m and radius is 0.92 m.

Find the surface area of the outside of this water trough.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the outside of the water trough, which is in the shape of a half cylinder, we need to calculate the lateral surface area and then add the area of the base.

1. **Lateral Surface Area of the Half Cylinder:**
   The lateral surface area \(A_{\text{lateral}}\) of a full cylinder is given by:
   \[
   A_{\text{lateral}} = 2 \pi r h
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. Since the water trough is a half cylinder, the lateral surface area of the half cylinder will be:
   \[
   A_{\text{lateral}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \pi r h = \pi r h
   \]
   Substituting the given values \(r = 0.92 \, \text{m}\) and \(h = 2.49 \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   A_{\text{lateral}} = \pi \times 0.92 \times 2.49
   \]

2. **Area of the Base:**
   The base of the half cylinder is a semicircle. The area \(A_{\text{base}}\) of a semicircle is given by:
   \[
   A_{\text{base}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
   \]
   Substituting the given radius \(r = 0.92 \, \text{m}\):
   \[
   A_{\text{base}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \times (0.92)^2
   \]

3. **Total Surface Area:**
   The total surface area \(A_{\text{total}}\) is the sum of the lateral surface area and the area of the base:
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{lateral}} + A_{\text{base}}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \(A_{\text{lateral}}\) and \(A_{\text{base}}\):
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = \pi \times 0.92 \times 2.49 + \frac{1}{2} \pi \times (0.92)^2
   \]

Now, let's calculate the numerical values:
\[
\pi \times 0.92 \times 2.49 \approx 6.842 \, \text{m}^2
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} \pi \times (0.92)^2 \approx 1.254 \, \text{m}^2
\]
Adding these together:
\[
A_{\text{total}} \approx 6.842 + 1.254 = 8.106 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
A_{\text{total}} \approx 8.11 \, \text{m}^2
\]

Final Answer: $8.11 \text{m}^2$
