QUESTION:
There are two curves with a vertical asymptote x=3. One curve passes (1,0), and another curve passes (4,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing, we need to analyze the behavior of the curves around the vertical asymptote \( x = 3 \).

1. **Identify the points where the function crosses the x-axis**: The function crosses the x-axis at \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 4 \).
2. **Analyze the slopes around the vertical asymptote**:
   - To the left of \( x = 3 \), the function is decreasing because it starts from the positive side and goes down towards the vertical asymptote.
   - To the right of \( x = 3 \), the function is also decreasing but more pronounced due to the vertical asymptote.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that the function is decreasing on both sides of the vertical asymptote \( x = 3 \).

Final Answer: $f(x)$ is decreasing on \((-\infty, 3)\) and \((3, \infty)\).

Final Answer: $\boxed{\text{decreasing on } (-\infty, 3) \text{ and } (3, \infty)}$
