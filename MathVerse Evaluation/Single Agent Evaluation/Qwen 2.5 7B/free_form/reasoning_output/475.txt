QUESTION:
There is a point at 4 and a blue arrow goes to left from that point. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation, we need to analyze the given figure:

1. The number line starts at 0 and extends infinitely in both directions.
2. There is a point marked at 4.
3. A blue arrow points to the left from this point, indicating negative values.

Since the blue arrow points to the left from the point 4, it includes all numbers less than 4. Therefore, the set of numbers represented on the number line is all real numbers less than 4.

In interval notation, this is written as:
\[ (-\infty, 4) \]

Final Answer: $(-\infty, 4)$
