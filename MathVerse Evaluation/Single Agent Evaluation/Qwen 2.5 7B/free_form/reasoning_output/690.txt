QUESTION:
Consider the halfpipe with a diameter of 8 cm.

Find its volume, rounding to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the volume of the halfpipe, we need to recognize that it is essentially a half-cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \(V = \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height.

Given:
- The diameter of the halfpipe is 8 cm, so the radius \(r = \frac{8}{2} = 4\) cm.
- The length of the halfpipe along the curved surface is 20 cm, which is the height \(h\) of the cylinder.

First, calculate the volume of the full cylinder:
\[ V_{\text{full}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4)^2 (20) = 160\pi \]

Since the halfpipe is only half of this cylinder, the volume of the halfpipe is:
\[ V_{\text{halfpipe}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 160\pi = 80\pi \]

Now, we need to round this value to two decimal places:
\[ 80\pi \approx 80 \times 3.14159 = 251.3274 \]

So, the volume of the halfpipe, rounded to two decimal places, is:
\[ V_{\text{halfpipe}} \approx 251.33 \]

Final Answer: $251.33$
