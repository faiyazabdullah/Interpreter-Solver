QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function combind by straight lines going through (3, -2), (1, 0), and (0,1). Write an equation for the graphed function f.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of the piecewise function \( f \) given the points \((3, -2)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((0, 1)\), we need to determine the equations for each linear segment of the function.

### Step 1: Determine the slope of each line segment.
The general form of a line is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

#### Segment from \((3, -2)\) to \((1, 0)\):
The slope \( m_1 \) is calculated as follows:
\[
m_1 = \frac{0 - (-2)}{1 - 3} = \frac{2}{-2} = -1
\]

Using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with the point \((1, 0)\):
\[
y - 0 = -1(x - 1) \implies y = -x + 1
\]

#### Segment from \((1, 0)\) to \((0, 1)\):
The slope \( m_2 \) is calculated as follows:
\[
m_2 = \frac{1 - 0}{0 - 1} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1
\]

Using the point-slope form \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) with the point \((0, 1)\):
\[
y - 1 = -1(x - 0) \implies y = -x + 1
\]

### Step 2: Combine the equations into a piecewise function.
Since both segments have the same equation \( y = -x + 1 \), the piecewise function can be simplified to:
\[
f(x) = \begin{cases}
-x + 1 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 3 \\
-x + 1 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 3
\end{cases}
\]

However, since the function is continuous at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), the piecewise function simplifies to:
\[
f(x) = -x + 1 \quad \text{for} \quad 0 \leq x \leq 3
\]

Thus, the equation for the graphed function \( f \) is:
\[
\boxed{f(x) = -x + 1}
\]
