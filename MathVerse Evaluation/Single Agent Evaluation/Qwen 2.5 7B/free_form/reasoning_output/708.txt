QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the figure shown. The two marked edges have the same length. The top rectangular prism has sides length of 12cm, 1cm and 1cm. The bottom rectangular prism has sides length of 7cm, 4cm and 1cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the given figure, we need to consider the surface areas of both the top and bottom rectangular prisms and then sum them up, taking into account that the two marked edges have the same length.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the dimensions and surfaces of the top rectangular prism:**
   - Length: \(12 \, \text{cm}\)
   - Width: \(1 \, \text{cm}\)
   - Height: \(1 \, \text{cm}\)

   The surface area \(A_{\text{top}}\) of the top prism is calculated as follows:
   \[
   A_{\text{top}} = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(12 \cdot 1 + 12 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 1) = 2(12 + 12 + 1) = 50 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

2. **Identify the dimensions and surfaces of the bottom rectangular prism:**
   - Length: \(7 \, \text{cm}\)
   - Width: \(4 \, \text{cm}\)
   - Height: \(1 \, \text{cm}\)

   The surface area \(A_{\text{bottom}}\) of the bottom prism is calculated as follows:
   \[
   A_{\text{bottom}} = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(7 \cdot 4 + 7 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 1) = 2(28 + 7 + 4) = 70 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

3. **Sum the surface areas of the top and bottom prisms:**
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{top}} + A_{\text{bottom}} = 50 + 70 = 120 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

Final Answer: $120 \, \text{cm}^2$
