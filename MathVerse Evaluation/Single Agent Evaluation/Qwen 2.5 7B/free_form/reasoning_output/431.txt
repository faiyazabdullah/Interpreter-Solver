QUESTION:
Iainâ€™s car has run out of petrol. He walks 12 km west and then 9 km south looking for a petrol station.

If he is now $h$ km directly from his starting point, find the value of $h$.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Shape**: The geometric shape formed by Iain's walk is a right triangle with legs measuring 12 km (westward) and 9 km (southward).

2. **Identify the Hypotenuse**: We need to find the hypotenuse \( h \) which is the direct distance from the starting point to the ending point.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem**:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{(12 \text{ km})^2 + (9 \text{ km})^2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Squares**:
   \[
   (12 \text{ km})^2 = 144 \text{ km}^2
   \]
   \[
   (9 \text{ km})^2 = 81 \text{ km}^2
   \]

5. **Sum the Squares**:
   \[
   144 \text{ km}^2 + 81 \text{ km}^2 = 225 \text{ km}^2
   \]

6. **Find the Square Root**:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{225 \text{ km}^2} = 15 \text{ km}
   \]

Thus, the distance \( h \) from the starting point to the ending point is \( 15 \text{ km} \).

Final Answer: $15$
