QUESTION:
There are two quadratic functions. The red one is g(x) that goes through the origin and point (2, -4). Find the equation of the dashed line in red. Use exact numbers.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of the dashed line \( g(x) \) passing through the origin \((0,0)\) and the point \((2, -4)\), we need to determine its slope and then write the equation in slope-intercept form \( y = mx \).

1. **Calculate the slope \( m \):**
   The slope \( m \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Here, \((x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (2, -4)\).
   \[
   m = \frac{-4 - 0}{2 - 0} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
   \]

2. **Write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form \( y = mx \):**
   Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept \( b \) is 0.
   \[
   y = -2x
   \]

Final Answer: $y = -2x$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $y = -2x$
