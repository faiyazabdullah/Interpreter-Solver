QUESTION:
The following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0).

State the radius of the semicircle.

Radius = _ units

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the radius of the semicircle, we need to determine the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle's circumference. We can use the points provided to find the center and then calculate the radius.

1. The given points on the semicircle are: (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), and (7,0). 
2. Since the semicircle is symmetric about the y-axis, the center of the circle lies on the y-axis at some point \( (0, k) \).
3. The radius of the circle is the distance from the center \( (0, k) \) to any of the points on the semicircle.

Let's use the point (0, 7) as it is directly on the y-axis and easy to work with:
\[ \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (7 - k)^2} = |7 - k| \]
Since the center is on the y-axis, let's assume \( k = 7 \) because the maximum y-coordinate of the points on the semicircle is 7.

Now, we need to check if the other points lie on this circle:
\[ \text{Distance from } (0, 7) \text{ to } (-7, 0) \]
\[ \sqrt{(0 - (-7))^2 + (7 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{49 + 49} = \sqrt{98} = 7\sqrt{2} \]

Since the distances are consistent, the radius is \( 7\sqrt{2} \).

Final Answer: $7\sqrt{2}$
