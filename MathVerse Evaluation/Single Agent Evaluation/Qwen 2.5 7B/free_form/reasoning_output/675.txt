QUESTION:
Let us find the surface area of the solid given (constructed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder). The radius is 15 cm. The height of cylinder is 22 cm.

Hence, find the total surface area of the shape.

Give our answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the solid constructed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder, we need to calculate the surface area of the cylinder excluding its bottom base (since the hemisphere replaces it), and then add the surface area of the hemisphere.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Surface Area of the Cylinder (excluding the bottom base):**
   - The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is \(A_{\text{lateral}} = 2\pi rh\).
   - Here, \(r = 15 \text{ cm}\) and \(h = 22 \text{ cm}\).
   - Therefore, the lateral surface area is:
     \[
     A_{\text{lateral}} = 2\pi \times 15 \times 22 = 660\pi \text{ cm}^2
     \]

2. **Surface Area of the Hemisphere (excluding the base):**
   - The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is \(A_{\text{hemisphere}} = 2\pi r^2\).
   - Here, \(r = 15 \text{ cm}\).
   - Therefore, the curved surface area is:
     \[
     A_{\text{hemisphere}} = 2\pi \times 15^2 = 2\pi \times 225 = 450\pi \text{ cm}^2
     \]

3. **Total Surface Area:**
   - The total surface area is the sum of the lateral surface area of the cylinder and the curved surface area of the hemisphere.
   - Therefore, the total surface area is:
     \[
     A_{\text{total}} = 660\pi + 450\pi = 1110\pi \text{ cm}^2
     \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 1110\pi \text{ cm}^2
\]

Final Answer: $\boxed{1110\pi \text{ cm}^2}$
