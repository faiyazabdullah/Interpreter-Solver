QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the south direction is 32°.

What is the true bearing of A from O?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the true bearing of point A from point O, we need to understand that the true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction. Given that the angle between line OA and the south direction is 32°, we can calculate the true bearing as follows:

1. The angle between north and east is 90°.
2. The angle between north and west is also 90°.
3. The angle between south and west is 90°.
4. The angle between south and east is 90°.

Since the angle between OA and the south direction is 32°, the angle between OA and the west direction would be 90° - 32° = 58°.

Thus, the true bearing of A from O is 320° (58° west of south).

Final Answer: $320^\circ$
