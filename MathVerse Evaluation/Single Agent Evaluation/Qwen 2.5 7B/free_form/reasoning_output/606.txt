QUESTION:
The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the average rate of change of the call cost with respect to the call duration, we need to calculate the slope of the line connecting the two given points on the graph.

The two points on the graph are:
- Point 1: \((10, 10)\)
- Point 2: \((20, 19)\)

The formula for the slope \( m \) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:

\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Substituting the coordinates of the points:

\[ m = \frac{19 - 10}{20 - 10} \]

Calculate the numerator and the denominator:

\[ m = \frac{9}{10} \]

So, the average rate of change of the call cost with respect to the call duration is:

Final Answer: $m = \frac{9}{10}$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $m = \frac{9}{10}$
