QUESTION:
Calculate the volume of the half cylinder correct to one decimal place. The height is 9 cm and diameter is 6 cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To calculate the volume of a half cylinder, we use the formula for the volume of a full cylinder and then take half of it since the figure is a half cylinder:

\[ \text{Volume of a full cylinder} = \pi r^2 h \]

Where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. Here, the diameter is 6 cm, so the radius \( r \) is half of that, which is 3 cm. The height \( h \) is given as 9 cm.

First, calculate the volume of the full cylinder:

\[ \text{Volume of the full cylinder} = \pi (3)^2 (9) = 81\pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

Since the figure is a half cylinder, we take half of this volume:

\[ \text{Volume of the half cylinder} = \frac{81\pi}{2} = 40.5\pi \text{ cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to round this to one decimal place:

\[ 40.5\pi \approx 127.2 \text{ cm}^3 \]

Final Answer: $127.2$
