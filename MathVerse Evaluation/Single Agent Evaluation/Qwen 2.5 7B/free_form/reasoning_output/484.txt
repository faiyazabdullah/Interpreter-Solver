QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2). The point at (-5,2) and (3,2) are respectively solid and hollow. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the domain and range of the function, let's analyze the given points and the curve:

1. The curve passes through the points \((-5, 2)\), \((-1, 0)\), and \((3, 2)\).
2. The point at \((-5, 2)\) is solid, which means it belongs to the function.
3. The point at \((3, 2)\) is hollow, which means it does not belong to the function.
4. The curve appears to be a continuous parabola that opens upwards.

From the graph, we can deduce the following:
- The domain of the function includes all \(x\)-values from \(-5\) to \(3\), inclusive. This is because the curve extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 3\).
- The range of the function includes all \(y\)-values from the minimum value of the curve to the maximum value of the curve. From the graph, the minimum value of \(y\) appears to be just below 0, and the maximum value of \(y\) is 2. Since the curve is continuous and symmetric around its vertex, the minimum value of \(y\) is approximately 0.

Therefore, the domain and range in interval notation are:
- Domain: \([-5, 3]\)
- Range: \([-0.1, 2]\)

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } [-5, 3], \quad \text{Range: } [-0.1, 2]$
