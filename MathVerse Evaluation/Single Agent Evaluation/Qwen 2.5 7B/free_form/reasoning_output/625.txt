QUESTION:
A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible ellipse that fits within the rectangular box defined by the vertices (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0).

### Steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle**: The rectangle has a length of 40 cm and a width of 20 cm.
2. **Understand the ellipse's constraints**: The ellipse will have its major axis aligned with the longer side of the rectangle (the length, which is 40 cm).
3. **Determine the center of the ellipse**: The center of the ellipse will be at the midpoint of both the length and the width of the rectangle. Therefore, the center will be at (20, 10).

### Calculation:

- The x-coordinate of the center is the midpoint of the length, which is \( \frac{0 + 40}{2} = 20 \).
- The y-coordinate of the center is the midpoint of the width, which is \( \frac{0 + 20}{2} = 10 \).

Thus, the coordinates of the center of the ellipse are (20, 10).

Final Answer: $$(20, 10)$$
