QUESTION:
Find the surface area of this prism. The prism consists of 10 different rectangles with edges. The thickness of the prism is 3cm.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of the given prism, we need to calculate the area of each of its faces and then sum them up. The prism has two main rectangular bases and four lateral faces.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the dimensions:**
   - The base of the prism is a rectangle with dimensions \(17 \text{ cm}\) and \(8 \text{ cm}\).
   - The height of the prism is \(3 \text{ cm}\).
   - The additional height of the smaller prism attached at the top-right corner is \(4 \text{ cm}\).

2. **Calculate the area of the base:**
   \[
   \text{Base Area} = 17 \times 8 = 136 \text{ cm}^2
   \]
   Since there are two bases:
   \[
   \text{Total Base Area} = 2 \times 136 = 272 \text{ cm}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the lateral faces:**
   - The front face has dimensions \(17 \text{ cm} \times 3 \text{ cm}\):
     \[
     \text{Front Area} = 17 \times 3 = 51 \text{ cm}^2
     \]
   - The back face has dimensions \(17 \text{ cm} \times 3 \text{ cm}\):
     \[
     \text{Back Area} = 17 \times 3 = 51 \text{ cm}^2
     \]
   - The right face has dimensions \(8 \text{ cm} \times 3 \text{ cm}\):
     \[
     \text{Right Area} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ cm}^2
     \]
   - The left face has dimensions \(8 \text{ cm} \times 3 \text{ cm}\):
     \[
     \text{Left Area} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ cm}^2
     \]

4. **Calculate the area of the top face:**
   - The top face is a rectangle with dimensions \(17 \text{ cm} \times 4 \text{ cm}\):
     \[
     \text{Top Area} = 17 \times 4 = 68 \text{ cm}^2
     \]

5. **Sum the areas of all faces:**
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} = 272 + 51 + 51 + 24 + 24 + 68
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Surface Area} = 492 \text{ cm}^2
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{492 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
