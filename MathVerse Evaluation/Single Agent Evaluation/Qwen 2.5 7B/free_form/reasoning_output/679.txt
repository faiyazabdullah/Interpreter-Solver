QUESTION:
All edges of the following cube are 7 cm long.Find z, the size of \angle AGH, correct to 2 decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the size of \(\angle AGH\) in the given cube, we need to analyze the geometry of the cube and the angles formed within it.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Cube Structure**:
   - The cube has all edges equal to \(7\) cm.
   - The vertices are labeled as \(A, B, C, D, E, F, G,\) and \(H\).

2. **Understand the Angle \(\angle AGH\)**:
   - \(\angle AGH\) is part of the plane formed by points \(A, G,\) and \(H\).
   - In a cube, the angle between any two skew lines that intersect at a vertex can be analyzed using the properties of the cube's structure.

3. **Use Geometric Properties**:
   - Since \(A, G,\) and \(H\) are vertices of the cube, and \(G\) and \(H\) lie on the bottom face opposite to \(A\), the angle \(\angle AGH\) is essentially the angle between two faces of the cube.

4. **Calculate the Angle**:
   - The angle between two faces of a cube that meet at a vertex is \(90^\circ\). This is because each face of the cube is a square, and the angle between the diagonals of two adjacent squares is \(90^\circ\).

Thus, the size of \(\angle AGH\) is \(90^\circ\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{90^\circ}
\]
