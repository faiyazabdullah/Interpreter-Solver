QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the average rate of change of the number of earthquakes over the given time period:

1. Identify the number of earthquakes at each year:
   - Year 1: 6 earthquakes
   - Year 2: 6 earthquakes
   - Year 3: 6 earthquakes
   - Year 4: 6 earthquakes

2. Calculate the total change in the number of earthquakes:
   - Change in the number of earthquakes = Final value - Initial value
   - Change in the number of earthquakes = 6 - 6 = 0

3. Determine the total change in time:
   - Total time change = Final year - Initial year
   - Total time change = 4 - 1 = 3 years

4. Compute the average rate of change:
   - Average rate of change = $\frac{\text{Change in number of earthquakes}}{\text{Total change in time}}$
   - Average rate of change = $\frac{0}{3}$

5. Simplify the result:
   - Average rate of change = $0$

Final Answer: $0$
