QUESTION:
A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm. We wish to find the surface area of the entire solid. Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object.
What is the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism? Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

To solve the problem, let's break down the steps required:

1. **Identify the surface area components**:
   - The total surface area of the rectangular prism includes the areas of its six faces.
   - However, since the cylinder is attached to one face of the rectangular prism, we need to subtract the area of the base of the cylinder that is covered by the prism and add the area of the top face of the cylinder.

2. **Calculate the surface area of the rectangular prism**:
   - The surface area \( A_{\text{prism}} \) of a rectangular prism is given by:
     \[
     A_{\text{prism}} = 2(lw + lh + wh)
     \]
     where \( l = 21 \, \text{mm} \), \( w = 10 \, \text{mm} \), and \( h = 65 \, \text{mm} \).

3. **Calculate the surface area of the cylinder**:
   - The surface area \( A_{\text{cylinder}} \) of a cylinder (excluding the top and bottom) is given by:
     \[
     A_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi rh
     \]
     where \( r = 5 \, \text{mm} \) and \( h = 11 \, \text{mm} \).

4. **Calculate the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism**:
   - The exposed surface area is the total surface area of the prism minus the area of the base of the cylinder (since it is covered by the prism) plus the top face of the cylinder.

Let's compute these values:

1. **Surface area of the rectangular prism**:
   \[
   A_{\text{prism}} = 2(21 \times 10 + 21 \times 65 + 10 \times 65) = 2(210 + 1365 + 650) = 2 \times 2225 = 4450 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

2. **Surface area of the cylinder**:
   \[
   A_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi \times 5 \times 11 = 110\pi \, \text{mm}^2
   \]
   Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
   \[
   A_{\text{cylinder}} \approx 110 \times 3.14159 = 345.57 \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

3. **Exposed surface area calculation**:
   - Subtract the area of the base of the cylinder from the prismâ€™s surface area:
     \[
     A_{\text{base\_covered}} = 21 \times 10 = 210 \, \text{mm}^2
     \]
   - Add the top face of the cylinder:
     \[
     A_{\text{top\_face}} = 21 \times 10 = 210 \, \text{mm}^2
     \]
   - Therefore, the exposed surface area is:
     \[
     A_{\text{exposed}} = 4450 - 210 + 210 = 4450 \, \text{mm}^2
     \]

The final answer is:

Final Answer: $4450 \text{ mm}^2$
