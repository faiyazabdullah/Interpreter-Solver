QUESTION:
The graphs of logarithm function $f(x)=\ln x$ passing (1,4) and logarithm function $g(x)$ passing (1,0) are shown below. $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$.

Hence state the equation of $g(x)$.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of \( g(x) \), we need to determine how the graph of \( g(x) \) is related to the graph of \( f(x) = \ln x \). 

1. **Identify the Transformation**:
   - The point \((1, 0)\) on the graph of \( g(x) \) corresponds to the point \((1, 4)\) on the graph of \( f(x) = \ln x \).
   - This suggests that \( g(x) \) is a vertical translation of \( f(x) \).

2. **Determine the Translation**:
   - The y-coordinate of the point \((1, 0)\) on \( g(x) \) is 0, while the y-coordinate of the corresponding point \((1, 4)\) on \( f(x) = \ln x \) is 4.
   - Therefore, the translation is downward by \( 4 \) units.

3. **Write the Equation of \( g(x) \)**:
   - The general form of a vertical translation of a function \( f(x) \) by \( k \) units is \( f(x) + k \).
   - Here, \( f(x) = \ln x \) and \( k = -4 \) (since it's a downward shift).

Thus, the equation of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ g(x) = \ln x - 4 \]

Final Answer: \( g(x) = \ln x - 4 \)
