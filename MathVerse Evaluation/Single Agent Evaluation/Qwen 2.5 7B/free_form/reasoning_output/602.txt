QUESTION:
A piecewise function, with 2 segments constructed by a line passing (-5,1), (-3,2), and (-1,4) and a line passing (-1,5), (3,3), and (5,1), as shown in the figure. Let $f$ be the function given by the following graph. What is the domain of $f$?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the domain of the piecewise function \( f \) described by the given graph:

1. **Identify the segments of the function**:
   - The first segment starts at \((-5, 1)\) and ends at \((-1, 4)\).
   - The second segment starts at \((-1, 4)\) and ends at \((5, 1)\).

2. **Determine the domain for each segment**:
   - For the first segment, the domain is from \(-5\) to \(-1\), inclusive. This can be written as \([-5, -1]\).
   - For the second segment, the domain is from \(-1\) to \(5\), inclusive. This can be written as \([-1, 5]\).

3. **Combine the domains**:
   - Since these two intervals overlap at \(-1\), we combine them into one continuous interval that covers the entire range of \( x \)-values for which the function \( f \) is defined. Thus, the domain of \( f \) is \([-5, 5]\).

Final Answer: \([-5, 5]\)

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\([-5, 5]\)$
