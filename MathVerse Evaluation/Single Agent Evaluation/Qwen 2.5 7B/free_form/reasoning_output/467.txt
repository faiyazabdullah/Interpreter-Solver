QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, below.

State the equation of the circle shown in the graph.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of the circle, we need to determine its center and radius. The circle intersects the y-axis at two points, which suggests that the center of the circle lies on the x-axis. The radius is the distance from the center to any point on the circle.

From the graph, we can see that the circle intersects the y-axis at the points (0, 3) and (0, -3). This means the center of the circle is at the midpoint of these points, which is (0, 0).

Next, we calculate the radius. The radius is the distance from the center (0, 0) to either of the intersection points on the y-axis. Using the point (0, 3):

\[ r = \sqrt{(0-0)^2 + (3-0)^2} = \sqrt{0 + 9} = 3 \]

Thus, the equation of the circle is:

\[ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 = 3^2 = 9 \]

Final Answer: $x^2 + y^2 = 9$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $x^2 + y^2 = 9$
