QUESTION:
There is a hyperbolic function with its center at the origin. The graph approaches zero as $∣x∣$ increases, and the function is undefined at x=0. There are four points labeled at (1/6,6), (6,1/6), (-1/6,-6), (-6,-1/6). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the domain and range of the given hyperbolic function, let's analyze the provided points and the behavior of the function:

1. **Identify the Points and Behavior:**
   - The points given are: \((\frac{1}{6}, 6)\), \((6, \frac{1}{6})\), \((- \frac{1}{6}, -6)\), and \((-6, -\frac{1}{6})\).
   - These points suggest that the function has asymptotes along the y-axis and x-axis, indicating a hyperbola.

2. **Determine the Domain:**
   - The function is undefined at \(x = 0\) because it approaches infinity as \(x\) approaches 0 from either side.
   - The function extends to positive and negative infinity as \(x\) moves away from 0 in both directions.
   - Therefore, the domain of the function is all real numbers except 0.
   - In interval notation, the domain is \((- \infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)\).

3. **Determine the Range:**
   - As \(x\) approaches infinity or negative infinity, \(y\) approaches 0 but never actually reaches 0.
   - As \(x\) approaches 0 from either side, \(y\) approaches positive or negative infinity.
   - Therefore, the range of the function is all real numbers except 0.
   - In interval notation, the range is \((- \infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)\).

Final Answer: 
\[
\text{Domain: } (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty), \quad \text{Range: } (-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)
\]
