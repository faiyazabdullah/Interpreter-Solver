QUESTION:
A rectangle is inscribed between the $x$-axis and the parabola $y=36-x^2$ with one side along the $x$-axis, as shown in the figure below. Let $x$ denote the $x$-coordinate of the point highlighted in the figure. Write the area $A$ of the rectangle as a function of $x$.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the area \( A \) of the rectangle as a function of \( x \), we need to determine the height and width of the rectangle.

1. The height of the rectangle is given by the value of the function at \( x \), which is \( y = 36 - x^2 \).
2. The width of the rectangle is \( 2x \) because the rectangle's top side is directly under the curve from \( -x \) to \( x \).

Therefore, the area \( A \) of the rectangle can be expressed as:
\[ A(x) = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 2x \times (36 - x^2) \]

Expanding this product, we get:
\[ A(x) = 2x(36 - x^2) = 72x - 2x^3 \]

Thus, the area \( A \) of the rectangle as a function of \( x \) is:
\[ \boxed{A(x) = 72x - 2x^3} \]
