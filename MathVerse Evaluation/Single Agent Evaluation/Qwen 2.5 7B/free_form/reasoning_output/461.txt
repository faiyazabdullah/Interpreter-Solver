QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the radius of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the radius of the circle, we need to determine its distance from the center to any point on the circle that lies on one of the axes. From the graph, it appears that the circle intersects the y-axis at \(y = -2\) and the x-axis at \(x = 5\).

1. **Identify the center of the circle**:
   The center of the circle is located at the midpoint of these two points. Since the circle intersects the y-axis at \(y = -2\) and the x-axis at \(x = 5\), the center must be equidistant from these points. Thus, the center is at \((5, -2)\).

2. **Calculate the radius**:
   The radius is the distance from the center \((5, -2)\) to either of the intersection points, say \((5, 0)\). We can use the distance formula:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{(5 - 5)^2 + (0 - (-2))^2} = \sqrt{0 + 4} = \sqrt{4} = 2.
   \]

Final Answer: $r = 2$
