QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=-5\sin x

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the coordinates of the first maximum point of the function \( y = -5 \sin x \) for \( x \geq 0 \), we need to analyze the properties of the sine function and its transformations.

1. **Identify the standard sine function**: The standard sine function \( y = \sin x \) has its first maximum at \( x = 90^\circ \) (or \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians).

2. **Transform the sine function**: The function \( y = -5 \sin x \) is a vertical stretch and reflection of the standard sine function by a factor of 5 and a reflection over the x-axis due to the negative coefficient.

3. **Determine the maximum points**: Since the standard sine function has a maximum at \( x = 90^\circ \) and the negative coefficient reflects the graph over the x-axis, the maximum value of \( y = -5 \sin x \) occurs where \( \sin x \) is at its minimum, which is 0, but this does not happen at \( x = 90^\circ \). Instead, we need to find where \( \sin x \) is at its maximum, which is 1, but reflected to -1.

   The function \( y = -5 \sin x \) will have a maximum value when \( \sin x \) is at its minimum, i.e., \( \sin x = -1 \). This occurs at \( x = 270^\circ \) (or \( \frac{3\pi}{2} \) radians).

Thus, the coordinates of the first maximum point of \( y = -5 \sin x \) for \( x \geq 0 \) are:
