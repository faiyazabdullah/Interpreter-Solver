QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $(1.2,5.5)$ and an amplitude of 3.5 . What is the midline equation of the function?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the midline equation of the trigonometric function, we need to understand the structure of such a function. The general form of a sine wave is given by:

\[ y = A \sin(Bx - C) + D \]

where:
- \( A \) is the amplitude,
- \( B \) affects the period,
- \( C \) is the phase shift,
- \( D \) is the vertical shift (midline).

From the problem statement:
- The amplitude \( A \) is 3.5.
- The maximum point is at \( (1.2, 5.5) \), which gives us the vertical shift \( D \).

Since the maximum value of the sine function is \( A + D \):
\[ A + D = 5.5 \]
\[ 3.5 + D = 5.5 \]
\[ D = 5.5 - 3.5 \]
\[ D = 2 \]

The midline of the function is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the function's oscillation. This line is simply the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function. Given the amplitude and the maximum point, we can infer the midline as follows:

The midline is at \( y = D \).

Final Answer: \( y = 2 \)

Final Answer: $y = 2$
