QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with double arrows intersects with y-axis at -4 and 4. Its asymptote in dashed orange is $y=(4/5)x$ and $y=-(4/5)x$. There is also a green rectangular tangent to the hyperbola. Find the equation of the hyperbola.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of the hyperbola, let's start by using the standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin that opens left and right:

\[ \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \]

From the image, we know that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at \( y = 4 \) and \( y = -4 \). This means that the vertices of the hyperbola along the y-axis are at \( (0, 4) \) and \( (0, -4) \), which tells us that \( b = 4 \).

Next, we need to determine the value of \( a \). The asymptotes of the hyperbola are given as \( y = \frac{4}{5}x \) and \( y = -\frac{4}{5}x \). For a hyperbola of the form \( \frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \), the equations of the asymptotes are \( y = \pm \frac{b}{a} x \). Therefore, we can set up the following relationship:

\[ \frac{b}{a} = \frac{4}{5} \]

Given \( b = 4 \):

\[ \frac{4}{a} = \frac{4}{5} \]

Solving for \( a \):

\[ a = 5 \]

Now, substituting \( a = 5 \) and \( b = 4 \) into the standard form of the hyperbola:

\[ \frac{x^2}{5^2} - \frac{y^2}{4^2} = 1 \]

\[ \frac{x^2}{25} - \frac{y^2}{16} = 1 \]

Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is:

Final Answer: $\boxed{\frac{x^2}{25} - \frac{y^2}{16} = 1}$
