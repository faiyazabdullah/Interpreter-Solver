QUESTION:
At a point during the flight, a plane is 42 kilometres south and 57 kilometres west of the airport it left from.


Find the size of the angle marked b to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the size of angle \( b \) in the right triangle formed by the position of the plane relative to the airport.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The distance from the plane to the airport is 57 km (west).
   - The distance from the plane to the airport is 42 km (south).

2. **Visualize the situation:**
   - We have a right triangle where the legs are 57 km and 42 km, and the hypotenuse is the straight-line distance from the plane to the airport.

3. **Use trigonometric ratios:**
   - We need to find the angle \( b \). Since we know the lengths of the sides opposite and adjacent to angle \( b \), we can use the tangent function.
   - The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side.
   \[
   \tan(b) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{42}{57}
   \]

4. **Calculate the value of \( \tan(b) \):**
   \[
   \tan(b) = \frac{42}{57} \approx 0.7368
   \]

5. **Find the angle \( b \) using the inverse tangent function:**
   \[
   b = \tan^{-1}(0.7368)
   \]

6. **Use a calculator to find the angle in degrees:**
   \[
   b \approx 36.4^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the size of the angle \( b \) is approximately \( 36.4^\circ \).

Final Answer: $b \approx 36.4^\circ$
