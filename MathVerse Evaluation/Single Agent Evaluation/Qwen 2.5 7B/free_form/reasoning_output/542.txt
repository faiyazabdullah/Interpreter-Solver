QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 3.3\right)$, and it has a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 9.8)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the amplitude of the trigonometric function, we need to analyze the given points and the general form of a sine or cosine function.

The general form of such a function can be written as:
\[ y = A \sin(B(x + C)) + D \]
where \(A\) is the amplitude, \(B\) determines the period, \(C\) is the phase shift, and \(D\) is the vertical shift.

Given:
- The maximum point is at \((-2\pi, 9.8)\).
- The function intersects its midline at \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 3.3\right)\).

The midline of the function is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the oscillations. The vertical shift \(D\) can be found as the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function. Since the function passes through \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 3.3\right)\), which lies on the midline, \(D = 3.3\).

The amplitude \(A\) can be determined from the maximum value of the function. The maximum value is 9.8, so:
\[ A = \frac{\text{Maximum value} - \text{Midline}}{2} = \frac{9.8 - 3.3}{2} = \frac{6.5}{2} = 3.25 \]

Thus, the amplitude of the function is \(3.25\).

Final Answer: $3.25$
