QUESTION:
Consider the following diagram. The height of the dashed line in the figure is 68. The angle enclosed by the blue arc is 46°, and the angle enclosed by the red arc is 37°. Hence, use the rounded values of y and w to find x, correct to 1 decimal place.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \( x \), we need to analyze the geometry of the figure. Let's start by understanding the relationships between the sides and angles given in the problem.

1. **Identify the right triangles and their relationships:**
   - The figure consists of two right triangles formed by the dashed lines and the horizontal line segments.
   - The height of the dashed line is 68, and the angles given are 46° and 37°.

2. **Use trigonometric ratios to find the lengths \( w \) and \( y \):**
   - For the triangle with the 46° angle:
     \[
     \sin(46^\circ) = \frac{68}{w}
     \]
     Solving for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{68}{\sin(46^\circ)}
     \]
     Using a calculator:
     \[
     w \approx \frac{68}{0.7193} \approx 94.8 \quad (\text{rounded to 1 decimal place})
     \]

   - For the triangle with the 37° angle:
     \[
     \cos(37^\circ) = \frac{68}{y}
     \]
     Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{68}{\cos(37^\circ)}
     \]
     Using a calculator:
     \[
     y \approx \frac{68}{0.7986} \approx 85.2 \quad (\text{rounded to 1 decimal place})
     \]

3. **Calculate \( x \):**
   - \( x \) is the length of the horizontal segment that completes the rectangle. It can be found by adding \( w \) and \( y \):
     \[
     x = w + y
     \]
     Substituting the values:
     \[
     x \approx 94.8 + 85.2 = 180
     \]

Final Answer: $x = 180.0$
