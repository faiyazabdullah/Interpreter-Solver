QUESTION:
In the figure above, point B lies on side AC. This figure consists of triangles BCD and BAD. If 55 < x < 60, what is one possible value of y ?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given triangle \( \triangle BCD \) and \( \triangle BAD \). We know that point \( B \) lies on side \( AC \), and the measure of angle \( x \) is between 55 and 60 degrees. We need to find a possible value for angle \( y \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Angle \( x \) is between 55 and 60 degrees.
   - Point \( B \) lies on side \( AC \).
   - We need to find a possible value for angle \( y \).

2. **Understand the relationship between angles:**
   - In triangle \( \triangle BCD \), the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we can express the angles as follows:
     \[
     \angle CDB + \angle DBC + \angle DCB = 180^\circ
     \]
   - In triangle \( \triangle BAD \), the sum of the interior angles is also \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     \angle ADB + \angle DAB + \angle DBA = 180^\circ
     \]

3. **Analyze the relationship between the angles:**
   - Since point \( B \) lies on side \( AC \), angles \( \angle DBC \) and \( \angle DBA \) are adjacent angles at point \( B \). This implies that \( \angle DBC + \angle DBA = 180^\circ - \angle ABC \).

4. **Determine the range for \( y \):**
   - Given that \( 55 < x < 60 \), we need to find the corresponding range for \( y \).
   - The angle \( y \) is part of the larger triangle \( \triangle BCD \), so it must satisfy the conditions within the triangle's angle sum property.

5. **Possible value calculation:**
   - Let's assume \( x = 57^\circ \) (a midpoint within the given range).
   - Then, the remaining angles in \( \triangle BCD \) would sum up to \( 180^\circ - 57^\circ = 123^\circ \).

Given these considerations, a plausible value for \( y \) can be derived from the fact that \( y \) is part of the larger triangle and must be less than 123 degrees but greater than 0 degrees (since \( y \) is an internal angle).

### Final Answer:

Based on the above reasoning, a possible value for \( y \) is:

\[ y = 65^\circ \]

Final Answer: $y = 65^\circ$
