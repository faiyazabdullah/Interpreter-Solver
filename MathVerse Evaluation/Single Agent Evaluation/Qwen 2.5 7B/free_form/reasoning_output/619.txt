QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the diameter.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the diameter of the circle, we need to determine the distance between two opposite points on the circumference of the circle that lie on the same horizontal or vertical line.

1. The center of the circle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
2. The circle intersects the \(y\)-axis at \((0, 4)\) and \((0, -4)\), indicating a radius of 4.
3. The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-4, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\), indicating a radius of 4 as well.

Since the circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-4, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\), the diameter is the distance between these two points, which is \(8\).

Final Answer: $d = 8$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $d = 8$
