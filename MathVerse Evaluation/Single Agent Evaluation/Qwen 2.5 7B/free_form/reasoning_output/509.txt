QUESTION:
A line is parallel to x-axis at y=5. Write the inequality that describes the points in the shaded region.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the geometric relationships:

1. The line is parallel to the x-axis and has a constant y-coordinate of 5.
2. We need to find the inequality that describes the points in the shaded region.

From the image, we can observe that the shaded region extends infinitely in both the positive and negative x-directions but is bounded by the horizontal line \(y = 5\).

Given these observations, the shaded region includes all points where \(y \geq 5\). This means that any point \((x, y)\) in the shaded region will have a y-coordinate greater than or equal to 5.

Therefore, the inequality that describes the points in the shaded region is:
\[ y \geq 5 \]

Final Answer: $y \geq 5$
