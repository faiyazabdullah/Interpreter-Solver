QUESTION:
Two similar cylinders have volumes of 5760\mathrm{cm}^3 and 90\mathrm{cm}^3.


Find the fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to find the ratio of the volumes of two similar cylinders. The volumes of the cylinders are given as \(5760 \text{ cm}^3\) and \(90 \text{ cm}^3\).

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Identify the relationship between the volumes of similar cylinders:**
   Since the cylinders are similar, the ratio of their volumes is equal to the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions (like heights or radii).

2. **Set up the ratio:**
   Let's denote the height of the larger cylinder as \(h_1\) and the height of the smaller cylinder as \(h_2\). Given that the heights are not explicitly provided, but we know the volumes are directly related to the cubes of their heights, we can use the volumes to find the ratio.

3. **Use the volume formula for a cylinder:**
   The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   However, since the problem does not specify the radii, we only need to consider the heights for the volume ratio calculation.

4. **Calculate the volume ratio:**
   The volume ratio of the larger cylinder to the smaller cylinder is:
   \[
   \frac{V_1}{V_2} = \frac{5760 \text{ cm}^3}{90 \text{ cm}^3}
   \]

5. **Simplify the ratio:**
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{5760}{90} = 64
   \]

6. **Find the ratio of the heights:**
   Since the volumes are proportional to the cube of the heights, we take the cube root of the volume ratio to find the ratio of the heights:
   \[
   \left( \frac{V_1}{V_2} \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = \left( 64 \right)^{\frac{1}{3}} = 4
   \]

Therefore, the ratio of the heights of the larger cylinder to the smaller cylinder is \(4:1\).

### Final Answer:
The fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder is:
\[
\boxed{64}
\]
