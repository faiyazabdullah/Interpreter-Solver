QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the radius.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the radius of the circle, we need to determine its distance from the origin to any of its points of intersection with the coordinate axes. Since the circle intersects both the x-axis and y-axis at four points, it is centered at the origin $(0, 0)$.

Given that the circle intersects the x-axis at points $(2, 0)$ and $(-2, 0)$, and the y-axis at points $(0, 2)$ and $(0, -2)$, the radius can be calculated as the distance from the origin to one of these points. The distance from the origin to $(2, 0)$ is simply the absolute value of the x-coordinate, which is $2$. Similarly, the distance from the origin to $(0, 2)$ is simply the absolute value of the y-coordinate, which is also $2$.

Thus, the radius of the circle is $2$.

Final Answer: $r = 2$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $r = 2$
