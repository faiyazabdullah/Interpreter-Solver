QUESTION:
Write an equation for the transformation of f(x)=|x| as shown in the figure, which passes (-2, 1) and are piecewise.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the equation of the piecewise function that matches the transformation of \( f(x) = |x| \) as shown in the figure. The function should pass through the point \((-2, 1)\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the transformation:**
   The original function \( f(x) = |x| \) is a V-shaped graph that opens upwards with its vertex at the origin \((0, 0)\). The figure shows a transformation where the V-shape has been shifted downward by 1 unit.

2. **Determine the new function:**
   The new function can be written as \( g(x) = |x| - 1 \). This function maintains the same V-shape but shifts it downward by 1 unit.

3. **Verify the point \((-2, 1)\):**
   Substitute \( x = -2 \) into the function \( g(x) = |x| - 1 \):
   \[
   g(-2) = |-2| - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
   \]
   The function \( g(x) = |x| - 1 \) passes through the point \((-2, 1)\), confirming our transformation is correct.

### Final Answer:
The equation for the transformation of \( f(x) = |x| \) that passes through the point \((-2, 1)\) is:

Final Answer: $g(x) = |x| - 1$
