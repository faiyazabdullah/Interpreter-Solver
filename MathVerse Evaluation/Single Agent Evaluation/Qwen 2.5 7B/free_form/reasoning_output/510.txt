QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is -6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the intercepts**:
   - The x-intercept is at \( x = -3 \).
   - The y-intercept is at \( y = -6 \).

2. **Determine the equation of the line**:
   - The general form of a linear equation is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.
   - Given the y-intercept \( b = -6 \).
   - To find the slope \( m \), we can use the formula for slope between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
     \[
     m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
     \]
   - Using the intercepts \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, -6)\):
     \[
     m = \frac{-6 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{-6}{3} = -2
     \]
   - Therefore, the equation of the line is:
     \[
     y = -2x - 6
     \]

3. **Determine the inequality**:
   - The shaded region appears to be below the line, indicating that the inequality should be less than or equal to the line.
   - The inequality is:
     \[
     y \leq -2x - 6
     \]

Final Answer: $y \leq -2x - 6$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $y \leq -2x - 6$
