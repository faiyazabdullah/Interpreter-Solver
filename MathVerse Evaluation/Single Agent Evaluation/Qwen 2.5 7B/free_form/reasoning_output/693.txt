QUESTION:
An empty glass jar weighing 250g is in the shape of a cylinder which has a radius (r) of 15 cm and a height (h) of 26 cm.

Calculate its total weight when it is filled with water, correct to 2 decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the total weight of the glass jar when it is filled with water, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the cylindrical jar**: The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. Here, \( r = 15 \) cm and \( h = 26 \) cm.

   \[
   V = \pi \times (15)^2 \times 26
   \]
   \[
   V = \pi \times 225 \times 26
   \]
   \[
   V = 5850\pi \text{ cm}^3
   \]

2. **Convert the volume to milliliters**: Since \( 1 \text{ cm}^3 \) of water has a mass of approximately \( 1 \text{ g} \), the volume in milliliters is equal to the volume in cubic centimeters.

   \[
   \text{Volume of water} = 5850\pi \text{ mL}
   \]

3. **Calculate the mass of the water**: The mass \( m \) of the water is given by the density of water times the volume of water. Assuming the density of water is \( 1 \text{ g/mL} \):

   \[
   m_{\text{water}} = 5850\pi \text{ g}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the jar with water**: The total weight is the sum of the weight of the jar itself and the weight of the water.

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 250 \text{ g} + 5850\pi \text{ g}
   \]

5. **Round the result to 2 decimal places**: Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):

   \[
   5850\pi \approx 5850 \times 3.14159 = 18426.593 \text{ g}
   \]

   Therefore,

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 250 + 18426.593 = 18676.593 \text{ g}
   \]

   Rounding to 2 decimal places:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} \approx 18676.59 \text{ g}
   \]

Final Answer: $18676.59$
