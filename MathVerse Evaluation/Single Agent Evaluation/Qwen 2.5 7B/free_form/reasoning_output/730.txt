QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the height of the triangular prism is 8cm and the length of its right triangle's sides are 2cm and 4cm respectively. Find the volume of the triangular prism.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's solve the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the triangular prism**: The height \( h \) of the triangular prism is given as 8 cm. The base of the triangular prism is a right triangle with legs measuring 2 cm and 4 cm. The area of the base can be calculated using the formula for the area of a right triangle:
   \[
   \text{Area of base} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \, \text{cm} \times 4 \, \text{cm} = 4 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

2. **Calculate the volume of the triangular prism**: The volume \( V \) of a prism is given by the product of the area of the base and the height of the prism:
   \[
   V = \text{Area of base} \times \text{height}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   V = 4 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 8 \, \text{cm} = 32 \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

Final Answer: $V = 32 \, \text{cm}^3$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $V = 32 \, \text{cm}^3$
