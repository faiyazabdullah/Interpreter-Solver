QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the line whose x-intercept is 0.5 and y-intercept is 2. What is the slope of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the slope of the line, we can use the formula for the slope \( m \) which is given by:

\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

From the graph, we can identify the intercepts:
- The x-intercept is at \( (0.5, 0) \).
- The y-intercept is at \( (0, 2) \).

Let's use these points as \( (x_1, y_1) = (0, 2) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) = (0.5, 0) \):

\[ m = \frac{0 - 2}{0.5 - 0} = \frac{-2}{0.5} = -4 \]

Therefore, the slope of the line is:

Final Answer: $m = -4$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $m = -4$
