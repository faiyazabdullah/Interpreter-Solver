QUESTION:
In remote locations, photographers must keep track of their position from their base. One morning a photographer sets out from base, represented by point B, to the edge of an ice shelf at point S on a bearing of 055°. She then walked on a bearing of 145° to point P, which is 916 metres due east of base.

If the photographer were to walk back to her base from point P, what is the total distance she would have travelled? Round your answer to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance the photographer would travel if she walks directly from point P back to her base at point B.

First, let's break down the information provided:
- The angle between the north direction and the path from B to S is \(55^\circ\) (bearing 055°).
- The angle between the north direction and the path from S to P is \(145^\circ\).

Since the angle between the north direction and the path from S to P is \(145^\circ\), the angle between the south direction and the path from S to P is \(360^\circ - 145^\circ = 215^\circ\). This means the path from S to P forms a straight line with the north direction shifted by \(215^\circ\).

Next, we know that the photographer walked 916 meters due east from point B to point P. Therefore, the distance from point S to point P is also 916 meters.

Now, we can calculate the total distance the photographer would travel if she walks directly from point P back to point B. Since the distances are the same in both directions, the total distance is simply twice the distance from P to B.

Thus, the total distance traveled is:
\[ 2 \times 916 = 1832 \text{ meters} \]

Final Answer: $1832.0$
