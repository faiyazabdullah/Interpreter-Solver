QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of y=\sin x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(90^\circ ,1\right).

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=5\sin x

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the coordinates of the first maximum point of \( y = 5\sin x \), we need to understand how the sine function transforms under scalar multiplication. The function \( y = 5\sin x \) is a vertical stretch of the original sine function by a factor of 5. This means that the amplitude of the sine wave will be increased by a factor of 5, but the period remains the same.

The first maximum point of the standard sine function \( y = \sin x \) occurs at \( x = 90^\circ \). For the function \( y = 5\sin x \), the value at \( x = 90^\circ \) will be:

\[ y = 5 \cdot 1 = 5 \]

Thus, the first maximum point of \( y = 5\sin x \) is at \( (90^\circ, 5) \).

Final Answer: $$(90^\circ, 5)$$
