QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

How much faster is Oliver traveling?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine how much faster Oliver is traveling compared to Justin, we need to find the slopes of both lines and compare them. The slope of a line in a distance-time graph represents the speed of the cyclist.

1. **Identify the coordinates of the points:**
   - For Oliver: The point is at \((5, 175)\).
   - For Justin: The point is at \((5, 125)\).

2. **Calculate the slope of Oliver's line:**
   The slope \( m_O \) of a line passing through points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
   \[
   m_O = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Substituting the coordinates of Oliver's points:
   \[
   m_O = \frac{175 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{175}{5} = 35
   \]

3. **Calculate the slope of Justin's line:**
   Using the same formula for Justin's points:
   \[
   m_J = \frac{125 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{125}{5} = 25
   \]

4. **Determine the difference in speed:**
   The difference in speed between Oliver and Justin is:
   \[
   \Delta v = m_O - m_J = 35 - 25 = 10
   \]

Thus, Oliver is traveling \(\boxed{10}\) units per time unit faster than Justin.

Final Answer: $\boxed{10}$
