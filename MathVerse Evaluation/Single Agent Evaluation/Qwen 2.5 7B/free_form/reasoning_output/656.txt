QUESTION:
The following cylinder has a height of 49 m and a base radius of 21 m.

Find the surface area.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to calculate the lateral surface area and the area of the two circular bases. The formula for the total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ A = 2\pi r h + 2\pi r^2 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

Given:
- Radius \( r = 21 \) meters
- Height \( h = 49 \) meters

First, calculate the lateral surface area:

\[ \text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi r h = 2\pi (21)(49) \]

Next, calculate the area of one circular base:

\[ \text{Base Area} = \pi r^2 = \pi (21)^2 \]

Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:

\[ \text{Total Base Area} = 2 \pi r^2 = 2 \pi (21)^2 \]

Now, sum these two areas to get the total surface area:

\[ A = 2\pi (21)(49) + 2\pi (21)^2 \]

Let's compute the numerical values:

\[ 2\pi (21)(49) = 2\pi \times 1029 = 2058\pi \]
\[ 2\pi (21)^2 = 2\pi \times 441 = 882\pi \]

Adding these together:

\[ A = 2058\pi + 882\pi = 2940\pi \]

Finally, approximate the value of \(\pi\) as \(3.14159\) and compute the numerical value:

\[ A \approx 2940 \times 3.14159 \approx 9236.28 \]

Thus, the surface area of the cylinder is approximately:

Final Answer: $9236.28$
