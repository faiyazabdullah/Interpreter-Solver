QUESTION:
This is part of a piece of jewellery. It is made out of a metal plate base, and gold plated wire (of negligible thickness) runs around the outside.

What is the area covered by the metal plate base?

Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the area covered by the metal plate base, we need to calculate the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector.

1. **Identify the radii:**
   - The radius of the larger sector is \(6 \, \text{mm}\).
   - The radius of the smaller sector is \(3 \, \text{mm}\).

2. **Calculate the area of the larger sector:**
   The formula for the area of a sector is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
   \]
   Here, \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius. Since the full circle is \(360^\circ\), the area of the larger sector is:
   \[
   \text{Area}_{\text{large}} = \frac{360^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 6^2 = \pi \times 6^2 = 36\pi \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the smaller sector:**
   Similarly, the area of the smaller sector is:
   \[
   \text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \frac{360^\circ}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 3^2 = \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

4. **Find the area of the metal plate base:**
   The area of the metal plate base is the difference between the area of the larger sector and the area of the smaller sector:
   \[
   \text{Area}_{\text{base}} = \text{Area}_{\text{large}} - \text{Area}_{\text{small}} = 36\pi - 9\pi = 27\pi \, \text{mm}^2
   \]

5. **Round to two decimal places:**
   \[
   27\pi \approx 27 \times 3.1416 = 84.82
   \]

Thus, the area covered by the metal plate base is:
\[
\boxed{84.82}
\]

Final Answer: $84.82$
