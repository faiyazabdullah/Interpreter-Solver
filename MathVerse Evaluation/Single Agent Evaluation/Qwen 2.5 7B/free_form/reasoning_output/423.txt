QUESTION:
After two meteoroids collide at point A, one starts travelling in the direction of point B, while the other starts travelling in the direction of point C, with an angle of 53^\circ  between the two directions. The meteoroid projected in the direction of B is moving at a speed of 7860 km/h, while the other is moving at a speed of 10170 km/h.


What distance will the meteoroid travelling towards point B have covered after 29 minutes?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the distance that the meteoroid traveling towards point \( B \) has covered after 29 minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert time from minutes to hours**: Since the speed is given in km/h, we need to convert 29 minutes into hours.
   \[
   29 \text{ minutes} = \frac{29}{60} \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the distance**: The distance traveled is given by the formula \( \text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} \).
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 7860 \text{ km/h} \times \frac{29}{60} \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 7860 \times \frac{29}{60}
   \]
   First, calculate \( 7860 \div 60 \):
   \[
   7860 \div 60 = 131
   \]
   Then, multiply by 29:
   \[
   131 \times 29 = 3799
   \]

Therefore, the distance covered by the meteoroid traveling towards point \( B \) after 29 minutes is:
\[
\boxed{3799 \text{ km}}
\]

Final Answer: $3799 \text{ km}$
