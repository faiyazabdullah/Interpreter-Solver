QUESTION:
On an orienteering course, Valentina runs 550 metres north from point A to point B, then turns east and runs to point C. If the true bearing of C from A is 041 ^\circ T and the direct distance Valentina must run to get back to point A is d metres, find d to the nearest metre.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the direct distance \(d\) Valentina must run to return to point A from point C, given the true bearing of C from A as \(041^\circ\) and the horizontal displacement of 550 meters.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Identify Given Information:**
   - The horizontal distance AB is 550 meters.
   - The true bearing of C from A is \(041^\circ\).

2. **Understand the Bearing:**
   - The bearing \(041^\circ\) means that if you were at point A and facing north, you would turn \(41^\circ\) clockwise to face the direction of point C.
   - This forms a right triangle where AB is the horizontal leg, AC is the hypotenuse, and BC is the vertical leg.

3. **Apply Trigonometry:**
   - We can use the tangent function to relate the angle to the sides of the triangle.
   \[
   \tan(041^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{BC}{AB}
   \]
   - Here, the opposite side is BC (vertical distance), and the adjacent side is AB (horizontal distance).
   \[
   \tan(041^\circ) = \frac{BC}{550}
   \]

4. **Calculate BC:**
   - Using the value of \(\tan(041^\circ)\):
   \[
   BC = 550 \cdot \tan(041^\circ)
   \]
   - From trigonometric tables or a calculator:
   \[
   \tan(041^\circ) \approx 1.1826
   \]
   \[
   BC = 550 \cdot 1.1826 \approx 645.43 \text{ meters}
   \]

5. **Find the Hypotenuse AC:**
   - We use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse \(AC\):
   \[
   AC^2 = AB^2 + BC^2
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 = 550^2 + 645.43^2
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 = 302500 + 416885.1969
   \]
   \[
   AC^2 \approx 719385.1969
   \]
   \[
   AC \approx \sqrt{719385.1969} \approx 848.19 \text{ meters}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The direct distance \(d\) Valentina must run to get back to point A is approximately \(848.2 \text{ meters}\).

Final Answer: $848.2$
