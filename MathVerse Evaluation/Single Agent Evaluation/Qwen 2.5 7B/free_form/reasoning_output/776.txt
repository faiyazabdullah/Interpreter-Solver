QUESTION:
In the figure above. The graph consists of four lines l,m,n,p intersecting each other. Line l and line p are perpendicular. If the angle (not shown) where lines n and p intersect is twice as large as the angle (also not shown) where lines l and m intersect, what is the value of x?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Known Angles**:
   - Line \(l\) and line \(p\) are perpendicular, so they form right angles at their intersection. This means any angle formed by \(l\) and \(p\) is either \(90^\circ\) or \(270^\circ\). However, since we have another angle at the intersection of \(n\) and \(p\), which is \(110^\circ\), it implies that the angle at the intersection of \(l\) and \(p\) must be \(180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ\).

2. **Angle Relationships**:
   - Let the angle where lines \(l\) and \(m\) intersect be \(\theta\).
   - The angle where lines \(n\) and \(p\) intersect is given to be twice \(\theta\), so it is \(2\theta\).
   - Since the total sum of angles around point \(p\) is \(360^\circ\), we can write:
     \[
     70^\circ + 90^\circ + 110^\circ + 2\theta = 360^\circ
     \]

3. **Solve for \(\theta\)**:
   \[
   70^\circ + 90^\circ + 110^\circ + 2\theta = 360^\circ
   \]
   \[
   270^\circ + 2\theta = 360^\circ
   \]
   \[
   2\theta = 90^\circ
   \]
   \[
   \theta = 45^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine Angle \(x\)**:
   - The angle \(x\) is the angle formed by lines \(l\) and \(m\), which is \(\theta\).
   - Therefore, \(x = 45^\circ\).

Final Answer: $x = 45^\circ$
