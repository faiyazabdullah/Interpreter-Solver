QUESTION:
A triangular prism has as dimensions those labelled on the diagram. The AB edge has length of 10. The BC edge has length of 3. The CF edge has length of 15. The EX edge and FX edge have the equal length. Find z, the size of \angle BXC, correct to 2 decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve for \(\angle BXC\), we need to analyze the geometry of the triangular prism and the relationships within it. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify Key Points and Relationships**:
   - \(AB = 10\)
   - \(BC = 3\)
   - \(CF = 15\)
   - \(EX = FX\) implies that \(X\) is the midpoint of \(EF\).

2. **Understand the Geometry**:
   - The figure consists of two rectangular bases and three rectangular lateral faces.
   - Since \(EX = FX\), \(X\) is the midpoint of \(EF\), making \(X\) equidistant from both ends of \(EF\).

3. **Determine \(\angle BXC\)**:
   - The angle \(\angle BXC\) can be found by considering the right triangles formed by the height of the prism and the projections onto the base.
   - We need to find the length of \(BX\) and \(CX\).

4. **Calculate \(BX\) and \(CX\)**:
   - Since \(X\) is the midpoint of \(EF\), and \(EF\) is parallel to \(AB\) and lies in the plane perpendicular to the base, \(BX\) and \(CX\) form right triangles with \(BX\) being the hypotenuse of one and \(CX\) being the hypotenuse of another.
   - Using the Pythagorean theorem:
     \[
     BX = \sqrt{BC^2 + EX^2}
     \]
     \[
     CX = \sqrt{BC^2 + FX^2}
     \]
   - Given \(EX = FX\) and since \(X\) is the midpoint, we have \(EX = FX = \frac{15}{2}\).

5. **Calculate \(\angle BXC\)**:
   - Using the cosine rule in triangle \(BXC\):
     \[
     \cos(\angle BXC) = \frac{BX^2 + CX^2 - BC^2}{2 \cdot BX \cdot CX}
     \]
   - Substitute the values:
     \[
     BX = \sqrt{3^2 + \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 56.25} = \sqrt{65.25}
     \]
     \[
     CX = \sqrt{3^2 + \left(\frac{15}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 56.25} = \sqrt{65.25}
     \]
     \[
     \cos(\angle BXC) = \frac{65.25 + 65.25 - 9}{2 \cdot \sqrt{65.25} \cdot \sqrt{65.25}} = \frac{121.5}{2 \cdot 65.25} = \frac{121.5}{130.5} = 0.934
     \]
   - Therefore, \(\angle BXC = \cos^{-1}(0.934)\).

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - Using a calculator to find the inverse cosine:
     \[
     \angle BXC \approx 22.00^\circ
     \]

Final Answer: \( \boxed{22.00^\circ} \)
