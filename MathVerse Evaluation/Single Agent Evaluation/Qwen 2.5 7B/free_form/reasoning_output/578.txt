QUESTION:
Peter received a lump sum payment of $\$ 50000$ for an insurance claim (and decided not to put it in a savings account).

Every month, he withdraws $5 \%$ of the remaining funds.

The funds after $x$ months is shown below. The curve in the graph passes (0,5). y-axis labels"y('0000s)"

How much would the first withdrawal be?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the amount of the first withdrawal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount**: Peter starts with $50000.

2. **Monthly Withdrawal Rate**: Every month, he withdraws 5% of the remaining funds. This means that each month, he retains 95% of the remaining funds.

3. **Formula for Remaining Funds**: Let \( A_n \) be the amount of money after \( n \) months. The relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   A_{n} = A_{n-1} \times 0.95
   \]
   where \( A_0 = 50000 \).

4. **First Withdrawal Calculation**: After one month, the amount remaining is:
   \[
   A_1 = 50000 \times 0.95
   \]
   The first withdrawal is then:
   \[
   \text{First withdrawal} = 50000 - A_1 = 50000 - (50000 \times 0.95)
   \]

5. **Calculate the First Withdrawal**:
   \[
   \text{First withdrawal} = 50000 \times (1 - 0.95) = 50000 \times 0.05 = 2500
   \]

Thus, the first withdrawal is $2500.

Final Answer: $2500$
