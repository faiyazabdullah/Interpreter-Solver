QUESTION:
Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the centre of the circle. Write your answer in the form ( _ , _ ).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the center of the circle, we need to determine the point that is equidistant from both the intersection points with the x-axis and the y-axis.

1. **Identify the intersection points with the axes:**
   - The circle intersects the x-axis at two points, one on the left and one on the right.
   - The circle intersects the y-axis at one point, which is the topmost point of the circle.

2. **Determine the coordinates of the intersection points:**
   - The x-intercepts are at $(-6, 0)$ and $(0, 0)$.
   - The y-intercept is at $(0, 2)$.

3. **Find the center of the circle:**
   - The center of the circle will lie on the line perpendicular to the diameter passing through the midpoint of the chord formed by the x-intercepts.
   - The midpoint of the chord formed by the x-intercepts is $\left( \frac{-6 + 0}{2}, \frac{0 + 0}{2} \right) = (-3, 0)$.
   - The center also lies on the y-axis because the circle is symmetric about the y-axis.

4. **Determine the y-coordinate of the center:**
   - The center of the circle is directly above or below the y-intercept because it is equidistant from the x-intercepts.
   - Since the radius is consistent and the circle passes through the origin, the center must be at $(0, 2)$.

Thus, the center of the circle is $(0, 2)$.

Final Answer: $$(0, 2)$$
