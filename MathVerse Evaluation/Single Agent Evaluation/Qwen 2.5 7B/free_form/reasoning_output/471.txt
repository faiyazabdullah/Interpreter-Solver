QUESTION:
The following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0).

Find the equation of this semicircle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the equation of the semicircle, we need to determine its center and radius. The general equation of a circle is:

\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]

For a semicircle, we can use the fact that it is half of a full circle. The center of the semicircle will be the midpoint of the line segment joining the points where the semicircle intersects the x-axis, and the radius will be half of the distance between these intersection points.

The points where the semicircle intersects the x-axis are at \( (-7, 0) \) and \( (7, 0) \). Therefore, the center of the semicircle is at \( (0, k) \), and the radius \( r \) is 7.

Now we need to find the value of \( k \). We can use one of the given points, say \( (0, 7) \), to find \( k \):

\[ (0 - 0)^2 + (7 - k)^2 = 7^2 \]
\[ (7 - k)^2 = 49 \]
\[ 7 - k = \pm 7 \]

This gives us two possible values for \( k \):
\[ k = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad k = 14 \]

Since the point \( (0, 7) \) is above the x-axis, \( k = 14 \). Therefore, the center of the semicircle is \( (0, 14) \).

The equation of the semicircle is:

\[ x^2 + (y - 14)^2 = 49 \]

However, since it is a semicircle, we only consider the upper half of the circle. Thus, the equation of the semicircle is:

\[ x^2 + (y - 14)^2 = 49 \quad \text{for} \quad y \geq 14 \]

Final Answer: $x^2 + (y - 14)^2 = 49 \quad \text{for} \quad y \geq 14$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $x^2 + (y - 14)^2 = 49 \quad \text{for} \quad y \geq 14$
