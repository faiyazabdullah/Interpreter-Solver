QUESTION:
There is a linear function with a y-intercept of 3 and a x-intercept of 2. Determine the function expression of f shown in the figure.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the function expression of \( f \), we need to find the slope of the line and use the y-intercept to form the equation of the line.

1. **Identify the y-intercept**: The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. From the graph, it is at \( (0, 3) \).

2. **Identify the x-intercept**: The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. From the graph, it is at \( (2, 0) \).

3. **Calculate the slope**: The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Using the intercepts \((0, 3)\) and \((2, 0)\):
   \[
   m = \frac{0 - 3}{2 - 0} = \frac{-3}{2} = -1.5
   \]

4. **Form the equation of the line**: The general form of a linear equation is \( y = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept. Here, \( m = -1.5 \) and \( b = 3 \). So the equation is:
   \[
   y = -1.5x + 3
   \]

Final Answer: $f(x) = -1.5x + 3$

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $f(x) = -1.5x + 3$
