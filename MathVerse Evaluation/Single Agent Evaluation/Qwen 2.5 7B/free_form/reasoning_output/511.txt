QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is 6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve this problem, we need to determine the equation of the line and then derive the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the intercepts:**
   - The x-intercept is -3.
   - The y-intercept is 6.

2. **Determine the slope:**
   The slope \( m \) of a line can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Using the intercepts (-3, 0) and (0, 6):
   \[
   m = \frac{6 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
   \]

3. **Write the equation of the line:**
   Using the point-slope form of the line equation \( y = mx + b \), where \( b \) is the y-intercept:
   \[
   y = 2x + 6
   \]

4. **Determine the inequality:**
   The region drawn in the number plane appears to be below the line \( y = 2x + 6 \). Therefore, the inequality should represent the set of points below this line.

5. **Formulate the inequality:**
   The inequality for the region below the line \( y = 2x + 6 \) is:
   \[
   y < 2x + 6
   \]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y < 2x + 6}
\]
