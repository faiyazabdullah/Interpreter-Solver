QUESTION:
Consider the following cube with a side length equal to 6 cm. The nine marked edges have the same length. Find the total surface area.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Let's analyze the given problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify the cube's side length**:
   The side length of the cube is given as \(6 \, \text{cm}\).

2. **Understand the marked edges**:
   The problem states that there are nine edges marked, and these edges are supposed to be of the same length. In a cube, each edge has the same length. Therefore, the marked edges are not additional edges but rather the sides of the cube itself.

3. **Calculate the surface area of the cube**:
   A cube has six faces, and each face is a square with side length \(6 \, \text{cm}\). The area of one face is:
   \[
   \text{Area of one face} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]
   Since there are six faces, the total surface area \(A\) of the cube is:
   \[
   A = 6 \times 36 = 216 \, \text{cm}^2
   \]

Thus, the total surface area of the cube is:
Final Answer: $216 \, \text{cm}^2$
