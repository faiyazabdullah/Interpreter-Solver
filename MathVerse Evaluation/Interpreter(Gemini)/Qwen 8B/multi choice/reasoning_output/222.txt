MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two similar rectangles, one blue and one green. The question is asking for the value of x, which is the width of the second rectangle. 

First, I need to recall what it means for two shapes to be similar. Similar figures have corresponding angles equal and their sides in proportion. Since they're both rectangles, all angles are right angles, so that part is already satisfied. The key thing here is the ratio of their sides.

Given that Rectangle 1 has a width of 4 and an area of 8. Let me note down the given data:

For Rectangle 1:
- Width = 4
- Area = 8

For Rectangle 2:
- Width = x (this is what we need to find)
- Area = 32
- It's similar to Rectangle 1.

Since they are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. For rectangles, the ratio of length to width should be the same. Wait, but since they are similar, the ratio of their widths should be equal to the ratio of their lengths. But maybe I need to think about the area ratio instead.

Alternatively, the area ratio of similar figures is the square of the scale factor. So if the scale factor between the two rectangles is k, then the ratio of their areas would be k². 

Let me check that. Suppose the first rectangle has width w1 and height h1, and the second has width w2 and height h2. Since they are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. So w1/w2 = h1/h2 = k (the scale factor). Then the area of the first is w1*h1, and the second is w2*h2. Substituting, Area2/Area1 = (w2*h2)/(w1*h1) = (w2/w1)*(h2/h1) = k*k = k². Therefore, the ratio of areas equals the square of the scale factor.

So, given that, we can find the scale factor from the area ratio. 

First, compute the area ratio: Area2 / Area1 = 32 / 8 = 4. Therefore, the scale factor squared is 4, so the scale factor k is sqrt(4) = 2. That means each side of the second rectangle is twice as long as the corresponding side of the first.

But wait, the first rectangle's width is 4. If the scale factor is 2, then the width of the second rectangle should be 4*2=8? But wait, hold on. Wait, the scale factor could be either way depending on which figure is larger. Wait, the area of the second is bigger than the first (32 vs 8), so the second rectangle is larger. Therefore, the scale factor from the first to the second is 2. So the width of the second rectangle is 4 * 2 = 8. Therefore, x = 8. Which would be answer C. 

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the dimensions of the first rectangle. Since the first rectangle has width 4 and area 8, its height would be area divided by width: 8 / 4 = 2. So the first rectangle is 4 units wide and 2 units tall. 

Now, since the rectangles are similar, the ratio of width to height should be the same for both. For the first rectangle, the ratio is 4:2, which simplifies to 2:1. Therefore, for the second rectangle, the ratio of width to height should also be 2:1. Let me denote the width of the second rectangle as x, and its height as y. Then x/y = 2/1 => y = x/2. 

The area of the second rectangle is x * y = x*(x/2) = x²/2. According to the problem, this area is 32. So:

x² / 2 = 32  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
x² = 64  
Take square root:  
x = 8  

Therefore, x is 8. So the answer should be C. 

Wait, but let me check again. Another way: since the scale factor is 2, the width scales by 2. Original width was 4, so new width is 8. Yes, that's consistent. So the answer is C. 

Looking at the options, C is 8. So the correct answer is C.
