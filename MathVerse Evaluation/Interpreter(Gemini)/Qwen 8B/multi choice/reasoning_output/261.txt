MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rhombus LM PQ, with diagonals PL and QM intersecting at point R. We need to find the perimeter of the rhombus given some angle measures and a length. Let me start by recalling the properties of a rhombus.

First, in a rhombus, all sides are equal in length. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but here they mention that the diagonals PL and QM intersect at R, and there's a perpendicular relationship between them. That makes sense because in a rhombus, diagonals are perpendicular. Also, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. 

Now, looking at the given information. They say MeasureOf(Angle(QLM), 2x² - 10) and MeasureOf(Angle(QPM), 8x). Also, MP = 10. Since MP is one of the diagonals? Wait, MP is part of the rhombus. Wait, the points are L, M, P, Q. Let me try to visualize the rhombus. 

Wait, the Line(M,P) is given, so MP is a side? Or is it a diagonal? Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. But if the rhombus is labeled L, M, P, Q, maybe the order is such that the vertices are connected as L-M-P-Q-L? Wait, but the lines given are Line(L,M), Line(M,P), Line(P,Q), Line(Q,L). So that forms a quadrilateral. Then also Line(P,L) and Line(Q,M). Wait, those would be the two diagonals. Because in a rhombus, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So if the vertices are L, M, P, Q arranged in order, then the diagonals would be LP and MQ. Which matches the given lines: Line(P,L) and Line(Q,M). 

So, diagonals PL and QM intersect at R. And since it's a rhombus, these diagonals should bisect each other at right angles. Also, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. 

Given that, the angles mentioned: Angle QLM and Angle QPM. Let me parse that. 

Angle QLM is at point L, between points Q, L, M. Similarly, Angle QPM is at point P, between points Q, P, M. 

But wait, in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. Also, the diagonals split the angles into halves. 

Also, the measure of Angle QLM is given as 2x² -10, and Angle QPM is 8x. Additionally, MP is given as 10. Wait, MP is a side or a diagonal? Let me check. The line MP connects points M and P. In the rhombus, if the sides are LM, MP, PQ, QL, then MP is a side. Wait, but in a rhombus, all sides are equal. However, the problem says LengthOf(Line(M,P), 10). So MP is a side of the rhombus, hence all sides are 10? Wait, but then the perimeter would be 4*10=40, which is option B. But wait, hold on. Maybe I'm missing something here. Because the problem gives more information about angles, so perhaps MP isn't a side?

Wait, let's re-examine the lines. The lines given are Line(L,M), Line(M,P), Line(P,Q), Line(Q,L). These form the sides of the quadrilateral. So LM, MP, PQ, QL are the sides. Therefore, MP is indeed a side of the rhombus. Hence, all sides are equal. So if MP = 10, then each side is 10, making the perimeter 40. But why give the angle measures then? There must be more to it. Perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, but maybe MP is a diagonal. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily equal unless it's a square. So if MP is a diagonal, then its length would be different from the sides. Let me check again the given lines. The lines are:

Line(L,M)

Line(M,P)

Line(P,Q)

Line(Q,L)

So connecting L to M, M to P, P to Q, Q to L. So the figure is a quadrilateral with vertices L, M, P, Q connected in that order. Therefore, the sides are LM, MP, PQ, QL. Thus, MP is a side, not a diagonal. The diagonals would be LP and MQ. So the diagonals are Line(P,L) and Line(Q,M), which intersect at R. 

Therefore, MP is a side of the rhombus, so all sides are equal. Given that LengthOf(Line(M,P)) is 10, so each side is 10. Then perimeter is 4*10=40. But then why do they provide angle measures and other info? Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps MP is a diagonal. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the labeling of the rhombus is different. Maybe the order is not sequential. For example, in a rhombus, the vertices are usually labeled in order, so that consecutive letters are connected. But if the lines given are LM, MP, PQ, QL, then yes, that would make the sides LM, MP, PQ, QL. Therefore, MP is a side. But then the diagonals are LP and MQ. 

Wait, but the problem states Rhombus(L,M,P,Q). So the order of the points is L, M, P, Q forming the rhombus. Therefore, the sides are LM, MP, PQ, QL. Therefore, MP is a side. So the length of MP is 10, so each side is 10. Then perimeter is 40, which would be answer B. But the presence of angle measures suggests that maybe we need to verify that MP is indeed a side, or perhaps there's another way.

But let's look at the other given information. The problem mentions that IsDiagonalOf(Line(P,L), Rhombus(L,M,P,Q)). So Line(P,L) is a diagonal of the rhombus. Similarly, Line(Q,M) is another diagonal. So the diagonals are PL and QM. Therefore, MP is a side. 

However, there's also the fact that the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Also, in a rhombus, the diagonals divide it into four right triangles. Each half of the diagonals forms legs of these right triangles. 

Moreover, the problem gives angle measures: angle QLM is 2x² -10 and angle QPM is 8x. Also, there's a relation that equals the measure of angle QPM to measure of angle QLM. Wait, the last predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Q,P,M)),MeasureOf(Angle(Q,L,M))). So angle QPM equals angle QLM. 

Wait, angle QPM is at point P, between Q, P, M. And angle QLM is at point L, between Q, L, M. Since it's a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. But maybe these angles are related via the diagonals. 

Let me try to draw this mentally. In rhombus LMPQ, with diagonals PL and QM intersecting at R. So, diagonals bisect each other. Also, the diagonals bisect the angles. So angle QLM is one of the angles formed at vertex L. Since diagonals bisect the angles, angle QLM would be half of angle at L. Wait, but angle QLM is given as 2x² -10. Also, angle QPM is 8x, and they are equal. 

Wait, but if angle QPM equals angle QLM, then 2x² -10 = 8x. Solving this equation could give us the value of x, which may be necessary for finding the angles. However, since we already know that MP is a side of length 10, maybe the angles relate to the diagonals' lengths? 

But let's see. Let me proceed step by step.

First, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So LM = MP = PQ = QL. Given that MP = 10, so each side is 10, perimeter is 40. However, the problem gives angle measures, which might imply that there's more complexity. But perhaps the angles are used to confirm that the diagonals satisfy certain conditions. 

Alternatively, maybe MP is not a side. Wait, if the diagonals are PL and QM, then MP would be a side. But maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I misread the labels. Let me check again.

The given lines are Line(L,M), Line(M,P), Line(P,Q), Line(Q,L). So LM, MP, PQ, QL are the sides. Therefore, MP is a side. Hence, the length of MP is 10. So each side is 10. Therefore, the perimeter is 4*10=40. So answer B. But why give angle measures? Maybe there's a trick here. 

Wait, but maybe the problem is that MP is actually a diagonal. Let me check again. Suppose the rhombus is named L, M, P, Q, but the diagonals are LP and MQ. So if the diagonals are LP and MQ, then the sides would be LM, MP, PQ, QL. Wait, if LP is a diagonal, then points L and P are opposite vertices. So in that case, the sides would be LM, MP, PQ, QL. So MP connects M to P, which are adjacent vertices? No, if L and P are opposite vertices, then M and Q would be the other pair. Wait, maybe the order of the rhombus is L, M, Q, P? Not sure. This confusion arises from the labeling. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rhombus is L, M, P, Q connected such that LM, MP, PQ, QL are the sides. Then, the diagonals would be LP and MQ. Therefore, the diagonals are PL and QM. 

But in that case, the diagonals are PL and QM, and they intersect at R. Now, since the diagonals bisect each other, PR = RL and QR = RM. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular. 

Additionally, the angles at the vertices. For instance, angle QLM is at vertex L, between points Q, L, M. In a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. Also, the diagonals bisect the angles. 

But according to the given, angle QLM is 2x² -10 and angle QPM is 8x, and they are equal. So setting 2x² -10 = 8x → 2x² -8x -10 =0 → x² -4x -5 =0 → x=(4±√(16+20))/2 = (4±√36)/2 = (4±6)/2. So x= (4+6)/2=5 or x=(4-6)/2=-1. Since angle measures can't be negative, x=5. 

Then, substituting back, angle QLM = 2*(5)^2 -10 = 2*25 -10 = 50-10=40 degrees. Similarly, angle QPM=8x=40 degrees. So both angles are 40 degrees. 

Now, how does this relate to the rest? Well, since in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at L plus angle at M equals 180 degrees. But if angle QLM is 40 degrees, that's one of the angles at vertex L. Wait, but in a rhombus, each angle is determined by the diagonals. 

Alternatively, since the diagonals bisect the angles, angle QLM is half of angle at L. Wait, no. If the diagonals bisect the angles, then angle QLM is part of the angle at L. Let me think. 

At vertex L, the angles are between sides QL and LM. The diagonal PL splits this angle into two equal parts. So angle QLM is one of those two angles created by the diagonal. Therefore, angle QLM is half of the angle at vertex L. Similarly, angle QPM is at vertex P, between QP and PM. Since the diagonals bisect the angles, angle QPM is half of the angle at vertex P. 

In a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at L + angle at P = 180 degrees. Since angle at L is twice angle QLM (which is 40°), so angle at L is 80°, and angle at P is 100°, since they are supplementary. Wait, but angle QPM is 40°, which is half of angle at P. So angle at P is 80°, which contradicts the earlier conclusion. Hmm, there's inconsistency here. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let's clarify. 

Let me denote the angles at each vertex. In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. Adjacent angles are supplementary. 

Suppose angle at L is ∠QLM + ∠PLM (since diagonal PL divides it). Wait, no. At vertex L, the angle is between sides QL and LM. The diagonal PL splits this angle into two equal parts. So each part is half of the original angle. So ∠QLM is half of the angle at L. Similarly, ∠QPM is half of the angle at P. 

Given that ∠QLM = 40°, so the full angle at L is 80°. Then, since adjacent angles are supplementary, the angle at P would be 180° - 80° = 100°, so the angle at P is 100°, which means that ∠QPM (half of it) would be 50°, but according to our previous calculation, ∠QPM was 40°, leading to contradiction. 

This suggests that my earlier assumption that ∠QLM is half of the angle at L is incorrect. Where is the error here?

Wait, let's consider the diagram. Let me label the rhombus L, M, P, Q. The diagonals are PL and QM intersecting at R. So, at vertex L, the sides are QL and LM. The diagonal from L to P splits the angle at L into two angles: one is ∠QLR and the other is ∠PLM. Wait, but the given angle is ∠QLM, which is the angle at L between QL and LM. Wait, but the diagonal PL passes through R, splitting ∠QLM into two angles. Wait, no—wait, if the diagonal is PL, then it goes from P to L. So at point L, the diagonal PL extends from L to P, creating an angle between QL and LP, and between LP and LM? No, wait, the diagonal PL starts at P and ends at L. So at point L, the diagonal is PL. So the angle between QL and LP is one part, and the angle between LP and LM is another part. Wait, but the given angle is ∠QLM, which is between QL and LM. So that entire angle is being split by the diagonal PL into two angles. Therefore, ∠QLM is the total angle at L, which is split into two equal parts by the diagonal. Therefore, each of those parts is (∠QLM)/2. 

But earlier, we found that ∠QLM = 40°, implying that the full angle at L is 40°, but that doesn't make sense because adjacent angles in a rhombus are supplementary. Wait, this seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe I got the angle names wrong. The angle ∠QLM is at point L, with segments QL and LM. So that is the angle between QL and LM, which is the angle at vertex L. But in that case, if the diagonal PL bisects this angle, then each of the two angles created by the diagonal would be half of ∠QLM. 

But then, if ∠QLM is 40°, then the full angle at L is 40°, which would mean that the adjacent angle at M would be 140°, since they are supplementary. But then, the angle at P would be equal to the angle at L (since opposite angles are equal), so angle at P is also 40°, making adjacent angles supplementary: 40 + 140 = 180. Wait, that works. But earlier, we had ∠QPM = 40°, which is supposed to be half of the angle at P. If angle at P is 40°, then ∠QPM would be half of that, which is 20°, but we found ∠QPM = 40°, leading to inconsistency. 

This suggests a contradiction, indicating a mistake in my reasoning. Let me re-express the angle relations.

Let me consider that ∠QPM is at point P, between QP and PM. Since the diagonal QM passes through R, and it bisects the angle at P. So ∠QPM is half of the angle at P. Similarly, ∠QLM is half of the angle at L. 

From the problem, ∠QLM = 2x² -10 and ∠QPM =8x, and they are equal. So:

2x² -10 = 8x  
=> 2x² -8x -10 =0  
Divide by 2: x² -4x -5 =0  
Solution: x = [4 ± sqrt(16 +20)] /2 = [4 ± sqrt(36)]/2 = [4 ±6]/2 → x=5 or x=-1. Discard negative, so x=5.  

Thus, ∠QLM = 2*(5)^2 -10 = 50-10=40°, and ∠QPM=8*5=40°. 

So both angles are 40°. 

Now, if ∠QLM is half of the angle at L, then the full angle at L is 80°, and similarly, ∠QPM is half of the angle at P, so the full angle at P is 80°. 

But in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at L + angle at M = 180°, and angle at M + angle at P = 180°, etc. Wait, if angle at L is 80°, then angle at M is 100°, and angle at P is 80°, angle at Q is 100°. That fits. 

But then, the angle at P is 80°, so ∠QPM is half of that, which would be 40°, matching the given value. 

So that works. So the angles at L and P are 80°, and angles at M and Q are 100°. 

Now, knowing the angles, how does this help us find the perimeter? Well, the sides are all equal, but we were told that MP = 10. So if MP is a side, then each side is 10, so perimeter is 40. But why did the problem give angle measures? Because maybe MP isn't a side. Wait, but earlier analysis suggested that MP is a side. 

Wait, but let me double-check. If the diagonals are PL and QM, and MP is a side, then MP is one of the sides. But in a rhombus, the diagonals are not equal to the sides. Unless it's a square. 

But since the angles are 80° and 100°, it's not a square. Therefore, the diagonals are not equal. 

But the problem gives the length of MP as 10. If MP is a side, then all sides are 10, giving perimeter 40. But maybe there's another way to calculate it using the angles and the diagonals? 

Wait, alternatively, perhaps MP is a diagonal. Wait, if MP were a diagonal, then the length of the diagonal would be 10. Let's explore that possibility. 

Assuming MP is a diagonal. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. The formula relating the diagonals to the sides and angles is: 

For a rhombus with side length s, and angles θ and 180°−θ, the lengths of the diagonals d1 and d2 can be found using:

d1 = 2s sin(θ/2)  
d2 = 2s cos(θ/2)  

Or wait, more accurately, the diagonals are given by:

d1 = 2s sin(α/2), where α is one of the angles, and d2 = 2s cos(α/2). Wait, I need to recall the exact relation. 

Actually, the diagonals of a rhombus can be calculated using the formulas:

d1 = 2s * sin(theta)  
d2 = 2s * cos(theta) ?

No, better to use trigonometry. Let's consider one of the angles. For example, take angle at L, which is 80°. The diagonals split this angle into two equal parts of 40°. Using the law of cosines on the triangles formed by the diagonals. 

Each half-diagonal can be considered as follows. Let’s denote the diagonals as d1 (PL) and d2 (QM). They intersect at R, which is the midpoint. So PR = RL = d1/2, and QR = RM = d2/2. 

Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the triangles formed are right-angled. For instance, triangle PRL is a right triangle with legs PR and RL, and hypotenuse PL. Wait, no—actually, the diagonals are perpendicular, so the triangles formed are right-angled at R. 

Take triangle PRL: it is a right triangle with legs PR and LR, and hypotenuse PL. Wait, but PL is a diagonal. Wait, no—PR is half of diagonal PL, and LR is half of diagonal QM? No, the diagonals are PL and QM. So the intersection point R divides each diagonal into two equal parts. So PR = RL = (diagonal PL)/2, and QR = RM = (diagonal QM)/2. 

Now, considering the right triangle formed by the diagonals. For example, triangle PRL is a right triangle with legs PR and RL, but RL is half of QM, not PL. Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me clarify. 

In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and bisect each other. So if diagonals are d1 and d2, then each half of the diagonals are d1/2 and d2/2. The sides of the rhombus can be found using Pythagoras: s = sqrt((d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2). 

But we know one of the diagonals? Wait, if MP is a diagonal, then its length is 10. But earlier assumption was that MP is a side. So if MP is a diagonal, then we can use the angles to find the diagonals. 

But we need to determine whether MP is a side or a diagonal. 

Earlier, the problem says that Line(M,P) is given as a side, since it's part of the quadrilateral LM PQ. However, the problem also states that Line(P,L) is a diagonal. So MP is a side, not a diagonal. 

So, if MP is a side, then the length of each side is 10, so perimeter is 4*10=40. But the problem includes angle measures which seem unrelated. However, the presence of the angles might indicate that there's an alternative approach. 

Wait, but maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me recheck. If MP is a side, and the diagonals are PL and QM, then the diagonals can be computed using the angles. 

We know the angles at L and P are 80°, and at M and Q are 100°. 

Using the formula for the diagonals in terms of angles. For a rhombus with side length s and angles θ and φ (where θ + φ = 180°), the lengths of the diagonals are:

d1 = 2s * sin(θ/2)  
d2 = 2s * cos(θ/2)  

Wait, no. Actually, the diagonals can be expressed as:

d1 = 2s * sin(α/2) where α is one of the angles, and d2 = 2s * cos(α/2)? Wait, let me think. 

Consider angle at vertex L is 80°, and the diagonals split it into two angles of 40°. In the right triangle formed by half the diagonals and the side. Let's take one of the right triangles formed by the diagonals. For example, triangle formed by half of diagonal QM (say, QR) and half of diagonal PL (RL), and the side LM. 

Wait, the diagonals intersect at R, so each half-diagonal is (d1/2) and (d2/2). Then, the side s can be calculated using Pythagoras: s² = (d1/2)² + (d2/2)². 

But we also know that the diagonals are related to the angles. Specifically, tan(angle/2) = (d1/2)/(d2/2) = d1/d2. 

Wait, in the triangle formed by half of each diagonal, the tangent of half the angle at the vertex is equal to the ratio of the half-diagonals. 

For example, at vertex L, which has angle 80°, the half-angle is 40°. The tangent of 40° equals (opposite/adjacent) = (half of diagonal QM) / (half of diagonal PL). 

Let me formalize this. 

Let’s denote d1 as the length of diagonal PL and d2 as the length of diagonal QM. 

At vertex L, the angle is 80°, so half-angle is 40°. The tangent of 40° is equal to (d2/2) / (d1/2) = d2/d1. 

Similarly, at vertex P, the angle is 80°, so same ratio. 

Alternatively, at vertex M, which has angle 100°, the half-angle is 50°, and the tangent of 50° would be (d1/2)/(d2/2) = d1/d2. Wait, this depends on which diagonal corresponds to which half-angle. 

This might get complicated, but let's try. 

We have two equations:

tan(40°) = d2/d1  
and  
tan(50°) = d1/d2  

Because at vertex L, the half-angle is 40°, and the tangent of that is (opposite over adjacent), where opposite is half of diagonal QM (d2/2) and adjacent is half of diagonal PL (d1/2), hence d2/d1. 

At vertex M, which has angle 100°, the half-angle is 50°, and the tangent of that is (opposite/adjacent) = (half of diagonal PL) / (half of diagonal QM) = d1/d2. 

So we have:

tan(40°) = d2/d1  
tan(50°) = d1/d2  

Multiplying these two equations: tan(40°)*tan(50°) = (d2/d1)*(d1/d2) = 1. 

Indeed, tan(40°)*tan(50°) ≈ tan(40°)*tan(50°) ≈ 0.8391 * 1.191753592 ≈ 1.0000... which checks out. 

So this confirms consistency. 

Now, from the first equation: d2 = d1 * tan(40°). 

We also know that the sides are s = sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ). 

Given that s is the length of each side, which we initially thought was 10. But if MP is a side, then s=10. 

But let's verify this. 

If s=10, then:

s² = (d1² + d2²)/4  
=> 100 = (d1² + d2²)/4  
=> d1² + d2² = 400  

But from earlier, d2 = d1 * tan(40°). Let me compute tan(40°): approximately 0.8391. 

Let me denote t = tan(40°) ≈ 0.8391. 

Then, d2 = t*d1. 

Substitute into d1² + d2² = 400:

d1² + t²*d1² = 400  
=> d1² (1 + t²) = 400  
=> d1 = sqrt(400/(1 + t²))  

Calculate t²: t² ≈ 0.8391² ≈ 0.704. 

So denominator is 1 + 0.704 = 1.704. 

Thus, d1 ≈ sqrt(400 / 1.704) ≈ sqrt(234.7) ≈ 15.32 units. 

Then d2 = t*d1 ≈ 0.8391 * 15.32 ≈ 12.83 units. 

But how does this relate to the given data? The problem says MP=10, which we assumed to be a side. So this seems consistent. 

But the problem also mentions that MP is a side. So the length of each side is 10, hence perimeter is 4*10=40. 

But then why is the problem providing angle measures? It might be to confirm that the diagonals are consistent with the side length. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given MP is not a side. Let me reconsider. 

Wait, the problem says LengthOf(Line(M,P), 10). If MP is a diagonal, then we can find the diagonals and thus find the side length. 

But how can we know if MP is a diagonal or a side? Let me re-examine the structure of the rhombus. 

The rhombus is defined as L, M, P, Q. The lines given are LM, MP, PQ, QL, forming the sides. Therefore, MP is a side. Hence, the length of MP is 10, so each side is 10. 

Therefore, the perimeter is 4*10=40, which is option B. 

But why give the angle measures? It might be a red herring, or it might be to ensure that the diagonals are consistent. 

Wait, but if MP is a side of length 10, then the diagonals can be calculated as above, and the angles are consistent. 

Therefore, despite the angle measures, the perimeter is 40, so answer B. 

But to confirm, let me check if there's any other interpretation. 

Another possibility: perhaps the problem uses MP as a diagonal. Let's assume that MP is a diagonal. Then, its length is 10. 

In that case, using the earlier equations, if MP is a diagonal, say d1 = 10. Then, using the earlier relation:

d1 = 10 = 2*s*sin(theta/2), where theta is one of the angles. 

Wait, but without knowing theta, it's hard to proceed. However, we have the angles calculated as 80° and 100°. 

Let me try. Assume that MP is the longer diagonal, which is associated with the smaller angle. 

In a rhombus, the longer diagonal corresponds to the smaller angle. 

Since the angles are 80° and 100°, the smaller angle is 80°, so the longer diagonal corresponds to it. Wait, no: the longer diagonal is opposite the larger angle. 

Actually, the diagonals are related to the angles. The formula for the diagonals is:

d1 = 2s*sin(theta/2)  
d2 = 2s*cos(theta/2)  

Where theta is one of the angles. 

Assume that theta is 80°, then:

d1 = 2s*sin(40°)  
d2 = 2s*cos(40°)  

But which diagonal is which? The diagonal corresponding to the angle theta is the one that splits it. 

Alternatively, the formula might be:

For a rhombus with side s and angles α and β (α + β = 180°), the diagonals are:

d1 = 2s*sin(α/2)  
d2 = 2s*sin(β/2)  

Wait, but since β = 180° - α, sin(β/2) = sin(90° - α/2) = cos(α/2). So the diagonals are d1 = 2s*sin(α/2), d2 = 2s*cos(α/2). 

So if alpha is 80°, then d1 = 2s*sin(40°), d2 = 2s*cos(40°). 

If MP is one of the diagonals, say d1 = 10, then:

10 = 2s*sin(40°)  
=> s = 10 / (2*sin(40°)) ≈ 10 / (2*0.6428) ≈ 10 / 1.2856 ≈ 7.778. 

Then the perimeter would be 4*s ≈ 31.11, which is not among the options. 

Alternatively, if MP is the other diagonal, d2 = 10 = 2s*cos(40°), then s = 10/(2*cos(40°)) ≈ 10/(2*0.7660) ≈ 10/1.532 ≈ 6.526, perimeter ≈ 26.1, still not matching the options. 

So this suggests that MP cannot be a diagonal. Hence, MP must be a side, length 10, leading to perimeter 40. 

Thus, the correct answer is B.
