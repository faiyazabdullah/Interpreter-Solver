QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of y=\sin x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(90^\circ ,1\right).

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the first maximum point of the function y = 5 sin x for x ≥ 0. The original sine function y = sin x has its first maximum at (90°, 1). Now, we need to consider how the transformation affects this maximum point.

First, I should recall what transformations affect the sine function. The general form is y = A sin(Bx + C) + D. In this case, our function is y = 5 sin x, so A is 5, B is 1, C is 0, and D is 0. The amplitude of the sine function is determined by |A|. So, the amplitude here is 5, which means the graph is vertically stretched by a factor of 5. 

The vertical stretch affects the amplitude but doesn't change the period or the phase shift. Since there's no horizontal compression or stretching (because B is 1), the period remains 360 degrees. Also, since there's no phase shift (C=0) or vertical shift (D=0), the graph isn't shifted left/right or up/down.

The maximum value of the original sine function is 1, occurring at x = 90°, 90° + 360°n where n is an integer. When we multiply the entire function by 5, the maximum value becomes 5*1 = 5. However, the x-value where this maximum occurs doesn't change because the transformation is purely vertical. Therefore, the first maximum point for x ≥ 0 should still be at x = 90°, but with y-coordinate 5. 

Wait, but the problem mentions that the original function passes through those points like (0,0), (90,1), etc., and is symmetric about the origin. But since we're dealing with y = 5 sin x, the shape is just a vertical scaling. So the maximum point would be at the same x-value as before, but scaled vertically. Hence, the first maximum point is still at x = 90°, y = 5. 

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The original maximum was at (90°, 1). Stretching vertically by 5 scales the y-values, so the new maximum is 5 times higher. So yes, the x-coordinate remains 90°, and y becomes 5. Therefore, the first maximum point is (90°, 5). 

Looking back at the answer choices, even though they aren't listed here, but according to standard problems, the answer should be (90°, 5). But since the user hasn't provided options, perhaps the answer is supposed to be (90, 5). But in the absence of specific options, the correct coordinates would be (90°, 5). However, the initial problem statement says "state the coordinates of the first maximum point", so unless there's a different transformation, it's straightforward. 

Therefore, the answer should be (90, 5). But since the user mentioned answer choices as A-D, but in the problem description, the assistant is to select from them. Wait, the original problem didn't list answer choices, but the user said "ANSWER CHOICES: No choices found." So maybe the intended answer is (90, 5), but since there's no options, the system might expect a certain format. However, the instructions say to pick from A-D. But without knowing the actual choices, perhaps the answer is (90, 5), which corresponds to option A if A is that. But since the user hasn't given options, maybe the answer is simply (90,5), but the system requires selecting one of A-D. Hmm. Maybe there was an error in the setup. But given the original problem, the correct answer is (90°, 5). Assuming that the answer choices have that as option A, then Final Answer: A.
