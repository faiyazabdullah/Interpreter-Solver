MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have a rhombus ABCD. In a rhombus, all sides are equal, and opposite sides are parallel. Also, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but here they mention points M and N on AB and CD respectively such that AM equals CN. Then, lines MN and AC intersect at point O. Also, there's some information about angles and congruent triangles.

Given that angle DAC is 28 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle OBC. 

Let me try to visualize the diagram. Since ABCD is a rhombus, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at the center. But here, MN connects points M on AB and N on CD. Given that AM = CN, so maybe M and N are positioned symmetrically? Also, since MN intersects AC at O, and we have triangles AMO and CNO being congruent. 

Wait, the predicates say Triangle(A,M,O) and Triangle(C,N,O) are congruent. So by congruence, corresponding parts are equal. That would mean AO = CO, because those are corresponding sides? Wait, if the triangles are congruent, then AM = CN (given), MO = NO, and AO = CO? Or maybe different correspondence. Let me think. 

But first, since ABCD is a rhombus, diagonals AC and BD bisect each other. However, in this case, O is the intersection of AC and MN, not necessarily the center unless MN passes through the center. But given that AM = CN, perhaps O is the midpoint? Wait, there's a predicate saying IsMidpointOf(O, Line(A,C)). Oh! So O is the midpoint of diagonal AC. Therefore, AO = OC. 

So since O is the midpoint of AC, and also lies on MN. Also, AM = CN. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me place the rhombus in coordinate system. 

Let me assume point A is at (0,0). Since it's a rhombus, suppose side AB is along x-axis. Let’s denote AB = BC = CD = DA = s. Let’s assign coordinates accordingly. But since angle DAC is 28 degrees, which is angle at A between DA and AC. Wait, angle DAC is part of the rhombus. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So angle DAC would be half of angle BAD? Wait, no. Wait, angle BAD is one of the internal angles. The diagonals split the angles into two equal parts. For example, diagonal AC splits angle BAD into two equal angles. So if angle BAD is θ, then angle BAC is θ/2. Similarly, angle DAC would be θ/2?

Wait, but given angle DAC is 28 degrees. So angle between DA and AC is 28 degrees. Since DA is one side, and AC is a diagonal. Therefore, angle between DA and AC is 28 degrees. Which implies that angle BAC is equal to angle DAC? Wait, no. Because in a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me set up coordinates. Let me take point A at origin (0,0). Let me take diagonal AC as x-axis for simplicity. Suppose AC has length 2a, so O is at (a,0). Since O is midpoint of AC. Now, since ABCD is a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other. So the diagonals AC and BD intersect at O. Wait, but in this case, MN intersects AC at O. Wait, but according to the predicates, O is the midpoint of AC, so O is the intersection of diagonals. But MN is another line connecting M on AB and N on CD. So MN passes through O, the midpoint of AC. Also, AM = CN.

Since AM = CN, and O is the midpoint of AC, maybe triangles AMO and CNO are congruent via SAS? Because AM = CN, AO = CO (since O is midpoint), and angle between them? Wait, angle at O? Are the angles at O equal? Well, since MN is a straight line passing through O, so angles formed at O would be vertical angles? Wait, but if lines AM and CN are connected to O, then maybe triangles AMO and CNO share the same angle at O? Hmm, but how do we know that the angles at O are equal? Unless MN is symmetrical with respect to AC.

Alternatively, since AM = CN and AO = CO, and if the lines MO and NO form some symmetry. Alternatively, since the rhombus has AB parallel to CD, and AM is on AB, CN is on CD. Since AB || CD, then vectorially, AM and CN are in directions that are aligned. Maybe there's some reflection symmetry here.

Also, given that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular. Wait, but in this problem, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. But MN intersects AC at O. However, MN isn't necessarily a diagonal. But since O is midpoint of AC, and given that AM=CN, maybe MN is constructed such that O is midpoint.

Now, considering triangles AMO and CNO. Given that AM = CN, AO = CO, and angle AOM equals angle CON (vertically opposite angles). Therefore, by SAS, triangles AMO and CNO are congruent. Hence, OM = ON, and angles at O are equal. Therefore, MN is bisected by AC at O, making O the midpoint of MN as well? Wait, but O is already the midpoint of AC. Not sure yet.

But moving on. The problem asks for angle OBC. Let me consider triangle OBC. To find angle OBC, I need to relate it to known angles. Since ABCD is a rhombus, BC is congruent to AB, etc. Also, diagonals bisect the angles. Let me recall that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. So for example, diagonal AC bisects angle BAD and angle BCD. Similarly, BD bisects angles ABC and ADC.

But angle DAC is given as 28 degrees. Since angle DAC is part of angle BAD. So angle BAD is twice angle DAC, so 56 degrees. Therefore, angle ABC is supplementary to angle BAD, so 180 - 56 = 124 degrees. Then, since diagonal BD bisects angle ABC, each half is 62 degrees. Wait, but angle OBC is part of angle ABC. So if we can find the relationship between O and BD, maybe?

Wait, but O is the midpoint of AC, not BD. However, in a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other. So O is the intersection point of diagonals. But in this problem, O is the intersection of AC and MN. However, since MN is constructed such that AM = CN and O is midpoint of AC, does that imply that MN is actually the other diagonal? No, because MN connects M on AB and N on CD. Wait, but if AM = CN, and O is the midpoint, then maybe MN is parallel to BD? Or something like that?

Alternatively, since AM = CN and O is midpoint of AC, then maybe triangles AMO and CNO are congruent, leading to OM = ON. Thus, O is midpoint of MN as well. So MN is bisected by AC at its midpoint. Therefore, MN is a line segment whose midpoint is O, the midpoint of AC. So MN is such that it's symmetric with respect to AC. 

Now, considering that ABCD is a rhombus, so AB is congruent to AD. Let me try to use coordinates again. Let me set coordinates with A at (0,0), and since angle DAC is 28 degrees, and AC is a diagonal. Let me assume AC is horizontal for simplicity. Let me define AC as lying along x-axis, with O at origin? Wait, earlier thought was O is midpoint of AC. Let me adjust. Let me take AC as x-axis, with midpoint O at (0,0). Then, A is (-a, 0), C is (a, 0). Then, since ABCD is a rhombus, points B and D are located such that AB = AD = BC = CD. 

In a rhombus, diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but in general, diagonals bisect each other but aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Yes, that's a property. So diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. Therefore, BD is vertical in my coordinate system where AC is horizontal. 

So point B is somewhere above the x-axis, and point D is below. Coordinates of B and D would be (0,b) and (0,-b)? Wait, no. Wait, if diagonals bisect each other, then midpoint of BD is O (origin). So if O is midpoint of AC and BD, then coordinates of B and D would be such that their midpoint is (0,0). Let me suppose B is (p,q) and D is (-p,-q). Then, since AB is congruent to AD. Vector AB is from A(-a,0) to B(p,q): (p + a, q). Vector AD is from A(-a,0) to D(-p,-q): (-p +a, -q). Their magnitudes should be equal. So sqrt[(p+a)^2 + q^2] = sqrt[(-p +a)^2 + (-q)^2], which simplifies to (p+a)^2 + q^2 = (a-p)^2 + q^2 → expanding gives p² + 2ap + a² + q² = a² - 2ap + p² + q² → 4ap = 0 → p = 0. Therefore, B and D lie on y-axis. So B is (0, b) and D is (0, -b). 

Therefore, in this coordinate system, points are:
A(-a, 0)
C(a, 0)
B(0, b)
D(0, -b)

Then, angle DAC is the angle at A between DA and AC. Vector DA is from A to D: (0 - (-a), -b - 0) = (a, -b). Vector AC is from A to C: (a - (-a), 0 - 0) = (2a, 0). The angle between DA and AC is given as 28 degrees. Let me compute this angle using dot product.

Vector DA is (a, -b), vector AC is (2a, 0). The angle θ between them satisfies cosθ = (DA · AC)/(|DA| |AC|).

Compute DA · AC = a*2a + (-b)*0 = 2a².

|DA| = sqrt(a² + b²)
|AC| = 2a

Thus, cosθ = 2a² / [sqrt(a² + b²) * 2a] ] = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Given θ = 28 degrees, so:

cos(28°) = a / sqrt(a² + b²)

Square both sides:

cos²(28°) = a² / (a² + b²)
=> a² + b² = a² / cos²(28°)
=> b² = a² (1 / cos²(28°) - 1 ) 
=> b² = a² tan²(28°)
=> b = a tan(28°)

So, the ratio of b/a is tan(28°). Let's keep that in mind.

Now, points M and N are on AB and CD respectively, with AM = CN. Let's find coordinates of M and N.

First, parametrize AB. Point A is (-a, 0), point B is (0, b). So AB goes from (-a, 0) to (0, b). Let me parameterize M as a point on AB such that AM = k. The total length of AB is sqrt(a² + b²). But since AM = CN, and CN is a length on CD. Let me instead express coordinates of M and N.

Parametrize AB: starting at A(-a, 0), direction vector is (a, b). Let me let t be the fraction from A to B. So coordinates of M would be A + t*(AB vector):

x-coordinate: -a + t*a
y-coordinate: 0 + t*b

Similarly, point N is on CD. CD goes from C(a, 0) to D(0, -b). Direction vector is (-a, -b). Let me let s be the fraction from C to D. So coordinates of N would be C + s*(-a, -b):

x-coordinate: a - s*a
y-coordinate: 0 - s*b

Given that AM = CN. Let's compute AM and CN in terms of t and s. Since AM is the distance from A to M, which is t times AB's length. Similarly, CN is s times CD's length. Since AB = CD (as sides of rhombus), then AM = CN implies t = s.

So, t = s. Therefore, coordinates of M: (-a + ta, tb) = ( -a(1 - t), tb )

Coordinates of N: (a - sa, -sb) = (a(1 - s), -sb ). Since s = t, this becomes (a(1 - t), -tb )

Now, line MN connects points M(-a(1-t), tb) and N(a(1-t), -tb). Let me write equation of line MN.

The coordinates of M and N are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let me check:

For x-coordinates: M_x = -a(1 - t), N_x = a(1 - t). So symmetric across y-axis. Y-coordinates: M_y = tb, N_y = -tb. So line MN is symmetric over y-axis. Therefore, the line MN is symmetric with respect to y-axis. Hence, its equation is y = m(x) where it crosses the y-axis. Wait, but since it's symmetric, the midpoint of MN is on y-axis. The midpoint of MN would be ((-a(1-t) + a(1-t))/2 , (tb - tb)/2 ) = (0, 0). Wait, that's the origin, which is point O. So O is the midpoint of MN as well. Therefore, line MN passes through O(0,0), which is the midpoint of AC. 

So, since O is the midpoint of AC and MN, and O is (0,0). Now, we need to connect BO. Point B is (0, b). So BO is the line from (0, b) to (0, 0), which is the vertical line along y-axis. Wait, but in our coordinate system, BD is along y-axis. So BO is part of BD. Therefore, angle OBC is the angle between BO (which is along BD) and BC.

Wait, point C is (a, 0). So BC is from B(0, b) to C(a, 0). So angle OBC is the angle at point B between points O and C. Since O is (0,0), so angle between BO (from B to O) and BC (from B to C).

So, to find angle OBC, we can compute the angle between vectors BO and BC.

Vector BO is from B to O: O - B = (0 - 0, 0 - b) = (0, -b)

Vector BC is from B to C: C - B = (a - 0, 0 - b) = (a, -b)

So angle between BO (vector (0, -b)) and BC (vector (a, -b)).

The angle between these two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (BO · BC) / (|BO| |BC|)

Compute BO · BC = (0)(a) + (-b)(-b) = b²

|BO| = sqrt(0² + (-b)^2) = b

|BC| = sqrt(a² + b²)

Thus,

cos(theta) = b² / [b * sqrt(a² + b²)] ) = b / sqrt(a² + b²)

Earlier, we had from angle DAC: cos(28°) = a / sqrt(a² + b²). Let me call this value cos(28°) = a / sqrt(a² + b²). Therefore, b / sqrt(a² + b²) = sin(28°), since cos²θ + sin²θ = 1. So cos(theta) = sin(28°) = cos(90° - 28°) = cos(62°). Therefore, theta = 62 degrees. Therefore, angle OBC is 62 degrees. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option C is 62°, so the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me verify once more. Since angle between BO and BC is theta where cos(theta) = sin(28°). Since sin(28°) = cos(62°), so theta is 62°, yes. Therefore, angle OBC is 62 degrees. So the answer is C.
