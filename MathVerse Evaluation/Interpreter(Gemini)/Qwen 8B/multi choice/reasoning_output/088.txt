MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have points A, B, and C on a circle with center O. The angles given are angle ABO is 22 degrees and angle ACO is 42 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle BOC.

First, I remember that when points lie on a circle, there are some theorems about angles subtended by the same arc. Also, since O is the center, OA, OB, and OC are radii of the circle. That means OA = OB = OC because all radii of a circle are equal. 

Looking at the given information, angles ABO and ACO are given. Let me visualize triangle ABO and triangle ACO. Since OA and OB are radii, triangle ABO is isosceles with OA = OB. Similarly, triangle ACO is also isosceles with OA = OC. 

In triangle ABO, angle at B is 22 degrees. Wait, angle ABO is at point B, so that would mean in triangle ABO, the base angles at A and O? Wait, maybe I should clarify. In triangle ABO, the vertices are A, B, O. The angle at B is given as 22 degrees. But since OA and OB are radii, OA = OB, making triangle ABO isosceles with legs OA and OB. Therefore, the base angles at A and B should be equal? Wait, no. Wait, the two equal sides are OA and OB, so the base is AB, and the apex is at O. Wait, but the angle at B is one of the base angles?

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. If OA and OB are equal, then the triangle ABO has two equal sides: OA and OB. Therefore, the angles opposite those sides would be equal. Wait, OA is opposite angle B, and OB is opposite angle A. Wait, no. In triangle ABO, side OA is opposite angle B, side OB is opposite angle A, and side AB is opposite angle O. So if OA equals OB, then the angles opposite them, which are angles at B and A respectively, should be equal. Therefore, angle at B (angle ABO) equals angle at A (angle BAO). But wait, the given angle ABO is 22 degrees. So angle BAO is also 22 degrees. Then the third angle at O in triangle ABO would be 180 - 2*22 = 136 degrees. So angle AOB is 136 degrees?

Similarly, for triangle ACO, which is also isosceles with OA = OC. The given angle is angle ACO, which is at point C. So angle ACO is 42 degrees. Therefore, angle at C (angle ACO) equals angle at A (angle CAO)? Wait, similar logic applies here. In triangle ACO, OA = OC, so angles opposite those sides are equal. OA is opposite angle C (angle ACO), and OC is opposite angle A (angle CAO). Therefore, angle ACO equals angle CAO. Hence, angle CAO is 42 degrees. Then the third angle at O in triangle ACO is 180 - 2*42 = 96 degrees. So angle AOC is 96 degrees.

Now, angle BOC is the angle at the center O between points B and C. To find angle BOC, perhaps we can consider the sum of angles around point O. Wait, but how do these angles relate? Because the total around point O is 360 degrees. However, the angles we found are angle AOB (from triangle ABO) and angle AOC (from triangle ACO). But angle BOC is part of the full circle. Wait, maybe angle BOC is the difference between angles AOC and AOB, depending on the position of points. Alternatively, perhaps considering the arcs they subtend.

Alternatively, since OA, OB, and OC are radii, the central angles corresponding to arcs AB, BC, and AC can be connected to the angles at the center. But maybe another approach is better.

Let me think again. The angle at the center (BOC) relates to the arc BC. Also, the angles at A (angles BAO and CAO) are related to the inscribed angles over arcs BC and something else?

Wait, angle BAO is an inscribed angle? Wait, point A is on the circumference, so angle BAO is formed by points B-A-O. Hmm, but O is the center. So angle BAO is an angle at point A between BA and AO. Since AO is a radius, and BA is a chord. Maybe it's an inscribed angle over arc BO? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of the central angles around point O is 360 degrees. So if we can find angles AOB, AOC, and then maybe angle BOC is the difference between them or something like that.

Earlier, we found that angle AOB is 136 degrees and angle AOC is 96 degrees. Wait, but how does that relate to angle BOC?

Wait, suppose points A, B, and C are arranged on the circle such that moving from A to B to C. Then the central angles would be AOB, BOC, and COA. But unless we know the order, it's hard to tell. However, since angles at A (BAO and CAO) are 22 and 42 degrees respectively, maybe we can find the total angle at A?

Wait, the total angle at point A between BA and CA would be angle BAC. Which is angle BAO + angle CAO = 22 + 42 = 64 degrees. But angle BAC is an inscribed angle that subtends arc BC. Therefore, the measure of arc BC is twice that, which is 128 degrees. Therefore, the central angle BOC, which subtends the same arc BC, would be equal to the measure of arc BC, so 128 degrees. Therefore, angle BOC is 128 degrees. That would make the answer A.

But wait, let me check again. Inscribed angle theorem says that an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc. So angle BAC is an inscribed angle subtending arc BC. Therefore, arc BC measures 2 * angle BAC = 2 * 64 = 128 degrees. Therefore, the central angle BOC, which is the central angle subtending arc BC, is equal to the measure of arc BC, which is 128 degrees. Thus, angle BOC is 128 degrees, which corresponds to answer choice A.

But let me verify this with another approach. Earlier, I thought angle AOB was 136 degrees and angle AOC was 96 degrees. If we add those together, 136 + 96 = 232 degrees. But that's the sum of angles AOB and AOC. If angle BOC is the remaining part of the circle, then 360 - 232 = 128 degrees. So that gives angle BOC as 128 degrees again. This confirms the earlier conclusion.

Therefore, the answer should be A: 128 degrees.
