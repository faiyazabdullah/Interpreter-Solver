MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two parallel lines AB and CD being intercepted by another line EF. That means EF is a transversal cutting across AB and CD. The given angle 1 is 100 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 2. 

First, I remember that when a transversal intersects two parallel lines, there are several angle relationships. Like corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Wait, but I need to recall exactly which angles are which here.

So, since AB is parallel to CD, and EF is the transversal, the angles formed should follow those rules. Let me visualize this. Let's say AB and CD are horizontal lines, and EF is a slanting line crossing them. Angle 1 is given as 100 degrees. Depending on where angle 1 is located, it could be either on the upper side or lower side of the transversal. But maybe the diagram shows angle 1 as one of the angles formed at the intersection of EF with AB or CD.

Wait, the problem mentions that angle 1 is 100 degrees. Since AB and CD are parallel, if angle 1 is on one side of the transversal, then the corresponding angle on the other line would be equal. Or if they're alternate interior angles, they'd also be equal. However, if angle 1 is a same-side interior angle, then it would add up with another angle to 180 degrees.

But without seeing the diagram, I need to rely on standard configurations. Typically, in such problems, angle 1 and angle 2 are likely to be either corresponding or alternate interior angles. But sometimes they might be consecutive interior angles. Let me think about the possibilities.

Assume angle 1 is formed at the intersection of EF and AB. Then, depending on its position, angle 2 might be on the other line CD. For example, if angle 1 is an exterior angle on one side, then angle 2 could be an interior angle. Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are consecutive interior angles? In that case, they would be supplementary. But if angle 1 is 100 degrees, then angle 2 would be 80 degrees because 100 + 80 = 180. Alternatively, if they are vertical angles or corresponding, they would be equal. But since the answer options include 80, which is 180-100, that seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an alternate interior angle with another angle, making angle 2 equal to it. Wait, but the problem states that angle 1 is 100 degrees. If angle 2 is a corresponding angle, then it would also be 100 degrees. But that's option D. However, if angle 2 is a consecutive interior angle, then it would be supplementary, so 80 degrees, which is option C. 

Hmm, but how do I know which one it is? Let me check again. The problem says that lines AB and CD are intercepted by line EF. So EF crosses AB and CD, creating eight angles. The angles formed at each intersection. Now, angle 1 is given as 100 degrees. Depending on where angle 1 is, angle 2 could be different.

Another way: if angle 1 is on one side of the transversal, like at the intersection with AB, then angle 2 could be on the other line CD. Let me think of the standard cases. Suppose EF intersects AB at point G and CD at point H. Then, angle 1 could be at G, and angle 2 at H. If angle 1 is a same-side interior angle with angle 2, then they sum to 180. So 100 + angle 2 = 180 → angle 2 = 80. Which is option C. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 2 are vertical angles or corresponding, then they would be equal. But since angle 1 is 100, angle 2 would also be 100. But that's option D. But why would angle 2 be 100? Unless there's some other relationship.

Wait, but in typical problems like this, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle 1 is one of them, angle 2 would be 80. Therefore, the answer would be C. But wait, the options are A:10°, B:50°, C:80°, D:100°. So 80 is option C. But maybe I'm missing something?

Wait, but perhaps angle 1 is an exterior angle. For instance, if angle 1 is an exterior angle on the top side, then the corresponding angle on the bottom would be equal. But if angle 2 is an alternate interior angle, then it would be equal to angle 1. Wait, but that would make angle 2 also 100. But that's option D. So which is it?

I need to clarify the positions. Without the diagram, it's a bit ambiguous. But usually, in these problems, angle 1 and angle 2 are considered as consecutive interior angles. Let me think again. If AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, then the consecutive interior angles (also called same-side interior angles) are supplementary. So if angle 1 is one of them, then angle 2 would be 180-100=80. Hence, answer C. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle, then angle 2 would be equal to angle 1. But then angle 2 would be 100. So why isn't that the case? Maybe angle 2 is a different type of angle. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 is an exterior angle, and angle 2 is an interior angle. Let me consider that. For example, suppose EF intersects AB at point G, forming angle 1 at G. Then, if angle 1 is an exterior angle, then the corresponding interior angle on CD would be equal. But angle 2 could be that corresponding angle. Wait, but if angle 1 is an exterior angle, then the adjacent interior angle would be supplementary to it. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is a vertical angle with another angle, leading to different relations. This is getting confusing without the diagram. 

But in many standard problems, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, and one of the angles is given, the common setup is that the angle is an exterior angle, and the other is an interior angle. For example, if angle 1 is outside the parallel lines, then angle 2 could be inside. But then, the relationship depends on their positions. 

Wait, here's a thought: if angle 1 is on one side of the transversal, then the angle opposite to it (vertical angle) would be equal. But if angle 2 is the corresponding angle on the other line, then they would be equal. But if angle 1 is on one line, and angle 2 is on the other, but in a different position. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary. For instance, if they are consecutive interior angles. Given that AB is parallel to CD, then yes, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle 1 is 100, angle 2 would be 80. Thus, answer C. 

Given that, I think the answer is C. Option C is 80 degrees.
