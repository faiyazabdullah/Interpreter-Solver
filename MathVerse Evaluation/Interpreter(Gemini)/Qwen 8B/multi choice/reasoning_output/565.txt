QUESTION:
g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function going through (0,-2), (-1,0), (2,0), (3,4), (-2,4). f(x)=x^2+x-6. How many roots do the functions have in common?

CHOICES:
A:$f$ and $g$ share the same root(s).
B:$f$ and $g$ share one root in common but each have another root that is not shared.
C:$f$ and $g$ share no roots in common.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find how many roots the functions f(x) = x² + x - 6 and g(x) have in common. The given points for g(x) are (0,-2), (-1,0), (2,0), (3,4), and (-2,4). Also, it's mentioned that g(x) is a quadratic function. 

First, since both f(x) and g(x) are quadratic functions, they can each have up to two real roots. But the question is about their common roots. To find common roots, I should first find the roots of both functions and see where they overlap.

Starting with f(x) = x² + x - 6. Let me factor this equation if possible. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -6 and add up to 1. Hmm, factors of -6 could be 3 and -2 because 3 * (-2) = -6 and 3 + (-2) = 1. So, factoring gives (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0. Therefore, the roots are x = -3 and x = 2. Wait, let me check that again. Expanding (x+3)(x-2) would be x² + x -6. Yes, that's correct. So f(x) has roots at x=-3 and x=2.

Now, for g(x). Since it's a quadratic, it can be written in the form g(x) = ax² + bx + c. We know that g(x) passes through several points. Let's use those points to find the equation of g(x). However, since there are five points given, but a quadratic is determined uniquely by three non-collinear points. Wait, but maybe some of these points are roots? For example, the points (-1,0) and (2,0) lie on the graph of g(x), so that suggests that x = -1 and x = 2 are roots of g(x). Because when y=0, those are the x-intercepts. Therefore, if g(x) has roots at x=-1 and x=2, then its equation can be expressed as g(x) = k(x + 1)(x - 2), where k is a constant. 

But wait, let me verify this. Let's plug in the other points to find k. For instance, take the point (0, -2). Plugging x=0 into g(x): g(0) = k(0 +1)(0 -2) = k*(1)*(-2) = -2k. According to the given point, g(0) is -2. So -2k = -2 → k = 1. Therefore, the equation of g(x) is (x +1)(x -2) = x² - x - 2. Wait, but hold on. Let me check another point to confirm. Take the point (3,4). Plugging x=3 into the equation: (3 +1)(3 -2) = 4*1 = 4. Which matches the y-value 4. Similarly, check (-2,4): plugging x=-2: (-2 +1)(-2 -2) = (-1)(-4) = 4. That also matches. So yes, g(x) = x² - x - 2. Wait, but hold on. Wait, the original f(x) was x² + x -6. Comparing with g(x) here, which is x² -x -2. So their equations are different. Now, the roots of g(x) would be found by setting g(x)=0: x² -x -2 =0. Solving this quadratic equation: discriminant D = b² -4ac = 1 +8 =9. So sqrt(9)=3. Thus, x=(1 ±3)/2 → x=(4)/2=2 and x=(-2)/2=-1. So roots at x=2 and x=-1. 

Wait, so f(x) has roots at x=-3 and x=2, while g(x) has roots at x=-1 and x=2. Therefore, the common root is x=2. So they share one common root. But wait, looking back at the answer choices, option B says they share one root in common but each have another root not shared. Option A says they share the same roots, which would require both roots to be same, but here they have one in common. So answer B. 

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation for g(x). Wait, earlier I thought that the equation for g(x) is x² -x -2. But according to the given points, like (3,4): substituting x=3 into x² -x -2 gives 9 -3 -2 =4, which matches. Similarly, (-2,4): 4 - (-2) -2 = 4 +2 -2 =4, correct. And (0,-2): 0 -0 -2 =-2, correct. So that seems correct. Then why does the problem mention that g(x) is a quadratic function going through those points. So the conclusion is that the roots of f(x) are -3 and 2, and roots of g(x) are -1 and 2. Hence, only x=2 is a common root. Therefore, the answer is B. 

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miscalculate the roots of f(x). f(x)=x² +x -6. Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac)]/(2a). Here a=1, b=1, c=-6. So discriminant is 1 +24=25. sqrt(25)=5. So x=(-1 ±5)/2. So x=(4)/2=2 and x=(-6)/2=-3. Correct. So roots are indeed 2 and -3. 

Therefore, common root is 2. So answer B. So the answer is B.
