MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have points A, B, and C. Lines a and b are mentioned, and there's a statement that a is parallel to b. Then there's a triangle ABC, with a right angle at point A because of the RightAngle predicate. Also, Angle(B,A,C) is a right angle, so that means angle at A is 90 degrees. Wait, but the problem says the right-angled vertex is placed on line a. Hmm, maybe I need to visualize this better.

Wait, the problem mentions that a triangular plate has its right-angled vertex on line a. So, the triangle ABC is right-angled at A, and point A lies on line a. Also, lines a and b are parallel. There's an angle 1 measuring 42 degrees. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Since lines a and b are parallel, and point A is on line a. Maybe there's another line involved here? The problem also mentions angle 1 being 42 degrees. The sum of angles in triangle ABC should be 180 degrees. Given that one angle is 90 degrees (the right angle), and another angle is 42 degrees, then the third angle would be 180 - 90 - 42 = 48 degrees. But wait, the question asks about angle 2, which is said to be equal to angle 3. 

Wait, looking back at the predicates: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C))) equals 180. Since Angle(B,A,C) is the right angle, which is 90 degrees. Angle(1) is 42 degrees. Therefore, Angle(3) must be 180 - 90 - 42 = 48 degrees. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))) implies that angle 2 is also 48 degrees. So the answer would be 48°, which corresponds to choice B.

But wait, let me check if there's more to it. Are there any other factors due to the parallel lines? For example, maybe some alternate interior angles or something? Because lines a and b are parallel, and perhaps there's a transversal creating certain angles. However, since the triangle's right angle is on line a, and if line b is parallel to a, maybe there's a way that angle 1 relates to angle 2 via the parallel lines. But according to the given predicates, angle 1 is already given as 42°, and angle 3 is determined as 48°, making angle 2 equal to angle 3. So unless there's another relationship I'm missing, the answer should be 48°, which is option B.

I think that's it. The key was recognizing that the triangle's angles sum to 180, with two known angles (right angle and 42°), leading to the third angle being 48°, and angle 2 being equal to that.
