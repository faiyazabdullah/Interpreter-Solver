MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find how many roots the functions f(x) and g(x) have in common. The question mentions that g(x) is a quadratic function opening upward and passes through the points (-3, 0) and (4, 0). Also, f(x) is given as x² + 4x. 

First, I should recall that the roots of a quadratic function are the x-values where the function equals zero. For f(x) = x² + 4x, setting it to zero gives x(x + 4) = 0, so the roots are at x = 0 and x = -4. Wait, but the problem says that g(x) has roots at -3 and 4 because the points (-3, 0) and (4, 0) lie on the line representing g(x). But wait, the problem states that g(x) is a quadratic function opening upward, so its general form would be something like a(x + 3)(x - 4) since those are the roots. Let me check the given predicates again.

Looking at the predicates provided: Equals(roots_g_x_-3,-3) and Equals(roots_g_x_4,4). That means the roots of g(x) are at x = -3 and x = 4. Therefore, the roots of g(x) are -3 and 4. Now, for f(x), the roots are found by solving x² + 4x = 0, which factors to x(x + 4) = 0, giving roots at x = 0 and x = -4. 

So comparing the roots of f(x) and g(x): f has roots at -4 and 0; g has roots at -3 and 4. None of these roots overlap. Therefore, they don't share any common roots. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something here? Let me double-check. 

Wait, the problem also mentions that g(x) is defined as (x + 3)(x - 4). Expanding that gives x² - x - 12. However, f(x) is x² + 4x. These two quadratics have different coefficients. The roots of g(x) are indeed -3 and 4, while the roots of f(x) are -4 and 0. There's no overlap between these roots. So, the answer should be C, that they share no roots in common. 

But hold on, let me confirm if there's any possibility that the equations could have overlapping roots. Suppose there was a case where one equation's root coincided with another's. Here, -4 vs -3, 0 vs 4—no matches. Hence, no common roots. Therefore, the correct answer is C.
