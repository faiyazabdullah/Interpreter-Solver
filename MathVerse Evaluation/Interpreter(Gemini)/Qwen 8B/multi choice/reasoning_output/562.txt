CHOICES:
A:Positivie
B:Zero
C:Negative

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a quadratic function g that opens upward, passes through the points (2,4) and (6,4), and has its vertex at (4,0). We need to determine if the discriminant of this quadratic is positive, zero, or negative. The answer choices are A (Positive), B (Zero), or C (Negative).

First, I remember that for a quadratic equation in standard form ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is b² - 4ac. The discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots. If it's positive, there are two distinct real roots; if zero, one real root (a repeated root); and if negative, no real roots. But how does this relate to the graph of the parabola?

Wait, the problem mentions the quadratic function g, so maybe I should think about the graph of this function. Since it's a parabola opening upwards, the coefficient 'a' must be positive. Also, the vertex is at (4,0), which means the minimum point of the parabola is at x=4, y=0. 

Given that the vertex is at (4,0), the quadratic can be written in vertex form: y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h,k) is the vertex. Here, h=4 and k=0, so the equation becomes y = a(x - 4)². Now, since the parabola passes through (2,4), substituting x=2 and y=4 into the equation should give us the value of 'a'.

Let me do that substitution. Plugging in x=2, y=4:

4 = a(2 - 4)²  
4 = a(-2)²  
4 = a*4  
So, a = 4 / 4 = 1. Therefore, the equation is y = (x - 4)². Let me check another point to confirm. For x=6, plugging in gives y=(6-4)^2 = 4, which matches the given point (6,4). That checks out.

Now, expanding this equation to standard form to find the coefficients for the discriminant. Expanding y = (x - 4)²:

y = x² - 8x + 16. 

In standard form, that's y = x² -8x +16. Comparing to ax² + bx + c, here a=1, b=-8, c=16. Then the discriminant would be b² -4ac = (-8)^2 -4*(1)*(16) = 64 - 64 = 0. 

Wait, so the discriminant is zero? That would mean the quadratic has exactly one real root, which makes sense because the parabola touches the x-axis at its vertex (4,0). Since the vertex is on the x-axis, the equation has a repeated root at x=4. Hence, the discriminant is zero. 

But wait, the question says "the discriminant of f". Wait, but in the problem statement, the quadratic is called g, not f. Wait, looking back at the original problem: the user mentioned "Quadratic function g opens upward..." and then asks about the discriminant of f. Hmm, perhaps that's a typo? Or maybe there was confusion in variable names. Wait, checking again:

Original problem says: "Is the discriminant of f positive, zero, or negative?" But the quadratic discussed is called g. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem setup, but assuming that f refers to the same quadratic as g. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mix-up. However, given the context, it's likely that the intended quadratic is g, so we can proceed under that assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem had a typo, and they meant discriminant of g. Assuming that, then our calculation shows discriminant is zero. So the answer would be B: Zero.

Another way to think: since the vertex is on the x-axis, the quadratic touches the x-axis at exactly one point, implying that the quadratic has a double root there. Thus, the discriminant must be zero. This aligns with our earlier calculation. Therefore, the discriminant is zero, so the answer is B.
