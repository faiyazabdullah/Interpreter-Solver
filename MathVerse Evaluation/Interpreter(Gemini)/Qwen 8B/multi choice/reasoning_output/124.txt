MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about forming a cone from a sector of a circle. The given information includes a circle with radius 1.0 and a sector with a central angle of 90 degrees. We need to find the radius of the sector. Wait, actually, wait—the wording says "the radius of the sector is ()". Hmm, maybe I need to clarify what exactly is being asked here. 

First, let me recall how cones are formed from sectors. When you take a sector of a circle and roll it into a cone, the radius of the original sector becomes the slant height of the cone. Also, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. 

So, the problem gives us the radius of the circle (which is the same as the radius of the sector, since the sector is part of the circle). Wait, but the circle's radius is given as 1.0. But the sector's radius—wait, isn't that the same as the circle's radius? Or is there confusion here?

Wait, hold on. Let me parse the problem again carefully. The user mentions cutting a circle and a sector piece of paper. Wait, perhaps they mean two separate pieces? Wait, the question says: "cut a circle and a sector piece of paper on the paper so that it can form a cone model." Maybe that's a translation issue. Perhaps the sector is part of the circle? Or maybe the circle is used to make the sector? 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that we have a sector with central angle 90 degrees, and when rolled into a cone, we need to find its radius. Wait, but the problem states that the radius of the circle is 1.0. So the sector is part of a circle with radius 1.0. Therefore, the radius of the sector (as a sector) would be the same as the radius of the original circle, which is 1.0. But that seems too straightforward. However, the answer choices don't include 1.0, so there's probably something wrong with my understanding.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me re-read the problem statement.

"If the radius of the circle is 1.0 and the central angle of the sector is equal to 90.0, then the radius of the sector is ()" 

Wait, the wording is confusing. Is the circle's radius 1.0, and the sector has a central angle of 90 degrees. Then, when you form a cone from the sector, what is the radius of the sector? Or is it asking for the radius of the base of the cone? Because if the sector is part of the circle, then the radius of the sector (as a sector) is the same as the radius of the circle. But that doesn't fit the answer options. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the radius of the base of the cone?

Wait, perhaps the problem is mistranslated or misphrased. Let me think again. When you create a cone from a sector, the radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. 

Given that the central angle of the sector is 90 degrees (which is π/2 radians), and the radius of the original circle (which is the same as the radius of the sector) is 1.0. So, the arc length of the sector is θ*r = (π/2)*1 = π/2. This arc length equals the circumference of the base of the cone, which is 2πR, where R is the radius of the base of the cone. 

Therefore, π/2 = 2πR → R = 1/4. But the question asks for the radius of the sector. Wait, but the sector's radius is already given as 1.0. That contradicts the answer choices. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the problem is not about the sector's radius but the radius of the base of the cone? But the answer choices are numbers like 2, 4, etc. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that the circle has radius 1.0, and the sector is created from this circle. Then, when forming the cone, the radius of the sector (original radius) is 1.0, but the question is asking for something else. Wait, perhaps the problem is in Chinese and translated incorrectly. For example, maybe it's asking for the radius of the base of the cone, which would be R = 1/4, but none of the answer choices match that. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the slant height, which is the original radius, 1.0, but again that's not among the choices. 

Alternatively, could there be a mistake in interpreting the problem? Let me consider another possibility. Suppose the problem is that you have a sector with central angle 90 degrees, and when you form a cone, the radius of the base of the cone is given, and you need to find the radius of the sector? But the problem states that the radius of the circle is 1.0. Wait, the circle's radius is the same as the sector's radius. So if the sector comes from a circle of radius 1.0, then the sector's radius is 1.0. 

But since the answer choices do not include 1.0, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the base of the cone? Let me recast the problem. 

Let me define variables properly. Let’s denote:

- Let r_sector be the radius of the original sector (which is the same as the radius of the circle it came from).
- Central angle of the sector is θ = 90° = π/2 radians.
- Arc length of the sector is s = θ * r_sector.
- When forming a cone, the arc length becomes the circumference of the base of the cone: s = 2πR, where R is the radius of the base of the cone.
- The slant height l of the cone is equal to the radius of the sector: l = r_sector.
- The radius of the base of the cone R can be found from s = 2πR → R = s/(2π) = (θ * r_sector)/(2π).

Now, suppose the problem is asking for the radius of the sector, which is r_sector. But the problem states that the radius of the circle is 1.0. Hence, r_sector = 1.0. But 1.0 is not one of the answer choices. So this suggests that either the problem is different, or there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the radius of the base of the cone? Let me see. Given that the central angle is 90°, and the radius of the circle (sector) is 1.0, then R = (θ / 2π) * r_sector = (π/2 / 2π) * 1 = 1/4. Still, 1/4 isn't among the answer choices. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the radius of the original circle, which is 1.0, but the answer options are incorrect? Or perhaps the problem is not about the base radius but about something else. 

Wait, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user included some predicates involving points, squares, angles, circles, sectors, etc. Let me try to parse those. The given predicates include Square(A,B,C,D), MeasureOf(Angle(A)) = 90.0, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) = 1.0, Circle(O), RadiusOf(Line(O,X), Circle(O)) = 1.0, Sector(A,E,F), MeasureOf(Angle(E,A,F)) = 90.0, RightAngle(Angle(A)). 

Hmm, these seem to describe a square ABCD with each side length 1.0, and a circle O with radius 1.0. There's also a sector AEF with central angle 90 degrees. Wait, but how does this relate to forming a cone? Maybe the sector is part of the circle O, which has radius 1.0, and the sector's central angle is 90 degrees. Then, when forming a cone, the radius of the sector (which is the same as the circle's radius) is 1.0. But again, answer choices don't include 1.0. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the base of the cone, which we calculated earlier as 1/4, but that still doesn't match the answer choices. 

Wait, maybe the problem is reversed. Suppose the sector is formed from a circle with radius R, and when made into a cone, the resulting cone has certain properties. But the problem states that the radius of the circle is 1.0. Let me think again. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the radius of the base of the cone, but there's more to it. Let me try plugging in the answer choices. 

Suppose the answer is 2. Let's assume that the radius of the base of the cone is 2. Then, the circumference would be 2*π*2=4π. The arc length of the sector is θ*r_sector. Since θ is 90 degrees (π/2 radians), and r_sector is given as 1.0, then arc length is π/2 * 1 = π/2. But π/2 ≠ 4π. So this doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, if the answer is 4, then circumference is 2π*4=8π. Again, arc length is π/2, which doesn't match. 

Wait, maybe there's confusion between the radius of the sector and the radius of the base. Let me try again. 

When you make a cone from a sector, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. The radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. 

So, given that the central angle is 90 degrees, which is π/2 radians, and the radius of the sector is r_sector. 

Arc length = θ * r_sector = π/2 * r_sector. 

This arc length equals the circumference of the base of the cone: 2πR. 

So, π/2 * r_sector = 2πR ⇒ R = r_sector /4. 

But if the problem is asking for R (radius of base of cone), then R = r_sector /4. However, the problem states that the radius of the circle (which is r_sector) is 1.0. Hence, R = 1.0 /4 = 0.25. Still not matching answer choices. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the radius of the original circle (which is r_sector)? But that's given as 1.0. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem setup. For instance, if the sector is not taken from a circle with radius 1.0, but instead, the circle has radius such that when you form the cone, the radius of the sector is determined? No, the problem says the radius of the circle is 1.0. 

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the radius of the sector in terms of the cone's dimensions? Or perhaps the problem is not well-translated, and "radius of the sector" refers to something else. 

Wait, the term "radius of the sector" is ambiguous. In standard terminology, a sector has a radius, which is the same as the radius of the circle it's part of. So if the circle has radius 1.0, then the sector's radius is 1.0. 

But since the answer choices don't include 1.0, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the problem is asking for the radius of the base of the cone, which we found as 0.25, but that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe the problem involves combining two sectors or something else. 

Wait, looking back at the given predicates, there's a square with sides of length 1.0. Could that be relevant? For example, if the square is folded into a cone? Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves creating a cone from the square? No, the question specifically mentions a circle and a sector. 

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's translation. For example, maybe it should say that the radius of the base of the cone is 1.0, and the central angle is 90 degrees, then find the radius of the sector. Let's try that. 

Assume that the radius of the base of the cone is 1.0. Then the circumference is 2π*1.0 = 2π. This equals the arc length of the sector, which is θ * r_sector. Given θ is 90 degrees (π/2 radians), so:

π/2 * r_sector = 2π ⇒ r_sector = 4. 

Ah! Now, the answer would be 4, which is option B. 

This suggests that the problem may have been mistranslated or misworded. It likely intended to ask for the radius of the sector (original circle) given that the base radius of the cone is 1.0 and the central angle is 90 degrees. 

In that case, the calculation would be as follows:

Arc length of sector = circumference of base of cone  
θ * r_sector = 2πR  
Where θ = π/2 radians (since 90 degrees), and R = 1.0  
So:  
(π/2) * r_sector = 2π*1  
Divide both sides by π:  
(1/2) * r_sector = 2  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
r_sector = 4  

Thus, the radius of the sector (original circle) is 4.0, which corresponds to answer choice B. 

Therefore, despite the confusing wording, the correct answer is B.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the radius of the sector used to form a cone, we begin by analyzing the relationship between the sector and the cone it forms.

### Step 1: Understanding the Geometry

We are told:
- A **sector** of a **circle** with **central angle** $ \theta = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} $ radians.
- The **arc length** of this sector becomes the **circumference** of the **base** of the **cone**.
- The **radius of the circle**, i.e., the **slant height** of the cone, is denoted as $ r_{\text{sector}} $.
- The **radius of the base** of the cone is denoted as $ R $.

From this, we know:
$$
\text{Arc Length of Sector} = \theta \cdot r_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot r_{\text{sector}}
$$
Also,
$$
\text{Circumference of Base of Cone} = 2\pi R
$$

Equating the arc length to the circumference:
$$
\frac{\pi}{2} \cdot r_{\text{sector}} = 2\pi R
$$

---

### Step 2: Solving for the Sector Radius

Cancel out $ \pi $ from both sides:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \cdot r_{\text{sector}} = 2R
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:
$$
r_{\text{sector}} = 4R
$$

At this point, we're given that the **radius of the base of the cone** is **1.0** (implied from the problem’s structure and typical formulations). Substituting:
$$
r_{\text{sector}} = 4 \cdot 1.0 = 4
$$

---

### Final Verification

- The central angle of the sector is $ 90^\circ $, consistent with our use of $ \frac{\pi}{2} $.
- The arc length calculation aligns perfectly with the cone’s base circumference.
- The computed radius of the sector (originally the circle) is $ 4 $, which directly matches the answer choice.
