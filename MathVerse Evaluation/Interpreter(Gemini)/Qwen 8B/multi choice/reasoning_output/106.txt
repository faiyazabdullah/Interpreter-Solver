MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle ACB, given some information about points on a circle and certain angles. Let me start by recalling the given information and the theorems that might apply here.

First, the problem mentions that AB is the diameter of circle O. That means points A and B are at opposite ends of the circle, so the line segment AB passes through the center O. Also, there are points C and D on the circle. We know that angle AOD is 136 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle ACB. 

Wait, the question says angle ACB, but looking back at the given predicates, there's also a mention of angle ACD? Or maybe I misread. Let me check again. Oh, the last part says "Angle(A,C,B)" which would be angle ACB. So yes, we need to find angle ACB.

Now, since AB is the diameter, and C is another point on the circle, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with AB as the diameter. There's a theorem called Thales' theorem which states that if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. Wait, so angle ACB should be 90 degrees? But wait, that seems conflicting with the given angle AOD being 136 degrees. Maybe there's more to it here.

But hold on, the problem mentions angle AOD is 136 degrees. Point D is also on the circle, and OD is a radius. Since OA and OB are radii, and AB is the diameter, OA = OB = OC = OD. All those lines are radii. So OA, OB, OC, OD are all radii of the circle. Therefore, OA = OB = OC = OD. 

So angle AOD is formed by two radii, OA and OD. Since OA and OD are radii, the angle between them at the center O is 136 degrees. Now, how does this relate to angle ACB?

I think I need to use the concept of central angles versus inscribed angles. The central angle subtended by an arc is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. So if angle AOD is a central angle, then the corresponding inscribed angle over the same arc AD would be half of that. Wait, but angle ACB is not directly over arc AD. Let me visualize this.

Points A and B are endpoints of the diameter. Point C is somewhere on the circle, and point D is another point. Given that angle AOD is 136 degrees, so the arc AD measures 136 degrees because the central angle equals the measure of its arc. Then, the inscribed angle subtended by arc AD would be half of that, so 68 degrees. But how does that connect to angle ACB?

Alternatively, perhaps angle ACB relates to arcs involving points A, B, and C. Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. If we consider point C on the circle, then angle ACB is an inscribed angle that subtends arc AB. Wait, but according to Thales' theorem, angle ACB should be 90 degrees. However, that contradicts the presence of angle AOD being 136 degrees. Hmm, maybe there's something wrong with my understanding here.

Wait, maybe angle ACB isn't subtending arc AB. Let me think again. If points A, C, B are on the circle with AB as diameter, then angle ACB is indeed subtended by arc AB. Since AB is a diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees, so the inscribed angle ACB should be half of that, which is 90 degrees. But why is the problem giving us angle AOD? That suggests that there's more to the problem, and perhaps angle ACB isn't directly related to angle AOD. Wait, but maybe point D is involved in some way?

Looking back at the given predicates, there's a Line(O,C) and Line(O,D). So points C and D are both on the circle. The angle AOD is 136 degrees. Also, since OA, OB, OC, OD are all radii, each has length equal to the radius. So OA=OB=OC=OD. 

Perhaps angle AOD refers to the angle between OA and OD. Since OA and OD are radii, angle AOD is the central angle for arc AD. So arc AD measures 136 degrees. Then, the inscribed angle subtended by arc AD would be half of that, so 68 degrees. But how does that relate to angle ACB?

Wait, angle ACB is an inscribed angle. Let me see. Suppose we look at triangle ACD. But I don't know where point D is located. Alternatively, maybe angle ACB is related to other arcs. Let me try to draw this mentally.

Since AB is the diameter, points A and B are fixed. Points C and D are arbitrary on the circle except A and B. But angle AOD is given as 136 degrees. So point D is positioned such that when you connect O to D, the angle between OA and OD is 136 degrees. 

Let me consider the entire circle. Since OA is a radius pointing towards A, and angle AOD is 136 degrees, so OD is making a 136-degree angle with OA. Therefore, the position of D depends on the direction of OA. For example, if OA is along the positive x-axis, then OD would make an angle of 136 degrees from OA. Depending on the orientation, D could be in different positions. But since AB is the diameter, point B is diametrically opposite A. 

But how does this relate to angle ACB? Let me recall that angle ACB is an inscribed angle. The measure of angle ACB is half the measure of the arc that it subtends. Which arc? It subtends arc AB. Because angle at C, so it's subtended by arc AB. But arc AB is 180 degrees, so angle ACB should be 90 degrees. But that doesn't involve angle AOD. 

Hmm, but the problem gives angle AOD as 136 degrees. So maybe there's a mistake in my thinking. Perhaps angle ACB isn't subtended by arc AB? Wait, if C is not on the semicircle AB, but since AB is the diameter, any point C on the circle (not overlapping with A or B) lies on the semicircle. Wait, but even then, angle ACB should still be 90 degrees. Unless point C is on the opposite semicircle? No, regardless of where C is on the circle (as long as it's not A or B), angle ACB is always 90 degrees. 

But then why is angle AOD given as 136 degrees? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read the problem statement. 

The question says: "As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, C is the point on circle O (except A and B), angle AOD = 136.0, then the degree of angle C is ()". Wait, angle C is angle ACB. So angle ACB is supposed to be determined based on angle AOD. But according to Thales' theorem, angle ACB should be 90 degrees regardless of where C is. But that conflicts with the given angle AOD. 

Therefore, there must be something wrong with my assumptions. Maybe angle AOD is not referring to arc AD, but to something else. Wait, angle AOD is formed by points A, O, D. Since O is the center, OA and OD are radii. So angle AOD is indeed a central angle for arc AD. So arc AD measures 136 degrees. 

Then, if we consider triangle AOD, which is an isosceles triangle with OA=OD. The base angles at A and D would be (180-136)/2 = 22 degrees each. But how does that relate to angle ACB?

Alternatively, maybe angle ACB is related to arc AD. Wait, suppose we consider point C. If we can find the measure of arc AC or arc BC, then angle ACB would be half the difference of arcs... Wait, angle ACB is an inscribed angle that subtends arc AB, but if point C is not on the semicircle AB, but maybe there's another arc involved. 

Wait, perhaps angle ACB is not subtending arc AB. Let me think again. In general, the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle ACB intercepts arc AB. Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees, so angle ACB should be 90 degrees. 

But the problem gives angle AOD as 136 degrees. How does that affect things? Maybe there's a typo, or maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me check the original problem again. 

The problem says: "angle AOD = 136.0, then the degree of angle C is ()". So angle C is angle ACB. But according to previous logic, angle ACB should be 90 degrees. But none of the options is 90 degrees. The options are A:44°, B:22°, C:46°, D:36°. So this suggests that my initial assumption is incorrect. Therefore, there must be something missing in my analysis.

Wait, maybe angle ACB is not subtended by arc AB, but by another arc. Let me consider that. Suppose point D is involved. Since angle AOD is given, and point D is on the circle. Maybe angle ACB is related to angle AOD somehow. 

Another possibility: Since angle AOD is 136 degrees, which is a central angle, and maybe there's an inscribed angle related to that. For instance, if there's a point C such that angle COD is related to angle AOD. Wait, but without knowing where point C is relative to D, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ACB is related to the arc that is not AB. For example, if point C is located such that it forms a different arc. Wait, but if AB is the diameter, then regardless of where C is, angle ACB is 90 degrees. Unless... unless the diagram shows that point C is not on the semicircle AB. But the problem states that C is on the circle except A and B. So it must be on the circle, hence forming a right angle with AB. 

But then why is angle AOD given? This suggests that there's more to the problem. Maybe the question is about angle ACD instead of angle ACB? Or maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. 

The user wrote: "Angle(A,C,B)" which corresponds to angle ACB. And the given predicates include PointLiesOnCircle(C,Circle(O)), so point C is on the circle. 

Wait, perhaps the diagram includes point D, and angle AOD is given, so maybe there's a relation between angle AOD and angle ACB via some other inscribed angles. Let me think. 

Suppose we consider the total circle. Since AB is a diameter, the circle is split into two semicircles. The central angle AOD is 136 degrees, so arc AD is 136 degrees. Therefore, arc AD measures 136 degrees. Then, depending on where point C is, angle ACB could be related to other arcs. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle ACB is an inscribed angle that subtends arc AD. But angle ACB would then depend on where C is located. Wait, but how? 

Alternatively, maybe angle ACB is formed by points A, C, B, and there's a connection between angle AOD and angle ACB through some intersecting chords or arcs. 

Let me try to calculate the measure of arc AD first. Since angle AOD is 136 degrees, arc AD is 136 degrees. Then, the rest of the circle would be 360 - 136 = 224 degrees for the remaining arcs. But AB is a diameter, so arc AB is 180 degrees. 

If arc AD is 136 degrees, then arc AB is 180 degrees. Let me imagine the circle. Starting from point A, moving counterclockwise through D to B, but arc AB is 180 degrees. So if arc AD is 136 degrees, then arc DB would be arc AB minus arc AD. Wait, arc AB is from A to B through the semicircle. If arc AD is 136 degrees, then point D is somewhere along the semicircle from A to B, but arc AD is 136 degrees, which is less than 180. So arc DB would be 180 - 136 = 44 degrees. 

Now, if we consider point C. Suppose point C is located somewhere on the circle. If angle ACB is an inscribed angle, then it would depend on which arc it subtends. If angle ACB subtends arc AB, then it's 90 degrees. But if it subtends another arc, like arc AD or arc DB, then it would be half of that. 

Wait, but angle ACB is formed by points A, C, B. So the vertex is at C, with segments CA and CB. Therefore, angle ACB subtends arc AB. Hence, it should be 90 degrees. But again, that doesn't align with the given data. 

Maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me think differently. What if point D is used to form another angle that relates to angle ACB? For example, if there's a triangle or quadrilateral involving points A, C, B, D. 

Alternatively, since OA, OB, OC, OD are all radii, then OA = OB = OC = OD. So triangle OAD is isosceles with OA = OD, and angle at O is 136 degrees. So the base angles at A and D are (180 - 136)/2 = 22 degrees each. So angle OAD = angle ODA = 22 degrees. 

If I can find some relationship between these angles and angle ACB. For example, if angle OAD is 22 degrees, and angle OAC is part of that. Wait, point C is also on the circle. Let me consider triangle OAC. Since OA and OC are radii, triangle OAC is isosceles. Similarly for triangle OBC. 

But how does that help with angle ACB? Let me consider drawing lines from O to C. Since OC is a radius. Let me think about the angles around point O. 

If angle AOD is 136 degrees, and angle AOB is 180 degrees (since AB is the diameter), then angle BOD would be angle AOB - angle AOD = 180 - 136 = 44 degrees. So angle BOD is 44 degrees. 

Now, considering triangle BOD, since OB and OD are radii, it's an isosceles triangle with OB = OD. So the base angles at B and D are equal. The sum of angles in triangle BOD is 180 degrees. So angles at B and D are (180 - 44)/2 = 68 degrees each. 

But how does this relate to angle ACB? Let me think about the arcs again. Arc BD is 44 degrees, as angle BOD is 44 degrees. 

Now, if we consider angle ACB, which is an inscribed angle. If angle ACB subtends arc AB (which is 180 degrees), then it should be 90 degrees. But if it subtends arc BD, then it would be half of 44, which is 22 degrees. But how would angle ACB subtend arc BD? 

Unless point C is located such that it's on the opposite side of the circle relative to arc BD. For example, if point C is on the arc that's opposite to BD, then angle ACB would subtend arc BD. Wait, but angle ACB is formed by points A, C, B. So the position of C affects which arc it subtends. 

Wait, if point C is on the arc that is opposite to arc BD, then angle ACB would subtend arc BD. But if C is on the arc that contains D, then it would subtend arc AB or something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle ACB is related to the arc that is not containing D. For example, if point C is on the arc opposite to D, then angle ACB would subtend arc AD. Wait, but earlier calculation said arc AD was 136 degrees, leading to an inscribed angle of 68 degrees. 

But the given options do not include 68. However, the options are 44, 22, 46, 36. So maybe I'm missing something. 

Let me go back. Earlier, I found that arc BD is 44 degrees. If angle ACB subtends arc BD, then it would be 22 degrees. But how would angle ACB subtend arc BD? 

For angle ACB to subtend arc BD, point C must be located such that when you look from C, the arc BD is the one that's opposite. That would happen if point C is on the arc that doesn't contain D. But since AB is the diameter, and point D is on the arc from A to B, then the arc BD is part of the semicircle AB. 

Wait, if point C is on the opposite semicircle from D, then angle ACB would subtend arc BD. So the measure of angle ACB would be half of arc BD. Arc BD is 44 degrees, so angle ACB would be 22 degrees. Which is option B. 

But why would angle ACB subtend arc BD? Because when you have an inscribed angle, it subtends the arc that is opposite to the angle. So if angle ACB is at point C, then it subtends the arc that is not containing C. So if point C is on the arc opposite to BD, then the arc BD is the one subtended by angle ACB. 

But how do we know where point C is? The problem states that C is any point on the circle except A and B. But since angle AOD is given, and point D is defined, perhaps there's a specific location for C? Or is there a standard configuration?

Wait, the problem might be implying that point C is located such that it creates a specific relationship with D. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that. However, the presence of angle AOD suggests that D is a specific point, and possibly point C is connected to it. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ACB is formed by connecting points A, C, B, and there's a relationship between arcs AD and BD. Since arc AD is 136 degrees, and arc BD is 44 degrees, as previously calculated. 

If angle ACB subtends arc BD, then it would be 22 degrees. Alternatively, if it subtends arc AD, then it would be 68 degrees. Neither of these are in the options, except 22 is option B. 

Wait, but why would angle ACB subtend arc BD? Let me think again. If C is on the circle such that when you connect AC and BC, the angle at C is subtended by arc AB, which is 180 degrees. But if point D is somewhere else, maybe there's another arc involved. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle ACB is related to the arcs created by point D. For example, if line CD intersects AB at some point, but there's no information about that. 

Wait, the problem might involve the fact that angle AOD is 136 degrees, and angle ACB is an inscribed angle that is related to that. Let me think about the central angle AOD of 136 degrees. The inscribed angle subtended by the same arc AD would be 68 degrees. So if there is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD, it would be 68 degrees. But angle ACB is not necessarily that. 

However, if we consider that angle ACB could be part of a triangle or quadrilateral with point D. For example, if we consider triangle ACD or BCD. 

Alternatively, since AB is the diameter, and angle ACB is 90 degrees, but the problem gives angle AOD as 136 degrees. Maybe there's a contradiction, suggesting that the diagram is not the usual one, and that angle ACB is not 90 degrees. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Let me list out all the given information again:

- AB is the diameter of circle O.
- Points C and D are on the circle.
- Angle AOD is 136 degrees.
- OA, OB, OC, OD are radii, so all equal length.
- Need to find measure of angle ACB.

Given that AB is a diameter, and angle AOD is 136 degrees. Let me try to compute the positions of points. 

Assume circle with center O. Let me place point A at (1,0) and point B at (-1,0), so AB is horizontal diameter. Then, angle AOD is 136 degrees. So point D is located such that the angle between OA (from O to A) and OD is 136 degrees. 

If OA is along the positive x-axis, then OD makes an angle of 136 degrees from OA. So point D would be at an angle of 136 degrees from the positive x-axis. 

Coordinates of D would be (cos(136°), sin(136°)). 

Now, point C is another point on the circle. To find angle ACB, which is the angle at point C between points A and B. 

But how does angle AOD relate to angle ACB? Maybe there's a relationship between the arcs. 

Arc AD is 136 degrees, so arc from A to D is 136 degrees. Arc from D to B would be the remaining part of the semicircle AB. Since AB is 180 degrees, arc from A to B is 180 degrees. So arc from D to B is 180 - 136 = 44 degrees. 

Now, if we consider point C, where is it located? If angle ACB is formed by points A, C, B, then the measure of angle ACB depends on where C is. If C is on the arc that is opposite to arc AD, then angle ACB would subtend arc AD. But if C is on the arc that is opposite to arc DB, then it would subtend arc DB. 

Wait, but without knowing where C is, how can we determine angle ACB? The problem must provide enough information to determine it uniquely. 

Ah! Wait, the problem states that angle AOD is 136 degrees, but it doesn't specify where point C is. However, the problem asks for angle ACB, which suggests that it's determined uniquely by the given information. This implies that there's a unique configuration where angle ACB can be determined from angle AOD. 

Perhaps angle ACB is related to the arc that is not involving D. Wait, but how? 

Let me think about the inscribed angles. If I consider the inscribed angle subtended by arc AD, which is 136 degrees, then the inscribed angle would be 68 degrees. If there's a point C such that it forms this angle. 

Alternatively, if angle ACB is formed by two chords AC and BC, then the measure of angle ACB is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Wait, that's the formula for an inscribed angle that intercepts two arcs. 

Wait, no, the formula for the angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. But if the angle is formed by two chords, then it's half the measure of the arc it subtends. 

Wait, in this case, angle ACB is formed by chords AC and BC. So it subtends arc AB, which is 180 degrees, so angle ACB should be 90 degrees. But this contradicts the presence of angle AOD. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a different type of angle, such as an external angle or something else. 

Wait, maybe there's a triangle involving points A, C, D. Let me consider triangle ACD. If we know angle AOD is 136 degrees, and OA and OD are radii, then maybe we can find some angles in triangle ACD. 

In triangle AOD, OA=OD, so it's isosceles. The base angles at A and D are 22 degrees each. So angle OAD = 22 degrees. 

If I can relate this to angle ACB. Suppose line AC intersects with something... 

Alternatively, since OC is a radius, and OA is a radius, triangle AOC is isosceles. So angle OAC = angle OCA. 

But without knowing where point C is, I can't determine these angles. 

Wait, but maybe angle ACB is related to angle AOD through some symmetry. For example, if angle AOD is 136 degrees, then maybe angle ACB is half of the difference between angle AOD and something. 

Alternatively, since arc AD is 136 degrees, and arc AB is 180 degrees, then arc from D to B is 44 degrees. If point C is chosen such that it creates an inscribed angle subtending arc DB, then angle ACB would be half of 44 degrees, which is 22 degrees, matching option B. 

But how to justify that angle ACB subtends arc DB? 

If point C is located such that when you connect AC and BC, the arc subtended by angle ACB is arc DB. This would happen if point C is on the opposite side of the circle from arc DB. 

Imagine the circle with AB as diameter. Arc AB is 180 degrees. Point D is on the arc from A to B, creating arc AD of 136 degrees and arc DB of 44 degrees. If point C is on the opposite semicircle (the one not containing D), then angle ACB would subtend arc DB, which is 44 degrees. Thus, angle ACB would be half of that, which is 22 degrees. 

That matches option B. So the answer would be B:22°. 

This makes sense because angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc DB, which is 44 degrees, hence 22 degrees. 

But why would point C be on the opposite semicircle? Because the problem doesn't specify where C is, but since it's asking for angle ACB, and the given information about angle AOD, it must be that angle ACB is dependent on the position of D. 

Thus, the measure of angle ACB is 22 degrees, which is option B.
