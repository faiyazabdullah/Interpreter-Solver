QUESTION:
Simon has a certain length of fencing to enclose a rectangular area. The quadratic function A with a vertec of (10, 100) models the rectangle's area (in square meters) as a function of its width (in meters). It intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). Which of these statements are true?

CHOICES:
A:Greater width always relates to smaller area.
B:Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than $10 \mathrm{~m}$.
C:When there is no width, the area is $20 \mathrm{~m}^2$.
D:When there is no width, the area is $0 \mathrm{~m}^2$.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, Simon has some fencing to enclose a rectangular area, and there's a quadratic function A with vertex at (10, 100) that models the area as a function of the width. The parabola intersects the x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). We need to figure out which statements about the relationship between width and area are true.

First, I should recall that a quadratic function with a vertex at (h, k) can be written in vertex form as A(w) = a(w - h)^2 + k. Here, the vertex is (10, 100), so substituting that gives A(w) = a(w - 10)^2 + 100. But since the parabola intersects the x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0), those points are roots of the equation A(w) = 0. Wait, but if it's modeling the area, maybe the quadratic isn't directly representing the area but perhaps something else? Or maybe the area is represented by the quadratic function, and the intercepts relate to the width?

Wait, the problem says the quadratic function A models the area as a function of the width. So when the width is w, the area is A(w). The vertex is at (10, 100), which would mean that the maximum area occurs when the width is 10 meters, giving an area of 100 m². However, the parabola intersects the x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). That suggests that when the width is 0 or 20 meters, the area is zero. But wait, how does that make sense? Because if the width is zero, the area should also be zero, which aligns with that point. But why does the parabola cross the x-axis at 20 meters? Maybe because beyond a certain width, the area starts decreasing again?

So the quadratic equation would have roots at w=0 and w=20. Let me write the general form. Since it's a quadratic with roots at 0 and 20, we can express it as A(w) = a*w*(w - 20). Expanding that gives A(w) = a(w² - 20w). Now, the vertex is supposed to be at (10, 100). For a quadratic in the form A(w) = aw² + bw + c, the vertex occurs at w = -b/(2a). In our case, expanding the factored form: A(w) = a w² - 20a w. So the coefficient of w is -20a, so the vertex is at w = -(-20a)/(2a) = 20a/(2a) = 10. That matches the given vertex x-coordinate of 10. So the vertex is indeed at w=10. Then the y-coordinate of the vertex is A(10) = a*(10)^2 - 20a*10 = 100a - 200a = -100a. But according to the problem, the vertex is at (10, 100), so the y-coordinate is 100. Therefore, -100a = 100 → a = -1. 

Therefore, the quadratic function is A(w) = -1*(w)(w - 20) = -w² + 20w. So A(w) = -w² + 20w. 

Now, let's check the area when width is 0: A(0) = 0. When width is 20, A(20) = -(20)^2 + 20*20 = -400 + 400 = 0. Correct. And the vertex at w=10: A(10) = -100 + 200 = 100. Perfect. So the area function is A(w) = -w² + 20w.

Now, looking at the answer choices:

A: Greater width always relates to smaller area.
B: Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than 10 m.
C: When there is no width, the area is 20 m².
D: When there is no width, the area is 0 m².

Let me analyze each option. 

First, the quadratic A(w) = -w² + 20w. This is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum area is at w=10. So for widths less than 10, increasing the width increases the area, and for widths greater than 10, increasing the width decreases the area. 

So statement A says "Greater width always relates to smaller area." But that's not true because before w=10, increasing width increases the area. So A is false. 

Statement B says "Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than 10 m." Wait, but when width is less than 10, increasing width would increase the area, so B seems incorrect. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, if the width is less than 10, then increasing the width would lead to larger area up to 10, then after that, decreasing. So B says "greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than 10". That doesn't make sense. Because if width is less than 10, increasing width would make area bigger, not smaller. So B is wrong. Wait, but maybe the options are phrased differently. Let me recheck the options.

Wait, the options are about whether greater width leads to smaller area. Let me think again. The parabola opens downward, so the area increases until w=10, then decreases. So for widths less than 10, increasing width increases area. For widths more than 10, increasing width decreases area. So the statement B says "Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than 10 m." That would be false because when width is less than 10, increasing width actually increases area. So B is incorrect. 

Then what about the other options. Statement C: When there is no width, the area is 20 m². But when width is zero, A(0)=0. So C is wrong. Statement D: When there is no width, the area is 0 m². Which is correct. So the answer should be D. 

But wait, the problem mentions that the quadratic function models the area as a function of the width. So when the width is zero, the area is zero. Hence, D is correct. 

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem says that the quadratic function A has a vertex at (10, 100), and intersects the x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). So the roots are at w=0 and w=20, so when w=0, A=0. So when there's no width (width is zero), the area is zero. So D is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is D. 

Looking back at the answer choices, D is "When there is no width, the area is 0 m²." So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is D.
