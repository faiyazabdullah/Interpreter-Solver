MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an equilateral triangle with two sides given by the expressions 2x + 11 and 6x - 9. The question is to find the value of x. 

First, I need to recall some properties of equilateral triangles. In an equilateral triangle, all three sides are equal in length, and all angles are 60 degrees. Since the problem mentions two sides, but it's an equilateral triangle, those two sides must be equal. Wait, actually, the problem says there are two sides given here. But since it's equilateral, all sides are equal, so those two sides should be equal to each other. That seems straightforward.

So, the problem gives us two expressions for the lengths of two sides: 2x + 11 and 6x - 9. Because the triangle is equilateral, these two expressions must be equal. Therefore, setting them equal to each other would give an equation to solve for x. Let me write that down.

Setting 2x + 11 = 6x - 9. Now, solving for x. Subtract 2x from both sides: 11 = 4x - 9. Then add 9 to both sides: 20 = 4x. Divide both sides by 4: x = 5. 

Wait, but let me check if there's anything else I need to consider. The problem also mentions that the triangle is equilateral, so all three sides are equal. But the problem only gives two sides. However, since it's equilateral, the third side must also be equal to these two. Therefore, even though we're only given two sides, they must be equal, so solving 2x + 11 = 6x - 9 is sufficient. 

Let me verify my calculation again. Starting with 2x + 11 = 6x - 9. Subtract 2x: 11 = 4x - 9. Add 9: 20 = 4x. Dividing by 4 gives x = 5. So x equals 5. Looking at the answer choices, option B is 5. 

But wait, maybe I should check if substituting x=5 back into the original expressions gives the same value. Let's compute 2x + 11 when x=5: 2*5 + 11 = 10 + 11 = 21. Then 6x -9: 6*5 -9 = 30 -9 = 21. Yes, both equal 21, so that checks out. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B:5. 

I don't see any other constraints or geometric properties that I missed here. Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal, so the two given sides must be equal, leading directly to the equation. Solving that equation gives x=5, which is one of the options. So I think that's solid.
