MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have points A, B, and C on a circle with center O. The angle ABC is given as 130 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle AOC. 

First, I remember that when dealing with circles and angles, there are some key theorems. Like, maybe something about inscribed angles versus central angles? Let me think. Inscribed angles are half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Wait, so if angle ABC is an inscribed angle, then the central angle would be twice that. But wait, angle ABC is at point B, so maybe it's subtending an arc AC. Then the central angle over arc AC would be twice angle ABC. But angle AOC is a central angle because O is the center. So if angle ABC is 130 degrees, then angle AOC should be 2*130, which is 260? That doesn't make sense because the maximum angle in a circle is 180 degrees for a semicircle. Wait, maybe I got the arcs mixed up.

Wait, hold on. Maybe angle ABC isn't subtending arc AC. Let me visualize the diagram. Points A, B, C are on the circle. Angle ABC is formed by points A, B, C. So vertex at B, with BA and BC as sides. So the arc that this angle subtends would be arc AC that does not contain B. Because inscribed angles subtend the opposite arc. So the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC. Therefore, the central angle AOC would be equal to the measure of arc AC. Since angle ABC is 130 degrees, then arc AC would be 2*130=260 degrees. Wait, but that's impossible because the total circumference is 360 degrees. If arc AC is 260 degrees, then the other arc AC (the minor one) would be 100 degrees. But angle ABC is an inscribed angle that subtends the arc AC that's not containing B. Wait, but if the arc AC is 260 degrees, then the central angle AOC would be 260 degrees, but that seems too big. However, in a circle, central angles can be more than 180 degrees. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps angle ABC is actually subtending the arc that's opposite. Let me recall the inscribed angle theorem properly. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle ABC intercepts arc AC. Therefore, the measure of arc AC is 2*(angle ABC). So if angle ABC is 130 degrees, then arc AC is 260 degrees. Therefore, the central angle AOC would be equal to the measure of arc AC, which is 260 degrees. But that's more than 180, which is okay for a central angle. However, in the answer options, none of them is 260. Wait, the options are 100, 110, 120, 130. Hmm, that suggests that my reasoning is wrong. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe angle ABC is not subtending arc AC. Let me think again. In a circle, an inscribed angle's intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle. So if the angle is at point B, then the intercepted arc is the arc AC that does not pass through B. But depending on where B is located, the intercepted arc could be major or minor. Wait, but since the points are arranged such that angle ABC is 130 degrees, which is obtuse. An inscribed angle of 130 degrees would mean that the intercepted arc is 260 degrees. But that would imply that the arc AC is 260 degrees, making the central angle AOC also 260 degrees. But that's not among the answer choices. So there must be a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe angle ABC is actually an external angle? Or perhaps it's not an inscribed angle. Wait, but the points A, B, C are on the circle, so angle ABC is indeed an inscribed angle. Wait, unless B is not on the circumference. Wait, the problem says points A, B, C are on circle O. So they're all on the circumference. So angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Therefore, the intercepted arc is AC. But if that gives us 260 degrees, which leads to a central angle of 260, which is not in the options. Therefore, my initial assumption must be incorrect.

Let me consider another possibility. What if angle ABC is actually a reflex angle? Wait, but angles in polygons are typically considered as the smaller ones unless specified otherwise. However, in circle theorems, the intercepted arc is the arc that is less than 180 degrees if the angle is acute or obtuse. Wait, but if the angle is obtuse, the intercepted arc would be greater than 180 degrees. For example, if the angle is 130 degrees, then the intercepted arc would be 260 degrees. But then the central angle would be 260 degrees. However, the answer options don't include that. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps I'm misapplying the theorem.

Wait, maybe angle ABC is not an inscribed angle. Wait, how? If points A, B, C are on the circle, then angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Unless... Oh! Wait, maybe the angle is not formed by two chords intersecting at B. Wait, but BA and BC are chords of the circle, so yes, angle ABC is an inscribed angle. So why isn't the answer matching?

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to angle ABC being part of a different configuration. Let me check the given predicates again. The problem states that Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are chords of the circle. Also, Line(A,C) is a chord. So triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle. So angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Therefore, according to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of the arc AC that it intercepts. Therefore, arc AC = 2 * 130 = 260 degrees. Hence, the central angle AOC would be equal to the measure of arc AC, which is 260 degrees. But that's not an option. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, but maybe the intercepted arc is not AC but the other arc. For instance, sometimes when you have an inscribed angle, it depends on which arc you take. Suppose that the angle ABC intercepts the arc AC that is opposite, but if the arc AC is the major arc, then the central angle would be 260 degrees. However, if the angle ABC intercepts the minor arc AC, then the measure of the angle would be half of that. But since angle ABC is 130 degrees, which is larger than 90 degrees, that would suggest that the intercepted arc is major arc AC. But in that case, the central angle would be 260 degrees, which still isn't an option. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the relationship between the central angle and the inscribed angle. Let me recall that the central angle is twice the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc. So if angle ABC is 130 degrees, then the central angle over the same arc would be 260 degrees. However, since the sum of all arcs around the circle is 360 degrees, if arc AC is 260 degrees, then the remaining arc (arc AB + arc BC) would be 100 degrees. But that's just a side note. 

But since the answer options don't include 260 degrees, I must have made a mistake. Let me think again. Perhaps angle ABC is not subtending arc AC. Wait, maybe it's subtending arc AB or BC? No, because angle at B would subtend arc AC. Alternatively, could it be that the angle is formed by a tangent and a chord? But the problem states that B is on the circle, so BA and BC are chords. So angle ABC is definitely an inscribed angle. 

Another thought: Maybe the question is referring to the central angle that corresponds to the arc that is not intercepted by angle ABC. Wait, for instance, if the arc AC is the major arc, then the central angle would be 260 degrees. But maybe the question is looking for the other arc? For example, if angle ABC is 130 degrees, then the arc AC that is not intercepted (the minor arc) would be 260 degrees minus 360 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle. So if angle ABC intercepts the major arc AC (which is 260 degrees), then the minor arc AC would be 360 - 260 = 100 degrees. So the central angle corresponding to the minor arc AC is 100 degrees. Therefore, angle AOC would be 100 degrees. Ah! That makes sense. Because angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts the major arc AC, but the central angle AOC is for the minor arc AC. Wait, but how do we know which arc is intercepted?

Wait, the inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the angle's vertex. So if the angle is at B, then the intercepted arc is the arc AC that does not contain B. Depending on where B is located, that arc could be the major arc or the minor arc. 

So, if angle ABC is obtuse (130 degrees), then the intercepted arc AC must be greater than 180 degrees, because the inscribed angle is half of that. So if angle ABC is 130 degrees, intercepted arc AC is 260 degrees. Therefore, the central angle AOC, which corresponds to the arc AC that is the minor arc (since the central angle measures the arc it subtends), would be the remaining part of the circle. Wait, but if the intercepted arc is 260 degrees, then the other arc AC (the minor one) is 100 degrees. Therefore, the central angle AOC would correspond to the minor arc AC, which is 100 degrees. So angle AOC is 100 degrees. Which is option A. 

Yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the answer should be A: 100 degrees. 

Let me verify once more. The inscribed angle ABC is 130 degrees, intercepting arc AC of 260 degrees. The central angle AOC intercepts the other arc AC (minor arc), which is 360 - 260 = 100 degrees. So angle AOC is 100 degrees. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
