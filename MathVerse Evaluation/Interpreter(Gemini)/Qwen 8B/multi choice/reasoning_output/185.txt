MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a circle O with radius 1.0. There's a line L, and the distance from point O to line L is 3.0 units. We need to draw a tangent from any point P on line L to the circle, and the tangent point is Q. Then, using PQ as an edge, form a square PQRS. The question is asking for the minimum area of such a square.

First, I should recall some geometry concepts here. Since there's a circle and a tangent, maybe the Pythagorean theorem will come into play. Also, since it's about minimizing the area, calculus might be involved, but maybe there's a geometric way without calculus.

Let me start by visualizing the setup. Circle O has radius 1. Line L is at a distance of 3 units from O. Point P is somewhere on line L, and PQ is tangent to the circle at Q. Then PQ is one side of the square PQRS. So, the length of PQ would determine the area of the square, since area is side squared. Therefore, to find the minimum area, I need to find the minimum possible length of PQ.

Wait, but how does the position of P affect the length of PQ? Since P moves along line L, different positions of P will give different tangent points Q, leading to different lengths of PQ. Our goal is to find the minimal PQ^2.

So, first, let's think about the length of the tangent from a point outside a circle to the circle. The formula for the length of the tangent from a point to a circle is sqrt[(distance from point to center)^2 - radius^2]. 

In this case, the distance from O to line L is 3.0. But point P lies on line L, so the distance from O to P varies depending on where P is. Wait, but the minimal PQ would correspond to the minimal possible length of the tangent from P to the circle. However, since P is constrained to lie on line L, perhaps we need to minimize the tangent length over all possible positions of P on L.

But wait, the tangent length from P to the circle depends on the distance from P to O. Let me denote the distance from O to P as d. Then, the length of the tangent PQ would be sqrt[d² - r²], where r is the radius of the circle. Here, r = 1. So PQ = sqrt(d² - 1). But since P lies on line L, which is at a fixed distance from O, how does d vary?

Wait, the distance from O to line L is 3.0. That means that the shortest distance from O to L is 3.0 units. However, any point P on line L will have a distance from O that's at least 3.0 units. Because the minimal distance from O to L is 3, so for any P on L, OP ≥ 3. Hence, the minimal possible value of OP is 3, achieved when P is the foot of the perpendicular from O to L.

Therefore, the minimal length of the tangent PQ would occur when OP is minimized, i.e., when P is the closest point on L to O. In that case, OP = 3, so PQ = sqrt(3² - 1²) = sqrt(9 - 1) = sqrt(8) = 2√2. Thus, the minimal PQ is 2√2, making the area of the square PQRS equal to (2√2)² = 8. So the minimal area is 8, which corresponds to answer B.

Wait, but let me verify this. Suppose P is the foot of the perpendicular from O to L. Then, the tangent from P to the circle would have length sqrt(OP² - r²) = sqrt(9 - 1) = sqrt(8). So yes, that gives PQ as 2√2, and the square's area is (2√2)^2=8. So the minimal area is 8. 

But why can't there be a shorter PQ? Because OP cannot be less than 3, as the minimal distance from O to L is 3. So the minimal PQ occurs when OP is minimal. Therefore, the minimal area is 8. So the answer should be B.
