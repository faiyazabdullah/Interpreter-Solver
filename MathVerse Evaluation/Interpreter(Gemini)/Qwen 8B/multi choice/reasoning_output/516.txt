MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about the graph of the exponential function y = 4^x and what we can say about the y-values of every point on it. The answer choices are A, B, C, D.

First, I need to recall some properties of exponential functions. The general form is y = a^x, where a > 0. In this case, a is 4, so the base is 4. Exponential functions have certain characteristics. For example, they're always positive because any positive number raised to a real exponent is positive. Also, their domain is all real numbers, and their range is all positive real numbers. 

So, if I think about the function y = 4^x, when x is any real number, the output y will always be positive. Let me check some specific points. When x = 0, 4^0 = 1. So the point (0,1) is on the graph. When x is positive, like x = 1, y = 4; x = 2, y = 16, etc., which are all positive. When x is negative, say x = -1, y = 1/4, which is still positive. So regardless of x being positive, negative, or zero, y is always positive. That suggests that the y-value of every point on the graph is positive. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B states that the y-value of every point is positive. Option A says most points have y > 1, but since there are points where y is between 0 and 1 (like x=-1 gives y=1/4), that's not true for all points. Option C claims all y-values are integers, but for example, x=0.5 gives y=sqrt(4)=2, which is an integer, but x=0.3 gives y≈4^0.3 ≈ 1.5157... which isn't an integer. So C is incorrect. Option D says most are positive and one point is 0, but the function never reaches 0—it approaches zero as x approaches negative infinity but never actually hits zero. So D is wrong. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.
