MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle, right? And there's some angles mentioned, angle 1 and angle 2. The question says that if angle 1 is 140 degrees, then what's the measure of angle 2?

First, I need to recall some properties of rectangles. In a rectangle, all angles are right angles, so each corner is 90 degrees. But wait, maybe there's something about folding the paper here. When you fold a rectangle, you're creating some sort of crease, which might form new angles. Maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are formed by the fold?

Looking at the given predicates: There's a Rectangle(1). Then MeasureOf(Angle(1)) is 140.0 degrees. Then Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), $), 180.0). So, Angle(1) plus another angle equals 180 degrees. Since Angle(1) is 140, that other angle must be 40 degrees. Then they say Equals($, 40.0), so that second angle is 40 degrees. 

Then there's another part: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), Mul(2, $)), 180.0). So Angle(2) plus twice the same $ (which is 40) equals 180. So Angle(2) + 80 = 180, so Angle(2) would be 100 degrees. Wait, but that seems straightforward. But why is there a rectangle involved?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. When you fold a rectangle, the fold creates an angle. Suppose angle 1 is formed by the fold. For example, if you fold one corner over, creating an angle. Let me visualize a rectangle. Let's say you take a rectangle and fold it such that one corner touches the opposite side. That could create two angles. 

But how does the math fit in here? Let's see. If angle 1 is 140 degrees, then maybe it's an exterior angle created by the fold. Since the original rectangle has 90-degree angles, folding might create supplementary angles. For instance, if you fold along a diagonal, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, maybe the fold creates an angle that's adjacent to a right angle. 

Wait, the first equation: SumOf(Angle(1) and another angle) is 180. Since Angle(1) is 140, the other angle is 40. So that suggests that these two angles are supplementary. So perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary in some way. But then later, there's another equation involving Angle(2) and twice the 40 degrees. So that would make Angle(2) = 180 - 80 = 100 degrees. Which would correspond to answer A. But let me check if that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is related to the fold. Let me think again. If you fold a rectangle, the fold line creates an angle. Let's imagine folding the rectangle so that one edge overlaps with another. For example, suppose you fold the rectangle so that one corner meets the midpoint of the opposite side. This might create an isosceles triangle, leading to certain angle measures.

Another thought: in a rectangle, the sum of adjacent angles is 180 degrees because they are supplementary. However, when folded, the angles might change. For example, if you fold a corner so that the fold line creates an angle of 140 degrees, then the other angle formed by the fold could be 40 degrees. Then, angle 2 could relate to another pair of angles. 

Wait, the second equation involves Angle(2) plus twice 40 degrees equals 180. So Angle(2) is 180 - 80 = 100. Therefore, angle 2 would be 100 degrees. Looking at the options, A is 100. So maybe the answer is A. But why is that the case?

Let me verify. If angle 1 is 140 degrees, then the adjacent angle would be 40 degrees. Now, if there's another angle (angle 2) that's formed by some relation to that 40 degrees, like in a triangle where angle 2 plus two times 40 equals 180. But that would imply angle 2 is 100. Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is part of a different triangle or shape. 

Alternatively, considering that the fold creates an isosceles triangle. If you fold the rectangle such that two sides meet, forming an isosceles triangle. The base angles would be equal. But if angle 1 is 140, which might be the vertex angle. Then the base angles would be (180 - 140)/2 = 20 degrees. But that doesn't seem to align with the given equations. 

Wait, but according to the given predicates, the second equation uses 2*40. So 40 comes from the first equation, which was 180 - 140 = 40. So angle 2 plus 80 equals 180. Therefore, angle 2 is 100. So unless there's some other relationship, this seems straightforward. 

But why is the rectangle involved? Because when you fold a rectangle, the angles created depend on how you fold it. Suppose the fold creates an angle of 140, which is larger than 90, so it's likely that the fold is not along the diagonal. Maybe it's folded such that the flap forms an angle of 140 degrees. Then, the adjacent angle would be 40 degrees. Then, if angle 2 is formed in another part of the fold, like in a triangle where two angles are 40 each, making angle 2 equal to 100. 

So putting it all together, the answer should be 100 degrees, which is option A.
