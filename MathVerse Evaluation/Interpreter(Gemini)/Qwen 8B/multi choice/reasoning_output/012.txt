MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F. Lines AB, CD, DE, EF, FD. Angles 1, 2, EDF, EFD. Also, some relationships like Parallel between AB and CD, RightAngle at EDF, Measure of Angle EDF is 90 degrees. Then there's SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle1) + MeasureOf(AngleF)) equals 70 degrees. And Triangle DEF is mentioned. 

Wait, the question says it's a right triangle DEF with angle EDF being 90 degrees. So triangle DEF has a right angle at D. That means sides ED and DF are perpendicular. 

Also, lines AB and CD are parallel. Points D lies on lines CD, DE, FD. So point D is connected to C, E, and F. Wait, Line(C,D), Line(D,E), Line(F,D). So D is part of those lines. Also, PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(C,D)), so D is on line CD. Similarly, D is on DE and FD. So point D is where lines CD, DE, FD meet. Therefore, triangle DEF is formed with D as one vertex, connected to E and F. Since angle EDF is 90 degrees, that's the right angle in triangle DEF.

Now, the angles mentioned are Angle(1) and Angle(2). The sum of measure of angle1 and angle F (which I assume is angle EFD?) is 70 degrees. The question asks for the measure of angle 2. But wait, the options are in degrees, so maybe angle2 refers to another angle in the diagram.

Let me try to visualize. Let me sketch mentally. There's a right triangle DEF with right angle at D. So DEF is a right-angled triangle at D. Then there's line AB parallel to CD. Maybe AB is another line somewhere? Also, points B is on AB, which is parallel to CD. 

But how do these elements connect? Let me think about the angles. The problem mentions angle1 and angle2. The sum of angle1 and angle F (probably angle at F, which is angle EFD) is 70 degrees. Need to find angle2. 

Since DEF is a right triangle, the sum of angles in triangle DEF should be 180 degrees. We know angle at D is 90 degrees, so the other two angles, at E and F, must add up to 90 degrees. Wait, but angle EFD is one of them. Let me denote angle at E as angle DEF and angle at F as angle DFE. Wait, but the problem mentions angle EDF is 90 degrees. So in triangle DEF, angle at D is 90°, so angles at E and F sum to 90°. 

Now, the problem states that angle1 + angle F = 70°. Assuming angle F here refers to angle DFE (angle at F in triangle DEF), then angle1 plus angle DFE equals 70°. But since angle DFE is part of the triangle, which would make angle DEF = 90° - angle DFE. However, without more info, perhaps angle1 is another angle in the diagram?

Alternatively, maybe angle1 and angle2 are angles formed due to the parallel lines AB and CD. Since AB is parallel to CD, maybe there are transversal lines creating corresponding or alternate angles. For example, if there's a transversal crossing AB and CD, creating angles that could relate to angle1 and angle2. But where is line AB in relation to the triangle DEF? 

Wait, the problem says "the straight line AB parallel CD". So AB || CD. Now, since D is on CD, and AB is parallel to CD, maybe line AB is intersected by another line, say, line DE or something? Or perhaps line BF? Not sure yet. 

Another thing: the problem mentions points E and F lying on certain lines. For instance, E lies on DE and EF, F lies on EF and FD. So triangle DEF is fixed with D connected to E and F, forming the right angle at D. 

Maybe angle1 and angle2 are angles outside the triangle, created by the parallel lines AB and CD. For example, suppose there's a transversal connecting points A and E, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe angle1 is an angle formed by line AB and some other line, and angle2 relates to the triangle DEF. 

Wait, the problem states that angle1 + angle F = 70°, and we need to find angle2. Let me consider that angle F is angle DFE in triangle DEF. In triangle DEF, angles at E and F sum to 90°, so angle DEF + angle DFE = 90°. If angle DFE is angle F, then angle DEF = 90° - angle F. 

But the problem also gives that angle1 + angle F = 70°, so angle1 = 70° - angle F. Now, if angle1 is related to angle DEF, which is 90° - angle F, then angle1 could be equal to angle DEF. Suppose angle1 is equal to angle DEF. Then angle1 = 90° - angle F. But according to the problem, angle1 + angle F = 70°, so substituting angle1 = 90° - angle F into this equation gives 90° - angle F + angle F = 90° = 70°, which is impossible. So that suggests my assumption is wrong. 

Alternative approach: Maybe angle1 is an exterior angle. For example, if AB is parallel to CD, and there's a transversal cutting them, creating corresponding angles. Let's imagine that line DE intersects AB and CD. Wait, point D is on CD, so line DE starts at D and goes to E. If AB is parallel to CD, then line DE could act as a transversal. So angle between DE and AB could correspond to angle between DE and CD. But since AB || CD, the corresponding angles would be equal. 

Suppose angle1 is the angle between AB and DE. Then because AB || CD, the corresponding angle would be the angle between CD and DE. But angle between CD and DE is angle CDE. Wait, but point D is on CD, so line CD extends to D. Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, since AB is parallel to CD, and if there's a line connecting B to E or something, creating some angles. Maybe angle1 is an alternate interior angle? 

Alternatively, considering triangle DEF and the parallel lines. Since AB is parallel to CD, and assuming that line AB is connected to point B, which is on AB. Maybe there's a way to form similar triangles or use properties of parallel lines. 

Wait, the problem mentions angle EDF is 90°, which is the right angle. Also, there's angle EFD, which is angle F. So in triangle DEF, angle at F is angle EFD. If we can relate angle1 and angle2 to angles in triangle DEF via the parallel lines. 

Another thought: Since AB || CD, and if there's a transversal that creates angles with them. Suppose line EF is a transversal. Wait, line EF connects E and F. If AB || CD, and line EF crosses both AB and CD, then corresponding angles could be formed. For example, angle between EF and AB could correspond to angle between EF and CD. But without knowing where exactly these lines are, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe angle1 is an angle formed by AB and some other line, and angle2 is an angle inside the triangle. But I need to link angle1 and angle2 with the given information. 

Wait, the problem says SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)),MeasureOf(Angle(E,F,D)),70.0). So angle(E,F,D) is angle at F, which is angle DFE. So angle1 + angle DFE = 70°. 

In triangle DEF, angles at D=90°, E, and F. So angle E + angle F = 90°. Therefore, angle E = 90° - angle F. 

Now, if angle1 + angle F = 70°, and angle E = 90° - angle F, then angle E = 90° - (70° - angle1) = 20° + angle1. 

But unless there's a relationship between angle E and angle1, I don't see how to proceed. Perhaps angle1 is equal to angle E? Or maybe angle1 is an external angle to triangle DEF? 

Wait, if AB is parallel to CD, and there's a line connecting A to D, creating some angles. Let me imagine AB || CD, and AD is a transversal. Then, the corresponding angles would be equal. But without knowing where A is located, this is tricky. 

Alternatively, since AB is parallel to CD, and D is on CD, then AB is parallel to the line CD which contains D. So line AB is parallel to line CD, which includes point D. So line AB is parallel to line CD, but they may not intersect. 

Perhaps there's a triangle involving AB and CD? Like, if there's a line connecting B to D, creating some angles. 

Alternatively, since angle EDF is 90°, and AB || CD, maybe there's a way to relate angles around point D. For example, if line AB is parallel to CD, and there's a line from D to B, then angle between AB and DB could be related to angle between CD and DB. 

Wait, maybe angle1 is the angle between AB and BD, and angle2 is another angle. But this is too vague. 

Alternatively, maybe angle1 is an exterior angle to triangle DEF. For example, if there's a line extending from E or F that forms an angle with AB. 

Wait, let's take a different approach. From the given data, we know that in triangle DEF, angles at E and F add up to 90°, so angle E + angle F = 90°. Also, angle1 + angle F = 70°, so angle1 = 70° - angle F. 

If I can express angle E in terms of angle1, then substitute into angle E + angle F = 90°. 

From angle1 = 70° - angle F, rearranged as angle F = 70° - angle1. Substituting into angle E + angle F = 90°, we get angle E + (70° - angle1) = 90° → angle E = 90° - 70° + angle1 → angle E = 20° + angle1. 

But unless there's a relationship between angle E and angle1, I can't find numerical values. 

Wait, perhaps angle1 is equal to angle E? If that were true, then angle1 = angle E = 20° + angle1 → 0 = 20°, which isn't possible. So that's not the case. 

Alternatively, angle1 could be supplementary to angle E, but again, not sure. 

Another idea: Maybe angle1 is an angle formed by the parallel lines AB and CD with another transversal. For example, if line EF is a transversal cutting AB and CD, then angle1 could be a corresponding or alternate angle. 

Assuming that, if AB || CD, and line EF cuts them, then the corresponding angles would be equal. For example, if angle between EF and AB is equal to angle between EF and CD. But angle between EF and CD at point F is angle DFE, which is angle F. So if angle1 is equal to angle F, then angle1 = angle F. But the problem states angle1 + angle F = 70°, so that would mean 2*angle F = 70° → angle F = 35°, making angle E = 90° - 35° = 55°. But then where does angle2 come into play? 

But the question asks for angle2, which hasn't been defined yet. Wait, the problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(2). So maybe angle2 is another angle related to the diagram. 

Looking back at the predicates, there's also Angle(2) mentioned. So angle2 is another angle whose measure we need to find. How is angle2 related? 

Possibly, angle2 is angle at E, which is angle DEF. Because in triangle DEF, angle at E is angle DEF, which is one of the non-right angles. Earlier, we had angle E = 20° + angle1. But if angle1 is equal to angle F, then angle E = 20° + angle F, but angle E + angle F = 90°, leading to angle E = 90° - angle F. Combining equations: 90° - angle F = 20° + angle F → 90° - 20° = 2*angle F → 70° = 2*angle F → angle F = 35°, so angle E = 55°, and angle1 = 70° - angle F = 35°. 

But then angle2 might refer to angle E, which is 55°, but none of the options match that. Wait, the options are 20°, 25°, 30°, 40°. So 55° is not among them. So this suggests my assumption is incorrect. 

Alternative possibility: Maybe angle2 is angle1? No, because angle1 is already involved in the sum. 

Wait, let me check the original problem statement again. It says "angle 1 + angle F = 70.0", and asks for the measure of angle 2. The options are A-D. Maybe angle2 is the other angle in the triangle DEF, i.e., angle E? Or angle2 is an angle formed by the parallel lines AB and CD with another line. 

Wait, since AB || CD, and if there's a transversal cutting them, say line DE, then angle between AB and DE could be equal to angle between CD and DE. But angle between CD and DE is angle CDE. But point D is on CD, so line CD extends to D, and line DE starts at D. So angle between CD and DE is angle CDE, which is part of triangle CDE? But I don't have information about point C. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and if there's a transversal that creates an angle with AB and CD, such as line BF. But without knowing where point B is, this is unclear. 

Wait, maybe angle1 is an angle formed by AB and some other line, while angle2 is an angle in triangle DEF. For example, if angle1 is an alternate interior angle with respect to AB || CD and a transversal, then angle1 equals angle between CD and the transversal. Which could be angle CDE or something. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and if there's a line connecting B to E, forming an angle with AB, which corresponds to an angle with CD. 

This seems too vague. Let's try another approach. Let's consider the given that angle1 + angle F = 70°, and angle F is part of triangle DEF. Also, angle EDF is 90°, so angles in triangle DEF give us angle E + angle F = 90°. So combining with angle1 + angle F = 70°, we can set up equations. 

If angle1 is related to angle E, then maybe angle1 is equal to angle E. If that's the case, then angle1 = angle E. So from angle1 + angle F = 70°, and angle E + angle F = 90°, we can subtract the first equation from the second: (angle E + angle F) - (angle1 + angle F) = 90° - 70° → angle E - angle1 = 20°. But if angle1 = angle E, then angle E - angle E = 20° → 0 = 20°, which is impossible. So angle1 cannot be equal to angle E. 

Alternatively, angle1 is supplementary to angle E. So angle1 + angle E = 180°, but that doesn't fit either. 

Wait, perhaps angle1 is an exterior angle to triangle DEF. For example, if there's an extension of one of its sides creating an angle with AB. Let's say, extend side DE beyond E to a point G, forming an angle with AB. Since AB || CD, maybe that angle is equal to angle between CD and EG. But without a diagram, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and if there's a transversal that creates an angle with AB and CD, which relates to angle1 or angle2. 

Wait, maybe angle1 is equal to angle DFE (angle F), and angle2 is angle DEF (angle E). Then, from angle1 + angle F = 70°, if angle1 = angle F, then angle F = 35°, so angle E = 90° - 35° = 55°. But 55° isn't an option. 

Alternatively, angle1 is angle DEF (angle E), then angle1 + angle F = 70°, and since angle E + angle F = 90°, we can set up:

angle1 + angle F = 70°  
angle1 + angle F = 90° (from triangle)

Wait, that would imply 70° = 90°, which is impossible. So that can't be. 

Hmm. This is getting confusing. Let me try to look for another way. 

Given that AB || CD, and angle EDF is 90°, maybe there's a way to form a parallelogram or use properties of parallel lines with right angles. 

For example, if AB || CD and there's a right angle at D, maybe there's a rectangle or square involved. But without knowing more about the placement of points, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, the problem mentions PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(C,D)), which just confirms that D is on line CD. Also, PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(D,E)) and others, confirming the triangle DEF. 

Another idea: Since AB || CD, and D is on CD, then AB is parallel to the line containing D. So if we draw a line from A to D, since AB || CD, the angle between AB and AD would be equal to the angle between CD and AD. But angle between CD and AD at point D is angle ADC. But since D is on CD, line CD continues past D, so angle ADC would be a straight line, but not sure. 

Alternatively, if there's a line from B to D, since AB || CD, then the angle between AB and BD would be equal to the angle between CD and BD. But again, without knowing where B is, it's hard to determine. 

Wait, but the problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(2). Maybe angle1 and angle2 are angles formed by the intersection of lines AB, CD, and some other lines, like DE or DF. 

For example, if line AB intersects with line DE at some point, creating an angle, which is angle1. Similarly, another intersection creating angle2. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and line DE intersects both AB and CD, creating corresponding angles. Let's say, the angle between AB and DE is equal to the angle between CD and DE. The angle between CD and DE is angle CDE. But angle CDE is part of line CD extended to E? Wait, line CD goes from C to D, and line DE goes from D to E. So the angle between CD and DE is angle CDE, which is at point D. But since D is on CD, angle CDE is actually a straight line? No, because line CD ends at D, and line DE starts at D. So angle between CD and DE at point D is angle CDE, which is part of the triangle CDE? But I don't have info about point C. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and if there's a line from B to E, creating an angle with AB, which would correspond to an angle with CD. 

At this point, I think I need to focus on the given information and try to relate the angles mathematically. 

We have:

In triangle DEF: angle D = 90°, so angles at E and F sum to 90°. Let’s call angle at E as x, angle at F as y. So x + y = 90°.

Given that angle1 + y = 70°, so angle1 = 70° - y.

We need to find angle2. What is angle2? It could be angle x, or another angle. 

If angle2 is angle x, then we can write angle x = 90° - y. From angle1 = 70° - y, we can express y = 70° - angle1. Substituting into angle x: 90° - (70° - angle1) = 20° + angle1. 

But unless we have another equation relating angle1 and angle x, we can't find numerical values. 

Unless angle1 is related to angle x through some other property. For example, if angle1 is equal to angle x, then angle1 = x = 20° + angle1 → 0 = 20°, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if angle1 is supplementary to angle x, then angle1 + x = 180°, but x = 20° + angle1 → angle1 + 20° + angle1 = 180° → 2 angle1 = 160° → angle1 = 80°, then x = 20° + 80° = 100°, which exceeds 90°, impossible. 

Hmm. Another possibility: angle1 is an angle outside the triangle, related to the parallel lines. For example, if AB || CD and there's a transversal creating an angle with AB that equals angle1, and this angle is related to angle x or y. 

Let me think: Since AB || CD, and if there's a transversal intersecting both lines, say line DE, then the corresponding angles would be equal. Let's say the angle between AB and DE is equal to the angle between CD and DE. The angle between CD and DE at point D is angle CDE. But since D is on CD, line CD extends to D, and line DE starts at D. So angle between CD and DE is angle CDE, which is a straight line? No, because line CD goes from C to D, and line DE goes from D to E. So the angle between CD and DE at D is angle CDE, which is a straight line only if E is on the extension of CD, but it's not necessarily the case. 

Wait, but if AB || CD, and line DE is a transversal, then the angle between AB and DE (at point B) would be equal to the angle between CD and DE (at point D). Let's call this angle α. So angle between AB and DE = α, and angle between CD and DE = α. 

If this angle α is angle1, then angle1 = α. But what is α? At point D, angle between CD and DE is angle CDE, which is not directly given. But if we can relate this to the triangle DEF. 

Alternatively, maybe angle1 is angle CDE, which is equal to angle between CD and DE. But without knowing where point C is, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if line AB is parallel to CD, and line DE intersects them, then angle between AB and DE is equal to angle between CD and DE. If this angle is angle1, then angle1 = angle between CD and DE. But angle between CD and DE at D is angle CDE. If we can express angle CDE in terms of other angles. 

But since D is on CD, and line DE is connected to E, which is part of triangle DEF. So angle CDE is adjacent to angle EDF (which is 90°). Wait, if CD and DE meet at D, then angle CDE + angle EDF = 180°, because they are supplementary. Since angle EDF is 90°, then angle CDE = 90°. So angle between CD and DE at D is 90°, implying that line CD and DE are perpendicular. But that would mean that line DE is perpendicular to CD, making angle CDE = 90°, which would make line DE perpendicular to CD. But in that case, angle between CD and DE is 90°, so angle1 (if it's equal to that) would be 90°, but the sum angle1 + angle F = 70° would require angle F = -20°, which is impossible. So this suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Wait, why did I think angle CDE + angle EDF = 180°? Because they are adjacent angles at point D. If CD and DE meet at D, then angle CDE and angle EDF would be adjacent if line DF is in a particular direction. But since angle EDF is 90°, and if CD and DE are meeting at D, then angle between CD and DE (angle CDE) plus angle EDF (90°) would depend on the configuration. 

Actually, if line DE meets CD at D, then angle CDE is part of the line CD and DE. Depending on the direction of DE, angle CDE could vary. But since angle EDF is 90°, and F is another point, this might not directly affect angle CDE. 

At this point, I'm stuck trying to relate angle1 to the triangle DEF. Maybe I should consider that angle2 is the missing angle in some triangle or relation. 

Given the options are 20°, 25°, 30°, 40°, and the sum angle1 + angle F = 70°, and angle F is part of triangle DEF, let's assume angle2 is angle F. Then angle2 = angle F = 70° - angle1. But without knowing angle1, this doesn't help. 

Wait, earlier I had angle E = 20° + angle1. If angle2 is angle E, then angle2 = 20° + angle1. But we also know from triangle DEF that angle E + angle F = 90°, and angle1 + angle F = 70°. Let me write down these equations:

1. angle E + angle F = 90°
2. angle1 + angle F = 70°
3. angle2 = angle E

From 1 and 2: Subtract 2 from 1: angle E - angle1 = 20°. But angle2 = angle E, so angle2 - angle1 = 20°. So angle2 = angle1 + 20°. 

But we still have two variables here: angle1 and angle2. Unless there's another relationship. 

Maybe angle1 is related to angle2 through the parallel lines. For example, if angle1 is an alternate interior angle with respect to AB || CD, making it equal to angle2. 

Assume angle1 = angle2. Then from above, angle2 = angle1 + 20°, so angle1 = angle1 + 20° → 0 = 20°, impossible. 

Alternatively, angle1 is supplementary to angle2. So angle1 + angle2 = 180°. Then from angle2 = angle1 + 20°, substitute: angle1 + (angle1 + 20°) = 180° → 2 angle1 = 160° → angle1 = 80°, angle2 = 100°, which is impossible as it exceeds 90°. 

Hmm. Another possibility: angle1 is equal to angle2. But this leads to contradiction. 

Wait, maybe angle1 is angle CDE, which we previously thought was 90°, but that led to inconsistency. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and if there's a transversal creating an angle with AB equal to angle2. For example, if angle2 is an alternate interior angle with AB || CD, then angle2 equals some other angle. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

Wait, let's try plugging in the answer choices. Suppose angle2 is 20°, then from angle2 = angle E = 20°, and angle E + angle F = 90°, so angle F = 70°. Then angle1 + angle F = 70° → angle1 + 70° = 70° → angle1 = 0°, which is impossible. 

Next option: angle2 = 25°. So angle E = 25°, angle F = 65°, angle1 = 70° - 65° = 5°. Not sure if this fits with any geometric relations. 

Option C: angle2 = 30°. Then angle E = 30°, angle F = 60°, angle1 = 70° - 60° = 10°. Still arbitrary. 

Option D: angle2 = 40°. Then angle E = 40°, angle F = 50°, angle1 = 70° - 50° = 20°. 

Now, if angle1 is 20°, and angle2 is 40°, how does that relate? Maybe angle1 is 20°, and angle2 is 40°, and there's a relationship between them. For example, if angle1 is an angle formed by the parallel lines and angle2 is an angle in the triangle. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, if angle1 is 20° and angle2 is 40°, then angle1 + angle2 = 60°, which might relate to other angles. 

But why would angle1 be 20°? If angle1 is an angle formed by AB || CD and a transversal, and if angle1 is equal to angle CDE, which we previously thought might be 90°, but that didn't work. 

Alternatively, if angle1 is 20°, and angle2 is 40°, and angle1 is part of a triangle or something. 

Wait, let's revisit the earlier equations. We had angle2 = angle E = 20° + angle1. If angle2 is 40°, then 40° = 20° + angle1 → angle1 = 20°. Then angle1 + angle F = 70° → 20° + angle F = 70° → angle F = 50°. Then in triangle DEF, angle E = 40°, angle F = 50°, which sums to 90°, as required. 

This works! So angle2 is 40°, which is option D. 

Therefore, the answer is D.
