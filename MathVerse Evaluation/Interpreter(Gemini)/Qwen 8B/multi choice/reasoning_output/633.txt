QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of $y=\sin x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(90^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=5 \sin x$

CHOICES:
No choices found.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding the first maximum point of the function y = 5 sin x for x ≥ 0. The original sine function y = sin x has its first maximum at (90°, 1). Now, we need to consider how the transformation affects this point.

First, I remember that transforming a function like y = a sin x involves a vertical scaling. The amplitude of the sine function is multiplied by 'a'. In this case, the coefficient is 5, so the amplitude becomes 5 times larger. That means the maximum value of the function y = 5 sin x will be 5 instead of 1. However, the period of the sine function remains the same because there's no horizontal stretch or compression mentioned here. 

So, the period is still 360 degrees, which means the function completes one full cycle every 360 degrees. Therefore, the first maximum should occur at the same x-value where the original sine function reaches its maximum. For y = sin x, that's at x = 90°. Since the transformation only scales the output vertically, the x-coordinate of the maximum doesn't change. 

Therefore, the first maximum point for y = 5 sin x would be at (90°, 5). But wait, looking back at the problem statement, they mention that the original graph passes through (90,1) and is symmetric about the origin. The question specifically asks for the first maximum point for x ≥ 0. Since the vertical scaling doesn't affect the x-values where maxima occur, the x-coordinate remains 90°, but the y-coordinate is scaled by 5. 

Wait, but the answer choices aren't listed here. Oh, the user said "No choices found." But maybe they expect me to infer the answer based on the given info. Let me check again. The original maximum is at (90,1). After scaling by 5, it's (90,5). So the coordinates would be (90°, 5). But since the options weren't provided, perhaps the answer is (90,5). But the user hasn't given options. Wait, the initial problem says "state the coordinates of the first maximum point" and the answer choices were supposed to be there. But in the problem description, the user mentions "Answer Choices: No choices found." So maybe the system expects me to provide the answer directly. But according to the instructions, I have to choose from A to D, but since there are no choices, maybe the intended answer is (90,5). However, the user's setup might have had options, but they didn't show them. Alternatively, maybe the question was part of a set where the answer is among the given points. But without seeing the options, I can only deduce based on the given info. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to another transformation. Wait, the original graph is of y=sin x passing through those points. The question is about y=5 sin x. The first maximum occurs at the same x as before, just scaled up. So the coordinates would be (90°, 5). Therefore, the answer is (90,5). But if the answer choices included that, then that's the answer. Since the user hasn't provided options, but the initial problem might have had options, but the user input shows "No choices found," perhaps there's confusion. But based on the given info, the answer is (90,5).
