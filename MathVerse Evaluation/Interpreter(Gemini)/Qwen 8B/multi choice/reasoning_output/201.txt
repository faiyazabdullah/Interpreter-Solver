Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a circle with center M, and two chords AC and TN. The distances from M to these chords are equal. We need to find the measure of angle CAM. The answer choices are 14, 28, 36, or 90 degrees.

First, I'll start by recalling some geometry concepts. Since AC and TN are chords of the circle centered at M, their distances from the center should relate to their lengths. But wait, the problem says the distances from M to the two chords are equal. Hmm. Also, there are several other given predicates about points lying on the circle, radii, and isosceles triangles.

Let me parse the given predicates again. Points A, C, T, N are all on the circle with center M. That means MA, MC, MT, MN are all radii. So, MA = MC = MT = MN. Therefore, triangles MAC and MNT are isosceles because they have two sides equal (MA=MC and MT=MN respectively). 

Also, it's mentioned that the chords AC and TN have equal distances from M. Wait, but since they are chords of the same circle, if their distances from the center are equal, then their lengths must be equal? Because the length of a chord depends on its distance from the center. The formula for the length of a chord is 2√(r² - d²), where r is the radius and d is the distance from the center. If the distances d are equal, then their lengths would be equal. So, AC = TN. 

But looking at the given predicates, we also have Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,A)), LengthOf(Line(M,C))) which is obvious since they're radii. Similarly, Equals(LengthOf(Line(M,T)), LengthOf(Line(M,N))). But that just confirms that MA=MC and MT=MN, which we already knew. However, since AC and TN are chords, their lengths depend on the angle subtended at the center. For example, the length of chord AC can be found using the law of cosines in triangle MAC. Since MA=MC=r, the length AC would be sqrt(r² + r² - 2*r*r*cos(theta)), where theta is the central angle AMC. Similarly for TN. 

Since the distances from M to the chords are equal, and those distances are related to the length of the chords. Let me recall that the distance from the center to a chord is given by d = r * cos(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. Wait, no, more accurately, the distance from the center to the chord is d = r * cos(theta/2) if theta is the central angle. Alternatively, another way: if the central angle is θ, then the distance from the center to the chord is d = r * cos(θ/2). Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The perpendicular distance from the center to the chord divides the chord into two equal parts. So, if we consider the right triangle formed by the radius, half the chord, and the distance from the center to the chord. Then, (distance)^2 + (half chord length)^2 = r^2. 

So, if the distance from M to chord AC is equal to the distance from M to chord TN, then their respective half-chords would satisfy:

For chord AC: d_AC^2 + (AC/2)^2 = r^2  
For chord TN: d_TN^2 + (TN/2)^2 = r^2  

But since d_AC = d_TN, then (AC/2)^2 = (TN/2)^2 → AC = TN. Which we already know from earlier. But how does this help us?

Wait, but perhaps the fact that the distances are equal implies something about the angles. Since the central angles over AC and TN would be related. But how?

Alternatively, since AC and TN are chords with equal distances from M, their central angles could be different but their distances are the same. But maybe there's another relationship here.

Now, the problem asks for angle CAM. Let me visualize triangle CAM. Since MA and MC are both radii, so triangle MAC is isosceles with MA = MC. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. Wait, angle CAM is at point A, between CA and AM. Wait, angle CAM is the angle at point A between points C, A, and M. Wait, no. Angle CAM is at point A, with segments CA and AM. Wait, but point M is the center, so AM is a radius. So, triangle CAM has vertices at C, A, M. So angle at A is angle CAM. In triangle CAM, since MA = MC, the base angles at A and C are equal. Wait, but in triangle MAC, sides MA and MC are equal, so the base angles at A and C are equal. Therefore, angle CAM equals angle ACM.

But we need to find angle CAM. How can we find this?

We might need to relate this angle to the central angle. Let me denote the central angle for chord AC as θ. Then, in triangle MAC, which is isosceles with sides MA = MC = r, and base AC. The vertex angle at M is θ. Then, the base angles at A and C would each be (180° - θ)/2. Therefore, angle CAM = (180° - θ)/2.

But how do we find θ? Well, θ is the central angle corresponding to chord AC. The distance from M to chord AC is d_AC = r * cos(θ/2). Similarly, for chord TN, distance is d_TN = r * cos(φ/2), where φ is the central angle for TN. Given that d_AC = d_TN, so r * cos(θ/2) = r * cos(φ/2), hence cos(θ/2) = cos(φ/2). Therefore, either θ/2 = φ/2 + 360°n or θ/2 = -φ/2 + 360°n. But since angles are between 0° and 180°, θ and φ must be between 0° and 180°, so θ/2 and φ/2 are between 0° and 90°, so cos(θ/2)=cos(φ/2) implies θ/2 = φ/2 or θ/2 = -φ/2. But since angles are positive, θ/2 = φ/2 ⇒ θ = φ. Therefore, the central angles for AC and TN are equal. Thus, θ = φ. Therefore, the central angles for chords AC and TN are equal. Hence, their lengths are equal, which we already knew.

But how does that help us with angle CAM?

Wait, perhaps there's another piece of information given. Looking back at the predicates, there's MeasureOf(Angle(M,T,N),28). So, angle at point T, between points M, T, N. Wait, angle MTN is 28 degrees. Wait, angle MTN is part of triangle MNT, which is isosceles with MT=MN. Therefore, in triangle MNT, angles at T and N are equal. Wait, but angle at T is given as 28 degrees. Wait, angle MTN is the angle at T, so in triangle MNT, which is isosceles with MT=MN, the base angles at T and N are equal. Wait, but angle at T is given as 28 degrees. Therefore, angle at N is also 28 degrees. Then, the vertex angle at M is 180 - 2*28 = 124 degrees. So, the central angle for chord TN is 124 degrees. Therefore, the central angle φ for TN is 124 degrees. Earlier, we concluded that the central angles for AC and TN are equal, so θ = φ = 124 degrees. Therefore, the central angle for chord AC is also 124 degrees.

Therefore, going back to triangle MAC, which is isosceles with central angle θ = 124 degrees. Then, the base angles at A and C are (180 - 124)/2 = 56/2 = 28 degrees. Therefore, angle CAM is 28 degrees. Wait, but angle CAM is one of the base angles. Wait, yes! Because in triangle MAC, angle at A is angle CAM, which is equal to angle at C. Therefore, angle CAM is 28 degrees. So the answer would be 28, which is option B.

Wait, but let me check again. The given angle was MeasureOf(Angle(M,T,N),28). So angle MTN is 28 degrees. Since triangle MNT is isosceles with MT=MN, so angles at T and N are equal. Therefore, angle at T (which is angle MTN) is 28 degrees, so angle at N is also 28 degrees. Then, angle at M is 180 - 28 -28 = 124 degrees. So the central angle for TN is 124 degrees. Therefore, central angle for AC is also 124 degrees. Then, in triangle MAC, which is isosceles with vertex angle at M being 124 degrees, so the base angles at A and C are (180-124)/2 = 28 degrees. Therefore, angle CAM is 28 degrees. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but why is the distance from M to the chords equal? Did we use that? Oh, because we used the fact that the central angles were equal due to the distances being equal. Since the distances are equal, their central angles must be equal. Therefore, leading us to conclude that the central angle for AC is 124 degrees, hence leading to angle CAM being 28 degrees. Therefore, the answer is B.

But let me make sure there isn't any mistake here. Another way to look at it: since the distances from M to the chords are equal, then their central angles are equal. Therefore, angle for AC equals angle for TN. And since angle for TN is 124 degrees, angle for AC is also 124 degrees, leading to angle CAM being 28 degrees. Yes, that seems consistent.

So the answer is B.
