====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric configuration. 

Starting with the points and lines. There are eight points labeled A to H. The lines form several rectangles. For example, Rectangle(A,B,F,E) suggests that points A, B, F, E form a rectangle. Similarly, there are other rectangles like B,C,G,F and so on. Each of these rectangles likely shares sides with others, forming a 3D structure since it mentions a square prism with sides 3cm, 3cm, and 14cm. 

Looking at the lengths: All sides of the rectangles have lengths either 3cm or 14cm. For instance, LengthOf(A,B,3) means AB is 3 units, same for BC, CD, DA, EF, FG, GH, HE. But then there are longer lengths like AE, BF, CG, DH being 14 units. Also, Angle(D,F,H) has measure 0°, but wait, the problem says to find θ where ∠DFH is θ degrees. Wait, the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) implies that angle D-F-H is 0°? That seems odd because an angle of 0° would mean the points are colinear. But maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check again.

Wait, the user mentioned that the problem states "the size of ∠DFH is θ°", and the given predicates have MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0). So according to the predicates, angle D-F-H is 0°, which would imply that points D, F, H are colinear, making ∠DFH straight, hence 180°, but the measure is given as 0. That contradiction needs clarification. Maybe there's a misinterpretation here. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is measured in some way that wraps around, but standard angles don't go beyond 180° unless considering directed angles. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is meant to be reflex, but typically angles in polygons are considered as internal angles, so they should be less than 180°. However, if the given measure is 0°, that suggests that points D, F, H are colinear with F between D and H. But then ∠DFH would be a straight line, so the angle would be 180°, not 0. This seems conflicting. Perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the predicates. Let me re-examine the given data.

Wait, looking back, there's also HypotenuseOf(Line(D,F),Triangle(D,E,F)) and RightAngle(Angle(D,E,F)). So Triangle DEF is a right triangle with hypotenuse DF. Since DEF is a right triangle, and DF is the hypotenuse, then angle at E is the right angle. Therefore, DE and EF are the legs, and DF is the hypotenuse. Given that DE is part of the rectangle D,A,E,H, so DE is one side of the rectangle. From the LengthOf(D,E,3) and LengthOf(E,F,3)? Wait, no, let me check the lengths again.

From the given LengthOf(D,E,3)? Wait, checking the list of LengthOfs:

LengthOf(A,B,3)

LengthOf(B,C,3)

LengthOf(C,D,3)

LengthOf(D,A,3)

LengthOf(E,F,3)

LengthOf(F,G,3)

LengthOf(G,H,3)

LengthOf(H,E,3)

LengthOf(A,E,14)

LengthOf(B,F,14)

LengthOf(C,G,14)

LengthOf(D,H,14)

So DE is part of the rectangle D,A,E,H. Since D-A-E-H forms a rectangle, DA is 3, AE is 14, so DE would be another side. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So DA is connected to A, which connects to E. So DA is horizontal (assuming standard orientation), and AE is vertical. Then DE would be the diagonal of the rectangle DAEH? No, because D-A-E-H is a rectangle, so D connected to A, A connected to E, E connected to H, H connected to D. So DE is connecting D to E, which are opposite corners of the rectangle. Therefore, DE is a diagonal of the rectangle DAEH. The length of DE can be calculated via Pythagoras: DA=3, AE=14, so DE = sqrt(3² + 14²) = sqrt(9+196)=sqrt(205). But wait, the problem mentions a square prism with sides 3cm, 3cm, and 14cm. So maybe the prisms are formed by extruding squares along the third dimension. 

But the main issue is angle D-F-H. Points D, F, H. Let me try to visualize the figure. 

First, let's note the coordinates. Assuming some coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to each point based on the given lengths and rectangles. 

Start with Rectangle(A,B,F,E). So A-B-F-E is a rectangle. Since AB=3, BE=... Wait, AB is 3, AF would be the other side. Wait, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB equals FE, and BF equals AE. Given that LengthOf(A,E,14), so AE=14. Thus, BF=14. Also, LengthOf(B,F,14) confirms that. So in rectangle ABFE, AB=3, BF=14. Similarly, other rectangles. 

Now, Rectangle(D,A,E,H): D-A-E-H. DA=3, AE=14, so DH and HE would be the other sides. Wait, since it's a rectangle, DA is perpendicular to AE. So DA is vertical, AE is horizontal. Then DH would be the same as AE? Or maybe not. Wait, in rectangle D-A-E-H, DA and AE are adjacent sides. So DA=3, AE=14. Therefore, DH should be equal to AE, so DH=14. Which matches the given LengthOf(D,H,14). And HE would be equal to DA, which is 3. But HE is part of the rectangle E-F-G-H, where HE=3 (since H-E is a side of the rectangle, and HE is 3). 

Now, considering point F. From Rectangle(B,C,G,F), so B-C-G-F. BC=3, CF=14. Since BF=14 (from earlier), and CF=BF? Wait, no. In rectangle BCGF, BC and GF are sides. Since BC=3, then GF=BC=3. Also, BG and CF are the other pair of sides. Wait, but BF is a diagonal? Or is BF a side? Wait, in rectangle BCGF, the sides are BC, CG, GF, FB. Wait, but Line(B,F) is given as a line, and LengthOf(B,F,14). So BF is a side of the rectangle BCGF. Therefore, BC=3, BF=14. Hence, in rectangle BCGF, BC and BF are adjacent sides, so they are perpendicular. Therefore, angle at B is a right angle. 

Similarly, for other rectangles. Now, moving to the prism. It's a square prism, so it's a cuboid with two square faces and four rectangular faces. However, the given dimensions are 3cm, 3cm, and 14cm. So two of the edges are 3cm (squares), and the third is 14cm. 

Assuming that the base is a square with sides 3cm, and height 14cm. But how does this fit with the given points?

Let me consider points D, E, F, H. We need to find angle D-F-H. Let me think about their coordinates. 

Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Let's set up a coordinate system. Let me place point A at (0,0,0). Since DA is 3 units, and assuming the rectangle D-A-E-H, DA is one side. Let me assume that DA is along the z-axis. Wait, but since it's a prism, maybe we need 3D coordinates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is a combination of two squares connected by rectangles. Let me think. 

Since there are rectangles involving points A,B,F,E; B,C,G,F; C,D,H,G; D,A,E,H; and E,F,G,H. These seem to form a three-dimensional shape. Let me imagine that the base is a square with points A,B,C,D, and another square at the top with points E,F,G,H, connected vertically. 

But given that the rectangles include D,A,E,H, which would connect the bottom corner D to top corner E. Similarly, other connections. 

Assuming that A, B, C, D form the base square with each side 3cm. Then E, F, G, H form the top square, shifted by 14cm in some direction. However, the connection between the bases would involve vertical edges of length 14cm. 

For example, line AE connects A to E, which is vertical, length 14cm. Similarly, BF connects B to F, length 14cm, and so on. 

So in this case, points A, B, C, D are the base square, each 3cm apart. Points E, F, G, H are directly above A, B, C, D respectively, forming the top square. But in this case, the distance between E and F would be 3cm, since they're connected by the edge EF. Wait, but in the given LengthOf(E,F,3) is true. So yes, EF is 3cm. 

However, the problem mentions a square prism with sides 3cm, 3cm, and 14cm. So the base is a square with sides 3cm, and the height is 14cm. So the lateral edges (like AE, BF, etc.) are 14cm. 

Now, the angle ∠DFH. Let me identify points D, F, H. 

Point D is a corner of the base square. Point F is part of the top square. Let me see: 

In the rectangle B,C,G,F, so B is connected to C to G to F to B. So F is the top corner corresponding to B. Similarly, E corresponds to A. 

Therefore, if A is (0,0,0), then E would be (0,0,14). Assuming the vertical axis is z. Then B would be (3,0,0), since AB=3. Then F would be (3,0,14). 

Point D is connected to A and C. Since ABCD is a square, D would be at (0,3,0) if A is (0,0,0), B is (3,0,0), C is (3,3,0), D is (0,3,0). 

Then, point H is part of rectangle D,A,E,H. So D is connected to A to E to H to D. Since A is (0,0,0), E is (0,0,14), then H would be (0, something, 14). Wait, because in rectangle D-A-E-H, DA is from D(0,3,0) to A(0,0,0), then AE is from A(0,0,0) to E(0,0,14). Then EH is from E(0,0,14) to H, and HD is from H to D(0,3,0). So to form a rectangle, the vector from E to H should be the same as the vector from A to D. Vector AD is (0,3,0) - (0,0,0) = (0,3,0). So EH should be the same vector. Starting from E(0,0,14), adding vector AD gives H = E + AD = (0,0,14) + (0,3,0) = (0,3,14). So H is at (0,3,14). 

Now, point F is (3,0,14) as per earlier. 

So points D(0,3,0), F(3,0,14), H(0,3,14). Now, we need to find the angle at F between points D, F, H. 

So angle DFH is the angle at point F between points D, F, H. 

To calculate this angle, we can use vectors. 

Vector FD is from F to D: D - F = (0-3, 3-0, 0-14) = (-3, 3, -14).

Vector FH is from F to H: H - F = (0-3, 3-0, 14-14) = (-3, 3, 0).

Now, the angle between vectors FD and FH is θ. 

Using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (FD · FH) / (|FD| |FH|)

Calculate the dot product:

FD · FH = (-3)(-3) + (3)(3) + (-14)(0) = 9 + 9 + 0 = 18.

|FD| = sqrt((-3)^2 + 3^2 + (-14)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9 + 196) = sqrt(214).

|FH| = sqrt((-3)^2 + 3^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18) = 3√2.

Thus,

cosθ = 18 / (sqrt(214)*3√2) = 6 / (sqrt(214)*√2) = 6 / sqrt(428) = 6 / (2*sqrt(107)) = 3 / sqrt(107).

Calculating this value numerically:

sqrt(107) ≈ 10.344.

So cosθ ≈ 3 / 10.344 ≈ 0.290.

Then θ ≈ arccos(0.290). 

Calculating arccos(0.29):

Using calculator, arccos(0.29) ≈ 73.0 degrees (approximate value). Wait, let me compute more accurately. 

Alternatively, using precise calculation:

Let me compute 3/sqrt(107):

sqrt(107) ≈ 10.34408.

3 divided by 10.34408 ≈ 0.290.

Now, arccos(0.29) is approximately 73.0 degrees. Let me verify:

cos(60°) = 0.5, cos(90°)=0. So 0.29 is between 60° and 90°. Let's compute:

cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420.

cos(73°) ≈ 0.2924.

Ah! So cos(73°) ≈ 0.2924, which is very close to our value of ~0.290. So θ ≈ 73 degrees. 

But let me check with precise calculation. Let me compute 3/sqrt(107):

Compute sqrt(107) ≈ 10.34408.

3 / 10.34408 ≈ 0.290. 

Now, arccos(0.29) is approx 73.0 degrees. However, depending on precise computation, it could be slightly different. Let me do a better approximation.

Let’s use the Taylor series or iterative method. Suppose we know that cos(73°) ≈ 0.2924. Our value is 0.290, which is slightly smaller. So angle is slightly larger than 73°. Let me compute:

Let’s take x = 73°, cos(x) = 0.2924.

We want to find θ such that cos(θ) = 0.29.

Let’s use linear approximation. Let’s suppose f(x) = cos(x). At x = 73°, f(x)=0.2924. Let’s find Δx such that f(x + Δx) = 0.29.

Approximately, f(x + Δx) ≈ f(x) - sin(x) * Δx (in radians).

Convert 73° to radians: 73 * π/180 ≈ 1.274 radians.

sin(73°) ≈ sin(1.274) ≈ 0.9563.

So 0.2924 - 0.9563 * Δx ≈ 0.29 → Δx ≈ (0.2924 - 0.29)/0.9563 ≈ 0.0024 / 0.9563 ≈ 0.0025 radians.

Convert 0.0025 radians to degrees: 0.0025 * (180/π) ≈ 0.0025 * 57.2958 ≈ 0.143°. 

So θ ≈ 73° + 0.143° ≈ 73.143°, which is approximately 73.14°. Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 73.14°. 

But let me confirm with actual computation using a calculator. However, since I don't have a calculator here, but given that the initial value was 3/sqrt(107), which is approximately 0.290, leading to arccos(0.290) ≈ 73.1°. 

But wait, the problem says that the measure of angle D-F-H is 0° according to the given predicates. But according to our calculation, it's around 73.1°, which contradicts the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0). This suggests a conflict. Where is the error?

Wait, the given predicates state MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0). But according to our calculation, it's not zero. This indicates a possible misunderstanding of the problem setup. Let me revisit the given predicates.

Looking back, the user included the following:

"MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0)" and "Angle(D,F,H)".

Also, there's "RightAngle(Angle(D,E,F))". So angle at E in triangle DEF is a right angle. 

Earlier, I thought that angle DEF is a right angle, which would make triangle DEF a right triangle with right angle at E. Therefore, DE and EF are the legs, and DF is the hypotenuse. 

Given that DE is the diagonal of rectangle DAEH, which has sides DA=3 and AE=14. So DE = sqrt(3² + 14²) = sqrt(205). EF is 3 cm (as per LengthOf(E,F,3)). 

Then DF, the hypotenuse, would be sqrt(DE² + EF²)? No, wait, in triangle DEF, right-angled at E, so DF² = DE² + EF². Wait, DE is sqrt(205), EF is 3. So DF² = 205 + 9 = 214. So DF = sqrt(214), which matches our previous calculation. 

But the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) suggests that angle D-F-H is 0°, implying colinearity. However, our calculation shows it's around 73.1°, which doesn't align. What's wrong here?

Perhaps there's a miscalculation in assigning coordinates. Let me double-check the coordinates. 

Points:

- A(0,0,0)
- B(3,0,0)
- C(3,3,0)
- D(0,3,0)
- E(0,0,14)
- F(3,0,14)
- G(3,3,14)
- H(0,3,14)

Wait, point H is supposed to be part of rectangle D-A-E-H. So from D(0,3,0) to A(0,0,0) to E(0,0,14) to H. To make a rectangle, the vector from E to H should be the same as the vector from A to D. Vector AD is (0,3,0). So vector EH should be (0,3,0). So starting from E(0,0,14), adding (0,3,0) gives H(0,3,14). Yes, that's correct. 

So point H is (0,3,14). Point F is (3,0,14). Point D is (0,3,0). 

Vectors FD and FH:

FD = D - F = (0-3, 3-0, 0-14) = (-3, 3, -14)

FH = H - F = (0-3, 3-0, 14-14) = (-3, 3, 0)

Dot product FD·FH = (-3)(-3) + (3)(3) + (-14)(0) = 9 + 9 + 0 = 18.

|FD| = sqrt(9 + 9 + 196) = sqrt(214)

|FH| = sqrt(9 + 9 + 0) = sqrt(18)

So cos(theta) = 18/(sqrt(214)*sqrt(18)) = 18/(sqrt(214*18)) = 18/sqrt(3852) = 18/sqrt(3852). Simplify sqrt(3852). Let's factor 3852: divide by 4: 3852/4=963. So sqrt(4*963)=2*sqrt(963). Thus, cos(theta)=18/(2*sqrt(963))=9/sqrt(963). Simplify sqrt(963): 963=9*107, so sqrt(9*107)=3*sqrt(107). Thus, cos(theta)=9/(3*sqrt(107))=3/sqrt(107)≈0.290, as before.

This suggests theta ≈73.1°, but the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) says it's 0°. This contradiction implies an error in my understanding of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the angle is not the angle between vectors FD and FH, but rather the angle at F between FD and FH, which is the angle between FD and FH. However, the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) suggests it's zero. How is this possible?

Maybe there's a miscalculation in the coordinates. Let me check if points D, F, H are colinear. If they are, then angle D-F-H is 0°, but according to coordinates, they are not. Let me check if points D, F, H lie on the same line. 

Coordinates:

D(0,3,0), F(3,0,14), H(0,3,14).

Check if these are colinear. For three points to be colinear, the vectors DF and DH must be scalar multiples. 

Vector DF = F - D = (3-0, 0-3, 14-0) = (3, -3, 14)

Vector DH = H - D = (0-0, 3-3, 14-0) = (0, 0, 14)

Are these scalar multiples? For them to be scalar multiples, there exists k such that 3 = k*0, -3 = k*0, 14 = k*14. The first equation implies k is undefined (since 3=0*k), which is impossible. Therefore, points D, F, H are not colinear, so angle D-F-H is not zero. Hence, the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) must be incorrect or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, but the user included "MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0)" as a predicate. This suggests that according to the problem's setup, the angle is zero. This implies that my coordinate assignment is wrong. 

Alternative possibility: Perhaps the prism is not aligned as I assumed. Maybe the edges AE, BF, etc., are not vertical. Let me reconsider the structure. 

Another approach: Since the problem involves a square prism, which is a cuboid with two square faces. The sides are 3cm, 3cm, and 14cm. So two of the dimensions are 3cm, and the third is 14cm. This suggests that the prism has square bases with side 3cm, and the height is 14cm. 

In this case, the edges connecting the bases (like AE, BF, etc.) are all 14cm. 

Now, the angle ∠DFH: points D, F, H. Let me think about their positions. 

Assume that the base square is ABCD with AB=3, BC=3, CD=3, DA=3. The top square is EFGH, with EF=3, FG=3, GH=3, HE=3. The vertical edges are AE=14, BF=14, CG=14, DH=14. 

Now, point D is one corner of the base square. Point F is the top corner corresponding to B. Point H is the top corner corresponding to A. 

Wait, if EFGH is the top square, then the correspondence would be A→E, B→F, C→G, D→H. Because the rectangles are defined as follows:

- Rectangle(A,B,F,E): connects A to B to F to E to A. So B→F and A→E are vertical edges. So F is directly above B, and E is directly above A. Hence, H is directly above D. 

So in this case, D is at the base, and H is directly above D. So DH is a vertical edge of length 14. 

Now, point F is directly above B. So coordinates:

Let me assign coordinates again, assuming 3D space:

Let me set A at (0, 0, 0). Since AB=3, and assuming AB is along x-axis: B(3, 0, 0). Since ABCD is a square, C(3, 3, 0), D(0, 3, 0). 

Top square EFGH: E is above A, so E(0, 0, 14). F is above B: F(3, 0, 14). G is above C: G(3, 3, 14). H is above D: H(0, 3, 14). 

Now, points D(0,3,0), F(3,0,14), H(0,3,14). 

So vectors FD and FH:

FD: from F(3,0,14) to D(0,3,0): (-3, 3, -14)

FH: from F(3,0,14) to H(0,3,14): (-3, 3, 0)

Same as before. So angle between these vectors is still ~73.1°, which contradicts the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0). 

But the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) suggests that this angle is 0°. This inconsistency implies that either the problem statement has errors, or there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is not the angle at F, but at H? Or perhaps there's a typo in the angle notation. The question asks for ∠DFH, which is the angle at F between points D, F, H. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is a straight angle, but the given measure is 0°, which might indicate a reflex angle. But normally, angles in such contexts are taken as the smallest positive angle between the vectors, so between 0° and 180°. 

Alternatively, maybe the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) refers to a different angle. Let me check if there's any other angle involving D-F-H that could be zero. 

For instance, if points D, F, H are colinear, then the angle would be 0° or 180°. But according to our coordinates, they are not. 

Wait, let me check if there's any other relationship. The problem mentions that there's a RightAngle(Angle(D,E,F)), which is the angle at E in triangle DEF. So in triangle DEF, right-angled at E. 

Which means that DE is perpendicular to EF. Let me confirm this with coordinates. 

DE is from D(0,3,0) to E(0,0,14). Vector DE = (0-0, 0-3, 14-0) = (0, -3, 14).

EF is from E(0,0,14) to F(3,0,14). Vector EF = (3-0, 0-0, 14-14) = (3, 0, 0).

Dot product of DE and EF: (0)(3) + (-3)(0) + (14)(0) = 0. So they are perpendicular, confirming the right angle at E. 

So everything checks out except for the angle at F. 

Given that the problem states MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0), but our calculation shows it's around 73°, there's a contradiction. This suggests that either the problem contains a mistake, or there's a different configuration. 

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the angle is not in 3D space but in 2D. But the presence of a prism suggests 3D. However, if the diagram is projected onto 2D, maybe the angle appears differently. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is referring to a different angle. Let me re-examine the predicates. 

One of the predicates is "Angle(D,F,H)", and "MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0)". This suggests that the angle is zero. But according to the coordinates, it's not. 

Unless there's a miscalculation in the vector approach. Let me recalculate the angle. 

Vectors FD and FH:

FD = D - F = (0-3, 3-0, 0-14) = (-3, 3, -14)

FH = H - F = (0-3, 3-0, 14-14) = (-3, 3, 0)

Dot product FD · FH = (-3)(-3) + (3)(3) + (-14)(0) = 9 + 9 + 0 = 18.

Magnitude of FD: sqrt((-3)^2 + 3^2 + (-14)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9 + 196) = sqrt(214) ≈ 14.628.

Magnitude of FH: sqrt((-3)^2 + 3^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426.

So cos(theta) = 18 / (14.628 * 4.2426) ≈ 18 / (62.0) ≈ 0.2903.

As before, this leads to theta ≈ 73.1°. 

But the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) says it's 0°. This suggests that either the problem has conflicting information, or there's a misunderstanding. 

Wait, perhaps the angle is actually a straight line, and the measure is 180°, but due to some convention, it's represented as 0°? Like in some contexts, angles wrap around, but that's non-standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is measured in a different way. For example, if the angle is between FD and FH in a certain plane, but in 3D space, the angle between two lines is determined by their direction vectors. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's predicates, and the intended measure is 90°, or another value. 

Given that the problem asks for theta, and the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) is conflicting, but based on the geometric configuration, the calculated angle is approximately 73.1°, which would round to 73.14°, and to two decimal places, it would be 73.14°. 

However, without resolving the discrepancy in the given predicates, this is the best estimate. Hence, the answer is approximately 73.14°, which would be the Final Answer: A, B, C, or D depending on options. But since the user said "No choices found," perhaps the answer is expected to be 73.14°, and the correct choice is not listed, but since the user instructed to choose from A-D, but no choices are given, perhaps the intended answer is 73.14°, which rounds to 73.14. But since the user didn't provide choices, and the instruction says to select from A-D, but no options, it's unclear. However, the original problem may have had choices, but the user removed them. 

Assuming that the correct answer is approximately 73.14°, and the given options might include this, but since the user hasn't provided them, I'll proceed with the calculation. 

Thus, the final answer is approximately 73.14°, which to two decimal places is 73.14. So the answer is 73.14, but since the user wants the letter choice, and assuming that the correct answer is among A-D, but since no choices are given, I'm forced to conclude based on the calculation. 

But since the user said "No choices found," perhaps the intended answer is 73.14°, and the correct choice is not available. However, following the instructions, I must provide a letter. Given that the calculation is approximately 73.14°, and if the options were A: 73.14°, then the answer would be A. But since no options are given, I'll assume that the correct answer is 73.14°, and the required format is to choose a letter. Since the user's last message says "No choices found," but the task requires selecting from A-D, I'll have to make an educated guess. However, this is uncertain. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angle is zero due to some other configuration. Let me recheck. 

If the angle is zero, then vectors FD and FH are in the same direction. But in our calculation, they aren't. Unless there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me recompute the vectors. 

FD: from F to D: D - F = (0-3, 3-0, 0-14) = (-3, 3, -14)

FH: from F to H: H - F = (0-3, 3-0, 14-14) = (-3, 3, 0)

These vectors are not scalar multiples, so not collinear. Hence, the angle cannot be zero. 

Therefore, the given MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) must be erroneous, and the correct answer is approximately 73.14°, which would be the Final Answer: A if it's option A. But since no choices are given, I'm unsure. However, based on the calculation, the answer is approximately 73.14°, and the user's instructions say to select from A-D. Assuming that the correct answer is among them, and if I had to choose based on the calculation, I'd say it's approximately 73.14°, and if one of the choices is this, then select it. Since the user didn't provide choices, but the original problem might have had options, I'll proceed with the calculation.
