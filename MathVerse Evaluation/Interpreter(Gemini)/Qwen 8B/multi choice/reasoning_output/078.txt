MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand all the given information and what's being asked. Let me start by restating the problem in my own words.

We have points A, B, C, D, and E. Lines AB and CD are parallel. There's a line AE that bisects angle CAB and intersects CD at point E. Also, angle C measures 70 degrees. The question is asking for the measure of angle AED.

Let me visualize this. Since AB is parallel to CD, maybe there are some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles involved. Also, since AE is an angle bisector, it splits angle CAB into two equal parts. Point E lies on CD, so connecting A to E creates triangle AED, and we need to find angle AED.

First, I should note down all the given predicates again to make sure I don't miss anything:

- Points A, B, C, D, E.
- Line AB and Line CD are parallel.
- Line AE exists.
- Angle C is 70 degrees.
- Line AE bisects angle CAB (so angle CAE equals angle EAB).
- Point E lies on line CD.

Wait, angle C is mentioned here. But angle C would typically refer to angle at point C. However, in standard notation, angle ABC would be angle at point B. So angle C here probably refers to angle at point C in triangle ABC? Wait, but where is point C located?

Hmm, perhaps there's a triangle involving point C. Let me think. If AB is parallel to CD, then maybe points A, B are connected to C and D? Or perhaps there's a transversal cutting the parallel lines AB and CD. Since AE is a line from A to E on CD, which is part of line CD.

Maybe it's helpful to draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me imagine AB as a horizontal line, with A on the left and B on the right. Then CD is another horizontal line, parallel to AB. Now, point E is where AE meets CD. So AE starts at A, goes through E on CD. Also, angle C is 70 degrees. Assuming angle C is part of triangle ABC or something else.

Wait, angle C could be angle at point C. If AB is parallel to CD, then maybe there's a triangle involving point C. For example, if we consider triangle ACD or something. Alternatively, maybe there's a quadrilateral ABCD with AB || CD. But without more info, it's hard to say. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram based on the given elements.

Since AE bisects angle CAB, angle CAE equals angle EAB. Also, E is on CD. So line AE is acting as an angle bisector of angle CAB, intersecting CD at E. Therefore, perhaps triangle ABC has AB as one side, and AE is the bisector of angle at A. But where is point C located? Maybe point C is on line CD? Because CD is parallel to AB, and E is on CD.

Alternatively, maybe points C and D are such that CD is parallel to AB, and line AE connects A to E on CD. So, AB || CD, and AE is an angle bisector of angle CAB. So, angle CAB is split into two equal parts by AE. Let me focus on that.

Let me denote angle CAB as angle at point A between CA and AB. Since AE bisects this angle, then angle CAE = angle EAB = half of angle CAB. Also, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, maybe there are some angle relationships here.

But how does angle C come into play? The problem says MeasureOf(Angle(C),70.0). So angle C is 70 degrees. If angle C is part of triangle ABC, then angle at point C. Let me assume that triangle ABC has vertices A, B, C, with AB as one side, BC as another, and AC as the third. Then angle at C is 70 degrees.

So in triangle ABC, angle at C is 70 degrees. Also, AE bisects angle CAB. Let me try to write down the variables.

Let me assign labels. Let’s suppose AB is a horizontal line, with A on the left and B on the right. Point C is somewhere such that line CD is parallel to AB. Since CD is parallel to AB, and E is on CD. Also, AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB.

So, angle CAB is the angle at point A between CA and AB. Let me denote angle CAB as α. Then AE bisects it into two angles each of measure α/2.

Now, considering line AE intersects CD at E. Since AB || CD, then maybe there are some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles formed by the transversal AE.

Also, angle at C is 70 degrees. In triangle ABC, angles sum up to 180 degrees. So angle at A (angle CAB) + angle at B + angle at C = 180. We know angle C is 70 degrees, but we don't know angles at A or B yet.

But wait, since AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB, maybe we can relate angles in triangle AEC or AEB. Also, because AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, the angle between AE and AB would correspond to the angle between AE and CD, due to the parallel lines.

Alternatively, maybe triangle AED is involved. Our goal is to find angle AED.

Let me think about triangle AED. To find angle AED, we need to know other angles in that triangle or use some properties.

Alternatively, since E is on CD, which is parallel to AB, maybe there's a way to relate angles via parallel lines and transversals.

Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, in triangle ABC, angle at C is 70 degrees. Let me denote angle CAB as α, angle ABC as β, angle ACB as γ=70°. So α + β + γ = 180 → α + β = 110°.

AE bisects angle CAB, so angle CAE = α/2, and angle EAB = α/2.

Now, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the angle between AE and AB (which is angle EAB = α/2) corresponds to the angle between AE and CD. Wait, but E is on CD, so the angle between AE and CD at point E would be equal to angle EAB because of the parallel lines. That is, angle between AE and CD (at point E) is equal to angle EAB, which is α/2.

Therefore, angle AED is supplementary to that angle? Wait, let's see. At point E, line AE forms an angle with CD. Since CD is parallel to AB, and AE is a transversal, the angle between AE and CD is equal to the angle between AE and AB (since they're corresponding angles). So, angle between AE and CD (at E) is equal to angle EAB = α/2. 

But angle AED is adjacent to that angle along line CD. Let me clarify. At point E, we have line CD and line AE. So angle between AE and CD at E is angle AED? Wait, no. Let me get the notation right.

Point E is on CD. So line CD passes through E. From E, there's line AE going to A. So at point E, the lines are CD (going from D to C, passing through E) and AE (from E to A). Therefore, angle AED is the angle at point E between ED and EA. So, angle AED is formed by ED (part of CD) and EA.

Since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the angle between AE and AB (which is angle EAB = α/2) is equal to the angle between AE and CD (which is angle between AE and CD at E). This angle would be equal to angle EAB because of the parallel lines. So that angle is α/2. Therefore, in triangle AED, angle at E (angle AED) is supplementary to that angle if they form a linear pair. Wait, but depending on the direction.

Wait, if AB is parallel to CD, and AE is a transversal, then the angle between AE and AB (on the AB side) is equal to the angle between AE and CD on the CD side. But since E is on CD, the angle between AE and CD at E is equal to angle EAB. But how does that relate to angle AED?

Let me think. Imagine standing at point E, looking along CD towards D. The line AE comes from A to E. The angle between AE and CD at E is the same as angle between AE and AB, which is α/2. However, angle AED is the angle between ED (along CD) and EA. So that angle is equal to α/2. Wait, but that would mean angle AED = α/2. But that seems too straightforward. However, I need to check if that's accurate.

Wait, no. Because if AB is parallel to CD, and AE is a transversal, then the corresponding angles are equal. The angle between AE and AB at A is angle EAB, which is α/2. The corresponding angle on line CD would be the angle between AE and CD at E. So that angle would also be α/2. Therefore, angle between AE and CD at E is α/2. But angle AED is that same angle, so angle AED = α/2. Is that correct?

Wait, but angle AED is at point E between ED and EA. So yes, that angle is equal to α/2. So angle AED = α/2. But we need to find its measure. But we don't know α yet. How do we find α?

In triangle ABC, we have angles α (at A), β (at B), and γ = 70° at C. So α + β + 70° = 180° → α + β = 110°. But we need another equation to find α. Perhaps we can find β?

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship involving angle at E or something else.

Wait, since AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB, and E lies on CD, which is parallel to AB. Maybe we can use the property of angle bisectors and parallel lines to find relations between the sides or other angles.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that angle at E relates to other angles.

Wait, let me consider triangle AEC. In triangle AEC, we have angle at A is α/2 (because AE is the bisector), angle at C is 70°, and angle at E is... Well, if we can find those angles, maybe we can find some relations.

But I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Another approach: Since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the angle between AE and AB (α/2) is equal to the angle between AE and CD (same as above). But angle AED is that same angle, so angle AED = α/2. Therefore, if we can find α, we can find angle AED.

But how to find α?

Looking back at triangle ABC. Let me recall that angle at C is 70°, and angle CAB is α. If we can express β (angle at B) in terms of α, perhaps using some other relationships.

But without knowing more about the triangle, like side lengths or other angles, it's tricky. Unless there's something else.

Wait, maybe there's a relation through the line CD. Since E is on CD, and AB || CD, maybe we can use some proportionality or similar triangles.

Wait, since AE is an angle bisector, maybe the ratio of AB to AC is related to BE/EC? Wait, no, that's the angle bisector theorem, which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But in this case, AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB, so according to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of AB to AC is equal to the ratio of BE to EC. Wait, but E is on CD, not necessarily on BC. Hmm, that complicates things. Because the angle bisector theorem applies when the bisector meets the opposite side. Here, the bisector AE meets CD, not BC. So maybe that theorem isn't directly applicable here.

Alternative idea: Since AB || CD, the distance between AB and CD is constant. However, I don't see how that helps immediately.

Wait, perhaps considering triangle AED and triangle something else. Or using exterior angles.

Wait, maybe focusing on triangle AED. Let's think about what we know about it.

At point E, angle AED is what we want. Also, angle at E is α/2 as discussed earlier. What about the other angles in triangle AED?

We need to find angle AED, which requires knowledge of other angles in triangle AED. Let me think about the other angles.

In triangle AED, the angles are at A, E, and D. We know angle at E is α/2. What about angle at A? It's part of angle CAB, which was bisected by AE. So angle at A in triangle AED is angle EAD, which is angle between EA and AD. Wait, but AD isn't defined yet. Hmm, this seems confusing.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle AEC. In triangle AEC, we have angle at A is α/2, angle at C is 70°, and angle at E is ?

Sum of angles in triangle is 180°, so angle at E in triangle AEC is 180° - (α/2 + 70°). So angle AEC = 180° - α/2 - 70° = 110° - α/2.

But angle AEC is adjacent to angle AED? Wait, point E is on CD. So if we look at angles around point E, there's angle AEC and angle AED. Are these supplementary?

Yes! Because points C, E, D are colinear (since E is on CD), so angles AEC and AED form a straight line. Therefore, angle AEC + angle AED = 180°.

From earlier, angle AEC = 110° - α/2, and angle AED = ? So:

angle AED = 180° - angle AEC = 180° - (110° - α/2) = 70° + α/2.

So angle AED = 70° + α/2.

But we need to find angle AED, so we need to find α.

How to find α? Recall that in triangle ABC, α + β + 70° = 180° ⇒ α + β = 110°. But we need another equation involving α and β.

Is there a way to relate α and β? Let me think. Since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, maybe there are some alternate interior angles or something else.

Wait, when AE intersects CD at E, and AB || CD, then the alternate interior angles would be equal. Let me consider the transversal AE crossing AB and CD. The alternate interior angles would be angle between AE and AB (which is angle EAB = α/2) and the angle between AE and CD on the other side. But since E is on CD, that angle would be angle between AE and DC. Wait, but that depends on the direction of AE.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angle at B and angle at E?

Alternatively, since AE is the angle bisector, and AB || CD, maybe there's some similarity or proportionality.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ABD or something else.

Wait, let's think about triangle ABE. Not sure.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, then angle between AE and AB (α/2) is equal to angle between AE and CD, which we've already considered.

Wait, but earlier we had angle AED = 70° + α/2. If we can express α in terms of other known angles.

Wait, in triangle ABC, we know angle at C is 70°, but we don't know angles at A or B. However, maybe there's another relationship involving angle at B.

Wait, since AB || CD, and assuming that line BC is a transversal, then angle at B and some other angle could be related. But without knowing where point D is, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle ACD. If we can find some angles there.

Alternatively, since AE bisects angle CAB, and E is on CD, maybe applying Menelaus' theorem or something similar.

Wait, Menelaus’ theorem involves a transversal cutting through a triangle. Maybe not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, using coordinates. Assign coordinates to the points and calculate.

Let me try that approach. Let me place point A at origin (0,0), AB along x-axis. Let me assume AB is horizontal. Let me define coordinates:

Let’s set coordinate system:

Let’s take A at (0,0).

Let’s assume AB is along the x-axis, so B is at (b, 0) for some b > 0.

Since AB || CD, then CD is also horizontal. Let’s assume CD is at some y-coordinate, say k. So points C and D lie on the line y = k.

But where exactly? Let me think. Since E is on CD, and AE connects A(0,0) to E on CD.

But we need to find coordinates of C and D such that AB || CD, and AE bisects angle CAB.

Additionally, angle at C is 70 degrees. Let me assume that point C is somewhere, forming triangle ABC with angle at C being 70 degrees.

This might get complicated, but let's try.

Let me proceed step by step.

Set A at (0,0), B at (1,0) for simplicity. Let me choose AB length as 1 unit for easier calculation.

Now, angle CAB is the angle at A between CA and AB. Since AE bisects this angle, and E is on CD.

Assume point C has coordinates (p, q), and point D is somewhere on the line parallel to AB (y=k). Since AB is horizontal, CD is also horizontal, so CD is y = k.

But since E is on CD, which is horizontal. Also, AE connects A(0,0) to E(x, k), where E lies on CD.

But need to ensure that angle at C is 70 degrees.

This seems complex, but perhaps manageable.

First, let me define point C. Suppose point C is somewhere in the plane. Given that AB is from (0,0) to (1,0), and angle at C is 70 degrees.

But without knowing more about triangle ABC, it's challenging. However, maybe I can express vectors or slopes.

Alternatively, since AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB, we can use the angle bisector formula.

But in order to use that, we need to know the direction of AE.

Let me think. The angle bisector of angle CAB would divide the angle between CA and AB. So if I can find the slope of AE, it would depend on the direction of CA.

Alternatively, since AB is along x-axis, and angle CAB is the angle between CA and AB. Let me assume that point C is such that line AC makes some angle with AB.

Let me suppose that angle CAB is α, so angle between CA and AB is α. Then, the bisector AE divides it into two angles of α/2.

If I can find coordinates of E, which lies on CD, and CD is parallel to AB (horizontal), then E has coordinates (e_x, k) for some e_x and k.

But I need to connect this with angle at C being 70 degrees.

This might require more variables than I can handle without additional constraints. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, going back to the previous equations. Earlier, we found angle AED = 70° + α/2. And in triangle ABC, α + β = 110°, where β is angle at B. But unless we can find another relation between α and β, we can't determine α.

But maybe there's another relationship from the parallel lines and the transversal AE.

Earlier, I thought about the angle between AE and CD being equal to α/2 (corresponding angle). But since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, the corresponding angles would be equal. So angle between AE and AB (at A) equals angle between AE and CD (at E). Which we said is α/2. But angle at E is part of triangle AED, and we have angle AED = 70° + α/2.

But we still need another equation. Wait, perhaps considering triangle AEC and triangle something else.

Wait, in triangle AEC, we had angle at E as 110° - α/2. And angle AEC + angle AED = 180°, leading to angle AED = 70° + α/2.

But if we can find another expression for angle AED, maybe through other means.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would involve angles at A and E. Wait, but AE is not a transversal between AB and CD; it starts at A, which is on AB, and ends at E on CD. So it's a transversal that starts on AB and ends on CD. Hence, the alternate interior angles would be angle between AE and AB (α/2) and the angle between AE and CD on the other side. Wait, but since E is on CD, the alternate interior angle would be the angle between AE and CD on the side opposite to AB. But since CD is parallel to AB, that angle would be equal to α/2.

However, that angle is the same as angle between AE and CD at E, which we already considered as α/2. But how does that help us?

Wait, but angle between AE and CD at E is equal to angle between AE and AB at A, which is α/2. But that angle is part of triangle AED. Wait, maybe that's not helping directly.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle AED and using the fact that angle at E is α/2, and trying to find other angles.

Wait, I'm stuck here. Let me go back to the earlier equation: angle AED = 70° + α/2. If I can find α, I can compute angle AED.

To find α, let's think about triangle ABC. We know angle at C is 70°, and angles at A and B sum to 110°. If we can find another relationship involving α and β.

Perhaps using the fact that AE is the angle bisector and E lies on CD, which is parallel to AB. Maybe using the concept of similar triangles or some proportion.

Let me think about the line AE. Since AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB, and E lies on CD, which is parallel to AB. Perhaps there's a way to relate the ratios of segments.

Using the angle bisector theorem: in triangle ABC, if AE is the bisector of angle A, then it divides BC into segments proportional to AB and AC. But in this case, AE doesn't meet BC, it meets CD instead. So the angle bisector theorem may not apply directly.

But maybe we can extend some ideas. Let me consider extending AE to meet BC at some point, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, since CD is parallel to AB, and E is on CD, maybe there's a way to relate the lengths.

Alternatively, consider drawing a line from E parallel to AB, but not sure.

Wait, here's an idea: since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the ratio of AE to something might be determined by the angle bisector.

Alternatively, since angle at C is 70°, and we have triangle ABC, maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines.

In triangle ABC, by the Law of Sines:

AB / sin(angle at C) = AC / sin(angle at B) = BC / sin(angle at A)

So AB / sin(70°) = AC / sin(β) = BC / sin(α)

But without knowing any side lengths, this might not be directly helpful. However, if we assume some lengths for simplicity, maybe we can proceed.

Let me assume AB = 1 (as before), then:

AB / sin(70°) = 1 / sin(70°) = AC / sin(β) => AC = sin(β)/sin(70°)

Similarly, BC = sin(α)/sin(70°)

But I don't know if this helps. Let me think about the angle bisector AE. The angle bisector divides angle A into two equal parts, and its length can be expressed in terms of the sides. But since E is not on BC but on CD, it's unclear.

Alternatively, since AE is an angle bisector, and E lies on CD, which is parallel to AB, perhaps there's a way to relate the angles at E with the angles in triangle ABC.

Wait, returning to the earlier equation angle AED = 70° + α/2. If I can express α in terms of known quantities.

Wait, angle at C is 70°, which is angle ACB. In triangle ABC, angle at C is 70°, so maybe using the Law of Sines:

AB / sin(angle ACB) = AC / sin(angle ABC) = BC / sin(angle BAC)

Let me denote AB = c, BC = a, AC = b.

Then, by Law of Sines:

a / sin(angle BAC) = b / sin(angle ABC) = c / sin(70°)

But angle BAC = α, angle ABC = β, and α + β = 110°, as before.

But without additional information, this seems insufficient.

Wait, but maybe considering the position of point E and the parallel lines. Since CD is parallel to AB, and E is on CD, maybe there's a way to relate the angles at E with angles in triangle ABC.

Alternatively, let's think about the entire diagram. Since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, creating corresponding angles. We know angle between AE and AB is α/2, which equals angle between AE and CD at E. So that angle is α/2.

Now, at point E, we have line CD and line AE. The angle between AE and CD at E is α/2. Also, since CD is parallel to AB, and AE is a transversal, the angle between AE and CD is equal to the angle between AE and AB, which is α/2.

But what about the other angles at E? Like, if I consider line EC, which connects E to C. Since C is a point such that angle at C is 70°, maybe there's a relationship between angle at C and other angles.

Wait, in triangle ACE, we have angle at C is 70°, angle at A is α/2, and angle at E is 180° - α/2 - 70° = 110° - α/2, as before. And this angle at E (angle AEC) is supplementary to angle AED, giving angle AED = 70° + α/2.

But how to find α?

Maybe by considering triangle AED and some other triangle.

Alternatively, let's consider that in triangle AED, if we can find two angles, we can find the third.

But we know angle at E is 70° + α/2, and angle at A is... Wait, angle at A in triangle AED is angle between EA and DA. But DA is part of CD, since D is on CD. Wait, but we don't know where D is.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, maybe angle between DA and AE is related to some other angle.

This seems too vague. Let me think differently. Maybe there's a way to express α in terms of other known angles.

Wait, if I consider the entire diagram, and the fact that angle at C is 70°, maybe there's a way to relate it to angle AED through some cyclic quadrilateral or something else.

Alternatively, since angle AED = 70° + α/2, and we need to find angle AED, maybe there's a way to find α using the fact that the sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180°, and some other condition.

Wait, let's assume that angle AED is what we're trying to find, and we need to find it in terms of known quantities. If we can find α, we can substitute.

But how? Let me think about the possibility that angle AED is 180° minus some other angle.

Wait, earlier we had angle AED = 70° + α/2. If I can find another expression for angle AED, I can set them equal.

For example, maybe angle AED is related to angle at C or something else.

Alternatively, since angle AED is formed by AE and ED, and ED is part of CD which is parallel to AB, perhaps there's a way to relate it to angle at B.

Wait, let me consider the straight line CD. Since AB || CD, and AE intersects CD at E, maybe there's a way to relate angles at E with angles at B.

Alternatively, maybe considering the triangle ABE or something.

Wait, I'm running out of ideas. Let me revisit the earlier equations.

From triangle ABC: α + β = 110°.

From triangle AEC: angle AEC = 110° - α/2.

From straight line at E: angle AEC + angle AED = 180° ⇒ angle AED = 180° - angle AEC = 180° - (110° - α/2) = 70° + α/2.

So angle AED = 70° + α/2.

If I can find α, then I can calculate angle AED.

But how?

Let me think: since AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB (α), and E lies on CD, which is parallel to AB, maybe there's a way to relate α with the angle at C (70°).

Wait, consider triangle ACE. We have angle at C is 70°, angle at A is α/2, angle at E is 110° - α/2. Now, if I can relate this with some other triangle.

Alternatively, since CD is parallel to AB, and AE is a transversal, then the angle between AE and CD (at E) is α/2, as established. Also, since CD is parallel to AB, and if we consider line EC, which connects E to C, then maybe there's a relationship between angle at C and angle at E.

Wait, in triangle ACE, we have angle at C is 70°, angle at E is 110° - α/2. If I can find another angle in this triangle, maybe relating to line EC.

But I don't see a direct connection.

Wait, but what if we consider the line EC? Since CD is parallel to AB, and E is on CD, then line EC is a transversal. Maybe there's some relationship between angles.

Alternatively, think about the fact that in triangle ABC, angle at C is 70°, and if we can express α in terms of β, and then use some other relationship.

From earlier, α + β = 110°. If I can find another equation involving α and β, I can solve for α.

Let me consider the line AE, which is the angle bisector of α. Since E is on CD, and CD is parallel to AB, perhaps there's a way to relate β with α.

Wait, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, the angle between AE and AB (α/2) is equal to the angle between AE and CD at E (also α/2). Now, if I consider line EC, which connects E to C, and since CD is parallel to AB, maybe there's a relationship between angle at C and some other angle.

Wait, at point C, we have angle ACB = 70°. Let me think about triangle ECB or something.

Alternatively, consider extending CE to meet AB at some point, but not sure.

Wait, here's an idea: since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would be equal. Let me consider the line AE intersecting AB and CD. The alternate interior angle to angle EAB (which is α/2) would be the angle between AE and CD on the other side of AE. But since E is on CD, this angle would be the angle between AE and CD at E, which is α/2, as before. This doesn't give new information.

Alternatively, maybe considering the exterior angle at E.

Wait, at point E, angle AED is part of the straight line CD, and angle between AE and CD is α/2. If I can relate this to other angles.

Wait, if I consider triangle ECD, but I don't know much about it.

I'm really stuck here. Let me think about possible assumptions or special cases.

Suppose angle CAB is 60°, then α = 60°, so angle AED = 70° + 30° = 100°. But this is just a guess, and not helpful.

Alternatively, if angle CAB is 80°, then angle AED = 70° + 40° = 110°, which is option A. But this is arbitrary.

Wait, but the answer choices are A:110°, B:125°, C:135°, D:140°. If I can find that angle AED = 110°, then answer is A.

But why would it be 110°? Let me think: if angle AED = 70° + α/2, and if α is 80°, then it's 110°. But how to justify α being 80°?

Wait, if I assume that angle at B is 30°, then α = 110° - β = 110° - 30° = 80°, making angle AED = 70 + 40 = 110°. But how to justify β being 30°?

Unless there's a reason why β = 30°. But without additional info, this is arbitrary.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate β with α through the parallel lines.

Since AB || CD, and line EC is a transversal, then angle between EC and AB is equal to the angle between EC and CD. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and EC is a transval, then angle at E on CD (between EC and CD) is equal to angle at B on AB (between EC and AB). But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me try this: since AB || CD, and line EC is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would be equal. The angle between EC and AB at B is equal to the angle between EC and CD at E.

Let me denote angle at B as β. Then, the angle between EC and AB at B is β. But since AB || CD, the alternate interior angle at E would be the angle between EC and CD at E. So, angle between EC and CD at E is β.

But earlier, we had that angle between AE and CD at E is α/2. So, if I can relate β and α.

Wait, at point E, the angle between EC and CD is β, and the angle between AE and CD is α/2. These angles are adjacent, forming a larger angle at E. Let me see:

At point E, on line CD, we have two lines: AE and EC. The angle between AE and CD is α/2, and the angle between EC and CD is β. So, the total angle at E between AE and EC is α/2 + β.

But what is this angle? It's the angle AEC, which we previously calculated as 110° - α/2.

So, angle AEC = α/2 + β = 110° - α/2.

Thus:

α/2 + β = 110° - α/2

=> β = 110° - α/2 - α/2 = 110° - α

But from earlier, we had α + β = 110°, so substituting β = 110° - α into this gives:

α + (110° - α) = 110°, which checks out. So this doesn't provide new information.

But this shows that our assumption is consistent, but doesn't help us find α.

Hmm. So this approach leads back to the same equation.

Wait, but we also have from the earlier equation that angle AEC = α/2 + β = 110° - α/2. And from this, we have β = 110° - α.

But we also know from triangle ABC that α + β = 110°, which is the same as β = 110° - α. So, this is redundant.

So, this suggests that we need another equation to solve for α.

But where can we get that equation?

Maybe from the fact that angle at C is 70°, and some relationship involving triangle ACE or other triangle.

In triangle ACE, we have angles:

At A: α/2

At C: 70°

At E: 110° - α/2

But also, in triangle ACE, the sides are related by the Law of Sines:

AC / sin(angle AEC) = AE / sin(angle C) = EC / sin(angle CAE)

So:

AC / sin(110° - α/2) = AE / sin(70°) = EC / sin(α/2)

But without knowing any side lengths, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, since CD is parallel to AB, and AE is a transversal, perhaps there's a proportionality between segments.

Wait, let me think about the coordinates approach again, but more carefully.

Let me set A at (0,0), B at (1,0), and assume AB is horizontal. Let me choose coordinates for point C such that angle at C is 70°.

Let me assume point C is at (p, q). Then, vector CA is from C to A: (0-p, 0-q) = (-p, -q). Vector CB is from C to B: (1-p, -q).

The angle at C is between vectors CB and CA. The angle between vectors CB and CA is 70 degrees.

The formula for the angle between two vectors u and v is:

cosθ = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)

So, cos(70°) = [(CB · CA)] / (|CB| |CA|)

Compute CB · CA = (1-p)(-p) + (-q)(-q) = -p(1-p) + q²

|CB| = sqrt((1-p)^2 + q^2)

|CA| = sqrt(p^2 + q^2)

This gives:

[ -p(1-p) + q² ] / [ sqrt((1-p)^2 + q^2) * sqrt(p^2 + q^2) ) ] = cos(70°)

This seems very complex, but perhaps choosing specific values for p and q could simplify things. Let me assume some simple coordinates for C.

Let me assume that point C is at (0,1), making CA vertical. Then, vector CA is from C(0,1) to A(0,0): (0-0, 0-1) = (0,-1). Vector CB is from C(0,1) to B(1,0): (1-0, 0-1) = (1,-1).

The angle at C is between vectors CA (downward vertical) and CB (diagonal).

Let me calculate this angle.

Vector CA: (0,-1)

Vector CB: (1,-1)

Dot product: (0)(1) + (-1)(-1) = 1

|CA| = 1

|CB| = sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2)

So cos(theta) = 1 / (1 * sqrt(2)) = 1/√2 ≈ 0.7071, which corresponds to theta = 45°, but we need theta to be 70°. So this choice of C doesn't work.

Let me try another point. Let me assume point C is at (c, d), and try to satisfy the angle condition.

But this might take too long. Let me think differently.

Since angle at C is 70°, and AB || CD, maybe there's a way to relate this angle with other angles in the diagram.

Wait, if I consider triangle ABC and the parallel lines, perhaps there's a way to use the exterior angle theorem or something.

Alternatively, since angle at C is 70°, and AB || CD, then maybe angle between CD and AC is equal to angle between AB and AC, because of the parallel lines. Wait, not sure.

Wait, if AB || CD, then the angle between AC and AB is equal to the angle between AC and CD. But this would be true if AC were a transversal, but AC is not necessarily a transversal.

Wait, AC is a line from A to C, and since AB || CD, the angle between AC and AB is equal to the angle between AC and CD if AC is a transversal. But this is only true if AC crosses both AB and CD, which it does. So, the angle between AC and AB (which is angle CAB = α) is equal to the angle between AC and CD.

But the angle between AC and CD at point C is part of angle at C, which is 70°. Wait, let me clarify.

At point C, the line CD is one side, and the line CB is another. The angle at C is between CB and CD. But if AB || CD, then the angle between AC and AB (which is α) is equal to the angle between AC and CD. So, angle between AC and CD is α.

But angle at C is between CB and CD, which is 70°. So, if I can express this angle in terms of α and other angles.

Wait, at point C, the angle between CB and CD is 70°. But the angle between AC and CD is α. So, if I can relate these.

Let me imagine at point C, the lines are CB, CD, and AC. The angle between CB and CD is 70°, and the angle between AC and CD is α. So, if I can find the angle between AC and CB, which is the angle at C in triangle ABC, which is 70°. Wait, no. The angle at C in triangle ABC is between CB and CA, not CB and CD.

Wait, this is getting tangled. Let me try to clarify.

At point C, we have three lines: CB, CD, and CA. The angle between CB and CD is 70° (given). The angle between CA and CD is alpha (since AB || CD and AC is a transversal, so angle between AC and AB = angle between AC and CD). So, the angle between CA and CD is alpha. 

Now, the angle between CB and CA is the angle at C in triangle ABC, which is 70°, as given. So, at point C, we have:

angle between CB and CA = 70° (this is angle ACB in triangle ABC)

angle between CA and CD = alpha

angle between CB and CD = 70°

Wait, but how do these angles relate? At point C, the sum of angles around point C should be 360°, but since it's a single point, the sum of angles around it is 360°. But in this case, we have three lines: CB, CD, and CA. The angles between them would be:

Between CB and CA: 70°

Between CA and CD: alpha

Between CD and CB: let's call it gamma.

So, 70° + alpha + gamma = 360°? No, that's not correct. At a single point, the sum of angles around it is 360°, but these are angles between different pairs of lines. Let me think.

Actually, at point C, the lines are CB, CD, and CA. The angles between these lines are:

Between CB and CA: 70° (angle ACB)

Between CA and CD: alpha (as per parallel lines)

Between CD and CB: let's call it beta.

But these three angles should add up to 360°, but since they are angles around point C, but actually, they form a full rotation. However, in reality, the angle between CB and CD is the sum of the angle between CB and CA and the angle between CA and CD, if the lines are arranged in a certain way.

Wait, if at point C, lines CB and CD are on opposite sides of CA, then the angle between CB and CD would be the sum of the angle between CB and CA and the angle between CA and CD. So, if the angle between CB and CA is 70°, and the angle between CA and CD is alpha, then the angle between CB and CD is 70° + alpha. But we are told that the angle at C (between CB and CD) is 70°, so:

70° + alpha = 70° → alpha = 0°, which is impossible.

This suggests a contradiction, so my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, this indicates that my earlier assumption about the angle between CA and CD being alpha is incorrect. Where did I go wrong?

Earlier, I assumed that because AB || CD, the angle between AC and AB (alpha) is equal to the angle between AC and CD. This is true if AC is a transversal cutting AB and CD, and the lines are parallel. So, the corresponding angles would be equal. But in this case, the angle between AC and AB at A is alpha, and the corresponding angle on line CD would be the angle between AC and CD at C. Wait, no, the angle between AC and CD would be at point C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me clarify: if AB || CD, and AC is a transversal, then the angle between AB and AC at A is equal to the angle between CD and AC at C. But the angle between CD and AC at C is part of the angle at C in triangle ABC. So, if the angle between AB and AC at A is alpha, then the angle between CD and AC at C is also alpha. But this angle at C is part of the angle at C in triangle ABC, which is 70°. So, if this angle is alpha, then the remaining angle at C would be 70° - alpha.

But this is getting complex. Let me try to formalize:

Because AB || CD, and AC is a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal. So, the angle between AB and AC at A (which is alpha) is equal to the angle between CD and AC at C. Let's call this angle at C as alpha.

But in triangle ABC, the angle at C is the angle between CB and CA, which is 70°. But if the angle between CD and CA at C is alpha, then the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° - alpha.

But earlier, I thought that the angle between CB and CD at C is 70°, but this might not be correct. Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(C),70.0). This likely refers to angle at C in triangle ABC, which is between CB and CA, not CB and CD. So, my earlier assumption was incorrect.

Therefore, the angle between CD and CA at C is alpha, and the angle at C in triangle ABC (between CB and CA) is 70°. So, the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° - alpha.

But how does this help?

If I consider the line CD, which is parallel to AB, and the angle between CD and CA is alpha. Then, at point C, the angle between CD and CA is alpha, and the angle between CB and CA is 70°, so the angle between CB and CD is 70° - alpha.

But I'm not sure how to use this. Let me try to relate this to other parts of the diagram.

At point E, we have line CD and line AE. The angle between AE and CD at E is alpha/2 (as before). Also, the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° - alpha. But I don't see a direct connection.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, the angle between AE and AB is alpha/2, and the angle between AE and CD is also alpha/2. This angle at E (between AE and CD) is alpha/2, which is part of angle AED.

But angle AED = 70° + alpha/2, as derived earlier.

If I can relate alpha to the angle at C, which is 70°, using the relationship between the angles at C and the angle between CD and CA.

Earlier, we said that the angle between CD and CA at C is alpha, and the angle at C in triangle ABC is 70°, which is between CB and CA. So, the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° - alpha.

But how to use this?

Maybe considering triangle CDE or something else.

Wait, at point C, we have angle between CB and CD as 70° - alpha. If I can relate this to other angles.

Alternatively, since CD is parallel to AB, and CB is a line from C to B, then the angle between CB and CD (70° - alpha) is equal to the angle between CB and AB, because of the parallel lines. Wait, because CD || AB, the angle between CB and CD is equal to the angle between CB and AB.

Wait, let me explain: since CD || AB, and CB is a transversal, the angle between CB and CD is equal to the angle between CB and AB. Let's call this angle phi.

So, phi = 70° - alpha.

But phi is also the angle between CB and AB at point B, which is angle ABC, which is β.

So, β = 70° - alpha.

But earlier, from triangle ABC, we had α + β = 110°.

Substituting β = 70° - alpha into this equation:

α + (70° - alpha) = 110° → 70° = 110°, which is a contradiction.

Wait, this suggests an error in my reasoning.

Where is the mistake here?

Let me re-examine: I said that the angle between CB and CD is equal to the angle between CB and AB, because CD || AB. But this is only true if the transversal is CB, and the angles are on the same side. Let me think.

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Or alternate interior angles are equal.

In this case, CD || AB, and CB is a transversal. The angle between CB and CD at C is one angle, and the angle between CB and AB at B is another angle. These are consecutive interior angles, so they should be supplementary.

Ah! So, the angle between CB and CD at C (which is 70° - alpha) plus the angle between CB and AB at B (which is beta) equals 180°.

So, (70° - alpha) + beta = 180°.

But from triangle ABC, we have alpha + beta = 110°.

Now, we have two equations:

1) alpha + beta = 110°

2) (70° - alpha) + beta = 180°

Let me write these:

Equation 1: alpha + beta = 110°

Equation 2: -alpha + beta = 110° (since 70° - alpha + beta = 180° → -alpha + beta = 110°)

Now, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

(-alpha + beta) - (alpha + beta) = 110° - 110°

→ -2alpha = 0 → alpha = 0°, which is impossible.

This indicates a contradiction, suggesting an error in the assumptions.

Let me trace back where the error occurred.

I assumed that the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° - alpha, and that this angle is supplementary to beta. But this might be incorrect.

Let me re-express: when CD || AB, and CB is a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are the angle between CB and CD at C, and the angle between CB and AB at B. These should be supplementary.

So, angle at C (between CB and CD) + angle at B (between CB and AB) = 180°.

But the angle at C between CB and CD is not necessarily 70° - alpha. Earlier, I said that the angle between CD and CA at C is alpha, and the angle at C in triangle ABC is 70°, so the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° - alpha. But this might be incorrect.

Let me redefine: the angle at C in triangle ABC is between CB and CA, which is 70°. The angle between CD and CA at C is alpha (because of the parallel lines). So, the angle between CB and CD at C is the difference between the angle at C (70°) and the angle between CA and CD (alpha). But depending on the orientation, it could be 70° - alpha or alpha - 70°, but since angles are positive, it should be 70° - alpha.

But then, adding this to angle at B (beta) should give 180°, leading to:

(70° - alpha) + beta = 180°

But from triangle ABC, alpha + beta = 110°, so substituting beta = 110° - alpha into the first equation:

70° - alpha + 110° - alpha = 180°

→ 180° - 2alpha = 180°

→ -2alpha = 0 → alpha = 0°, which is impossible.

This suggests a fundamental flaw in the assumptions.

Let me reconsider the angle between CD and CA at C. If AB || CD, and AC is a transversal, then the angle between AC and AB at A (alpha) is equal to the angle between AC and CD at C. This is because they are corresponding angles.

So, the angle between AC and CD at C is alpha. This angle is part of the angle at C in triangle ABC, which is between CB and CA (70°). So, the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° - alpha.

But this led to a contradiction, indicating that my assumption about the angle between AC and CD at C being alpha is wrong.

Wait, maybe it's the other way around. If AB || CD, and AC is a transversal, then the angle between AC and AB at A (alpha) is equal to the angle between AC and CD at C, but this angle at C is on the other side of AC. So, if the angle between AC and CD at C is alpha, then the angle between CB and CD at C would be 180° - alpha, since it's a straight line.

Wait, let me think: at point C, the line CD extends from C, and the line CA goes to A. The angle between CA and CD is alpha (corresponding angle). The line CB goes to B, forming the angle at C in triangle ABC, which is 70°. So, the angle between CB and CD at C would be the supplement of the angle between CA and CD if CB is on the opposite side of CA.

Wait, this is getting too vague without a diagram. Let me try to visualize: at point C, there are three lines: CB, CD, and CA. The angle between CA and CD is alpha (due to parallel lines). The angle between CA and CB is 70° (angle at C in triangle ABC). So, the angle between CB and CD would be 70° + alpha or |70° - alpha|, depending on the arrangement.

If the angle between CA and CD is alpha, and the angle between CA and CB is 70°, then the angle between CB and CD would be 70° + alpha if they are on opposite sides of CA, or |70° - alpha| if on the same side.

Assuming they are on opposite sides, the angle between CB and CD is 70° + alpha. Then, since CD || AB, and CB is a transversal, the consecutive interior angles would be the angle between CB and CD (70° + alpha) and the angle between CB and AB (beta). These should be supplementary:

(70° + alpha) + beta = 180°

From triangle ABC: alpha + beta = 110°

So, we have:

70° + alpha + beta = 180°

But alpha + beta = 110°, so 70° + 110° = 180°, which holds true!

This works! So, this resolves the contradiction.

So, the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° + alpha, and this is supplementary to beta, giving:

70° + alpha + beta = 180°

Which simplifies to alpha + beta = 110°, which matches the earlier equation from triangle ABC.

So, this confirms that the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° + alpha, and this is supplementary to beta.

Now, this doesn't directly give us alpha, but it confirms consistency.

But how to find alpha?

Let me think about the line AE and the angles at E.

Previously, we had angle AED = 70° + alpha/2.

But we need to find alpha.

Let me consider the line AE, which is the angle bisector of alpha, and E is on CD. Since CD is parallel to AB, and AE is a transversal, the angle between AE and AB is alpha/2, and the angle between AE and CD is also alpha/2.

At point E, this angle (alpha/2) is part of triangle AED. But we also have the angle at E in triangle AEC, which is 110° - alpha/2.

But how to relate this to other parts.

Wait, let me think about the line EC. At point C, the angle between CB and CD is 70° + alpha. And at point E, we have line EC, which connects E to C. Let me consider triangle ECD or something.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, the angle between AE and AB (alpha/2) is equal to the angle between AE and CD at E (also alpha/2). This angle at E is part of angle AED, which we have as 70° + alpha/2.

But I still don't see how to find alpha.

Wait, let me recall that in triangle ACE, we have angle at C is 70°, angle at A is alpha/2, and angle at E is 110° - alpha/2. Also, the angle at E in triangle ACE is the same as the angle between AE and EC, which is 110° - alpha/2.

But this angle at E (110° - alpha/2) is also part of the angle at E between AE and CD, which is alpha/2, and the angle between EC and CD, which is 70° + alpha (from earlier). Wait, no. At point E, the line CD has two directions: from E to D and from E to C. The angle between AE and CD is alpha/2, and the angle between EC and CD is the angle at E between EC and CD, which is part of the angle at C.

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to use the fact that in triangle ACE, the angles are 70°, alpha/2, and 110° - alpha/2. And in triangle AED, angle AED = 70° + alpha/2.

But if I can find another expression for angle AED, maybe through triangle AED and other relationships.

Let me consider triangle AED. We know angle at E is 70° + alpha/2, angle at A is ...?

At point A, in triangle AED, the angle at A is the angle between EA and DA. But DA is part of CD, which is parallel to AB. So, the angle between DA (which is part of CD) and EA is the same as the angle between AB and EA, because of parallel lines. Wait, no, because DA is part of CD, and AB is parallel to CD, so the angle between DA and EA is equal to the angle between AB and EA.

But the angle between AB and EA is alpha/2 (since AE is the angle bisector). So, angle at A in triangle AED is alpha/2.

Wait, this is a crucial insight!

At point A, the angle between EA and DA (which is part of CD, parallel to AB) is equal to the angle between EA and AB, which is alpha/2. So, in triangle AED, angle at A is alpha/2, angle at E is 70° + alpha/2, and angle at D is 180° - (alpha/2 + 70° + alpha/2) = 180° - (70° + alpha) = 110° - alpha.

But this angle at D is part of triangle AED, but I don't know if it helps.

But in triangle AED, the sum of angles is 180°, so:

angle at A + angle at E + angle at D = 180°

(alpha/2) + (70° + alpha/2) + angle at D = 180°

Simplifying:

alpha/2 + 70° + alpha/2 + angle at D = 180°

→ alpha + 70° + angle at D = 180°

→ angle at D = 110° - alpha

But I don't know angle at D.

However, this doesn't seem to give new information.

Wait, but if I can relate angle at D to something else.

Since CD is parallel to AB, and DA is part of CD, then the angle at D might relate to other angles.

But without more information, this is not helpful.

Let me return to the earlier equation: angle AED = 70° + alpha/2. If I can find alpha, I can find angle AED.

But how?

Wait, let me recall that in triangle ABC, alpha + beta = 110°, and from the parallel lines, we had that the angle between CB and CD at C is 70° + alpha, which is supplementary to beta, giving 70° + alpha + beta = 180°, which is consistent.

But this doesn't help us find alpha.

Wait, but maybe there's a way to relate alpha with the angle at D in triangle AED, which is 110° - alpha.

But without knowing more about the diagram, this is not helpful.

At this point, I realize I might need to make an assumption or find a different approach.

Let me recall that the answer options are A:110°, B:125°, C:135°, D:140°.

If I assume that angle AED is 110°, then from angle AED = 70° + alpha/2, we have 110° = 70° + alpha/2 → alpha/2 = 40° → alpha = 80°. Then, from alpha + beta = 110°, beta = 30°.

Is there a way to verify this?

If alpha is 80°, then in triangle ABC, angles are alpha = 80°, beta = 30°, and gamma = 70°, which sums to 180° (80+30+70=180). This is valid.

Now, let's check if this satisfies other conditions.

With alpha = 80°, angle AED = 70 + 80/2 = 70 + 40 = 110°, which is option A.

But how to confirm this is correct?

Let me think: if alpha = 80°, then the angle between AE and AB is 40°, and since AB || CD, the angle between AE and CD at E is also 40°. In triangle AED, angle at E is 40°, angle at A is 40° (as explained earlier), so angle at D would be 100°, and angle AED would be 180 - 40 - 100 = 40°, but this contradicts the earlier calculation.

Wait, no. Wait, in triangle AED, angle at A is alpha/2 = 40°, angle at E is 70° + alpha/2 = 110°, so angle at D is 180 - 40 - 110 = 30°. This is possible.

But how does this relate to other parts of the diagram?

It seems consistent, but how to confirm.

Alternatively, let's consider that if alpha = 80°, then in triangle ACE, angle at A is 40°, angle at C is 70°, so angle at E is 180 - 40 - 70 = 70°. Then, angle AEC = 70°, and since angle AEC + angle AED = 180°, angle AED = 110°, which matches.

This suggests that angle AED is 110°, which is option A.

But how to justify alpha = 80°? It came from assuming angle AED = 110°, which is one of the options.

But this assumes that angle AED is 110°, which is what we're trying to find. This seems circular.

However, given the lack of other approaches and the consistency of the equations, it's plausible that the correct answer is 110°, option A.

Therefore, after this lengthy exploration, I conclude that the measure of angle AED is 110°, so the answer is A.
