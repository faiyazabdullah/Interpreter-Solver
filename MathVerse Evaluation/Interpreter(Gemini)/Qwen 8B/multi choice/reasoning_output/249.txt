MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, and F. There's a circle centered at F because it says Circle(F). All these points lie on the circle since each of them has PointLiesOnCircle with Circle(F). That means F is the center of the circle, and A, B, C, D are points on the circumference. Also, the radii are mentioned for lines FA, FB, FC, FD, so all those segments are radii of the circle. Therefore, FA = FB = FC = FD, which implies all these points are equidistant from F, confirming they're on the same circle with center F.

Next, there are some angle measures given. MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,C),72) means angle BFC is 72 degrees. Then, MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,A),(4a-1)) – so angle CFA is 4a - 1 degrees. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D),(2a-5)) gives angle AFD as 2a - 5 degrees. Also, there's an equation that adds up four angles: angle BFC + angle CFA + angle AFD + angle BFA equals 360 degrees. Wait, but angle BFA isn't directly given yet. Let me note that down.

The question asks for the measure of angle CFD. Since all points are on the circle with center F, angle CFD would be a central angle subtended by arc CD. But maybe I need to find other angles first.

Let me start by writing down the equations based on the given measures. We know angle BFC is 72°, angle CFA is 4a -1°, angle AFD is 2a -5°, and angle BFA is something we need to find? Or perhaps relate them?

Wait, the sum of the angles around point F should add up to 360°, right? Because around a point, the total angles sum to 360°. So the given equation is adding angle BFC (which is 72°), angle CFA (4a -1), angle AFD (2a -5), and angle BFA. Their sum equals 360°. Let me check if that's accurate. 

But wait, how do these angles fit together? Let me visualize the points on the circle. Points A, B, C, D are on the circle centered at F. Let me imagine the order of the points. Suppose the points are arranged such that moving around the circle, we have B, then C, then D, then A, connected back to B? Not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe the order is different. However, since angles involve certain pairs, like BFC, CFA, AFD, BFA, I need to think about how these angles are positioned.

Let me consider that each angle is formed by two radii. For example, angle BFC is formed by points B, F, C. Similarly, angle CFA is formed by C, F, A. Angle AFD is A, F, D. And angle BFA is B, F, A. These angles are all central angles. 

Now, considering the entire circle, the sum of all central angles around point F should be 360°. So, if we can express all the central angles in terms of variables, we can set up an equation. 

We already have angle BFC = 72°, angle CFA = 4a -1°, angle AFD = 2a -5°, and angle BFA. Are there more angles? Let me see. Depending on the arrangement of points, there might be other angles. But according to the given equation, the sum of those four angles equals 360°. Let me confirm that.

The equation Add(MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,C)),MeasureOf(Angle(C,F,A)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,D)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,F,A)),360). So that's angle BFC + angle CFA + angle AFD + angle BFA = 360°. So yes, those four angles add up to 360°. 

Therefore, substituting the known values:

72° + (4a -1) + (2a -5) + angle BFA = 360°.

But we need to find angle BFA. However, angle BFA is another central angle. How does that relate to other angles? Let's think about the positions of the points. 

Since all points are on the circle, the order matters. Let me try to arrange them in order. Let's assume the points are placed clockwise around the circle as B, C, D, A. Then, angle BFC would be between B and C, angle CFA would be between C and A, angle AFD between A and D, and angle BFA between B and A. Wait, but that may not cover the full circle. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the points are ordered as B, C, A, D going around the circle. Let me try to sketch mentally. If angle BFC is 72°, then arc BC is 72°. Then angle CFA is 4a -1°, which would correspond to arc CA. Angle AFD is 2a -5°, corresponding to arc AD. Then angle BFA would correspond to arc BA. Adding all arcs BC + CA + AD + AB = full circle, which is 360°. So that makes sense. 

So, the sum of arcs BC, CA, AD, AB equals 360°. Each of these arcs corresponds to the central angles. Therefore, the equation becomes:

arc BC (72°) + arc CA (4a -1) + arc AD (2a -5) + arc AB (angle BFA) = 360°.

But angle BFA is the central angle for arc BA. However, without knowing the position of D, it's hard to tell. Wait, but maybe there's another way. Let me consider that angle BFA is also part of the circle. Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between angles involving point D. 

Wait, but we need to find angle CFD. Let's recall that angle CFD is a central angle subtended by arc CD. So once we find the measure of arc CD, that would be the measure of angle CFD. 

To find arc CD, we need to determine the measure of arc CD. Since the total circle is 360°, and we have arcs BC, CA, AD, AB. Wait, but where is point D located? Let me think. 

Assuming points are arranged in order B, C, A, D around the circle. Then arc BC is 72°, arc CA is 4a -1°, arc AD is 2a -5°, and arc AB is angle BFA. But then, the remaining arc would be arc DC? No, because if we go from D to C, that's arc DC. Wait, but the total of arcs BC + CA + AD + AB would be 360°, but arc DC is missing here. Maybe my assumption about the order of points is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged as B, C, D, A around the circle. Let me try that. Then, arc BC is 72°, arc CD is ?, arc DA is 2a -5°, and arc AB is ?. Hmm, but angle CFA would be the central angle between C and A, which would pass through D. Wait, if the order is B, C, D, A, then arc CA would go through D, making it arc CD + arc DA. But angle CFA is the central angle between C and A, so that would be arc CD + arc DA. Which is arc CD plus arc DA. But angle CFA is given as 4a -1. Similarly, angle AFD is between A and D, so that would be arc AD. 

This seems complicated. Maybe I should focus on the equation given: angle BFC (72) + angle CFA (4a -1) + angle AFD (2a -5) + angle BFA = 360. 

So plugging numbers:

72 + (4a -1) + (2a -5) + angle BFA = 360

Combine like terms:

72 -1 -5 + 4a + 2a + angle BFA = 360 → 66 + 6a + angle BFA = 360 → 6a + angle BFA = 294.

But angle BFA is another central angle. How can I express angle BFA in terms of other variables?

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, the sum of all central angles around F should be 360°. So, the central angles are:

Angle BFC (BC): 72°,

Angle CFA (CA): 4a -1°,

Angle AFD (AD): 2a -5°,

And angle BFA (AB): ?

Additionally, there might be another angle involving D. Wait, but the given equation includes only those four angles. Perhaps angle BFA is the remaining one. 

But then, if I denote angle BFA as x, then:

72 + (4a -1) + (2a -5) + x = 360 → 72 + 4a -1 + 2a -5 + x = 360 → 66 + 6a + x = 360 → 6a + x = 294.

But I don't know x yet. However, there might be another relation. For instance, if I consider the rest of the circle. Let me think about the positions again.

Suppose the points are arranged as B, C, A, D around the circle. Then, the central angles would be:

From B to C: 72° (angle BFC),

From C to A: angle CFA = 4a -1°,

From A to D: angle AFD = 2a -5°,

Then from D back to B: angle BFD? Wait, but angle BFA is the angle from B to A. So if the order is B, C, A, D, then from D back to B would require going through the other side. But angle BFA is the central angle between B and A, which could be either the minor arc BA or major arc BA. However, since all points are on the circle, and assuming standard position, angle BFA would be the smaller arc BA unless specified otherwise.

But without knowing the exact order, it's tricky. However, maybe there's another way. Let me think about the fact that all points are on the circle, so the sum of all central angles must be 360°. The given equation includes angle BFC (72°), angle CFA (4a -1), angle AFD (2a -5), and angle BFA. So the sum of these four angles is 360. But there might be another central angle involving point D. Wait, but angle BFA is already included. 

Alternatively, maybe angle BFA is related to another angle. For example, angle BFD or something else. Wait, but the problem mentions angle CFD, which is between C, F, D. So angle CFD is the central angle between C and D. To find that, I need to find the measure of arc CD. 

But how to find arc CD? Well, if I can find the measure of arc CD, that's the measure of angle CFD. 

Arc CD can be found by subtracting the known arcs from 360°. Let me consider that:

Total circle is 360°, so arc BC + arc CD + arc DA + arc AB = 360°. But we have arc BC as 72°, arc DA as 2a -5°, arc AB as angle BFA (x). However, arc CD is what we need. Wait, but how does arc CD relate to the other arcs? 

Wait, if arc BC is 72°, arc CA is 4a -1°, which would be arc BC + arc CD + arc DA? No, arc CA would be from C to A, which could be arc CD + arc DA if D is between C and A. But earlier, I was confused about the order. 

Let me take a different approach. Let's suppose that the points are labeled in the order B, C, D, A around the circle. Then:

Arc BC = 72° (from B to C).

Arc CD = ?

Arc DA = 2a -5° (given angle AFD, which is from A to D).

Arc AB = ?

Then, the total of these arcs is 72 + arc CD + (2a -5) + arc AB = 360. But I still don't know arc CD or arc AB. However, angle CFA is given as 4a -1°, which is the central angle between C and A. So arc CA is 4a -1°, which would be arc CD + arc DA. So:

arc CD + arc DA = 4a -1 → arc CD + (2a -5) = 4a -1 → arc CD = 4a -1 - (2a -5) = 2a +4. 

So arc CD = 2a +4. Therefore, angle CFD, being the central angle over arc CD, is equal to arc CD, so measure is 2a +4 degrees. So if I can find the value of 'a', then I can compute angle CFD. 

Now, how to find 'a'? Let's return to the previous equation:

From the sum of the angles:

72 + (4a -1) + (2a -5) + angle BFA = 360.

Earlier, we had:

72 + (4a -1) + (2a -5) + x = 360 → 66 + 6a + x = 360 → x = 294 -6a.

But x is angle BFA, which is the central angle between B and A, i.e., arc BA. Arc BA is equal to x. Now, considering the total circle, we have:

arc BC (72) + arc CD (2a+4) + arc DA (2a -5) + arc AB (x) = 360.

Substituting:

72 + (2a +4) + (2a -5) + x = 360.

Simplify:

72 + 2a +4 + 2a -5 + x = 360 → 72 +4 -5 +4a +x = 360 → 66 +4a +x = 360.

But from before, x = 294 -6a. Substituting into this equation:

66 +4a + (294 -6a) = 360 → 66 +294 -2a = 360 → 360 -2a = 360 → -2a = 0 → a=0. 

Wait, that leads to a=0, which seems problematic. Let me check my steps again.

First, when I considered arc CD = 2a +4, that came from arc CD + arc DA = 4a -1. So arc CD = 4a -1 - arc DA. Since arc DA is given as 2a -5, then arc CD = 4a -1 - (2a -5) = 2a +4. Correct.

Then, total circle:

arc BC (72) + arc CD (2a +4) + arc DA (2a -5) + arc AB (x) = 360.

Which simplifies to 72 + 2a +4 + 2a -5 + x = 360 → 72 +4 -5 = 66, then 66 + 4a + x = 360. So 66 +4a +x = 360 → 4a +x = 294. But earlier, from the angle sum equation, we had x = 294 -6a. So substituting:

4a + (294 -6a) = 294 → -2a +294 = 294 → -2a = 0 → a=0. 

Hmm, this suggests a=0, which would make angle CFA =4a -1 = -1 degree, which is impossible. Clearly, there's a mistake here. Where did I go wrong?

Let me retrace. 

The error might be in how I determined arc CD. Let me reconsider. 

Angle CFA is the central angle between points C and A. Depending on the position of D, arc CA could be the shorter arc or longer arc. However, since angle CFA is given as 4a -1, and angles can't be negative, we need 4a -1 >0 → a>0.25. But if a=0, that would make it negative, so our calculation leading to a=0 must be wrong. Hence, there's a mistake in my assumptions.

Alternative approach: Let me think again about the angles involved. 

Given that angle BFC is 72°, angle CFA is 4a -1, angle AFD is 2a -5, and angle BFA is x. Summing to 360°. 

Also, since points A, B, C, D are on the circle, the sum of the central angles around F should be 360°. So, the central angles are:

Between B and C: 72°,

Between C and A: 4a -1,

Between A and D: 2a -5,

Between D and B: ?

But wait, what about the fourth angle? It depends on the order. If the points are B, C, A, D, then the angle between D and B would be the central angle for arc DB. But in the given equation, the sum includes angle BFA (between B and A), which would be arc BA. So perhaps there's an overlap. 

Alternatively, maybe there are overlapping arcs. Let me try to list all arcs:

Arc BC: 72°,

Arc CA: 4a -1,

Arc AD: 2a -5,

Arc DB: ?

These four arcs would sum to 360°. 

But angle BFA is the central angle between B and A, which would be arc BA. Arc BA could be composed of arc BC + arc CA? No, if the points are in order B, C, A, D, then arc BA goes from B to A passing through C, which would be arc BC + arc CA = 72 + (4a -1) = 4a +61. But angle BFA is supposed to be x, which is the central angle between B and A. So x = arc BA = 4a +61. 

But earlier, from the equation 72 + (4a -1) + (2a -5) + x = 360, we get:

72 +4a -1 +2a -5 +x = 360 → 66 +6a +x = 360 → x = 294 -6a.

But also, x = arc BA = arc BC + arc CA = 72 + (4a -1) = 4a +71. 

So setting these equal:

4a +71 = 294 -6a → 10a = 223 → a = 22.3. 

Wait, that's possible. Let me check. 

Wait, arc BA could be the other way around, the major arc, but usually, central angles are considered as the smaller arc unless stated otherwise. But if that's the case, then arc BA would be the smaller arc, which would be the same as arc BC + arc CA if the points are ordered B, C, A, D. But that depends on the actual arrangement. 

However, if arc BA is indeed 4a +71, then combining with x = 294 -6a, we have:

4a +71 = 294 -6a → 10a = 223 → a = 22.3. This gives a non-integer value, which might be okay, but let's proceed. 

Once we have a, we can find angle CFD, which is arc CD. 

How to find arc CD? 

If the points are in order B, C, A, D, then arc CD would be the arc from C to D, which is arc CA minus arc AD? Or wait, arc CA is from C to A, which passes through D if D is between C and A. 

Wait, if the order is B, C, D, A, then from C to D is one arc, and from D to A is another. So arc CD is from C to D, and arc DA is from D to A. Then, arc CA would be arc CD + arc DA = 2a +4 (as previously calculated), but that led to inconsistency. 

Alternatively, if arc CA is the direct arc from C to A, which could be arc CD + arc DA if D is between C and A. So arc CD + arc DA = arc CA = 4a -1. 

So arc CD = arc CA - arc DA = (4a -1) - (2a -5) = 2a +4. 

Thus, angle CFD is equal to arc CD, which is 2a +4 degrees. 

With a = 22.3, angle CFD = 2*(22.3) +4 = 44.6 +4 = 48.6 degrees. But none of the options are close to that. This suggests that my assumption about the arc BA might be wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe arc BA is not the sum of BC and CA, but instead is something else. Let me think again. 

If the points are in order B, C, D, A around the circle, then arc BA would be the arc from B to A passing through D. So arc BD + arc DA. But arc BD is from B to D, which would be arc BC + arc CD. 

But I'm getting too tangled here. Let me try another approach. 

Let me use the two equations I have:

From the angle sum: x = 294 -6a.

From the arc BA: x = arc BA. 

If arc BA is the arc from B to A, which could be either the minor arc or major arc. Assuming it's the minor arc, then it's equal to the sum of arcs BC + arc CD + arc DA? No, that depends on the order. 

Alternatively, since angle CFA is 4a -1, which is arc CA. If arc CA is the minor arc, then arc CA = 4a -1. 

Similarly, arc DA is 2a -5. 

If arc CA = arc CD + arc DA, then arc CD = arc CA - arc DA = (4a -1) - (2a -5) = 2a +4. 

So angle CFD = arc CD = 2a +4. 

Now, to find a, I need another equation. 

Earlier, I tried assuming arc BA = arc BC + arc CA, but that gave an inconsistency. Let me think differently. 

The total of all arcs around the circle is 360°. So:

arc BC + arc CD + arc DA + arc AB = 360.

We know arc BC = 72°, arc CD = 2a +4, arc DA = 2a -5, and arc AB = x. 

So:

72 + (2a +4) + (2a -5) + x = 360 → 72 + 4a + x -1 = 360 → 71 +4a +x = 360 → 4a +x = 289. 

But from the angle sum equation, x = 294 -6a. Substituting:

4a + (294 -6a) = 289 → -2a +294 = 289 → -2a = -5 → a = 2.5. 

Ah! Here's the mistake earlier. Previously, I thought arc BC + ... summed to 360, but earlier I incorrectly added 72 +4a +x = 360, but actually, it's 71 +4a +x = 360. So fixing that, we have a=2.5. 

Great! Now, a=2.5. Let's verify. 

So, a = 2.5. Then:

angle CFA = 4a -1 = 4*2.5 -1 = 10 -1 = 9°. 

angle AFD = 2a -5 = 2*2.5 -5 = 5 -5 = 0°. Wait, that can't be. An angle of 0 degrees? That doesn't make sense. What's wrong here?

Wait, angle AFD is the central angle between A and D. If it's zero, that would imply points A and D are the same, which contradicts the given that they are distinct points on the circle. So there's another error here. 

What went wrong? Let me check the calculation again. 

From the total arc equation: 72 + (2a +4) + (2a -5) + x = 360. 

Calculating:

72 + 2a +4 + 2a -5 +x = 360 → 72 +4 -5 + 4a +x = 360 → 66 +4a +x = 360 → 4a +x = 294. 

But earlier, from the angle sum equation, x = 294 -6a. So substituting into 4a +x = 294 gives 4a + (294 -6a) = 294 → -2a = 0 → a=0. 

Wait, this loops back to the original contradiction. So there must be a fundamental error in my assumptions. 

Perhaps the assumption that arc CA = arc CD + arc DA is incorrect. Maybe arc CA is not passing through D? Let me rethink. 

If angle CFA is the central angle between C and A, it could be the minor arc CA or the major arc CA. But since it's a central angle, it's typically the smaller arc unless specified otherwise. So if the points are arranged such that arc CA is the minor arc, then depending on where D is, arc CA might not include D. 

For example, if the points are ordered B, C, D, A, then arc CA would be the arc from C to A passing through D, hence including arc CD and DA. But if the points are ordered B, C, A, D, then arc CA would be the direct arc from C to A, not passing through D. In this case, arc CA would be separate from DA. 

So, if arc CA is the direct arc from C to A, then arc CA is 4a -1, and arc DA is 2a -5. But then, arc CD would depend on the other points. 

Let me try this scenario. Assume that the points are ordered B, C, A, D around the circle. Then:

arc BC = 72° (from B to C),

arc CA = 4a -1° (direct from C to A),

arc AD = 2a -5° (from A to D),

and arc DB = ? (from D to B). 

In this case, the total of arcs BC + CA + AD + DB = 360°. 

But angle BFA is the central angle between B and A, which would be arc BA. Arc BA would be arc BC + arc CA = 72 + (4a -1) = 4a +71. 

So, x = arc BA = 4a +71. 

From the angle sum equation: 72 + (4a -1) + (2a -5) + x = 360 → 66 +6a +x = 360 → x = 294 -6a. 

Setting equal to arc BA: 4a +71 = 294 -6a → 10a = 223 → a = 22.3. 

Then, angle CFD is the central angle between C and D. To find this, we need arc CD. 

Arc CD is the arc from C to D. Since points are ordered B, C, A, D, arc CD would be arc CA + arc AD? No, arc CA is from C to A, and arc AD is from A to D. So arc CD would be arc CA + arc AD if D is after A. Wait, no. From C to D, it would be arc CA + arc AD? No, if the order is B, C, A, D, then from C to D, it's arc CA + arc AD? No, from C to D would be arc CD, which would be arc CA + arc AD only if D is after A. Wait, no. Let me visualize:

Points in order B -> C -> A -> D -> B. So from C to D, it's arc C->A->D. So arc CD is arc CA + arc AD = (4a -1) + (2a -5) = 6a -6. 

Therefore, angle CFD = arc CD = 6a -6. 

With a=22.3, this would be 6*22.3 -6 = 133.8 -6 = 127.8 degrees. Closest to option D (123) or C (120)? Not matching any options. 

But this suggests that there's still a mistake. 

Alternatively, maybe arc CD is the other way around, the major arc CD. But that would be larger than 180°, which is unlikely unless specified. 

Alternatively, maybe my assumption about the order of points is incorrect. Let me try a different order. 

Suppose the points are ordered B, C, D, A around the circle. Then:

arc BC = 72°,

arc CD = ?

arc DA = 2a -5°,

arc AB = ?

Angle CFA is the central angle between C and A. From C to A would pass through D, so arc CD + arc DA = 4a -1. Thus, arc CD = 4a -1 - (2a -5) = 2a +4. 

So angle CFD is arc CD = 2a +4. 

Now, the total of arcs BC + CD + DA + AB = 360°. 

So:

72 + (2a +4) + (2a -5) + x = 360 → 72 + 4a + x -1 = 360 → 71 +4a +x = 360 → 4a +x = 289. 

From the angle sum equation: x = 294 -6a. 

Substitute into 4a +x = 289:

4a + (294 -6a) = 289 → -2a +294 = 289 → -2a = -5 → a = 2.5. 

Now, a=2.5. 

Check angle AFD: 2a -5 = 5 -5 = 0°, which is invalid. So this is a problem. 

But why is angle AFD zero? Because arc DA is 2a -5 = 0, implying points D and A are the same, which can't be. Hence, this suggests that my assumption about the arc DA is incorrect. 

Wait, angle AFD is the central angle between A and D, which is arc AD. So if arc AD is 2a -5, and a=2.5, it's 0°, which is impossible. So there must be an error in how I'm relating the angles to arcs. 

Maybe angle AFD is not arc AD, but another arc. Let me re-examine. 

Angle AFD is the angle at F between points A and D. So it's the central angle between A and D, which is arc AD. So if arc AD is 2a -5, then it must be positive. So 2a -5 > 0 → a > 2.5. 

But from above, we got a=2.5, which makes it zero. So this indicates that my previous setup is flawed. 

Where is the mistake? Let me revisit the angle sum equation. 

Original equation: angle BFC + angle CFA + angle AFD + angle BFA = 360°. 

But angle BFA is the central angle between B and A, which is arc BA. 

But if points are ordered B, C, D, A, then arc BA would be arc BC + arc CD + arc DA? No, from B to A would pass through C, D, or directly? 

If the order is B, C, D, A, then arc BA would be the arc from B to A passing through C and D, which is arc BC + arc CD + arc DA. Or alternatively, the shorter arc from B to A. 

But if arc BA is the shorter arc, then it would be arc BC + arc CD + arc DA only if that is less than 180°. Otherwise, it would be the other way. 

This is getting too convoluted. Let me try to approach it algebraically. 

We have two equations:

1. From the angle sum: x = 294 -6a, where x is angle BFA (arc BA).

2. From the total circle: 72 + arc CD + (2a -5) + x = 360 → arc CD = 360 -72 - (2a -5) -x = 288 -2a +5 -x = 293 -2a -x.

But angle CFD is arc CD, so angle CFD = 293 -2a -x. 

But from equation 1, x = 294 -6a. Substitute:

angle CFD = 293 -2a -(294 -6a) = 293 -2a -294 +6a = (293 -294) +4a = -1 +4a. 

So angle CFD = 4a -1. 

Wait, but angle CFA is also 4a -1. So angle CFD = angle CFA? That suggests that angle CFD is equal to angle CFA, which would mean arc CD = arc CA. But arc CA is 4a -1, and arc CD is 4a -1. This implies that arc CD = arc CA, which would mean points D and A are symmetric with respect to some axis, but I'm not sure. 

But if angle CFD = 4a -1, and we need to find its measure. But we also have from the angle sum and total circle. 

Wait, but from the total circle equation, we had arc CD = 293 -2a -x, and x = 294 -6a. So angle CFD = 4a -1. 

But how to find a? 

Wait, we also have from angle AFD = 2a -5, which is arc AD. So arc AD = 2a -5. 

But arc AD is part of the total circle. Let me think about the total of arcs. 

If we assume that arc CD = 4a -1 (from angle CFD = 4a -1), and arc DA = 2a -5, then what is the relation between arc CD and arc DA? 

It depends on the overall arrangement. But if I consider that the total of arc BC + arc CD + arc DA + arc AB = 360°. 

But arc AB is x = 294 -6a. 

So:

72 + (4a -1) + (2a -5) + (294 -6a) = 360. 

Calculate this:

72 +4a -1 +2a -5 +294 -6a = 360.

Combine terms:

72 -1 -5 +294 +4a +2a -6a = 360 → 72 -6 +294 +0a = 360 → 360 = 360. 

This is an identity, giving no new information. Hence, this suggests that there are infinitely many solutions unless there's another constraint. 

This implies that the system is underdetermined, and we need another equation to solve for a. 

But where is this missing constraint? 

Wait, the problem states that B, C, D, A are on the circle. But there's also the possibility that some of the angles are supplementary or related via other properties. 

Wait, maybe there's another relationship between the angles. For example, since all points are on the circle, certain angles might be supplementary or related to other angles. 

Alternatively, since F is the center, all radii are equal, so triangles FAB, FBC, FCD, FDA are all isoceles. 

But I'm not seeing how that helps yet. 

Wait, but we have angle CFD = 4a -1, and angle CFA = 4a -1. So angle CFD = angle CFA. This suggests that arc CD = arc CA, which would mean that points D and A are symmetric with respect to the axis through F and the midpoint of arc CA. 

But without more info, this might not help. 

Alternatively, since angle BFC is 72°, and angle CFD is 4a -1, and angle AFD is 2a -5, maybe there's a relation between these angles. 

Wait, looking at the diagram, if points are arranged such that B, C, D, A are on the circle, then the angles at F might form parts of the circle. 

But I'm stuck. Let me try to find another equation. 

We know that angle AFD is 2a -5, which is arc AD. And angle CFD is 4a -1, which is arc CD. If I can relate arc AD and arc CD, perhaps through other arcs. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's difficult. 

Wait, perhaps the sum of angles around point F. Let me think: the angles at F are angle BFC (72°), angle CFA (4a-1), angle AFD (2a-5), and angle BFA (x). These four angles sum to 360°. 

But also, since the points are on the circle, the angles around F must account for all the arcs. 

But I've already used that. 

Wait, maybe there's another relationship between angle BFA and other angles. For example, if I consider triangle BFA, but since it's a triangle with two sides as radii, it's an isoceles triangle. But I don't know if that helps. 

Alternatively, since all points are on the circle, the sum of opposite angles might relate. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since the problem involves finding angle CFD, and we have angle CFD = 4a -1, and we need to find its measure. But how?

Wait, from earlier, angle CFD = 4a -1, and angle CFA is also 4a -1. So if angle CFD = angle CFA, then arc CD = arc CA. This implies that arc CD = arc CA = 4a -1. 

But arc CA is also equal to arc CD + arc DA if D is between C and A. So:

arc CD + arc DA = arc CA → (4a -1) + (2a -5) = 4a -1 → 6a -6 = 4a -1 → 2a = 5 → a = 2.5. 

This gives a = 2.5, which makes arc DA = 2*2.5 -5 = 0, which is impossible. 

But if arc DA is zero, it suggests D and A are the same point, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that my assumption that arc CD + arc DA = arc CA is incorrect. 

Therefore, arc CA must be the other arc, the major arc. If arc CA is the major arc, then it would be 360° - arc CA_minor. 

But this complicates things further. 

At this point, I realize I'm going in circles. Maybe I should look at the answer choices and work backward. The options are 115, 119, 120, 123. Let me assume that angle CFD is one of these. 

If angle CFD is 120°, then 4a -1 = 120 → 4a = 121 → a = 30.25. 

Then, angle AFD = 2a -5 = 60.5 -5 = 55.5°. 

Then, from the angle sum equation: x = 294 -6a = 294 -6*30.25 = 294 -181.5 = 112.5°. 

Now, check if this fits with the total circle. 

arc CD = 4a -1 = 120°, arc DA = 55.5°, arc BC = 72°, arc BA = x = 112.5°. Total: 72 + 120 + 55.5 + 112.5 = 72 + 120 = 192; 55.5 + 112.5 = 168; total 192 + 168 = 360. Perfect! 

This works! So a = 30.25, angle CFD = 120°, which is option C. 

But how did I arrive at this? By assuming angle CFD is 120° and checking if it satisfies the conditions. 

But how to derive this systematically? 

Since angle CFD = 4a -1, and we found that when a = 30.25, it gives 120°, and the other angles fit. 

But why is angle CFD = 4a -1? Earlier, I thought it was arc CD = 4a -1, but that led to contradictions. But in this scenario, it worked out. 

Wait, let me explain. If angle CFD = 4a -1, and angle CFA = 4a -1, then arc CD = arc CA. But if arc CA is the major arc, then arc CA = 360 - arc CA_minor. 

But if arc CA_minor = 4a -1, then arc CA_major = 360 - (4a -1). But this is getting too abstract. 

However, in this case, assuming angle CFD = 120° (option C), which gives a = 30.25, and all other angles add up correctly, it seems plausible. 

Thus, the correct answer is C: 120°.
