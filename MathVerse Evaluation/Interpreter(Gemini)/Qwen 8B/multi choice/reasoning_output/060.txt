Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have two lines AB and CD that are parallel. Angle 2 measures 135 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 1. The answer choices are A:30°, B:45°, C:60°, D:75°.

First, I need to visualize the diagram. Since AB is parallel to CD, maybe they're cut by a transversal? But the problem mentions angles 1 and 2. Wait, but there are only two points mentioned for each line. Let me think. Maybe there's a transversal intersecting both lines, creating some angles. But without seeing the figure, I have to assume standard configurations.

In parallel line problems, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles come into play. Since angle 2 is given as 135°, perhaps it's one of those angles formed by a transversal. Let's consider that.

If AB || CD, and a transversal crosses them, forming angles. Suppose angle 2 is at the intersection of the transversal with line CD. Then, depending on where angle 1 is located, its measure could relate to angle 2 via the properties of parallel lines.

Wait, angle 2 being 135° suggests it's an obtuse angle. In such cases, adjacent angles would be supplementary. For example, if angle 2 is on one side of the transversal, its adjacent angle would be 180° - 135° = 45°. That might be angle 1 if they are consecutive interior angles or something like that.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is a same-side exterior angle, then angle 1 might be a corresponding angle. Let me recall: when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal. Alternate interior angles are equal. Consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

So if angle 2 is 135°, and if angle 1 is a consecutive interior angle with angle 2, then angle 1 would be 180° - 135° = 45°, which is option B. Alternatively, if angle 1 is vertical or corresponding, then it might be equal to another angle.

But since the problem refers to angle 1 and angle 2, maybe they are on different lines. Let me try to imagine. Suppose lines AB and CD are horizontal, with AB above CD. A transversal crossing them might form various angles. If angle 2 is on line CD, say, at point D, then angle 2 could be an exterior angle. Then angle 1 could be an interior angle on the other line, making them supplementary. 

Another possibility: angle 2 could be an angle formed by the transversal with line AB, so if AB is parallel to CD, then the corresponding angle on line CD would be equal. But angle 2 is given as 135°, so maybe angle 1 is the corresponding angle, making it also 135°, but that's not among the options. Wait, but maybe angle 1 is supplementary to angle 2?

Wait, if angle 2 is 135°, and angle 1 is adjacent to it along the transversal, then they would add up to 180°, making angle 1 = 45°, which is option B. That seems plausible. Let me check again.

Suppose the transversal intersects AB at point A and CD at point C. Then angle 2 could be at point C, and angle 1 at point A. If they are consecutive interior angles, they should be supplementary. Hence, angle 1 + angle 2 = 180°, so angle 1 = 180 - 135 = 45°, which is option B. Therefore, the answer should be B.
