MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question says that there are two parallel lines, a and b, and another line c that intersects both of them. They mention angle 1 is 55 degrees, and we need to find angle 2. The answer choices are A to D.

First, I remember that when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, there are several angle relationships. Like corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles. Since line c is intersecting both parallel lines a and b, those angles formed should have some relationship.

Let me visualize it. Line a is parallel to line b, and line c is cutting through both. So, if angle 1 is one of the angles formed at the intersection, maybe it's either corresponding or alternate with angle 2. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify where exactly angle 1 and angle 2 are located. But since they're talking about angle 1 being 55 degrees, perhaps angle 2 is either vertical angles, corresponding, or supplementary?

Wait, in such cases, when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. That means they add up to 180 degrees. So if angle 1 is 55 degrees, then the adjacent angle on the same side would be 180 - 55 = 125 degrees. But angle 2 could be that 125 degrees? Or maybe it's an alternate interior angle?

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 2 are on different sides, maybe they are equal. But wait, if they are corresponding angles, they'd be equal. However, depending on where they are placed. Let me think again.

Suppose line c intersects line a at point X and line b at point Y. Then, angle 1 could be at point X, say, between line a and line c. Then, angle 2 might be at point Y, but on the other side. If angle 1 is 55 degrees, then the corresponding angle at Y would also be 55 degrees. But if angle 2 is the consecutive interior angle, then it would be supplementary. 

But the problem states that angle 1 is 55 degrees. Depending on whether angle 2 is corresponding or consecutive. For example, if angle 1 and angle 2 are consecutive interior angles, then they sum to 180. So angle 2 would be 180 - 55 = 125 degrees. Alternatively, if they are vertical angles or corresponding, they would be equal. But without knowing the diagram, how do we know?

Wait, the problem mentions that line c intersects both a and b. So angle 1 and angle 2 are likely to be on different lines. Suppose angle 1 is on line a and angle 2 is on line b. If they are alternate interior angles, then they would be equal. But if they are consecutive interior, then supplementary. Hmm.

But the answer options include 55, 35, 125, 65. Let's think. If angle 1 is 55 degrees, then its consecutive interior angle would be 125 degrees. So if angle 2 is that consecutive angle, then answer C (125). Alternatively, if angle 2 is an alternate interior angle, then it would be 55 degrees (option A). But the problem probably refers to consecutive angles because the way the question is phrased. Also, since the answer includes 125, which is 180-55, that seems more likely.

Wait, but how can we tell? Maybe looking back at the given predicates. The problem gives Parallel(Line(a), Line(b)) and IntersectAt(Line(c), Line(a), Point(...)) and IntersectAt(Line(c), Line(b), Point(...)). So line c is a transversal. Now, angle 1 and angle 2—maybe they are consecutive interior angles. Because if you imagine the transversal crossing two parallel lines, the angles on the same side are supplementary. Therefore, angle 1 + angle 2 = 180. Hence, angle 2 = 180 - 55 = 125 degrees. Which is option C.

Alternatively, if angle 2 was an alternate interior angle, then it would be equal to angle 1. But why would the question give angle 1 as 55 and ask for angle 2, implying they are different? Unless angle 2 is something else. Wait, maybe angle 1 is a corresponding angle, so angle 2 is equal. But then answer A. But the answer options have both possibilities.

But in standard problems like this, when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So unless specified otherwise, angle 2 is likely to be the consecutive one. So 180-55=125. Therefore, answer C. Let me check the answer choices again. Yes, option C is 125. So the answer is C.
