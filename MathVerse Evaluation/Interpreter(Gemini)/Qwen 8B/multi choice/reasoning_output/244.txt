====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and visualize the figure based on the predicates provided.

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E. Lines connecting them: AB, BC, CD, DE, EA, BE, and EC. Also, there are several angles mentioned: Angle(1) to Angle(9). The measures given are m∠1=58°, m∠2=47°, m∠3=26°, and EC is parallel to AB. We're supposed to find the measure of ∠5.

First, let me sketch the figure mentally. Points A, B, C, D, E connected in some way. Let me note the lines again: AB, BC, CD, DE, EA form a pentagon? Wait, but also BE and EC are lines. So maybe it's a combination of polygons. Let me think about the triangles mentioned: Triangle ABC, Triangle EBC, Triangle ECD. And other triangles like ABE.

Given that EC is parallel to AB. Since AB and EC are parallel, that suggests that maybe there are some alternate interior angles or corresponding angles involved. Also, since there's a line BE connecting B to E, which might create transversals with the parallel lines.

Now, looking at the angles given: Angles 1, 2, 3 are measured. Let me check where these angles are located. The problem mentions Angle(1) has measure 58, Angle(2)=47, Angle(3)=26. But without seeing the diagram, I need to infer based on the given lines and triangles.

Looking at the triangles mentioned: Triangle ABC, so angles at A, B, C. Also, Triangle EBC, which would involve points E, B, C. Then Triangle ECD involving E, C, D. Also, Triangle ABE, since there's a mention of Triangle(A,B,E).

Let me consider the lines and how they connect. AB is connected to BC, which connects to CD, then DE, then back to EA. So the main polygon seems to be a pentagon A-B-C-D-E-A. Additionally, there's a line BE connecting B to E, and EC connecting E to C. So point E is connected to C, forming another triangle with B.

Since EC is parallel to AB, perhaps there's a transversal cutting through them. For example, if we consider BE as a transversal intersecting AB and EC. That could create some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles.

Also, given that there are several angles defined, like Angle(1), Angle(2), Angle(3), etc., each with specific measures. The problem asks for ∠5. So I need to figure out which angle corresponds to ∠5 based on the setup.

Wait, the user hasn't provided a diagram, so I need to deduce based on standard configurations. Let me try to reconstruct the figure step by step.

Starting with points A, B, C, D, E. Let me assume that AB is horizontal, and EC is parallel to AB. Let me imagine AB as a horizontal line, and EC as another horizontal line somewhere else. Then, points B and E are connected by a line BE. Point C is connected to D via CD, and D to E via DE.

Let me think about the triangles. Triangle ABC: points A, B, C. So AB is one side, BC another, and AC the third. Then Triangle EBC: points E, B, C. So EB, BC, EC. Since EC is parallel to AB, and BC is common to both triangles. Maybe there are some similar triangles here?

Alternatively, considering that EC || AB, and BE is a transversal. Then, the angles formed at B and E might be related. For instance, if BE intersects AB at B and EC at E, then the corresponding angles could be equal. 

But first, let's look at the given angle measures. The problem states that m∠1 = 58°, m∠2 = 47°, m∠3 = 26°. These angles are likely part of various triangles. Let me check the given predicates again.

There's a predicate that says Triangle(A,B,E), so that's triangle ABE. Also, Triangle(E,B,C) and Triangle(E,C,D). Also, Triangle(A,B,C). 

Another predicate: Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(4))), MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,E))). So the sum of angles 2, 3, and 4 equals the measure of angle BCE (since Angle(B,C,E) is the same as angle at B in triangle BEC? Or wait, angle BCE would be at point C? Wait, Angle(B,C,E) refers to the angle at point C between points B, C, E. So that's angle BCE. 

So the sum of angles 2, 3, and 4 equals the measure of angle BCE. Let me note that down. Let me denote the measure of angle 2 as 47°, angle 3 as 26°, and angle 4 as... Well, the measure of angle 4 is equal to measure of angle 2, according to the predicate: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), MeasureOf(Angle(2))). So angle 4 is 47°. Therefore, the sum of angles 2 (47°), 3 (26°), and 4 (47°) is 47 + 26 + 47 = 120°, which equals the measure of angle BCE. So angle BCE is 120 degrees.

But angle BCE is part of triangle EBC. In triangle EBC, the angles are at points E, B, and C. So angle at B is angle EBC, angle at C is angle BCE (which we found as 120°), and angle at E is angle BEC. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so angle EBC + angle BEC + angle BCE = 180°. We know angle BCE is 120°, so angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°. 

But how does this relate to the other angles given?

Also, since EC is parallel to AB, and BE is a transversal, then the corresponding angles should be equal. For example, angle at B between AB and BE (let's call that angle ABE) would correspond to angle at E between EC and BE (angle BEC). Because AB || EC, and BE is a transversal, so angle ABE ≅ angle BEC. 

Wait, if AB is parallel to EC, then the transversal BE creates corresponding angles. So angle between AB and BE at B (angle ABE) is equal to angle between EC and BE at E (angle BEC). So angle ABE = angle BEC. 

But earlier, in triangle EBC, angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°. However, angle EBC is part of triangle ABC as well. Let me think about triangle ABC. It's given as Triangle(A,B,C), so its angles are at points A, B, C. The measure of angle at B in triangle ABC would be angle ABC. But angle ABC is adjacent to angle ABE if E is connected to B. Wait, maybe angle ABC is split into two parts by BE? 

Alternatively, if BE is drawn from B to E, then angle ABC could be composed of angles ABE and EBC. Let me clarify. Suppose point E is outside triangle ABC. Then, BE divides angle ABC into two parts: angle ABE and angle EBC. So angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC. 

Earlier, in triangle EBC, angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°, and angle BEC equals angle ABE because of the parallel lines. So substituting, angle ABE + angle EBC = angle ABC. But angle ABE = angle BEC, so angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°, and angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC. But angle ABE = angle BEC, so angle ABC = angle BEC + angle EBC = 60°. So angle ABC is 60°. 

Therefore, angle ABC is 60 degrees. Now, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is 180°, so angle at A (angle BAC) + angle ABC (60°) + angle at C (angle BCA) = 180°. So angle BAC + angle BCA = 120°. 

But do we have information about those angles? Let me check the given angles. The problem mentions angles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. From the predicates, we have MeasureOf(Angle(1)) is 58°, Angle(2) is 47°, Angle(3) is 26°, and Angle(4) is 47°, Angle(6) is 58°, and others. 

Wait, the problem says "Connect BE" and asks for measure of ∠5. So ∠5 is probably referring to one of the angles in the figure. Let me try to map the angles to the given ones.

Assuming that Angle(1) is angle at A in triangle ABC? Or maybe another angle. Alternatively, since EC is parallel to AB, and BE is a transversal, creating angles that might relate to the given measures.

Alternatively, considering triangle ABE. Since AB is parallel to EC, and BE is a transversal, then angle ABE (at B) is equal to angle BEC (at E). As previously established. 

Also, there's a triangle ABE mentioned. Let's consider its angles. In triangle ABE, angles at A, B, E. If we can find some relations here. 

Additionally, there's a triangle ECD mentioned. So points E, C, D. Since CD is connected to D, and DE is connected to E. Given that EC is parallel to AB, and CD is connected to D. 

But maybe I need to focus more on the angles given. Let me list all the given angle measures:

- Angle(1): 58°
- Angle(2): 47°
- Angle(3): 26°
- Angle(4): 47° (equal to angle 2)
- Angle(6): 58° (equal to angle 1)
- Others may be related through the triangles.

Also, there's a predicate that says SumOf(Angle(2), Angle(3), Angle(4)) equals measure of angle BCE. Which we already used to find angle BCE as 120°, leading to angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°, and angle ABC being 60°, as per earlier reasoning.

Now, angle ABC is 60°, which is part of triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, angles at A, B, and C. Let me see if we can find other angles here. If angle ABC is 60°, then angle BAC + angle BCA = 120°. 

Are any of the given angles part of triangle ABC? For example, angle(1) is 58°, which could be angle BAC or angle BCA. Similarly, angle(2) is 47°, angle(3) is 26°, etc. 

But how to determine which angles correspond to which. Let me think about the triangles and the angles mentioned. 

For instance, Triangle(A,B,E): angles at A, B, E. If angle ABE is equal to angle BEC (as discussed due to parallel lines), and angle ABE is part of triangle ABE. 

Also, there's a triangle EBC with angles at E, B, C. We've determined angle BCE is 120°, and angles at B and E add up to 60°. 

Perhaps angle(1) is angle at A in triangle ABC? Let me suppose that angle(1) is angle BAC. If that's the case, then angle BAC = 58°, and angle BCA would be 120° - 58° = 62°. But then angle(2) is 47°, angle(3) is 26°, which might relate to other angles. 

Alternatively, maybe angle(1) is part of triangle ABE. For example, angle at E in triangle ABE. 

This is getting complicated without the diagram. Let me try another approach.

We know that EC || AB. Let me consider the transversal BE. So, angle between AB and BE at B (angle ABE) is equal to the angle between EC and BE at E (angle BEC), because they are corresponding angles. So angle ABE = angle BEC.

In triangle EBC, angles at B (EBC), at C (BEC?), wait, no. Let me clarify the angles in triangle EBC. The vertices are E, B, C. So the angles are:

At point E: angle BEC

At point B: angle EBC

At point C: angle ECB (which is angle BCE, which we said was 120°)

Earlier, we had that angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°, because angle BCE is 120°, and total in triangle is 180. So angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°. Also, angle ABE = angle BEC.

But angle ABE is part of triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, angles are at A, B, E. So angle at B is angle ABE, angle at E is angle AEB, and angle at A is angle BAE. Their sum is 180°. 

But we don't know much about triangle ABE yet. However, since AB is parallel to EC, and BE is a transversal, we also have that angle ABE (at B) is equal to angle BEC (at E), as corresponding angles. So angle BEC = angle ABE. 

From earlier, angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°, and angle BEC = angle ABE. So angle EBC + angle ABE = 60°. But angle ABE + angle EBC is angle ABC, which we found earlier as 60°, confirming that angle ABC is 60°. 

Now, going back to triangle ABC, which has angles at A, B, C. We know angle at B is 60°, so angles at A and C add up to 120°. 

Now, looking at the given angles: 58°, 47°, 26°, and others. Let me think if any of these could be angles at A or C in triangle ABC. 

Suppose angle BAC is 58° (angle 1), then angle BCA would be 120° - 58° = 62°. But none of the given angles are 62°, so maybe not. 

Alternatively, angle BCA is 58°, making angle BAC = 62°. Still doesn't match. 

Alternatively, maybe angle at A in triangle ABC is angle BAC, which is part of another structure. Let me think about other triangles. There's triangle ABE. If angle at A in triangle ABE is angle BAE, which could be related to angle BAC. 

Alternatively, since EC is parallel to AB, and there's a line CD connected to D, which is connected to E. So maybe there are other triangles or parallelograms. 

Alternatively, looking at triangle ECD. Points E, C, D. Since EC is parallel to AB, and CD is connected. Not sure yet. 

Wait, there's also a triangle ECD mentioned. Let me consider that. In triangle ECD, angles at E, C, D. We might need to use some properties here. But without knowing the angles, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, maybe angle(5) is the angle at E in triangle ABE or something else. 

Wait, the problem asks for the measure of angle 5. The given angles are numbered 1-9, with 1,2,3,4,6 having measures given. So angle 5 is missing. 

Let me try to find relations between the given angles and angle 5. 

Let me recall that in triangle EBC, angle BCE is 120°, and angles at B and E are 60° in total. Also, angle ABE = angle BEC (due to parallel lines). Let me denote angle BEC as x. Then angle EBC is 60° - x. 

Also, angle ABE = x. 

In triangle ABE, angles are angle ABE = x, angle at E is angle AEB, and angle at A is angle BAE. Their sum is 180°, so x + angle AEB + angle BAE = 180°. 

But without more info, it's tricky. 

Wait, but there's another relation. The problem mentions Triangle(A,B,E), and possibly other triangles. Also, there's a statement that Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), MeasureOf(Angle(3)), MeasureOf(Angle(4))), MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,E))). As before, this gives us angle BCE = 120°, which is angle at C in triangle EBC. 

Let me check if angle(2), angle(3), and angle(4) are related to other angles in the figure. 

Angle(2) is 47°, angle(3) is 26°, angle(4) is 47° (equal to angle 2). So their sum is 47+26+47=120°, which equals angle BCE (angle at C in triangle EBC). 

So, in triangle EBC, angle at C is 120°, and the other two angles sum to 60°. 

Now, if I can find expressions for those angles in terms of other angles. 

Let me think about triangle EBC again. At point B, angle EBC = 60° - x, where x is angle BEC (same as angle ABE). 

Now, angle EBC is part of triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle at B is angle ABC, which we determined earlier as 60°, so angle ABC = angle ABE + angle EBC = x + (60° - x) = 60°, which checks out. 

Now, what about other angles? Let me consider triangle ABC. Its angles are angle BAC, angle ABC=60°, and angle BCA. 

If angle BAC is one of the given angles, like angle 1 (58°), then angle BCA would be 120° - 58° = 62°. But angle BCA is also part of triangle ECD? Or maybe not. 

Alternatively, angle BCA could be part of triangle ECD. Let me think about that. 

Point C is connected to D and E. So triangle ECD has angles at E, C, D. If we can find some relations here. 

But without knowing the configuration of D, it's challenging. 

Wait, there's a line CD connected to D, and line DE connected to E. So D is connected to C and E, forming line CD and DE. So D is a point such that CD and DE are sides of the pentagon. 

Now, since EC is parallel to AB, and CD is connected to D, maybe there's a way to relate angles here. 

Alternatively, let me consider the entire figure. Since AB is parallel to EC, and BE is a transversal, we have that angle ABE = angle BEC (x). Also, angle at E in triangle ABE is angle AEB. 

But how to find x? 

Maybe using other given angles. 

Let me think about triangle ABE. Its angles are x (at B), angle AEB, and angle BAE. Their sum is 180°. 

If I can express angle BAE or angle AEB in terms of other angles. 

Alternatively, consider triangle AED or something else. 

Wait, there's also triangle ECD. Let me think about that. In triangle ECD, angles at E, C, D. If we can find some relations here. 

But I'm stuck. Let me try to find angle 5. 

The problem asks for the measure of angle 5. The given angles are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Let me check what angle 5 could refer to. 

Possibly, angle 5 is one of the angles in triangle ABE or elsewhere. 

Wait, let me consider the angles in triangle ABE. Let me assume that angle at E in triangle ABE is angle AEB. This angle might be related to other angles. 

If I can find angle AEB, that could be angle 5. 

Alternatively, angle at A in triangle ABE, which is angle BAE, could be angle 5. 

But without knowing which angle is which, it's hard. 

Wait, the problem mentions that there are angles labeled 1 through 9. Perhaps angle 5 is the angle at E in triangle EBC, which is angle BEC, which we denoted as x. 

Earlier, we had angle BEC = x, and angle EBC = 60° - x. 

If we can find x, that would give us angle BEC, which might be angle 5. 

How to find x? 

Let me think about triangle ABE. In triangle ABE, angles are x (at B), angle AEB, and angle BAE. Their sum is 180°. So x + angle AEB + angle BAE = 180°. 

But what about angle BAE? Is it related to other angles? 

In triangle ABC, angle BAC is either angle BAE or part of it. If BE splits angle BAC, then angle BAC = angle BAE + angle EAC, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since AB is parallel to EC, and AE is a line connecting A to E, maybe there are some alternate interior angles. 

For example, line AE intersects AB and EC. Wait, AE is connected to A and E. Since AB is parallel to EC, and AE is a transversal, then angle between AE and AB at A (which is angle BAE) is equal to angle between AE and EC at E (which is angle AEC). 

Wait, yes! Because AB || EC, and AE is a transversal, so alternate interior angles are equal. So angle BAE (at A) equals angle AEC (at E). 

So angle BAE = angle AEC. 

Let me denote angle BAE as y, so angle AEC = y. 

Then, in triangle ABE, angles are x (at B), y (at A), and angle AEB. Their sum is 180°, so x + y + angle AEB = 180°. 

But angle AEB is also part of triangle AEC or something else. 

Alternatively, consider triangle AEC. Points A, E, C. Since EC is parallel to AB, and AE is a line. 

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about triangle AEC. 

Alternatively, consider that angle AEC is equal to angle BAE (y), and angle AEC is part of triangle AEC. 

But without knowing more angles in triangle AEC, it's still difficult. 

However, let me think about the sum of angles around point E. 

At point E, there are several angles: angle AEB, angle BEC, and angle AEC. Wait, depending on the connections. 

If points A, E, C are connected, then at point E, angles are:

- Between A and B: angle AEB

- Between B and C: angle BEC

- Between C and A: angle AEC (if connected directly)

But since there's a line from E to C and from E to A, and also from E to B, the angles around E would depend on the configuration. 

But assuming that the figure is a pentagon A-B-C-D-E-A, with diagonals BE and EC, then at point E, the angles would be angle AEB, angle BEC, and angle CED or something else. 

But this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to find another approach. 

Let me go back to triangle ABC. We know angle ABC is 60°, and angles at A and C add to 120°. Suppose one of these angles is 58°, which is angle 1. If angle BAC is 58°, then angle BCA would be 120° - 58° = 62°. 

Is 62° related to any of the given angles? No, unless it's angle 5. But 62 isn't among the options. The options are A:43, B:47, C:58, D:73. 

Wait, but maybe angle BCA (which would be 62°) is related to other angles. For example, if there's a triangle involving point D. 

Point D is connected to C and E. So CD and DE. So triangle CDE? Or ECD. 

In triangle ECD, angles at E, C, D. If angle at C is angle ECD, which is part of angle BCA (from triangle ABC). Since EC is parallel to AB, and CD is connected to C, maybe angle ECD relates to angle CAB. 

Because EC || AB, and CD is a transversal. So angle between EC and CD at C (angle ECD) would be equal to angle between AB and CD at some point. 

Wait, but CD is connected to point D, which is connected to E. Without knowing where D is, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, since EC || AB, and CD is connected to C, which is part of AB's extension? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since EC || AB, and AB is a side of the pentagon, while EC is another side. 

This is quite challenging without the diagram. Let me try to make assumptions based on standard problems. 

In many cases, when two lines are parallel and a transversal is present, the alternate interior angles are equal. Also, sometimes vertical angles or supplementary angles come into play. 

Given that, and the presence of angles 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, etc., maybe angle 5 is the supplement of one of the given angles. 

Wait, another thought: since angle BCE is 120°, which is the sum of angles 2, 3, 4 (47+26+47=120). So angle BCE is 120°, which is part of triangle EBC. 

In triangle EBC, angles at B and E add to 60°, as mentioned earlier. 

If angle at B is angle EBC, which is part of angle ABC (which is 60°), and angle at E is angle BEC, which is equal to angle ABE. 

If I can find angle ABE, which is equal to angle BEC, and then find angle at E in triangle ABE, which might be angle AEB. 

Wait, in triangle ABE, angles are x (ABE), y (BAE), and z (AEB), with x + y + z = 180. Also, y = angle AEC (alternate interior angles). 

But angle AEC is part of triangle AEC. If I can find angle AEC, maybe through other means. 

Alternatively, consider that angle AEC is supplementary to angle BEC if points A, E, and C are arranged in a certain way. 

Wait, if AB || EC, and AE is a transversal, then angle BAE (y) equals angle AEC (y). Also, angle AEB is part of triangle ABE. 

But without more info, I'm stuck. 

Wait, let me think about the sum of angles around point E. At point E, there are angles: angle AEB, angle BEC, and angle CED (assuming D is connected to E). But since DE is a line, and CD is connected to D, maybe angle CED is part of triangle CDE. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to proceed. 

Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

- angle BCE = 120°
- angle ABC = 60°
- angle ABE = angle BEC = x
- angle EBC = 60° - x
- In triangle ABC, angle BAC + angle BCA = 120°
- In triangle ABE, x + y + z = 180°, where y = angle BAE, z = angle AEB
- y = angle AEC (alternate interior angles due to AB || EC)
- angle AEC is part of triangle AEC, which might involve other angles...

Alternatively, since angle AEC = y, and if there's a line from E to D, which is connected to C, then angle AEC could be related to angle CED or something else. 

Alternatively, since CD is connected to D and E, and EC is parallel to AB, maybe angle ECD is equal to angle BAD or something. 

But I'm running out of ideas. Let me try to think about the given answer choices: 43, 47, 58, 73. 

Since angle 5 is requested, and the given angles are 1-4 and 6, which are 58, 47, 26, 47, and 58. The missing angle could be 43, which is 180 - 137, or some calculation involving the given angles. 

Wait, earlier, in triangle EBC, angles at B and E add to 60°. If one of these is angle 5, then it depends on which one. 

If angle BEC (which is x) is angle 5, then we need to find x. How? 

If I can find angle ABE, which is x, then x is angle 5. 

To find x, maybe using triangle ABE. 

But I need more info about triangle ABE. 

Wait, in triangle ABE, angle at A is y = angle BAE, which equals angle AEC (due to parallel lines). If I can find angle AEC, then I can find y. 

Angle AEC is part of triangle AEC. Let me consider triangle AEC. Points A, E, C. What's known about this triangle? 

It has sides AE, EC, and AC. We know EC is parallel to AB, and AE is a line. 

But without more info about the lengths or other angles, it's hard to say. 

Wait, but angle at C in triangle AEC is angle ACE, which is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC. Earlier, we said angle BCA is 120° - angle BAC. If angle BAC is angle 1 (58°), then angle BCA is 62°, which would be angle ACE. 

So angle ACE = 62°, and in triangle AEC, angles are at A (y), at C (62°), and at E (z). So y + z + 62° = 180° → y + z = 118°. 

But in triangle ABE, we have x + y + z = 180°, and we also have y = angle AEC = z (wait, no: angle AEC is y, and z is angle AEB. Wait, no, in triangle AEC, angle at E is angle AEC = y, and in triangle ABE, angle at E is angle AEB = z. Are these related? 

Yes! Because at point E, angles around E include angle AEB (z) and angle AEC (y). Depending on the configuration, these could be supplementary or something else. 

If points A, E, C are arranged such that angles at E (AEB and AEC) are adjacent, then z + y = 180°. 

So, from triangle AEC: y + z = 118°, and from the adjacent angles at E: y + z = 180°. This would imply 118° = 180°, which is impossible. So my assumption must be wrong. 

Ah, so my mistake is in assuming that y and z are adjacent. Perhaps they are not. Maybe angle AEC is part of another structure. 

Let me rethink. If AB || EC, and AE is a transversal, then angle BAE (y) equals angle AEC (y). So angle AEC = y. 

In triangle AEC, angles are at A (y), at C (let's say w), and at E (angle AEC = y). Wait, no. Wait, in triangle AEC, the angles are at A, E, C. 

So angle at A: angle CAE = y (from alternate interior angles), angle at E: angle AEC = ?, and angle at C: angle ACE = ?. 

Wait, I'm confused. Let me define properly:

- Alternate interior angles: since AB || EC, and AE is a transversal, then angle BAE (at A) is equal to angle AEC (at E). So angle BAE = angle AEC = y. 

Thus, in triangle AEC, angle at E is y, angle at A is something else? No, angle at A is angle BAE = y. 

Wait, no. In triangle AEC, the angles are:

- At A: angle CAE (which is angle BAE, since AE is the same line)

- At E: angle AEC

- At C: angle ACE

So in triangle AEC, angles are y (at A), y (at E), and angle ACE (at C). Wait, that would mean y + y + angle ACE = 180° → 2y + angle ACE = 180°. 

But angle ACE is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC. Earlier, we assumed angle BCA is 62° if angle BAC is 58°, but that depends on whether angle BAC is 58°. 

Let me assume angle BAC is angle 1 = 58°, so angle BAC = 58°, which is angle CAE = y. So y = 58°. 

Then, in triangle AEC, 2*58 + angle ACE = 180 → 116 + angle ACE = 180 → angle ACE = 64°. 

But angle ACE is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC. So angle BCA = angle ACE = 64°, and angle BAC = 58°, so angle ABC = 60°, as before. 

Sum of angles in triangle ABC: 58 + 60 + 64 = 182°, which is not possible. So this leads to a contradiction. Hence, my assumption that angle BAC is 58° must be incorrect. 

So, angle BAC cannot be 58°. Let me try another possibility. 

Suppose angle BCA is 58°, which would make angle BAC = 120° - 58° = 62°. 

So angle BAC = 62°, which would be angle CAE = y. 

Then in triangle AEC, 2y + angle ACE = 180 → 2*62 + angle ACE = 180 → 124 + angle ACE = 180 → angle ACE = 56°. 

Now, angle ACE = 56°, which is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC. But angle BCA is 58°, so this implies that angle ACE is 56°, leaving a remaining angle of 2°, which doesn't make sense. Hmm, not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe angle BAC is angle 2 (47°)? Let's try that. 

If angle BAC = 47°, then angle BCA = 120° - 47° = 73°. 

So angle BAC = 47° = y. 

In triangle AEC: 2y + angle ACE = 180 → 2*47 + angle ACE = 180 → 94 + angle ACE = 180 → angle ACE = 86°. 

But angle ACE is part of angle BCA (73°), which would require angle ACE = 73°, but we get 86°, which is inconsistent. 

Hmm, not working. 

Maybe angle BAC is angle 3 (26°)? Then angle BCA = 120 - 26 = 94°. 

In triangle AEC: 2*26 + angle ACE = 180 → 52 + angle ACE = 180 → angle ACE = 128°, which is greater than angle BCA (94°), impossible. 

Not working. 

What if angle BAC is angle 4 (47°)? Same as above. 

Same issue. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle BAC is angle 6 (58°)? Which is same as angle 1. 

Which led to inconsistency earlier. 

So this suggests that my assumption that angle BAE = angle AEC (y) is wrong. 

Wait, why did I think that? Because AB || EC, and AE is a transversal. But if AE is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would be angle BAE (at A) and angle AEC (at E). But this assumes that AE crosses EC and AB. 

But if AE is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would be between AB and EC, with the transversal AE. So yes, angle BAE (between AB and AE) should equal angle AEC (between EC and AE). 

But if this leads to contradictions, maybe there's an error in the assumption. 

Wait, let me re-examine the configuration. 

Points A and E are connected by a line AE. AB is parallel to EC. So AE is a transversal crossing AB and EC. 

So, at point A, the angle between AB and AE is angle BAE. 

At point E, the angle between EC and AE is angle AEC. 

These should be equal because AB || EC and AE is a transversal. 

So angle BAE = angle AEC. 

But this led to inconsistencies in previous calculations. Why? 

Maybe because I incorrectly assumed that angle BAC is angle BAE. 

Wait, angle BAC is the angle at A between BA and CA. While angle BAE is the angle at A between BA and AE. So unless E lies on AC, these are different angles. 

Ah! Here's the mistake. I assumed angle BAE is the same as angle BAC, but that's only true if E lies on AC, which it doesn't necessarily. 

So, angle BAE is a separate angle from angle BAC. 

This changes things. 

So, angle BAE is part of angle BAC if E is inside the triangle ABC. But since E is connected to B and C, it's possible that E is outside the triangle ABC, making angle BAE and angle BAC unrelated. 

This explains why the previous calculations were leading to inconsistencies. 

So, let's start over with this new understanding. 

We have angle BAE = angle AEC (due to AB || EC and AE as transversal). 

Let me denote angle BAE = y, so angle AEC = y. 

In triangle ABE, angles are at A (y), at B (x), and at E (z), with x + y + z = 180°. 

Also, in triangle AEC, angles are at A (y), at E (y), and at C (w), with y + y + w = 180° → 2y + w = 180°. 

So w = 180° - 2y. 

But w is angle ACE, which is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC. 

In triangle ABC, angle BCA = angle ACE + ... ? 

If point E is outside of triangle ABC, then angle BCA might consist of angle ACE and some other angle. 

For example, if E is outside, then angle BCA could be split into angle ACE and angle ECD or something. 

But without knowing the exact position of E, it's hard to say. 

However, let's assume that angle ACE is part of angle BCA. So angle BCA = angle ACE + something, or angle BCA = angle ACE. 

But this is speculative. 

Let me try to use the fact that in triangle ABC, angle ABC = 60°, and angles at A and C add to 120°. 

Let me denote angle BAC as a, and angle BCA as b. So a + b = 120°. 

Now, angle BAE = y, and angle BAE is part of angle BAC (a) if E is inside the triangle. But if E is outside, it might not be. 

Assume E is outside, so angle BAE is part of a larger angle. 

But this is too vague. 

Let me try to find another relationship. 

From earlier, in triangle EBC, angle BCE = 120°, and angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°. 

Also, angle BEC = x (angle at E in triangle EBC), and angle ABE = x (because AB || EC). 

So, in triangle ABE, x + y + z = 180°, and in triangle AEC, 2y + w = 180°. 

But I need to relate these variables. 

Also, in triangle ABC, a + b = 120°, where a is angle BAC, b is angle BCA. 

If I can express a and b in terms of y and w. 

Assume that angle BAC = a = angle BAE + angle EAC. But without knowing where E is, it's hard. 

Alternatively, if E is positioned such that AE extends from A, passing through E, then angle BAE is part of angle BAC. 

But this requires knowing the exact configuration. 

Since this is taking too long and I need to find angle 5, let me try to make an educated guess based on the given options and the relationships. 

We know that in triangle EBC, angles at B and E add to 60°. If one of these is angle 5, then it depends on which one. 

If angle BEC is angle 5, then it's x. To find x, we need to relate it to other angles. 

In triangle ABE, x + y + z = 180°. 

In triangle AEC, 2y + w = 180°. 

And in triangle ABC, a + b = 120°. 

If I can find a relationship between x, y, and w. 

But this is too abstract. Let me think about the given angles. 

The given angles are 1=58, 2=47, 3=26, 4=47, 6=58. 

Maybe angle 5 is the supplement of one of these. For example, if angle 5 is 180 - (58 + 47) = 75°, but 75 isn't an option. 

Or, if it's 180 - (47 + 26) = 107, nope. 

Alternatively, since angle BCE is 120°, and angle BCE is made up of angles from triangles, maybe angle 5 is part of that. 

Wait, angle BCE is 120°, and it's composed of angle EBC and angle BEC. We know angle EBC + angle BEC = 60°. 

If one of these is angle 5, and the other is another given angle. 

For example, if angle BEC is 58° (angle 6), then angle EBC = 60 - 58 = 2°, which is unlikely. 

Or if angle BEC is 47° (angle 2), then angle EBC = 60 - 47 = 13°, also unlikely. 

Alternatively, angle EBC is 26° (angle 3), then angle BEC = 60 - 26 = 34°, which is not an option. 

None of these match the options. 

Wait, but maybe angle 5 is angle EBC or angle BEC. Let me think. 

If angle BEC is x, and in triangle ABE, x + y + z = 180°. Also, in triangle AEC, 2y + w = 180°. 

If I can find x from these equations. 

But I need more constraints. 

Wait, what if angle AEC is part of the sum of angles in triangle AEC? 

Let me consider that angle AEC = y, and angle ACE = w = 180 - 2y. 

But angle ACE is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC. Let's say angle BCA = angle ACE + angle ECD or something. 

If I assume that angle BCA = angle ACE, then b = w = 180 - 2y. 

Also, in triangle ABC, a + b = 120°, so a = 120 - b = 120 - (180 - 2y) = -60 + 2y. 

But angle a = BAC = -60 + 2y. Since angles can't be negative, this implies 2y > 60 → y > 30°. 

Now, in triangle ABE, x + y + z = 180°. 

But what is z? z is angle AEB. 

At point E, angles around E include angle AEB (z), angle BEC (x), and possibly others. 

If I assume that angle AEC = y, and angle AEC is composed of angle AEB + angle BEC, then y = z + x. 

So, y = z + x. 

Substituting into triangle ABE: x + y + z = 180 → x + (z + x) + z = 180 → 2x + 2z = 180 → x + z = 90°. 

So, x + z = 90°. 

But also, y = z + x, so y = 90°. 

So, y = 90°. 

Then, from earlier, b = 180 - 2y = 180 - 180 = 0°, which is impossible. 

So, this suggests an error in assuming that angle AEC = y = z + x. 

Maybe angle AEC is not the sum of z and x. 

Alternatively, if angle AEC is adjacent to angle AEB and angle BEC, then y = z + x. 

But this led to a contradiction. 

This indicates that my assumptions are flawed. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to look for another approach. 

Let me recall that in the given predicates, there is a triangle ABE, and angle 1 is 58°, angle 2 is 47°, angle 3 is 26°. 

Maybe angle 5 is the remaining angle in some triangle. 

For example, in triangle ABE, if two angles are known, the third can be found. 

But which angles? 

If angle ABE is x, and angle BAE is y, then angle AEB = 180 - x - y. 

But without knowing x or y, it's hard. 

However, if I can relate x to other angles. 

Since AB || EC, and BE is a transversal, angle ABE = angle BEC = x. 

In triangle EBC, angle BEC = x, and angle EBC = 60° - x. 

Now, angle EBC is part of triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle ABC = 60°, which is angle ABE + angle EBC = x + (60 - x) = 60°, which checks out. 

Now, let's consider triangle ABC. It has angles at A, B, C. We know angle at B is 60°. 

Let me assume that one of the given angles is at A or C. 

For example, if angle at A (BAC) is 58°, then angle at C (BCA) = 120° - 58° = 62°. 

Now, in triangle EBC, angle at C is 120°, so angle BCA (62°) is part of angle BCE (120°). This suggests that there's another angle at C, like angle ECD or something. 

But without knowing, it's hard to proceed. 

Alternatively, if angle at C (BCA) is 47°, then angle at A is 120 - 47 = 73°. 

This 73° is one of the answer choices (option D). 

Maybe angle 5 is 73°, which is the measure of angle at A (BAC). 

But how to confirm? 

If angle BAC is 73°, then in triangle ABE, if angle BAE is part of it, and angle ABE = x, and angle AEB = 180 - x - y. 

But without more info, it's hard. 

But given the answer choices, and the fact that 73 is an option, and it's derived from 120 - 47, which are given angles, it might be the correct answer. 

Alternatively, let me think about the sum of angles in triangle ABE. If angle ABE = x, angle AEB = z, and angle BAE = y, with x + y + z = 180. 

If I can find x and y. 

From earlier, angle AEC = y, and in triangle AEC, 2y + w = 180, where w is angle ACE. 

If angle ACE is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC, and if angle BCA is 47°, then w = 47°, so 2y + 47 = 180 → 2y = 133 → y = 66.5°, which is not an option. 

But if angle BCA is 73°, then 2y + 73 = 180 → 2y = 107 → y = 53.5°, also not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle BCA is 26°, then 2y + 26 = 180 → y = 77°, not an option. 

No luck. 

Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll go with the most plausible answer based on the given options and the relationships. Since angle BCE is 120°, and the sum of angles in triangle EBC is 180°, and the other two angles add to 60°, if one of them is 47° (angle 2), the other would be 13°, which is not an option. If one is 26° (angle 3), the other is 34°. If one is 58° (angle 6), the other is 2°. None of these are options. 

Wait, but the question asks for angle 5. Maybe it's the remaining angle in some triangle. 

Let me consider triangle ABE. If I can find two angles, I can find the third. 

Suppose angle ABE = x, angle AEB = z, and angle BAE = y. 

If I can find x or y. 

From earlier, angle ABE = x = angle BEC. 

In triangle EBC, angle BEC = x, and angle EBC = 60 - x. 

If I can find x from somewhere else. 

Let me think about the sum of angles around point E. 

At point E, there are angles: angle AEB (z), angle BEC (x), and possibly others. 

If I assume that these are supplementary, like z + x = 180°, then from triangle ABE, x + y + z = 180. Substituting z = 180 - x, we get x + y + 180 - x = 180 → y = 0°, which is impossible. 

So this is not the case. 

Alternatively, if z + x = some other value. 

Without more info, it's impossible to proceed. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll take a gamble. Since angle BCE is 120°, and the sum of angles in triangle EBC is 180°, and the other two angles add to 60°. If one of these is 47° (angle 2), the other is 13°; if one is 26° (angle 3), the other is 34°; if one is 58° (angle 6), the other is 2°. None of these are options. 

But the answer choices are 43, 47, 58, 73. 

Wait, 43 is 180 - 137, but 137 is not a given angle. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is 180 - (47 + 26) = 107, which isn't an option. 

Wait, but in the sum of angles in triangle ABE, if two angles are known, the third can be found. 

If I assume that angle ABE = x = angle BEC = 47° (angle 2), then angle EBC = 60 - 47 = 13°. 

In triangle ABC, angle ABC = 60°, which is angle ABE + angle EBC = 47 + 13 = 60°, which works. 

Now, in triangle ABE, angles are x=47°, y, z. So 47 + y + z = 180 → y + z = 133°. 

Also, angle AEC = y (alternate interior angles). In triangle AEC, 2y + w = 180°. 

If angle ACE = w, and it's part of angle BCA in triangle ABC. 

Let me assume angle BCA = w. Then, in triangle ABC, angle BAC + w = 120°. 

If I can find w. 

But how? 

If I assume that angle ACE is part of angle BCA, and if there's a relation between w and other angles. 

Alternatively, if angle ACE is 26° (angle 3), then w = 26°, so 2y + 26 = 180 → y = 77°. Then, in triangle ABE, y + z = 133 → z = 133 - 77 = 56°. 

But what is z? z is angle AEB. 

At point E, angles include angle AEB (56°), angle BEC (47°), and possibly others. 

If these are supplementary, like 56 + 47 = 103°, which doesn't help. 

But if angle AEC = y = 77°, and angle AEC is part of triangle AEC, which has angles 77°, 26°, and 77° (wait, no, 2y + w = 180 → 2*77 + 26 = 180? 154 + 26 = 180 → yes. So angle ACE = 26°. 

So, in triangle ABC, angle BCA = 26°, and angle BAC = 120 - 26 = 94°. 

Now, in triangle ABE, angle BAE = y = 77°, angle ABE = 47°, angle AEB = 56°. 

Now, angle BAE = 77° is part of angle BAC = 94°, so the remaining part is 94 - 77 = 17°, which is angle EAC. 

But I don't know if that helps. 

Now, the question is asking for angle 5. If angle 5 is one of the angles in this scenario, it could be 56°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is 180 - (47 + 26) = 107°, which is not an option. 

This is not helping. 

Given that I'm stuck, and the answer choices include 43, which is 180 - 137, and 137 is 47 + 47 + 43, but this is just guessing. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is the remaining angle in triangle ABE, which is 180 - 47 - 47 = 86°, not an option. 

Wait, but if angle ABE = 47° (angle 2), and angle AEC = 47° (angle 2), then in triangle AEC, 2*47 + w = 180 → w = 86°. So angle ACE = 86°, which is part of angle BCA in triangle ABC. 

Then, angle BCA = 86°, so angle BAC = 120 - 86 = 34°. 

In triangle ABE, angle BAE = y, which is equal to angle AEC = 47°. So y = 47°. 

Then, in triangle ABE, x = 47°, y = 47°, so z = 180 - 47 - 47 = 86°. 

So angle AEB = 86°. 

Now, angle AEB is 86°, which could be angle 5. But 86 isn't an option. 

Alternatively, if angle 5 is 34°, which is not an option. 

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll choose the most likely option based on standard problems. In many cases, when you have parallel lines and transversals, the missing angle could be 43°, which is 180 - 137, or 180 - (58 + 47 + 26) = 49, close to 43. 

But since 43 is an option, I'll go with A:43.
