MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and visualize the diagram. 

We have a circle O with points A, B, C, D on it. Chords AC and BD intersect at point E. The arcs AB, BC, and CD are equal. Also, angle BEC is given as 110 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle BDC.

Starting with the setup: Since arcs AB, BC, and CD are equal, each arc must be one-third of the circumference. Wait, but a full circle is 360 degrees, so each arc would be 360/3 = 120 degrees? Wait, hold on. Wait, there are three arcs mentioned: AB, BC, CD. But where is the fourth arc? Maybe DA? Because the circle has four points, so maybe the arcs AB, BC, CD, DA. However, the problem says arc AB equals arc BC equals arc CD, but doesn't mention arc DA. So perhaps arc DA is different? Or maybe the total circumference is divided into three equal parts? That seems odd because usually, four points divide the circle into four arcs. Hmm, maybe there's something missing here. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that arcs AB, BC, and CD are equal. So maybe the fourth arc DA is also equal? But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the arcs AB, BC, CD are consecutive, making three equal arcs, implying that the fourth arc DA is another arc. But since the circle is 360 degrees, three equal arcs would sum to 3x, leaving the fourth arc as 360 - 3x. However, without more info, maybe we need to consider that the arcs AB, BC, CD are each equal, so each is 120 degrees? Wait, that would make the total of those three arcs 360 degrees, which would mean the fourth arc DA is zero, which isn't possible. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption. 

Alternatively, maybe the arcs AB, BC, CD are each equal, but they are not necessarily adjacent? No, arcs are typically considered between two points, so AB, BC, CD are consecutive arcs. So points A, B, C, D are placed around the circle such that moving from A to B to C to D, each arc is equal. Then the fourth arc DA would be the remaining part. Let me calculate that. Each arc AB, BC, CD is equal. Let’s denote the measure of each of these arcs as x. Then, the sum of arcs AB + BC + CD + DA = 360 degrees. Since AB=BC=CD=x, then 3x + DA = 360. But DA is not specified. However, maybe DA is also equal to x? That would make 4x = 360, so x=90. But then each arc would be 90 degrees. But wait, the problem mentions arcs AB, BC, CD being equal, but not DA. So unless DA is also equal, but that's not stated. This is confusing. 

Wait, maybe there are only three arcs mentioned, but the circle is divided into four arcs. Let me check the problem statement again. It says "arc AB = arc BC = arc CD". So three arcs are equal. So maybe the fourth arc DA is different. However, without knowing its measure, how can we proceed?

But let's look at the other given information. There are chords AC and BD intersecting at E. Also, angle BEC is 110 degrees. And we need to find angle BDC. 

Another thing: the problem gives several predicates like IsChordOf, PointLiesOnCircle, etc., which indicate that A, B, C, D lie on circle O, and lines AC, BD, BC, AB, CD are chords. Also, arcs AB, BC, CD are equal. 

So perhaps the arcs AB, BC, CD are each 120 degrees? Wait, if there are three arcs each of 120 degrees, then the total would be 360, leaving DA as zero. Which can't be. Therefore, that suggests that maybe there are four arcs, with AB, BC, CD, DA. But only three of them are equal. So maybe arc AB = arc BC = arc CD = x, and arc DA = y. Then 3x + y = 360. But without more info, how do we find x and y?

Alternatively, maybe the arcs AB, BC, CD are each 120 degrees, but that would require DA to be zero. Which is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the arcs AB, BC, CD are each 120 degrees, and DA is also 120 degrees? But then that would make four equal arcs, each 90 degrees. Wait, no, 360 divided by 4 is 90. So if arcs AB, BC, CD, DA are each 90 degrees. But the problem only states that AB, BC, CD are equal. So maybe DA is also equal? Perhaps the problem implies that all arcs are equal? Maybe there was a typo in the problem statement, but assuming that the arcs AB, BC, CD are equal, and DA is also equal, leading to four equal arcs of 90 degrees each. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arcs AB, BC, CD are each 120 degrees, and DA is 0. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the arcs AB, BC, CD are each 120 degrees, and DA is another arc. Let me try that. Suppose arc AB = arc BC = arc CD = 120 degrees. Then arc DA would be 360 - (120*3) = 0 degrees. Not possible. Hence, this can't be. Therefore, maybe the arcs AB, BC, CD are each 120 degrees, but there's another arc AD. Wait, but points A and D are connected via chord AD? Not sure. 

Alternatively, perhaps the arcs AB, BC, CD are each 120 degrees, and the arc DA is 0 degrees, which is not possible. Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption about the arcs is wrong. Maybe the arcs AB, BC, CD are each 120 degrees, but that would require that the points are arranged such that moving from A to B to C to D covers 360 degrees. Wait, but that would imply that the arc from D back to A is zero, which is not possible. Hence, there must be some mistake in my understanding. 

Let me re-examine the problem statement. The problem says "arc AB = arc BC = arc CD", but does not mention arc DA. So maybe arc AB, arc BC, arc CD are each equal, but arc DA is different. However, without knowing arc DA's measure, how can we proceed? 

But maybe we don't need to know arc DA's measure directly. Let me focus on the intersection point E of chords AC and BD. In circle geometry, when two chords intersect, there's a theorem that relates the products of the segments. Specifically, AE * EC = BE * ED. But maybe that's not immediately helpful here. However, there's also the property that the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting inside a circle is half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

Yes! The formula is: the measure of angle BEC is equal to (arc BC + arc AD)/2. Wait, let me recall. When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is equal to half the sum of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, angle BEC is formed by chords EB and EC. The intercepted arcs would be arc BC and arc AD. Wait, let me confirm. When two chords intersect at E, the angle at E intercepts arcs opposite to it. For example, angle BEC intercepts arcs BD and AC? Wait, maybe I should draw it mentally. 

Points A and C are endpoints of chord AC. Points B and D are endpoints of chord BD. They intersect at E. So angle BEC is formed by chords EB and EC. The intercepted arcs would be arc BC and arc AD. Because the angle at E is formed by the intersection of chords EB (from E to B) and EC (from E to C). So the intercepted arcs are arc BC (between B and C) and arc AD (between A and D). Therefore, according to the intersecting chords angle theorem, angle BEC = ½(arc BC + arc AD).

Given that angle BEC is 110 degrees, then:

110 = ½(arc BC + arc AD)

Multiply both sides by 2:

220 = arc BC + arc AD

Now, since arcs AB, BC, CD are equal, let's denote each of these arcs as x. So arc AB = arc BC = arc CD = x. Then, arc AD is the sum of arc AB + arc BC + arc CD? Wait, no. Arc AD goes from A to D. Depending on the arrangement of points, arc AD could be either the minor arc or major arc. But since the circle is divided into arcs AB, BC, CD, and DA, the total circumference is arc AB + arc BC + arc CD + arc DA = 360 degrees. 

Since arc AB = arc BC = arc CD = x, then:

arc AB + arc BC + arc CD = 3x

Therefore, arc DA = 360 - 3x

Substituting back into the equation from the angle:

arc BC + arc AD = x + (360 - 3x) = 360 - 2x = 220 degrees

Thus:

360 - 2x = 220 → 2x = 360 - 220 = 140 → x = 70 degrees

So each of arcs AB, BC, CD is 70 degrees. Therefore, arc DA = 360 - 3(70) = 360 - 210 = 150 degrees.

Now, we need to find angle BDC. Let's analyze angle BDC. Point D is connected to point B and point C. Angle BDC is the angle at point D between points B and C. 

To find angle BDC, we can use the inscribed angle theorem. An inscribed angle is equal to half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle BDC intercepts arc BC. Wait, no. Let me think. 

Point D is on the circumference, and angle BDC is formed by chords DB and DC. The intercepted arc is arc BC. Wait, yes. Because angle at D intercepts arc BC. Therefore, angle BDC = ½ arc BC. 

Since arc BC is x = 70 degrees, then angle BDC = ½ * 70 = 35 degrees. 

Wait, but let me verify this. Inscribed angle subtended by arc BC would indeed be half the measure of arc BC. So angle BDC is 70 / 2 = 35 degrees. Therefore, the answer would be 35°, which corresponds to choice A.

But let me double-check. Another way to approach this: Since arc BC is 70 degrees, then the central angle over arc BC is 70 degrees. The inscribed angle subtending arc BC would be half that, so 35 degrees. Yes, that seems correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in determining the value of x. Let me go back through the steps. 

From angle BEC = 110 degrees, which equals ½(arc BC + arc AD). We found arc BC is x, arc AD is 360 - 3x. Then:

x + (360 - 3x) = 220 → 360 - 2x = 220 → 2x = 140 → x = 70. Correct. 

Then arc BC is 70 degrees. So angle BDC intercepts arc BC, hence 70/2 = 35 degrees. Therefore, answer A.

But wait, let me check if angle BDC actually intercepts arc BC. Let me imagine the circle with points A, B, C, D in order. So starting at A, going to B, then C, then D, then back to A. Arc BC is between B and C, which is 70 degrees. Point D is located such that from D, looking at points B and C, the angle BDC would intercept arc BC. Wait, but depending on where D is, the intercepted arc might be the other arc BC (the major arc). Wait, but since angle BDC is formed by points B, D, C, the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite to angle BDC, which is arc BC that does not contain D. 

Since D is on the circle, and the points are ordered A, B, C, D around the circle, then the arc BC that does not contain D would be the minor arc BC (since D is after C). Therefore, angle BDC intercepts arc BC, which is 70 degrees, so the measure is 35 degrees. Thus, the answer is 35°, which is option A.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. What if angle BDC intercepts arc BAD instead? No, because angle at D, so the intercepted arc is between B and C that doesn't pass through D. Given the arrangement of points, arc BC is the one not containing D. Hence, angle BDC = ½ arc BC = 35°. 

So the answer should be A.
