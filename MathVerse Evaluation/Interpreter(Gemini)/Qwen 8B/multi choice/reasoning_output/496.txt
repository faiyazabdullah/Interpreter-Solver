QUESTION:
There is a quadratic function, which goes through (0,0), (20,0) and opens upward. Determine whether the graph represents a one-to-one function.

CHOICES:
A.This is a one-to-one function
B.This is not a one-to-one function

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about determining if a quadratic function that passes through (0,0) and (20,0) and opens upward is one-to-one. 

First, I need to recall what a one-to-one function is. A function is one-to-one if every y-value corresponds to exactly one x-value. In other words, no two different inputs give the same output. For functions, especially those represented graphically, this means the graph should pass the horizontal line test—no horizontal line intersects the graph more than once.

Now, the given function is quadratic. Quadratic functions have graphs that are parabolas. The standard form of a quadratic function is f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Since it opens upward, the coefficient 'a' must be positive. Also, it passes through (0,0) and (20,0). Let me think about the general shape of such a parabola.

Since the parabola passes through (0,0), plugging x=0 into the equation gives f(0) = a*0 + b*0 + c = c = 0. So c is 0. Then the equation simplifies to f(x) = ax² + bx. It also passes through (20,0), so substituting x=20, we get 0 = a*(20)^2 + b*20. That simplifies to 400a + 20b = 0. Dividing both sides by 20 gives 20a + b = 0, so b = -20a.

So the function becomes f(x) = ax² - 20a x. We can factor out a, getting f(x) = a(x² - 20x). To make this easier, maybe complete the square? Let me try that. 

x² - 20x can be written as (x - 10)^2 - 100. So the function becomes f(x) = a[(x - 10)^2 - 100] = a(x - 10)^2 - 100a. This shows the vertex of the parabola is at (10, -100a). Since the parabola opens upwards, a > 0, so the vertex is the minimum point.

Now, the key thing here is that a quadratic function is not one-to-one over its entire domain because it's symmetric about its vertical axis. For example, if you take any y-value above the vertex, there are two x-values that map to it: one on either side of the vertex. Therefore, the horizontal line test fails, meaning it's not one-to-one.

But wait, could there be a case where it is one-to-one? Well, if we restrict the domain. But the question doesn't mention restricting the domain. It just asks about the graph of the quadratic function as a whole. Since the parabola is symmetric, it's definitely not one-to-one over the entire real line. So the answer should be B: Not a one-to-one function.

Let me check again. Another way to see: suppose there are two distinct x-values, say x1 and x2, such that f(x1) = f(x2). For a quadratic, this would mean they are symmetric around the vertex. Since the vertex is at x=10, if x1 is 10 + h, then x2 would be 10 - h. Thus, unless h=0, these are two different points. Hence, the function isn't injective (one-to-one). 

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
