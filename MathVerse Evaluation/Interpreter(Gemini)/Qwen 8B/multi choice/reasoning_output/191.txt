MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C on a circle with center O. There's a tangent line at point A that meets the extended line OC at point P. We know angle B is 30 degrees, and OP is 3 units long. We need to find the length of AP.

First, I should recall some geometry concepts. Since OA is a radius and the tangent at A is perpendicular to OA, so OA is perpendicular to the tangent line AP. That means triangle OAP is a right triangle with the right angle at A. Wait, but OA is a radius, and OP is the hypotenuse? Or maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, the tangent line at A is perpendicular to OA. So line AP is tangent at A, so OA is perpendicular to AP. Therefore, triangle OAP has a right angle at A. So OA is one leg, AP is another leg, and OP is the hypotenuse. But wait, OA is a radius, so if we can find OA, then maybe we can use Pythagoras here. But we don't know OA yet.

But there's more info. Points A, B, C are on the circle, so OA, OB, OC are radii. Also, angle B is 30 degrees. Wait, angle B refers to angle ABC? Or angle at point B? Wait, the problem says angle B = 30.0. In the predicates, they mention Angle(A,B,C) which would be angle at point B. So angle ABC is 30 degrees. 

Also, since points A, B, C are on the circle centered at O, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle. Maybe we can relate angles in the circle. For example, the central angle over arc AC would be twice the inscribed angle. Wait, but angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Hmm. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, since OA, OB, OC are radii, triangle OAB is isosceles because OA=OB. And in the predicates, it's stated that Isosceles(Triangle(O,A,B)) and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(O,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(O,B,A))). So angles at A and B in triangle OAB are equal. Wait, but angle at A and angle at B?

Wait, Triangle(O,A,B) is isosceles with OA=OB. So sides OA and OB are equal, making angles opposite them equal. Wait, in triangle OAB, OA and OB are equal, so angles at B and A are equal? Wait, no. Wait, OA and OB are the two legs, so vertex at O. So triangle OAB has vertices O, A, B. Sides OA and OB are equal. Therefore, the base is AB, and the two equal sides are OA and OB. So the base angles at A and B are equal. Wait, but the predicates say Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(O,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(O,B,A))). Wait, Angle(O,A,B) is angle at point A, between O-A-B. Similarly, Angle(O,B,A) is angle at point B, between O-B-A. Wait, but those are the base angles of the isosceles triangle OAB, so they should be equal. So yes, that makes sense.

Now, angle ABC is 30 degrees. How does that relate to other angles? Let me see. Point C is also on the circle. Also, point C lies on line OP extended. Because in the predicates, PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(O,P)). So point C is somewhere along the line extending from O through P. Wait, but line OP starts at O and goes through P. But point C is on that line. Wait, but earlier, point C is on the circle. So OC is a radius, but since C is on line OP, then OC is part of line OP. Therefore, point C is on line OP, which implies that OC is aligned with OP. So line OC passes through point P. So OP is longer than OC, or maybe not. Wait, since P is the intersection of the tangent at A with the extension of OC. So if we extend OC beyond C to meet the tangent line at P. So P is outside the circle, since it's on the tangent line. Therefore, OP is longer than OC. So OC is a radius, and OP is 3.0 units. Wait, the problem states that LengthOf(Line(O,C)) equals 3.0? Wait, looking back at the predicates: Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,C)),3.0). Yes, so OC is 3.0. So OC is a radius of the circle, so OA and OB are also 3.0 units. Because all radii are equal.

So OA = OB = OC = 3.0 units. Then, OP is given as 3.0? Wait no, the problem says OP = 3.0. Wait, the question says "OP = 3.0". Wait, the user wrote: "angle B = 30.0, OP = 3.0, then the length of AP is ()" So OP is 3.0. But OC is also 3.0. So point C is on line OP such that OC = 3.0, so C is a point on the circle, hence OC is radius. Therefore, since line OP extends through C to P, then OP = OC + CP. But since P is outside the circle, CP is positive. So OP = OC + CP => CP = OP - OC = 3.0 - 3.0 = 0? That can't be. Wait, perhaps my understanding is wrong.

Wait, the line OC is extended beyond C to point P. So OC is from O to C, and then extended past C to P. Therefore, OP is longer than OC. So OP = OC + CP. But according to the problem, OP = 3.0. However, OC is 3.0 as per the predicate. So that would imply CP = OP - OC = 3.0 - 3.0 = 0. Which suggests that point C coincides with P. But that can't be, because point C is on the circle, and P is on the tangent line. Unless there's something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem states: "the tangent line of circle O passing through point A intersects the extended line of OC at point P." So the tangent line at A meets the extended line OC at P. So line OC is extended beyond C to meet the tangent line at P. Therefore, point P is outside the circle, beyond C. Therefore, OP is longer than OC. But according to the given data, OP is 3.0. However, the predicate says LengthOf(Line(O,C)) equals 3.0. So OC is 3.0. Therefore, OP is 3.0, which would mean that P is located at the same distance from O as C. But since P is on the extension of OC beyond C, then OP would be OC + CP. So if OP = 3.0 and OC = 3.0, then CP would be zero, implying P=C. But that contradicts the fact that P is on the tangent line. Therefore, there's a contradiction here unless my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, maybe the line OC is extended in the other direction? Like from O through C to P. Wait, if we extend OC beyond O to P, then P would be on the opposite side of O from C. But then the tangent line at A would intersect this extended line. But how does that fit with the rest?

Alternatively, perhaps the line OC is extended beyond O to P? Wait, but then P would be on the line OC extended beyond O. Let me think. If P is on the tangent line at A, then depending on where the tangent line is, the intersection could be in different places. Let me try to visualize.

Let me sketch mentally: circle O, points A, B, C on circumference. Tangent at A. This tangent line meets the extended line of OC at point P. So line OC starts at O, goes through C, and then continues to P. So P is beyond C away from O. Therefore, OP = OC + CP. Given that OC is 3.0 (radius), and OP is given as 3.0. So that would require CP = 0, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the line OC is extended in the other direction? Suppose line OC is extended beyond O to P. Then OP would be the length from O to P, but in that case, P would be on the line OC extended beyond O. Then, OP would be less than OC if P is between O and C. Wait, but that depends on the position. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that OP = 3.0. Let me recheck the problem statement.

Original problem: "angle B = 30.0, OP = 3.0, then the length of AP is ()".

Ah! Wait, the problem says OP = 3.0. But in the predicates, LengthOf(Line(O,C)) equals 3.0. So OC is 3.0. Therefore, OP is also 3.0. So OP = OC. But if P is on the extended line of OC, then either P is between O and C, or beyond C. Let's consider both cases.

Case 1: P is between O and C. Then OP < OC. But OP is given as 3.0, OC is 3.0. So that would imply P coincides with C, which isn't possible since P is on the tangent line. Case 2: P is beyond C. Then OP = OC + CP. So if OP = 3.0 and OC = 3.0, then CP = 0. Again, P would coincide with C. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that OP is 3.0, but OC is not necessarily 3.0? Wait, let me check the predicates again. The user provided several predicates. One of them is: Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,C)),3.0). So that is given. So OC is 3.0. Then, OP is given as 3.0. So OP = OC. How is this possible?

Wait, maybe the line OC is not extended beyond C, but in the other direction. Suppose line OC is extended beyond O to P. Then OP would be the length from O to P, but since P is on the line OC extended beyond O, then OP would be a segment starting at O going in the opposite direction of C. In this case, OP would be a length, but the total length from O to P is 3.0. However, in this scenario, the tangent line at A intersects the line OC extended beyond O at point P. Let's explore this possibility.

In this case, P is on the line OC extended beyond O. So the line OP is in the opposite direction of C. Now, since OA is a radius, and the tangent at A is perpendicular to OA. So if we draw tangent at A, it will form a right angle with OA. Now, if P is on line OC extended beyond O, then the line AP is the tangent line. So triangle OAP is a right triangle with right angle at A. So OA is perpendicular to AP.

Given that, in triangle OAP, OA is one leg, AP is another leg, and OP is the hypotenuse. Wait, no. Wait, OA is perpendicular to AP, so triangle OAP is right-angled at A. Therefore, OA^2 + AP^2 = OP^2. Since OA is a radius, which is 3.0. So OA = 3.0. OP is given as 3.0. So substituting:

OA² + AP² = OP² → 3² + AP² = 3² → AP² = 0 → AP = 0. That can't be. So this leads to a contradiction. Therefore, this case is invalid.

Hmm, this suggests that there's a problem with my assumptions. Let me go back. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting which segments are which. Let me re-examine the problem carefully.

Problem statement: points A, B, and C are on circle O. The tangent line of circle O passing through A intersects the extended line of OC at point P. So, tangent at A meets the extended line of OC at P. So line OC is extended beyond C to P. Thus, P is beyond C on line OC. Therefore, OP = OC + CP. But given that OP = 3.0, and OC = 3.0, then CP = 0. Which would imply P is at C. But that's not possible since P is on the tangent line at A. So unless C is the point where the tangent line meets OC, but that would require that the tangent line at A passes through C, which may not be the case.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the problem setup. Let me check again the given predicates.

Looking back, the user provided several predicates. Let me list them again:

- Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(O), Point(P)
- Circle(O)
- PointLiesOnCircle(A,O), PointLiesOnCircle(B,O), PointLiesOnCircle(C,O)
- Tangent(Line(A,P), Circle(O))
- Line(O,A), Line(O,B), Line(O,C), Line(O,P)
- Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(A,P)
- IsRadiusOf(Line(O,A), Circle(O)), IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B), Circle(O))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,A)), LengthOf(Line(O,B)))
- Angle(A,B,C), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)),30.0)
- LengthOf(Line(O,C)), Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,C)),3.0)
- Perpendicular(Line(O,A), Line(A,P)), RightAngle(Angle(O,A,P))
- PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(O,P))
- Angle(O,A,B), Angle(O,B,A)
- Isosceles(Triangle(O,A,B))
- Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(O,A,B)), MeasureOf(Angle(O,B,A)))
- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(A,P))
- PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(O)), PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(O))
- PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(B,C))
- Triangle(O,A,P), Right(Triangle(O,A,P))

Wait, the last predicate says Right(Triangle(O,A,P)), which confirms that triangle OAP is right-angled. And since OA is perpendicular to AP, as per the Perpendicular(Line(O,A), Line(A,P)) predicate.

So, triangle OAP is right-angled at A. Therefore, OA is one leg, AP is another leg, and OP is the hypotenuse. From the above, OA is a radius, so OA = 3.0. OP is given as 3.0. So applying Pythagoras:

OA² + AP² = OP²  
=> 3² + AP² = 3²  
=> AP² = 0  
=> AP = 0. 

This is impossible. So there must be an error in my interpretation. Where is the mistake?

Wait, maybe OP is not the hypotenuse. Wait, triangle OAP is right-angled at A. So OA and AP are the legs, and OP is the hypotenuse. But if OA is 3, and OP is 3, then AP must be zero. This suggests inconsistency in the given data. But the problem is presented as solvable, so likely I'm missing something.

Let me re-examine the problem statement again. It says "the tangent line of circle O passing through point A intersects the extended line of OC at point P". So the tangent line at A is LP, and it meets the extended line of OC at P. So, the line OC is extended beyond C to meet the tangent line at P. Therefore, P is outside the circle, beyond C on line OC. So OP = OC + CP. But the problem gives us that OP = 3.0, and OC = 3.0. So CP = OP - OC = 3.0 - 3.0 = 0. So P coincides with C. But then, if P is C, then the tangent line at A passes through C. But C is on the circle, so if the tangent at A passes through C, then AC would be a tangent line. But AC is a chord of the circle, since both A and C are on the circle. A tangent cannot pass through another point on the circle except the point of tangency. Hence, this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumption.

Wait, perhaps the line OC is extended in the other direction, i.e., beyond O to P. So P is on the line OC extended beyond O. Then, OP is the length from O to P, which would be in the opposite direction of C. In this case, OP = 3.0. Then, since OC is 3.0, then OP = 3.0 would mean that P is located at a distance of 3.0 from O in the opposite direction of C. So P is diametrically opposite to C? No, because OC is a radius, so if OP is also 3.0, then P would be on the circle as well. But P is supposed to be on the tangent line at A. So if P is on the circle, then the tangent line at A passes through P, which is on the circle. But that would make AP a secant, not a tangent. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that there's a fundamental issue with the given data. However, since the problem is given, I must have misunderstood something. Let me try to look for alternative approaches.

Perhaps the length OP is not directly given as 3.0, but the LengthOf(Line(O,C)) is 3.0. Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,C)),3.0). So OC = 3.0. And the problem says OP = 3.0. So OP is 3.0. So OP is the same as OC. But how?

Wait, maybe the line OC is extended beyond O to P, so that OP = 3.0. Then, since OC is 3.0, then OP = 3.0 would mean that P is located at O plus the vector from O to C, but in the opposite direction. Wait, no. If line OC is extended beyond O, then P is on the line OC extended beyond O. So OP is measured from O to P, which would be in the direction opposite to C. So if OC is 3.0, then OP is also 3.0, meaning P is 3.0 units from O in the direction opposite to C. So, for example, if O is the origin, C is at (3, 0), then P would be at (-3, 0). But then the tangent line at A passes through P. Let me assume that.

Assume O is the origin, C is at (3, 0), so OC is along x-axis from O(0,0) to C(3,0). Extending OC beyond O would take us to negative x-direction. So P is at (-3, 0). Now, the tangent line at A passes through P(-3, 0). Let's suppose point A is somewhere on the circle. Let me choose coordinates to simplify.

Let me assign coordinates. Let’s set up coordinate system with O at (0,0). Let’s assume that point A is at (0,3), so that OA is vertical. Then, the tangent at A would be horizontal line y=3. Wait, but if OA is vertical, then the tangent at A is horizontal. This line y=3 would intersect the extended line OC. What is line OC? OC is from O(0,0) to C(3,0), so it's the x-axis. Extended beyond O would be the x-axis extended left. The tangent line at A is y=3, which doesn't intersect the x-axis. Hence, no intersection. Contradiction. So this coordinate choice is invalid.

Alternative: Let me choose point A such that the tangent at A passes through P on the extended line OC. Let me pick point A at (3,0), which is same as point C. But then the tangent at A would be vertical line x=3, which intersects the extended line OC (x-axis) at (3,0), which is point A itself. Not helpful.

Another idea: Let me use the property of power of a point. The power of point P with respect to circle O is equal to PA² (since PA is tangent to the circle at A). Power of P is also equal to PO² - r², where r is the radius. Here, r = OC = 3.0. So PA² = PO² - r². Given that PO is 3.0, then PA² = 3² - 3² = 0 → PA = 0. Again, same contradiction. So this suggests that with the given data, PA must be zero, which is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction in the problem's given data.

But since the problem is presented as having an answer, I must have misinterpreted the given data. Let me check again the predicates. Oh! Wait, the problem says "the tangent line of circle O passing through point A intersects the extended line of OC at point P". So maybe the line OC is extended in the direction from O through C to P, but OP is not the entire length from O to P, but rather the length from O to P is given as 3.0. Wait, but if OC is 3.0, and P is on the extended line OC beyond C, then OP = OC + CP. If OP = 3.0, then CP = OP - OC = 3.0 - 3.0 = 0. So P coincides with C. But then the tangent line at A passes through C. As before, this implies that AC is tangent to the circle at A, but since C is on the circle, AC would be a chord, not a tangent. Hence, contradiction.

Wait, but what if the tangent line at A passes through C? Then AC is tangent at A, so AC is perpendicular to OA. So OA ⊥ AC. But since C is on the circle, OA is a radius, and AC is tangent at A. Hence, OA is perpendicular to AC. So triangle OAC is right-angled at A. So OA is perpendicular to AC. So OA^2 + AC^2 = OC^2. Since OA = OC = 3.0, then 3^2 + AC^2 = 3^2 → AC = 0. So point C coincides with A. But that's not possible as C is a distinct point.

This seems like a dead end. Let me try to look for another way. Perhaps the given angle B = 30 degrees is crucial here. Let me think about triangle ABC. Since points A, B, C are on the circle, and angle at B is 30 degrees. Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle ABC intercepts arc AC. So measure of angle ABC = ½ measure of arc AC. Hence, arc AC measures 60 degrees. Therefore, the central angle for arc AC is 60 degrees, which is angle AOC. So angle AOC = 60 degrees. 

Since OA and OC are radii, triangle AOC is isosceles with OA = OC = 3.0. So triangle AOC has two sides of length 3.0 and included angle of 60 degrees. Therefore, it's an equilateral triangle. Hence, AC = OA = OC = 3.0. So AC = 3.0. 

Now, considering the tangent at A. Since OA is perpendicular to AP, and AP is tangent. So OA ⊥ AP. Also, from earlier, AC = 3.0, and OA = 3.0. So triangle OAC is equilateral. Hence, angle OAC is 60 degrees. 

But how does this relate to point P? Let me think. If P is on the extended line of OC, then OP is a line from O through C to P. Let me denote that line as OC extended beyond C to P. So P is colinear with O and C, beyond C. 

We have to relate this with the tangent at A. Since AP is tangent at A, and OA is perpendicular to AP. So AP is perpendicular to OA. Let me try to use coordinates again, assuming O is at origin, and setting up coordinates to simplify.

Let me place point O at (0,0). Let me set point A at (3, 0), so OA is along x-axis. Since angle AOC is 60 degrees, as determined earlier, and OC is another radius. So point C is at an angle of 60 degrees from OA. So if OA is along x-axis, then OC makes 60 degrees with OA. So coordinates of C would be (3 cos θ, 3 sin θ), where θ = 60 degrees. So cos 60° = 0.5, sin 60° = √3/2. So C is at (3*(0.5), 3*(√3/2)) = (1.5, (3√3)/2).

Now, the line OC goes from O(0,0) to C(1.5, (3√3)/2). Extend this line beyond C to point P. Let me parametrize this line. Parametric equations: x = t*1.5, y = t*(3√3)/2, where t=1 corresponds to point C, and t > 1 goes beyond C to P.

Now, the tangent at A(3,0) is perpendicular to OA, which is along x-axis. Since OA is horizontal, the tangent at A is vertical line x = 3. So the tangent line at A is x = 3. This line intersects the extended line OC at point P. 

Find intersection of x=3 and line OC. The line OC has parametric equations x = 1.5t, y = (3√3/2)t. Setting x=3: 1.5t = 3 → t = 2. So at t=2, the point P is at x=3, y=(3√3/2)*2 = 3√3. So coordinates of P are (3, 3√3). 

Now, calculate OP. Since O is at (0,0), P is at (3, 3√3). So OP length is sqrt((3)^2 + (3√3)^2) = sqrt(9 + 27) = sqrt(36) = 6. So OP = 6. But the problem states that OP = 3.0. This contradicts the given data. Hence, there's inconsistency. 

But in this scenario, the length AP is the distance from A(3,0) to P(3, 3√3), which is vertical distance: 3√3 - 0 = 3√3. So AP = 3√3. But according to the problem, OP is supposed to be 3.0, but in this calculation, it's 6. So this suggests that either the problem has inconsistent data or my assumption about angle B being 30 degrees leading to arc AC being 60 degrees is incorrect. 

Wait, let me re-examine the angle. Earlier, I assumed that angle ABC = 30 degrees, which is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC. But is that correct? 

Inscribed angle ABC intercepts arc AC. Wait, point B is on the circle, so angle ABC is formed by points A, B, C. The inscribed angle at B would intercept arc AC. So yes, measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc AC. Hence, arc AC is 60 degrees. Hence, central angle AOC is 60 degrees. 

But in this coordinate system, with O at (0,0), A at (3,0), and C at (1.5, (3√3)/2), the central angle AOC is indeed 60 degrees. Hence, the calculation seems correct. But in this case, OP is 6.0, while the problem says OP = 3.0. So there's a discrepancy. 

However, the problem says OP = 3.0. So perhaps in this scenario, OP is 6.0, but the problem says it's 3.0. To adjust for this, perhaps scale down the diagram. Let's say the radius is r instead of 3.0. Then, in our previous calculation, OP = 2r. So if OP is given as 3.0, then 2r = 3.0 → r = 1.5. Hence, OA = 1.5, OC = 1.5, and OP = 3.0. Let's recalculate AP in this scaled-down scenario.

With r = 1.5, point A is at (1.5, 0). Point C is at (1.5 * cos(60°), 1.5 * sin(60°)) = (1.5 * 0.5, 1.5 * (√3/2)) = (0.75, (1.5√3)/2). Line OC is from O(0,0) to C(0.75, (1.5√3)/2). Extend this line beyond C to P. The tangent at A is vertical line x = 1.5. Find intersection with line OC. Parametric equations for line OC: x = 0.75t, y = (1.5√3/2)t. Set x = 1.5: 0.75t = 1.5 → t = 2. So at t=2, y = (1.5√3/2)*2 = 1.5√3. Hence, P is at (1.5, 1.5√3). 

Then, OP is the distance from (0,0) to (1.5, 1.5√3): sqrt(1.5² + (1.5√3)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 6.75) = sqrt(9) = 3.0, which matches the given OP = 3.0. Great! Now, AP is the distance from A(1.5, 0) to P(1.5, 1.5√3), which is vertical distance: 1.5√3 - 0 = 1.5√3. 

Thus, AP = 1.5√3, which is equivalent to (3/2)√3. Looking at the answer choices, this corresponds to option D: 3/2√3. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D.
