MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a circle O with points A, B, M, N on it. Point M is the midpoint of arc AB, and connecting MO and extending it to meet the circle again at N. Then we connect BN, and we need to find the measure of angle N, given that angle AOB is 140 degrees.

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since M is the midpoint of arc AB, that means arc AM equals arc MB. Also, since OA and OB are radii, triangle AOB is isosceles with OA=OB. The given angle AOB is 140 degrees, so maybe I can find the arcs corresponding to that angle.

Wait, the central angle AOB corresponds to the arc AB. Since the entire circumference is 360 degrees, but angle AOB is 140 degrees, so arc AB measures 140 degrees. But since M is the midpoint of arc AB, each of arcs AM and MB would be half of 140, which is 70 degrees each. So arc AM = arc MB = 70 degrees.

Now, since M is the midpoint of arc AB, and we're extending OM to meet the circle again at N. That means N is diametrically opposite to M? Wait, no. Because OM is extended beyond M to N. Wait, but O is the center. So OM is a radius, and extending it past M to another point N on the circle. Therefore, ON would be a straight line passing through O and M, making MN a diameter? Wait, because if you go from O through M to N, then ON is twice OM, but since O is the center, and M is on the circle, then OM is a radius. Extending it to N would make ON a radius in the opposite direction? No, wait. If M is on the circle, then OM is a radius. Extending OM beyond M would take us outside the circle. Wait, but the problem says "extend it to intersect circle O at point N". So starting at O, going through M, and then intersecting the circle again at N. Wait, but O is the center. So if you start at O, go towards M (which is on the circle), then extending beyond M would go outside the circle. But the problem states that extending MO intersects the circle at N. Wait, that doesn't make sense unless N is the other intersection point. Wait, perhaps there's confusion here. Let me think again.

Wait, the line MO connects points M and O. But O is the center. So if we extend MO beyond O, then it would pass through O and continue to another point. Wait, but the problem says "extend it to intersect circle O at point N". So starting at M, going through O, and then extending to N on the circle. Wait, but O is inside the circle. So if you extend MO beyond O, then N would be on the opposite side of O from M. So N is such that O lies between M and N, and ON is a radius in the opposite direction of OM. Therefore, MN would be a diameter because MO + ON = MN, where MO and ON are both radii. Therefore, MN is a diameter. Wait, but the problem also mentions that IsDiameterOf(Line(M,N),Circle(O)). So yes, MN is a diameter. Therefore, N is directly opposite M across the center O.

So, since M is the midpoint of arc AB, and MN is a diameter, then N is located such that it's diametrically opposite to M. Now, we need to consider angle N, which I assume refers to angle BNO or angle BNM? Wait, the problem says "connect BN, if angle AOB = 140.0, then the degree of angle N is ()". Maybe angle N refers to angle BNO or angle at point N, like angle BNM?

Alternatively, maybe angle N refers to angle ANB or something else. Wait, the problem statement mentions "angle N", which could be ambiguous. However, since they mention connecting BN, perhaps angle N refers to angle at point N formed by points B, N, and another point. Wait, but the problem just says "angle N". Maybe it's angle at N between points B and another point. Let me check the original problem again.

Original problem: "Connect MO and extend it to intersect circle O at point N, connect BN, if angle AOB = 140.0, then the degree of angle N is ()".

So after connecting BN, angle N is likely referring to angle BNO, or angle at N involving points B and another. Alternatively, maybe angle NB... something. Wait, since N is connected to B, and O is the center. Maybe angle N is angle BNM or angle BNO. Alternatively, perhaps angle at N between points B and M? Or maybe angle at N between points B and O?

But the problem statement isn't entirely clear, but given standard conventions, perhaps angle N refers to angle BNO. Let me proceed with that assumption.

Alternatively, since angle N could refer to angle ANB, but without more context, it's tricky. However, given the options, let's try to work through possibilities.

Let me first note down what we know:

- Arc AB = 140 degrees (since central angle AOB is 140).
- Arc AM = arc MB = 70 degrees each.
- MN is a diameter, so arc MN is 180 degrees.
- Since M is midpoint of arc AB, and MN is a diameter, then position of N depends on the location of M relative to the circle.

Since M is the midpoint of arc AB, which is 140 degrees. Let me imagine the circle with center O. Points A and B separated by 140 degrees. M is halfway between them along the arc AB. Then, drawing line OM, which is a radius, and extending it through O to N, which is on the opposite side of the circle. So N is diametrically opposite to M.

Therefore, the arc from M to N would be half the circle, i.e., 180 degrees. But how does this relate to the rest?

Now, considering point N. We need to connect BN. So line segment BN connects B to N. The question is about angle N, which I'll assume refers to angle BNO or angle at N between points B and O. Alternatively, maybe angle at N between points B and M? Let me think.

Another approach: Since MN is a diameter, then angle at N subtended by BM or something else. Let's consider triangle BNO.

Wait, O is the center, N is on the circle, so ON is a radius. Also, OB is a radius. So triangle BNO has two sides as radii: OB and ON. Therefore, triangle BNO is isosceles with OB = ON. Thus, angle at O is angle BON. What is angle BON?

To find angle BON, we need to determine the arc between B and N. Let's compute that arc.

We know that arc AB is 140 degrees. Since M is the midpoint of arc AB, arc AM = arc MB = 70 degrees each.

Now, N is diametrically opposite to M. So moving from M through O to N, which is a straight line. Therefore, the arc from M to N would be half the circle, but depending on which arc. Since the total circle is 360 degrees, and arc AB is 140 degrees, the remaining arcs are 360 - 140 = 220 degrees. But since M is the midpoint of arc AB, which is 140 degrees, then the arc from A to B is 140 degrees. The rest of the circle is 220 degrees. Depending on whether arc AB is major or minor. Wait, since angle AOB is 140 degrees, which is less than 180, so arc AB is minor arc AB. Therefore, the major arc AB would be 360 - 140 = 220 degrees. But since M is the midpoint of arc AB, it refers to the minor arc AB, right? Wait, usually, when someone refers to arc AB without qualification, it's the minor arc unless specified otherwise. But since M is the midpoint of arc AB, and given that angle AOB is 140 degrees, which is the central angle for arc AB. So arc AB is 140 degrees, and M divides it into two equal parts of 70 degrees each.

Now, since N is diametrically opposite to M, so the arc from M to N would be half the circle. But which direction? Let me visualize the circle. Suppose we have points A and B with arc AB being 140 degrees. M is the midpoint of arc AB, so it's 70 degrees from A and B. Then, extending OM to N, so N is on the opposite side of the circle from M. So the arc from M to N would go through the opposite side. To find the arc from B to N, let's see:

Starting from point B, moving along the circumference to N. The arc from B to N would depend on the position of N relative to B.

Let me calculate the arc from B to N. Let's break it down:

Arc from B to M is 70 degrees (since arc BM is part of arc AB). Then, arc from M to N is 180 degrees (as MN is a diameter). Wait, but that would mean the arc from B to N via M is 70 + 180 = 250 degrees. However, there might be a shorter arc. Alternatively, the arc from B to N could go the other way around the circle. Let's think carefully.

Alternatively, since N is diametrically opposite M, then the arc from B to N can be found by considering the position of N relative to B.

Let me try to compute the measure of arc BN. Let me consider the positions:

Start with the circle centered at O. Points A and B are such that arc AB is 140 degrees. M is the midpoint of arc AB, so 70 degrees from A and B. Then, N is diametrically opposite to M. So, if we move from M through O to N, then N is located such that the arc from M to N is 180 degrees. 

To find arc BN, we can look at the total circle. Starting from B, going counterclockwise to N. Let's imagine the circle divided into arcs:

- From B to M: 70 degrees (since arc BM is 70 degrees)
- From M to N: 180 degrees (since MN is a diameter)
Total arc from B to N via M: 70 + 180 = 250 degrees. However, since the circle is 360 degrees, the smaller arc from B to N would be 360 - 250 = 110 degrees. Wait, but that might not be correct. Wait, actually, the arc length can vary depending on direction. But since N is diametrically opposite to M, and M is 70 degrees away from B along arc AB, then the arc from B to N could be either 70 + 180 = 250 degrees or the other way around. But since we want the smaller arc, it would be 360 - 250 = 110 degrees. So arc BN is 110 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe I should use coordinates to model this. Let me assign coordinates to simplify.

Let me place point O at the origin. Let me set up coordinate system where O is at (0,0). Let me suppose that point A is at angle θ, and point B is at angle θ + 140 degrees, since the central angle AOB is 140 degrees. But since M is the midpoint of arc AB, its angle would be θ + 70 degrees.

Then, point N is diametrically opposite to M. So if M is at angle φ, then N is at φ + 180 degrees. So if M is at θ + 70 degrees, then N is at θ + 70 + 180 = θ + 250 degrees.

Now, to find the arc BN. Let me compute the angle between points B and N. Point B is at θ + 140 degrees, and point N is at θ + 250 degrees. The difference between these angles is 250 - 140 = 110 degrees. So the arc from B to N is 110 degrees. Hence, arc BN measures 110 degrees. Therefore, the central angle BON is 110 degrees. 

Now, in triangle BNO, we have OB and ON as radii, so triangle BNO is isosceles with OB = ON. The vertex angle at O is 110 degrees. Therefore, the base angles at B and N are equal. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so each base angle is (180 - 110)/2 = 70/2 = 35 degrees. So angle at N, which is angle BNO, is 35 degrees. 

But wait, the problem asks for angle N. If angle N refers to angle BNO, then it's 35 degrees, which would correspond to option C. However, I need to confirm whether angle N is indeed angle BNO. 

Alternatively, maybe angle N refers to angle ANB or another angle. Let me verify.

Alternatively, angle N could be angle ANB. Let me think. If we connect BN, then angle at N between points A and B? Wait, but point A is not necessarily connected to N. Hmm.

Alternatively, since N is connected to B, and maybe angle at N between B and another point. For example, if we consider triangle BNM or something else. But according to the problem statement, after connecting BN, the angle N is asked. Given that, and given the options, if my previous calculation leads to angle BNO being 35 degrees, which is option C, that seems plausible.

But let me cross-validate. Another approach: Using inscribed angles.

Since arc BN is 110 degrees, then the inscribed angle subtended by arc BN would be half of that, which is 55 degrees. But that would be if the angle was subtended by arc BN. However, angle at N would depend on where the angle is. For instance, if we have angle NBA or angle NBM, etc. 

Wait, let's think again. If angle N is angle at N between points B and another point. If we consider triangle BNO, where O is the center, and angle at N is 35 degrees, as per earlier. But if the problem is referring to angle at N between B and another point, maybe M or A?

Wait, the problem says "connect BN", so the figure includes points B, N, and possibly others. If angle N is angle BNA, then that would be different. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe angle N is the inscribed angle over arc BA or something. Let me think again.

But given that the answer options include 35 degrees (option C) and 70 degrees (option A), and our calculation gave 35 degrees for angle BNO, which is a valid possibility, I think that might be the intended answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the arc BN calculation. Earlier, I assumed that arc BN is 110 degrees. How did I get that? By assuming that point N is at θ + 250 degrees, while point B is at θ + 140 degrees. The difference is 250 - 140 = 110 degrees. But that assumes that the arc from B to N goes clockwise, but depending on the direction, the arc could be measured differently. However, since arc BN is typically considered as the smaller arc unless stated otherwise. Since 110 degrees is less than 180, that would be the smaller arc. So arc BN is 110 degrees. Hence, central angle BON is 110 degrees. In triangle BNO, angles at B and N are (180 - 110)/2 = 35 degrees. So angle at N is 35 degrees. Which would be option C.

But wait, the problem says "connect BN, if angle AOB = 140.0, then the degree of angle N is ()". So angle N could be referring to angle at N in triangle BNO, which is 35 degrees. So answer C.

Alternatively, maybe angle N refers to angle ANB. Let's explore that. If we consider triangle ANB, what is angle at N? For that, we'd need to find arc AB or something else. Wait, angle ANB is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AB. Since arc AB is 140 degrees, then angle ANB would be half of that, which is 70 degrees. But that contradicts with previous conclusion. However, that would be if N were on the circumference such that AB is the intercepted arc. But in this case, N is located such that it's diametrically opposite to M. So maybe angle ANB is not directly related. Wait, but if N is positioned such that arc BN is 110 degrees, then angle ANB would depend on other arcs. 

Alternatively, maybe angle N refers to angle ANM or something else. This uncertainty suggests that I need to clarify what angle N refers to. However, given the problem statement and the options, the most plausible answer based on the triangle BNO is 35 degrees, which is option C. 

Another way to think: Since MN is a diameter, then angle at N subtended by BM would be a right angle. Wait, no, because if you have a triangle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite is a right angle. Wait, if you have a triangle with vertices at B, M, and N, where MN is a diameter. Wait, if N is diametrically opposite to M, then BN is a chord. Let me think about triangle BMN. Since MN is a diameter, then angle at B would be a right angle if BM is perpendicular to MN. Wait, not necessarily. Wait, Thales' theorem states that if you have a triangle inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. So if we had a triangle with vertices at B, M, and N, where MN is the diameter, then angle at B would be a right angle. But is that applicable here?

Wait, MN is a diameter. If we consider triangle BMN, then since MN is the diameter, then angle at B would be a right angle if and only if B lies on the circle. Which it does. So angle MBN is 90 degrees. Wait, but that may not help directly. However, we can combine this with other information.

But how does this relate to angle N? If angle MBN is 90 degrees, and we know other angles in the diagram, perhaps we can find relations. But I'm getting confused here. Let me refocus.

Earlier, calculating angle BNO as 35 degrees gives option C. But let's check again. Central angle BON is 110 degrees, leading to angle at N being 35 degrees. That seems solid. So why is there ambiguity? Well, perhaps the problem defines angle N as angle ANB instead. Let me check that scenario.

Suppose angle N is angle ANB. Then, to find that, we can use the inscribed angle theorem. The measure of angle ANB is half the measure of the arc AB that it intercepts. But angle ANB intercepts arc AB. However, the position of N affects which arc is intercepted. If N is on the opposite side of the circle from M, then angle ANB would intercept arc AB or the opposite arc. Wait, since N is diametrically opposite to M, which is the midpoint of arc AB, then depending on where N is, the intercepted arc could be different. 

For instance, if N is on the opposite side of the circle from arc AB, then angle ANB would intercept arc AB or the rest. Let me think. If you have points A and B on the circle, and N somewhere else. Angle ANB is an inscribed angle, so it intercepts arc AB that doesn't contain N. Since N is on the opposite side from arc AB, the intercepted arc would be arc AB itself, which is 140 degrees. Therefore, angle ANB would be half of that, which is 70 degrees. That would give option A. But this contradicts the previous result. So which one is correct?

This shows that the interpretation of angle N is critical. The problem statement says "connect BN, if angle AOB = 140.0, then the degree of angle N is ()". It's ambiguous, but in many geometry problems, angle N would refer to the angle at N formed by points B and another point. Since BN is connected, and the other connection is from N to M or N to O? Or is there another line?

Wait, the problem says "connect BN" — so we have points B and N connected. The question is about angle N. In geometry, when a problem refers to "angle N", it often implies the angle at point N. If there are two segments meeting at N, then those segments would be part of the figure. Since we have BN connected, and possibly other connections. Let me check the original problem again:

"Connect MO and extend it to intersect circle O at point N, connect BN, if angle AOB = 140.0, then the degree of angle N is ()".

After connecting BN, the figure consists of points A, B, M, N on the circle, O as the center. Lines include MO extended to N, BN, and possibly others. So, at point N, which segments are connected? N is connected to B (from BN), and since N is on the circle, and O is the center, there might be line NO. So angle at N could be between BN and NO. That would be angle BNO, which we previously calculated as 35 degrees. Alternatively, angle between BN and NM, if NM exists. But NM is part of the diameter.

Alternatively, if the problem refers to angle ANB, which would be angle at N between A and B. But since N is on the circle, and A and B are fixed points, angle ANB would depend on N's position.

Given the confusion, let me re-examine the initial steps.

Earlier, I calculated that angle BNO is 35 degrees. This is based on triangle BNO having central angle 110 degrees, leading to base angles of 35 degrees each. This seems mathematically sound.

However, if angle N is angle ANB, then it would be 70 degrees. But why? Because angle ANB would subtend arc AB, which is 140 degrees, hence 70 degrees. But this would imply that N is positioned such that it's not on the same semicircle as AB. Wait, if N is diametrically opposite to M, which is on arc AB, then N is on the opposite side. So angle ANB would still intercept arc AB, giving 70 degrees. But this would mean answer A. But this contradicts with the previous calculation. 

This inconsistency arises due to ambiguity in the definition of angle N. To resolve this, I need to look back at the problem's structure. The problem mentions "connect BN", so the angle N is likely referring to an angle involving BN. If the problem is from a standard source, perhaps there's a conventional way to interpret it. 

In Chinese textbooks or Olympiad problems, sometimes angle N refers to the angle at N formed by the last constructed segment. Since we connected BN, and the last construction is BN, then angle N might be the angle at N between B and another point connected to N. Since N is connected to B and O (because O is the center), angle BNO is the angle at N between B and O. That would make sense. Hence, angle BNO is 35 degrees, which is option C. 

Alternatively, if the problem considers angle N as part of triangle ANB, then it's 70 degrees (option A). But how to decide?

Looking back at the given predicates, there's a predicate called "IsDiameterOf(Line(M,N),Circle(O))", which confirms that MN is a diameter. Also, there's a Line(O,A), Line(O,B), etc. So O is the center, and N is on the circle. 

If we consider triangle BNO, with O as the center, then angle at N is 35 degrees. This seems consistent. Therefore, the answer should be option C: 35 degrees.

Thus, after careful consideration, I conclude the answer is C.
