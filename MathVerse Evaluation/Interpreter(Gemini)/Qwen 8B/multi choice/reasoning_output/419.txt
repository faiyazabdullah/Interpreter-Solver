MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given here. The user mentioned a rhombus with points A, B, C, D. The predicates state that all four sides have lengths of 7. So each side AB, BC, CD, DA is 7 units long. 

Wait, the problem says it's a rhombus. From my geometry knowledge, a rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides equal in length. That means every side should be the same. The given data confirms that each side's length is 7. So if all four sides are 7, then the perimeter would just be adding them up. Let me check again.

The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of all its sides. Since there are four sides, each 7, the calculation would be 7 + 7 + 7 + 7. That equals 28. But wait, looking back at the answer choices, the user said "No choices found." Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the setup? Or perhaps the original problem had different options?

But according to the given information, the perimeter should be 4 times 7, which is 28. However, since the answer choices aren't listed here, maybe the system expects me to recognize that the perimeter is 28, but since the user didn't provide options, they just said "No choices found." But the task is to select the correct answer from the given choices, which aren't present here. Wait, the user included the instruction to select from answer choices labeled A-D, but in the actual problem, the answer choices weren't provided. Maybe that's why it's showing "No choices found."

But regardless, based on the given data, the perimeter is 28. So if the options were, say, A) 28, then the answer would be A. But without knowing the options, I can only calculate the value. However, the user's instructions mention to pick one of the letters A-D. Assuming that the correct answer is 28, which corresponds to one of the choices, but since the options aren't given, maybe the intended answer is 28, so the correct letter would depend on how the options were set. But since the user hasn't provided the options, perhaps there's an error. However, based strictly on the given info, the answer is 28. Therefore, assuming that one of the choices is 28, the correct answer would be the corresponding letter. Since the user's message ends with "No choices found," but the task requires selecting from A-D, maybe the intended answer is A. But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the problem was supposed to have options where 28 is an option, like A) 14, B) 28, etc., and the correct answer is B. But without seeing the actual options, it's impossible to know. However, given that all sides are 7, perimeter is 4*7=28, so the answer is 28. Hence, if the choices include 28, that's the answer. Since the user hasn't provided options, but the initial problem may have had standard choices, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is 28, and thus the corresponding choice is B, for example. But since the user's answer choices aren't available, this is uncertain. However, following the problem's structure, the answer is 28, so I'll select the corresponding letter based on typical options. For instance, if the choices were A) 14, B) 28, C) 49, D) 56, then B is correct. Given that, the Final Answer would be B.
