MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have triangle ABC, and it's given that AB is congruent to BC, making it an isosceles triangle. Also, there are some equations involving the lengths of the sides expressed in terms of x. Let me parse all the given information carefully.

First, the predicates mention that Triangle(A,B,C) is isosceles, and specifically, AB ≅ BC. That means two sides are equal: AB and BC. Wait, but in an isosceles triangle, the two equal sides are called the legs, and the unequal side is the base. But here, since AB ≅ BC, that would mean the legs are AB and BC, so the base would be AC. However, sometimes people refer to the vertex angle as the angle between the two equal sides. So in this case, vertex at B? Because AB and BC meet at point B. So angle at B is the vertex angle.

But the problem also gives equations for the lengths of each side in terms of x. Let me note those down:

Length of AB = 2x - 7
Length of BC = 4x - 21
Length of AC = x - 3

Additionally, it says that AB ≅ BC, which means their lengths are equal. Therefore, setting the expressions for AB and BC equal to each other should give us an equation to solve for x.

So, setting 2x - 7 = 4x - 21. Let me write that out:

2x - 7 = 4x - 21

Subtract 2x from both sides: -7 = 2x - 21

Then add 21 to both sides: 14 = 2x → x = 7.

Wait, but before I get too excited, I need to check if this value of x makes sense in all contexts. For example, the length of each side must be positive because they are lengths. Let me verify each expression with x=7:

AB: 2*7 -7 = 14 -7 = 7 units
BC: 4*7 -21 = 28 -21 = 7 units
AC: 7 -3 = 4 units

So AB and BC are both 7, and AC is 4. That seems okay. All lengths are positive. 

But wait, the problem mentions that the triangle is isosceles with AB ≅ BC. So with these lengths, AB=BC=7 and AC=4, which fits. But maybe there's another way to approach this?

Alternatively, could there be another scenario where different sides are equal? Like if AB was congruent to AC or BC to AC? But the problem states explicitly that AB ≅ BC, so that's fixed. So our initial approach is correct.

However, let me check if substituting x=7 into the length of AC gives a valid triangle. The triangle inequality states that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

Check:

AB + BC > AC: 7 + 7 = 14 > 4 ✔️
AB + AC > BC: 7 + 4 = 11 > 7 ✔️
BC + AC > AB: same as above, 7+4=11>7 ✔️

All inequalities hold, so x=7 is valid.

Therefore, the value of x is 7. Now, the question asks for AB. Since AB is 2x -7, plugging x=7 gives AB = 2*7 -7 = 7. So AB equals 7. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 7. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't misread anything. The problem says "Find A B if triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB ≅ BC." Wait, does "Find A B" mean find the length of AB? Or perhaps there's confusion in translation? Because the variables A, B, C are points, so maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, looking back:

The original question says: "Find A B if △ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB ≅ BC."

But AB is a segment, so "Find A B" probably refers to finding the length of AB. Given that, and since AB equals 7 when x=7, the answer is 7, which corresponds to choice C. Hence, Final Answer: C.
