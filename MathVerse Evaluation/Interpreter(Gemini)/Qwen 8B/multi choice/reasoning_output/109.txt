MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So the question says that angle α is 130 degrees, and we need to find angle β. Let me start by going through the given predicates step by step.

First, there's a triangle ABC. That means points A, B, and C form a triangle. Then there's a RightAngle at Angle(B,A,C). Wait, so angle at point A between points B and C? Or wait, the notation Angle(B,A,C) would mean the angle at point A formed by points B, A, C. But since it's a right angle, that tells us that triangle ABC has a right angle at A. Wait, but if angle BAC is 90 degrees, then triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A.

But then there's another part where MeasureOf(Angle(α),130). Hmm, angle α is mentioned here. Also, Add(MeasureOf(Angle(α)),MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)),180). Wait, Angle(C,A,B) is the same as angle at point A between points C, A, B. Which is the same as angle BAC. Wait, but earlier we were told that angle BAC is a right angle, 90 degrees. But according to this Add predicate, measure of α plus measure of angle CAB equals 180. Wait, angle CAB is the same as angle BAC, which was said to be 90 degrees. So if α + 90 = 180, then α would be 90 degrees. But the problem states that angle α is 130 degrees. There seems to be a contradiction here. Maybe I misinterpreted something?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the notation. Let me clarify. The Angle(α) might refer to a different angle. Wait, the first part says MeasureOf(Angle(α),130). So angle α measures 130 degrees. Then the Add predicate says that MeasureOf(Angle(α)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) = 180. So angle α plus angle CAB equals 180. But angle CAB is part of triangle ABC. Wait, but earlier we had a RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C)), which is angle BAC, so that's 90 degrees. Therefore, substituting into the equation: 130 + 90 = 220, which doesn't equal 180. That can't be right. There must be some misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps angle α isn't referring to angle CAB. Let me re-examine the predicates. The Angle(α) is mentioned separately. Maybe angle α is another angle in the diagram. Let me think again. The problem mentions points A, B, C forming a triangle, and there's a right angle at BAC (since RightAngle(Angle(B,A,C))). So triangle ABC has a right angle at A. Then, there's another angle α, which measures 130 degrees. How does that fit in?

Then there's the Add predicate: MeasureOf(Angle(α)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) = 180. Angle(C,A,B) is angle at A between C, A, B, which is the right angle. Wait, but that would make angle α + 90 = 180 → angle α = 90. However, the problem says angle α is 130. This inconsistency suggests that maybe my interpretation is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps angle α is not part of triangle ABC but another angle in the figure.

Alternatively, maybe angle α is an external angle or something else. Let me check other parts. There's also MeasureOf(Angle(β), $), which probably needs to be solved. And another Add predicate: MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) = 180. Angle(A,C,B) is angle at C between A, C, B. So that's angle ACB. 

So putting this together: In triangle ABC, which is right-angled at A. So angles at B and C sum to 90 degrees because total angles in triangle sum to 180. But then there's angle α = 130, which is added to angle CAB (which is 90) equals 180. That doesn't work unless angle α is not inside the triangle. Maybe angle α is an exterior angle?

Wait, suppose angle α is an exterior angle at point B. For example, if we extend one of the sides. Let me visualize. Suppose triangle ABC with right angle at A. Let's say AB and AC are legs, BC the hypotenuse. If we extend side AB beyond B, creating an exterior angle. But how does that relate to angle α being 130?

Alternatively, maybe angle α is adjacent to angle CAB. Since angle CAB is 90 degrees, and angle α is 130, then they could form a linear pair, adding up to 180. Wait, that would make sense. If angle α is supplementary to angle CAB. Because if two angles are adjacent and form a straight line, their sum is 180. So if angle CAB is 90 degrees, then angle α would be 90 degrees, but the problem says it's 130. Hmm, still conflicting.

Wait, maybe angle α is not adjacent to CAB but part of another triangle. Let me consider that. Suppose there's another triangle involving angle α. For instance, if there's a transversal or some intersecting lines. Alternatively, perhaps angle α is part of a quadrilateral. Wait, but the problem statement mentions Triangle(A,B,C), so maybe there's more than one triangle involved.

Looking back at the predicates, there's PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(m)) and PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(m)). So points A and B lie on line m. So line m contains points A and B. So line AB is part of line m. Then, since triangle ABC exists, point C is not on line m. Now, angle α is 130 degrees. Perhaps angle α is formed by line m and another line. For example, if there's a line from point C making an angle with line m.

Alternatively, considering the Add predicate: MeasureOf(Angle(α)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) = 180. Angle(C,A,B) is angle at A, which is 90 degrees. So 130 + 90 = 220 ≠ 180. So this suggests that either my understanding of the angle notation is incorrect, or there's a different configuration.

Wait, maybe Angle(C,A,B) refers to a different angle. Wait, Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at point A between points C, A, B. Which is angle CAB. So that's the right angle. So the equation is angle α + 90 = 180 ⇒ angle α = 90. But the problem states angle α is 130. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation.

Alternative possibility: Maybe the angle α is not in the same triangle. Let me consider that angle α is an external angle to triangle ABC. For example, if we have a triangle ABC with right angle at A, and then an external angle at point B. Let me think about the exterior angles. The exterior angle at B would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. But angle α is given as 130 degrees. If that's the case, then maybe angle α is an exterior angle at B, which equals angle A + angle C. But angle A is 90 degrees, so angle C would be 130 - 90 = 40 degrees. Then angle β could be related to angle C?

Wait, looking at the other Add predicate: MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) = 180. Angle(A,C,B) is angle at C, which in triangle ABC would be angle ACB. If angle ACB is 40 degrees, then angle β would be 180 - 40 = 140? But that doesn't align with the options given. Alternatively, maybe angle β is another angle.

Wait, the problem says "angle β = ()" with options A-D. Let me try to reconstruct.

Assuming that angle α is an exterior angle at B, then its measure is equal to the sum of the two opposite interior angles. So angle α = angle A + angle C. Given angle α is 130, angle A is 90, then angle C is 130 - 90 = 40 degrees. So angle C (angle ACB) is 40 degrees. Then, looking at the second equation: MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) = 180. Angle(A,C,B) is angle ACB, which is 40 degrees. Therefore, angle β = 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. But none of the options are 140. So this can't be.

Alternatively, maybe angle β is an angle in triangle ABC. Let me see. In triangle ABC, angles at A=90, at B and C sum to 90. If angle C is 40, then angle B would be 50 degrees. Then, if angle β is angle B, then β is 50 degrees, which is option C. That fits! So let me check again.

If angle α is an exterior angle at B, then it equals angle A + angle C. So 130 = 90 + angle C → angle C = 40. Then, angle B is 90 - angle C = 50. So angle β could be angle B, which is 50 degrees. Hence, answer C. But why does the Add predicate mention angle β + angle ACB = 180? Wait, angle ACB is angle C, which is 40. So angle β would be 180 - 40 = 140. But that contradicts. Unless angle β is something else.

Wait, maybe angle β is the supplement of angle ACB. But if angle ACB is 40, then angle β would be 140. But that's not among the options except if there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps angle β is another angle in the diagram. Maybe angle β is angle at B, which is 50 degrees. So why does the Add(predicate) say angle β + angle ACB = 180? That would imply angle β is 140, but angle β could be something else. Maybe there's confusion in notation.

Let me re-examine the predicates:

- MeasureOf(Angle(β), $) – this implies angle β has a certain measure to find.
- Add(MeasureOf(Angle(β)),MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)),180) – so angle β + angle ACB = 180. So angle β is supplementary to angle ACB.

Earlier, we found angle ACB is 40 degrees, so angle β would be 140. But this isn't one of the options. Wait, but maybe angle β is not angle ACB but another angle. Wait, angle(A,C,B) is angle at C, which is angle ACB. So angle β + angle ACB = 180. So if angle ACB is 40, then angle β is 140. But 140 isn't an option. Hmm.

But earlier, we thought angle B is 50 degrees. Where does that come in? Let me think again. In triangle ABC, angles sum to 180. Angle at A is 90, angles at B and C sum to 90. If angle ACB is 40, then angle ABC is 50. So angle ABC is 50 degrees. So if angle β is angle ABC, then it's 50 degrees. But according to the Add predicate, angle β + angle ACB = 180. So 50 + 40 = 90, which is not 180. So that doesn't fit.

This suggests that my assumption about angle α being an exterior angle may be incorrect. Let me try another approach.

Given that in the predicates, there's a right angle at A (angle BAC is 90 degrees). Then, the Add predicate says angle α + angle CAB = 180. Angle CAB is 90, so angle α should be 90, but it's given as 130. This inconsistency indicates that perhaps angle α is not part of the triangle but another angle.

Maybe angle α is outside the triangle. For example, if there's a line extending from AB or AC, forming an angle with another line. Suppose line m passes through points A and B, as per the PointLiesOnLine predicates. Then, maybe angle α is formed by line m and another line connected to point C. For example, if there's a line from point C to some other point, forming angle α with line m.

Suppose line m is AB. Then, if we draw a line from C to a point D on line m, forming an angle α at point B. Wait, but how does that connect?

Alternatively, angle α could be formed by extending BC or something. Let me imagine: triangle ABC, right-angled at A. Extend AB beyond B to a point D, such that angle CBD is angle α. If angle α is 130 degrees, then in that case, angle CBD is 130. But how does that relate to other angles?

In that case, angle ABC (angle at B in triangle ABC) would be adjacent to angle CBD. So angle ABC + angle CBD = 180. So angle ABC = 180 - 130 = 50 degrees. Then, in triangle ABC, angles at A=90, at B=50, so angle at C=40 degrees. Then, looking at the other equation: MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) = 180. Angle(A,C,B) is angle at C, which is 40. So angle β = 180 - 40 = 140. Still not matching options. But angle β could be angle ABC, which is 50, which is option C.

But how does angle β relate to the given equations? If angle β is angle ABC, then the Add(predicate) says angle β + angle ACB = 180. But angle ABC is 50, angle ACB is 40, sum is 90. Not 180. So that's not matching. 

Wait, maybe angle β is an exterior angle at point C. If angle ACB is 40, then the exterior angle at C would be 180 - 40 = 140. But again, not matching options. 

Alternatively, maybe angle β is the supplement of angle ABC. If angle ABC is 50, then β would be 130, but that's already angle α. 

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me go back to the initial problem.

The problem gives several predicates. Let me list them again:

- Points A, B, C form a triangle.
- Right angle at BAC (so angle BAC is 90).
- MeasureOf(angle α) is 130.
- Add(angle α + angle CAB = 180) → which would mean angle α + 90 = 180 → angle α = 90. But given as 130. Contradiction. So this suggests that angle α is not angle CAB. So angle α must be another angle.

Perhaps angle α is an angle outside the triangle. Let me assume that. Suppose angle α is an exterior angle at point B. Then, angle α would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. So angle α = angle A + angle C. Given angle A is 90, angle α is 130, so angle C = 130 - 90 = 40 degrees. Then, angle at C is 40. 

Now, in triangle ABC, angles at B and C sum to 90. So angle B = 90 - angle C = 90 - 40 = 50 degrees. 

Now, looking at the other equation: MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) = 180. Angle(A,C,B) is angle at C, which is 40 degrees. So angle β = 180 - 40 = 140. But this isn't one of the options. However, angle β could be angle B, which is 50 degrees. But how does that tie in with the equation?

Wait, maybe there's a typo in the predicate. Perhaps it's supposed to be angle β + angle at B = 180? Or maybe angle β is an exterior angle at B. If angle β is an exterior angle at B, then it would be equal to angle A + angle C = 130. But angle α is already 130. So that would make angle β = angle α, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if angle β is the supplement of angle at C. So angle β = 180 - angle C = 140, which again isn't an option. 

Wait, the options are A:30, B:40, C:50, D:65. So if angle C is 40, then angle β might be 40. But why? 

Looking at the Add(predicate): MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) = 180. Angle(A,C,B) is angle at C, which is 40. So angle β = 180 - 40 = 140. But 140 isn't an option. So this suggests that my previous assumptions are wrong.

Let me try a different approach. Since the problem involves a right triangle and an angle α of 130, maybe it's a combination of angles in a different configuration. 

Consider that angle α is 130, which is greater than 90. So it's likely an obtuse angle. If this angle is formed by two lines, like in a quadrilateral or another triangle. Suppose we have triangle ABC with right angle at A, and then another triangle or line forming angle α.

For example, if we extend AB beyond B to a point D, forming a straight line. Then, angle between DC and DA could be angle α. Wait, but without seeing the figure, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe angle α is part of a larger triangle. For instance, if there's a triangle ABD where angle at B is α. But this is too vague.

Another thought: Maybe angle α is the third angle in a triangle where two angles are known. For example, if angle α is part of a triangle with angles 130 and something else. But I need to relate this to the given predicates.

Wait, the Add(predicate) says MeasureOf(Angle(α)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) = 180. Angle(C,A,B) is angle at A, which is 90 degrees. So this implies angle α = 90 degrees. But the problem states angle α is 130. This contradiction suggests that either the problem has a typo or my understanding is incorrect. 

Wait, could Angle(C,A,B) refer to something else? Like, maybe it's not angle at A but another angle? No, Angle(C,A,B) is standard notation for the angle at A between points C, A, B. So that's definitely angle BAC. So this leads to the conclusion that angle α + 90 = 180 → α = 90. But the problem says α is 130. This is conflicting. 

Unless... unless the Angle(C,A,B) is not angle BAC but another angle. Wait, maybe it's angle at B? No, the notation Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y. So Angle(C,A,B) is angle at A. 

This suggests that there is a mistake in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try to ignore the Add(predicate) for a moment and focus on other parts.

We know that in triangle ABC, angle at A is 90 degrees. So angles at B and C sum to 90. If we can find one of these angles, we can find the other. 

From the given, angle α is 130. Maybe angle α is an exterior angle at B. As before, that would make it equal to angle A + angle C = 90 + angle C. Setting this equal to 130: 90 + angle C = 130 → angle C = 40. Then angle B = 50. 

If angle β is angle B, then it's 50 degrees, which is option C. 

Even though the Add(predicate) seems to conflict, perhaps it's a misinterpretation. Let me check again. The Add(predicate) says MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) = 180. Angle(A,C,B) is angle at C, which is 40. So angle β = 140. But if angle β is angle B, it's 50. So this suggests that angle β is not angle B. 

But maybe angle β is the supplement of angle C? If angle β = 180 - 40 = 140, but that's not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle β is an angle in another triangle. For example, if there's a triangle where angle β is adjacent to angle C. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves two triangles. One is triangle ABC, right-angled at A. Another triangle involving angle α and β. 

Since angle α is 130, and it's supplementary to angle CAB (90), then angle α is 130. This suggests that angle α is formed by extending a side. For example, extending BC to form an angle with AB. 

If we extend BC beyond C to a point D, forming angle at C between BC and CD. But this is getting too speculative. 

Alternatively, since there's a line m containing points A and B, maybe angle α is formed at point B by line m and another line. For instance, if there's a line from B making an angle α with line m. 

If line m is AB, then extending BA beyond A or B. Suppose we have a line from B making an angle α with line m. If line m is AB, then extending BA beyond A would form a straight line. But angle α is 130, which is obtuse. So if at point B, there's a line making 130 degrees with line m (AB). 

This would create an angle at B of 130 degrees, which would mean that in triangle ABC, angle at B is 130, but that can't be because angle at A is already 90, making the sum of angles exceed 180. So that's impossible. 

Wait, but maybe angle α is an external angle at B. If angle α is 130, then it's equal to the sum of the non-adjacent interior angles. So angle α = angle A + angle C. So 130 = 90 + angle C → angle C = 40. Then angle B = 90 - 40 = 50. 

Now, the other equation: MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) = 180. Angle(A,C,B) is angle C = 40. So angle β = 180 - 40 = 140. But this isn't an option. However, if angle β is angle B, which is 50, then it's option C. But how does that relate to the equation? 

Unless the equation is actually MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)) = 180. Wait, Angle(C,B,A) is angle at B, which is 50. So 50 + 40 = 90 ≠ 180. Still doesn't fit. 

Maybe the equation is referring to a different angle. For example, if angle β is the supplement of angle B. So angle β = 180 - angle B = 180 - 50 = 130. But that's angle α. 

I'm really confused now. Let me try to look for patterns in the answer choices. The options are 30, 40, 50, 65. If angle C is 40, then angle B is 50. So option C is 50. This seems plausible. Even though the equation seems off, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the Add(predicate). 

Maybe the Add(predicate) is supposed to say MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B)) = 180, where Angle(C,A,B) is angle at B. Wait, no, Angle(C,A,B) is angle at A. 

Wait, maybe the user made a typo and meant Angle(B,A,C) instead of Angle(C,A,B)? Let me check. Angle(B,A,C) is angle at A, which is 90. If it were Angle(B,C,A), that would be angle at C. 

If the Add(predicate) was MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A)) = 180, then angle β + angle C = 180. But angle C is 40, so angle β would be 140. Still not matching. 

Alternatively, if the Add(predicate) is MeasureOf(Angle(β)) + MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)) = 180. Angle(B,A,C) is 90, so angle β = 90. But that's not an option. 

At this point, despite the inconsistencies in the predicates, the most consistent answer based on the given data is angle β = 50 degrees, which is option C. This comes from assuming that angle α is an exterior angle at B, leading to angle C = 40 and angle B = 50. Even though the Add(predicate) seems contradictory, it's possible that there was a mistake in the problem setup, and the intended relationship is angle β = angle B = 50. 

Thus, the correct answer is C.
