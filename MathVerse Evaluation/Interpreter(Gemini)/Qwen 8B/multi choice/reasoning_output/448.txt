QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(\frac{20}{29},-\frac{21}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\tan a$.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the tangent of angle 'a' given that the terminal side of the angle intersects a unit circle at the point P(20/29, -21/29). The center of the circle is the origin, O, and the radius is 1. 

First, I need to recall some basics about trigonometry and the unit circle. In the unit circle, any point (x, y) on the circle corresponds to the coordinates (cosθ, sinθ) where θ is the angle formed with the positive x-axis. Since the radius is 1, the hypotenuse here is 1, making things simpler because sine and cosine are just the y and x coordinates respectively.

So, if angle 'a' is in standard position, its terminal side passes through point P(20/29, -21/29). That means the x-coordinate is cos(a) and the y-coordinate is sin(a). Therefore, cos(a) = 20/29 and sin(a) = -21/29. 

Now, the tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of sine to cosine. So tan(a) = sin(a)/cos(a). Plugging in the values we have, that would be (-21/29)/(20/29). The denominators cancel out, leaving -21/20. 

Wait, but let me make sure there's no mistake here. Let me check again. The coordinates are (x, y) = (20/29, -21/29). So yes, x is adjacent over hypotenuse, which is cos(a), and y is opposite over hypotenuse, which is sin(a). Then tan(a) is opposite over adjacent, so y/x. Which would indeed be (-21/29)/(20/29) = -21/20. 

But wait, could there be another way to approach this? Maybe using the Pythagorean identity? Let me verify if the point lies on the unit circle. The radius is 1, so x² + y² should equal 1. Let's compute (20/29)^2 + (-21/29)^2. That's (400 + 441)/841 = 841/841 = 1. Yep, that checks out. So the point is valid on the unit circle. 

Therefore, my calculation seems correct. The tangent is simply the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate, which gives -21/20. 

Looking back at the answer choices, even though they aren't listed here, the process leads us to -21/20. But since the user mentioned "no choices found," maybe it's expecting me to provide the numerical value. However, according to the instructions, I need to choose among options A-D, but since the original problem didn't list them, perhaps the actual answer is -21/20, which would correspond to one of the choices. Assuming that the options include this fraction, the correct answer would be the one matching -21/20. But without seeing the options, I have to rely on the calculation. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation? Wait, let me recheck. The x-coordinate is 20/29, y is -21/29. So tan(a) = y/x = (-21/29)/(20/29) = -21/20. Yes, that's correct. So unless there's something about the quadrant that affects the sign, but since the point is in the fourth quadrant (positive x, negative y), tangent is negative, which aligns with our result. 

I think that's solid. So the answer is -21/20. But since the answer choices weren't provided, the system expects me to pick the corresponding letter. However, the original problem says "No choices found," but the user still wants the answer in the specified format. Since the actual answer is -21/20, but the options were not given, perhaps there was an error. However, following the instructions strictly, I'll assume that the intended answer is -21/20, which would correspond to one of the letters. Without knowing the options, but based on standard problems, this is a common type. Hence, I'll proceed with the conclusion.
