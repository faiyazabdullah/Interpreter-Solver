QUESTION:
There is a hyperbolic function with its center at the origin. The graph approaches zero as $∣x∣$ increases, and the function is undefined at x=0. There are four points labeled at (1/6,6), (6,1/6), (-1/6,-6), (-6,-1/6). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question mentions a hyperbolic function centered at the origin, approaching zero as |x| increases, and it's undefined at x=0. Then there are four points given with coordinates: (1/6,6), (6,1/6), (-1/6,-6), (-6,-1/6). The task is to find the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

Hmm, hyperbola... Right, hyperbolas have two branches and asymptotes. Since the function is undefined at x=0, maybe it's a hyperbola with vertical or horizontal asymptotes? Wait, but the problem says the graph approaches zero as |x| increases. That sounds like the function tends towards zero as x becomes very large in magnitude. So maybe it's a rectangular hyperbola?

Let me recall: The standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin can be either horizontal or vertical. For example, y = k/x is a hyperbola with vertical asymptote at x=0 and horizontal asymptote at y=0. But wait, if we consider the function f(x) = k/x, then as |x| increases, f(x) approaches zero. Also, it's undefined at x=0. That fits the description given. 

Looking at the points provided: Let's check if these points lie on such a hyperbola. Take point A (6, 1/6). If we plug x=6 into y=k/x, then y should be k/6. Here, y is 1/6, so k would be 1. Similarly, point B (1/6, 6): plugging x=1/6 gives y = k/(1/6) = 6k. This equals 6, so 6k=6 implies k=1. Same for the other points: Point C (-1/6, -6): y = k/x => -6 = k/(-1/6) → k = (-6)*(-1/6) = 1. And point D (-6, -1/6): y = k/x → -1/6 = k/(-6) → k = (-1/6)*(-6)=1. So all points satisfy y = x^{-1} (since k=1). Therefore, the function is f(x) = 1/x.

Wait, but the question mentions a hyperbolic function with its center at the origin. The standard hyperbola equation could also be xy = c^2, which is equivalent to y = c^2 /x. In our case, since k=1, it's y = 1/x, which is indeed a hyperbola. 

Now, the domain of f(x) = 1/x is all real numbers except x=0, because division by zero is undefined. The range is also all real numbers except y=0, since 1/x can never be zero. However, the problem states that the function approaches zero as |x| increases. Which aligns with the behavior of 1/x as x approaches infinity or negative infinity, where y approaches zero.

But wait, the question says the function is undefined at x=0, which matches. So the domain is all real numbers except 0, which in interval notation is (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞). The range is also all real numbers except 0, so same interval notation.

However, looking back at the problem statement, the answer choices are labeled A-D, but the user mentioned "No choices found." But according to the instructions, I need to provide the answer as one of the options. But since there are no choices given, perhaps the original problem had options, but they weren't included here. But regardless, based on the analysis, the domain and range are both all real numbers except zero. So in interval notation, that's (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞).

So the correct answer would be the domain and range both being (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞). But since the answer choices aren't provided, but the user said to choose from A-D, but in the initial prompt, the answer choices were "No choices found." Maybe there was a mistake, but assuming the intended answer is that domain and range are both (-infty, 0) union (0, infty). Hence, the answer is likely option A, B, C, or D depending on how they were presented. But without seeing the actual choices, I'll go with the conclusion based on the analysis.

Therefore, the Final Answer would be the interval notation for domain and range. Since the user hasn't provided options, but the system requires selecting from A-D, perhaps the answer is A, but I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the options are different. But given the problem, the answer is domain and range both as (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞). Assuming that one of the choices corresponds to this, but since the user hasn't specified, I'll proceed with the answer as per the analysis.
