MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a regular hexagon named U, V, W, X, Y, Z. All sides are 12 cm each, and it's given that line WY is perpendicular to line XU. We need to find the length of WY.

First, I remember that in a regular hexagon, all sides are equal and all internal angles are 120 degrees. Also, the opposite sides are parallel. But here, there's a specific condition about two lines being perpendicular: WY and XU. Hmm, so maybe these diagonals intersect at a right angle?

Wait, in a regular hexagon, the diagonals can form various angles depending on how they cross. Let me visualize a regular hexagon. Let's label the vertices in order: U, V, W, X, Y, Z connected back to U. So each vertex is adjacent to the next one.

Now, the lines mentioned are WY and XU. Let me think about where those points are. Point W is connected to X, and point Y is connected to Z. Wait, but WY would be connecting W to Y, skipping some vertices. Similarly, XU connects X to U. 

Let me try to sketch this mentally. In a regular hexagon, the distance between non-adjacent vertices can vary. For example, the length of a diagonal depends on how many vertices apart the points are. Since it's regular, all sides are equal, and the diagonals can be categorized based on their lengths.

But since the hexagon is regular, it can be inscribed in a circle. Each side corresponds to a central angle of 60 degrees because 360 divided by 6 is 60. So each vertex is 60 degrees apart around the center.

So if I consider the coordinates of the points, maybe I can compute the coordinates of W, Y, X, and U, then calculate the vectors for WY and XU to check their slopes and see if they are perpendicular. Alternatively, use vector math or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, perhaps using properties of regular hexagons. In a regular hexagon, the length of a diagonal that skips one vertex (like from U to W) is twice the side length times sin(60°). Wait, maybe I should recall that in a regular hexagon, the radius of the circumscribed circle is equal to the side length. So each vertex is at a distance equal to the side length from the center.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the side length is 'a'. Then the distance from the center to any vertex (the radius) is also 'a'. The diagonals can be calculated based on the number of edges they skip. For instance, the longest diagonal (connecting two opposite vertices) is 2a. But other diagonals like those connecting vertices with one vertex in between are longer than the side but shorter than the diameter.

But in our case, the lines WY and XU. Let me figure out how many edges apart W and Y are. Starting from W, going clockwise: W to X to Y. So W to Y skips one vertex (X). Therefore, the distance between W and Y would be the same as the length of a diagonal that spans two edges? Or wait, maybe not. Let me count the steps between W and Y. From W to X is one edge, X to Y is another. So W to Y is two edges apart? Or maybe three?

Wait, in a regular hexagon, each vertex is connected to the next. So W is connected to X and V. Y is connected to X and Z. So W and Y are separated by two edges: W-X-Y. So the straight-line distance between W and Y would be... Let me think about the structure.

Another way: in a regular hexagon, the diagonals can be thought of as vectors. If I assign coordinates to the hexagon, maybe it's easier. Let's place the hexagon on a coordinate system with its center at the origin. Let me assume the side length is 12 cm.

For simplicity, let me assign coordinates. Let’s suppose the regular hexagon has vertices labeled in order U, V, W, X, Y, Z. Let me assign coordinates assuming the center is at (0,0) and the first vertex U is at (a, 0), where 'a' is the distance from the center to a vertex (which equals the side length in a regular hexagon).

Wait, actually, in a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to a vertex is equal to the side length. So if the side length is 12 cm, then each vertex is 12 units from the center.

So let me define the coordinates of each vertex. Let me recall that the coordinates of a regular hexagon can be determined using angles. Each vertex is spaced at 60-degree increments. Let me denote the six vertices as follows:

Starting from U at angle 0°, then moving counter-clockwise:

- U: angle 0°
- V: 60°
- W: 120°
- X: 180°
- Y: 240°
- Z: 300°

Wait, but depending on the direction of rotation. Assuming standard position, starting from positive x-axis, increasing counter-clockwise.

So coordinates for each point:

Each point's coordinates can be represented as (r*cosθ, r*sinθ), where r is the radius (equal to the side length, 12 cm here), and θ is the angle from the positive x-axis.

So:

Point U: angle 0° → (12, 0)

Point V: 60° → (12cos60°, 12sin60°) = (6, 6√3)

Point W: 120° → (12cos120°, 12sin120°) = (-6, 6√3)

Point X: 180° → (-12, 0)

Point Y: 240° → (12cos240°, 12sin240°) = (-6, -6√3)

Point Z: 300° → (12cos300°, 12sin300°) = (6, -6√3)

Now, let's get coordinates for W, Y, X, and U.

W is at (-6, 6√3)

Y is at (-6, -6√3)

X is at (-12, 0)

U is at (12, 0)

So line WY connects points W(-6, 6√3) and Y(-6, -6√3). Wait, looking at these coordinates, W and Y have the same x-coordinate, -6. So the line WY is vertical, since x is constant. Therefore, the slope of WY is undefined (vertical line).

Then line XU connects X(-12, 0) and U(12, 0). These two points have the same y-coordinate, 0, so the line XU is horizontal. Hence, the slope of XU is 0.

Therefore, WY is vertical and XU is horizontal, so they are indeed perpendicular. Which matches the given condition that they are perpendicular. So this confirms the setup is consistent.

Now, the question asks for the length of WY. Since WY is a vertical line from (-6, 6√3) to (-6, -6√3). The distance between these two points is the difference in their y-coordinates.

Calculating the length:

Δy = (-6√3) - (6√3) = -12√3. Taking absolute value, 12√3. So the length of WY is 12√3 cm.

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 12√3. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me confirm once more. Because sometimes in hexagons, diagonals can have different lengths. For example, in a regular hexagon, the distance between opposite vertices is 2a (since the diameter of the circumscribed circle is 2a). However, in this case, W and Y are not opposite vertices. Let me check their positions.

Point W is at 120°, Y is at 240°, which is directly opposite to W? Wait, 120° + 180° = 300°, but Y is at 240°, so no. Wait, the opposite of W (at 120°) would be at 120° + 180° = 300°, which is point Z. So W's opposite is Z. Y is at 240°, so its opposite would be 240°+180=60°, which is point V. So WY is not a diameter, but a diagonal spanning two edges.

But according to the coordinates, the distance between W(-6, 6√3) and Y(-6, -6√3) is sqrt[( -6 - (-6))² + ( -6√3 - 6√3 )²] = sqrt[0 + (-12√3)^2] = sqrt[ 144*3 ] = sqrt[432] = 12√3. Yes, that's correct. So the length is 12√3. Hence, answer C.
