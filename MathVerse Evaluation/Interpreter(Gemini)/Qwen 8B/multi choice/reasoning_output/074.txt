MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F. Lines AB and CD are parallel. Line AE intersects CD at point F. There's an angle 1 measuring 115 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 2. 

First, I should visualize the diagram. Since AB is parallel to CD, and AE is a transversal intersecting them at F. That means when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, there are several angle relationships. Like corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, same-side interior angles, etc. 

Given angle 1 is 115 degrees. But where is angle 1 located? The problem mentions angle 1 and angle 2, so maybe they're referring to specific angles formed by the intersection. Let me think. If AE intersects CD at F, then angle 1 could be one of the angles formed at point F. Wait, but angle 1 is mentioned as MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals 115.0. Maybe angle 1 is at point A or somewhere else?

Wait, looking back at the predicates, there's also PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(C,E)) and PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(C,E)). So points C and D lie on line CE. Also, point F lies on line CE. So line CE connects points C, D, and F. Wait, but earlier it says Line(C,D) is parallel to Line(A,B). So line CD is part of line CE? Because points C, D, and F are on line CE. Therefore, line CD is a segment of line CE. And since AB is parallel to CD, which is part of CE. Then line AE intersects CD at F. So AE is crossing CD at F, which is on line CE. 

So, perhaps angle 1 is at point A, between lines AB and AE? Or maybe at point F? Let me try to sketch mentally. Let's consider line AB parallel to line CD. Line AE starts at A and goes through E, intersecting CD at F. So, the transversal AE crosses the parallel lines AB and CD. Wait, AB is parallel to CD, and AE is a transversal. So the angles formed at the intersection points would relate. 

But angle 1 is given as 115 degrees. Let me assume angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the transversal AE with the parallel lines. For example, if angle 1 is at point A, between AB and AE. Then, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, the corresponding angle at point F (where AE meets CD) would be equal to angle 1. But wait, if angle 1 is at A, then the corresponding angle at F would be equal. However, if angle 1 is at F, then it could be supplementary with another angle. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an angle inside the figure. Let me think again. The problem states that angle 1 is 115 degrees. Since AB || CD, and AE intersects CD at F, then at point F, there are vertical angles and other angles. Also, considering triangle AFE or something. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 is the angle at F between AF and FE. Wait, but how do we know where angle 1 is? The problem doesn't specify, but in such problems, usually, angles are labeled based on their position. Since angle 1 is given, and angle 2 is asked, they might be adjacent or supplementary. 

Let me recall that when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle 1 is one of those, then angle 2 could be its supplement. For instance, if angle 1 is on one side of the transversal, then the consecutive interior angle on the other line would add up to 180 degrees. 

Suppose angle 1 is the angle between AB and AE at point A. Then, since AB || CD, the corresponding angle at point F (on CD) would be equal to angle 1. But if angle 1 is 115 degrees, then the corresponding angle at F would also be 115 degrees. But then, if angle 2 is adjacent to that angle at F, forming a straight line, then angle 2 would be 180 - 115 = 65 degrees. Which is option B. Alternatively, if angle 1 is an exterior angle, then maybe angle 2 is an alternate interior angle. 

Wait, let's clarify. If AB is parallel to CD, and AE is a transversal, then the angles formed at A and F would be either corresponding or alternate. Suppose angle 1 is at point A, between AB and AE. Then, the corresponding angle at point F would be between CD and AE. So that angle would be equal to angle 1, hence 115 degrees. Then, if angle 2 is the angle adjacent to that at point F, forming a linear pair, then angle 2 would be 180 - 115 = 65 degrees. So that would make angle 2 equal to 65 degrees, which is option B. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an angle inside the figure, like at point F. Let me check. If AE intersects CD at F, then the angles around point F would include angles formed by AE and CD. If angle 1 is one of those angles, say, between CF and FE, then depending on which angle it is, angle 2 might be different. 

Another possibility: maybe angle 1 is the angle between AE and CD at point F, which is 115 degrees. Then, since AB || CD, the angle between AB and AE at point A would be equal to angle 1 (corresponding angles). But then, if angle 2 is some other angle, perhaps in triangle AFE or something else. 

Wait, maybe angle 2 refers to an angle formed by the intersection of lines. For example, if there's a triangle involved. Let me think about the configuration again. Points C and D are on line CE, and line CD is parallel to AB. So line CE passes through points C, D, F. Line AE intersects CD at F. So line AE starts at A, goes through E, and meets CD at F. 

So, considering triangle AFE, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the sum of the consecutive interior angles would be 180 degrees. If angle 1 is one of these, then angle 2 could be the other. 

Wait, suppose angle 1 is the angle between AB and AE at point A, which is 115 degrees. Then, because AB || CD, the consecutive interior angle at point F (between CD and AE) would be supplementary to angle 1. So that angle would be 180 - 115 = 65 degrees. If angle 2 is that angle, then answer is 65 degrees, which is option B. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is the angle at F between CD and AE, then angle 2 could be another angle in the diagram. But without knowing exactly where angle 2 is, it's hard to tell. However, in standard problems, angle 2 is often the alternate interior angle or something similar. 

Since the options are given, and if angle 2 is the supplementary angle to angle 1, then 180 - 115 = 65 degrees. So option B. 

Therefore, the answer should be B.
