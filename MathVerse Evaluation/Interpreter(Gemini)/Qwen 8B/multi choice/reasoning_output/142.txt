====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F. Lines connecting them: AB, BC, CD, DA form a quadrilateral? Also, there's Line(E,F). Then there are some right angles and perpendiculars mentioned. Let me start by sketching a rough diagram mentally.

Given that AB and CD are vertical telephone poles. Wait, the problem mentions vertical telephone poles AB and CD. But in the predicates, it says LengthOf(A,B) is 6.0 and LengthOf(C,D) is 3.0. So AB and CD are vertical lines, so they're probably aligned vertically? Or maybe they are horizontal? Wait, but telephone poles are usually vertical. Hmm, but the problem says AD intersects BC at point E. So maybe AB and CD are vertical, while AD and BC are other lines intersecting at E.

Also, there are several right angles. For example, Angle(A,B,D) is a right angle, and similarly Angle(C,D,B) is right. That suggests that BD is a common line forming right angles with AB and CD. Since AB and CD are vertical, BD would be horizontal if AB and CD are vertical. Because if AB is vertical and BD is horizontal, then the angle at B between AB and BD is 90 degrees. Similarly for CD and BD.

Additionally, there are perpendicular lines: Line(A,B) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), same with Line(C,D) and Line(B,D). So BD is perpendicular to both AB and CD. Therefore, BD is horizontal if AB and CD are vertical. 

Also, Line(E,F) is perpendicular to BD, so since BD is horizontal, EF is vertical. And since EF is vertical, then E and F are points along this vertical line. Also, there's a mention that EF is part of a right angle at EFB and EFD, meaning that EF is perpendicular to BD, which aligns with being vertical.

Now, the main goal is to find the length from E to the ground EF. Wait, EF is a vertical line segment, so the distance from E to the ground would be the length of EF? Or perhaps the vertical distance from E to the base of the pole? Wait, the problem states "the length of the distance from E to the ground EF". Maybe EF is the vertical segment from E down to the ground, which would be the same as the length of EF?

But let me check the predicates again. There's Triangle(A,B,E) and Triangle(C,D,E). Also, IntersectAt(Line(A,D), Line(B,C), Line(A,D), Point(E)) implies that E is the intersection of AD and BC. So E is where diagonals AD and BC meet.

Since AB and CD are vertical, and BD is horizontal. Let me think about coordinates. Let's assign coordinates to make it easier. Let me set coordinate system with B at origin (0,0). Since AB is vertical and has length 6.0, then A would be at (0,6) because AB goes from B(0,0) up to A(0,6). Similarly, CD is vertical with length 3.0. Now, since BD is horizontal (since AB is vertical and AB ⊥ BD), and B is at (0,0), D must be somewhere along the x-axis. Let me assume D is at (d, 0). Then CD is vertical. Since CD connects to D(d,0), so C would be directly above or below D. Since the length CD is 3.0, assuming direction, let's say upwards, so C is at (d, 3).

Wait, but the problem also mentions that Line(C,D) is connected, so C-D is vertical. Also, the line BD is horizontal from B(0,0) to D(d,0). Now, the line AD connects A(0,6) to D(d,0). The line BC connects B(0,0) to C(d, 3). Their intersection is point E. Let me compute coordinates of E.

Equation of line AD: from (0,6) to (d,0). The slope is (0-6)/(d-0) = -6/d. Equation: y = (-6/d)x + 6.

Equation of line BC: from (0,0) to (d,3). Slope is (3-0)/(d-0) = 3/d. Equation: y = (3/d)x.

Find intersection E: set equations equal:

(-6/d)x + 6 = (3/d)x → 6 = (3/d + 6/d)x → 6 = (9/d)x → x = (6d)/9 = (2d)/3.

Then y = (3/d)*(2d/3) = 2. So E is at ((2d)/3, 2).

Now, EF is a vertical line segment (since EF is perpendicular to BD, which is horizontal). So F lies on EF, which is vertical. From the predicate, Line(E,F) is perpendicular to BD, so it's vertical. Also, F lies on Line(B,D) according to the predicate: PointF lies on Line(B,D). Wait, Line(B,D) is horizontal from (0,0) to (d,0). Wait, but F is on Line(B,D)? Wait, the predicate says "PointLiesOnLine(F,Line(B,D))", so F is on BD. But Line(E,F) is vertical, and F is on BD (horizontal line). So the vertical line EF passes through F on BD. Therefore, EF is vertical, starting at E((2d/3, 2)) going down to F on BD (which is y=0). Wait, but if EF is vertical, then F has the same x-coordinate as E, so x=2d/3, and since F is on BD (y=0), then F is at (2d/3, 0). Thus, the length of EF is the vertical distance from E to F, which is 2 units (since E is at y=2, F at y=0). Wait, but that would mean EF is 2. However, the answer choices don't have 2 as option A. Wait, the options are A:2, B:2.2, C:2.4, D:2.5. Oh, so maybe my assumption about the coordinates is missing something?

Wait, but why did I assume that CD is upward? What if CD is downward? Let me re-examine. Since Line(C,D) is connected, and D is at (d,0). Suppose CD is downward, so C would be at (d,-3). Then line BC connects B(0,0) to C(d,-3). The equation would be y = (-3/d)x. Then intersection with AD (equation y = -6/d x +6) would be:

Set (-6/d)x +6 = (-3/d)x → 6 = (3/d)x → x= 2d. But x=2d would be beyond point D at x=d, which would place E outside the segment BC. But the problem says that AD intersects BC at E, implying that E is the intersection point of the lines AD and BC, even if extended. But then the coordinates of E would be (2d, ...). Wait, that seems problematic. Alternatively, maybe my initial assumption about the direction of CD is wrong. Let me check the right angles again.

We have RightAngle(Angle(C,D,B)). So at point D, the angle between CD and DB is 90 degrees. Since DB is from D to B, which is towards the left if D is at (d,0) and B is at (0,0). So CD is connected to D, and forms a right angle with DB. So CD is perpendicular to DB. Since DB is horizontal (from D to B), then CD must be vertical. Which confirms that CD is vertical. So if D is at (d,0), then CD is vertical. Depending on direction, C could be either up or down. 

Let me suppose that C is above D, making CD upward. Then, as before, the coordinates of C would be (d,3). Then line BC connects B(0,0) to C(d,3), which gives the equation y=(3/d)x. Intersection with AD, which is from A(0,6) to D(d,0): equation y=(-6/d)x +6. Solving gives x= 2d/3, y=2. So E is at (2d/3, 2). Then EF is vertical, passing through E, and F is on BD (the horizontal line from B(0,0) to D(d,0)), so F is at (2d/3, 0). Therefore, the length of EF is 2 units. But answer option A is 2. However, the problem mentions that EF is part of a right angle with B and D, meaning that EF is vertical. Wait, but maybe EF isn't just from E straight down to BD, but maybe there's more to it?

Wait, another predicate says that Line(E,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), which is horizontal. So EF is vertical. Also, there's a Triangle(E,F,B) and Triangle(E,F,D) being right angles. So E-F-B and E-F-D are right angles. Which means that F is the foot of the vertical line from E onto BD. Hence, EF is the vertical distance from E to BD, which is indeed 2 units. But answer choice A is 2, so why is that not the answer? Wait, but the problem says "distance from E to the ground EF". Maybe the ground here refers to the horizontal line BD, which is considered the ground. Then EF is the vertical segment from E to BD, which is 2 units. So answer should be A:2. But wait, looking back at the given answer choices, option A is 2. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me double-check the coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps my coordinate assignment assumes that d is arbitrary, but maybe there's a relation between AB and CD via similarity? The predicate says Similar(Triangle(A,B,E), Triangle(C,D,E)). Let's check that. 

Triangles ABE and CDE are similar. Let's verify that. For triangle ABE and CDE: 

In triangle ABE, sides AB = 6, BE is from B(0,0) to E(2d/3, 2). The length of BE would be sqrt[(2d/3)^2 + 2^2]. In triangle CDE, CD is 3, DE is from D(d,0) to E(2d/3, 2). The length of DE is sqrt[(d - 2d/3)^2 + (0 - 2)^2] = sqrt[(d/3)^2 + 4].

For similarity, ratios of corresponding sides must be equal. Let's see the ratio AB / CD = 6 / 3 = 2. So if the triangles are similar, then AE / CE should also be 2. Let me calculate AE and CE.

AE is from A(0,6) to E(2d/3, 2). The length is sqrt[(2d/3)^2 + (6-2)^2] = sqrt[(4d²/9) + 16]. CE is from C(d,3) to E(2d/3, 2). The difference in x-coordinates: 2d/3 - d = -d/3; y-difference: 2-3=-1. So length CE is sqrt[ (d²/9) + 1 ].

For similarity, AE / CE should equal AB / CD = 2. So:

sqrt( (4d²/9) + 16 ) / sqrt( d²/9 + 1 ) = 2.

Square both sides:

( (4d²/9) + 16 ) / (d²/9 + 1 ) = 4.

Multiply numerator and denominator by 9:

(4d² + 144) / (d² + 9) = 4.

Expand:

4d² + 144 = 4d² + 36 → 144 = 36 → Contradiction! Wait, that can't be. This suggests inconsistency unless my earlier assumption is wrong.

Hmm, that indicates an error in my previous reasoning. Where did I go wrong? 

Ah, maybe the correspondence of the triangles is different. The similarity might be between triangle ABE and CDE, but maybe the order matters. Let me check the angles. Since AB is perpendicular to BD, and CD is perpendicular to BD, then angles at B and D are right angles. So triangles ABE and CDE are both right triangles. Let me check their angles.

In triangle ABE: right angle at B? Wait, original predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,B,D)), which is angle at B between AB and BD. But in triangle ABE, the right angle would be at B if AB is perpendicular to BD. Wait, but BD is horizontal, AB is vertical, so yes, angle at B is right. So triangle ABE is right-angled at B. Similarly, triangle CDE is right-angled at D, since RightAngle(Angle(C,D,B)) — wait, angle at D between CD and DB. So triangle CDE is right-angled at D.

Therefore, the similarity between triangle ABE and CDE must be such that the right angles correspond. So triangle ABE ~ triangle CDE, with right angles at B and D respectively. Therefore, the legs AB and CD correspond. So AB corresponds to CD, and the other legs BE and DE correspond. 

Thus, the ratio of AB/CD = BE/DE = AE/CE. 

From earlier, AB = 6, CD = 3, so ratio is 2. So BE / DE = 2. 

Let me compute BE and DE. 

Earlier, BE was from B(0,0) to E(2d/3, 2). So BE vector is (2d/3, 2). Its length squared is (4d²/9) + 4. 

DE is from D(d,0) to E(2d/3, 2). Vector is (-d/3, 2). Length squared is (d²/9) + 4. 

So BE² / DE² = [(4d²/9 + 4)] / [d²/9 + 4] = [ (4d² + 36)/9 ] / [ (d² + 36)/9 ] = (4d² +36)/(d² +36) = 4*(d²+9)/(d²+36). 

This should equal (AB/CD)^2 = 4. 

So 4*(d²+9)/(d²+36) = 4 → (d²+9)/(d²+36)=1 → d²+9 = d² +36 → 9=36, which is impossible. So contradiction. 

This suggests that my coordinate assumptions are incorrect. Perhaps my initial coordinate assignments are flawed. 

Alternative approach: Since triangles ABE and CDE are similar, and they are right-angled, their sides must be proportional. Let me denote AB = 6, CD = 3. So the ratio of similarity is 2:1. Therefore, the corresponding sides should be in ratio 2:1. 

In triangle ABE, legs AB and BE. In triangle CDE, legs CD and DE. So AB/CD = BE/DE = 2. 

Therefore, BE = 2*DE. 

Let me express BE and DE in terms of coordinates. Earlier, I found that E is at (2d/3, 2). So BE is the distance from B(0,0) to E(2d/3, 2): sqrt[(2d/3)^2 + (2)^2]. DE is distance from D(d,0) to E(2d/3, 2): sqrt[(d - 2d/3)^2 + (0 - 2)^2] = sqrt[(d/3)^2 + 4]. 

Setting BE = 2*DE:

sqrt( (4d²/9) + 4 ) = 2 * sqrt( (d²/9) + 4 )

Square both sides:

(4d²/9 + 4) = 4*(d²/9 + 4)

Multiply out RHS: 4d²/9 + 16

So LHS: 4d²/9 +4 = RHS: 4d²/9 +16 → 4 = 16? No, contradiction again. 

This suggests that my coordinate system assumption is wrong. What's wrong here?

Maybe the triangles aren't similar in the way I thought. Let me check the similarity statement again. The predicate says Similar(Triangle(A,B,E), Triangle(C,D,E)). So triangle ABE similar to triangle CDE. 

But in my coordinate system, these triangles may not be similar. So perhaps my coordinate assignments are incorrect. 

Alternative idea: Since AB || CD (given Parallel(Line(A,B), Line(C,D))), and AB and CD are both vertical, which they are in my coordinate system. So that holds. Also, AB || EF (Parallel(Line(A,B), Line(E,F))). Since AB is vertical, EF is also vertical. So EF is vertical, as previously assumed. 

Another thing: The predicate says that Line(E,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), which is horizontal, so EF is vertical. So EF is vertical. Also, PointF lies on Line(B,D), which is horizontal, so F is on BD. 

So EF is a vertical segment from E down to F on BD. So the length EF is the vertical distance from E to BD, which is the y-coordinate of E. Because BD is horizontal at y=0. Wait, in my previous calculation, E had y-coordinate 2, so EF would be 2. But the problem says that EF is part of a right angle at F. Wait, the right angles at EFB and EFD imply that EF is perpendicular to FB and FD. Since F is on BD, and EF is vertical, FB and FD are segments of BD, which is horizontal. So yes, EF is perpendicular to BD. 

But why does the similarity condition not hold? It must be due to miscalculating the coordinates. Maybe my assumption that AB is vertical and CD is vertical is correct, but the position of D affects the ratio. 

Wait, maybe I need to use the fact that AB || CD and AB || EF, hence EF is parallel to AB and CD, which are vertical, so EF is vertical. Also, since EF is vertical and passes through E, and F is on BD. 

But how to relate this with the similarity? Let me consider vectors or parametric equations.

Let me try a different approach. Let me denote the coordinates again, but without assuming d. Let me assign coordinates with B at (0,0), A at (0,6), D at (a,0), and since CD is vertical, C is at (a, c), with length CD = |c - 0| = |c|. Given that CD length is 3.0, so c = ±3. Let's take c=3 for simplicity. So C is at (a,3). 

Now, line AD connects A(0,6) to D(a,0). Parametric equations:

AD: x = a*t, y = 6 - 6t, where t ∈ [0,1].

Line BC connects B(0,0) to C(a,3). Parametric equations:

BC: x = a*s, y = 3s, s ∈ [0,1].

Intersection E is where these two lines meet. Solve for t and s:

From AD: x = a*t, y = 6 - 6t.

From BC: x = a*s, y = 3s.

So equate x and y:

a*t = a*s → t = s (assuming a ≠ 0).

And 6 - 6t = 3s → 6 - 6t = 3t → 6 = 9t → t = 2/3.

So E is at x = a*(2/3), y = 3*(2/3) = 2. So E is at (2a/3, 2).

Now, EF is vertical line through E, so F is on BD (which is from B(0,0) to D(a,0)), so F has coordinates (x, 0), where x is the same as E's x-coordinate. So F is at (2a/3, 0). Therefore, the length EF is the vertical distance from E(2a/3, 2) to F(2a/3, 0), which is 2 units. So regardless of the value of a, EF is always 2. But this contradicts the similarity condition earlier. Why?

Because the similarity of triangles ABE and CDE requires that the ratio of AB/CD = BE/DE = AE/CE. But according to this, AB=6, CD=3, so ratio 2. Let's calculate BE and DE.

BE is from B(0,0) to E(2a/3, 2). Length squared: (2a/3)^2 + (2)^2 = 4a²/9 + 4.

DE is from D(a,0) to E(2a/3, 2). Length squared: (a - 2a/3)^2 + (0-2)^2 = (a/3)^2 + 4 = a²/9 + 4.

So BE² / DE² = (4a²/9 + 4) / (a²/9 + 4) = [4(a² + 9)/9]/[ (a² + 36)/9 ] = 4(a² +9)/(a² + 36). For this to equal (AB/CD)^2 = 4, we need 4(a²+9)/(a²+36) = 4 → (a²+9)/(a²+36)=1 → a²+9=a²+36 → 9=36, which is false. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that the similarity condition cannot be satisfied under current assumptions. What's wrong here? Did I misinterpret the similarity?

Wait, the predicate says Similar(Triangle(A,B,E), Triangle(C,D,E)). Maybe the similarity is not between AB and CD but between other sides. Let me check the correspondence of vertices. Triangle ABE vs CDE. So vertex A corresponds to C, B to D, E to E? Or another correspondence?

If the similarity is ABE ~ CDE, then the correspondence is A→C, B→D, E→E. But then angle at B (right angle) corresponds to angle at D (right angle). So the legs AB and BE correspond to CD and DE. Hence, AB/CD = BE/DE. As before, leading to the same contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is ABE ~ CED, with different correspondence. Let me try ABE ~ CDE with different vertex order. For example, A→C, B→E, E→D? Not sure. Need to ensure that the right angles correspond. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangles are ABE and CDE with right angles at B and D respectively, so the legs are AB and BE for ABE, and CD and DE for CDE. So similarity ratio AB/CD = BE/DE = AE/CE. 

But in our case, this leads to inconsistency unless a²+9 = a²+36, which is impossible. Hence, there must be an error in my setup. 

Perhaps the issue is that EF is not just the vertical segment from E to BD, but something else? Wait, the predicate says that Line(E,F) is perpendicular to Line(B,D), which is horizontal, so EF is vertical. And F lies on Line(B,D), so F is on BD. Hence, EF is vertical from E to BD, giving length 2. But why is the similarity not holding? 

Wait, maybe the similarity is between triangle ABE and CDE with different side ratios. Let me think differently. Let me use the fact that AB || CD and AB || EF, so EF is parallel to AB and CD. Since AB is vertical, EF is vertical. Also, since AB and CD are both vertical and parallel, and the lines AD and BC intersect at E, creating similar triangles. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and they are cut by transversal AD and BC, creating similar triangles. Wait, maybe using the concept of similar triangles formed by parallel lines. 

Since AB || CD, and they are cut by the transversal BD, which creates certain proportions. Wait, but BD is perpendicular to AB and CD. 

Alternatively, using mass point or coordinate geometry. Let me try to find the value of 'a' that satisfies the similarity condition. Even though earlier attempts led to contradiction, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra.

From the similarity condition: AB/CD = BE/DE = 2. So BE = 2*DE.

From earlier, BE² = 4a²/9 + 4, DE² = a²/9 + 4.

So BE = 2*DE → BE² = 4*DE² → 4a²/9 + 4 = 4*(a²/9 + 4) → 4a²/9 +4 = 4a²/9 + 16 → 4 = 16. Still contradiction. 

This suggests that the similarity condition can't be satisfied with AB || CD and the given lengths. But the problem states that these are given, so there must be an error in my understanding. 

Wait, perhaps the similarity is between triangle ABE and CDE with different correspondence. For instance, maybe triangle ABE ~ triangle DCE? Let me try that. 

If triangle ABE ~ triangle DCE, then AB corresponds to DC, BE corresponds to CE, and AE corresponds to DE. 

AB/DC = BE/CE = AE/DE. 

AB=6, DC=3, so ratio is 2. So BE/CE = 2. 

Compute BE and CE. 

BE is from B(0,0) to E(2a/3, 2): length sqrt( (2a/3)^2 + 2^2 ). 

CE is from C(a,3) to E(2a/3, 2): length sqrt( (a - 2a/3)^2 + (3 - 2)^2 ) = sqrt( (a/3)^2 + 1 ). 

So BE/CE = 2 → sqrt(4a²/9 + 4) / sqrt(a²/9 + 1) = 2. Squaring both sides: (4a²/9 +4)/(a²/9 +1) = 4 → multiply numerator and denominator by 9: (4a² + 36)/(a² + 9) = 4 → 4a² +36 = 4a² +36 → 36=36. Which is true! 

Oh! So the correct correspondence for similarity is triangle ABE ~ triangle DCE, not CDE. This resolves the contradiction. So the similarity is between ABE and DCE, with ratio 2:1. 

Therefore, the earlier mistake was assuming the correspondence of the triangles. So with this corrected, everything works out. 

Now, returning to the main question: the length of EF is the vertical distance from E to BD, which is 2 units. But why isn't this matching the answer choices? Wait, the answer choices include A:2. But let me double-check. 

Wait, in my coordinate system, EF is from E(2a/3, 2) down to F(2a/3, 0), so length is 2. But the problem says "distance from E to the ground EF". Wait, maybe "ground" refers to something else? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem translation. 

Wait, the problem says "the length of the distance from E to the ground EF is ()". Maybe EF is not the vertical segment from E to BD, but another segment? Or perhaps the length of EF is not 2, but something else. 

Wait, let me re-express EF. Since Line(E,F) is perpendicular to BD, and F is on BD. Also, there's a right angle at F: RightAngle(Angle(E,F,B)) and RightAngle(Angle(E,F,D)). This implies that EF is perpendicular to BF and DF. Since BF and DF are parts of BD, which is a straight line, so EF is perpendicular to BD at F. Hence, EF is the altitude from E to BD, and its length is the height from E to BD, which is the y-coordinate of E, which is 2. 

But why is this not matching the answer choices? Let me check the options again. Option A is 2. So why would the answer not be A? Is there a mistake in the problem or in my reasoning? 

Wait, perhaps there's more to the problem. Let me recall the predicates: there's also Triangle(E,F,B) and Triangle(E,F,D) being right-angled. This suggests that F is the foot of the perpendicular from E to BD. Hence, EF is the height, which is 2. So why is this not one of the options? Wait, the options are A:2, B:2.2, C:2.4, D:2.5. So 2 is option A. But maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, the problem might involve finding the length of EF, which is 2, but perhaps the actual calculation involves more steps. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, maybe the length of EF is not simply 2, but needs to be computed using similar triangles. Let me use the similarity between triangles ABE and DCE. 

Since AB=6, CD=3, so ratio is 2:1. Hence, AE/DE = 2. 

Let me compute AE and DE. 

AE is from A(0,6) to E(2a/3, 2). Length: sqrt( (2a/3)^2 + (6-2)^2 ) = sqrt(4a²/9 + 16). 

DE is from D(a,0) to E(2a/3, 2). Length: sqrt( (a - 2a/3)^2 + (0-2)^2 ) = sqrt( a²/9 + 4 ). 

According to similarity, AE/DE = 2 → sqrt(4a²/9 + 16)/sqrt(a²/9 + 4) = 2. Square both sides: (4a²/9 +16)/(a²/9 +4) =4. Multiply numerator and denominator by 9: (4a² + 144)/(a² + 36) =4 → 4a² +144 =4a² +144 → 144=144. True. So this holds for any a. Hence, the length of EF is independent of a, always 2. 

So the answer should be 2, which is option A. But why is this not matching? Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation in the coordinate setup? Let me try with specific numbers. Let me choose a value for a to compute EF. 

Let me set a=3 for simplicity. So D is at (3,0), C is at (3,3). 

Then E is at (2*3/3, 2) = (2,2). So E is at (2,2). F is at (2,0). So EF is from (2,2) to (2,0), length 2. 

Yes, so EF is 2. Hence, the answer is A:2. 

But why is this not among the options? Wait, looking back at the original problem statement, the user says: "the length of the distance from E to the ground EF is ()". Wait, maybe "ground" refers to a different line? Or perhaps "EF" is not the segment from E to F, but something else? 

Wait, the problem says "the length of the distance from E to the ground EF is (...)". Maybe "EF" here is meant to be the length of EF, and the "ground" is referring to the horizontal line BD. In that case, the distance from E to the ground (BD) is indeed the vertical segment EF, which is 2. So answer is A:2. 

But the answer choices include A:2, so it should be correct. But why is this a problem? Maybe the initial problem had a typo, or perhaps I misunderstood the question. 

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the length of EF, which is 2, but there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me check the initial problem statement again: "the length of the distance from E to the ground EF is ()". Maybe "ground" is a mistranslation, and it should refer to the horizontal line BD, and "EF" is a typo. Assuming that, the answer is 2, which is option A. 

Hence, the correct answer is A:2.
