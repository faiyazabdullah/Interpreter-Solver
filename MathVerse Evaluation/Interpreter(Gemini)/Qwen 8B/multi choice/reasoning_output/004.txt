MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have points A, B, C, and O. Lines AB, AO, BC, BO, CO. There's a circle centered at O, and points B and C lie on this circle. Also, Line AB is tangent to the circle at B, so that means AB touches the circle only at B and is perpendicular to the radius OB. Then, extending AO intersects the circle again at point C. So, C is another intersection point of line AO with the circle. We also know that triangle BOC is isosceles because OB and OC are radii of the circle, making them equal in length. Additionally, there's a mention of angle A being 36 degrees, and we need to find angle C, which I assume refers to angle at point C in some triangle, maybe triangle ABC or something else?

Wait, the question says "Connect BC, if angle A = 36.0, then angle C is equal to..." So probably angle at point C in triangle ABC? Or maybe angle at point C in triangle BOC? Let me think.

First, let's note down all the given info:

1. AB is tangent to circle O at B. Therefore, AB ⊥ OB (since radius is perpendicular to tangent at the point of contact). That gives us a right angle at B between AB and OB.

2. Line AO passes through O and extends to intersect the circle again at C. Since O is the center, OC is a radius, so OC = OB. Hence, triangle BOC is isosceles with OB=OC.

3. Given angle A is 36 degrees. Angle A here is likely angle at vertex A in triangle ABC. Wait, but where is point C located? Since C is on line AO, which starts at A and goes through O. So, AO is a line starting at A, passing through O, and then intersecting the circle at C. So, points are ordered as A --- O --- C along line AO. But since O is the center, and C is on the circle, so OC is a radius. So AC is longer than AO, since O is between A and C.

Now, connecting BC forms triangle ABC. Wait, but we need to find angle C. Which angle? In triangle ABC, angle at C would be angle ACB. Alternatively, maybe angle at point C in triangle BOC? The problem statement isn't entirely clear, but given the options, it's more likely referring to angle at C in triangle ABC, since angle A is given. However, let's check.

Alternatively, angle C could refer to angle at point C in triangle BOC. But given that angle A is 36 degrees, which is part of triangle ABC. Let me try to visualize.

Let me sketch mentally. Point A outside the circle, AB tangent to circle at B. Line AO passes through center O and meets the circle again at C. So, OA is a secant line passing through the center. Then, BC connects B to C. Now, angle A is 36 degrees, which is angle between AB and AC? Wait, AB is tangent at B, and AC is the line from A to C. So angle at A is between AB and AC. Then, angle C would be angle at point C in triangle ABC. Let me confirm.

Yes, angle A is given as 36 degrees, so angle BAC is 36 degrees. Need to find angle ACB, which is angle at C in triangle ABC.

But how do we relate this? Let's consider the properties.

Since AB is tangent to the circle at B, and OB is radius, then AB ⊥ OB. Also, since O lies on AO, and C is on the circle, then OC is radius. So OB = OC.

In triangle ABC, we know angle at A is 36 degrees. To find angle at C, perhaps we can use some triangle properties or circle theorems.

Also, since AB is tangent, power of point A with respect to circle O is AB² = AC * AO. Because power of a point states that for a tangent and a secant, the square of the tangent equals the product of the entire secant segment and its external part. Here, AB is tangent, and AC is the secant, but wait, the secant is AO extended to meet the circle at C. Wait, the formula is AB² = AC * AD, where AD is the whole secant. But here, AO is from A to O, then extended to C. Wait, actually, the power of point A should be AB² = AC * AA', where A' is the other intersection. But in this case, the line AO passes through O and intersects the circle at two points: one is B? No, wait, line AO passes through O and intersects the circle at C. Wait, original line AO starts at A, passes through O, and then intersects the circle at C. But O is the center. Wait, unless O is inside the circle? Wait, O is the center of the circle, so the radius is OB and OC. So O is inside the circle? No, O is the center, so the distance from O to B is the radius. Therefore, the line AO starts at A, goes through O (the center), and then exits the circle at C. Therefore, the points along line AO are A----O----C, with O between A and C. Thus, AC = AO + OC. But since OC is the radius, say r, then AO is some length, and AC = AO + r.

Power of point A: AB² = AC * (AO) ? Wait, the power of point A with respect to circle O is AB² = (distance from A to O)^2 - r^2. Wait, power of a point formula is AB² = (AC)(AD), where AC and AD are the lengths from A to the points where a secant passes through the circle. But in this case, the secant is AO passing through O and C. Wait, but O is the center. So the secant passes through A, then O, then C. So the two intersection points are O and C? But O is the center, not necessarily on the circle. Wait, O is the center, so the distance from O to itself is zero, but the line AO passes through O and intersects the circle at C. Wait, so the secant line AO intersects the circle at C and... another point? Wait, but O is inside the circle, so the line AO enters the circle at some point before reaching O. Wait, but according to the given predicates, line AO intersects the circle at point C. Wait, maybe O is not on the circle. Wait, the circle is defined as Circle(O), so O is the center. Therefore, O is not on the circle unless the radius is zero, which it isn't. Therefore, the line AO passes through O and intersects the circle at C. But since O is inside the circle, the line AO would pass through the circle twice: once entering at some point, then exiting at C. Wait, but the problem says "extended line of AO intersects circle O at point C". Maybe the line AO starts at A, passes through O (which is inside the circle), and then continues until it meets the circle again at C. So, points are A---O---C, with O between A and C. Therefore, the power of point A with respect to circle O is AB² = (AC)(AD), where AD is the length from A to the second intersection point. But in this case, the line AO intersects the circle at C and another point. Wait, but the line AO starts at A, goes through O (inside the circle), and then exits the circle at C. Wait, but that would mean that the two intersection points are the entry point and exit point. However, the problem says "extended line of AO intersects circle O at point C". So maybe the line AO intersects the circle only at C? That doesn't make sense unless O is on the circle. Wait, but O is the center, so if O were on the circle, the radius would be zero, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be another intersection point. Wait, maybe there was a typo, and the line AO intersects the circle at C and another point. But the problem says "the extended line of AO intersects circle O at point C", implying that C is the only intersection point? That seems contradictory. Unless the line AO is tangent to the circle at C, but then that would imply that AO is tangent, but we already have AB as tangent. This suggests confusion. Let me re-examine the given predicates.

Looking back: The given predicates include Line(A,O), Line(B,O), Line(C,O), and Circle(O). Also, PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(O)) and PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(O)). So points B and C are on the circle. So line AO passes through O (center) and intersects the circle at point C. Wait, but if O is the center, then line AO passes through O and intersects the circle at two points: one is C, and the other is symmetrically opposite? Wait, but the line AO starts at A, goes through O, and then intersects the circle at C. So C is on line AO beyond O. Therefore, the line AO intersects the circle at C and possibly another point. But the problem states that the extended line of AO intersects the circle at C. So perhaps the line AO intersects the circle at two points, one of which is C. But since O is the center, the line AO passes through O and intersects the circle at two points: one on one side of O, and one on the other. But the problem mentions that the extended line of AO intersects the circle at C. So maybe the line AO starts at A, goes through O, and then intersects the circle at C (on the extension beyond O). Therefore, the two intersection points are C and another point, but the problem specifies that the extended line intersects at C. Maybe the line AO intersects the circle at C and another point, but the problem focuses on C. 

This is getting complicated. Let me focus on the given information and try to find relations.

We know that AB is tangent to the circle at B, so AB ⊥ OB. Also, triangle BOC is isosceles with OB = OC. Also, since O is the center, OB and OC are radii. Also, angle at O in triangle BOC is angle BOC. Since OB and OC are radii, triangle BOC is isosceles with base BC and equal sides OB and OC. 

Given that angle at A is 36 degrees, which is angle BAC. Need to find angle at C, which could be angle ACB. Let's consider triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, we have angle at A = 36 degrees. If we can find other angles or sides, we can compute angle at C.

But how does the circle come into play here? Since AB is tangent, and BC connects B to C on the circle. Also, O lies on line AO, which passes through C. 

Another thought: Since AB is tangent at B, then angle between AB and OB is 90 degrees. So triangle ABO has a right angle at B. Therefore, triangle ABO is right-angled at B. Also, since O is the center, OB is a radius, and OC is also a radius. So OB = OC. 

Moreover, since O lies on line AO, and C is on line AO, then OC is part of line AO. Therefore, points A, O, C are colinear with O between A and C. 

Therefore, AO is a line from A through O to C, with OC being a radius. 

Now, considering triangle ABC. Let's see if we can relate angles. 

In triangle ABO, right-angled at B, we have AB² + BO² = AO². 

Also, since OC is a radius, and O is between A and C, then AC = AO + OC. Let me denote OB = OC = r (radius). Let me assign variables:

Let’s let AB = t, BO = OC = r. Then, from the right triangle ABO, AO² = AB² + BO² → AO = √(t² + r²).

Then, AC = AO + OC = √(t² + r²) + r.

But how does this help us? Perhaps we can use power of point A. Power of point A with respect to circle O is AB² = AC * AD, where AD is the length from A to the second intersection point. Wait, but earlier we said the line AO intersects the circle at C and another point. Let me call the other intersection point D. But the problem says the line AO intersects the circle at C, so maybe D is B? No, B is on the circle, but line AO passes through O and C. Wait, unless B is on line AO? Wait, point B is on the circle, and line AB is tangent at B, so B is not on line AO unless AB coincides with AO, which it doesn't. So line AO passes through O and C, and B is a separate point on the circle. Therefore, the power of point A with respect to circle O is AB² = (AC)(AD), where D is the other intersection point. But since line AO passes through O, which is inside the circle, the power of A would be AB² = AC * AE, where E is the other intersection point. Wait, but in our case, the line AO passes through O and intersects the circle at C and another point. Wait, if O is inside the circle, then the line AO would enter the circle at one point, pass through O, and exit at another. Wait, but since O is the center, the line AO would pass through the circle twice: once on one side of O, once on the other. But since C is on the extension of AO beyond O, then the other intersection point would be on the opposite side of O from A. Let's call that point D. So power of point A is AB² = (AC)(AD). Where AC is the distance from A to C, and AD is from A to D. But since O is between A and C, and assuming that D is on the opposite side of O from A, then AD = AO + OD. But OD is equal to OB (since O is center and D is on the circle), so OD = OB = r. Therefore, AD = AO + r. But AC = AO + OC = AO + r. Wait, but then AC = AD? That would imply that AB² = AC * AD = AC² → AB = AC. Is this possible?

But if AB = AC, then triangle ABC would have AB = AC, making it isosceles with apex at A. But angle at A is 36 degrees, so base angles at B and C would be (180 - 36)/2 = 72 degrees each. But the question asks for angle C, which would be 72 degrees. However, none of the options are 72. The options are 36, 54, 60, 27. Hmm, that suggests my assumption may be wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in applying the power of point. Let me recall the formula correctly. For a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent segment, and also equal to the product of the distances from the point to the two intersection points of any secant line through the point. In this case, the secant line is AO passing through points D and C (where D is the first intersection and C is the second). But since O is between A and C, then the two intersection points are D (closer to A) and C (farther from A). Therefore, power of A is AB² = AD * AC. But we don't know where D is. However, since O is the center, and line AO passes through O, which is inside the circle, then the two intersection points are symmetric with respect to O. Wait, but O is the center, so the distance from O to the circle along AO is the radius. So, if we go from O towards the direction away from A, we reach point C at distance r. Similarly, going from O towards A, we reach the other intersection point D at distance r from O. Therefore, AD = AO - OD = AO - r. And AC = AO + OC = AO + r. So power of A is AB² = AD * AC = (AO - r)(AO + r) = AO² - r². 

But from triangle ABO, which is right-angled at B, we have AB² + BO² = AO² → AB² = AO² - BO². Since BO is the radius, BO = r, so AB² = AO² - r². Comparing with the power of point expression, AB² = AO² - r², which matches. So this confirms consistency. Therefore, this doesn't give us new information directly.

Now, returning to finding angle at C. Let me think about triangle ABC. We know angle at A is 36 degrees. If we can find other sides or angles, we can compute angle at C.

Alternatively, since points B and C are on the circle, and O is the center, perhaps there are some cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles involved. Let's explore.

Since AB is tangent at B, and BC is a chord of the circle. The angle between tangent AB and chord BC is equal to the angle subtended by BC in the alternate segment. This is the Alternate Segment Theorem. According to that theorem, angle between tangent AB and chord BC is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. That is, angle ABC equals angle BOC. Wait, angle ABC is the angle between tangent AB and chord BC, which should be equal to the angle subtended by BC in the alternate segment. The alternate segment would be the arc BC not containing A. But since O is the center, angle BOC is the central angle over arc BC. Therefore, angle ABC = angle BOC / 2? Wait, no. Wait, the Alternate Segment Theorem states that the angle between tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So angle ABC (between tangent AB and chord BC) equals the angle that BC makes with the circumference in the alternate segment. Which would be angle BAC if A is in the alternate segment. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me clarify. The Alternate Segment Theorem says that the angle between the tangent and chord is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. So, in this case, the angle between tangent AB and chord BC is equal to the angle that BC subtends in the alternate segment. The alternate segment would be the arc BC that doesn't contain the tangent point B. Since AB is tangent at B, the alternate segment is the arc BC that's opposite to where the tangent is. So, the angle between AB and BC (angle ABC) is equal to the angle that BC subtends in the alternate segment, which would be angle BAC if A is on that arc. Wait, but point A is outside the circle. Hmm, maybe not. Let me draw this mentally.

Imagine the tangent at B, with AB as the tangent. Chord BC is drawn from B to C on the circle. The angle between AB and BC (angle ABC) is equal to the angle that BC makes with the circumference in the alternate segment. The alternate segment would be the arc BC that's not adjacent to the tangent. Since AB is tangent at B, the alternate segment is the arc BC that's on the opposite side of BC from the tangent. So, the angle ABC equals the angle subtended by BC in that alternate segment. That angle would be the angle subtended at any point on that arc. For example, if there's a point D on that arc, then angle BDC equals angle ABC. However, without knowing where that point is, it's hard to proceed. But perhaps in this case, since we have point A outside, maybe there's a relationship.

Alternatively, since angle ABC equals angle BOC divided by 2? Wait, angle BOC is the central angle over arc BC. The inscribed angle subtended by arc BC would be half of that. But angle ABC is equal to the inscribed angle subtended by arc BC in the alternate segment. So if angle ABC equals angle BAC (if A is on that arc), but A is outside the circle. Not sure.

Alternatively, since angle between tangent AB and chord BC is equal to the angle subtended by BC in the alternate segment. Let's suppose that angle ABC = angle BAC. Wait, but angle BAC is given as 36 degrees. So angle ABC would also be 36 degrees? If that's true, then in triangle ABC, angles at A and B are both 36 degrees, making angle at C equal to 180 - 36 - 36 = 108 degrees. But that's not among the options either. So this suggests my understanding is incorrect.

Wait, maybe angle ABC is equal to angle BOC. Let me think again. The Alternate Segment Theorem says angle between tangent and chord equals the angle in the alternate segment. The angle in the alternate segment would be the angle subtended by BC at any point on the alternate arc. For instance, if we take point O, which is the center. Wait, O is not on the circle. So maybe not helpful. Alternatively, take another point on the alternate arc. Suppose there is a point D on the alternate arc BC such that angle BDC is equal to angle ABC. But without knowing where D is, it's unclear.

Alternatively, since O is the center, angle BOC is the central angle for arc BC. The measure of angle BOC is equal to the measure of arc BC. Also, the inscribed angle subtended by arc BC would be half that. But angle ABC is an angle formed by tangent and chord, which equals the inscribed angle subtended by BC in the alternate segment. So angle ABC = (arc BC)/2. But arc BC is equal to angle BOC. So angle ABC = angle BOC / 2.

But we also have triangle BOC, which is isosceles with OB=OC. So angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote angle OBC = angle OCB = x. Then, angle BOC = 180 - 2x. But angle ABC = angle BOC / 2 = (180 - 2x)/2 = 90 - x.

But angle ABC is also part of triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, we have angle at A = 36 degrees, angle at B = angle ABC = 90 - x, and angle at C = ?

But we need to relate these angles. Let's try to express everything in terms of x.

From triangle BOC: angles at B and C are x each, so angle OBC = x. But angle OBC is part of angle ABC. Wait, angle ABC is the angle between AB and BC. Since AB is tangent at B, and OB is perpendicular to AB. So angle between AB and OB is 90 degrees. Also, angle between OB and BC is angle OBC = x. Therefore, angle between AB and BC (angle ABC) is angle between AB and OB minus angle between OB and BC. Wait, no: AB is tangent at B, so AB is perpendicular to OB. So from point B, the line AB is perpendicular to OB. Then, BC is a line from B to C. So angle between AB and BC is angle ABC, which can be found by subtracting angle between OB and BC from 90 degrees.

Because AB is perpendicular to OB, so angle between AB and OB is 90 degrees. Then, angle between OB and BC is angle OBC = x. Therefore, angle between AB and BC (angle ABC) is 90 - x degrees.

Earlier, we had from Alternate Segment Theorem that angle ABC = angle BOC / 2. And angle BOC = 180 - 2x. So:

angle ABC = (180 - 2x)/2 = 90 - x. Which matches the above. So this is consistent.

Thus, angle ABC = 90 - x. 

Now, in triangle ABC, angles sum to 180 degrees. So:

angle A + angle B + angle C = 180  
=> 36 + (90 - x) + angle C = 180  
=> angle C = 180 - 36 - 90 + x = 54 + x. 

But we need to find angle C. So if we can find x, we can compute angle C.

What is x? x is angle OBC, which is part of triangle BOC, which is isosceles with OB=OC. So angles at B and C are equal. Wait, in triangle BOC, angles at B and C are equal? Wait, OB and OC are equal (radii), so yes, triangle BOC is isosceles with OB=OC, hence angles at B and C are equal. Wait, but angle at O is angle BOC, and angles at B and C are angles OBC and OCB, respectively. So yes, they're equal. So angle OBC = angle OCB = x. 

But what is angle BOC? It's the central angle over arc BC, which is equal to the measure of arc BC. Also, in triangle BOC, angle BOC = 180 - 2x. 

But how can we find x? Let's look for other relations.

From triangle ABO, which is right-angled at B, we have AB² + BO² = AO². Also, from power of point A: AB² = AC * AD. Earlier, we saw that AB² = AO² - r², where r is the radius. But AC = AO + OC = AO + r, and AD = AO - r (since D is the other intersection point on line AO). So AB² = (AO - r)(AO + r) = AO² - r². Which matches the Pythagorean relation from triangle ABO. So again, no new info.

Perhaps we need to consider triangle ABC. We have angle at A = 36, angle at B = 90 - x, angle at C = 54 + x. Also, in triangle ABC, we can relate sides via Law of Sines. 

Law of Sines in triangle ABC:

AB / sin(angle C) = BC / sin(angle A) = AC / sin(angle B)

But we don't know the lengths of AB, BC, or AC. However, we might relate them through the circle properties.

Alternatively, consider triangle BOC. In triangle BOC, sides OB = OC = r, and BC can be found via the Law of Cosines:

BC² = OB² + OC² - 2*OB*OC*cos(angle BOC)  
=> BC² = 2r² - 2r² cos(angle BOC)  
=> BC² = 2r²(1 - cos(angle BOC))  

But angle BOC = 180 - 2x. So,

BC² = 2r²[1 - cos(180 - 2x)]  
cos(180 - 2x) = -cos(2x)  
So BC² = 2r²[1 + cos(2x)]  
Using identity 1 + cos(2x) = 2cos²(x), so  
BC² = 2r² * 2cos²(x) = 4r²cos²(x)  
Thus, BC = 2r cos(x) 

Now, looking back at triangle ABC. Let's consider BC and AB. From the tangent-chord relationship, AB is tangent at B, so AB² = (power of A) = AC * AD. As before, AB² = AC * AD. 

But AC = AO + r, and AD = AO - r. So AB² = (AO + r)(AO - r) = AO² - r². Also, from triangle ABO, AB² = AO² - r². Consistent.

Now, trying to relate BC with other elements. From earlier, BC = 2r cos(x). Also, in triangle ABC, BC is a side. Using Law of Sines:

BC / sin(angle A) = AB / sin(angle C)  
=> BC / sin(36) = AB / sin(angle C)  
But AB² = AO² - r², and BC = 2r cos(x). 

Not sure yet. Let me think differently. What is angle C in triangle ABC? Earlier, we had angle C = 54 + x. Also, in triangle BOC, angles at B and C are x each, so angle OBC = x, and angle OCB = x. 

But angle OCB is part of angle ACB in triangle ABC. Because angle at C in triangle ABC is angle ACB, which includes angle OCB. Wait, point O is on line AO, and point C is on the circle. So line OC is a radius, and angle OCB is part of angle ACB. Let me clarify.

At point C, angle ACB is composed of angle between AC and CB. Line OC is a radius, so OC is from C to O. But angle OCB is the angle between OC and CB. So angle OCB is part of angle ACB. Therefore, angle ACB = angle OCB + angle OCA? Wait, no. Wait, O is on line AO, so line OC is part of line AO. Wait, O is between A and C. So line OC is just the continuation of line AO beyond O to point C. So point O is on line AC. Therefore, at point C, line CB connects to B, and line CO is part of line AC. So angle ACB is the angle between CB and CA. Since O is on AC, the angle between CB and CO is angle OCB, which is x. But angle between CB and CA is angle ACB, which would be angle between CB and CO plus angle between CO and CA? Wait, no. Since O is on AC, line CO is part of AC. So angle at C between CB and CA is simply angle between CB and CO (since CO is same as CA extended). Wait, no. At point C, line CA goes from C to A, and line CB goes from C to B. The angle between them is angle ACB. Since O is on line AC, the line CO is the same as line CA extended beyond C to O. Wait, no. O is between A and C. So from point C, line CO goes back towards O, which is between A and C. So line CO is the reverse of line CA. So at point C, the line CO is going back towards O, which is between A and C. So, at point C, the angle ACB is between line CB and line CA. Since line CO is part of line CA, so angle between CB and CO is angle OCB, which is x. Therefore, angle ACB = x. Wait, that contradicts earlier conclusion that angle C = 54 + x. So there must be an error in previous reasoning.

Wait, previously, I thought angle C = 54 + x, but if angle ACB = x, then that implies 54 + x = x → 54 = 0, which is impossible. So there's a mistake in earlier logic. Let me backtrack.

Earlier, I considered angle ABC = 90 - x, and in triangle ABC, angle C = 54 + x. But if angle ACB is x, then that equation would be invalid. So where did that error occur?

Ah! When I said angle C = 54 + x, that was under the assumption that angle at C is angle ACB, but if angle ACB is x, then that suggests that the previous calculation was wrong. Let me re-express the angles properly.

Let me start fresh. In triangle ABC:

Angle at A = 36 degrees.

Angle at B = angle ABC = 90 - x (from earlier reasoning).

Angle at C = angle ACB = ?

Sum of angles: 36 + (90 - x) + angle C = 180 → angle C = 180 - 36 - 90 + x = 54 + x.

But earlier, I thought angle ACB is x. So if angle C = 54 + x, and angle ACB is x, then 54 + x = x → 54 = 0, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. This indicates an error in assumptions.

Where is the mistake? Let's reevaluate.

Earlier, I stated that angle ABC = 90 - x. How was that derived?

From the Alternate Segment Theorem, angle between tangent AB and chord BC equals the angle in the alternate segment. That angle is equal to angle BAC if A is on the alternate segment. Wait, but A is outside the circle. So perhaps the angle in the alternate segment is not angle BAC but another angle.

Alternatively, the angle between tangent AB and chord BC is equal to the angle subtended by BC in the alternate segment. The alternate segment is the arc BC that does not contain A. So, any point on that arc would form an angle with BC equal to the angle between tangent and chord. For example, if we take point O, which is the center, but it's not on the circle. Alternatively, take a point D on the alternate arc BC. Then, angle BDC = angle between AB and BC.

But since O is the center, and points B and C are on the circle, the central angle BOC is equal to the measure of arc BC. The inscribed angle subtended by arc BC is half of that. So angle BDC = (1/2) arc BC = (1/2) angle BOC.

But angle between AB and BC (angle ABC) is equal to angle BDC. So angle ABC = angle BDC = (1/2) angle BOC.

But angle BOC = 180 - 2x (from triangle BOC). So angle ABC = (180 - 2x)/2 = 90 - x. This part is correct.

So angle ABC = 90 - x.

Now, in triangle ABC, angles are:

A: 36°

B: 90 - x

C: ?

And angle C is what we want. So angle C = 180 - 36 - (90 - x) = 54 + x.

But earlier, I thought angle C = x, but that was incorrect. Why? Because I assumed angle ACB is x, but that's not necessarily true. Let me correct that.

At point C, angle ACB is the angle between CB and CA. Line CA goes from C to A, and line CB goes from C to B. What is this angle? It depends on the position of B and the rest.

But we also have triangle BOC. In triangle BOC, angle at C is angle OCB = x. This angle is part of angle ACB. Because line OC is part of line CA (since O is on line AC). So at point C, line CB forms angle OCB with line OC, which is the same as line CA. So angle OCB is part of angle ACB. Hence, angle ACB = angle OCB + ...? Wait, no. At point C, line OC is part of line CA. So line OC extends from C through O to A. So, at point C, the line CA extends from C through O to A. So, the angle at C between CB and CA is angle ACB, which is the same as angle between CB and CO (since CO is part of CA). Wait, no. If you imagine point C, with line CA going to A (through O), and line CB going to B. The angle between CA and CB at point C is angle ACB. But line CO is the same as line CA extended from C through O to A. So, the angle between CB and CA at point C is angle ACB. And this angle is supplementary to angle between CB and CO? No, because CO is part of CA. So, angle between CB and CA is the same as angle between CB and CO. Wait, no. If you're at point C, line CA goes from C to A, and line CO is the same line as CA, going from C through O to A. So, the angle between CB and CA at point C is the same as the angle between CB and CO. Which is angle OCB, which is x. Wait, that would mean angle ACB = x. But earlier we have angle C = 54 + x. So combining these:

angle C = x = 54 + x → 54 = 0, which is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction, indicating an error in reasoning.

This suggests that my assumption that angle ACB = x is wrong. Where is the mistake?

Wait, in triangle BOC, angle at C is angle OCB, which is x. But angle ACB is not the same as angle OCB. Because at point C, line CB is connected to B, and line CO is part of line CA. So, angle between CB and CO is x, but angle between CB and CA is also x, since CO is part of CA. Wait, that would mean angle ACB = x. But according to the angle sum in triangle ABC, it's 54 + x. So this contradiction suggests a flaw in assumptions.

Let me try to find another way. Let's consider triangle ABC and triangle BOC.

From earlier, angle ABC = 90 - x.

From triangle BOC, angles at B and C are x, so angle OBC = x and angle OCB = x.

Now, at point B, angle between AB and BO is 90 degrees (since AB is tangent at B). Also, angle between BO and BC is x (angle OBC = x). So, angle between AB and BC (angle ABC) is 90 - x, as established.

Now, at point C, angle between BC and CO is x (angle OCB = x). But line CO is part of line CA, so the angle between BC and CA at point C is x. Hence, angle ACB = x.

But from triangle ABC, angle C = x = 54 + x → 54 = 0, which is impossible. Hence, there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps angle ABC is not 90 - x? Let me revisit the Alternate Segment Theorem.

Alternate Segment Theorem: The angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment.

Here, the tangent is AB, and the chord is BC. The angle between AB and BC is angle ABC. The alternate segment is the arc BC not containing A. The angle subtended by BC in this alternate segment would be the angle subtended at any point on that arc. Let's choose point O, but O is the center. The angle subtended by BC at the center is angle BOC. But the angle subtended at the circumference would be half of that, i.e., angle BAC if A is on the alternate arc. But A is outside the circle, so it's not on the arc. Hence, this approach might not work.

Alternatively, let's consider point D on the alternate arc BC. Then, angle BDC = angle ABC. But without knowing where D is, it's difficult.

Alternatively, since O is the center, and points B and C are on the circle, the central angle BOC is equal to the measure of arc BC. The inscribed angle subtended by arc BC would be half of that. But where is this inscribed angle? If there is a point D on the circumference such that it sees arc BC, then angle BDC = ½ angle BOC. But how does this relate to angle ABC?

Alternatively, since AB is tangent at B, and BC is a chord, the angle between AB and BC (angle ABC) is equal to the angle subtended by BC in the alternate segment. If we can find that angle, it would equal angle ABC.

Assume that the alternate segment contains point O. Wait, but O is the center, not on the circle. So perhaps not. Alternatively, consider point A. Wait, A is outside the circle. The angle subtended by BC at A would be angle BAC. But according to the Alternate Segment Theorem, angle ABC = angle BAC. Is that possible?

If angle ABC = angle BAC, then in triangle ABC, angles at A and B are equal, making it isosceles with AC = BC. But angle at A is 36 degrees, so angle at B is 36 degrees, and angle at C is 180 - 36 - 36 = 108 degrees. But this is not among the options. So this suggests that angle ABC ≠ angle BAC.

But why? Maybe the Alternate Segment Theorem applies here. Let me verify.

According to the Alternate Segment Theorem, the angle between the tangent and the chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So angle ABC = angle BAC. If that's true, then angle ABC = 36 degrees, leading to angle at C = 180 - 36 - 36 = 108, which isn't an option. So this suggests that either the theorem doesn't apply here, or my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the angle in the alternate segment is not angle BAC but another angle. Let me think. The alternate segment is the arc BC that doesn't contain A. So if I take a point on that arc, say, point D, then angle BDC = angle ABC. If point D is chosen such that it's on the arc BC opposite to A, then angle BDC = angle ABC. But how to relate this to other parts of the diagram?

Alternatively, since O is the center, and points B and C are on the circle, perhaps the angle BOC is related to angle BDC. But without knowing where D is, it's challenging.

Maybe I need to find another approach. Let's consider triangle ABC and triangle BOC.

From earlier, in triangle BOC, OB = OC = r, and angle BOC = 180 - 2x. Also, angle ABC = 90 - x.

In triangle ABC, angle at B is 90 - x, angle at A is 36 degrees, so angle at C is 54 + x.

Now, let's consider triangle ABC and triangle BOC. Can we relate them?

Let me use Law of Sines in both triangles.

In triangle ABC: 
AB / sin(angle C) = BC / sin(angle A) = AC / sin(angle B)

In triangle BOC:
BC / sin(angle BOC) = OB / sin(angle OCB) = OC / sin(angle OBC)

Since OB = OC = r, and angles at B and C are x, angle BOC = 180 - 2x.

So, in triangle BOC:
BC / sin(angle BOC) = OB / sin(x)  
=> BC = OB * sin(angle BOC) / sin(x)  
=> BC = r * sin(180 - 2x) / sin(x)  
sin(180 - 2x) = sin(2x)  
So, BC = r * sin(2x) / sin(x) = r * 2cos(x) 

Thus, BC = 2r cos(x)

Now, in triangle ABC, using Law of Sines:

BC / sin(36) = AB / sin(angle C)  
=> 2r cos(x) / sin(36) = AB / sin(54 + x)  
But from the right triangle ABO, AB² + r² = AO². Also, from power of point, AB² = AC * AD. But AC = AO + r, AD = AO - r. So AB² = (AO + r)(AO - r) = AO² - r². Hence, AB = sqrt(AO² - r²). But without knowing AO, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, let's express AB in terms of r and x. Let's see if we can find a relation.

From triangle ABC, angle at C is 54 + x, and angle at B is 90 - x. So let's write the ratio of BC to AB.

From Law of Sines:

BC / AB = sin(36) / sin(54 + x)  
But BC = 2r cos(x), and AB can be expressed from the right triangle ABO. In triangle ABO, which is right-angled at B, AB = sqrt(AO² - r²). But AO is the distance from A to O, and AC = AO + r. 

But we need to relate AO with r. Let's consider the line AO, which passes through O and C. Since OC = r, and O is between A and C, then AC = AO + OC = AO + r. 

But how to relate AO with r? Perhaps using the fact that AB is tangent to the circle at B, and AB² = AC * AD, where AD is the length from A to the other intersection point D. But earlier, we determined that AD = AO - r, and AC = AO + r. So AB² = (AO + r)(AO - r) = AO² - r². 

But from triangle ABO, AB² = AO² - r², which matches. So this doesn't provide new information.

But perhaps we can relate AB with BC. From earlier, BC = 2r cos(x), and AB = sqrt(AO² - r²). But without knowing AO, this is still stuck.

Wait, but maybe we can express AO in terms of r and x. Let's consider triangle ABC. From Law of Sines:

AB / sin(angle C) = BC / sin(angle A)  
=> AB / sin(54 + x) = BC / sin(36)  
=> AB = BC * sin(54 + x) / sin(36)  
Substitute BC = 2r cos(x):  
AB = 2r cos(x) * sin(54 + x) / sin(36)  

But from triangle ABO, AB² = AO² - r². Also, from the power of point, AB² = AC * AD = (AO + r)(AO - r) = AO² - r². So this is consistent, but again, no new info.

Let me try to combine these expressions. Let's set AB from the Law of Sines equal to AB from the right triangle.

From Law of Sines: AB = 2r cos(x) * sin(54 + x) / sin(36)  
From right triangle: AB = sqrt(AO² - r²)  

But this still leaves AO as an unknown. However, perhaps there's a way to relate AO with r and x.

Alternatively, let's consider triangle ABC and triangle BOC. Let me try to find x.

From earlier, in triangle ABC, angle C = 54 + x. Also, in triangle BOC, angle BOC = 180 - 2x. 

But angle BOC is also related to the circle. Since B and C are on the circle, and O is the center, angle BOC is the central angle over arc BC, so it's equal to the measure of arc BC. 

Additionally, in triangle ABC, angle at A is 36 degrees, which is the angle between AB and AC. But AB is tangent at B, and AC is a secant. 

Wait, maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC. Let's try that.

In triangle ABC, using Law of Cosines:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2 * AB * AC * cos(angle A)  
But this seems complex without knowing the lengths.

Alternatively, let's consider that angle BAC = 36 degrees, and AB is tangent at B. So, using the tangent-secant angle relationship. 

The angle between tangent AB and secant AC is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. Specifically, angle BAC = (measure of arc BC - measure of arc BD)/2, where BD is the arc opposite. But since AB is tangent at B, and AC is a secant passing through C, the angle between them is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

The intercepted arcs are the arc BC (which is the arc between B and C not containing A) and the arc BD, but since A is outside, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

Wait, the formula is: the angle between a tangent and a secant is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. In this case, the angle at A is between tangent AB and secant AC, which intercepts arc BC and the arc from B to C passing through the opposite side. Since AB is tangent at B, and AC passes through C, the angle at A is equal to (arc BC - arc BD)/2, where BD is the arc from B to D, but this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, since AB is tangent at B, and AC is a secant passing through C, the angle between AB and AC is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are arc BC (the arc between B and C that doesn't contain A) and the arc that is opposite, but since A is outside, it's just the arc BC. Wait, the formula is: angle between tangent and secant is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the points of intersection of the secant and the circle, and the arc between the tangent point and the other intersection. Wait, in this case, the secant is AC, which passes through C and goes to A. But since A is outside, the secant passes through C and extends to A. The intercepted arcs are the arc from B to C (since AB is tangent at B) and the arc from B to C that's on the other side. Wait, this is confusing.

Actually, the formula states that the angle between a tangent and a secant is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant intersects the circle (here, just point C, since the secant is AC, which intersects the circle at C and possibly another point. Wait, earlier we said that line AO intersects the circle at C and another point D. But in this case, the secant is AC, which passes through C and goes to A. The intercepted arcs would be the arc from B to C (since the tangent is at B) and the arc from B to the other intersection point. But since the secant is AC, which passes through C and goes to A, the other intersection is D. So the angle at A is equal to half the difference of the arcs BD and BC. But I'm not sure.

This is getting too tangled. Let me try to use the earlier relation from the Law of Sines and try to find x.

From earlier, in triangle ABC, angle C = 54 + x, and angle at B is 90 - x. Also, in triangle BOC, angle BOC = 180 - 2x.

But angle BOC is also the central angle over arc BC, so it's equal to the measure of arc BC. Let's denote arc BC as y. So y = 180 - 2x.

Now, in triangle ABC, angle at A is 36 degrees, which is the angle between tangent AB and secant AC. According to the tangent-secant angle theorem, this angle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are arc BC (y) and the arc that is opposite, which would be the arc from B to C passing through the other side of the circle. But since the tangent is at B, and the secant passes through C, the angle at A is equal to (arc BC - arc BD)/2, where BD is the arc from B to D, but this is unclear.

Alternatively, since AB is tangent at B, and AC is a secant passing through C, the angle between AB and AC is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc BC (the arc between B and C) and the arc that is opposite, which would be the arc from B to C passing through the other side of the circle. But since the tangent is at B, the angle at A is equal to half the difference between the arc BC and the arc that is opposite. 

However, since the tangent is at B, and the secant passes through C, the angle at A is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc BC (which is y) and the arc that is opposite, which would be the arc from B to C passing through the side opposite to A. But since the circle is 360 degrees, the total circumference is 360, and the arc BC is y, so the opposite arc would be 360 - y. But the angle at A is half the difference between these two arcs: (360 - y - y)/2 = (360 - 2y)/2 = 180 - y. But this is supposed to equal angle at A, which is 36 degrees. So:

180 - y = 36  
=> y = 144 degrees.

But y is the measure of arc BC, which is equal to angle BOC, which is 180 - 2x. So:

180 - 2x = 144  
=> 2x = 36  
=> x = 18 degrees.

Now, x = 18 degrees.

Now, recall that in triangle ABC, angle at C is 54 + x = 54 + 18 = 72 degrees. But this is not one of the options. Wait, but let me check if this is correct.

Wait, if arc BC is 144 degrees, then angle BOC = 144 degrees, which is equal to 180 - 2x => 180 - 2x = 144 => x = 18 degrees. Then, in triangle ABC, angle at C is 54 + x = 72 degrees. But the options are 36, 54, 60, 27. 72 is not an option. This suggests a mistake.

Wait, but where is the mistake here? Let me review.

The angle at A is 36 degrees, which is the angle between tangent AB and secant AC. According to the tangent-secant angle theorem, this angle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc BC (the arc between B and C that is opposite to the angle) and the arc that is on the other side. But since the tangent is at B, the angle at A is half the difference between the arc BC (not containing A) and the arc BC containing A. Wait, no. The formula is: the angle between a tangent and a secant is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc between the points where the secant intersects the circle (here, just point C, since the secant is AC, which intersects the circle at C and possibly another point D. But if the secant is AC, which starts at A, passes through C, and extends to the circle. Wait, but earlier, we said that line AO intersects the circle at C and another point D. So the secant is AD, passing through C and D. But the angle at A is between tangent AB and secant AD, which would intercept arc BD. But this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the angle between tangent AB and secant AC is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arc from B to C (not containing A) and the arc from B to the other intersection point. But since the secant AC passes through C and extends to D, the other intersection point, the angle at A is half the difference of arc BC and arc BD. But without knowing where D is, it's hard to calculate.

However, earlier calculation gave us arc BC = 144 degrees, leading to x = 18 degrees, and angle at C = 72 degrees. But this is not an option. So where is the mistake?

Wait, let's double-check the tangent-secant angle theorem. The angle between a tangent and a secant is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The angle is equal to (larger arc - smaller arc)/2. In this case, the angle at A is between tangent AB and secant AC. The intercepted arcs are the arc from B to C (which is the arc BC) and the arc from B to the point where the secant meets the circle again. Wait, but the secant AC passes through C and extends to D (the other intersection point). So the intercepted arcs are arc BC and arc BD. But since A is outside, the angle at A is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Assuming that the larger arc is BD and the smaller arc is BC, then angle at A = (BD - BC)/2.

But without knowing where D is, it's hard to calculate. However, if we assume that the secant AC passes through C and D, and since O is on line AC, then D is the other intersection point on line AO, which is on the opposite side of O from A. Let's call that point D. So the secant is AD, passing through C and D. The intercepted arcs are arc BD and arc BC. But this requires knowing the position of D.

Alternatively, since O is the center, and line AO passes through O and C, and D is the other intersection point on line AO. So, if we consider the secant AD, which passes through D and C, and the tangent AB at B. The angle between AB and AD is angle BAD, which is the same as angle BAC since C is on line AO. So, angle BAD = 36 degrees. According to the tangent-secant theorem, this angle is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are arc BD and arc BC. So:

36 = (arc BD - arc BC)/2  
=> arc BD - arc BC = 72 degrees.

But arc BD is the arc from B to D, and arc BC is from B to C. Since D is on line AO, which passes through O, and C is on the circle. Let's assume that D is on the opposite side of O from A. So, the arc BD would pass through C and D, depending on the position.

But this is getting too abstract. Let's try to relate arc BC and arc BD.

Since O is the center, and points B and C are on the circle, and D is another point on line AO. Let's assume that arc BC is y, and arc BD is z. Then, y - z = 72 degrees. But without more information, it's difficult to proceed.

However, earlier, we had from the alternate segment theorem and the angle at A being 36 degrees, leading to arc BC = 144 degrees. If that is correct, then arc BC = 144 degrees, and angle BOC = 144 degrees, leading to x = 18 degrees, and angle at C = 54 + x = 72 degrees. Since this is not an option, there must be a mistake in this approach.

Let me try another approach. Let's assume that angle C is 54 degrees, which is option B. Let's see if that works.

If angle C = 54 degrees, then in triangle ABC, angles are:

A: 36°, C: 54°, so angle B = 180 - 36 - 54 = 90 degrees.

So angle at B is 90 degrees. But earlier, we had angle ABC = 90 - x. So 90 - x = 90 → x = 0, which is impossible. So this is invalid.

Next, option C is 60 degrees. If angle C = 60°, then angle B = 180 - 36 - 60 = 84°. So angle ABC = 84° = 90 - x → x = 6°. Then, in triangle BOC, angle BOC = 180 - 2x = 180 - 12 = 168 degrees. Then, arc BC = 168 degrees. Using the tangent-secant theorem, angle at A = (arc BC - arc BD)/2. If arc BC is 168, and angle at A is 36, then 36 = (168 - arc BD)/2 → 72 = 168 - arc BD → arc BD = 96 degrees. This is possible, but it doesn't help us directly.

Option D is 27 degrees. If angle C = 27°, then angle B = 180 - 36 - 27 = 117°. So angle ABC = 117° = 90 - x → x = -27°, which is impossible.

Option A is 36°. If angle C = 36°, then angle B = 180 - 36 - 36 = 108°. So angle ABC = 108° = 90 - x → x = -18°, which is impossible.

None of these options seem to fit, suggesting that there's a fundamental error in the approach. Let me reconsider.

Perhaps the angle at C is not 54 + x, but something else. Let me revisit the earlier step where I said angle C = 54 + x. 

In triangle ABC, angle C is 54 + x. But if x is 18 degrees, then angle C is 72 degrees. Since this is not an option, but the closest option is 54 (option B), perhaps there's a miscalculation in relating x.

Wait, let's go back to the tangent-secant angle theorem. If angle at A is 36 degrees, and it's equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Assume that the intercepted arcs are arc BC and arc BD, where D is the other intersection point on line AO. Let's say arc BC = y, and arc BD = z. Then:

36 = (z - y)/2 → z - y = 72.

But since the total circumference is 360 degrees, and arc BC + arc CD + arc DB = 360. But this is too many variables.

Alternatively, if the secant passes through C and D, and the tangent is at B, then the angle at A is half the difference of the arcs BD and BC. If we assume that arc BD is the major arc, and arc BC is the minor arc.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult. However, if we assume that arc BC is 144 degrees (as previously), then arc BD would be 144 + 72 = 216 degrees. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, if arc BC is 144 degrees, then the central angle BOC is 144 degrees, and in triangle BOC, angles at B and C are x, so 180 - 2x = 144 → x = 18 degrees. Then, angle at C in triangle ABC is 54 + x = 72 degrees. But since this is not an option, perhaps the question refers to a different angle.

Wait, the question says "connect BC, if angle A = 36.0, then angle C is equal to ()". Maybe angle C refers to angle OCB, which is x = 18 degrees. But 18 is not an option. Or maybe angle OCB is part of angle C in triangle ABC, which is 72 degrees, and there's a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to angle OCB, which is x = 18 degrees. But this is not an option. Or maybe it refers to angle OBC, which is also x = 18 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at C in triangle BOC is x, and in triangle ABC, angle at C is x. But this led to contradictions. 

Given the time spent and lack of progress, perhaps the correct answer is 54 degrees, which is option B. Let me see why.

If angle at C is 54 degrees, then in triangle ABC, angle B = 180 - 36 - 54 = 90 degrees. So angle at B is 90 degrees. But earlier, we had angle ABC = 90 - x. So 90 - x = 90 → x = 0, which is impossible. But if we ignore this and assume that angle at C is 54, then it might be the intended answer.

Alternatively, let's consider that angle at C is 54 degrees, and this is due to some property. For example, if triangle BOC is isosceles with angle at O being 180 - 2x, and if x = 18, then angle BOC = 144, and if angle at C in triangle ABC is 54, then it might relate to some other property.

But I'm stuck. Given the options and the earlier calculation where angle C = 72 degrees, which is close to 54, but not matching, and considering that in some cases, errors in calculation can lead to near values, perhaps the intended answer is 54 degrees (option B), assuming that angle C is 54 degrees, even though the derivation shows 72. This might be due to miscalculations in the process.

Alternatively, let's consider that angle at C is 54 degrees, and this comes from the isosceles triangle BOC. If angle BOC is 108 degrees, then x = (180 - 108)/2 = 36 degrees. Then, angle at C in triangle ABC would be 54 + x = 54 + 36 = 90 degrees, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle BOC is 72 degrees, then x = (180 - 72)/2 = 54 degrees. Then, angle at C in triangle ABC is 54 + x = 54 + 54 = 108, which is not an option.

I'm running out of ideas. Given that the options are 36, 54, 60, 27, and the only plausible calculation giving a value close to 54 is if x = 18, leading to angle C = 72, which is not an option, but if there's a miscalculation, maybe the correct answer is 54 degrees (option B). Or perhaps the angle at C is 54 degrees, and the earlier steps had an error.

Alternatively, let's consider that in triangle BOC, since it's isosceles with OB = OC, and angle BOC = 180 - 2x, and if angle BOC is 108 degrees, then x = (180 - 108)/2 = 36 degrees. Then, angle ABC = 90 - x = 54 degrees. In triangle ABC, angle at A is 36, angle at B is 54, so angle at C is 180 - 36 - 54 = 90 degrees. Still not matching.

Wait, if angle ABC is 54 degrees, then angle at C is 90 degrees. But this is not an option.

Alternatively, if angle at B is 36 degrees, then angle at C is 180 - 36 - 36 = 108. Not an option.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the only plausible value from the calculation is 72 degrees, which is not an option, but since the options are limited, and the closest is 54, perhaps the correct answer is B: 54 degrees. This might be due to a miscalculation in the steps, but given the options, this is the best guess.
