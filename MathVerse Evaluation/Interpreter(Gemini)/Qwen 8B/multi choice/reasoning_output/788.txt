Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the relationships between the points and triangles mentioned. 

So, we have two triangles: ABC and BDE. The problem states that BE is on AB. That means point E lies somewhere along the line segment AB. Also, there are some angle congruences: angle A is congruent to angle BED, and angle C is congruent to angle D. Additionally, the ratio of AB to EB is 5:1, and the area of triangle BDE is given as 5a² + 10. We need to find the area of triangle ABC.

Let me start by recalling the given predicates. The main ones are about similarity between triangles ABC and BDE, since they mention Similar(Triangle(A,B,C),Triangle(B,E,D)). Also, the RatioOf(LengthOf(A,B),LengthOf(E,B),5,1) tells us that AB is five times EB. So if AB = 5x, then EB = x. But since BE is part of AB, maybe AB is split into segments AE and EB? Wait, but the problem says BE is on AB, so perhaps E is between A and B? Or could it be extended beyond? Hmm, but usually, unless specified otherwise, such statements imply that the points are colinear in the order mentioned. So maybe A---E---B, making BE a part of AB. Wait, but the Line(A,B) exists, and Point E lies on Line(A,B). Wait, the predicate PointLiesOnLine(E,Line(A,B)) confirms that E is on line AB. So E is somewhere on line AB. Since BE is one of the sides of triangle BDE, which includes points B, D, E. So D is another point connected to B and E. Also, Triangle(B,D,E) has sides BD, DE, and BE.

Now, the similarity between triangles ABC and BDE. Let's note that. If two triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are congruent, and their sides are proportional. Given that angle A is congruent to angle BED, and angle C is congruent to angle D. Let me try to map the angles. In triangle ABC, angles are at A, B, C. In triangle BDE, angles are at B, D, E. The given congruences are angle A ≅ angle BED (which would correspond to angle at A in ABC and angle at E in BDE?), and angle C ≅ angle D (angle at C in ABC corresponds to angle at D in BDE). Wait, but angle C is in triangle ABC, and angle D is in triangle BDE. So maybe the correspondence is ABC ~ BDE, with angle A corresponding to angle B? No, because angle A is congruent to angle BED. Wait, angle BED is at point E in triangle BDE. Let me clarify the correspondence.

Let me think: For similar triangles, the order matters. So if Triangle ABC ~ Triangle BDE, then angle A corresponds to angle B, angle B to angle D, angle C to angle E? Wait, but the given congruence is angle A ≅ angle BED. Angle BED is at point E in triangle BDE. So angle at E in BDE corresponds to angle A in ABC. Similarly, angle C in ABC corresponds to angle D in BDE. Therefore, the correspondence would be ABC ~ EBD? Because angle A corresponds to angle E, angle B corresponds to angle B, angle C corresponds to angle D. Wait, but that may not hold. Alternatively, maybe the similarity is ABC ~ BDE with different vertex orderings. Let me check again.

Given that angle A ≅ angle BED (so angle A is in ABC, angle BED is at E in BDE). So angle A corresponds to angle E in BDE. Then angle C ≅ angle D (angle C in ABC corresponds to angle D in BDE). Therefore, the similarity would be ABC ~ EDB? Let me think about the order. For similarity, the order of vertices determines the correspondence. So if angle A corresponds to angle E, angle B corresponds to angle D, and angle C corresponds to angle B? Wait, maybe not. Let me try to write down the correspondence properly.

Suppose triangle ABC ~ triangle BDE. Then the angles would correspond as follows: angle A corresponds to angle B, angle B to angle D, angle C to angle E. But according to the given congruences, angle A ≅ angle BED (which is angle E in triangle BDE). So that would mean angle A corresponds to angle E in BDE. Therefore, the similarity should be ABC ~ EBD? Let me check that. If ABC ~ EBD, then angle A corresponds to angle E, angle B to angle B, angle C to angle D. That fits the given congruences. So the correspondence is ABC ~ EBD, with angle A ↔ angle E, angle B ↔ angle B, angle C ↔ angle D. Wait, but angle B in ABC is at point B, and angle B in BDE is also at point B? Wait, triangle BDE has vertices B, D, E. So angle at B is angle DBE. But angle B in triangle ABC is angle ABC. Are these angles congruent? Well, if the similarity is ABC ~ EBD, then angle B in ABC corresponds to angle B in EBD. However, in triangle EBD, angle at B is angle EBD. So angle ABC (from ABC) corresponds to angle EBD (from EBD). But the problem doesn't state that these angles are congruent directly; instead, it gives angle A ≅ angle BED and angle C ≅ angle D. So perhaps the similarity is ABC ~ EBD, with angle A (ABC) corresponding to angle E (EBD), angle B (ABC) corresponding to angle B (EBD), and angle C (ABC) corresponding to angle D (EBD). 

But wait, if that's the case, then the similarity ratio would be based on the sides opposite those angles. For example, side BC in ABC corresponds to side ED in EBD. Side AB in ABC corresponds to side EB in EBD. And side AC corresponds to side BD. 

Alternatively, since the ratio of AB to EB is given as 5:1, and if AB corresponds to EB in the similar triangles, then the scale factor would be AB / EB = 5/1. Therefore, the ratio of similarity between ABC and EBD is 5:1. 

Wait, but if ABC is similar to EBD, then the ratio of their corresponding sides would be the same. So if AB corresponds to EB, then AB/EB = ratio of similarity. Which is given as 5:1. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 5:1. So the area ratio would be the square of that, so 25:1. Thus, area of ABC would be 25 times area of EBD. Since the area of EBD is given as 5a² + 10, multiplying by 25 would give 25*(5a² +10)=125a²+250. Looking at the answer choices, that's option D. But let me verify this carefully.

Wait, but first, is the similarity ratio indeed AB/EB=5? Let's make sure that AB corresponds to EB. If the similarity is ABC ~ EBD, then AB corresponds to EB. Because angle A corresponds to angle E, angle B corresponds to angle B, angle C corresponds to angle D. So the sides opposite those angles would be BC opposite angle A in ABC, and ED opposite angle E in EBD. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me recall that in similar triangles, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal. So if angle A corresponds to angle E, then side BC (opposite angle A) corresponds to side ED (opposite angle E). Similarly, side AB (opposite angle C) corresponds to side BD (opposite angle D). And side AC (opposite angle B) corresponds to side EB (opposite angle B). Wait, angle B in ABC is at point B, and angle B in EBD is also at point B. So the side opposite angle B in ABC is AC, and the side opposite angle B in EBD is ED? Wait, no. In triangle EBD, the angles are at E, B, D. The side opposite angle E is BD, the side opposite angle B is ED, and the side opposite angle D is EB. 

So if angle A in ABC corresponds to angle E in EBD, then the side opposite angle A (BC) corresponds to the side opposite angle E (BD). Similarly, angle B in ABC corresponds to angle B in EBD, so the side opposite angle B in ABC (AC) corresponds to the side opposite angle B in EBD (ED). And angle C in ABC corresponds to angle D in EBD, so the side opposite angle C (AB) corresponds to the side opposite angle D (EB). 

Therefore, AB in ABC corresponds to EB in EBD. Hence, AB/EB = ratio of similarity. Which is given as 5:1. Therefore, the ratio of similarity between ABC and EBD is 5:1. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is 5² : 1² = 25:1. Therefore, Area of ABC = 25 × Area of EBD. 

Since the area of EBD is given as 5a² + 10, then Area of ABC would be 25*(5a² +10) = 125a² + 250. Looking at the options, that's option D. 

But wait, let me check if the similarity ratio is indeed AB/EB. Suppose the correspondence is ABC ~ EBD. Then AB corresponds to EB. So yes, AB/EB = 5. Hence, the area ratio is 25. 

But wait, another way to think: if the ratio of AB to EB is 5:1, then the similarity ratio is 5:1. So area ratio is 25:1. So area ABC is 25 times area BDE. Given that area of BDE is 5a² +10, multiply by 25 gives 125a² + 250, which is option D. 

But let me check if there's any mistake in the correspondence. What if the similarity is different? For example, if triangle ABC ~ triangle BDE, then the ratio would be AB/BF or something else. Wait, but how do we know which sides correspond? The key is the angle congruences. 

We have angle A ≅ angle BED. Angle A is in triangle ABC. Angle BED is angle at E in triangle BDE. So angle A corresponds to angle E in BDE. Then angle C ≅ angle D. Angle C is in ABC, angle D is in BDE. So angle C corresponds to angle D in BDE. Therefore, the correspondence is ABC ~ EBD. Therefore, the sides opposite these angles would be BC (opposite A) corresponds to BD (opposite E), AB (opposite C) corresponds to ED (opposite D), and AC (opposite B) corresponds to EB (opposite B). Wait, but angle B in ABC corresponds to angle B in BDE? Wait, angle B in ABC is at point B, and angle B in BDE is at point B. So that suggests that angle B in ABC corresponds to angle B in BDE. Therefore, the side opposite angle B in ABC is AC, and the side opposite angle B in BDE is ED. So AC corresponds to ED. 

But the given ratio is AB/EB = 5:1. AB is a side in ABC, and EB is a side in BDE. If AB corresponds to EB, then the ratio is AB/EB = 5. Therefore, similarity ratio is 5:1, leading to area ratio 25:1. 

Thus, the area of ABC is 25 times the area of BDE. Since area of BDE is 5a² +10, then area of ABC is 25*(5a² +10) = 125a² +250. So answer is D. 

I don't see any errors in this logic. All the given angle congruences support the similarity of ABC ~ EBD with the ratio 5:1. Therefore, the area calculation is correct.
