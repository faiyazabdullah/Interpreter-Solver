====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have point P outside a circle O. PA and PB are tangents to the circle, making them tangent lines. The angle APB is 120 degrees, and the radius of the circle is 10 units. We need to find the length of chord AB.

First, I'll recall some properties about tangents and circles. When two tangents are drawn from an external point to a circle, they are equal in length. So PA equals PB. Also, the line from the external point to the center of the circle bisects the angle between the two tangents. Wait, but here we have angle APB given as 120 degrees. Maybe I can use some triangle properties here.

Since PA and PB are tangents, and O is the center of the circle, then OA and OB are radii perpendicular to the tangents at points A and B respectively. That means angles OAP and OBP are right angles. So triangles OAP and OBP are right-angled at A and B.

So, quadrilateral OAPB has two right angles at A and B. Also, since OA and OB are radii, they are equal in length, both being 10 units. Therefore, triangles OAP and OBP are congruent by hypotenuse-leg (HL) theorem because OA=OB, AP=BP, and both are right triangles. Hence, OP is the common side, but maybe more importantly, angles OPA and OPB are equal. Since angle APB is 120 degrees, each of those angles would be half of that? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the entire angle at P is 120 degrees. Since the two triangles OAP and OBP are congruent, the angles at P in each triangle should be equal. Let me denote angle OPA as θ. Then angle APB is 2θ. But angle APB is given as 120°, so θ is 60°. So in triangle OAP, which is right-angled at A, angle at P is 60°, so the remaining angle at O would be 30°, since angles sum to 180°. 

But wait, triangle OAP: right-angled at A, so angle at A is 90°, angle at P is 60°, so angle at O is 30°. Similarly for triangle OBP. Therefore, angle AOP is 30°, same as angle BOP. So the total angle AOB would be angle AOP + angle BOP = 30° + 30° = 60°, but wait, that seems off. Wait, O is the center, so OA and OB are radii, and AB is a chord. The angle AOB is the central angle corresponding to chord AB. So if angle AOB is 60°, then the length of AB can be found using the formula for chord length: AB = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Here, r is 10, θ is 60°, so AB = 2*10*sin(30°). Sin(30°) is 0.5, so AB = 2*10*0.5 = 10. So AB would be 10 units. But looking at the options, B is 10. However, wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider triangle APB. Since PA and PB are equal, triangle APB is isoceles with PA=PB, and angle at P is 120°. Using the Law of Cosines on triangle APB: AB² = PA² + PB² - 2*PA*PB*cos(angle APB). Since PA=PB, let's call them x. Then AB² = 2x² - 2x² cos(120°). Cos(120°) is -0.5, so AB² = 2x² - 2x²*(-0.5) = 2x² + x² = 3x² → AB = x√3. So AB = x√3. Now, how do we find x?

But x is the length of the tangent from P to the circle. There's a formula for the length of a tangent from a point to a circle: PT = √(OP² - r²), where PT is the length of the tangent, OP is the distance from P to the center, and r is the radius. So if we can find OP, then we can compute x.

Earlier, we considered triangle OAP, which is right-angled at A. So OA is the radius, 10 units. Angle at P is 60°, so tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = OA / PA. Wait, in triangle OAP, angle at P is 60°, right angle at A. So tan(60°) = OA / PA. Because OA is opposite to angle P, and PA is adjacent. So tan(60°) = OA / PA → PA = OA / tan(60°). OA is 10, tan(60°) is √3. So PA = 10 / √3. Rationalizing, that's (10√3)/3. So x = PA = 10√3 / 3. Then AB = x√3 = (10√3 / 3) * √3 = 10*3 / 3 = 10. So AB is 10 units. Which corresponds to option B. But wait, there's another way to check.

Alternatively, since angle AOB is 60°, as earlier thought, and OA and OB are both 10, then triangle AOB is an equilateral triangle? Wait, OA=OB=10, angle AOB=60°, so yes, triangle AOB is equilateral. Therefore, AB=OA=OB=10. So AB is 10. Therefore, answer is B.

But wait, let me make sure about the angle AOB. How did I get that angle AOB is 60°? Earlier, I said that in triangle OAP, angle at O is 30°, and similarly for triangle OBP, so angle AOB would be 30°+30°=60°. That's assuming that the two angles at O (angle AOP and angle BOP) add up to angle AOB. Is that correct? Yes, because O is the center, and points A and B are on the circle. So OA and OB are two radii forming angle AOB. Since angle AOP and angle BOP are each 30°, adding up to 60°, which is angle AOB. Thus, triangle AOB is equilateral, hence AB=10. So answer B.

But wait, the answer choices include option C as 10√3, which would be if angle AOB was 120°, leading to AB=2*r*sin(θ/2)=2*10*sin(60)=10√3. So why is there confusion here?

Let me re-examine the calculation of angle AOB. In triangle OAP, right-angled at A, angle at P is 60°, so angle at O is 30°, which is angle AOP. Similarly, angle BOP is also 30°, so angle AOB is 30+30=60°, so central angle 60°, leading to AB=2r sin(θ/2)=2*10*sin(30)=10. So answer is B. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the angle at O.

Wait, another approach: since angle APB is 120°, and the two tangent segments PA and PB are equal. The angle between the two tangents is 120°, so the angle between OP and the tangents is... Well, the line OP bisects angle APB. So angle APO is 60°, as before. Then in triangle OAP, right-angled at A, with angle at P being 60°, so OA is adjacent to angle P. Wait, OA is the radius, which is opposite to angle P. Wait, in triangle OAP, right-angled at A, angle at P is 60°, so OA is opposite to angle P. So OA = OP * sin(angle at P). Wait, let's clarify.

In triangle OAP, right-angled at A, so:

sin(angle at P) = opposite/hypotenuse = OA / OP.

Which gives OA = OP * sin(angle at P).

Similarly, cos(angle at P) = adjacent/hypotenuse = PA / OP → PA = OP * cos(angle at P).

We know OA = 10. Let’s denote OP as d. Then,

10 = d * sin(60°)

Therefore, d = 10 / sin(60°) = 10 / (√3/2) ) = 20/√3 ≈ 11.547...

Then, PA = d * cos(60°) = (20/√3) * 0.5 = 10/√3 ≈ 5.773...

Now, in triangle APB, which is isoceles with PA=PB=10/√3, angle at P is 120°, so AB can be computed via Law of Cosines:

AB² = PA² + PB² - 2*PA*PB*cos(120°)

AB² = 2*(10/√3)^2 - 2*(10/√3)^2 * cos(120°)

Compute:

First term: 2*(100/3) = 200/3

Second term: 2*(100/3)*cos(120°). Cos(120°) is -0.5, so:

-2*(100/3)*(-0.5) = + (2*(100/3)*(0.5)) = 100/3

Thus, AB² = 200/3 + 100/3 = 300/3 = 100 → AB = sqrt(100) = 10. So AB is 10. Hence, answer B.

Another way: Since angle AOB is 60°, chord AB length is 2r sin(θ/2) = 2*10*sin(30°) = 20*(0.5) = 10. Same result.

So answer is B. But wait, the options are A:5, B:10, C:10√3, D:5√3. So answer is B. But let me check once more.

Wait, could there be an error in calculating angle AOB? Suppose angle APB is 120°, and the angle between the two tangents. The relationship between angle APB and the central angle AOB is that angle APB = ½ (angle AOB). Wait, no, actually, the angle between two tangents is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But since it's a circle, the angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. But in this case, the intercepted arcs are the major arc AB and minor arc AB. Since the tangents are drawn, the angle APB is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Since the total circumference is 360°, the major arc AB minus minor arc AB equals 360° - 2*minor arc AB. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, there's a formula that relates the angle between two tangents to the central angle. 

The angle between two tangents from an external point is equal to half the difference of the measure of the intercepted arcs. For two tangents, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Since the two arcs add up to 360°, and the angle between the tangents is 120°, so:

angle APB = ½ (major arc AB - minor arc AB) = 120°

Also, major arc AB + minor arc AB = 360°

Let me denote minor arc AB as x. Then major arc AB is 360° - x.

So:

½ [(360° - x) - x] = 120° → ½ (360° - 2x) = 120 → 180° - x = 120 → x = 60°

Therefore, minor arc AB is 60°, which means the central angle AOB is 60°, confirming previous results. Hence, chord AB is 2r sin(θ/2) = 2*10*sin(30°) = 10. So answer is B.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
