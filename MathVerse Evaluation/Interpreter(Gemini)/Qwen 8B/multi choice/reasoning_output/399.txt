MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand what they mean. 

Starting with the points: there's Point O, Point A, and Point B. Then there are lines: Line(O,A) and Line(O,B). So OA and OB are two lines starting at point O. The Angle(A,O,B) is mentioned, which means the angle at point O between points A and B. Also, it says that both lines OA and OB are radii of a circle centered at O. That tells me that OA and OB are both radii of the same circle, so their lengths should be equal. And indeed, the LengthOf(Line(O,A)) is 5 mm, and the same for Line(O,B). So OA and OB are each 5 mm long, making them equal radii.

Next, there's a Predicate that says Perpendicular(Line(O,A), Line(O,B)). So the lines OA and OB are perpendicular to each other. Since they're both radii of the circle and meet at O, forming a right angle, this creates a right angle at the center of the circle. 

Then there's the MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,B),90), confirming that the angle at O is a right angle. This makes sense because if two radii are perpendicular, the angle between them is 90 degrees. 

Now, looking at the question: we need to find the exact area of the given figure. The figure mentioned here is Sector(O,A,B). Wait, sector of a circle. But wait, the problem mentions a figure with a radius of 5 mm. Let me think. The sector would be the region bounded by the two radii OA and OB and the arc AB. Since OA and OB are radii of length 5 mm and form a right angle, the sector is a quarter-circle? Because a full circle is 360 degrees, and a right angle is 90 degrees, so it's one-fourth of the circle.

But let me verify. The formula for the area of a sector is (θ/360) × πr², where θ is the central angle in degrees. Here, θ is 90 degrees, r is 5 mm. Plugging in those numbers: (90/360) × π × 5² = (1/4) × π × 25 = 25π/4. 

Wait, but maybe the problem refers to something else? Let me check again. The predicates mention Sector(O,A,B), so that's definitely the sector formed by points O, A, B. So yes, the area would be that of a sector with central angle 90 degrees and radius 5. Therefore, 25π/4 square millimeters. However, the answer choices aren't listed here, but since the user said "no choices found," perhaps the original problem had options, but in this case, the assistant has to provide the answer directly. Wait, the user's instruction says "Answer Choices: No choices found." So maybe the actual problem was presented without options, and the user wants the exact answer. But according to the instructions, I have to pick one of A-D, but since there are no choices, maybe the system expects me to compute the answer. However, the user's last message says "select the correct answer choice" but since there are no choices, perhaps there was an error. But regardless, based on the given info, the area is 25π/4.

Alternatively, could there be another interpretation? For example, maybe the figure is not just the sector but includes some other elements? Let me re-examine the predicates. There's also the RightAngle(Angle(A,O,B)), which confirms the angle is 90 degrees. The Sector(O,A,B) is explicitly mentioned. So the figure is the sector. Hence, the area is 25π/4. 

So converting that into numerical terms, but the question says "exact area", so leaving it in terms of π is acceptable. Thus, the answer is 25π/4. However, if the answer choices were, say, options like A) 12.5π, B) 25π, etc., then the correct one would be A. But since the user hasn't provided options, but the initial setup says "answer choices: No choices found," perhaps the intended answer is 25π/4, which would correspond to one of the letters. But without knowing the options, I can't map it. Wait, the user's instruction says to select the correct answer choice, but since there are none, maybe the answer is supposed to be written as per the calculation. But the strict instructions require selecting A, B, C, or D. Maybe in the original problem, the answer choices included 25π/4 as option A, for example. Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is 25π/4, which would be option A. Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the area of the triangle AOB instead of the sector. Wait, but the predicate mentions Sector(O,A,B), so it's definitely the sector. The triangle would have area (base*height)/2 = (5*5)/2=12.5, but that's different. However, the problem states "the given figure" which is the sector. So the area is 25π/4. Assuming that the answer choices included this, the correct answer would be A. But since the user hasn't provided options, but the initial prompt says "answer choices: No choices found," perhaps the answer is expected to be written as 25π/4. However, the user instructed to choose from A-D. Since the problem didn't provide options, but the user's task requires choosing one, I'm confused. Wait, the original problem may have been part of a larger set where the answer choices are standard. But given the information, I'll go with the area of the sector being 25π/4, so if the answer options had that, it would be A. Hence, Final Answer: A.
