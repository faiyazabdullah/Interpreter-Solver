MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have a quadrilateral ABCD made up of two right-angled triangles, ABC and ACD. The given information includes some angles and lengths. Let me try to visualize this first.

First, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D. The lines are AB, BC, CA forming triangle ABC, and AD, DC forming triangle ACD. Also, there's a quadrilateral ABCD. The measure of angle at B, which is angle ABC, is 35 degrees. There's a right angle at BCD, so angle BCD is 90 degrees. The length of BC is 13 units. We need to find the measure of angle ACD.

Wait, the problem mentions angle B is 35°, but angle B here refers to angle ABC? Because in triangle ABC, angle at B is angle ABC. Also, they mention right angles at BCD, which would be angle at C between BC and CD. Also, there's a right angle at Angle(C,D,A) which I think is angle ADC? Wait, the predicates list RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)) which is angle at C between B and D, so angle BCD. Then another RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)), which is angle at D between C and A, so angle CDA?

Let me sketch mentally. Quadrilateral ABCD has two right triangles: ABC and ACD. Since ABC is a right triangle, and since there's a right angle at BCD (so angle BCD is 90°), maybe ABC is right-angled at B? Wait, because in the predicates, it says RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)), which is angle at C between B and A. Wait, angle BCA? Or angle at C in triangle ABC? Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)) means the angle at point C between points B and A. So that's angle BCA, which is part of triangle ABC. But if that's a right angle, then triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Wait, but earlier the problem states that angle B is 35°, which would be angle ABC. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Let me check again.

Wait, the given predicates say:

RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)): This is angle at C between B and A, so angle BCA. So triangle ABC has a right angle at C. That would make triangle ABC right-angled at C. Then angle at B (ABC) is 35°, so angle ABC = 35°, angle at C is 90°, so angle at A (BAC) would be 180 - 35 - 90 = 55°. 

Then there's another right angle at Angle(C,D,A): which is angle at D between C and A, so angle CDA. So triangle ACD is right-angled at D. Therefore, triangle ACD has a right angle at D. So angle ADC is 90°, and angle at A (DAC) and angle at C (DCA) would sum to 90°. 

But we need to find angle ACD, which is angle at C in triangle ACD, between A and D. So angle DCA. 

So, how do we relate these parts? Since ABCD is a quadrilateral made of triangles ABC and ACD. Let me think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point C at the origin (0,0). Since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, so points B and A would lie along axes. Let me assume point C is (0,0). Then, since BC is 13 units, and angle at C is right, suppose BC is along x-axis and AC along y-axis. So point B would be at (13, 0), point C is (0,0). Point A would be somewhere along y-axis. Let me denote point A as (0, y). Then AB connects A(0,y) to B(13,0).

Now, angle ABC is 35°, which is angle at B between points A, B, C. Let me compute coordinates. In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So AB is hypotenuse. Let me calculate AB length. Using Pythagoras, AB² = AC² + BC². But BC is 13, AC is y. So AB = sqrt(y² + 169). 

In triangle ABC, angle at B is 35°, so tan(angle ABC) = opposite over adjacent. Which would be AC / BC. Wait, angle at B: opposite side is AC, adjacent is BC. Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at B. The sides relative to angle B: opposite is AC, adjacent is BC. So tan(35°) = AC / BC → AC = BC * tan(35°). Since BC is 13, AC = 13 * tan(35°). Let me compute that. Tan(35°) ≈ 0.7002. So AC ≈ 13 * 0.7002 ≈ 9.1026. So coordinates of A would be (0, ~9.1026). Let me keep it symbolic for now. Let me call AC = 13 tan(35°).

Now, moving to triangle ACD, which is right-angled at D. The right angle is at D, so angle ADC is 90°. Points involved are A, D, C. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral, point D is connected to A and C. From the given, Line(D,C) is present, and Line(A,D). Also, there's a perpendicularity between Line(A,D) and Line(D,C). Wait, the predicates say Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(D,C)). So line AD is perpendicular to line DC. Since DC is part of the quadrilateral, and since DC is connected to C and D. Wait, line DC is from D to C. Since triangle ACD is right-angled at D, so angle at D is 90°, so AD is perpendicular to DC. Thus, AD ⊥ DC. Therefore, line AD is perpendicular to DC, making triangle ACD right-angled at D.

So, considering point D. Since DC is connected to C (which is at (0,0)), and AD is perpendicular to DC. So direction of DC depends on where D is. Let me think about coordinates again. Since DC is from D to C, which is (0,0). Suppose DC is horizontal or vertical? Well, in triangle ACD, right-angled at D. So DC and DA are legs. Let me consider coordinates for D. Let me assume that DC is horizontal, so from D to C is horizontal. Then DA would be vertical. But need to ensure consistency with other parts.

Alternatively, since line AD is perpendicular to DC, and DC is connected to point C (origin). Let me assign coordinates to D such that DC is a vector, and DA is perpendicular to DC. Let me define coordinates for D. Let me suppose that DC has coordinates such that D is at (x, y), and C is at (0,0). Then vector DC is (0 - x, 0 - y) = (-x, -y). Vector DA is from D to A: A is (0, a) where a is AC length (from before, 13 tan(35°)). So vector DA is (0 - x, a - y) = (-x, a - y). For DA to be perpendicular to DC, their dot product must be zero. So (-x)(-x) + (a - y)(-y) = 0 → x² - y(a - y) = 0 → x² - ay + y² = 0. 

Hmm, but without more info, perhaps there's another way. Alternatively, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, and we know coordinates for A, B, C. Let me see if I can find coordinates for D.

Since ABCD is a quadrilateral with sides AB, BC, CD, DA. We already have AB, BC, and CD is connected to D. Also, line AD connects A to D. Also, from the predicates, there's a quadrilateral ABCD, so the order is A-B-C-D-A. So connecting A to D. Now, since triangle ACD is right-angled at D, so D lies somewhere such that AD ⊥ DC. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use slopes. Let me try again with coordinates. Let me fix coordinates as follows:

Let’s take C at (0, 0), B at (13, 0) since BC = 13. A is at (0, a), where a = AC. As computed before, a = 13 tan(35°). Let me compute tan(35°). Let me recall that tan(35°) is approximately 0.7002, so a ≈ 9.1026. So coordinates:

A: (0, 9.1026)
B: (13, 0)
C: (0, 0)
Now, need to find coordinates of D such that:

- D is connected to C (so line DC)
- AD is perpendicular to DC
- Triangle ACD is right-angled at D
- Also, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, D should connect back to A.

So, for AD to be perpendicular to DC. Let me denote D as (d_x, d_y). Then vector DC is (0 - d_x, 0 - d_y) = (-d_x, -d_y). Vector DA is (0 - d_x, a - d_y) = (-d_x, a - d_y). Their dot product must be zero:

(-d_x)(-d_x) + (-d_y)(a - d_y) = 0 → d_x² - d_y a + d_y² = 0 → d_x² + d_y² = a d_y.

That's one equation. Additionally, since D is part of quadrilateral ABCD, which connects to A and C. Also, we need to ensure that the quadrilateral closes properly. However, maybe there's more constraints. Let me think.

Also, since there's a right angle at angle BCD (which is angle at C between B and D). Wait, the given predicate says RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)), which is angle at C between B, C, D. So angle BCD is 90°, which we already considered. Since point C is at (0,0), B is at (13,0), and D is connected to C. So angle at C between B and D is 90°, meaning that CB is along x-axis from C to B (vector (13,0)), and CD is another vector from C to D, which must be perpendicular to CB. Since CB is along positive x-axis, then CD must be along positive or negative y-axis to form a right angle at C. Wait, but angle BCD is 90°, so vectors CB and CD are perpendicular. Since CB is from C to B, which is (13,0), so direction along x-axis. Therefore, CD must be along y-axis. Hence, point D must lie along the y-axis. Wait, because if CD is perpendicular to CB, which is along x-axis, then CD must be vertical. So since C is at (0,0), D must be along the y-axis. So coordinates of D would be (0, k) for some k. But wait, then DC is along y-axis from C(0,0) to D(0,k). Then AD is from A(0,a) to D(0,k). So line AD is vertical (since same x-coordinate). Then DC is vertical, so AD and DC are both vertical, hence not perpendicular unless they are overlapping. Wait, but the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(D,C)). So AD must be perpendicular to DC. If DC is vertical, then AD must be horizontal. But if D is on y-axis, then AD is vertical (same x-coordinate as A and D), which would not be horizontal. Contradiction. So my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, angle BCD is 90°, which is angle at C between B and D. So vectors CB and CD are perpendicular. CB is from C to B, which is (13,0). CD is from C to D. So vector CD is (dx, dy), and CB · CD = 0. So (13, 0) · (dx, dy) = 13*dx + 0*dy = 13 dx = 0 → dx = 0. Therefore, D must have x-coordinate 0. So D is at (0, dy). Therefore, D lies along the y-axis. But then DC is vertical (from C(0,0) to D(0, dy)), and AD is from A(0,a) to D(0, dy). So AD is vertical line, same as DC. Hence, AD and DC are colinear, meaning they are not perpendicular. But the predicate says they are perpendicular. Contradiction. What's wrong here?

Ah! Wait, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(D,C)). So line AD and line DC must be perpendicular. But if D is on y-axis, then line DC is vertical (along y-axis), and line AD is also vertical, so they are not perpendicular. Hence, contradiction. So my previous conclusion that D is on y-axis must be wrong. Where is the mistake?

Wait, angle BCD is 90°, which is the angle between CB and CD. CB is from C to B (right along x-axis), and CD is from C to D. So CB vector is (13,0), CD vector is (dx, dy). Their dot product is 13*dx + 0*dy = 13 dx = 0 ⇒ dx=0. Hence, D must be on y-axis. So that suggests D is (0, dy). But then line DC is vertical, line AD is vertical (since A is (0,a) and D is (0, dy)), hence AD and DC are colinear, not perpendicular. This contradicts the predicate that they are perpendicular. Therefore, something is wrong with my assumptions.

Wait, maybe I misread the angle. The RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)) is angle at C between B, C, D. So that's angle BCD. Which is formed by points B, C, D. So CB and CD are the two sides forming the angle at C. Hence, those two vectors are perpendicular. So as per calculation, D must be on y-axis. But then line DC is vertical, line AD is vertical, which cannot be perpendicular. So this suggests inconsistency in the problem? Or perhaps my coordinate system assumption is flawed.

Wait, perhaps the right angle at BCD is not between CB and CD, but between BC and CD? No, angle at C is between B, C, D, so yes, it's between CB and CD. So my calculation holds. Therefore, there's a conflict. How can this be resolved?

Maybe my initial assumption of placing C at (0,0) and B at (13,0) is causing issues. Let me try another approach. Perhaps triangle ABC is right-angled at B instead of C? Wait, but the given predicate says RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)), which is angle at C. So that would mean triangle ABC is right-angled at C. So that's fixed. Hence, the problem arises.

Wait, maybe the error is in assuming that angle BCD is 90°, which is angle at C between B, C, D. But if D is on y-axis, then line DC is vertical, and line AD is vertical, making them colinear, not perpendicular. Hence, this suggests that there's an inconsistency unless AD is horizontal. Wait, but how?

Wait, if D is on y-axis, then AD is vertical. To make AD perpendicular to DC (which is also vertical), they need to be perpendicular. But vertical lines are parallel, not perpendicular. So this implies that there's a contradiction. Hence, my earlier assumption that D is on y-axis must be incorrect. But according to the dot product condition, D must be on y-axis. Where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the angle. Is the right angle at BCD referring to angle at D? No, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)), which is angle at C. So angle at C between B and D. Hence, vectors CB and CD must be perpendicular. So D must be on y-axis. Then why is AD perpendicular to DC? Unless DC is not vertical? Wait, but if D is on y-axis, DC is vertical. So this seems impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding.

Wait, let me re-examine the predicates. The user listed several predicates, including:

RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D))

Which is angle at C between B and D, i.e., angle BCD is 90°. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(D,C)). So line AD is perpendicular to line DC. So DC is a line from D to C, and AD is a line from A to D. These two lines must be perpendicular. 

Given that DC is from D to C, and AD is from A to D. So, if D is on y-axis (as required by angle BCD being 90°), then DC is vertical, and AD is from A(0,a) to D(0,d), which is vertical. Hence, AD and DC are colinear, not perpendicular. Hence, contradiction. This suggests that either my coordinate setup is wrong, or there's a miscalculation.

Alternative approach: Maybe the right angle at BCD is not at C, but at D? No, the predicate specifies Angle(B,C,D), which is angle at C. 

Wait, perhaps the quadrilateral isn't convex? Or maybe D is not on the y-axis? But according to the perpendicularity of CB and CD, D must be on y-axis. 

This seems like a paradox. Let me think differently. Maybe the right angle at BCD is not between CB and CD, but between BC and CD? Wait, no. Angle at C between B and D is between CB and CD. 

Wait, unless the angle is measured in a different way. Maybe the angle is at D? No, the predicate is Angle(B,C,D), which is angle at C. 

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram is not planar? Unlikely. 

Wait, let's think of another possibility. Maybe line DC is not aligned with the y-axis. But how can angle BCD be 90° if D is not on y-axis? Because if CB is along x-axis from C(0,0) to B(13,0), then for CD to be perpendicular to CB, it must be along y-axis. Hence, D must be on y-axis. 

Thus, the only way for AD to be perpendicular to DC is if DC is vertical and AD is horizontal. But if D is on y-axis, then AD is vertical. So this is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction, suggesting an error in the problem setup or my understanding.

Wait, maybe the right angle at BCD is not between CB and CD, but between BC and CD? Wait, angle at C is between BC and CD. Yes. So CB is from C to B, CD is from C to D. They must be perpendicular. So D must be on y-axis. But then AD is vertical, and DC is vertical, so AD and DC are colinear, not perpendicular. 

Unless AD is horizontal? How can AD be horizontal if D is on y-axis? A is at (0,a), D is at (0, dy). So line AD is vertical. Hence, no. 

This suggests that the problem may have inconsistent conditions, but since it's a problem given, there must be a resolution. Perhaps my coordinate assignment is incorrect. Let me try a different coordinate system.

Alternative idea: Let me not fix C at (0,0). Let me choose coordinates such that point C is at origin, point B is at (0, b), point A is at (a, 0), making triangle ABC right-angled at C. Wait, if ABC is right-angled at C, then AC and BC are perpendicular. So if I put C at (0,0), A at (a, 0), and B at (0, b). Then AB would be the hypotenuse. Then angle at B (angle ABC) is between BA and BC. Let me calculate that. 

Coordinates: C(0,0), A(a,0), B(0,b). Then vector BA is from B to A: (a - 0, 0 - b) = (a, -b). Vector BC is from B to C: (0 - 0, 0 - b) = (0, -b). The angle at B is between BA and BC. So the angle between vectors BA and BC. Let me compute tan(theta) where theta is angle at B.

The slope of BA: from B(0,b) to A(a,0), slope is (0 - b)/(a - 0) = -b/a. The slope of BC is from B(0,b) to C(0,0), which is vertical line. So angle between BA and BC is angle between BA and vertical line. So tan(theta) = |horizontal change| / |vertical change|. Wait, the angle between BA and vertical line BC. The BA has slope -b/a, which corresponds to angle phi from the vertical, where tan(phi) = (a)/b. Hence, angle at B is phi, where tan(phi) = a/b. Given that angle at B is 35°, so tan(35°) = a/b → a = b tan(35°). 

Now, length BC is from B(0,b) to C(0,0), which is length b. Given that BC = 13, so b = 13. Hence, a = 13 tan(35°). 

Now, need to find coordinates of D such that:

1. Triangle ACD is right-angled at D (Angle(C,D,A) is right, i.e., angle at D between C and A).
2. Line AD is perpendicular to Line DC (Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(D,C))).
3. Angle BCD is 90°, which in this coordinate system is angle at C between B and D. Since B is at (0,13), C is at (0,0), so vector CB is (0,-13). Vector CD is from C(0,0) to D(x,y). For angle BCD to be 90°, vectors CB and CD must be perpendicular. CB is (0,-13), CD is (x,y). Dot product is 0*x + (-13)*y = -13y = 0 → y=0. Hence, D must lie on x-axis. So D is (d, 0) for some d. 

Now, since D is on x-axis, coordinates of D are (d, 0). Now, line DC is from D(d,0) to C(0,0), which is along x-axis. Line AD is from A(a,0) to D(d,0), which is also along x-axis. So AD and DC are both along x-axis, hence collinear, not perpendicular. Again, contradiction with Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(D,C)). 

This suggests that regardless of coordinate system, if angle BCD is 90°, then D lies on x-axis (if CB is vertical), leading to AD and DC being collinear, hence not perpendicular. Hence, contradiction. 

What's the issue here? It seems like the given conditions are conflicting. But since it's a problem given, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the right angle at BCD is not between CB and CD, but between BC and CD? Wait, no. Angle at C between B and D is between CB and CD. 

Wait, maybe the right angle at BCD is not in the triangle BCD, but in the quadrilateral? Or maybe I'm missing something else. Let me revisit the original problem statement.

Problem says: "the quadrilateral ABCD in the figure is composed of two right-angled triangles ABC and ACD, angle B is 35°, angle BCD is a right angle, the length of BC is 13."

Wait, angle B is 35°, which is angle ABC. Angle BCD is a right angle. So angle at C between B and D is 90°. And the quadrilateral is made of triangles ABC and ACD, which are both right-angled. 

Perhaps the triangles are not sharing the same right angle? Wait, triangle ABC is right-angled at C (from the predicate RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A))), and triangle ACD is right-angled at D (from RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A))). So, triangle ABC right at C, triangle ACD right at D. 

So, with that, let's try to think of the configuration. Let me imagine ABC right-angled at C, and ACD right-angled at D. So, point D is such that AD is perpendicular to DC. 

Let me try to construct this. Let me take point C, with BC = 13, and angle ABC = 35°. Let me draw triangle ABC right-angled at C. So, as before, with C at (0,0), B at (13,0), A at (0, a), where a = 13 tan(35°). Now, need to find D such that:

- D forms triangle ACD right-angled at D.
- Line AD is perpendicular to DC.
- Angle BCD is 90°, so angle at C between B and D is 90°.

From angle BCD being 90°, as before, D must be on y-axis. Wait, no. If C is at (0,0), B is at (13,0), then for angle BCD to be 90°, vector CB is (13,0), vector CD must be perpendicular to CB. So CD vector is (x, y) such that (13,0)·(x,y) = 13x + 0*y = 13x = 0 → x=0. Hence, D is at (0, y). So D is on y-axis. 

Now, line DC is from D(0,y) to C(0,0), which is vertical. Line AD is from A(0,a) to D(0,y), which is vertical. Hence, AD and DC are collinear, not perpendicular. This violates the condition that they are perpendicular. 

Therefore, this suggests that under these conditions, it's impossible. But since the problem exists, there must be a solution. Perhaps the error is in assuming that triangle ABC is right-angled at C? Let me double-check the predicates. 

The given predicates include RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)), which is angle at C between B and A, so angle BCA. Hence, triangle ABC is right-angled at C. So that's fixed. 

Wait, perhaps the right angle at BCD is not at C, but at D? No, the predicate says Angle(B,C,D), which is at C. 

This is perplexing. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the angle. Let me re-read the predicates.

The given predicates include:

RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)) – this is angle at C between B and D.

Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(D,C)) – lines AD and DC are perpendicular.

So, if D is on y-axis, then DC is vertical, AD is vertical, so they are not perpendicular. Hence, contradiction. 

Wait, unless D is at infinity? No. 

Alternatively, maybe D is not on the y-axis? But how? If angle BCD is 90°, then it must be. 

Wait, perhaps the angle BCD is not in the plane? No. 

This seems like a dead end. Maybe I should proceed with the given data despite the apparent contradiction, and see if angle ACD can be determined. 

Let me proceed with D on y-axis. Even though AD and DC are collinear, maybe the problem assumes that they are perpendicular due to some other reason. Let me try to compute angle ACD. 

Point A is (0,a), C is (0,0), D is (0,y). So angle ACD is the angle at C between A, C, D. Since A and D are both on y-axis, angle ACD is the angle between CA and CD. Since both are along y-axis, but in opposite directions. If D is above C, then angle ACD is 180°, which is impossible. If D is below C, then angle ACD is 180°, still impossible. Hence, this suggests that angle ACD is undefined, which can't be. 

Clearly, there's a flaw in the setup. But since the problem asks for angle ACD, there must be a solution. Perhaps the error is in assuming that both triangles are right-angled at C and D respectively. Let me check the predicates again.

The predicates include:

RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)) → angle at C in triangle ABC is right.

RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)) → angle at D in triangle ACD is right.

Yes. So, triangle ABC is right-angled at C, triangle ACD is right-angled at D. 

But with the conditions on angle BCD being 90°, which forces D to be on y-axis, leading to AD and DC being collinear, which conflicts with perpendicularity. 

Maybe the error is in the assumption that angle BCD is part of triangle BCD, but it's actually part of the quadrilateral. Let me think differently. Maybe angle BCD is not between CB and CD, but between BC and CD? Wait, that's the same thing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the diagram is not convex, and D is positioned such that CD extends in a different direction. But according to the perpendicular condition, it must be. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find angle ACD using trigonometry despite the contradictions. 

Let me consider triangle ACD, which is right-angled at D. So, angle at D is 90°, and we need angle at C, which is angle ACD. In triangle ACD, angle at C is angle ACD, angle at D is 90°, and angle at A is angle DAC. Sum to 180°. So angle ACD = 90° - angle DAC. 

To find angle DAC, we need to know sides of triangle ACD. Let me try to find lengths. 

We know BC = 13, and in triangle ABC, right-angled at C, with angle at B being 35°. So as before, AC = 13 tan(35°). Let me compute AC: tan(35°) ≈ 0.7002, so AC ≈ 13 * 0.7002 ≈ 9.1026. 

Now, in triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so by Pythagoras: AC² = AD² + DC². But we don't know AD or DC. 

However, we also have that angle BCD is 90°, which might relate to DC. Since angle at C between B and D is 90°, and BC = 13, if we can find DC, we could relate it to AC. 

Wait, in triangle BCD, which is right-angled at C, with BC = 13, and CD being some length. But wait, is BCD a right triangle? Yes, because angle BCD is 90°, so triangle BCD is right-angled at C. So, BD is the hypotenuse. But we don't know BD or CD. 

However, since D is part of quadrilateral ABCD, and line AD is connected to D. Let me think about coordinates again. Assume C is at (0,0), B at (13,0), A at (0, a), with a = 13 tan(35°). D is somewhere such that angle BCD is 90°, so D is on y-axis. Let me take D at (0, d). Now, even though AD and DC are collinear, let's proceed. 

Then, in triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so AD and DC are legs. But if D is on y-axis, then AD is from (0,a) to (0,d), length is |a - d|. DC is from (0,0) to (0,d), length is |d|. So in triangle ACD, right-angled at D, we have:

AC² = AD² + DC² → (13 tan(35°))² = (a - d)^2 + d^2. 

But a = 13 tan(35°), so substituting:

(13 tan(35°))^2 = (13 tan(35°) - d)^2 + d^2.

Expanding the right-hand side: (13 tan(35°))^2 - 2*13 tan(35°)*d + d^2 + d^2 = (13 tan(35°))^2 - 2*13 tan(35°)*d + 2d^2.

Setting equal to left side:

(13 tan(35°))^2 = (13 tan(35°))^2 - 2*13 tan(35°)*d + 2d^2.

Subtract (13 tan(35°))^2 from both sides:

0 = -2*13 tan(35°)*d + 2d^2 → 2d^2 - 2*13 tan(35°)*d = 0 → 2d(d - 13 tan(35°)) = 0. 

Solutions: d = 0 or d = 13 tan(35°). 

d=0 would place D at C, which is invalid. So d = 13 tan(35°). Hence, D is at (0, 13 tan(35°)). 

But then, point D coincides with A? Wait, A is at (0, a) = (0, 13 tan(35°)), so D is at (0, a). Hence, D and A are the same point? No, that's impossible. Hence, this suggests that the only solution is D=A, which is invalid. 

This indicates that under the given conditions, there is no valid position for D except overlapping with A, which is impossible. Hence, the problem is contradictory. But since it's presented as solvable, I must have made a mistake. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me recheck:

Original equation: AC² = AD² + DC².

With AC = 13 tan(35°), AD = |a - d|, DC = |d|.

So, (13 tan(35°))^2 = (a - d)^2 + d^2. 

But a = 13 tan(35°), so substitute:

(13 tan(35°))^2 = (13 tan(35°) - d)^2 + d^2.

Expand right side: (13 tan(35°))^2 - 2*13 tan(35°)*d + d^2 + d^2 = (13 tan(35°))^2 - 2*13 tan(35°)*d + 2d^2.

Set equal to left side: 

(13 tan(35°))^2 = (13 tan(35°))^2 - 2*13 tan(35°)*d + 2d^2.

Subtract (13 tan(35°))^2: 0 = -2*13 tan(35°)*d + 2d^2 → 2d^2 - 2*13 tan(35°)*d = 0 → d(2d - 2*13 tan(35°)) = 0 → d = 0 or d = 13 tan(35°). 

As before. Hence, no valid solution except d=0 or d=a, which places D at C or A. Hence, no solution. 

This suggests that the problem is ill-posed. But since the problem exists, there must be a solution. Perhaps the error is in assuming that angle BCD is part of triangle BCD, but it's actually part of the quadrilateral. Let me think differently. 

Maybe angle BCD is not in triangle BCD, but in the quadrilateral, and D is not on y-axis. Let me drop the condition that angle BCD is 90° and see. Wait, no, the problem states angle BCD is a right angle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle at BCD is not between CB and CD, but between BC and CD, but in a different orientation. For example, if D is placed such that CD is not extending from C in the direction perpendicular to CB, but in some other way. But according to the dot product, it must be. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach, ignoring the coordinate system. Let me focus on the triangles.

We have two right triangles: ABC (right at C) and ACD (right at D). We know angle at B (angle ABC) is 35°, BC = 13, and angle BCD is 90°. Need to find angle ACD.

Let me consider triangle ABC: right-angled at C, angle at B is 35°, so angle at A is 55°. Then, in triangle ABC, tan(35°) = AC/BC → AC = BC * tan(35°) = 13 tan(35°). 

Now, in triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so angle at D is 90°, and we need angle at C, which is angle ACD. Let me denote angle ACD as x. Then, in triangle ACD, angle at A is 90° - x. 

Now, looking at the quadrilateral ABCD, the sum of angles at C: in triangle ABC, angle at C is 90°, and in triangle ACD, angle at C is x. But since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the total angle at C would be 90° + x? Or is there overlap? Wait, no. At point C, there are two angles: one from triangle ABC (90°) and one from triangle ACD (x). But since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the total angle at C would be the sum of these two angles, unless they are supplementary. 

Wait, if the quadrilateral is made of triangles ABC and ACD, then at point C, the angles from the two triangles would add up. However, in a simple quadrilateral, the sum of angles at each vertex is determined by the shape. But if the two triangles share the side AC, then at point C, the angles from the two triangles would be the internal angle of the quadrilateral. 

Wait, but if the quadrilateral is made of triangles ABC and ACD, then at point C, the angle would be the angle between BC and DC. Which is given as angle BCD = 90°. Wait, but earlier we had angle at C in triangle ABC is 90°, and angle at C in triangle ACD is x. But the total angle at C in the quadrilateral is angle BCD = 90°, which would imply that the sum of the angles from the two triangles at C is 90°. But in triangle ABC, the angle at C is 90°, and in triangle ACD, the angle at C is x. So 90° + x = 90° → x = 0°, which is impossible. 

This suggests another contradiction. Hence, the problem's conditions are conflicting. 

But since the problem is given, perhaps the correct approach is to ignore the contradiction and proceed with the available data. Let me assume that angle ACD is x, and use triangle ACD. 

In triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so AC² = AD² + DC². 

Also, in triangle BCD, right-angled at C, so BD² = BC² + CD². 

But we don't know BD or DC. 

However, if we can relate AD and DC through some other relationship. 

Wait, from triangle ABC, AC = 13 tan(35°). Let me denote this as AC = 13 tan(35°). 

In triangle ACD, AC is the hypotenuse, so AC² = AD² + DC². 

But we need another equation to relate AD and DC. Perhaps through the fact that D is connected to A and C, and the quadrilateral is closed. 

Alternatively, since AD is perpendicular to DC, then in triangle ACD, AD is one leg, DC is another, and AC is hypotenuse. So, AC² = AD² + DC². 

But without knowing AD or DC, it's hard to proceed. 

Wait, but if we consider triangle BCD, right-angled at C, then BD is the hypotenuse. But BD is also part of the quadrilateral. 

But without more information, it's difficult to find relations. 

Maybe using trigonometry in triangle ACD. Let me denote angle ACD as x. In triangle ACD, angle at D is 90°, angle at C is x, so angle at A is 90° - x. 

Now, in triangle ABC, angle at A is 55°, which is angle BAC. In triangle ACD, angle at A is angle DAC = 90° - x. 

But angle BAC and angle DAC are parts of the larger angle at A in the quadrilateral. Assuming the quadrilateral is convex, the total angle at A would be angle BAC + angle DAC = 55° + (90° - x). 

But without knowing the total angle at A, this doesn't help directly. 

Alternatively, if we consider that points B, A, D are connected, but I don't have enough info. 

At this point, I'm stuck and unable to resolve the contradictions in the problem's conditions. However, since the problem requires an answer, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that angle ACD is 55°, as it is complementary to angle at A in triangle ABC. 

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at A is 55°, and if in triangle ACD, angle at A is 90° - x, and if these two angles are related... but I don't see the connection. 

Alternatively, since AC is common to both triangles, and in triangle ABC, AC = 13 tan(35°), and in triangle ACD, AC is the hypotenuse. 

Let me assume that in triangle ACD, AC is the hypotenuse, and angle at C is x. Then, sin(x) = opposite/hypotenuse = AD/AC. But I don't know AD. 

Alternatively, cos(x) = adjacent/hypotenuse = DC/AC. 

But without knowing DC, I can't find x. 

Wait, but from triangle BCD, right-angled at C, BC = 13, and CD is some length, say y. Then, BD = sqrt(13² + y²). 

But BD is also the hypotenuse of triangle ABD? Not sure. 

Alternatively, if I consider that AD is perpendicular to DC, then AD is the height from A to DC. But I don't know where D is. 

Given the time I've spent without resolving the contradictions, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the given data. Since angle at B is 35°, and in triangle ABC, angle at C is 90°, angle at A is 55°. If in triangle ACD, angle at C is x, and if there's a relation between angles at A, maybe x is 55°. 

But this is pure speculation. Alternatively, since angle BCD is 90°, and in triangle BCD, angle at C is 90°, BC = 13, and if CD is such that AD is perpendicular to DC, then perhaps using some trigonometric identities. 

Let me try to express AC in terms of CD and AD. 

From triangle ACD: AC² = AD² + CD². 

From triangle BCD: BD² = BC² + CD². 

But BD is also related to AD. If AD is perpendicular to DC, then AD is the altitude from A to DC. But I don't know. 

Alternatively, if I consider that AD is perpendicular to DC, then AD is the height of triangle ADC. 

But without more info, I can't proceed. 

Given that I'm stuck, I'll make an assumption that angle ACD is 55°, as it complements the angle at A in triangle ABC. Hence, Final Answer: A.
