MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about comparing the maximum values of two functions, f(x) and g(x). Both are quadratic functions, and we need to determine which one has a greater maximum. 

First, I'll recall that quadratic functions have graphs that are parabolas. The general form is f(x) = ax² + bx + c. The direction the parabola opens depends on the coefficient 'a'. If 'a' is positive, it opens upwards, and if 'a' is negative, it opens downwards. Since the problem mentions that g(x) is a quadratic function opening downward, that means its leading coefficient is negative. On the other hand, f(x) is given explicitly as f(x) = -5(x + 4)² + 8. Let me check that. The standard form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Here, the equation is written as f(x) = -5(x + 4)² + 8, so expanding that would give us the vertex form directly. Comparing to the standard form, the vertex (h, k) is at (-4, 8). Wait, but the problem says that the vertex of g is at (-8, 8). So, the vertex of g is (-8, 8), and for f, it's (-4, 8). 

Now, since both are quadratic functions opening downward (as mentioned for g, and f's coefficient is -5, so definitely opening downward), their maximums occur at their vertices. Therefore, the maximum value of each function is the y-coordinate of their respective vertices. 

So for function f(x), the vertex is at (-4, 8), so the maximum value is 8. For function g(x), the vertex is at (-8, 8), so its maximum value is also 8. Wait, but hold on—the problem states that g(x) is a quadratic function opening downward with vertex (-8, 8), so its maximum is 8. And f(x) is given as -5(x + 4)^2 + 8, which has vertex at (-4, 8), so maximum is also 8. Then both have the same maximum? But wait, maybe there's something wrong here. Let me double-check.

Wait, the problem says "Which function has a greater maximum?" If both have the same maximum value, then the answer would be C. However, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the given information. 

Looking back at the predicates: There's a mention of Shape(g) and Equals(y, g(x)). Also, VertexOf(g, Point(A)) and Equals(A, (-8,8)). So the vertex of g is at point A, which is (-8,8). For f(x), the equation is given as f(x) = -5(x + 4)^2 + 8. That's already in vertex form, so vertex is at x = -4, y = 8. Therefore, both functions have their maximum at y=8. Hence, they share the same maximum. But wait, could there be a mistake here? Because sometimes people confuse the vertex coordinates. Let me confirm again.

For f(x): The formula is -5(x + 4)^2 + 8. So the vertex is at x = -4, because the term inside the square is (x + 4), which is (x - (-4)), so h is -4. The y-coordinate is 8. So yes, vertex at (-4, 8). For g(x), the vertex is given as (-8, 8). So both have maximum value of 8. Thus, their maximums are equal. Therefore, the answer should be C. But wait, looking at the options, C is "f and g share the same maximum." So the answer would be C. 

But let me make sure that there isn't some trick here. Maybe the problem refers to different functions? Let me check the original problem again. It says "g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex of (-8,8)." So the vertex of g is (-8,8), so maximum value is 8. The function f(x) is given as -5(x+4)^2 + 8, which has vertex at (-4,8), so maximum is 8. Therefore, both have maximum 8. So they share the same maximum. Therefore, answer is C. 

Hmm, but why is there an option A and B? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Is there a possibility that the maximum of g(x) is higher? Wait, the maximum of a quadratic function is determined solely by the vertex's y-coordinate. Since both have their vertex at y=8, regardless of where the vertex is located along the x-axis, the maximum value is the same. Therefore, even though their vertices are at different x-coordinates, their maximums are the same. So the answer should be C. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that the x-coordinate affects the maximum? No, the maximum value is purely the y-coordinate of the vertex. So unless there's some other factor, like scaling, but in this case, both functions have the same y-coordinate for their vertex. Therefore, the answer is C.
