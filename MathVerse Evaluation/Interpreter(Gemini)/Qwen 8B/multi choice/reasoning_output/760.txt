Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a circle with center P and radius r. Lines AB and AC are tangents to the circle. Points M is the midpoint of AC. Also, it says that the measure of angle PMC equals the measure of angle MPC. We need to find the length of PA in terms of r.

First, since AB and AC are tangent to the circle centered at P, then PB and PC should be radii perpendicular to AB and AC respectively. Wait, the problem mentions that Line(P,B) and Line(P,C) are radii, so they're perpendicular to AB and AC. That makes sense because the radius at the point of tangency is perpendicular to the tangent line. So, angles at B and C between PB and AB, and PC and AC are right angles.

So triangle PBA and PCA are right triangles. Let me draw this mentally. Point A is outside the circle, with two tangent lines AB and AC touching the circle at points B and C. Then PB and PC are radii, each perpendicular to AB and AC. Therefore, PB ⊥ AB and PC ⊥ AC.

Now, M is the midpoint of AC. Also, given that angle PMC equals angle MPC. Hmm. Let me think about triangle PMC. Since M is the midpoint of AC, AM = MC. So in triangle PMC, if angles at M (anglePMC) and at P (angleMPC) are equal, then triangle PMC is isosceles with sides opposite those angles being equal. Wait, but angle at P is angle MPC, which would correspond to side MC, and angle at M is angle PMC, corresponding to side PC. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, in triangle PMC, angle at M is angle PMC, and angle at P is angle MPC. If these angles are equal, then the sides opposite them should be equal. The side opposite angle PMC is PC, and the side opposite angle MPC is MC. So, PC = MC. But PC is a radius of the circle, so PC = r. Therefore, MC = r. But since M is the midpoint of AC, then AC = 2*MC = 2r. So AC = 2r. 

But how does this relate to PA? Let's recall that in the configuration with two tangents from a common external point A to a circle, the lengths of the tangents are equal. So AB = AC. Wait, but here AB and AC are both tangents from A to the circle, so AB = AC. However, earlier we found that AC = 2r, so AB = AC = 2r as well. 

But wait, AB is a tangent, so AB^2 = PA^2 - PB^2, since in the right triangle PBA, PA is hypotenuse. So AB^2 + PB^2 = PA^2. Since PB is radius r, AB^2 + r^2 = PA^2. But AB is equal to AC, which we thought was 2r. Wait, but earlier conclusion that AC = 2r came from MC = r. Is that correct?

Let me re-examine. From the condition that angles PMC and MPC are equal. So in triangle PMC, angles at M and P are equal. So sides opposite are equal. The side opposite angle at M (angle PMC) is PC, which is radius r. The side opposite angle at P (angle MPC) is MC. Therefore, MC = PC = r. Hence, since M is the midpoint of AC, AC = 2*MC = 2r. So AC = 2r. Thus, AB = AC = 2r. 

Then, using Pythagoras on triangle PBA: AB² + PB² = PA². So (2r)^2 + r^2 = PA² → 4r² + r² = 5r² = PA² → PA = sqrt(5)r. So the answer would be E. But looking at the choices, option E is r*sqrt(5). So that would be the answer. 

Wait, but let me check again. Because maybe there's something wrong here. Let me make sure that AC is indeed 2r. Because MC = r comes from triangle PMC being isosceles with angles at M and P equal. But is that accurate?

In triangle PMC, angles at M and P are equal. Therefore, sides opposite are equal. Side opposite angle at M is PC. Side opposite angle at P is MC. Therefore, PC = MC. Since PC is radius r, so MC = r. Therefore, AC = 2r. That seems correct. 

Therefore, AB = AC = 2r. Then PA can be calculated via the right triangle PAB. AB is tangent, so PA^2 = AB^2 + PB^2. Which gives PA^2 = (2r)^2 + r^2 = 5r². So PA = r√5. Which corresponds to choice E. But looking back at the options provided:

Choices are A.r + 1, B.2*r, C.r*sqrt(2), D.r*sqrt(3), E.r*sqrt(5)

So E is the answer. But wait, the original problem says that the circle has radius r, so PC is r. So yes, that part holds. But let me think again if there's another way this could be approached.

Alternatively, maybe coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point P at origin (0,0). Let me assume that the circle is centered at P(0,0). Let me suppose that points B and C are points where the tangents touch the circle. Since AB and AC are tangents, and PB is perpendicular to AB, PC perpendicular to AC. Let me assign coordinates such that AB and AC are symmetric. For example, suppose that AB is horizontal and AC is vertical? Wait, no, since angles at B and C are right angles. Maybe better to set up coordinates with P at origin, and AB and AC making some angles.

Alternatively, since AB and AC are tangents from A to circle with center P. Then PA is the line from A to P, and the distance from A to P can be found using the formula for tangent length. The length of tangent from A to circle is sqrt(PA² - r²). But in our case, AB is that tangent, so AB = sqrt(PA² - r²). But earlier, we found AB = 2r. Therefore:

sqrt(PA² - r²) = 2r → PA² - r² = 4r² → PA² = 5r² → PA = r√5. Same result. Therefore, answer is E. 

But why did the problem mention that M is the midpoint of AC and that angles PMC and MPC are equal? Because that led us to find that AC = 2r. Without that information, we couldn't directly find AC. So that condition is essential here. 

Therefore, the answer should be E. But checking the choices again, E is listed as an option. So the correct answer is E.
