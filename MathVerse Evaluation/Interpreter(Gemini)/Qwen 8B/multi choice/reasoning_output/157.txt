MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC where angle C is a right angle. They've given the lengths of sides AC and BC as 4.0 and 3.0 respectively. The question is asking for cosB. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to recall some trigonometry basics here. Since it's a right-angled triangle at C, the other two angles, A and B, must add up to 90 degrees because the total angles in a triangle sum to 180. So angle A + angle B = 90°, making them complementary.

Now, cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is adjacent over hypotenuse. But wait, which angle are we looking at? The question asks for cosB. Let me visualize the triangle. Point C is the right angle, so sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse.

In triangle ABC, angle B is at point B. To find cosB, I need to identify the adjacent side and the hypotenuse relative to angle B. For angle B, the adjacent side would be BC, since it forms one leg of the triangle, and the hypotenuse is AB. Wait, but let me make sure. 

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of cosine in terms of the sides. In a right triangle, for angle B, the adjacent side is BC, the opposite side is AC, and the hypotenuse is AB. Therefore, cosB should be adjacent/hypotenuse, which is BC / AB. 

But first, I need to find the length of AB. Since it's a right-angled triangle, Pythagoras' theorem applies. AC² + BC² = AB². Plugging in the numbers: 4² + 3² = AB² → 16 + 9 = 25. So AB is sqrt(25) = 5. 

So AB is 5 units long. Then, cosB is BC divided by AB, which is 3/5. That simplifies to 3/5. Looking at the answer choices, that's option A. 

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it: sometimes people mix up sine and cosine. Sine of angle B would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is AC/AB = 4/5. Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse, which is BC/AB = 3/5. Yes, that seems right. 

Alternatively, could there be another approach? Maybe using coordinates. Suppose we place point C at the origin (0,0). Then, since AC is 4 units, and angle C is the right angle, point A could be at (0,4) and point B at (3,0). Then, vector BA would go from B(3,0) to A(0,4), which has components (-3,4). The angle at B is between BC and BA. Wait, but calculating the cosine of angle B via vectors might be more complicated. However, using coordinates, the length of BC is 3, AB is 5, so same conclusion. 

Therefore, cosB is 3/5, which corresponds to answer A.
