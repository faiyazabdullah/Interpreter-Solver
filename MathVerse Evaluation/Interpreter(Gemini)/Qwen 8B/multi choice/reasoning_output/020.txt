MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the given information. So, we have a circle with center O, and AB is the diameter. Points C and D are also on the circle. Lines AC, BC, CD, and OD are connected. The measure of angle DOB is 140 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle ACD.

Starting with the given predicates, since AB is the diameter of the circle O, that means O is the midpoint of AB. Also, since A, B, C, D are all points on the circle, OA, OB, OC, OD are all radii. Therefore, OA = OB = OC = OD. 

Given that angle DOB is 140 degrees. Since O is the center, the angle DOB is a central angle, so the arc DB would be equal to that angle. In a circle, the measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. So arc DB is 140 degrees.

Now, looking at point C. Since C is another point on the circle, maybe we can relate arcs involving point C. Let me think about the other given info. There's a mention of angle ACD. That angle is formed by points A, C, D. To find angle ACD, perhaps we need to consider some properties of inscribed angles or use triangle properties.

Let me recall that an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc. Also, if we can find the measure of an arc that relates to angle ACD, that could help. Alternatively, considering triangle ACD, but I'm not sure yet.

Wait, angle ACD is an inscribed angle. Let me see. Point C is on the circumference, so angle ACD would intercept an arc. Which arc? The angle at C between points A and D. So the inscribed angle ACD intercepts arc AD. Wait, no. Let me draw it mentally. If we have points A, C, D on the circle, then angle at C between A and D would intercept arc AD. But depending on where C is located.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find the measure of arc AD first, then use that to find angle ACD.

But how do we find arc AD? Well, we know arc DB is 140 degrees. Maybe we can find other arcs. Since AB is the diameter, the entire semicircle from A to B is 180 degrees. Let me note that.

So, starting from point A, going through B to the opposite side. Now, points C and D are somewhere on the circle. Let me try to figure out the positions. Since angle DOB is 140 degrees, that suggests that D is positioned such that moving from O to D creates that angle with OB. Wait, O is the center, so points D and B are on the circle. The angle between OD and OB is 140 degrees. So, if we imagine the circle with AB as diameter, then O is the midpoint of AB. Let me consider coordinates maybe?

Alternatively, think in terms of arcs. The total circumference is 360 degrees. Since AB is a diameter, the arc AB is 180 degrees. Then, the position of D relative to B can be determined via the central angle. Since angle DOB is 140 degrees, arc BD is 140 degrees. Therefore, arc from B to D along the shorter path is 140 degrees. Wait, but since AB is a straight line (diameter), the arc from A to B is 180 degrees. So, if we go from B to D, which is 140 degrees, then the arc from A to D would be... Let me think. Starting at A, going through B to D. Wait, no. Depending on direction. Let me assume that the points are arranged such that moving clockwise from A to B is 180 degrees, then from B, moving towards D, which is 140 degrees away. So, the arc BD is 140 degrees. Therefore, the arc from A to D would be arc AB + arc BD? No, because if you go from A to B is 180 degrees, then from B to D is another 140 degrees, but that would make the total arc from A to D passing through B as 180+140=320 degrees, which is more than a full circle. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the arc BD is actually part of the circle that doesn't overlap with AB?

Wait, perhaps I should consider the position of D. Since angle DOB is 140 degrees, and O is the center, then the arc from B to D (the minor arc) is 140 degrees. However, since AB is a diameter, the arc AB is 180 degrees. Therefore, if we take the arc from B to D as 140 degrees, then the arc from A to D would depend on the direction. Let me think of the circle divided into arcs. Suppose we have points A and B on the circle with AB as diameter. Then, point D is somewhere on the circle such that the central angle between B and D is 140 degrees. So, starting at B, moving counterclockwise 140 degrees gets us to D. But since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B is 180 degrees. So, if we move from B counterclockwise 140 degrees, that places D in the upper half of the circle (assuming standard orientation). Then, the arc from A to D would be arc AB minus arc BD? Or something like that?

Alternatively, maybe the arc from A to D is 180 degrees minus 140 degrees? Not sure. Let me think again. The entire circle is 360 degrees. The arc AB is 180 degrees. Arc BD is 140 degrees. So, the arc from B to D is 140 degrees. If we want to find the arc from A to D, we can consider the arc from A to B to D. But that would be arc AB plus arc BD. But arc AB is 180 degrees, adding arc BD (140 degrees) gives 320 degrees, which is more than half the circle. That seems incorrect. Wait, maybe the arc BD is actually the major arc? Because if the central angle is 140 degrees, that's less than 180, so it's the minor arc. So, the minor arc BD is 140 degrees, meaning that D is located such that the arc from B to D (shorter way) is 140 degrees. Therefore, the arc from D to A would be... Let me calculate.

Total circle is 360 degrees. The arc from A to B is 180 degrees. The arc from B to D is 140 degrees. So, the arc from D back to A would be 360 - (arc AB + arc BD)? Wait, no. Let me think of the circle as being split into arcs. From A to B is 180 degrees. From B to D is 140 degrees. So, the arc from A to D passing through B is 180 + 140 = 320 degrees. But that's the longer arc. The shorter arc from A to D would be the remaining part. Wait, total circle is 360 degrees. So, the shorter arc from A to D would be 360 - 320 = 40 degrees? Wait, that seems small. Let me check.

If arc AB is 180 degrees, arc BD is 140 degrees. So, if we start at A, go to B (180 degrees), then from B to D (another 140 degrees). But that would make the total arc from A to D via B as 180 + 140 = 320 degrees. Therefore, the other arc from A to D (the minor arc) would be 360 - 320 = 40 degrees. So, arc AD measures 40 degrees. Is that correct? That would mean that the arc from A to D is 40 degrees. 

If that's the case, then angle ACD is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AD. Wait, angle at C intercepting arc AD. Because angle ACD is formed by points A, C, D with vertex at C. So, the inscribed angle ACD would intercept arc AD. Therefore, the measure of angle ACD would be half the measure of arc AD. So, if arc AD is 40 degrees, then angle ACD is 20 degrees. So, the answer would be A:20°. 

But wait, let me confirm this. How do I know that angle ACD intercepts arc AD? Let me recall that an inscribed angle intercepts the arc opposite to it. For example, angle at C between points A and D would intercept arc from A to D that does not contain C. So, if C is located such that when you look at points A and D, the arc that's not containing C is AD. But depends on where C is. 

Wait, but where is point C? The problem says that C is another point on the circle. Are there any constraints on where C is? The given predicates include Line(A,C) and Line(B,C), which are chords. Also, PointLiesOnLine(O,Line(A,B)) indicates that O lies on AB, which we already knew since AB is the diameter. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B)). So, angle ACB is a right angle. 

Ah! Angle ACB is a right angle. Since AB is the diameter, and C is a point on the circle, then triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with AB as diameter. By Thales' theorem, angle ACB is a right angle. So, that tells us that triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Therefore, angle ACB is 90 degrees. 

This is important. So, knowing that, maybe we can find the location of point C. Since AB is the diameter, and C is on the circle, forming a right angle at C. 

Now, going back to angle ACD. Let's think about triangle ACD. We need to find angle at C. 

Earlier, I thought that angle ACD intercepts arc AD, which was calculated as 40 degrees, leading to angle ACD being 20 degrees. But let me verify again. 

First, confirming the arc AD. If arc BD is 140 degrees, arc AB is 180 degrees. Then, arc AD is arc AB minus arc BD? No, because arc BD starts at B and goes to D. Let me think again. The arc from A to D can be found by considering the entire circle. Let's suppose that the arc from B to D is 140 degrees, so that's the central angle. Then, the arc from A to D would be arc AB (which is 180 degrees) minus arc BD? Wait, no. Because if you're going from A to D, depending on direction. Let me imagine the circle with AB horizontal, with A on the left and B on the right. Then, point D is such that angle DOB is 140 degrees. So, from point B, rotating 140 degrees counterclockwise around the center O would place D above the circle. Then, the arc from A to D would be arc from A to B (180 degrees) plus arc from B to D (140 degrees) if going the long way, but the short arc would be the rest. Wait, but the total circle is 360 degrees. So, if arc BD is 140 degrees, and arc AB is 180 degrees, then the arc from A to D directly would be arc AB minus arc BD? Wait, no. Let me think of the circle as follows: starting at A, going counterclockwise through B to D. The arc from A to B is 180 degrees, then from B to D is another 140 degrees, making the arc from A to D (passing through B) as 180 + 140 = 320 degrees. Therefore, the shorter arc from A to D would be 360 - 320 = 40 degrees. So, arc AD is 40 degrees. Thus, the inscribed angle over arc AD would be half of that, which is 20 degrees. Hence, angle ACD is 20 degrees. 

But wait, angle ACD is at point C. So, if arc AD is 40 degrees, then the inscribed angle intercepting that arc would be 20 degrees. Therefore, angle ACD is 20 degrees. That would make answer A. 

However, I need to confirm whether angle ACD indeed intercepts arc AD. Let me visualize again. Points A, C, D on the circle. The angle at C between A and D. So, the inscribed angle ACD intercepts arc AD that does not contain C. But where is point C located? Since angle ACB is 90 degrees, point C is somewhere on the circle such that triangle ABC is right-angled at C. So, C is not overlapping with D. 

Assuming that point C is somewhere on the upper half of the circle (since D is also on the upper half, given angle DOB is 140 degrees). Wait, but if AB is the diameter, then point C can be anywhere except A or B. But since angle ACB is 90 degrees, C is anywhere on the circle except A or B. So, it's possible that C is on one side of AB, say the top half. 

But regardless, the position of C affects which arc is intercepted by angle ACD. However, since we've calculated arc AD as 40 degrees, and assuming that angle ACD intercepts that arc, then yes, angle ACD is half of that. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute this. Let's think about triangle OCD. Since O is the center, and OD and OC are radii. So, triangle COD is an isosceles triangle with OC = OD. The angle at O is angle COD. What is angle COD? 

We know angle DOB is 140 degrees. If we can find angle COB, then angle COD would be angle COB minus angle DOB or something? Wait, let's think. If points C and D are on the circle, then angle COD is the central angle between points C and D. 

But how do we find angle COD? We need to relate it to other known angles. 

Since AB is the diameter, and point C is on the circle, then angle ACB is 90 degrees. Also, since OA and OB are radii, OA = OB = OC = OD. 

Let me think about triangle AOC. Since OA and OC are radii, triangle AOC is isosceles with OA = OC. Similarly for other triangles. 

But maybe focusing on triangle COD. If we can find the measure of angle COD, then we can find arc CD, which might help. 

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me return to the previous conclusion. If arc AD is 40 degrees, then angle ACD is 20 degrees. But is there another way to verify this?

Another approach: Since angle DOB is 140 degrees, and O is the center, then arc BD is 140 degrees. Also, since AB is a diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. Let me try to find arc AD. 

Suppose we consider the entire circle. The sum of arcs AB, BD, DC, and CA equals 360 degrees. Wait, but without knowing where C is, that's hard. 

Alternatively, since angle ACB is 90 degrees, that implies that arc AB is 180 degrees, which we already know. Also, since C is on the circle, arc AC + arc CB = 180 degrees. Wait, no. Because angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB. Wait, angle ACB is 90 degrees, which is half the measure of arc AB. Since arc AB is 180 degrees, that checks out. 

But how does point C relate to arc AD? Maybe I need to find the relationship between arcs involving C and D. 

Alternatively, since we have points A, C, D on the circle, and we need angle ACD. Let me consider drawing triangle ACD. The angle at C. 

Using the Law of Sines in triangle ACD? Hmm, but without knowing sides, that might not help. 

Wait, but since all points are on the circle, maybe there's a cyclic quadrilateral involved. However, unless we know more about the other points, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that angle ACD is an inscribed angle. It's formed by points A-C-D. So, it intercepts arc AD. So, the measure of angle ACD is half the measure of arc AD. Therefore, if I can find arc AD, then divide by two. 

To find arc AD, as earlier, since arc BD is 140 degrees, and arc AB is 180 degrees. Assuming that D is placed such that moving from B to D is 140 degrees counterclockwise. Then, the arc from A to D would be arc AB (180 degrees) minus arc BD (140 degrees)? Wait, no. If you go from A to B to D, that's 180 + 140 = 320 degrees, which is the major arc AD. Therefore, the minor arc AD is 360 - 320 = 40 degrees. Therefore, arc AD is 40 degrees. 

Thus, angle ACD is half of that, which is 20 degrees. 

Therefore, the answer should be A:20°. 

I think this is correct. Let me just check once more. 

Another way: If arc AD is 40 degrees, then the central angle COD is 40 degrees. Wait, no. The central angle corresponding to arc AD is angle AOD. So, angle AOD would be 40 degrees. 

Then, in triangle ACD, angle at C is half of arc AD, which is 20 degrees. Yes. 

Alternatively, if I consider triangle COD. Since OC and OD are radii, triangle COD is isosceles. If angle COD is 40 degrees, then base angles at C and D are (180 - 40)/2 = 70 degrees each. But angle at C in triangle COD is angle OCD. However, angle ACD is different. 

Wait, but angle OCD is part of angle ACD? Or not necessarily. 

Hmm, maybe not directly helpful. 

But if angle ACD is 20 degrees, and angle OCD is 70 degrees, then angle ACD and OCD are parts of some larger angle. 

But I think my initial calculation holds. Given that angle ACD intercepts arc AD of 40 degrees, so it's half that. 

Yes, I think that's solid. So the answer is A.
