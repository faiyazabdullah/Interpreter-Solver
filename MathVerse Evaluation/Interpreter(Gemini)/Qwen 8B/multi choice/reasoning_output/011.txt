MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F. There are several lines connecting these points: Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(A,D), Line(A,E), Line(B,C), Line(D,E), Line(A,F), Line(B,F), Line(C,F). Also, there are triangles mentioned: Triangle(A,B,C) and Triangle(A,D,E). Some angle measures are given: MeasureOf(Angle(C)) is 36 degrees, MeasureOf(Angle(E,A,B)) is 60 degrees. Then there's an intersection point F where Line(A,D) and Line(B,C) meet. It also says that Triangles ABC and ADE are congruent, with some length equalities and angle equalities. Additionally, there's a rotation mentioned: Triangle ABC rotated 60 degrees around A to get ADE. 

The question asks for the measure of angle AFC. The answer choices are A:84°, B:80°, C:60°, D:90°.

First, I should visualize the diagram based on the given information. Since there's a rotation involved, maybe it's helpful to consider how rotating triangle ABC 60 degrees around point A gives triangle ADE. That suggests that AD is the image of AB under this rotation, and AE is the image of AC. So, since rotation preserves distances and angles, AB = AD, AC = AE, and angles like ∠BAD would be 60 degrees because of the rotation. Wait, but the problem states that Equals(LengthOf(A,B), LengthOf(A,D)), so that checks out. Similarly, Equals(LengthOf(A,C), LengthOf(A,E)), which aligns with the rotation preserving lengths.

Also, the measure of Angle(E,A,B) is 60 degrees. Since E is the image of C after rotation, maybe angle EAB is 60 degrees? Because rotating ABC around A by 60 degrees would make angle between AB and AE equal to 60 degrees. But wait, original angle at A in triangle ABC is ∠BAC. After rotation, angle between AB and AD would be 60 degrees, but perhaps angle EAB is different?

Wait, the problem mentions MeasureOf(Angle(E,A,B)) is 60 degrees. So that's angle at point A between points E and B. Which would mean that AE and AB form a 60-degree angle. Given that triangle ADE is a rotation of ABC by 60 degrees around A, then AE corresponds to AC, and AD corresponds to AB. Therefore, the angle between AE and AB would be the same as the angle between AC and AB in the original triangle. Wait, but if we rotate ABC around A by 60 degrees to get ADE, then the direction of AB is rotated to AD, and AC is rotated to AE. So, the angle between AD and AB would be 60 degrees. However, the angle between AE and AB is given as 60 degrees. Hmm, maybe there's something here.

Alternatively, since the rotation is 60 degrees, the angle between AB and AD is 60 degrees. Also, since AE is the image of AC, the angle between AE and AD would relate to the original angle at A in triangle ABC. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the rotation direction. The problem says rotate anticlockwise by 60 degrees. So, starting from triangle ABC, rotating around A anticlockwise by 60 degrees would take AB to AD, and AC to AE. So, the angle between AB and AD is 60 degrees. Also, angle between AC and AE is 60 degrees. But the given measure of angle(E,A,B) is 60 degrees. So, angle at A between E and B is 60 degrees. Let me think: point E is such that AE is the image of AC after rotation. So, if we imagine rotating AC around A by 60 degrees anticlockwise, then AE would be in a new position. Therefore, the angle between AE and AB would depend on the original angle at A in triangle ABC. Wait, but maybe there's more structure here.

Given that triangles ABC and ADE are congruent. So, sides AB=AD, AC=AE, BC=DE. Also, angles correspond. For example, angle at A in triangle ABC (∠BAC) equals angle at A in triangle ADE (∠DAE). But since the rotation is 60 degrees, maybe those angles are related? Or perhaps they are preserved? Wait, rotation preserves angles, so the measure of ∠BAC in triangle ABC is equal to ∠DAE in triangle ADE. But since the rotation is 60 degrees, the orientation changes, but the measure remains the same.

Additionally, there's an intersection point F where lines AD and BC meet. So, line AD intersects line BC at point F. And we need to find the measure of angle AFC.

Now, considering the given angles. We know that angle C (which is ∠ACB) is 36 degrees. Also, angle at EAB (angle E,A,B) is 60 degrees. Also, other angle equalities: MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,E)) is 60 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B)) is 60 degrees. Also, angle CAB equals angle EAD, since triangles ABC and ADE are congruent. Wait, but since they're congruent via rotation, the angles should correspond accordingly.

Let me try to sketch this mentally. Points A, B, C forming triangle ABC. Rotate it 60 degrees around A to get ADE. So, point D is the image of B, and E is the image of C. Therefore, AD = AB, AE = AC, and DE = BC. Also, angle BAD is 60 degrees, as it's the rotation angle. Also, angle CAE is 60 degrees. Now, line AD is the image of AB after rotation, so AD is in a direction 60 degrees from AB. Similarly, AE is 60 degrees from AC.

But we also have that line AD intersects BC at point F. So, point F lies on both AD and BC. Need to find angle AFC.

Let me note down the key angles and relations:

From the given:

- ∠ACB = 36° (given).
- ∠EAB = 60° (given).
- ∠CAE = 60° (from the equality of MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,E)), which is ∠CAE).
- ∠DAB = 60° (since rotation by 60° around A maps AB to AD).
- Triangles ABC ≅ ADE (so corresponding angles are equal).

Since triangles ABC and ADE are congruent, their angles are equal. So, ∠ABC = ∠ADE, ∠ACB = ∠AED, etc. Also, since the rotation is 60°, the angle between AB and AD is 60°, so ∠BAD = 60°, and similarly ∠CAE = 60°.

Now, looking at point F, which is the intersection of AD and BC. So, F lies on AD and BC. Let me try to analyze triangle AFC. To find angle AFC, we need to find the measure of the angle at F between points A, F, and C.

Perhaps using properties of triangles, rotations, and maybe cyclic quadrilaterals or something else. Alternatively, using the fact that certain triangles are congruent or similar.

Another thing given is that ∠CAB equals ∠EAD. Since triangles ABC and ADE are congruent, angle at A in ABC (∠BAC) equals angle at A in ADE (∠DAE). But ∠DAE is made up of ∠DAB + ∠BAE? Wait, no. Wait, point E is obtained by rotating AC 60° around A. So, if we consider the rotation, then vector AC is rotated 60° to become vector AE. Therefore, the angle between AB and AD is 60°, and the angle between AC and AE is 60°, but how does that affect ∠BAC?

Let me denote ∠BAC as x. Then, since triangle ABC has angles summing to 180°, ∠BAC + ∠ABC + ∠ACB = 180°. So, x + ∠ABC + 36° = 180° → ∠ABC = 144° - x. Similarly, in triangle ADE, since it's congruent to ABC, ∠DAE is also x. But ∠DAE is formed by AD and AE. Since AD is obtained by rotating AB 60°, and AE is obtained by rotating AC 60°, then the angle between AD and AE would be... Hmm, perhaps ∠DAE is equal to ∠BAC plus something? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since ∠EAB is given as 60°, which is the angle between EA and AB. Let me consider that. Point E is such that AE is the image of AC after a 60° rotation. So, if we consider the original angle ∠BAC (x), then after rotating AC by 60° around A to get AE, the angle between AB and AE would be ∠BAE = ∠BAC + ∠CAE? Wait, if we rotate AC by 60°, then AE is in a direction that is 60° from AC. Depending on the direction of rotation, but since it's anticlockwise, maybe ∠CAE is 60°, making ∠BAE = ∠BAC + ∠CAE? Wait, if we imagine rotating AC around A by 60° anticlockwise to get AE, then the direction from AC to AE is 60°. So, if originally, AB was in one direction, and AC was another, then after rotation, AE is 60° from AC. So, depending on the initial configuration, the angle between BA and AE could vary. But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(E,A,B)) is 60°, i.e., ∠EAB = 60°. So, regardless of other angles, ∠EAB is fixed at 60°. This seems crucial.

So, ∠EAB = 60°, which is the angle between EA and AB. Also, since AE is the image of AC after a 60° rotation, then the angle between AC and AE is 60°, so ∠CAE = 60°. Therefore, combining these two facts: ∠EAB = ∠CAE + ∠CAB? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw this mentally.

Imagine point A. From A, there are two rays: AB and AC, forming angle ∠BAC = x. Then, rotating AC by 60° anticlockwise around A gives ray AE. So, the angle between AC and AE is 60°, hence ∠CAE = 60°. Now, the angle between AB and AE is given as 60°, which is ∠EAB. So, if we consider AB and AE, the angle between them is 60°, which implies that the angle between AB and AC (which is x) plus the angle between AC and AE (which is 60°) equals the angle between AB and AE. Wait, that would mean x + 60° = 60°, implying x = 0°, which is impossible. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong here.

Alternatively, maybe the rotation causes AE to be positioned such that ∠EAB is 60°, which may involve the original angle ∠BAC. Let me think again. Suppose we have triangle ABC with AB and AC. Rotating AC around A by 60° anticlockwise gives AE. So, AE is a copy of AC rotated 60°. Then, the angle between AB and AE depends on the original angle between AB and AC. Let me consider vectors. Let’s suppose AB is along the positive x-axis, and AC makes an angle x with AB. Rotating AC by 60° anticlockwise would place AE at an angle of x + 60° relative to AB. Therefore, the angle between AB and AE would be x + 60°, but according to the given, this angle is 60°, so x + 60° = 60° ⇒ x = 0°, which isn't possible. Therefore, there's a contradiction unless my understanding is incorrect.

This suggests that my previous assumption about the rotation direction or the correspondence of points might be wrong. Maybe the rotation is clockwise instead of anticlockwise? Wait, the problem says rotate anticlockwise. Alternatively, perhaps the rotation takes AB to AD, not AC to AE? Wait, the problem says "rotate triangle ABC anticlockwise around point A by 60.0 to get triangle AED". So, the entire triangle ABC is rotated around A by 60°, resulting in triangle AED. Therefore, each vertex of ABC is rotated to a corresponding vertex of AED. So, A stays the same, B rotates to D, and C rotates to E. Hence, the rotation takes B to D and C to E. Therefore, the angle between AB and AD is 60°, and the angle between AC and AE is 60°. So, if originally, AB and AC were forming angle x = ∠BAC, then after rotation, AD and AE would form the same angle x, but rotated. However, the angle between AB and AE is given as 60°, which may require some relation between x and the rotation.

Wait, perhaps the rotation moves AB to AD, so the angle between AB and AD is 60°, and AC to AE, so angle between AC and AE is 60°. So, the angle between AB and AD is 60°, and angle between AC and AE is 60°. Now, what is the relationship between AB and AE? Let me think. Since AE is the image of AC after rotation, and AD is the image of AB after rotation. So, if we consider the rotation, then the angle between AD and AE would be the same as the angle between AB and AC, which is x. Because rotation preserves angles. Therefore, ∠DAE = x = ∠BAC. 

Additionally, we have that ∠EAB is given as 60°. How can we express ∠EAB in terms of other angles? Let's consider that ∠EAB is the angle between EA and AB. Since EA is the image of AC after rotation, and AD is the image of AB. Let me try to find ∠EAB. 

Suppose we look at triangle ABE. We know that AE is the image of AC, so AE = AC. Also, AB is unchanged. So, triangle ABE has sides AB, AE, and BE. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, since we have angles involving ∠EAB = 60°, and knowing that ∠CAE = 60°, maybe we can find x.

Let me attempt to write equations. Let me denote ∠BAC = x. Then, since ∠CAE = 60°, and ∠EAB = 60°, then the total angle around point A would be ∠BAC + ∠CAE + ... ? Wait, no. The points B, A, E are arranged such that AB and AE form angle ∠EAB = 60°. Also, AE is obtained by rotating AC by 60°, so the angle between AC and AE is 60°, so ∠CAE = 60°. Therefore, if we look at the angle between AB and AC, which is x, and the angle between AC and AE is 60°, then the angle between AB and AE would be x + 60°, assuming they are on the same side. But the problem states that ∠EAB = 60°, so x + 60° = 60°, leading to x = 0°, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction, suggesting that my assumption about the direction of rotation or the arrangement of points is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the rotation is such that the angle between AB and AD is 60°, and the angle between AC and AE is 60°, but depending on the direction of rotation, these angles could be oriented differently. Perhaps the angle between AB and AE is not x + 60°, but |x - 60°| or something else. Let me think again. 

Assume that AB is pointing to the right, and AC is at an angle x above AB. Rotating AC by 60° anticlockwise around A would move it to a new position AE. Depending on whether the rotation is towards AB or away, the angle between AB and AE could vary. If the rotation is such that AE is on the opposite side of AC relative to AB, then the angle between AB and AE might be x - 60°, or something like that. But without a diagram, it's tricky. However, the problem explicitly states that ∠EAB = 60°, so this must hold true regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps ∠EAB = 60° comes from the rotation. Since triangle ABC is rotated by 60° around A to get ADE, then the image of point B is D, and the image of point C is E. So, the angle between AB and AD is 60°, and the angle between AC and AE is 60°. Now, what's the angle between AE and AB? Let's see. If we imagine AB and AD being separated by 60°, and AE being a rotation of AC, which is connected to AB via angle x. 

Maybe using vector math would help. Let me assign coordinates. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Let me assume AB is along the x-axis, so point B is at (b, 0) for some b > 0. Point C is somewhere in the plane; let's say its coordinates are (c_x, c_y). The angle at A, ∠BAC, is x. When we rotate triangle ABC around A by 60° anticlockwise, point B (which is at (b, 0)) rotates to D. The rotation matrix for 60° anticlockwise is:

[cosθ  -sinθ]
[sinθ   cosθ]

For θ = 60°, cosθ = 0.5, sinθ = (√3)/2. So, applying this to point B (b, 0):

D_x = b*cosθ - 0*sinθ = b*(0.5)
D_y = b*sinθ + 0*cosθ = b*(√3/2)

Therefore, point D is at (b/2, (b√3)/2).

Similarly, rotating point C (c_x, c_y) around A by 60° gives point E. The coordinates of E would be:

E_x = c_x * 0.5 - c_y * (√3/2)
E_y = c_x * (√3/2) + c_y * 0.5

Now, the angle ∠EAB is the angle between vectors AB and AE. Vector AB is (b, 0), and vector AE is (E_x, E_y). The angle between AB and AE can be found using the dot product:

cos(angle_EAB) = (AB · AE) / (|AB| |AE|)

Compute AB · AE = b*E_x + 0*E_y = b*E_x

|AB| = sqrt(b² + 0²) = b

|AE| = sqrt(E_x² + E_y²) = sqrt( (c_x^2 + c_y^2) ) because rotation preserves distance. Since AC has length sqrt(c_x² + c_y²), so |AE| = |AC|. Let's denote |AC| as l.

Thus,

cos(angle_EAB) = [b * E_x] / (b * l) = E_x / l

But E_x is (c_x * 0.5 - c_y * (√3/2)). So:

cos(angle_EAB) = [0.5 c_x - (√3/2)c_y]/l

But l is the length of AC, which is sqrt(c_x² + c_y²). So, this expression represents the cosine of angle EAB, which is given as 60°, so cos(60°) = 0.5.

Thus:

[0.5 c_x - (√3/2)c_y]/sqrt(c_x² + c_y²) = 0.5

Multiply both sides by sqrt(c_x² + c_y²):

0.5 c_x - (√3/2)c_y = 0.5 sqrt(c_x² + c_y²)

Square both sides to eliminate square root:

(0.5 c_x - (√3/2)c_y)^2 = (0.5)^2 (c_x² + c_y²)

Expand left side:

(0.25 c_x²) - 2*(0.5)*(√3/2)*c_x*c_y + (3/4)c_y² = 0.25 (c_x² + c_y²)

Simplify left side:

0.25 c_x² - (√3/2)c_x c_y + 0.75 c_y²

Right side:

0.25 c_x² + 0.25 c_y²

Subtract right side from both sides:

Left - Right = [0.25c_x² - √3/2 c_x c_y + 0.75c_y²] - [0.25c_x² + 0.25c_y²] = (-√3/2 c_x c_y) + 0.5c_y² = 0

Thus:

-√3/2 c_x c_y + 0.5 c_y² = 0

Factor out c_y:

c_y (-√3/2 c_x + 0.5 c_y) = 0

So either c_y = 0 or -√3/2 c_x + 0.5 c_y = 0.

Case 1: c_y = 0. Then point C is on the x-axis. But then triangle ABC would have points A(0,0), B(b,0), C(c_x,0), which would be colinear, making it degenerate. So this case is invalid.

Case 2: -√3/2 c_x + 0.5 c_y = 0 → rearranged:

0.5 c_y = (√3/2) c_x → c_y = √3 c_x

So, the y-coordinate of point C is √3 times its x-coordinate. Thus, the slope of AC is (√3 c_x)/c_x = √3, which means angle between AC and the x-axis is arctan(√3) = 60°. Therefore, the angle between AB (along x-axis) and AC is 60°, so ∠BAC = 60°. Wait, this is interesting! So, this implies that ∠BAC is 60°, which contradicts earlier thoughts but seems to be forced by the condition that ∠EAB = 60°. 

Therefore, ∠BAC = 60°. Now, going back to triangle ABC, we know that ∠ACB = 36°, and ∠BAC = 60°, so the third angle ∠ABC = 180° - 60° - 36° = 84°. 

So, ∠ABC = 84°, ∠BAC = 60°, ∠ACB = 36°.

Now, since triangles ABC and ADE are congruent, triangle ADE has the same angles: ∠DAE = 60°, ∠ADE = 84°, ∠AED = 36°. 

Now, since AD is the image of AB after a 60° rotation, and AE is the image of AC after a 60° rotation. Also, line AD intersects line BC at point F. We need to find angle AFC.

Let me recall that in triangle ABC, point F is the intersection of AD and BC. So, F lies on BC and AD. To find angle AFC, we need to analyze triangle AFC.

Let me consider using Ceva's theorem or Menelaus' theorem, or maybe coordinate geometry. Alternatively, since we know angles in the triangles, maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines.

Alternatively, since we've determined that ∠BAC = 60°, ∠ABC = 84°, ∠ACB = 36°, and we know that AD is a rotation of AB by 60°, so AD makes a 60° angle with AB. Let me try to find coordinates of points to calculate the angle.

Earlier, I had set up coordinates with A at (0,0), B at (b,0), and since ∠BAC = 60°, point C lies along the line making 60° with AB. Since ∠BAC is 60°, and AC has length l, then coordinates of C can be expressed as (l cos 60°, l sin 60°) = (0.5l, (√3/2)l). 

Let me choose specific values for simplicity. Let me set AB = 1 unit, so b = 1. Then, coordinates:

A: (0, 0)
B: (1, 0)
C: (0.5l, (√3/2)l)

But we also know that ∠ACB = 36°. Let me compute l using the Law of Sines in triangle ABC.

In triangle ABC:

∠BAC = 60°, ∠ABC = 84°, ∠ACB = 36°

Law of Sines: AB/sin(∠ACB) = AC/sin(∠ABC) = BC/sin(∠BAC)

So, AB / sin(36°) = AC / sin(84°)

AB is 1, so:

1 / sin(36°) = AC / sin(84°) → AC = sin(84°)/sin(36°)

Calculate numerical values:

sin(84°) ≈ 0.9952
sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878

So AC ≈ 0.9952 / 0.5878 ≈ 1.693

So, AC ≈ 1.693 units. Let me keep it symbolic for now. Let's denote AC = k = sin(84°)/sin(36°)

Then, coordinates of C are (k * cos(60°), k * sin(60°)) = (k * 0.5, k * (√3/2))

Now, point D is the image of B after a 60° rotation around A. Earlier calculation gave D as (b/2, (b√3)/2). With b=1, D is (0.5, √3/2).

Point E is the image of C after a 60° rotation. Using the rotation formula:

E_x = c_x * 0.5 - c_y * (√3/2)
E_y = c_x * (√3/2) + c_y * 0.5

Plugging in c_x = 0.5k, c_y = (√3/2)k:

E_x = (0.5k)(0.5) - ((√3/2)k)(√3/2) = 0.25k - (3/4)k = -0.5k
E_y = (0.5k)(√3/2) + ((√3/2)k)(0.5) = (√3/4)k + (√3/4)k = (√3/2)k

So, coordinates of E are (-0.5k, (√3/2)k)

Now, line AD connects A(0,0) to D(0.5, √3/2). Line BC connects B(1,0) to C(0.5k, (√3/2)k). Find their intersection F.

Parametrize line AD: from (0,0) to (0.5, √3/2). Parametric equations: x = 0.5t, y = (√3/2)t, where t ∈ [0,1].

Parametrize line BC: from B(1,0) to C(0.5k, (√3/2)k). Let parameter s go from 0 to 1.

Parametric equations for BC:

x = 1 + s*(0.5k - 1)
y = 0 + s*((√3/2)k - 0) = s*(√3/2)k

Find t and s where these meet:

Set x and y equal:

0.5t = 1 + s*(0.5k - 1)
(√3/2)t = s*(√3/2)k

From the second equation:

(√3/2)t = s*(√3/2)k → divide both sides by √3/2:

t = s*k

Substitute t = sk into first equation:

0.5sk = 1 + s*(0.5k - 1)

Rearrange:

0.5sk - s*(0.5k - 1) = 1

Factor s:

s[0.5k - 0.5k + 1] = 1 → s[1] = 1 → s = 1

Then t = sk = 1 * k = k

So, point F is on AD at t=k. But t ranges from 0 to 1 for AD, but k is approximately 1.693, which is greater than 1. So, this suggests that F lies beyond point D on line AD extended. Wait, but the problem statement says that AD and BC intersect at F. So, even if t exceeds 1, it's still valid as long as the lines extend infinitely.

So, coordinates of F are:

x = 0.5t = 0.5k
y = (√3/2)t = (√3/2)k

Wait, but substituting t = k, so F is (0.5k, (√3/2)k). Wait, but that's the same as point C's coordinates? No, point C is (0.5k, (√3/2)k)? Wait, earlier we said that point C is at (0.5k, (√3/2)k). Wait, but that would mean that point F coincides with point C? That can't be right, because line BC connects B to C, and line AD goes from A to D. Their intersection would be F. But according to this parametrization, when s=1, we reach point C. But if t = k, then F is at (0.5k, (√3/2)k), which is point C. But that would imply that line BC intersects AD at point C, but point C is on line BC, so that would mean that line AD passes through C. But that's not necessarily true unless D is chosen such that AD passes through C, which may not be the case. 

Wait, there must be a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again. 

From the parametric equations:

We had for line AD: x = 0.5t, y = (√3/2)t

For line BC: x = 1 + s*(0.5k - 1), y = s*(√3/2)k

Setting them equal:

0.5t = 1 + s*(0.5k - 1)
(√3/2)t = s*(√3/2)k

From the second equation, dividing both sides by √3/2 gives t = s*k

Substituting into the first equation:

0.5*(s*k) = 1 + s*(0.5k - 1)

Expanding:

0.5sk = 1 + 0.5sk - s

Subtract 0.5sk from both sides:

0 = 1 - s → s = 1

So, s=1, which gives us point C on line BC, and t = k. Therefore, this suggests that line AD intersects BC at point C. But that would mean F=C. But that can't be correct because the problem states that F is the intersection of AD and BC, implying F is distinct from C. Where is the error here?

Ah, perhaps my assumption that AB=1 and AC=k leads to inconsistency. Let me double-check the coordinates.

Wait, when we computed the coordinates of E, we used the rotation of point C. But if point C is located at (0.5k, (√3/2)k), then rotating it around A by 60° gives E(-0.5k, (√3/2)k). But then line AD goes from A(0,0) to D(0.5, √3/2). Line BC goes from B(1,0) to C(0.5k, (√3/2)k). Solving their intersection gives s=1, t=k, which places F at point C. This suggests that AD passes through C, which would mean that line AD passes through C, implying that D lies on the line AC extended. But D is supposed to be the image of B after rotation, so unless the rotation brings B to a point on AC, which would require specific conditions. 

However, this seems contradictory. Perhaps there's an error in the earlier assumption that ∠BAC = 60°? Let me revisit that. Earlier, when we derived that ∠BAC = 60°, it came from the condition that ∠EAB = 60°, which led us to conclude that the y-coordinate of C is √3 times the x-coordinate, making ∠BAC = 60°. But this seems to lead to a contradiction in the intersection point. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the parametric equations. Let me re-examine the calculation of point E. 

Point C has coordinates (0.5k, (√3/2)k). Applying the rotation matrix for 60° to this point:

E_x = 0.5k * cos(60°) - (√3/2)k * sin(60°)
E_y = 0.5k * sin(60°) + (√3/2)k * cos(60°)

Calculating cos(60°)=0.5, sin(60°)=√3/2:

E_x = 0.5k * 0.5 - (√3/2)k * (√3/2) = 0.25k - (3/4)k = -0.5k
E_y = 0.5k * (√3/2) + (√3/2)k * 0.5 = (√3/4)k + (√3/4)k = √3/2 * k

So E is at (-0.5k, √3/2 k). 

Now, line AD is from A(0,0) to D(0.5, √3/2). Line BC is from B(1,0) to C(0.5k, √3/2 k). 

To find their intersection, we can parametrize both lines.

Line AD: parametric equations with parameter t: 
x = 0.5t, y = (√3/2)t

Line BC: parametric equations with parameter s:
x = 1 + s*(0.5k - 1)
y = 0 + s*(√3/2 k)

Setting equal:

0.5t = 1 + s*(0.5k - 1) --> Equation (1)
(√3/2)t = s*(√3/2)k --> Equation (2)

From Equation (2): Divide both sides by √3/2:

t = s*k → s = t/k

Substitute into Equation (1):

0.5t = 1 + (t/k)(0.5k - 1)  
0.5t = 1 + t*(0.5 - 1/k)  
Rearranging:

0.5t - t*(0.5 - 1/k) = 1  
0.5t - 0.5t + t/k = 1  
t/k = 1 → t = k

So, t = k, which means point F is at (0.5k, (√3/2)k), which is exactly the coordinates of point C. This implies that F is point C, which contradicts the problem statement that F is the intersection of AD and BC. This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in the assumptions made, likely due to the earlier conclusion that ∠BAC = 60°, which might be incorrect.

Wait, but earlier derivation suggested that ∠BAC = 60°, but this leads to F coinciding with C. This must mean that there's an error in that derivation. Let me revisit that part.

We had earlier that from the condition ∠EAB = 60°, we derived that the y-coordinate of C is √3 times the x-coordinate, leading to ∠BAC = 60°. But this seems to cause contradictions. Perhaps the error lies in assuming that the rotation of AC gives AE such that ∠EAB = 60°, but in reality, with the current setup, this leads to F being C, which is not intended. This suggests that the earlier assumption might be wrong, or perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Alternative approach: Let's forget coordinates and focus on angle chasing. 

Given that triangles ABC and ADE are congruent, with AB=AD, AC=AE, and ∠BAC = ∠DAE. Also, since the rotation is 60°, ∠BAD = 60°, and ∠CAE = 60°. 

We also know that ∠EAB = 60°, which is the angle between EA and AB. Let me consider triangle ABE. In this triangle, we know that AE = AC, AB is a side, and ∠EAB = 60°. If we can find other sides or angles, maybe we can derive relationships.

But since we also know that ∠BAC = x, and ∠CAE = 60°, then ∠EAB = ∠BAC + ∠CAE or |∠BAC - ∠CAE|, depending on the orientation. Assuming that the rotation is such that AE is on one side of AB, then ∠EAB = ∠BAC + ∠CAE. But given that ∠EAB = 60°, this would give x + 60° = 60° → x = 0°, which is impossible. Alternatively, if ∠EAB = |∠BAC - ∠CAE|, then if ∠CAE = 60°, and ∠EAB = 60°, then x = 0° or 120°, but x cannot be 0°. If x = 120°, then ∠BAC = 120°, which is possible.

Let me explore this possibility. Assume ∠BAC = 120°, then ∠EAB = |120° - 60°| = 60°, which fits the given condition. This makes sense!

So, this suggests that ∠BAC = 120°, and thus ∠EAB = 60°, as required. This resolves the earlier contradiction. 

So, revisiting the triangle ABC: ∠BAC = 120°, ∠ACB = 36°, so ∠ABC = 180° - 120° - 36° = 24°. 

Wait, but earlier I thought ∠BAC was 60°, but now it's 120°. This changes things. Let me verify this.

If ∠BAC = 120°, then ∠CAE = 60°, and since AE is obtained by rotating AC by 60°, then ∠EAB = ∠BAC - ∠CAE = 120° - 60° = 60°, which matches the given condition. Great, this fixes the issue. 

So, correcting earlier mistakes: ∠BAC = 120°, ∠ABC = 24°, ∠ACB = 36°. 

Now, with this correction, let's proceed. 

Now, since triangles ABC and ADE are congruent, ∠DAE = ∠BAC = 120°, and ∠ADE = ∠ABC = 24°, ∠AED = ∠ACB = 36°.

Now, we need to find angle AFC, where F is the intersection of AD and BC.

Let me try to analyze triangle AFC. To do this, perhaps we can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in various triangles, or look for similar triangles, or use the concept of Ceva's theorem.

First, let's consider triangle ABC with ∠BAC = 120°, ∠ABC = 24°, ∠ACB = 36°. Let's denote AB = AD = c, AC = AE = b, BC = DE = a. 

Using the Law of Sines in triangle ABC:

a / sin(∠BAC) = b / sin(∠ABC) = c / sin(∠ACB)

So:

a / sin(120°) = b / sin(24°) = c / sin(36°)

Let me compute ratios:

Let's assume AB = c = 1. Then, from the Law of Sines:

a = sin(120°) / sin(36°) * c = (sin(120°)/sin(36°)) * 1 ≈ (0.8660 / 0.5878) ≈ 1.471

And b = sin(24°)/sin(36°) * c ≈ (0.4067 / 0.5878) ≈ 0.691

So, AB = 1, AC ≈ 0.691, BC ≈ 1.471.

Now, AD = AB = 1, AE = AC ≈ 0.691.

Now, let's consider line AD and BC intersecting at F. We need to find angle AFC.

Let me consider using mass point geometry or coordinate geometry again, but with corrected angles.

Let me place point A at (0,0), AB along x-axis, so B is at (1,0). Point C is somewhere in the plane. Given ∠BAC = 120°, and AC ≈ 0.691, so coordinates of C can be determined.

Let me calculate coordinates of C. Since ∠BAC = 120°, and AC = b ≈ 0.691. Using polar coordinates, C is at (b*cos(120°), b*sin(120°)).

cos(120°) = cos(180°-60°) = -cos(60°) = -0.5

sin(120°) = sin(180°-60°) = sin(60°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660

Thus, coordinates of C are:

x = b * (-0.5) ≈ 0.691 * (-0.5) ≈ -0.3455

y = b * (√3/2) ≈ 0.691 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.600

So, C is approximately at (-0.3455, 0.600)

Now, point D is the image of B after a 60° rotation around A. As before, rotating B(1,0) 60° anticlockwise around A(0,0) gives D. Using rotation matrix:

D_x = 1 * cos(60°) - 0 * sin(60°) = 0.5

D_y = 1 * sin(60°) + 0 * cos(60°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.866

So, D is at (0.5, 0.866)

Now, line AD is from A(0,0) to D(0.5, 0.866). Line BC is from B(1,0) to C(-0.3455, 0.600). Let's find their intersection F.

Parametrize line AD: x = 0.5t, y = 0.866t, t ∈ [0,1]

Parametrize line BC: from B(1,0) to C(-0.3455, 0.600). Let parameter s ∈ [0,1]:

x = 1 + s*(-0.3455 - 1) = 1 - s*(1.3455)

y = 0 + s*(0.600 - 0) = 0.600s

Set equal:

0.5t = 1 - 1.3455s  ...(1)

0.866t = 0.600s       ...(2)

From equation (2): t = (0.600 / 0.866)s ≈ (0.600 / 0.866)s ≈ 0.692s

Substitute into equation (1):

0.5*(0.692s) = 1 - 1.3455s → 0.346s + 1.3455s = 1 → 1.6915s = 1 → s ≈ 1 / 1.6915 ≈ 0.591

Then t ≈ 0.692 * 0.591 ≈ 0.409

So, coordinates of F are:

x = 0.5t ≈ 0.5 * 0.409 ≈ 0.2045

y = 0.866t ≈ 0.866 * 0.409 ≈ 0.354

Now, we need to find angle AFC. Point A is (0,0), F is (0.2045, 0.354), and C is (-0.3455, 0.600). Wait, no: angle AFC is the angle at F between points A, F, and C. Wait, no: angle AFC is the angle at F between points A, F, and C? No, angle AFC is the angle at point F between points A, F, and C. Wait, no: the notation ∠AFC means the angle at point F between points A, F, C. Wait, no: standard notation is ∠AFC is the angle at point F between points A, F, C. Wait, no: the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠AFC is the angle at F between points A, F, C. Wait, no: ∠AFC is the angle at point F, with segments FA and FC. Wait, no: the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠AFC is the angle at point F between points A, F, and C. Yes.

So, to find ∠AFC, we need to calculate the angle at F between points A and C. To do this, we can use vectors. Compute vectors FA and FC, then find the angle between them.

Coordinates:

F: (0.2045, 0.354)

A: (0, 0)

C: (-0.3455, 0.600)

Vector FA = A - F = (0 - 0.2045, 0 - 0.354) = (-0.2045, -0.354)

Vector FC = C - F = (-0.3455 - 0.2045, 0.600 - 0.354) = (-0.55, 0.246)

Now, the angle between vectors FA and FC is ∠AFC.

Using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (FA • FC) / (|FA| |FC|)

First, compute FA • FC:

(-0.2045)(-0.55) + (-0.354)(0.246) = 0.112475 - 0.086964 = 0.025511

Next, compute |FA|:

|FA| = sqrt((-0.2045)^2 + (-0.354)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0418 + 0.1253) ≈ sqrt(0.1671) ≈ 0.4087

Compute |FC|:

|FC| = sqrt((-0.55)^2 + (0.246)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.3025 + 0.0605) ≈ sqrt(0.363) ≈ 0.6025

Thus, cos(theta) ≈ 0.025511 / (0.4087 * 0.6025) ≈ 0.025511 / 0.2463 ≈ 0.1036

So theta ≈ arccos(0.1036) ≈ 84°

This matches one of the answer choices: A:84°. 

But wait, let me verify this calculation more precisely. Let me recalculate the dot product and magnitudes with more precise numbers.

First, let me redo the coordinates with higher precision.

Earlier, we approximated:

- Coordinates of C: x ≈ -0.3455, y ≈ 0.600

But let's calculate it more accurately. Given that AC = b = sin(24°)/sin(36°) when AB=1. Let me calculate b:

sin(24°) ≈ 0.406736643

sin(36°) ≈ 0.587785252

So, b ≈ 0.406736643 / 0.587785252 ≈ 0.691577

So, AC = b ≈ 0.691577

Coordinates of C: (b*cos(120°), b*sin(120°)) = (0.691577 * cos(120°), 0.691577 * sin(120°))

cos(120°) = -0.5, sin(120°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660254

So:

x_C = 0.691577 * (-0.5) ≈ -0.3457885

y_C = 0.691577 * 0.8660254 ≈ 0.691577 * 0.8660254 ≈ 0.600000 (approximately)

So, C is at (-0.3457885, 0.600000)

Point D is at (0.5, √3/2) ≈ (0.5, 0.8660254)

Line AD: from (0,0) to (0.5, 0.8660254). Parametric equations: x = 0.5t, y = 0.8660254t

Line BC: from B(1,0) to C(-0.3457885, 0.600000). Let's parameterize with parameter s:

x = 1 + s*(-0.3457885 - 1) = 1 - s*(1.3457885)

y = 0 + s*(0.600000 - 0) = 0.600000s

Set equal to AD:

0.5t = 1 - 1.3457885s ...(1)

0.8660254t = 0.600000s ...(2)

From (2): t = (0.600000 / 0.8660254)s ≈ 0.6928203s

Substitute into (1):

0.5 * 0.6928203s = 1 - 1.3457885s

0.34641015s + 1.3457885s = 1

1.6922s = 1 → s ≈ 1 / 1.6922 ≈ 0.5910

Then t ≈ 0.6928203 * 0.5910 ≈ 0.4096

So, coordinates of F:

x = 0.5t ≈ 0.5 * 0.4096 ≈ 0.2048

y = 0.8660254 * 0.4096 ≈ 0.3547

Now, vectors FA and FC:

FA = A - F = (0 - 0.2048, 0 - 0.3547) = (-0.2048, -0.3547)

FC = C - F = (-0.3457885 - 0.2048, 0.600000 - 0.3547) = (-0.5505885, 0.2453)

Dot product FA • FC = (-0.2048)(-0.5505885) + (-0.3547)(0.2453)

First term: 0.2048 * 0.5505885 ≈ 0.1127

Second term: -0.3547 * 0.2453 ≈ -0.0869

Total ≈ 0.1127 - 0.0869 = 0.0258

Magnitude of FA: sqrt((-0.2048)^2 + (-0.3547)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.0419 + 0.1258) ≈ sqrt(0.1677) ≈ 0.4095

Magnitude of FC: sqrt((-0.5505885)^2 + (0.2453)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.3032 + 0.0602) ≈ sqrt(0.3634) ≈ 0.6028

Thus, cos(theta) = 0.0258 / (0.4095 * 0.6028) ≈ 0.0258 / 0.2468 ≈ 0.1045

theta ≈ arccos(0.1045) ≈ 84.1 degrees.

This aligns closely with choice A: 84°. 

Therefore, the measure of angle AFC is approximately 84°, which corresponds to answer choice A.
