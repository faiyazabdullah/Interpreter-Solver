QUESTION:
There is a parallelogram with two sides 20 and 12 cm. Find its perimeter. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.

CHOICES:
A:60
B:62
C:64
D:66

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the perimeter of a parallelogram with sides 20 cm and 12 cm. Wait, the problem says there's a parallelogram with two sides 20 and 12 cm. So first, I remember that in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length. That means if one pair of sides is 20 cm, the opposite side is also 20 cm, and the other pair is 12 cm each. 

So the perimeter would be the sum of all sides. Let me think. For a parallelogram, the formula for perimeter is 2 times (length + width). Because there are two pairs of equal sides. So substituting the given values, it should be 2*(20 + 12). Let me calculate that. 20 plus 12 is 32, multiplied by 2 gives 64. Hmm, so the perimeter should be 64 cm. 

Wait, but the answer choices include 64 as option C. But wait, the problem mentions an angle of 60 degrees. Does that affect anything? Oh, maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, does the angle matter for the perimeter? No, because the perimeter only depends on the lengths of the sides, not the angles. Even though the angle is given, it doesn't influence the perimeter calculation. So my initial thought was correct. 

But let me double-check. Maybe there's a trick here. Like, could the sides be adjacent sides? Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent sides are different. Wait, but the problem states that Side1 and Side2 are sides of the parallelogram. Since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So if they give two sides as 20 and 12, those are adjacent sides. Therefore, the perimeter is 2*(20+12) = 64. So the answer should be C. 

Looking at the options, yes, 64 is option C. So the correct answer is C. I don't think the angle affects this since perimeter is just sum of all sides. So even if the angle is 60 degrees, it's irrelevant here. Therefore, the perimeter is 64 cm.
