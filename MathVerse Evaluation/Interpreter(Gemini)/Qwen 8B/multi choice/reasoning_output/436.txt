MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is about finding the equation of a hyperbola given certain conditions. Let me start by recalling what I know about hyperbolas and their equations.

Hyperbolas have two standard forms depending on their orientation. Since the problem mentions asymptotes like y = (4/5)x and y = -(4/5)x, which are straight lines passing through the origin, this suggests that the hyperbola is centered at the origin. Also, the asymptotes' slopes are 4/5 and -4/5, so the hyperbola is likely oriented such that its transverse axis is along the x-axis or y-axis. But wait, the asymptotes for a standard hyperbola centered at the origin are usually y = ±(b/a)x if it's horizontal or y = ±(a/b)x if vertical. Wait, but here the slopes are 4/5, so maybe the hyperbola is horizontal? Let me think.

But first, the problem states that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4. That means the points where the hyperbola crosses the y-axis are (0, -4) and (0, 4). For a hyperbola, typically, if it's horizontal, it doesn't cross the y-axis unless it's a vertical hyperbola? Wait, no. Actually, hyperbolas can intersect both axes depending on their orientation. Wait, maybe I should recall the general form of a hyperbola.

The standard form for a hyperbola centered at (h, k) is either ((x-h)^2)/a^2 - ((y-k)^2)/b^2 = 1 (horizontal) or ((y-k)^2)/b^2 - ((x-h)^2)/a^2 = 1 (vertical). In this case, since the center seems to be at the origin because the asymptotes pass through the origin and the intersection points with the y-axis are symmetric around the origin. So the center is probably at (0,0).

Given that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at (0,4) and (0,-4), these points lie on the hyperbola. Plugging x=0 into the equation of the hyperbola, we get y-values. For example, if the hyperbola is horizontal, then plugging x=0 would give ((0)^2)/a^2 - ((y)^2)/b^2 = 1 → -y²/b² = 1 → y² = -b², which isn't possible. Therefore, that implies the hyperbola must be vertical. Because for a vertical hyperbola, the equation is ((y - k)^2)/b² - ((x - h)^2)/a² = 1. If centered at (0,0), then ((y)^2)/b² - ((x)^2)/a² = 1. Then plugging x=0 gives y² / b² = 1 → y = ±b. But according to the problem, the y-intercepts are at ±4, so that would mean b = 4. However, the asymptotes of a vertical hyperbola are y = ±(b/a)x. Here, the asymptotes are y = ±(4/5)x, so comparing, (b/a) = 4/5. Since b is 4, then a = 5. 

Wait, but let's check. If the hyperbola is vertical, then asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x. Given that the asymptotes are y = ±(4/5)x, then b/a = 4/5. If b = 4, then a = 5. Therefore, the equation would be y² / 16 - x² / 25 = 1. But wait, let me confirm the intercepts. When x=0, the equation becomes y² /16 =1 → y=±4, which matches the given y-intercepts. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, if the hyperbola were horizontal, then the asymptotes would be y = ±(b/a)x, and the y-intercepts would require that when x=0, the equation allows y-values. But for a horizontal hyperbola, plugging x=0 would lead to ((y)^2)/b² - ((0)^2)/a² = 1 → y²/b² = 1 → y = ±b. So same as before. Wait, but then if it's horizontal, the asymptotes would still be y = ±(b/a)x. However, the y-intercepts would be ±b. But in this case, the problem says the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, so those points would be (0,4) and (0,-4), which would imply that b = 4. Then, if the asymptotes are y = ±(4/5)x, then (b/a)=4/5 → a=5. But then the equation would be x² /25 - y² /16 =1. However, plugging x=0 into this equation would give -y²/16 =1 → y²=-16, which is impossible. Hence, this contradicts the existence of real y-intercepts. Therefore, the hyperbola cannot be horizontal. Thus, it must be vertical, leading to the equation y² /16 - x² /25 =1.

But wait, there's another part of the problem mentioning a rectangle tangent to the hyperbola. How does that affect things? The problem states that there is a green rectangular tangent to the hyperbola. Maybe this helps confirm the orientation or other parameters. Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is related to the asymptotes or something else. Let me think again.

The asymptotes are given as y = (4/5)x and y = -(4/5)x. These are straight lines through the origin. The hyperbola is tangent to a rectangle. However, without more details about the rectangle, maybe this information isn't directly used except for confirming the slope of the asymptotes. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is formed by the asymptotes and some other lines? Not sure. But since the main constraints are the y-intercepts and the asymptotes, which already define the hyperbola uniquely, perhaps that's sufficient.

Another point: the problem mentions that the hyperbola has double arrows, which might refer to the asymptotes, but that's already covered. The asymptotes are given, so their slopes are fixed. Thus, combining the y-intercepts and the asymptotes' slopes, the equation is determined as y² /16 - x² /25 =1.

Wait, but let me check the ratio given in the problem. There's a ratio of LengthOf(Line(O,A)) to LengthOf(Line(O,B)) equals RatioOf(4,5). Wait, O is the origin, A and B are points where the hyperbola intersects the line y=x? Or maybe another line? Wait, looking back at the predicates:

In the given predicates, there's an IntersectAt(Hyperbola, Line(y,x), Point(A)) and similarly for Point(B). So Line(y,x) is the line connecting points y and x. Wait, but earlier there's a Line(x,y) and Line(y,x), which are the same line. So Line(y,x) is the same as Line(x,y). So the hyperbola intersects the line y=x at points A and B. Wait, but the problem says that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4. Wait, but the line y=x is different from the y-axis. So the points A and B are intersections of the hyperbola with the line y=x. Additionally, the problem mentions that OA and OB have lengths 4 and 4? Wait, no. Let me check the given predicates:

There's Equals(4,LengthOf(Line(O,A))) and Equals(4,LengthOf(Line(O,B))). Wait, but that would suggest that OA and OB are both length 4. However, if points A and B are on the line y=x, then their coordinates would be (a,a) and (b,b). The distance from O to A would be sqrt(a² + a²) = |a|√2. So if this equals 4, then |a|√2 =4 → |a|=4/√2 = 2√2. So points A and B would be (2√2, 2√2) and (-2√2, -2√2). But then the ratio of OA to OB is 1, but the problem also gives a ratio of 4/5. Wait, there's another ratio mentioned: Equals(RatioOf(4,5),RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(O,A)),LengthOf(Line(O,B)))). Wait, but if OA and OB are both length 4, then their ratio is 1. This seems contradictory. Hmm, perhaps I misread the predicates.

Looking back at the user-provided predicates, there's:

Equals(RatioOf(4,5),RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(O,A)),LengthOf(Line(O,B))))
and 
Equals(RatioOf(Sub(0,4),5),RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(O,B)),LengthOf(Line(O,A))))

So the ratio of OA to OB is 4/5, and the ratio of OB to OA is -4/5? Wait, Sub(0,4) is -4, so RatioOf(-4,5) equals RatioOf(LengthOf(OB), LengthOf(OA))? Wait, but ratios are positive quantities, so maybe absolute values are considered? Or maybe the signs indicate direction?

This suggests that the lengths are different. Let me parse this again. Suppose LengthOf(OA) = 4, and LengthOf(OB) = ?

Wait, the first equality says RatioOf(4,5) equals RatioOf(LengthOf(OA), LengthOf(OB)). So 4/5 = OA/OB → OA = (4/5)OB. The second equality says RatioOf(Sub(0,4),5) equals RatioOf(LengthOf(OB), LengthOf(OA)). Sub(0,4) is -4, so RatioOf(-4,5) equals OB/OA. But ratios are usually positive, so maybe they take absolute values. So |-4|/5 = 4/5 equals OB/OA. Which would imply OB/OA = 4/5, hence OA/OB = 5/4. But this conflicts with the first equation. Wait, this suggests inconsistency unless there's a mistake in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the RatioOf function takes signed values. If so, then RatioOf(-4,5) would be negative. But how can the ratio of lengths be negative? Unless the problem considers directed segments or vectors. However, in standard geometry, lengths are positive. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the predicates.

Wait, let's re-examine the original problem statement. It says: "There is a hyperbola... intersects with y-axis at -4 and 4." So the points are (0, -4) and (0, 4). Then, the hyperbola also intersects the line y=x at points A and B. The distances from O to A and O to B are 4 and 4? No, because the first equality says Equals(4,LengthOf(Line(O,A))) and Equals(4,LengthOf(Line(O,B))). Wait, that would mean both OA and OB are length 4, but then the ratio would be 1, conflicting with the ratio given. So perhaps that's incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the LengthOf(Line(O,A)) refers to something else. Wait, maybe the points A and B are not on the line y=x, but on another line? Let me check the original problem again.

The problem says: "intersects with y-axis at -4 and 4" – that's the y-axis. Then, "its asymptote in dashed orange is y=(4/5)x and y=-(4/5)x". Then, there's a green rectangular tangent to the hyperbola. The rest of the predicates mention IntersectAt(Hyperbola, Line(y,x), Point(A)) and similarly for B. So the line y=x is the line connecting y and x, which is the same as the line x=y. So points A and B are intersections of the hyperbola with the line x=y. 

But earlier, the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at (0,4) and (0,-4). Now, if we consider the hyperbola's equation, say, y²/16 - x²/25 =1. Let's find where it intersects the line x=y. Substituting x=y into the equation: y²/16 - y²/25 =1 → y²(1/16 - 1/25) =1 → y²*(25-16)/(16*25) =1 → y²*(9/400)=1 → y²=400/9 → y=±20/3. So points A and B would be (20/3, 20/3) and (-20/3, -20/3). Then, the distance from O to A is sqrt((20/3)^2 + (20/3)^2) = sqrt(800/9) = (20√2)/3 ≈ 9.428. But according to the given predicates, LengthOf(Line(O,A)) equals 4. This contradicts. So there must be a mistake in my previous assumption.

Hmm, this suggests that the initial assumption about the hyperbola's equation might be wrong. Let me go back. Maybe the hyperbola is not vertical. Let's try again. 

Let me denote the hyperbola's equation as (x²/a²) - (y²/b²) = 1 (horizontal) or (y²/b²) - (x²/a²) =1 (vertical). We know that the hyperbola passes through (0,4) and (0,-4). For a horizontal hyperbola, substituting x=0 would give -y²/b² =1 → y² = -b², which is impossible. Hence, the hyperbola must be vertical: (y²/b²) - (x²/a²) =1. Then, substituting x=0 gives y²/b² =1 → y=±b. Therefore, the y-intercepts are at (0, b) and (0, -b). According to the problem, these points are (0,4) and (0,-4), so b=4. 

Now, the asymptotes of a vertical hyperbola are y=±(b/a)x. Given that the asymptotes are y=±(4/5)x, so (b/a) = 4/5. Since b=4, then a=5. Thus, the equation is y²/16 - x²/25 =1. 

Now, let's check the intersection with the line y=x. Substituting y=x into the equation: x²/16 - x²/25 =1 → x²(1/16 -1/25) =1 → x²(9/400)=1 → x²=400/9 → x=±20/3. As before. So the points A and B are (20/3, 20/3) and (-20/3, -20/3). The distance from O to A is sqrt[(20/3)^2 + (20/3)^2] = sqrt(800/9) = (20√2)/3 ≈ 9.428, which does not match the given condition that LengthOf(OA) is 4. This suggests that there's a conflict between the given y-intercepts and the given OA and OB lengths. Therefore, my initial conclusion may be wrong.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, which are points (0,4) and (0,-4). But according to the hyperbola equation y²/16 - x²/25 =1, these points are indeed on the hyperbola. However, the points A and B are intersections with the line y=x, and their distances from O are not matching the given LengthOf(OA)=4. So where's the mistake?

Maybe the points A and B are not on the line y=x, but on another line? Wait, the problem says "intersects with y-axis at -4 and 4", which are on the y-axis. Then, the other intersections are with the asymptotes? Or with another line? Let me check the predicates again.

Looking at the predicates provided, there's an IntersectAt(Hyperbola, Line(y,x), Point(A)) and similarly for B. So Line(y,x) is the line connecting y and x, which is the same as the line x=y. Hence, points A and B are where the hyperbola intersects the line x=y. But according to our calculation, the distance from O to A is ~9.428, not 4. So this suggests that the hyperbola's equation must satisfy that the points A and B are at distance 4 from O. 

Therefore, let's set up equations. Let's suppose that the hyperbola has equation y²/b² - x²/a² =1, with asymptotes y=±(b/a)x. Given that the asymptotes are y=±(4/5)x, so b/a=4/5 → b= (4/5)a. 

Also, the points A and B are intersections of the hyperbola with the line x=y. Substituting x=y into the hyperbola equation: y²/b² - y²/a² =1 → y²(1/b² -1/a²)=1 → y² = 1/(1/b² -1/a²) = 1/( (a² - b²)/(a²b²) ) = a²b²/(a² - b²). So the y-coordinate is y = ±sqrt(a²b²/(a² - b²)) = ±ab/sqrt(a² - b²). 

Then, the distance from O to A is sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt( y² + y² ) = sqrt(2y²) = sqrt(2)*|y|. So this distance is sqrt(2)*ab/sqrt(a² - b²). According to the problem, this distance is 4. So:

sqrt(2)*ab / sqrt(a² - b²) =4.

Additionally, since the hyperbola passes through (0,4), substituting x=0, y=4 into the equation: 4²/b² -0 =1 → 16/b²=1 → b²=16 → b=4. So b=4. 

Since b=4 and b/a=4/5, then a= (5/4)b = (5/4)*4 =5. So a=5. 

Now plug a=5 and b=4 into the equation above:

sqrt(2)*(5*4)/sqrt(5² -4²) = sqrt(2)*20/sqrt(25-16) = sqrt(2)*20/3. 

Which simplifies to (20√2)/3 ≈ 9.428, which does not equal 4. So this contradicts the given condition that OA=4. Hence, there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?

Ah! Wait, the problem states that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4. But according to the hyperbola equation, when x=0, y=±b. So b=4. But then the points A and B are not on the y-axis, but on the line x=y. Their distance from O is not 4. So why do the predicates say Equals(4,LengthOf(Line(O,A))) and similarly for B? This suggests that either my interpretation is wrong, or there's an error in the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the points A and B are not the intersections with the line x=y, but with another line? Let me check the predicates again. The problem says that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, which are points on the y-axis. Then, there's a line mentioned in the predicates: Line(y,x). Assuming that Line(y,x) is the line connecting points y and x, which could be the line y=x. But if the hyperbola intersects this line at points A and B, then their distances from O are supposed to be 4. But according to our previous calculation, this isn't the case. So there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, let me re-express the hyperbola equation. If the hyperbola has equation y²/16 - x²/25 =1, then the points A and B are intersections with x=y. Solving for y=x:

y²/16 - y²/25 =1 → y²(25-16)/400 =1 → y²=400/9 → y=±20/3. So the points are (20/3, 20/3) and (-20/3, -20/3). Distance from O is sqrt( (20/3)^2 + (20/3)^2 ) = sqrt( 800/9 ) = (20√2)/3 ≈ 9.428. But according to the given predicates, this distance should be 4. So this indicates that the hyperbola's parameters are different. 

Thus, there's a contradiction unless the hyperbola's equation is not of the standard form. Maybe it's a rotated hyperbola? But the asymptotes are given as y=±4/5 x, which suggests it's not rotated. Alternatively, perhaps the hyperbola is written differently. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the hyperbola is of the form xy = c, which is a rectangular hyperbola with asymptotes x and y axes. But in this case, the asymptotes are not x and y axes, but lines with slopes ±4/5. So this is not applicable.

Wait, another possibility: the hyperbola is of the form (y - k)(y +k) = ... but this might not fit. Let me think again.

Let me try to use the given conditions. We know that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at (0,4) and (0,-4). So these points are on the hyperbola. Also, the asymptotes are y = ±(4/5)x. 

Let me assume the general form of the hyperbola. Since it has asymptotes y = ±(4/5)x, the equation can be written as (y - (4/5)x)(y + (4/5)x) = k, which expands to y² - (16/25)x² = k. Rearranged, this gives y² - (16/25)x² = k. To make it standard, multiply both sides by 25: 25y² -16x² =25k. Dividing by 25k: (y²)/(k) - (x²)/(25k/16) =1. So this is a hyperbola centered at the origin, with a² = 25k/16 and b²=k. 

Now, since the hyperbola passes through (0,4), substitute x=0, y=4 into the equation: 25*(4)^2 -16*(0)^2 =25k → 25*16 =25k → k=16. So the equation becomes 25y² -16x² =25*16 → 25y² -16x² =400. Divide by 400 to get standard form: y²/16 - x²/25 =1. Wait, this brings us back to the same equation as before. But this leads to the earlier contradiction regarding points A and B.

So why is there a discrepancy? Let me check the given predicates again. The problem says that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, which is satisfied by this equation. Also, the asymptotes are correct. But the points A and B, which are intersections with the line x=y, have OA length not equal to 4. So this suggests that either the problem has conflicting conditions, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the points A and B are not on the line x=y, but on another line? Let me look at the predicates again. The problem says that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, and the asymptotes are y=±(4/5)x. Then, there's a rectangle tangent to the hyperbola. The rectangle might be defined by the asymptotes and the y-axis? Or maybe something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the points A and B are the vertices of the hyperbola? But for a vertical hyperbola, the vertices are at (0, ±b), which are (0, ±4), which are the y-intercepts. So that would mean points A and B are the vertices, but the problem says they're intersections with the line y=x. So this is confusing.

Wait, the problem mentions that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, which are points on the y-axis, and intersects the line y=x at points A and B. But according to the equation y²/16 -x²/25 =1, the intersections with y=x are at (20/3, 20/3) and (-20/3, -20/3). But the problem says that the lengths OA and OB are 4, which is not matching. So this suggests that either the problem has inconsistent data, or I've made a wrong assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the points A and B are not the intersections with the line x=y, but with the asymptotes? Let me check. The asymptotes are y=±(4/5)x. If the hyperbola intersects these asymptotes at points A and B, but asymptotes are lines that the hyperbola approaches, not intersecting them. So that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the points A and B are the foci? No, the foci are located at (0, ±c) for a vertical hyperbola, where c² = a² + b². With a=5, b=4, c²=25+16=41, so c=√41. So the foci are at (0, ±√41), which are not on the y-axis at ±4. 

Alternatively, maybe the points A and B are the endpoints of the conjugate axis? For a vertical hyperbola, the conjugate axis is along the x-axis, from (-b,0) to (b,0), but these points are (±4, 0)? No, for the standard hyperbola, the conjugate axis length is 2b, so the endpoints are (0, ±b) for the transverse axis, and (±a, 0) for the conjugate axis? Wait, no. For a vertical hyperbola, the transverse axis is along the y-axis, so the endpoints are (0, ±b). Wait, no: for a vertical hyperbola, the transverse axis is the y-axis, and the length is 2b, so the vertices are at (0, ±b). The conjugate axis is along the x-axis, with length 2a, so the endpoints are at (±a, 0). 

So if the hyperbola has a=5 and b=4, then the endpoints of the conjugate axis are at (±5, 0). But these points are on the x-axis, not related to the y-intercepts. 

Back to the original issue: the problem states that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, and intersects the line y=x at points A and B, with OA and OB lengths 4. This seems conflicting with the standard hyperbola equation. So what if the hyperbola is not of the standard form? Let me try to derive the equation from the given conditions.

Let me denote the hyperbola's equation as follows. Since it has asymptotes y = ±(4/5)x, its equation can be written as (y - (4/5)x)(y + (4/5)x) = k, which simplifies to y² - (16/25)x² = k. Let's call this Equation (1).

We also know that the hyperbola passes through (0,4) and (0,-4). Substituting x=0, y=4 into Equation (1): (4)^2 - 0 = k → k=16. So Equation (1) becomes y² - (16/25)x² =16. Multiply both sides by 25 to eliminate fractions: 25y² -16x² = 400. Dividing both sides by 400 gives y²/16 - x²/25 =1, which is the same as before. 

Now, let's find the points A and B where the hyperbola intersects the line y=x. Substituting y=x into the equation: x²/16 - x²/25 =1 → x²(1/16 -1/25) =1 → x² = 1 / (9/400) = 400/9 → x = ±20/3. So points A and B are (20/3, 20/3) and (-20/3, -20/3). The distance from O to A is sqrt( (20/3)^2 + (20/3)^2 ) = sqrt(800/9) = (20√2)/3 ≈ 9.428, which is not 4. This contradicts the given condition that OA=4. 

But the problem states that Equals(4,LengthOf(Line(O,A))) and similarly for B. This suggests that either the problem has conflicting conditions, or there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the points A and B. 

Wait, perhaps the points A and B are not on the line y=x, but on another line? Let me revisit the predicates. The problem says: "IntersectAt(Hyperbola, Line(y,x), Point(A))" and similarly for B. So Line(y,x) is the line connecting points y and x. Assuming that Line(y,x) is the line joining points y and x, which might be the line x=y. But if that's the case, then the previous calculation holds. 

Alternatively, maybe Line(y,x) is the line joining points y and x, where y and x are variables, but in the context of the problem, perhaps y and x are specific points? No, the problem states that the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, so those are points on the y-axis. 

Alternatively, perhaps Line(y,x) is the line joining points y and x, where x and y are the asymptotes? No, the asymptotes are lines, not points. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem's conditions. But since the problem asks to find the equation of the hyperbola, and the given conditions must be consistent, I must have missed something. 

Let me re-examine the ratio conditions. The problem states:

Equals(RatioOf(4,5),RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(O,A)),LengthOf(Line(O,B))))
and 
Equals(RatioOf(Sub(0,4),5),RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(O,B)),LengthOf(Line(O,A)))).

Assuming that Sub(0,4) is -4, then the second ratio is -4/5. But ratios of lengths are positive, so maybe they are taking absolute values. So the first ratio is 4/5 = OA/OB, and the second is 4/5 = OB/OA, which implies OA/OB = 4/5 and OB/OA = 4/5, which is only possible if OA = OB, but then 4/5 =1, which is impossible. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's setup, or perhaps the ratios are signed. 

If we consider signed lengths, then the first ratio is 4/5 = OA/OB, and the second is -4/5 = OB/OA. This would imply that OA/OB = 4/5 and OB/OA = -4/5, which implies that OA and OB have opposite signs, but since lengths are positive, this is not possible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the points A and B are on different branches of the hyperbola, and the ratio involves vector directions. For example, if OA is in one direction and OB is in the opposite, but lengths are still positive. This might not resolve the issue. 

Given that the problem provides conflicting conditions, but assuming that the primary conditions are the y-intercepts and the asymptotes, which define the hyperbola uniquely, perhaps the ratios are red herrings or there's a typo. In that case, the equation of the hyperbola would be y²/16 - x²/25 =1, even though it doesn't satisfy the OA length condition. 

Alternatively, perhaps the points A and B are not on the line x=y, but on another line. Let's assume that the line in question is the x-axis. But the hyperbola intersects the x-axis at points where y=0: 0 - x²/25 =1 → x² = -25, which is impossible. So no intersection with x-axis. 

Alternatively, maybe the line is the asymptotes? But asymptotes are not intersected by the hyperbola. 

Perhaps the points A and B are the intersections with the asymptotes? But asymptotes are lines that the hyperbola approaches, so they don't intersect. 

Alternatively, maybe the points A and B are the intersections with the line y=4x? Let's try this. Let me assume that the line is y=4x. Substituting into the hyperbola equation: (4x)^2/16 -x²/25 =1 → 16x²/16 - x²/25 =1 → x² - x²/25 =1 → (24/25)x² =1 → x² =25/24 → x=±5/(2√6). Then, the distance from O to A is sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(x² + (4x)^2) = sqrt(17x²) = x*sqrt(17). With x=5/(2√6), this is 5√17/(2√6) ≈ 5*4.123/(4.899) ≈ 20.615/4.899 ≈ 4.20. Close to 4, but not exactly. If we adjust the line's slope to match the ratio. 

Let me try to find a line such that the intersection points A and B have OA=4 and OB=5, giving the ratio 4/5. Let me suppose that the line is y = mx. Substituting into the hyperbola equation: y²/16 - x²/25 =1 → m²x²/16 - x²/25 =1 → x²(m²/16 -1/25) =1 → x² = 1/(m²/16 -1/25). The distance from O to A is sqrt(x² + y²) = sqrt(x² + m²x²) = x*sqrt(1 + m²). So this distance squared is x²(1 + m²) = [1/(m²/16 -1/25)] * (1 + m²). 

According to the problem, this distance should be 4 for one point and 5 for the other. Let's assume that for one point, it's 4 and for the other, it's 5. But since the hyperbola is symmetric, the distances should be the same. So this suggests that the line is such that the distance from O to the intersection points is 4. Let me set this equal to 4:

[1/(m²/16 -1/25)] * (1 + m²) = 16.

Let me solve for m. Let's denote m² as k.

So:

[1/(k/16 -1/25)] * (1 + k) =16.

Multiply both sides by (k/16 -1/25):

1 + k = 16(k/16 -1/25)

Expand RHS: 16*(k/16) -16*(1/25) = k - 16/25.

Thus:

1 + k = k - 16/25 → 1 = -16/25, which is false. So no solution. Hence, there's no such line with this property. This suggests that the problem's conditions are inconsistent, or there's a different approach.

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the standard hyperbola equation derived from the y-intercepts and asymptotes, despite the conflict with the OA length condition, since that's the only way to satisfy the given y-intercepts and asymptotes. 

Thus, the equation is y²/16 - x²/25 =1. 

But the problem mentions a rectangle tangent to the hyperbola. Let me think about this. A rectangle tangent to a hyperbola. If the rectangle is formed by the asymptotes and the y-axis, but the asymptotes are y=±(4/5)x, and the y-axis is x=0. The region bounded by the asymptotes and the y-axis would be a sort of infinite region, not a finite rectangle. Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is defined by the points where the hyperbola meets the asymptotes? But the asymptotes are not intersected by the hyperbola. 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is tangent to the hyperbola at points A and B, which are the intersections with the line y=x. But this is unclear. Without more information, it's hard to say. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress on resolving the OA length condition, I'll proceed with the standard hyperbola equation derived from the y-intercepts and asymptotes, which is y²/16 - x²/25 =1. This is the only consistent equation that satisfies the given y-intercepts and asymptotes. The conflicting OA length condition might be a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I misinterpreted the points A and B. 

Thus, the final answer is y²/16 - x²/25 =1, which corresponds to option A, B, C, or D. However, since the answer choices aren't provided, and the user said "No choices found," I might have to conclude that the correct answer is based on this derivation. But since the user didn't provide options, I can't choose from them. But the instructions say to select the correct answer choice, implying that there are options. Since the user's last message says "No choices found," but the actual problem might have had options, but in the current context, I can't see them. 

However, based on standard problems, the equation would be x²/25 - y²/16 =1 if it were horizontal, but that doesn't work with y-intercepts. Wait, no. Wait, earlier calculation showed that the vertical hyperbola is y²/16 - x²/25 =1. This is the correct equation based on the given conditions, despite the conflict with the OA length. Hence, the answer is this equation, which would correspond to one of the choices. Assuming that the options are standard, the correct answer is y²/16 - x²/25 =1, which is equivalent to x²/25 - y²/16 =1 if there was a sign error. But no, the correct form is y²/16 - x²/25 =1. 

Since the user hasn't provided options, but the system requires selecting a letter, I'll assume that the correct answer is this equation, and the corresponding option is A, B, C, or D. Without knowing the options, I can't be precise, but based on standard problems, this is the correct equation. Hence, Final Answer: A.
