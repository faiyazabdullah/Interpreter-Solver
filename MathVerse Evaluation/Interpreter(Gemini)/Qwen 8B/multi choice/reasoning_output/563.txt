MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to figure out if the discriminant of the quadratic function g is positive, zero, or negative. The given information includes points A(-1,-4), B(-5,-4), and C(-3,0), with the quadratic function g passing through these points, opening downward, and having its vertex at point C.

First, I remember that the discriminant of a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 is b² - 4ac. The sign of the discriminant tells us about the roots: positive means two distinct real roots, zero means one real root (a repeated root), and negative means no real roots. But how does this relate to the graph of the quadratic function?

Since the quadratic opens downward (given OpensDownward(g)), the parabola has a maximum point at its vertex. The vertex here is at (-3,0), so the highest point on the graph is ( -3, 0 ). Points A and B are both at y = -4, which are symmetric around the vertex because they have the same y-coordinate. That suggests that the axis of symmetry of the parabola is x = -3, which makes sense since the vertex is at x=-3.

Now, since the parabola passes through points A(-1,-4) and B(-5,-4), these points are equidistant from the axis of symmetry. Let me check the distance from each point to x=-3. For point A at x=-1, the distance is |-1 - (-3)| = |2| = 2 units. Similarly, for point B at x=-5, the distance is |-5 - (-3)| = |-2| = 2 units. So they're symmetric, which aligns with the properties of a parabola.

To find the equation of the quadratic function, knowing it's in vertex form would be helpful. The vertex form is f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h,k) is the vertex. Here, the vertex is (-3,0), so substituting h=-3 and k=0 gives f(x) = a(x + 3)^2. 

We can use one of the other points to find 'a'. Let's take point A(-1, -4). Plugging into the equation:

-4 = a(-1 + 3)^2  
-4 = a(2)^2  
-4 = 4a  
So, a = -4 / 4 = -1.

Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = -(x + 3)^2. Expanding this to standard form:  
f(x) = -x² -6x -9. Wait, expanding (x+3)^2 is x² +6x +9, multiplied by -1 gives -x² -6x -9. 

But wait, let me verify with another point. Take point B(-5, -4):

f(-5) = -(-5 + 3)^2 = -(-2)^2 = -4, which matches. And the vertex at (-3,0): plugging x=-3, we get -(0)^2 = 0. Correct.

So the quadratic function is f(x) = -x² -6x -9. Now, the discriminant of this quadratic is b² - 4ac. In standard form ax² + bx + c, here a = -1, b = -6, c = -9.

Calculating discriminant D = (-6)^2 -4*(-1)*(-9) = 36 - 4*1*9 = 36 - 36 = 0. 

Wait, but the discriminant being zero implies that the quadratic has exactly one real root (a repeated root). However, the graph of the quadratic is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (-3,0). Since the vertex is the highest point, the parabola touches the x-axis at the vertex? Wait, the vertex is at ( -3, 0 ), so the y-coordinate is zero. Therefore, the parabola intersects the x-axis at the vertex. But since the parabola opens downward, the vertex is the maximum point, so the graph touches the x-axis at the vertex, implying that there's exactly one real root (the vertex lies on the x-axis). Hence, the discriminant should be zero.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the discriminant. Let me recheck:

Given f(x) = -x² -6x -9. So coefficients are a=-1, b=-6, c=-9.

Discriminant D = b² -4ac = (-6)^2 -4*(-1)*(-9) = 36 - 4*(9) = 36 - 36 = 0. Yes, correct. So discriminant is zero.

But wait, the problem states that the quadratic goes through points A and B, which are both at y=-4. So the parabola crosses the horizontal line y=-4 at two points, but since the vertex is at ( -3, 0 ), which is higher than those points. So the parabola's minimum (wait, no—it opens downward, so it has a maximum at the vertex). Therefore, the parabola's maximum is at y=0, and it goes down to y=-4 at points A and B. So the graph is above y=-4 except at points A and B where it equals -4. Therefore, the quadratic equation f(x) = -4 would have two solutions (x=-1 and x=-5), which correspond to points A and B. Thus, the equation -x² -6x -9 = -4 simplifies to -x² -6x -5 = 0, or x² +6x +5 = 0. The discriminant here would be 36 - 20 = 16, which is positive. Wait, but that seems conflicting with earlier conclusion.

Hold on, perhaps I confused the discriminant of the original quadratic versus the equation set to a certain value. Let me clarify:

The discriminant of the quadratic function itself (the original quadratic) is zero. However, when considering the equation f(x) = -4, which corresponds to the horizontal line intersecting the parabola, the discriminant of that equation (which is a quadratic in x) would be positive, indicating two intersection points. But the discriminant of the original quadratic function (the equation f(x)=0) is zero, because the vertex is on the x-axis. 

So the question asks about the discriminant of g. Since the quadratic function g is f(x) = -x² -6x -9, the discriminant of this quadratic is indeed zero. Therefore, the answer should be B: Zero. 

But wait, another thought: sometimes people refer to the discriminant of the quadratic equation formed by setting the function equal to zero. In this case, since the vertex is on the x-axis, the quadratic equation f(x)=0 has exactly one real root (with multiplicity two), hence discriminant zero. Therefore, the answer is B.
