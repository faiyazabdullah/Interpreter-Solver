MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question says there's a point at 4 and a blue arrow goes to the left from that point. We need to write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to parse the given predicates. There's a Point(4), which means there's a point labeled 4 on the number line. Then there's a Blue arrow going to the left from that point. Wait, the predicate mentions Line($1,$2) and PointLiesOnLine. But the arrow being blue probably refers to a line segment starting at point 4 and extending to the left. Since it's an arrow, maybe it's a ray? Or just a line segment?

Wait, the problem mentions a blue arrow going to the left from point 4. In standard number line terms, if we have a point at 4, moving left would mean decreasing values. But how does this relate to the interval notation? Interval notation represents ranges of real numbers. But without more information about the length or other points, how do we determine the interval?

Wait, maybe the blue arrow indicates direction but not necessarily a specific length. However, since it's an arrow, perhaps it's implying that the line extends infinitely to the left from point 4. But in that case, the interval would start at negative infinity up to 4? Wait, but arrows usually indicate direction, so if it's pointing left from 4, the line starts at 4 and goes left indefinitely. But the number line itself is infinite in both directions unless specified otherwise. However, the problem states "the set of numbers represented on the number line." Wait, but the presence of the blue arrow might imply that the line is only extended to the left from 4, but the entire number line still includes all real numbers. Unless there's some constraint here.

Alternatively, maybe the blue arrow is part of a coordinate system where the number line has markings corresponding to integers or something. But the problem doesn't specify that. Wait, the initial point is at 4, and the blue arrow goes to the left. If the number line is standard, then the arrow could represent the direction, but without knowing the length of the arrow, we can't determine specific intervals. Unless the arrow is indicating that the line is only defined up to that point. Wait, maybe the arrow implies that the line stops at 4 and goes left, but that wouldn't make sense because arrows typically extend infinitely. Alternatively, perhaps the blue arrow is a vector starting at 4 and pointing left, but again, without magnitude, we can't tell.

Wait, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-read the problem. It says, "Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation." So the number line has certain points marked, and we need to find the interval covered by those points. But the given info is a single point at 4 and a blue arrow going to the left from that point. 

Hmm, if the blue arrow is part of the number line, perhaps it's indicating that the line starts at 4 and extends to the left, meaning that the numbers represented are all real numbers less than or equal to 4? Because the arrow points left, so the line continues infinitely to the left from 4. Therefore, the interval would be (-∞, 4]. But wait, the problem says "the set of numbers represented on the number line". If the number line is the entire real line, then the interval is all real numbers. But maybe the blue arrow restricts it? Or maybe the arrow is just indicating direction, not length. 

But without any specific endpoints, how can we define an interval? Maybe the presence of the arrow suggests that the line is only from the starting point 4 onwards to the left. But that's unclear. Wait, in typical math problems, if you have a point on a number line and an arrow pointing left, it often signifies that the line extends infinitely to the left from that point. Hence, the set of numbers would be all real numbers less than or equal to 4, making the interval (-∞, 4]. But the problem might be expecting a different interpretation.

Wait, another thought: maybe the blue arrow is a segment starting at 4 and going to the left, but its length isn't given. Without knowing the length, we can't determine the endpoint. So perhaps the problem assumes that the arrow is just indicating direction, not a finite segment. Therefore, the interval would be from negative infinity up to 4. Thus, the interval notation is (-∞, 4].

However, the problem statement says "the set of numbers represented on the number line". If there's only one point at 4 and an arrow going left, maybe the number line includes all numbers from negative infinity up to 4. But the problem might be looking for something else. Wait, but the answer choices aren't given, and the user mentioned "No choices found," so maybe the answer is (-∞, 4], and the correct choice would be that. But since there are no choices listed, the assistant has to provide the answer directly. But according to the instructions, the answer should be selected from options A-D, but since they're not provided, maybe the original problem had them and the user omitted them. 

Wait, the user wrote "ANSWER CHOICES: No choices found." So maybe the original problem didn't have answer choices, and the user wants the answer in interval notation. But the instruction says to select the correct answer choice, which is confusing. But the user also said "your task is to solve... then select the correct answer choice" but the answer choices are not present. This seems conflicting. However, the user might have intended that even though there are no choices, we have to output the answer in the required format. 

Assuming that the answer is (-∞, 4], which in interval notation is written as (-infty, 4]. But since the user requires selecting from A-D, but they are not provided, perhaps there was an error. However, the user's instructions say to "select the correct answer choice", but since there are none, perhaps the actual answer is supposed to be inferred. Given the problem setup, the interval is from negative infinity up to 4, including 4. So the answer would be (-∞, 4]. 

Since the user hasn't provided answer choices, but the system expects a selection from A-D, but since there are no choices, maybe the original problem had options, and the user forgot to include them. However, the user might have intended for us to proceed regardless. Assuming that the correct interval is (-∞, 4], and the answer is expected to be in that form. But since the user says "answer choices: no choices found," perhaps the answer is simply that interval. 

In the absence of answer choices, but following the instructions, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct interval is (-∞, 4], and since the user requires a letter choice, but there are none, maybe the original problem had options like A: (-∞, 4], B: [4, ∞), etc., and the correct answer is A. But since I don't know the actual options, I can't be sure. However, based on the problem description, the answer is likely (-∞, 4], so the correct choice would be whatever corresponds to that. 

Given the lack of answer choices, but needing to follow the instructions, I think the answer should be Final Answer: A assuming A is the correct interval. But without knowing the options, this is uncertain. However, given the problem's phrasing, I'll go with (-∞, 4] as the interval.
