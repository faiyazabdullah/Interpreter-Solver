CHOICES:
No choices found.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three points: A(-4, 0), B(0, 2), and C(4, 0). They all lie on a curve, and we need to find the domain and range of this function based on the given points. 

First, I should figure out what kind of curve passes through these points. Since all three points are on the x-axis except point B, which is at (0,2), maybe it's a parabola? Because a parabola opens upwards or downwards and has symmetry. Let me check if these points fit a quadratic equation.

A general quadratic equation is y = ax² + bx + c. Let's plug in the points to find a, b, c. Starting with point A(-4, 0):

0 = a*(-4)^2 + b*(-4) + c → 0 = 16a -4b + c.

Then point C(4, 0):

0 = a*(4)^2 + b*4 + c → 0 = 16a +4b + c.

And point B(0, 2):

2 = a*(0)^2 + b*0 + c → c = 2.

So substituting c=2 into the first two equations:

For point A: 16a -4b + 2 = 0 → 16a -4b = -2.

For point C: 16a +4b + 2 = 0 → 16a +4b = -2.

Now, adding these two equations together: 32a = -4 → a = -4/32 = -1/8.

Substituting a back into one of the equations, say 16a -4b = -2:

16*(-1/8) -4b = -2 → -2 -4b = -2 → -4b = 0 → b = 0.

So the equation is y = (-1/8)x² + 0x + 2 → y = -x²/8 + 2.

Wait, but let me verify with point B: plugging x=0 gives y=2, which matches. For x=-4 and x=4, y would be -16/8 +2 = -2 +2=0, which is correct. So yes, this seems like a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (0,2).

Now, the domain of a parabola is all real numbers unless restricted. But the problem mentions Domain=[-4,4] and Range=[0,2]. Wait, the given points have x-values from -4 to 4, so maybe the domain is limited to [-4,4]? But the original question says the curve goes through those points, but does the curve extend beyond them?

But looking back at the problem statement, the user says "Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation." However, the initial given Domain and Range are [-4,4] and [0,2], respectively. Wait, but the problem says "the points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points," implying they are endpoints. So maybe the domain is restricted to [-4,4], since those are the x-values where the curve is defined. 

But wait, the curve could be part of a larger parabola, but since the problem specifies that the domain is [-4,4], perhaps the curve is only defined between x=-4 and x=4. Therefore, the domain is [-4,4], and the range would be from the minimum y-value to the maximum. Since the parabola opens downward, the maximum y occurs at the vertex (0,2), and the minimum y occurs at the ends. At x=-4 and x=4, y=0. So the range would be [0,2]. That matches the given Range=[0,2].

Therefore, the answer should be Domain [-4,4] and Range [0,2], which corresponds to the options provided. But the answer choices aren't listed here; the user said "No choices found" but the original problem had answer choices. Wait, the original problem didn't list answer choices, but the assistant was supposed to choose among A-D. However, since there are no choices, maybe the correct answer is to state domain [-4,4] and range [0,2], but since the answer choices weren't provided, the user might have intended to have us select based on the given Domain and Range. Wait, the problem says "Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation." But the initial given Domain and Range are [-4,4] and [0,2], which are already specified. So the answer would be domain [-4,4] and range [0,2]. However, since the user mentioned answer choices but they are not present here, perhaps the correct answer is to state those intervals. But the instructions say to select from answer choices labeled A-D, but since there are none, maybe the user made a mistake. However, according to the problem setup, the answer choices were not provided, so the correct answer is domain [-4,4] and range [0,2]. But the user wants the answer in the form of Final Answer: A/B/C/D. Since there are no choices, perhaps there's an error. Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply confirming the given Domain and Range, which are [-4,4] and [0,2], so the answer would be A, B, C, or D depending on how the choices are set up. However, without seeing the actual answer choices, it's impossible to know. But assuming that the answer is the given Domain and Range, which are [-4,4] and [0,2], then the answer is likely the combination of those, but since the user hasn't provided options, perhaps the answer is just stating those intervals. However, the problem says "select the correct answer choice", but since there are none, maybe the correct answer is to use the given Domain and Range. In that case, the answer is domain [-4,4] and range [0,2], which would correspond to the answer choices if they were, for example, A: [-4,4] and [0,2], etc. Assuming that the answer choices are labeled A, B, C, D with one being the correct pair, then the answer would be whichever choice matches. But since the user hasn't provided the options, I'll proceed under the assumption that the answer is the given Domain and Range, hence selecting the corresponding choice. But since there are no choices, perhaps the correct answer is to write the intervals, but the system requires choosing A-D. This is confusing. Maybe the answer is A, B, C, or D based on some standard options. Given that, and the fact that the problem states the Domain is [-4,4] and Range [0,2], the answer would be the combination of these, so if the answer choices included that, it would be the correct one. Without knowing the options, I can't be certain, but based on the given info, the answer is domain [-4,4] and range [0,2].
