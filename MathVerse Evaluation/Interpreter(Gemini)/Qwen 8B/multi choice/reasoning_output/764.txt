MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle where the lengths of the sides are given as x-3 and x+3. The perimeter is 72, and we need to find the value of x. Let me start by recalling the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle. 

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated as 2 times the sum of its length and width. So if one side is x+3 and the adjacent side is x-3, then adding them together would give us (x+3) + (x-3). Wait, but since there are two of each side, the perimeter should be 2*(length + width). Let me write that down properly.

So, the perimeter P = 2*(length + width). Here, the length and width are x+3 and x-3. But wait, actually, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So there are two sides of length x+3 and two sides of length x-3. Therefore, the total perimeter would be 2*(x+3) + 2*(x-3). Alternatively, that can be simplified as 2x + 6 + 2x -6, which combines to 4x. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me check again. 

Wait, expanding it: 2*(x+3) + 2*(x-3) equals 2x +6 + 2x -6. Then combining like terms, the +6 and -6 cancel out, leaving 4x. So the perimeter is 4x. And according to the problem, the perimeter is 72. So setting up the equation 4x = 72. Solving for x gives x = 72 divided by 4, which is 18. Hmm, so x would be 18? Let me verify that because sometimes I might mix up the sides.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the given predicate that says SumOf(x+3, x+3, x-3, x-3) equals 72. That's essentially the same as the perimeter. Adding all four sides: (x+3) + (x+3) + (x-3) + (x-3). Let's compute that. Combining like terms: x + x + x + x + 3 -3 +3 -3. Which simplifies to 4x + 0, so 4x = 72. Again, leading to x=18. 

But looking at the answer choices, 18 is option C. However, let me make sure there isn't a mistake here. Let me plug x=18 back into the original expressions. The length would be x+3 = 21 and the width x-3 = 15. Then the perimeter would be 2*(21 + 15) = 2*36 = 72. Yep, that checks out. 

Wait, but why does the problem mention the rectangle with Rectangle(1)? Maybe that's just labeling, but the key info is the perimeter being 72. So my calculation seems correct. But let me check again. Another way: if the sides are x+3 and x-3, then perimeter is 2*(x+3 + x-3) = 2*(2x) = 4x. So 4x=72 â†’ x=18. Yes, that's consistent. So the answer should be C. 

Looking at the options, C is 18. So the correct answer is C.
