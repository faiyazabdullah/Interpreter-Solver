MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right triangle where the hypotenuse is 5 units long, and one of the other sides is 3√2. We need to find the length of the remaining side, which is labeled as x. 

First, I remember that in a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies. That theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The formula is a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse.

Given that the hypotenuse here is 5, so c = 5. One of the legs is 3√2, so let's call that a = 3√2. The other leg is x, which we need to find. Plugging these into the Pythagorean theorem, we get:

(3√2)² + x² = 5²

Calculating (3√2) squared: 3 squared is 9, and (√2) squared is 2, so 9*2 = 18. Then 5 squared is 25. So substituting those numbers:

18 + x² = 25

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives x² = 25 - 18 = 7. Therefore, x is the square root of 7. 

Looking at the answer choices, option A is √7. So that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check my steps. The hypotenuse is indeed the longest side, and since 5 is longer than 3√2 (which is approximately 4.24), that makes sense. Applying the Pythagorean theorem correctly, and solving for x gives √7. Yep, that seems right. No mistakes there.
