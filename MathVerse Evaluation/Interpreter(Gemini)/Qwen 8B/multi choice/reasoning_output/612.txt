MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is about determining whether the graphed function is even or odd, given that it's a quadratic function opening upwards and passes through the origin. 

First, I need to recall what even and odd functions mean. An even function satisfies f(-x) = f(x), which means it's symmetric about the y-axis. An odd function satisfies f(-x) = -f(x), meaning it's symmetric about the origin. So, if the graph has symmetry about the y-axis, it's even; if it's symmetric about the origin, it's odd.

Now, the given function is a quadratic opening upwards. Quadratic functions are parabolas. The standard form is f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Since it opens upwards, the coefficient 'a' is positive. Also, it passes through the origin, so when x=0, f(0)=0. Plugging in, we get 0 = a*0 + b*0 + c → c=0. So the equation simplifies to f(x) = ax² + bx.

But wait, the problem mentions it's a quadratic function. However, if there's a linear term (bx), then the function isn't even unless b=0. Because if b≠0, then f(-x) = a(-x)^2 + b(-x) = ax² - bx, which is not equal to f(x) or -f(x). So for the function to be even, the linear term must be zero. Similarly, if there's no linear term (b=0), then f(x)=ax², which is even because substituting -x gives the same value. But if there's a linear term, then it's neither even nor odd.

However, the problem states that the curve is a quadratic function passing through the origin. Wait, but does being a quadratic automatically imply that it's even? No, because quadratics can have linear terms. But maybe there's more info here.

Wait, the given predicates mention some points. Let me check again. There's PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x)) and PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(y)). Also, Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y)), which suggests that the axes x and y are perpendicular. Then Shape(Parabola), Point(Origin), Equals(Origin, (0,0)), and PointLiesOnShape(Origin, Parabola).

So the parabola passes through the origin. Now, if the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, then it would be even. But if it's shifted, like if there's a linear term, then it wouldn't be. But how do we know if the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis?

In standard form, a parabola that's symmetric about the y-axis has the equation y = ax². If there's a linear term, like y = ax² + bx + c, then its axis of symmetry is at x = -b/(2a). For example, if there's a linear term, the vertex isn't on the y-axis. But the problem says it's a quadratic function opening upwards and passes through the origin. 

But since the origin is on the parabola, plugging in x=0 gives y=0. So c=0, making the equation y = ax² + bx. Now, if the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, then the axis of symmetry must be the y-axis, which requires that the linear term is zero (since the axis of symmetry is x = -b/(2a)). Therefore, if the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, then b=0. Otherwise, it's not symmetric about the y-axis.

But the problem doesn't specify whether the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis. However, the given predicates include that the lines x and y are perpendicular. Maybe this implies something about the orientation of the parabola. Wait, the parabola could be aligned with the coordinate axes. If the parabola is oriented vertically (standard case), then it's symmetric about the vertical line through its vertex. If it's horizontal, then it's symmetric about a horizontal line. But the question refers to it as a quadratic function, which typically implies a vertical parabola (y = ax² + ...). 

But without knowing the presence of the linear term, how can we determine if it's even or odd? Wait, the problem says the curve is a quadratic function opening upwards. If it's a quadratic function, then it's a parabola. But if it's a standard quadratic function, then it's symmetric about the vertical line through its vertex. Unless it's a horizontal parabola, but those aren't functions. Wait, functions can't be horizontal parabolas because they'd fail the vertical line test. So the parabola must open upward or downward, hence symmetric about a vertical line.

So, the function is y = ax² + bx + c. Since it passes through the origin, c=0. So y = ax² + bx. Now, for this to be an even function, we need f(-x) = f(x). Let's compute f(-x): a(-x)^2 + b(-x) = ax² - bx. For this to equal f(x) = ax² + bx, we need -bx = bx → bx = 0 for all x. That implies b=0. So if b=0, then it's even. If b≠0, then it's neither even nor odd.

But the problem doesn't state anything about the linear term. However, the given predicates include that the origin lies on the parabola, which we already used. Are there other clues? The predicates also mention that the lines x and y are perpendicular. How does that relate?

Wait, perhaps the fact that the parabola passes through the origin and is a quadratic function opening upwards. If the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, then it's even. But if it's not symmetric, then it's not. However, the problem doesn't give us enough info about the linear term. Wait, but the question is phrased as "the curve shown in the figure". Since the user hasn't provided the figure, but the given predicates may imply something.

Looking back at the predicates, there's a point (0,0) lying on both the x and y lines. Wait, the lines x and y are the coordinate axes. So the origin is on both lines. Also, the lines x and y are perpendicular. So the coordinate system is standard. The parabola passes through the origin. Now, if the parabola is a quadratic function, then it's a vertical parabola. If it's symmetric about the y-axis, then it's even. But how do we know if it's symmetric about the y-axis?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that the parabola is a quadratic function, which usually implies it's symmetric about the vertical line through its vertex. But unless specified otherwise, the vertex could be anywhere. However, since the parabola passes through the origin, but that doesn't fix the vertex's position. 

But wait, the question asks if the graphed function has an even or odd power. Wait, maybe the question is referring to whether the exponents in the polynomial are even or odd. For instance, if the function is y = x^2, which is even. If it's y = x^3, that's odd. But the function is quadratic, so the highest degree term is 2, which is even. However, the presence of a linear term complicates things. 

Wait, the question says "the graphed function have an even or odd power?" Maybe it's a translation issue. Perhaps it's asking whether the function is even or odd, considering the powers involved. For example, if the function is even, all exponents are even, or if it's odd, all exponents are odd. But a quadratic function has the highest exponent 2, which is even. However, if there's a linear term (exponent 1), then it's mixed. But the function being quadratic means that the degree is 2. However, if the function is y = x^2, it's even. If it's y = x^2 + x, then it's neither even nor odd. 

But the problem states that the curve is a quadratic function. So the degree is 2. But the presence of lower-degree terms depends on the specific function. However, the question seems to ask whether the function is even or odd. Given that the function is quadratic, but without more info, can we deduce it's even? Or is there another way?

Wait, the problem includes that the origin lies on the parabola. Suppose the function is y = ax². Then it's even. If it's y = ax² + bx, then it's not even unless b=0. However, the problem states that the parabola passes through the origin. But if the function had a linear term, then the origin is still on the parabola because when x=0, y=0. So both cases are possible. But how can we determine which one applies?

Wait, the original question is phrased as "Does the graphed function have an even or odd power?" Maybe the wording is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking whether the function is even or odd, given that it's a quadratic function passing through the origin. But without more info, how?

Wait, maybe the fact that the lines x and y are perpendicular (as per the predicate) implies that the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis. Because if the parabola were symmetric about the y-axis, then it would be an even function. But why would the perpendicularity of x and y lines affect that?

Alternatively, perhaps the parabola is defined such that it's symmetric about the y-axis, hence even. But that's assuming that the parabola is in the standard orientation. Since the problem didn't specify any other conditions, but the answer options are even or odd, and the function is quadratic (so degree 2, which is even), but the parity (even/odd) of the function depends on the coefficients.

Wait, but the question is likely asking whether the function is even or odd. Since it's a quadratic function, which is a second-degree polynomial. If the function is even, it must satisfy f(-x) = f(x). For that, all the exponents in the polynomial must be even. In a quadratic function, the highest degree is 2 (even). However, if there is a linear term (degree 1, odd), then the function isn't even. But the presence of a linear term would make it not even. So unless the linear term is zero, the function isn't even.

But how can we tell if the linear term is zero? The given information is that the parabola passes through the origin. This only tells us that when x=0, y=0, which leads to c=0. It doesn't provide information about the linear term. So unless there's more constraints, we can't conclude.

Wait, but the problem says it's a quadratic function opening upwards. The direction of opening (upwards) is determined by the coefficient 'a'. If the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis, then it's even. But if it's not symmetric, then it's not. However, the question is about the function's parity. Without knowing the linear term, we can't definitively say. But maybe there's an implicit assumption that the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis since it's a standard quadratic function.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the fact that the function is a quadratic (second-degree) polynomial, which inherently has even powers. But that's not accurate. A quadratic function can have terms with x^2 and x. For example, y = x^2 + x is quadratic but not even. So the presence of the linear term changes the parity.

Hmm. This is confusing. But given the options are Even or Odd, and the function is quadratic, perhaps the intended answer is Even. Because if the function is symmetric about the y-axis, then it's even. And since it's a quadratic function, maybe the standard form assumed is y = ax^2, which is even. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that. 

Alternatively, maybe the fact that the parabola passes through the origin and is symmetric about the y-axis (which is implied by the coordinate system's perpendicular x and y lines) makes it even. But why would that be inferred? 

I think the key here is that the problem is testing understanding of even and odd functions. Since the function is a quadratic (degree 2), which is even if it's symmetric about the y-axis. But without explicit info about the linear term, maybe the default assumption is that there's no linear term, making it even. Hence, the answer would be Even (Option B). 

Therefore, the answer should be B.
