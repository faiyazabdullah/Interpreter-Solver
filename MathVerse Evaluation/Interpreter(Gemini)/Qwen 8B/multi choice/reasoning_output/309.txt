MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an equilateral triangle RST. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, and all angles are 60 degrees. The problem gives us expressions for the lengths of the sides in terms of x. 

First, let me note down the given side lengths:
- RS = x + 9
- ST = 2x
- RT = 3x - 9

Since it's an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal. That means RS should equal ST, ST equals RT, and RT equals RS. So I need to set up equations where each pair of these expressions are equal and solve for x.

Starting with RS = ST:
x + 9 = 2x  
Subtract x from both sides: 9 = x  
So x would be 9 here. But wait, I also need to check if this value satisfies the other equalities, like ST = RT and RT = RS.

Let me plug x=9 into ST and RT:
ST = 2*9 = 18
RT = 3*9 -9 = 27 -9 = 18

So ST and RT are both 18. Then RS when x=9 is 9+9=18. All sides are 18, so that works. Wait, but let me check if there are other possibilities. For example, maybe another equation could give a different x? Let me check RS = RT as well.

RS = RT:
x + 9 = 3x -9  
Subtract x from both sides: 9 = 2x -9  
Add 9 to both sides: 18 = 2x  
So x=9 again. Same result. So regardless of which equality I use, x comes out to be 9. Therefore, the answer should be C:9. 

But wait, looking at the answer choices, C is 9. However, sometimes problems can have tricks. Let me double-check my math. 

For x=9:
RS = 9+9=18
ST=2*9=18
RT=3*9-9=18. Yep, all equal. So that works. 

Wait, but maybe there's something wrong with the setup? The problem says the triangle is equilateral, so all sides must be equal. So setting each pair equal gives the same x. Hence, x=9. So the answer is C. But let me check the options again. The choices are A:3, B:6, C:9, D:12. So C is correct. 

I think that's solid. No contradictions here. All equations lead to x=9. So the answer must be C.
