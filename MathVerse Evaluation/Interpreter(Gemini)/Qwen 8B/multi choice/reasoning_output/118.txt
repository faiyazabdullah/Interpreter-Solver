MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, the question says that the expanded lateral surface of a cone is a semicircle with a radius of 10.0. We need to find the radius of the bottom of the cone. The answer choices are A:3, B:4, C:5, D:6.

First, I need to recall what happens when you unfold a cone's lateral surface. When you do that, you get a sector of a circle, right? But here it's mentioned that it's a semicircle. Wait, so the lateral surface becomes a semicircle. That means the sector formed is actually a semicircle. 

So, the original cone's slant height would correspond to the radius of the semicircle. Because when you unroll the cone, the radius of the sector becomes the slant height (l) of the cone. Let me confirm that. Yes, the slant height l of the cone is equal to the radius of the sector when unfolded. Here, the radius of the semicircle is given as 10.0, so that means the slant height l = 10.0 units.

Now, the circumference of the base of the cone relates to the length of the arc of the sector. Since the sector is a semicircle, its arc length is half the circumference of a full circle with radius 10. So, arc length = π * r = π * 10. But wait, the formula for the circumference of a full circle is 2πr, so half of that is πr. Therefore, the arc length of the semicircle is π*10 = 10π.

But this arc length corresponds to the circumference of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base of the cone is 2πR, where R is the radius of the base we need to find. So, setting these equal: 2πR = 10π. Dividing both sides by π gives 2R = 10, so R = 5. That would make the radius of the base 5. Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, but let me check again if I made any mistake here. The problem states that the expanded figure is a semicircle with radius 10. So the sector's radius is 10, which is the slant height l=10. Then, the arc length of the sector is π*10, which equals the circumference of the base of the cone. Hence, 2πR = π*10 → R=5. So yes, answer should be C.

Alternatively, maybe there's something else I'm missing. Let me think about the relationship between the sector and the cone. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base. Also, the radius of the sector is the slant height. So, yes, that seems right. 

Another way: the circumference of the base is 2πR, and the arc length of the sector is θr, where θ is the central angle in radians. For a semicircle, the central angle is π radians. So arc length is π*r. Which is π*10. So equate that to 2πR. Then R=5. Yep, same result. So answer is C.
