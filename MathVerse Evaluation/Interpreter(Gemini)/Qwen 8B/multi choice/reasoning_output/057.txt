MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two lines, AB and CD, which are parallel. Angle B is given as 20 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle C. Hmm, okay. Let me recall some geometry concepts here.

First, since AB is parallel to CD, maybe there are some properties related to parallel lines and transversals. But wait, where are points B and C located? The problem mentions angle B and angle C, so I think they're probably part of a transversal or something. Maybe there's a triangle involved?

Wait, if AB and CD are parallel, perhaps there's a transversal cutting them, creating corresponding angles or alternate interior angles. But without seeing the figure, I need to make assumptions. Let me think. Typically, when dealing with parallel lines and angles, if there's a triangle formed, maybe with a transversal intersecting both lines.

Alternatively, could it be that points A, B, C, D form a trapezoid? Since AB and CD are parallel, making them the two bases of a trapezoid. Then angles at B and C would be adjacent angles on the same side. Wait, but in a trapezoid, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. Wait, but angle B is given as 20 degrees. If AB and CD are the two bases, then angle B and angle C would be on different sides. Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize.

Let me sketch mentally: imagine AB and CD are two horizontal parallel lines. Suppose there's a line connecting B to C, forming a transversal. Then angle B is at point B, between AB and BC. Similarly, angle C is at point C, between CD and CB. Wait, but if AB || CD, then the angles at B and C could be consecutive interior angles, which are supplementary. Wait, but if angle B is 20 degrees, then angle C would be 180 - 20 = 160 degrees? That doesn't match any of the options. Hmm, that suggests my assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe angle B and angle C are corresponding angles? If there's another transversal, like AD or BC. Wait, maybe the figure is a parallelogram? No, because in a parallelogram opposite angles are equal. But if AB is parallel to CD, but unless AD is also parallel to BC, which isn't stated. 

Wait, perhaps the problem involves a triangle. For example, if there's a triangle ABC with AB parallel to CD, but that seems unclear. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involving points B and C connected by a transversal. Let me think again about the standard cases.

Another possibility: AB and CD are cut by a transversal BC, forming corresponding angles. Wait, if AB is parallel to CD, and BC is a transversal, then angle B and angle C could be corresponding angles. But if angle B is 20 degrees, then angle C would also be 20 degrees. But that would mean answer B. However, sometimes depending on the position, these could be alternate interior angles, which would also be equal. But if angle B and angle C are on the same side, they'd be supplementary. 

But why does the answer options include 20°, 40°, etc.? Let me check again. The problem says AB is parallel to CD, angle B is 20°, and asks for angle C. Without more info, it's ambiguous. But maybe there's a diagram that's missing here. Wait, the user mentioned "as shown in the figure," but since I don't see the figure, I need to infer based on common problems.

Wait, another thought: maybe ABCD is a trapezoid with AB || CD, and BC as one of the legs. In that case, angles at B and C are adjacent angles on the leg BC. If AB || CD, then angles B and C are consecutive interior angles, which sum up to 180 degrees. Therefore, if angle B is 20°, angle C would be 160°, but that's not among the options. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe ABCD is a triangle with AB parallel to CD? Wait, how? If AB and CD are parts of a triangle? Not sure. Or perhaps ABCD is a quadrilateral with AB || CD and BC intersecting AD? Maybe it's a trapezium.

Wait, another scenario: suppose AB and CD are two parallel lines, and there's a triangle ABC where AB is parallel to CD. Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe angle B is inside a triangle, and angle C is another angle. 

Alternatively, consider triangle BCD with AB parallel to CD. If AB is parallel to CD, then maybe triangle ABC and triangle DBC have some relation? Not sure.

Wait, maybe there's a transversal crossing AB and CD, creating angles. For instance, if there's a line intersecting AB at B and CD at C, then angle at B and angle at C would be either corresponding, alternate interior, or consecutive interior angles. If AB || CD, then corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

So if angle B is 20°, and angle C is a corresponding angle, then angle C would also be 20°, making answer B. But if angle C is a consecutive interior angle, then it would be 160°, which isn't an option. But answer B is 20°, which is possible. However, sometimes problems assume certain configurations. 

But wait, the problem states "angle B" and "angle C". Depending on the diagram, angle B could be an angle formed by a transversal. For example, if AB and CD are parallel, and BC is a transversal, then angle B is at point B between AB and BC, and angle C is at point C between CD and BC. In that case, those two angles would be consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. So angle B + angle C = 180°, so angle C would be 160°, which is not an option. Hence, contradiction.

Alternatively, if angle B and angle C are alternate interior angles, then they would be equal. So angle C would be 20°, which is option B. But how would that configuration look? If AB || CD and BC is a transversal, then angle B and angle C would be on opposite sides of the transversal. Wait, no. Alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal. So if AB || CD, and BC is a transversal, then angle B (at B) and angle C (at C) would be on the same side of the transversal BC, making them consecutive interior angles. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal. So if AB and CD are parallel, and BC is the transversal, then angle at B (between AB and BC) and angle at C (between CD and BC) would actually be consecutive interior angles, not alternate. Because they are on the same side of the transversal. So they should add up to 180°, leading to angle C being 160°, which isn't an option. So that suggests that maybe the diagram has a different setup.

Perhaps angle B and angle C are not on the same transversal. Maybe there's another line involved. For example, if there's a triangle ABC with AB parallel to CD, where D is another point. Wait, this is getting confusing without the figure.

Wait, another possibility: the figure is a triangle with AB parallel to CD, implying that CD is part of another line. For example, maybe ABC is a triangle, and CD is a line segment drawn such that CD is parallel to AB. Then angle B is an angle of the triangle, and angle C is another angle. But how?

Alternatively, think of a triangle where AB is one side, and CD is a line parallel to AB, creating similar triangles. For instance, if CD is parallel to AB, then maybe triangle CBD is similar to triangle CAB, leading to certain angle relations. But angle B in triangle ABC would correspond to angle C in triangle CBD? Not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem refers to a triangle ABC with AB parallel to DC. For example, if DC is a line segment starting at D and going to C, with DC parallel to AB. Then, angle B is at vertex B, and angle C is at vertex C. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging.

Alternatively, perhaps angle B and angle C are vertical angles or something else. But vertical angles are formed by two intersecting lines, so that's unlikely here.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. If AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC, then angles at B and D would be equal, and angles at A and C would be equal. But the problem only states AB || CD, not necessarily AD || BC. So unless it's a parallelogram, which isn't specified.

Hmm. This is tricky without the diagram. But since the answer options are A:40°, B:20°, C:60°, D:70°, and angle B is 20°, let's think of scenarios where angle C would be 20°, 40°, etc.

If AB and CD are parallel, and there's a transversal forming a triangle, maybe with angles adding up. For example, if angle B is 20°, and angle C is an exterior angle. Wait, in a triangle, the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. But how?

Alternatively, if there's a transversal creating a triangle with angles. Suppose AB and CD are parallel, and there's a triangle with vertices at B, C, and another point. For instance, if BC is a transversal, and there's a triangle BCD. But angle B is 20°, angle C is ?

Wait, let's try assuming that angle B and angle C are same-side interior angles. Then they are supplementary. So angle C = 180 - 20 = 160°, which isn't an option. So that's out.

If they are alternate interior angles, then they are equal, so angle C is 20°, which is option B. That fits. But why would they be alternate interior angles?

For example, if there's a transversal intersecting AB at B and CD at C, then angle B and angle C would be alternate interior angles if the transversal crosses AB and CD at different points. Wait, no. If AB and CD are parallel, and a transversal intersects AB at B and CD at C, then angle B and angle C would be on the same side of the transversal, making them consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. So that's not alternate.

Alternate interior angles would require the transversal to cross AB at B and CD at some other point, say E, such that BE is the transversal. Then angle at B and angle at E would be alternate. But the problem refers to angle C, so maybe the transversal passes through C?

This is getting too vague. Another approach: since the answer options include 20°, maybe the answer is B. But why?

Wait, perhaps the problem is about a triangle where AB is parallel to CD, and angle B is 20°, and angle C is an alternate interior angle. Like, if there's a triangle ABC with AB parallel to CD, and CD is extended to meet at some point. Maybe forming similar triangles?

Alternatively, think of AB and CD as two parallel lines, and BC as a transversal. Then, if angle at B is 20°, then the corresponding angle at C would be 20°, making angle C equal to 20°, answer B. But how?

If AB || CD and BC is a transversal, then corresponding angles are equal. So angle B (on AB) and angle C (on CD) would be corresponding angles. Wait, but angle B is at point B on AB, and angle C is at point C on CD. If BC is the transversal, then yes, those would be corresponding angles. Thus, angle C equals angle B, so 20°, answer B.

That makes sense. So the answer would be B. But I'm not entirely sure due to the ambiguity, but given the options, and assuming that angle B and angle C are corresponding angles, the answer is B.
