MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding how many solutions the equation x³ - x² - x = -2 has, using the graph of y = x³ - x² - x. The answer choices are A to D. 

First, I need to recall that solving the equation x³ - x² - x = -2 is equivalent to finding the points where the graph of y = x³ - x² - x intersects the horizontal line y = -2. The number of solutions corresponds to the number of intersection points between these two graphs.

Given that the original function is y = x³ - x² - x, I know it's a cubic polynomial. Cubic functions generally have an 'S' shape, but depending on the coefficients, they can have different behaviors. Since the leading term is x³, as x approaches positive infinity, y tends to positive infinity, and as x approaches negative infinity, y tends to negative infinity. This means the graph should cross the x-axis at least once, but here we're looking for intersections with y = -2.

Wait, the problem mentions that the graph passes through certain points: (-1, -1), (0, 0), (1, -1), (2, 2). Let me check those points. For x = -1: (-1)^3 - (-1)^2 - (-1) = -1 - 1 + 1 = -1, so yes, that point is on the graph. At x=0: 0 - 0 - 0 = 0, correct. At x=1: 1 - 1 -1 = -1, right. And x=2: 8 - 4 - 2 = 2, correct. So the graph is plotted through these points.

Now, to find how many times y = -2 intersects this cubic curve. Let me think about the behavior of the cubic. Let me consider the function f(x) = x³ - x² - x. We want to solve f(x) = -2, which is equivalent to x³ - x² - x + 2 = 0. Wait, actually, moving -2 to the left side gives x³ - x² - x + 2 = 0? Wait, original equation is f(x) = -2 → x³ - x² - x = -2 → x³ - x² - x + 2 = 0. So we need to find the roots of this cubic equation.

But instead of algebraically solving, maybe analyzing the graph would be easier. Let me sketch mentally the graph of y = x³ - x² - x. From the given points, at x=-1, y=-1; at x=0, y=0; at x=1, y=-1; at x=2, y=2. Also, since it's a cubic, there should be one local maximum and one local minimum. To find critical points, take derivative f'(x) = 3x² - 2x -1. Setting to zero: 3x² -2x -1 =0. Solving quadratic equation: discriminant D = 4 + 12 = 16. Roots are [2 ± 4]/6 → (2+4)/6=1, (2-4)/6=-1/3. So critical points at x=1 and x=-1/3.

So the function has a local maximum at x=-1/3 and a local minimum at x=1. Let me compute the corresponding y-values. For x=-1/3: f(-1/3) = (-1/3)^3 - (-1/3)^2 - (-1/3) = -1/27 - 1/9 + 1/3. Converting to common denominator 27: -1/27 - 3/27 + 9/27 = ( -1 -3 +9 ) /27 = 5/27 ≈ 0.185. So the local max is around 0.185. Then at x=1, f(1)= -1 as before. So the local min is at y=-1.

So the graph increases to x=-1/3, reaching a peak near y≈0.185, then decreases until x=1, reaching y=-1, then increases again towards infinity. Now, we need to see where y=-2 crosses this graph. 

Since the local maximum is at ~0.185 and the local minimum at y=-1. So the lowest point of the graph is at y=-1 (at x=1). But the equation we want is y=-2, which is lower than the minimum value of the function. Therefore, the horizontal line y=-2 does not intersect the graph because the minimum value of the function is -1, which is higher than -2. Hence, there are no real solutions. 

Wait, but wait! That seems conflicting. Because if the function's minimum is -1, then y=-2 is below that. So the equation x³ -x² -x = -2 would have no real solutions. But let me confirm. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the local minima?

Let me recalculate the local minimum at x=1. Plugging x=1 into f(x): 1^3 -1^2 -1 = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct. What about other points? For example, when x approaches negative infinity, the function tends to negative infinity. Wait, earlier thought was that as x→-infty, y→-infty. But according to the critical points, there is a local maximum at x=-1/3 and a local minimum at x=1. So the graph comes from negative infinity, rises to the local max at x=-1/3 (~0.185), then falls to the local min at x=1 (y=-1), then rises again to infinity. Therefore, the function tends to negative infinity as x→-infty, reaches a peak at ~0.185, then drops to y=-1 at x=1, then increases again. Therefore, the range of the function includes all values from negative infinity up to the local max and down to the local min. Wait, no. Wait, the function has a local maximum at x=-1/3, then decreases to the local minimum at x=1. So the overall range is from negative infinity up to the local maximum, then down to the local minimum, then back to infinity. Wait, but how does that work? Let me think again. The cubic function will go from negative infinity upwards, reach a local maximum at x=-1/3, then decrease to a local minimum at x=1, then increase to positive infinity. Therefore, the minimum value of the function is the local minimum at x=1, which is y=-1, and the function can take all values less than or equal to the local maximum (which is ~0.185) and greater than or equal to the local minimum. Wait, no. Actually, since it's a cubic, after the local minimum at x=1, it goes to positive infinity. So the function's range is (-∞, ∞), except that between the local max and min, it's decreasing. Wait, no. Wait, the function tends to negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity, reaches a local maximum at x=-1/3, then decreases to a local minimum at x=1, then increases to positive infinity. Therefore, the function takes all values from negative infinity up to the local maximum (since after the local maximum, it decreases to the local minimum, then increases again). Wait, but if it goes from negative infinity up to the local maximum, then down to the local minimum, then up to infinity. So the minimum value of the entire function is the local minimum at x=1, which is y=-1. Therefore, the function can attain all values from negative infinity up to the local maximum (which is ~0.185), and then again from the local minimum (y=-1) to infinity. Wait, no—this is confusing. Let me clarify. 

Actually, the function's range is all real numbers because it's a cubic. However, between the local maximum and local minimum, the function decreases from the local maximum to the local minimum. So the minimum value achieved is the local minimum at x=1 (y=-1), and the maximum is the local maximum at x=-1/3 (y≈0.185). However, for values less than the local minimum, the function can't achieve them. Wait, no. Because as x approaches negative infinity, the function tends to negative infinity. So even though there's a local maximum, the function still goes to negative infinity on the far left. So the range is all real numbers. Wait, but if the function has a local maximum and a local minimum, but since it's a cubic, it must cross every horizontal line. Wait, but that contradicts my previous thought. Let me check with specific examples. For instance, the equation x³ - x² -x = -2. Let's plug in some values. When x is very large negative, say x = -10: (-10)^3 - (-10)^2 - (-10) = -1000 - 100 +10 = -1090, which is much less than -2. So the function attains values less than -2. Therefore, there must be solutions where the function equals -2. Wait, but earlier calculation said that the local minimum is at y=-1. How come?

Ah! There's a contradiction here. My earlier conclusion that the local minimum is at y=-1 must be wrong. Let me recheck the computation of the local minimum. Critical points are at x=1 and x=-1/3. Let me calculate f(1) again: 1^3 - 1^2 -1 = 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct. What about the other critical point, x=-1/3: f(-1/3) = (-1/3)^3 - (-1/3)^2 - (-1/3) = (-1/27) - (1/9) + (1/3) = convert to 27 denominators: -1/27 - 3/27 + 9/27 = ( -1 -3 +9 ) /27 = 5/27 ≈ 0.185. So that's correct. So the local maximum is at x=-1/3 with y≈0.185 and local minimum at x=1 with y=-1. But then why does the function tend to negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity? Because the leading term is x³, which dominates. So even though there is a local maximum at x=-1/3, the function still goes to negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity. Thus, the function must cross y=-2 somewhere on the far left. So there must be at least one solution. Wait, but how?

Let me try plugging in x=-2: f(-2) = (-8) - 4 - (-2) = -8 -4 +2 = -10. Which is less than -2. So at x=-2, y=-10. At x=-1, y=-1. So between x=-2 and x=-1, the function goes from -10 to -1. Therefore, since it's continuous, by Intermediate Value Theorem, there must be a root between x=-2 and x=-1 where y=-2. Then, since the function decreases from the local maximum at x=-1/3 (approx 0.185) to the local minimum at x=1 (y=-1), then increases afterward. So between x=-infty and x=-1/3, the function is increasing from -infty up to the local maximum. Then decreases from x=-1/3 to x=1, reaching y=-1. Then increases again to infinity. Therefore, the equation y=-2 would cross the graph once on the interval from x=-infty to x=-1/3 (because it goes from -infty up to 0.185), crossing y=-2 once. Then, between x=-1/3 and x=1, the function decreases from 0.185 to -1. So during this interval, it goes from 0.185 to -1, passing through y=-2? Let me check. At x=-1/3, y≈0.185, and at x=1, y=-1. So between x=-1/3 and x=1, the function decreases from 0.185 to -1. Therefore, it must cross y=-2 once in this interval? Wait, but if it starts at 0.185 and ends at -1, then it would pass through y=-2 once. But wait, 0.185 is above -2, and it ends at -1, which is also above -2. So if it starts at 0.185, decreases to -1, then it never reaches -2. So in that interval, there's no crossing. Then, after x=1, the function increases from -1 to infinity. So between x=1 and infinity, starting at y=-1, going up. So it will cross y=-2 once? Wait, no. Because at x=1, y=-1, which is higher than -2. As x increases beyond 1, the function increases, so it doesn't reach -2 again. So total crossings would be once on the left side (from -infty to -1/3) and none elsewhere? Or wait, perhaps another crossing?

Wait, but earlier when I checked x=-2, y=-10 < -2, and at x=-1, y=-1 > -2. So between x=-2 and x=-1, the function goes from -10 to -1, crossing y=-2 once. Then, between x=-infty to x=-1/3, the function increases from -infty to 0.185, so crosses y=-2 once. Then between x=-1/3 and x=1, it decreases from 0.185 to -1, so it doesn't cross y=-2 again. After x=1, it increases from -1 to infinity, so doesn't cross y=-2 again. So total of one solution? But that conflicts with the initial thought that the local minimum is at y=-1. Wait, but the function at x=1 is y=-1. So if the function reaches y=-1 at x=1, then it's increasing afterwards. So the minimal value of the function is y=-1. Therefore, the equation y=-2 is below the minimum value of the function. But earlier, we saw that at x=-2, y=-10 < -2. So that suggests there is a solution on the left side. So why did I think earlier that the local minimum is at y=-1? Because the function has a local minimum at x=1, but the global minimum is at x approaching negative infinity. Wait, no. The function tends to negative infinity as x approaches negative infinity, so there is no global minimum. It just has a local minimum at x=1. Therefore, the function can take any value from negative infinity up to the local maximum. So y=-2 is within that range, hence there is at least one solution. 

Therefore, the equation x³ -x² -x = -2 has one real solution. But wait, earlier calculation suggested that between x=-2 and x=-1, the function goes from -10 to -1, crossing y=-2 once. But could there be more than one crossing on the left side?

To check, let's analyze the behavior of the function for x < -1/3. The function is increasing on (-infty, -1/3). Since it goes from -infty to 0.185. So it's strictly increasing there. Therefore, the equation y=-2 would have exactly one solution in this interval. Then, between x=-1/3 and x=1, the function is decreasing from 0.185 to -1, so it doesn't cross y=-2 again. Then, after x=1, it increases from -1 to infinity, so it doesn't cross y=-2 again. Hence, only one solution. Therefore, the answer should be B: One solution.

But wait, the original question says the graph goes through (-1,-1), (0,0), (1,-1), (2,2). So at x=1, y=-1. But the equation we are solving is y=-2. So the graph of y=-2 would intersect the cubic once on the left side (for x < -1/3). So the answer is one solution. Therefore, answer B.
