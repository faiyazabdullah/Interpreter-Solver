QUESTION:
Elena knows that Lea has a garden with an area of 100 square meters. She does not know the specific width, $w$, and length, $l$ of the garden. The graph below represents the widths that correspond to possible lengths of Lea's garden, which decreases when $w$ increases and goes through (5,20), (10,10), (20,5). As the possible width of Lea's garden increases, what does its possible length approach?

CHOICES:
A:$\infty$
B:$\hline 0$
C:$\hline 10$
D:$\hline 120$

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Elena knows that Lea's garden has an area of 100 square meters. The question is about how the possible length approaches as the width increases, given some points on a graph. The points mentioned are (5,20), (10,10), and (20,5). 

First, I need to visualize what's going on here. The problem mentions a graph where widths correspond to possible lengths. The points given are (width, length) pairs. Wait, but the way it's phrased says "the graph below represents the widths that correspond to possible lengths", so maybe it's a graph with width on one axis and length on the other? But since the points are listed as (5,20), (10,10), (20,5), that suggests that when the width is 5, the length is 20; when width is 10, length is 10; and when width is 20, length is 5. 

But wait, the area is fixed at 100. For a rectangle, area is length multiplied by width. So if the area is constant, then length times width equals 100. That would mean that length = 100 / width. Let me check that with the given points. 

For example, if width is 5, then length should be 100 / 5 = 20. Which matches the first point (5,20). Similarly, width 10 gives 100/10=10, which matches (10,10). And width 20 gives 100/20=5, matching (20,5). So the relationship between width and length is inversely proportional because area is fixed. Therefore, as the width increases, the length must decrease proportionally. 

But the question asks, as the possible width of the garden increases, what does its possible length approach? So we're looking at the behavior as width approaches infinity. Since length is 100 divided by width, as width increases without bound, length approaches zero. So the limit as width approaches infinity of 100/w is zero. 

Wait, but the answer options include B as approaching zero. However, let me make sure there isn't something else here. The problem mentions that the graph shows these points, but perhaps there's more to it? Like, could there be constraints that make the relationship not purely inverse? But according to the given data, the product of width and length is always 100. So regardless of other factors, as long as the area remains 100, the length is inversely proportional to the width. Therefore, as width increases, length approaches zero. 

Looking at the answer choices, B is "0". So the answer should be B. 

But wait, let me check again. The problem states that the graph represents widths corresponding to possible lengths, and the points given are (5,20), (10,10), (20,5). These points lie on the hyperbola width Ã— length = 100. So plotting those points, they form a hyperbola. As width increases, the length decreases towards zero. So the possible length approaches zero. Hence, the answer is B.
