MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two quadrilaterals, ABCD and AEFG, which are similar. The question is asking for the measure of angle ADC. Let me start by recalling what similar figures mean. Similarity implies that corresponding angles are equal and corresponding sides are in proportion.

First, I need to note down all the given information. The points mentioned are A, B, C, D, E, F, G. There are lines connecting them as per the given predicates. Quadrilateral ABCD is similar to quadrilateral AEFGB? Wait, wait, the second quadrilateral is AEGF? Let me check again. The given quadrilaterals are ABCD and AEF-G. Wait, the second one is A, E, F, G. So it's A-E-F-G-A. 

So, similarity between ABCD ~ AEF-G. Also, there are several length measures and angle measures given. For example, angle AGF is 108 degrees, GF is 14 units, AD is 12, DG is 4.5, EF is 8, AB is 26. Also, some angle equalities: angle ADC equals angle AFE, angle ABC equals angle AFE (wait, original says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,E,F))), so angle ABC equals angle AEF. And angle BCD equals angle EFG. Also, angle DAG equals angle DAB. Wait, the last equality is Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(G,A,E)),MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B))). So angle GAE equals angle DAB. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should draw a rough sketch mentally. Let me visualize the quadrilaterals. ABCD is a quadrilateral with vertices A, B, C, D connected as Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A). Similarly, AEF-G is another quadrilateral with points A, E, F, G connected as Line(A,E), Line(E,F), Line(F,G), Line(G,A).

Since they're similar, the order of the letters matters. So, ABCD ~ AEF-G, meaning that vertex A corresponds to A, B corresponds to E, C corresponds to F, D corresponds to G? Or perhaps different correspondence? Wait, similarity requires that corresponding angles are equal and sides are proportional. But how do we know the correspondence?

But since the similarity is given as Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) ~ Quadrilateral(A,E,F,G), that suggests that the order of the vertices corresponds. So, A corresponds to A, B corresponds to E, C corresponds to F, D corresponds to G. Therefore, the similarity ratio would be between AB/ AE, BC/EF, CD/FH... Wait, but need to check.

Alternatively, since the similarity could be in different orders, but given that both quadrilaterals share point A, it's likely that the correspondence is A→A, B→E, C→F, D→G. Because otherwise, if the correspondence was different, like A→A, B→E, C→G, D→F, but that might complicate things. Let me assume that the correspondence is A→A, B→E, C→F, D→G. That seems plausible because the quadrilateral AEF-G has vertices A, E, F, G. So if ABCD ~ AEF-G, then each vertex corresponds accordingly.

Therefore, the similarity transformation maps ABCD to AEF-G, preserving order. Thus, AB corresponds to AE, BC to EF, CD to FG, DA to GA. Wait, but DA corresponds to GA? Let me think. In quadrilateral ABCD, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. In quadrilateral AEF-G, the sides are AE, EF, FG, GA. So if ABCD ~ AEF-G, then AB corresponds to AE, BC to EF, CD to FG, DA to GA. So the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal.

Given that, we can write the ratios of the sides. Let me list the given lengths:

AB = 26. What's the corresponding side in the other quadrilateral? Since AB corresponds to AE. Wait, but AE is part of the second quadrilateral. Wait, the first quadrilateral's side AB corresponds to the second's AE. So AB / AE = BC / EF = CD / FG = DA / GA. 

But we have some lengths given. Let's see:

In the second quadrilateral, FG is given as 14. FG corresponds to CD in the first quadrilateral. Wait, CD in ABCD corresponds to FG in AEF-G. So CD / FG = ratio. Also, DA corresponds to GA. DA is given as 12, and GA is the side from G to A in the second quadrilateral. But GA is part of the second quadrilateral. Wait, GA is the same as AG. So GA is a side of the second quadrilateral. However, we don't have its length directly. But maybe we can find it via other info.

Also, DG is given as 4.5. DG is a segment from D to G. Wait, D is part of the first quadrilateral, and G is part of the second. How does that fit in? Maybe DG is a diagonal or something else? Wait, DG connects D to G. But in the given lines, there is Line(D,A) and Line(G,A). So D is connected to A, and G is connected to A. So DG is a line connecting D and G. Not sure yet. Let me think about the given angles. Angle at A in the second quadrilateral, angle AGF is 108 degrees. So angle at G in the second quadrilateral? Wait, angle AGF is at point G, between A, G, F. So angle at G between AG and GF. Which would correspond to angle at D in the first quadrilateral? Wait, since the similarity mapping would map D to G. So angle at D in ABCD corresponds to angle at G in AEF-G. So angle ADC in ABCD corresponds to angle AGF in AEF-G. Wait, angle ADC is at D, between A-D-C. So in ABCD, angle ADC is the angle at D. In the similar quadrilateral AEF-G, the corresponding angle would be at G. Which is angle AGF. Wait, angle AGF is at G, between A-G-F. So yes, that would correspond to angle ADC. Therefore, angle ADC is equal to angle AGF, which is given as 108 degrees? But wait, that contradicts the answer options. Wait, answer options are A:14, B:72, C:108, D:120. Option C is 108. But wait, the question asks for angle ADC. But according to this, angle ADC equals angle AGF, which is 108 degrees. But that would make answer C. However, the problem states that angle AGF is 108 degrees. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, the given says MeasureOf(Angle(A,G,F)) is 108. So angle at G between A, G, F. So that's angle AGF. If ABCD ~ AEF-G, then angle ADC (at D in ABCD) corresponds to angle AGF (at G in AEF-G). Therefore, angle ADC = angle AGF = 108 degrees. Then answer would be C. But why is that? But wait, maybe my assumption about the correspondence is wrong. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence isn't A→A, B→E, C→F, D→G. Suppose instead that the similarity is such that A corresponds to A, B corresponds to E, C corresponds to F, D corresponds to G. Then angle at D in ABCD (which is angle ADC) would correspond to angle at G in AEF-G. Which is angle AGF. So angle ADC equals angle AGF. Hence, 108 degrees. So answer C. But why is that not matching with other given data? Let me check the other given data.

Wait, but there are other given lengths. For instance, DA is 12. DA corresponds to GA. So DA/GA = ratio. Also, DG is 4.5. DG connects D to G. But how does that relate? Maybe DG is part of a triangle or something else. Alternatively, maybe there are more relations here.

Wait, also given that LengthOf(Line(G,F)) is 14. Which is FG. FG corresponds to CD. So CD / FG = ratio. So CD / 14 = ratio. Also, DA is 12, which corresponds to GA. So GA = DA * ratio. But GA is the length from G to A. But how do we find GA? Well, maybe through other relations.

Additionally, EF is given as 8. EF corresponds to BC. So BC / EF = ratio. Also, AB is 26, which corresponds to AE. So AB / AE = ratio. So these ratios should all be equal.

Let me denote the similarity ratio as k. So k = AB / AE = BC / EF = CD / FG = DA / GA.

We have AB = 26. Let's say AE is x. Then 26/x = k.

Similarly, EF is 8. BC / 8 = k => BC = 8k.

CD / 14 = k => CD = 14k.

DA = 12, so 12 / GA = k => GA = 12/k.

Now, if we can find k, we can find other lengths. But how?

Also, we have DG = 4.5. DG connects D to G. Let me think about where D and G are located. D is part of ABCD, and G is part of AEF-G. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral with D connected to A. G is connected to A. So DG connects D to G. Is there a way to express DG in terms of other segments?

Alternatively, maybe considering triangles. For example, consider triangle DGA. We know DA = 12, GA = 12/k, and DG = 4.5. So triangle DGA has sides DA=12, GA=12/k, DG=4.5. But unless we know more about the angles, we can't use the law of cosines or sines here. Unless there's some relationship.

Alternatively, maybe DG is part of another triangle or relates to the similarity ratio. Alternatively, maybe considering coordinates. Assign coordinates to the points and compute.

But perhaps there's another approach. Let me recall the given angle equalities. The problem states that angle ADC equals angle AFE. Wait, original says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,E))). So angle ADC equals angle AFE. Also, angle ABC equals angle AEF, and angle BCD equals angle EFG. Also, angle DAG equals angle DAB.

Wait, angle DAG is at point A between D, A, G. And angle DAB is at point A between D, A, B. So these angles are equal. So angle DAB equals angle DAG. Which suggests that points B and G lie on the same line relative to A? Or that AB and AG form the same angle? Wait, angle DAG is between DA and GA, while angle DAB is between DA and BA. So if those are equal, then BA and GA make the same angle with DA. So that would imply that BA and GA are symmetric with respect to DA? Or that B and G are arranged such that the direction from A is mirrored?

This might suggest that triangle DAG and something else are involved. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, since ABCD ~ AEF-G, and angle ADC corresponds to angle AGF (as discussed earlier), which is given as 108 degrees. So angle ADC is 108 degrees. But that would make answer C. However, the problem gives answer choices including 108, but maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, but let me re-examine the angle correspondence. If ABCD ~ AEF-G, then the correspondence of angles is as follows:

Angle A in ABCD corresponds to angle A in AEF-G.

Angle B in ABCD corresponds to angle E in AEF-G.

Angle C in ABCD corresponds to angle F in AEF-G.

Angle D in ABCD corresponds to angle G in AEF-G.

Thus, angle ADC is the angle at D in ABCD. In the similar quadrilateral, the corresponding angle is at G. So angle at G in AEF-G, which is angle AGF. Wait, angle AGF is at G, formed by points A, G, F. So that is indeed the angle at G in quadrilateral AEF-G. So angle AGF corresponds to angle ADC. Therefore, angle ADC equals angle AGF, which is given as 108 degrees. So answer C. But why is this possible? The answer options include 108 as choice C. But why then give other information like DG=4.5, EF=8, etc.? Maybe there's an error in my reasoning.

Wait, but the problem states that the quadrilaterals are similar, but maybe the correspondence isn't as straightforward. For example, maybe the similarity is not in the order ABCD ~ AEF-G but in a different order. For instance, maybe ABCD ~ AFGE or something else. But the given predicate is Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D) ~ Quadrilateral(A,E,F,G), so the order is preserved. So the correspondence is A→A, B→E, C→F, D→G. So angle ADC (at D) corresponds to angle AGF (at G), hence equal. So angle ADC is 108 degrees. So answer C.

But why is there so much other information given? Like DG=4.5, EF=8, AB=26, etc. Perhaps there's a contradiction here? Let me check with the ratios.

Suppose that the ratio k is AB/AE = BC/EF = CD/FG = DA/GA.

We have AB=26, EF=8, CD= ?, FG=14, DA=12, GA= ?

From FG=14, CD= k*14.

From DA=12, GA=12/k.

Also, BC = k*8.

But without knowing more, how can we find k? Maybe using DG=4.5.

DG connects D to G. Assuming that in the diagram, D is a vertex of ABCD and G is a vertex of AEF-G. So DG is a segment connecting these two points. How can we relate DG to other parts?

Perhaps considering triangle DGA. In triangle DGA, we have sides DA=12, GA=12/k, and DG=4.5. If we can find an angle in this triangle, we can use the Law of Cosines or Sines.

But what angle do we know? Let's think. From the given angle equalities, angle DAG equals angle DAB. Angle DAB is the angle at A between D and B. Since AB is a side of ABCD, and DA is another side. So angle DAB is part of quadrilateral ABCD. But angle DAG is the angle at A between D and G. Since G is part of the other quadrilateral. Given that angle DAG equals angle DAB, which suggests that the angle between DA and AB is equal to the angle between DA and AG. This implies that AB and AG are symmetric with respect to DA. So if we imagine point A with DA going off in some direction, and AB and AG forming equal angles with DA. So AB and AG are on opposite sides of DA, making equal angles. Hence, triangle DAG and something else?

Alternatively, if AB and AG are symmetric with respect to DA, then the ratio of AB to AG could be determined via some relation. But without knowing angles, it's hard to tell.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me try assigning coordinates.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Let me define coordinates for other points based on this.

Assume point A is at (0,0). Let me assign coordinates to other points.

For quadrilateral ABCD: points A(0,0), B somewhere, C somewhere, D somewhere.

For quadrilateral AEF-G: points A(0,0), E somewhere, F somewhere, G somewhere.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, focus on triangle DGA. In triangle DGA, sides DA=12, DG=4.5, GA=12/k. Also, angle DAG equals angle DAB.

But angle DAB is part of quadrilateral ABCD. Let me think. In quadrilateral ABCD, angle at A is DAB. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the sum of internal angles is 360 degrees. But without knowing other angles, not helpful.

Alternatively, since ABCD is similar to AEF-G, and we have angle relations. For example, angle at A in ABCD (DAB) corresponds to angle at A in AEF-G. Wait, angle at A in AEF-G is angle EAG. Because AEF-G is a quadrilateral with vertices A, E, F, G. The angles at A would be between E and G. So angle EAG. But earlier, we had angle DAG equals angle DAB. So angle DAG equals angle DAB. So angle between DA and AG equals angle between DA and AB. Hence, AB and AG are symmetric with respect to DA. So AB and AG make equal angles with DA. So if I imagine DA as a line from A, then AB and AG are on either side of DA, creating equal angles. Therefore, AB and AG are reflections over DA.

If that's the case, then the length AB and AG could be related through reflection. But how?

Alternatively, if AB and AG are symmetric with respect to DA, then the ratio of AB to AG depends on the distance from A along DA. But without more info, it's still unclear.

Alternatively, since we have triangle DGA with sides DA=12, DG=4.5, GA=12/k. Let's suppose that we can use the Law of Cosines here. But we need an angle. However, we know that angle DAG equals angle DAB. Let me denote angle DAG as θ. Then angle DAB is also θ. In triangle DGA, using the Law of Cosines:

DG² = DA² + GA² - 2 * DA * GA * cos(theta)

Plugging in DG=4.5, DA=12, GA=12/k:

(4.5)^2 = 12^2 + (12/k)^2 - 2*(12)*(12/k)*cos(theta)

But theta is angle DAG, which is equal to angle DAB. Now, angle DAB is part of quadrilateral ABCD. Also, since ABCD is similar to AEF-G, angle DAB corresponds to angle EAG. Wait, angle at A in ABCD (DAB) corresponds to angle at A in AEF-G (EAG). So angle DAB = angle EAG. But angle EAG is part of quadrilateral AEF-G. 

But I don't know the measure of angle EAG. However, we might be able to find it via other means. 

Alternatively, since we have other given angles. For example, angle AGF is 108 degrees. Let me consider triangle AGF. In triangle AGF, we know FG=14, AG=12/k, and angle at G is 108 degrees. Wait, angle AGF is 108 degrees. So in triangle AGF, angle at G is 108 degrees. Using the Law of Cosines here:

AF² = AG² + FG² - 2 * AG * FG * cos(angle AGF)

But AF is a side in the second quadrilateral, which corresponds to BC in the first quadrilateral. So BC = k * EF. Wait, EF is 8, so BC = 8k. But AF is another side in the second quadrilateral. Wait, AF is part of the second quadrilateral AEF-G. Let me clarify.

Quadrilateral AEF-G has sides AE, EF, FG, GA. So AF is a diagonal, not a side. So AF is not directly a side. So maybe not helpful. 

Alternatively, since ABCD ~ AEF-G, the ratio of sides is consistent. So if I can find k, I can relate the sides. But I need more equations.

Let me think again about the ratio k. We have:

AB / AE = BC / EF = CD / FG = DA / GA = k.

We know AB = 26, EF = 8, FG = 14, DA = 12.

So:

AB / AE = k → 26 / AE = k → AE = 26 / k.

BC / 8 = k → BC = 8k.

CD / 14 = k → CD = 14k.

DA / GA = k → 12 / GA = k → GA = 12 / k.

Now, what else do we know? We have DG = 4.5. DG connects D to G. How can we relate DG to these variables?

Maybe consider triangle DGA again. As before, DG = 4.5, DA = 12, GA = 12/k. Let's try applying the Law of Cosines in triangle DGA with angle DAG = theta (equal to angle DAB).

So:

DG² = DA² + GA² - 2 * DA * GA * cos(theta)

=> 4.5² = 12² + (12/k)² - 2 * 12 * (12/k) * cos(theta)

But we need to find theta. Theta is angle DAG, which is equal to angle DAB. In quadrilateral ABCD, angle DAB is part of the angles. Also, since ABCD is similar to AEF-G, angle DAB corresponds to angle EAG. So angle DAB = angle EAG.

But angle EAG is part of quadrilateral AEF-G. Let me consider triangle EAG. In this triangle, we have AE = 26/k, AG = 12/k, and angle at A is angle EAG = theta. So using the Law of Cosines here:

EG² = AE² + AG² - 2 * AE * AG * cos(theta)

But EG is a diagonal in quadrilateral AEF-G, which may not be directly useful. However, maybe combining with other information.

Alternatively, since ABCD is similar to AEF-G, the ratio k is constant across all sides. So if we can find another equation involving k, we can solve for it.

Another idea: Since angle AGF is 108 degrees, and ABCD ~ AEF-G, angle at G in AEF-G (which is angle AGF) corresponds to angle at D in ABCD (angle ADC). So angle ADC = angle AGF = 108 degrees. Hence, regardless of other information, angle ADC is 108 degrees. This would make answer C. But why is there other information given? It might be a red herring, or perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the correspondence of angles.

Wait, but if angle ADC corresponds to angle AGF, then angle ADC = 108 degrees. But the problem gives other angles, like angle AFE equals angle ADC. Wait, the problem states Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,C)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,F,E))). So angle ADC equals angle AFE. Angle AFE is at point F, between A, F, E. Which is part of quadrilateral AEF-G. Since ABCD ~ AEF-G, angle AFE corresponds to angle BCD. Because angle at C in ABCD (angle BCD) corresponds to angle at F in AEF-G (angle AFE). So angle BCD = angle AFE = angle ADC. So angle BCD = angle ADC. But in a quadrilateral, consecutive angles may have certain relations. However, without knowing more about the type of quadrilateral (like being a parallelogram, trapezoid, etc.), it's hard to say. 

But if angle ADC is 108 degrees, then angle BCD is also 108 degrees. But in a general quadrilateral, angles can vary. However, the fact that the quadrilaterals are similar suggests that all corresponding angles are equal. So angle ADC = angle AGF = 108 degrees. Hence, answer C.

However, I need to verify this conclusion against the given data. For example, if angle ADC is 108 degrees, then what about other angles? Let me check with the similarity ratio.

Assuming that angle ADC is 108 degrees, then angle AGF is also 108 degrees. Let me check if this holds with the other given information. For example, in quadrilateral AEF-G, angle AGF is 108 degrees. Also, since ABCD ~ AEF-G, all corresponding angles are equal. So angle at D (ADC) = angle at G (AGF). Hence, this seems consistent.

Therefore, despite having other given lengths, the measure of angle ADC is directly given by the corresponding angle in the similar quadrilateral, which is 108 degrees. Hence, the answer should be C.
