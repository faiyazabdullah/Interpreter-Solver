====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question says that function g in red is a translated version of f(x) = x² in blue. We need to find the equation for g(x). 

Looking at the given predicates, there are several points and lines mentioned. Let me parse them out. There's Point(A) and Point(B), and Line(A,B). Then there are other lines x and y, with perpendicularity between them. Also, Shape(f) and Shape(g), with Blue(f) and Red(g). The IsVertexOf predicates indicate that points A and B are vertices of shapes f and g respectively. Additionally, PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x)) and similarly for other points and lines. Also, IsTranslationOf(g,f) suggests that shape g is a translation of shape f.

Wait, but the main thing here is translating the function f(x) = x². Translating a function involves shifting it horizontally or vertically. Since translations don't change the shape, just the position, so if f(x) = x² is translated to get g(x), we need to find the horizontal and vertical shifts.

But how do the given predicates relate to this? Let me think. The points A and B are vertices of shapes f and g. Maybe these points correspond to specific points on the original and translated parabolas. For example, if f(x) is a parabola, its vertex is at (0,0) because the standard form is y = x². But wait, the problem mentions Equals(0,0) and Equals(-2,1). Are those coordinates?

Wait, the Equals predicates might be indicating coordinates. So maybe point A has coordinates (0,0) and point B has (-2,1)? Because Equals(0,0) could mean that a certain coordinate is (0,0), and Equals(-2,1) another. But how does that tie into the functions?

Also, since A lies on lines x and y, and B also lies on lines x and y. Wait, but if lines x and y are perpendicular, then they might be axes. Suppose line x is horizontal and line y is vertical, intersecting at some point. Points A and B lie on both lines x and y? No, that would mean they're the intersection point. But there are two points, A and B. Hmm, maybe lines x and y are the axes. For instance, line x is the x-axis (horizontal) and line y is the y-axis (vertical). Then point A lies on both lines x and y, which would be the origin. But point B also lies on both lines x and y, which would imply that B is also the origin. That doesn't make sense unless A and B are the same point, but they are different points. Therefore, maybe lines x and y aren't the axes. Alternatively, perhaps lines x and y are two perpendicular lines that cross each other, and points A and B lie on both lines. Wait, but a single point can't lie on two different lines unless they intersect at that point. So if lines x and y are perpendicular and intersect at point A, then point A is their intersection. Similarly, point B lies on both lines x and y, implying that B is also the intersection point. Therefore, A and B must be the same point. But that contradicts the fact that they are distinct points. Therefore, my initial assumption about lines x and y must be incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps lines x and y are not both containing both points A and B. Let me re-examine the predicates. The PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x)), PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(y)), PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(x)), PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(y)). So both points A and B lie on lines x and y. Which means lines x and y contain both A and B. Therefore, lines x and y are the same line, but that can't be since they are perpendicular. Unless lines x and y are the same line, but they are supposed to be perpendicular. Contradiction again. Therefore, there's something wrong with my interpretation.

Wait, maybe the Lines x and y are not the same. If both A and B lie on line x and line y, then lines x and y must be such that both points lie on them. So, if lines x and y are two different lines that both pass through points A and B. Which would mean that lines x and y are the same line, but they are supposed to be perpendicular. Therefore, this seems impossible unless points A and B are the same. This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the predicates.

Let me check again. The predicates say:

- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x))
- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(y))
- PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(x))
- PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(y))

So, both points A and B lie on both lines x and y. That implies that lines x and y are the same line, since they contain both A and B. However, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y)). So if lines x and y are the same line, they can't be perpendicular. Therefore, contradiction. Hence, my previous assumptions must be wrong.

Alternative possibility: The lines x and y are different. But how can both points A and B lie on both lines? Unless lines x and y are two different lines that both pass through A and B. But that requires that lines x and y are the same line, which conflicts with being perpendicular. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. Perhaps the mistake is in assuming that both points lie on both lines x and y. Wait, no—the predicates state that for each point, they lie on both lines x and y. Wait, no—actually, the first two lines are PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(y)). Then similarly for B. So, A lies on both lines x and y; B lies on both lines x and y. Thus, lines x and y are two different lines that both contain points A and B. Therefore, lines x and y must be the same line, which conflicts with being perpendicular. Hence, there's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the lines x and y are not both containing both points? Or perhaps the lines x and y are not both containing both points?

Wait, no. The way the predicates are written: Each of the four PointLiesOnLine statements applies to either A or B. So for example, PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(y)) — so A lies on both lines x and y. Similarly, B lies on both lines x and y. Therefore, lines x and y are the same line, but they are supposed to be perpendicular. Therefore, contradiction. This suggests that either the problem has conflicting information, or my understanding of the predicates is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines x and y are not both passing through both points. Wait, no. The predicates explicitly say that both A and B lie on both lines x and y. Therefore, unless the lines x and y are the same line, which they can't be since they are perpendicular. So this seems like a paradox. How can two different lines be perpendicular and both contain two distinct points A and B?

Ah! Wait, unless lines x and y are not both containing both A and B. Wait, no. The predicates are:

- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x)): A is on line x
- PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(y)): A is on line y
- PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(x)): B is on line x
- PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(y)): B is on line y

Therefore, line x contains both A and B, and line y contains both A and B. Therefore, lines x and y are the same line. But they are supposed to be perpendicular. So this is impossible. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the lines x and y are not both containing both points. Wait, but the predicates state that each point lies on both lines. So, for example, line x contains both A and B, and line y contains both A and B. Therefore, lines x and y are the same line. But they are supposed to be perpendicular. This is impossible. Hence, there's a contradiction here, suggesting that perhaps the problem isn't well-posed, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the lines x and y are not the same. Wait, but how can both lines x and y contain both A and B if they are different lines? They can't unless A and B are the same point. But since A and B are distinct points (they are vertices of different shapes), this can't be. Hence, there's a contradiction. Therefore, maybe the problem is designed such that lines x and y are the same line, even though they are supposed to be perpendicular. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem uses non-Euclidean geometry? Unlikely, since the question refers to standard functions and translations.

This suggests that there's a mistake in how I'm interpreting the predicates. Let me try another approach. Let's forget about the lines x and y for a moment and focus on the rest. The problem states that g is a translation of f. Since f is a parabola, specifically f(x) = x², which is a standard upward-opening parabola with vertex at (0,0). Translating it would shift it horizontally and/or vertically. The general form after translation would be g(x) = (x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the shift vector.

Now, the question is to find the equation for g(x). To determine h and k, we need more information. The given predicates mention Points A and B as vertices of shapes f and g. Assuming that f is the original parabola, its vertex is at A, which might be (0,0). Then, the translated shape g has vertex at B. So if A is (0,0), then B would be (h, k), which is the new vertex after translation. 

Additionally, the Equals(0,0) and Equals(-2,1) might represent coordinates of these points. For example, if A is (0,0), then the vertex of f(x) is at (0,0). If B is (-2,1), then the vertex of g(x) would be at (-2,1), leading to the equation g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 1. 

But how do we confirm this? Let's check the predicates. There's an Equals(0,0) and Equals(-2,1). These likely refer to coordinates. So if A is the vertex of f(x), which is (0,0), then the point A has coordinates (0,0). Point B is the vertex of g(x), which would be (-2,1), hence the translation is h = -2, k = 1. Therefore, the equation for g(x) is (x + 2)^2 + 1. Expanding that gives x² + 4x + 5. 

However, the answer choices are not given, but according to the instructions, the user said there are no choices. Wait, the original message said "Answer Choices: No choices found." So the user expects us to provide the answer directly. But the system prompt says to choose from options A-D, but since there are no choices, perhaps the answer is expected to be in the form of an equation. But the final answer should be one of the letters. Wait, the initial problem didn't list answer choices, but the user included "Answer Choices: No choices found." So perhaps the intended answer is to derive the equation and present it as the final answer, but the system requires choosing between A-D. But without knowing the options, this is confusing. However, the user's instruction says to write the equation for g(x), which would be in the form of a quadratic function.

Assuming that the translation moves the vertex from (0,0) to (-2,1), then the equation would be g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 1. Expanding this, it becomes x² + 4x + 5. However, depending on the translation direction, if the translation vector is (-2,1), then yes. But how do we know that the translation vector is (-2,1)?

Looking back at the Equals predicates: Equals(0,0) and Equals(-2,1). These could represent the coordinates of points A and B. Since A is a vertex of f, which is the original parabola, then A is (0,0). Point B is a vertex of g, so it's the translated point. If B's coordinates are (-2,1), then the translation is moving the vertex from (0,0) to (-2,1), so the translation vector is (-2,1). Therefore, the equation of g(x) would be f(x - h) + k, where h and k are the components of the translation vector. Wait, no—if the graph is shifted left by 2 units and up by 1 unit, then the transformation is replacing x with x + 2 (since shifting left by 2 is equivalent to subtracting -2 from x), and adding 1. So the equation becomes g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 1.

Thus, the final answer should be g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 1, which simplifies to x² + 4x + 5. But since the answer choices aren't provided, and the user instructed to pick one of A-D, but there are none, perhaps the actual answer is presented as an expression. However, the system requires selecting one of A-D, but since there are no choices, this is unclear. However, based on the given information, the equation for g(x) is (x + 2)^2 + 1. If this were an option, say option A, then the answer would be A. But since there are no choices listed, I have to assume that the correct answer is this expression, and thus follow the required format.
