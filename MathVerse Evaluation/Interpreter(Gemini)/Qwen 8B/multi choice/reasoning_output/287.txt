Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question says there's a triangle with two acute angles of 27 and 52 degrees, and an external angle called ∠1. We need to find the measure of ∠1. The options are A:21, B:27, C:52, D:79.

First, I need to recall some basics about triangles and angles. I know that the sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. But wait, here they mention an external angle. Hmm, external angles... Right, an external angle of a triangle is formed by one side of the triangle and the extension of another side. Also, there's a theorem that says the measure of an external angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. Is that right? Let me confirm. Yes, the exterior angle theorem states that an exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles.

So, if we have a triangle with two known angles, 27° and 52°, then the third interior angle can be found first. Let me calculate that. Sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, so 27 + 52 = 79°, so the third angle would be 180 - 79 = 101°. Wait, but the problem mentions an external angle as ∠1. So maybe ∠1 is that external angle?

But how does that relate to the given angles? Let me think. Suppose the triangle has angles 27°, 52°, and 101°. Now, if we take an external angle at one of the vertices, say at the vertex where the 101° angle is. Then, the external angle would be supplementary to the internal angle. So, if the internal angle is 101°, the external angle would be 180 - 101 = 79°. Alternatively, if the external angle was taken at one of the other angles, like the 27° or 52°, then the external angle would be 180 - 27 = 153° or 180 - 52 = 128°, but those don't match the answer choices. 

Wait, but the problem says "an external angle as ∠1". Maybe ∠1 is referring to the external angle formed by extending one of the sides. Let me visualize the triangle. Let's assume the triangle ABC with angles at A=27°, B=52°, and C=101°. If we extend side BC beyond point C, forming an external angle at C. That external angle would be adjacent to angle C (which is 101°). Therefore, the external angle would be 180 - 101 = 79°, which is the same as the sum of the other two angles (27 + 52 = 79). So according to the exterior angle theorem, that external angle (∠1) should equal the sum of the remote interior angles, which are 27° and 52°, adding up to 79°. Hence, ∠1 is 79°, which corresponds to option D.

Alternatively, could ∠1 be an external angle at a different vertex? For example, if we extended a different side. Suppose we take the external angle at vertex A (where the 27° angle is). Then, the external angle would be 180 - 27 = 153°, but that's not among the answer choices. Similarly, extending at vertex B (with 52°), gives 128°, also not listed. Therefore, the only possibility is the external angle at the third vertex (the 101° angle), giving 79°, which is option D.

Therefore, the measure of ∠1 is 79°, so the correct answer is D.
