MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have two lines, a and b, intersecting at point O. Angle 1 is given as 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 2. The options are A:50°, B:40°, C:140°, D:130°.

First, I remember that when two lines intersect, they form vertical angles which are equal. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Let me visualize this. If lines a and b cross at point O, they create four angles around that point. Let's say angle 1 is one of those angles. Since vertical angles are equal, if angle 1 is 50°, its opposite angle would also be 50°. Then the other two angles, which are adjacent to angle 1, would each be 180° - 50° = 130°. Wait, but angle 2 could be either one of these. But depending on how the angles are labeled, maybe angle 2 is adjacent to angle 1? Or perhaps it's one of the vertical angles?

Wait, the problem mentions angle 1 and angle 2. Maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are adjacent? Let me think again. When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. Each pair is equal. So if angle 1 is one of them, angle 2 could be its vertical angle or one of the adjacent angles. But since the problem says angle 1 is 50°, then if angle 2 is vertical to angle 1, it would also be 50°, which is option A. However, if angle 2 is adjacent, then it would be 180° - 50° = 130°, which is option D. But the answer choices include both A and D. Hmm, so I need to figure out which one angle 2 refers to.

Wait, maybe there's more context. The problem says "as shown in the figure," but since there's no figure, I have to assume standard labeling. Typically, when two lines intersect, angles across from each other are vertical angles. So if angle 1 is one of the vertical angles, angle 2 could be another. But without seeing the figure, maybe angle 2 is adjacent? Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary? Let me check the possible scenarios.

Alternatively, perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are part of a triangle? Wait, no, because the lines are straight, so they form vertical angles. Let me recall the vertical angles theorem. Vertical angles are always equal. Adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle 1 is 50°, then the vertical angle opposite to it is also 50°, and the two adjacent angles would each be 130°. Therefore, angle 2 could be either 50° or 130°, depending on its position. 

But the answer choices don't have 130° as an option except D. Wait, looking back at the options: D is 130°, so maybe angle 2 is the adjacent angle. But why would angle 2 be adjacent? Unless the problem labels angle 1 and angle 2 as adjacent. For example, if angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the intersection, and angle 2 is next to it. In that case, angle 2 would be 180 - 50 = 130°, making answer D. But if angle 2 is vertical to angle 1, then it's 50°, which is option A. 

Hmm, this ambiguity suggests that maybe there's more context. Wait, the problem states "straight lines a and b intersect at point O." So, the angles around point O would be two pairs of vertical angles. If angle 1 is one of them, then angle 2 could be either vertical or adjacent. Without knowing the diagram, but considering common problems, sometimes angle 1 and angle 2 refer to adjacent angles. For instance, if angle 1 is 50°, then angle 2 (adjacent) would be 130°, which is option D. But maybe angle 2 is the vertical angle? That would make it 50°, option A. 

Wait, but the problem says "angle 2 is equal to..." So maybe angle 2 is referring to the vertical angle? But why would angle 2 be called angle 2? Or perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are adjacent? Let me think again. Suppose angle 1 is formed by lines a and b, and angle 2 is adjacent to it. Then angle 1 + angle 2 = 180°, so angle 2 = 130°, which is D. But if angle 2 is vertical to angle 1, then it's 50°, which is A. 

Wait, but maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are not adjacent. Let me consider another possibility. If the lines are intersecting, forming four angles. Let's name them as follows: angle 1 and angle 3 are vertical angles, and angle 2 and angle 4 are vertical angles. If angle 1 is 50°, then angle 3 is 50°, and angles 2 and 4 are 130° each. So angle 2 would be 130°, which is D. So the answer should be D. 

But wait, maybe angle 2 is one of the vertical angles? Like, if angle 1 is 50°, then angle 2 could be the vertical angle, making it 50°, which is A. But that seems conflicting. How do we know which one angle 2 refers to? 

Since the problem doesn't specify the diagram, but in many cases, when two lines intersect, angles are labeled in order. For example, imagine the intersection creating angles numbered clockwise as 1, 2, 3, 4. If angle 1 is the first one, then angle 2 would be the next one, adjacent to it, making them supplementary. Hence, angle 2 would be 180 - 50 = 130°, which is D. 

Therefore, the answer is D:130°. But wait, some sources may label vertical angles as 1 and 3, and 2 and 4. So if angle 1 is 50°, then angle 2 could be vertical to angle 1, making it 50°, but that's conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses angle 1 and angle 2 as two different angles formed by the intersection. If angle 1 is one of the smaller angles (like 50°), then angle 2 could be the larger one (130°). Therefore, the answer would be D. 

But I'm a bit confused here. Wait, maybe there's another way. If two lines intersect, the sum of all angles around the point is 360°. So, if angle 1 is 50°, and assuming angle 2 is another angle, then depending on their positions. If angle 1 and angle 2 are vertical, then they are equal. If they are adjacent, they are supplementary. 

But without the diagram, it's ambiguous. However, in typical textbook problems, when given two intersecting lines with one angle given, and asked about another angle, unless specified otherwise, angle 2 is often the adjacent angle. For example, if angle 1 is one angle, angle 2 is the adjacent one. Hence, 180-50=130, which is D. 

So I think the answer is D:130°. Therefore, the correct choice is D.
