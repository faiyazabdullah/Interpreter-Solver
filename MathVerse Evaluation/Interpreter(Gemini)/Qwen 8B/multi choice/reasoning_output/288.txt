MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a right triangle ABF on top of a rectangle CDEF. The question is asking for the measure of angle 2, which is labeled as ∠CFD. The answer choices are A:39, B:42, C:48, D:51. 

First, I need to parse all the given predicates. Let me list them out again. There are points A, B, C, D, E, F. Lines connecting them form a triangle ABF and a rectangle CDEF. Also, there are several right angles mentioned: Angle AFB, CDE, EFA, BCD are right angles. Additionally, some measures: MeasureOf(Angle ABF) is 48 degrees, MeasureOf(Angle EDF) is 39 degrees. Then there are some parallel and perpendicular relationships. For example, Line BC is parallel to DE, FC is parallel to ED. Also, AF is perpendicular to BF, FC is perpendicular to CD, DE is perpendicular to EF. 

Wait, so the main shapes here are Triangle ABF and Rectangle CDEF. Since it's stated that ABF is a right triangle, and since there are right angles at AFB, CDE, EFA, BCD. Also, the rectangle has sides CD, DE, EF, FC. Given that, maybe we need to find relations between these angles. 

Let me sketch mentally. The triangle ABF is right-angled at F because Angle AFB is a right angle. Wait, but the problem says Right(Triangle ABF), so that means the right angle is at F? Because in a right triangle, the right angle is the one that's 90 degrees. But according to the MeasureOf(Angle ABF) is 48 degrees. Wait, Angle ABF would be at point B. So if triangle ABF is right-angled, then the right angle must be at F, making angle AFB the right angle. Therefore, angles at A and B are acute. Given that angle ABF (at B) is 48 degrees. So in triangle ABF, angles sum to 180. So angle at F is 90°, angle at B is 48°, so angle at A would be 180 - 90 - 48 = 42 degrees. So angle BAF is 42 degrees. Hmm, but how does that relate to the rest?

Now, looking at the rectangle CDEF. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles. So each corner is 90 degrees. However, there are also mentions of certain angles being right angles. For instance, Angle CDE is a right angle. That makes sense because CDE is part of the rectangle. Similarly, EFA is a right angle. Wait, EFA—point E, F, A. But F is connected to C and A? Wait, the lines given are Line(F,C) and Line(E,F). So E-F-C is a side of the rectangle? Or wait, the rectangle is CDEF, so the vertices are C, D, E, F. So the sides are CD, DE, EF, FC. So C connected to D, D to E, E to F, F to C. Therefore, each angle in the rectangle is 90 degrees. So angle at D (CDE) is 90°, angle at E (DEF) is 90°, angle at F (EFC) is 90°, angle at C (DCF) is 90°. 

But then, there's also mention of Angle EFA being a right angle. Wait, EFA is the angle at point F between points E, F, A. But in the rectangle, F is connected to E and C. So angle EFA is formed by lines FE and FA. Wait, FE is part of the rectangle (FE is a side of the rectangle), and FA is the hypotenuse of the triangle ABF. So angle EFA is a right angle. Which implies that FE is perpendicular to FA. But FE is a side of the rectangle, which is horizontal? Not sure yet. 

Also, given that Line AF is perpendicular to Line BF. Because Perpendicular(Line(AF), Line(BF)) is given. Since AF is part of triangle ABF, which is right-angled at F, so AF and BF are the legs of the right triangle. Thus, they are perpendicular. 

So, moving on. Now, the problem states that ∠CFD is labeled as ∠2. So point C, F, D. So angle at point F between points C, F, D. Wait, but F is connected to C and E. Wait, in the rectangle CDEF, F is connected to C and E. So angle at F between C and E is 90 degrees. But the question is about angle CFD. Wait, point D is connected to E and C. So angle CFD would be at point F, between points C, F, D. Wait, but point D is connected to E and C. So FD is not a side of the rectangle. Wait, maybe FD connects F to D? But in the rectangle, the sides are CD, DE, EF, FC. So FD is a diagonal? Or perhaps another line? Wait, the problem doesn't mention FD as a line. Wait, but maybe there's a connection between F and D? Because the rectangle is CDEF, so the diagonals would be CE and DF. Wait, but the problem doesn't state that FD is a line. Wait, but angle CFD is formed by points C, F, D. So lines FC and FD. But FD is not necessarily a side of the rectangle. Unless FD is a diagonal. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again. The rectangle is CDEF. So the four corners are C, D, E, F. So edges are CD, DE, EF, FC. Therefore, point F is connected to C and E. Point D is connected to C and E. So to get angle CFD, we need lines FC and FD. But FD isn't a side of the rectangle. So FD is a diagonal from F to D. So in the rectangle, the diagonals are CF and DE? Wait, no. In rectangle CDEF, the diagonals connect opposite corners. So diagonals are CE and DF. So yes, DF is a diagonal from D to F. Therefore, angle CFD is the angle at F between points C and D. So that would be the angle between FC and FD. But FC is a side of the rectangle (from F to C), and FD is the diagonal from F to D. So angle CFD is formed by the side FC and the diagonal FD. 

To find the measure of angle CFD (∠2), we need to find the angle between FC and FD. Since FC is a side of the rectangle, which is perpendicular to CD (since it's a rectangle). Also, FD is a diagonal. Maybe we can use coordinates to model this. Alternatively, use trigonometry. 

But first, let's see what other info we have. We know that in the rectangle, CD is equal to EF, and DE equals FC. From the given Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), LengthOf(Line(E,F))) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)), LengthOf(Line(F,C))). So the rectangle has opposite sides equal. 

Additionally, we have some angles given. MeasureOf(Angle EDF) is 39 degrees. Wait, Angle EDF is at point D, between points E, D, F. Since D is a vertex of the rectangle, and E and F are adjacent to D. Wait, in rectangle CDEF, point D is connected to C and E. So angle at D is between CD and DE. But angle EDF is the angle at D between E, D, F. Wait, but F is not directly connected to D. Wait, unless there's a line from D to F. Wait, but earlier we thought that DF is a diagonal. So angle EDF would be the angle at D between E, D, F. So that's the angle between DE and DF. Since DE is a side of the rectangle (from D to E), and DF is the diagonal from D to F. 

Given that MeasureOf(Angle EDF) is 39 degrees. So in triangle DEF, angle at D is 39 degrees. Wait, but DEF is part of the rectangle? Wait, in rectangle CDEF, the sides are CD, DE, EF, FC. So point D is connected to C and E. Then, point F is connected to E and C. So if we consider triangle D-E-F, but in reality, DE is a side, EF is a side, and DF is a diagonal. So triangle DEF is a triangle with DE and EF as sides of the rectangle, and DF as the diagonal. Therefore, in triangle DEF, angle at D is 39 degrees. 

Since DE and EF are sides of the rectangle, they are perpendicular. Because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So DE is perpendicular to EF. Therefore, triangle DEF is a right triangle at E. Therefore, angle at E is 90 degrees. So in triangle DEF, angle at D is 39 degrees, angle at E is 90 degrees, so angle at F is 180 - 39 - 90 = 51 degrees. So angle DFE is 51 degrees. 

But angle DFE is the angle at F between D, F, E. But earlier, we had that angle EFA is a right angle. Wait, angle EFA is at F between E, F, A. So that's different. 

But how does this relate to angle CFD? Let's think again. 

We need to find angle CFD, which is at point F between C, F, D. So that's the angle between FC and FD. Since FC is a side of the rectangle (from F to C), and FD is the diagonal from F to D. So, in triangle CFD, we have FC as one side, FD as another, and CD as the third. Wait, but CD is a side of the rectangle. 

Alternatively, considering triangle DFC. Wait, but D is connected to C and E. So maybe triangle DFC? Let me visualize. Points C, D, F. So in the rectangle, CD is a side, DF is a diagonal, and FC is another side. So triangle DFC is formed by CD, DF, FC. But since CD and FC are sides of the rectangle, they are perpendicular. Because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So CD is perpendicular to FC. Therefore, triangle DFC is a right triangle at C. Wait, but angle at C is between DC and FC, which is 90 degrees. So in triangle DFC, right-angled at C. 

Therefore, angle at F (which is angle CFD) can be found using the triangle. If we can find the lengths of sides, we can compute the angle. 

But how do we find those lengths? Well, we know that in triangle DEF, angle at D is 39 degrees, angle at E is 90 degrees, angle at F is 51 degrees. And since DE and EF are sides of the rectangle, which are equal to FC and CD respectively. Wait, from the given Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,E)), LengthOf(Line(F,C))). So DE equals FC. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(C,D)), LengthOf(Line(E,F))). So CD equals EF. 

In the rectangle CDEF, DE is one side, EF is another. Since it's a rectangle, DE equals CF (as per the equality given), and CD equals EF. Wait, maybe I should assign variables. Let me denote the length of CD as x, DE as y. Then, since it's a rectangle, CD = EF = x, DE = CF = y. 

Then, in triangle DEF, which is right-angled at E, with legs DE = y and EF = x. So angle at D is 39 degrees. Therefore, tan(angle at D) = opposite over adjacent. In triangle DEF, angle at D is 39 degrees, opposite side is EF = x, adjacent side is DE = y. Therefore, tan(39°) = x / y. 

Similarly, in triangle DFC, which is right-angled at C, with legs CD = x and CF = y. Therefore, angle at F (which is angle CFD) would satisfy tan(angle CFD) = opposite / adjacent = CD / CF = x / y. Wait, same ratio as before. Therefore, angle CFD is equal to angle at D in triangle DEF, which is 39 degrees. But wait, that would imply angle CFD is 39 degrees, which is answer A. But wait, that seems conflicting with something. Wait, let me check again. 

Wait, in triangle DEF, angle at D is 39°, and tan(angle D) = EF / DE = x/y. In triangle DFC, angle at F is angle CFD, where tan(angle CFD) = CD / CF = x / y. Therefore, angle CFD = angle D in triangle DEF, which is 39 degrees. So angle 2 is 39 degrees, which corresponds to answer A. 

But wait, why is that? Because in triangle DEF, angle at D is 39°, and in triangle DFC, angle at F is also determined by the same ratio of sides. Hence, they are equal. Therefore, angle CFD is 39 degrees. 

But wait, the answer choices include A as 39. So that would suggest answer A. However, the initial thought was that angle DFE is 51 degrees. But angle DFE is at F between D, F, E. While angle CFD is at F between C, F, D. These are two different angles. 

But according to the above reasoning, angle CFD is 39 degrees. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me re-examine. 

In triangle DEF, which is right-angled at E, with DE = y, EF = x. So angle at D is 39°, so tan(39°) = EF / DE = x/y. 

In triangle DFC, which is right-angled at C, with legs CD = x and CF = y. Therefore, angle at F (angle CFD) is such that tan(angle CFD) = CD / CF = x / y. Therefore, angle CFD = arctan(x/y) = 39°, same as angle D in triangle DEF. Therefore, angle 2 is 39°, answer A. 

But wait, the problem states that angle EDF is 39°, which is angle at D. So angle CFD is 39°, answer A. But why is this the case? Is there another way to look at it? 

Alternatively, maybe there's more to this. Let me check if there are other relationships. For instance, triangle ABF has angle ABF = 48°, angle at B. Earlier, we deduced that angle at A is 42°, angle at F is 90°. 

But how does triangle ABF relate to the rectangle? Are there any connections between the triangle and the rectangle? For instance, point F is shared between the triangle and the rectangle. Also, line AF is part of the triangle and is perpendicular to BF. 

But maybe the key lies in the fact that AF is perpendicular to BF, and that FE is perpendicular to AF (since angle EFA is a right angle). Therefore, FE is parallel to BF? Because if AF is perpendicular to both BF and FE, then BF and FE are parallel. 

Wait, if AF ⊥ BF and AF ⊥ FE, then BF is parallel to FE. Because if two lines are both perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. 

But in the rectangle, FE is a side, and BF is... Wait, BF is a line from B to F. But in the rectangle, FE is a side from F to E. So BF is not necessarily aligned with FE. However, if they are parallel, then their slopes would be the same. 

But maybe this is complicating things. Let's return to the previous conclusion that angle CFD is 39°, hence answer A. However, the options include A:39, which would make that the answer. But sometimes problems have tricks. Let me verify once more. 

Another approach: since the rectangle has sides CD and CF, which are perpendicular. So in triangle DFC, right-angled at C, angle at F is angle CFD. The tangent of that angle is CD / CF. But from the rectangle, CD equals EF, and CF equals DE. So CD / CF = EF / DE. But in triangle DEF, which is right-angled at E, tan(angle at D) = EF / DE = tan(39°). Therefore, CD / CF = tan(39°), leading to angle CFD = 39°. 

Yes, that seems consistent. Therefore, angle 2 is 39°, answer A. 

Wait, but why is the problem mentioning the triangle ABF with angle ABF = 48°? Does that affect anything? Maybe not directly, unless there's some relation between the triangles. For example, could there be similar triangles? 

For instance, if AF is perpendicular to BF, and FE is perpendicular to AF, then FE is parallel to BF. If that's true, then BF || FE. Then, since FE is a side of the rectangle, which is horizontal (assuming standard orientation), BF would be parallel to FE. But without knowing specific coordinates, it's hard to say. However, the presence of angle ABF = 48° may not directly impact the calculation of angle CFD. 

Thus, the answer should be 39°, which is option A. However, I need to make sure there's no alternative interpretation. 

Wait, another possibility: angle CFD is not in triangle DFC. Suppose that angle CFD is actually referring to angle at F between C, F, D. Since in the rectangle, F is connected to C and E. So the line FD goes from F to D. So FD is a diagonal. So in triangle CFD, angle at F is between FC and FD. Since FC is vertical (if we imagine the rectangle standing upright), and FD is a diagonal going down to D. 

But regardless of orientation, the calculation via tan remains. So angle CFD depends only on the ratio of CD to CF, which gives us 39°. 

Hence, the answer is A.
