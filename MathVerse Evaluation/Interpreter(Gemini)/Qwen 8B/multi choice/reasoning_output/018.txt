MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have four lines a, b, c, d, and some angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4. The given measures are angle 1 and 2 are both 58 degrees, angle 3 is 70 degrees. We need to find angle 4. Also, lines a and b are parallel. 

First, I should recall that when two lines are parallel, certain angle relationships come into play. Like corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, same-side interior angles, etc. But since there are four lines here, maybe they form some kind of transversal setup? Let me visualize it. Maybe lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d are transversals cutting them?

Wait, but without seeing the actual figure, I have to deduce based on the angles given. Let me think about how these angles could be positioned. Since angle 1 and 2 are equal (both 58 degrees), perhaps they are corresponding or alternate interior angles formed by a transversal. Similarly, angle 3 is 70 degrees. Maybe angle 3 is part of a triangle or another set of intersecting lines.

Let me consider that lines a and b are parallel. Suppose line c intersects both a and b, creating some angles. Then line d might intersect one or both of those lines. Alternatively, maybe lines c and d are also parallel? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved where some angles are given. For example, if angle 3 is part of a triangle with angles 1 and 2. Wait, but angle 3 is 70 degrees. Let me think about triangle angle sum. If three angles add up to 180, but if angle 1 and 2 are each 58, then adding them gives 116, so the third angle would be 64. But that doesn't seem directly related unless angle 3 is connected to that.

Wait, but angle 3 is given as 70 degrees. Maybe angle 3 is supplementary to angle 4? Or maybe there's a vertical angles relationship. Another thought: if lines a and b are parallel, and line c is a transversal, then consecutive interior angles would add up to 180 degrees. If angle 1 is one of those, then its supplement would be another angle. But angle 2 is also 58 degrees. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there's a diagram where lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d are transversals forming different angles. Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose line c crosses line a at point A, creating an angle, say angle 1 (58 degrees). Then line c crosses line b at another point, making another angle. If lines a and b are parallel, then the corresponding angles would be equal. So if angle 1 is on line a, then the corresponding angle on line b would also be 58 degrees. But angle 2 is also 58 degrees. Maybe angle 2 is that corresponding angle?

But then angle 3 is 70 degrees. Where does that fit in? Maybe angle 3 is part of a different intersection. For instance, if line d is another transversal, crossing lines a and b. Suppose line d creates angle 3 with line a, which is 70 degrees. Then, if lines a and b are parallel, the corresponding angle on line b would also be 70 degrees. However, how does angle 4 relate to these?

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is a vertical angle or supplementary angle to one of these. Let's think about the possibilities. If lines c and d are intersecting, forming various angles. Suppose angle 3 is formed at the intersection of lines c and d, but I need more precise relations.

Another approach: since angle 1 and 2 are equal, maybe they are vertical angles or alternate interior angles. If lines a and b are parallel, then if line c is a transversal, then alternate interior angles would be equal. So if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle to angle 2, then that would explain why they're equal. Then angle 3 being 70 degrees could be adjacent to angle 1 or something like that.

Wait, suppose lines a and b are horizontal, and line c is a transversal crossing them, making angle 1 at the top of line a and angle 2 at the bottom of line b. Since lines a and b are parallel, those angles would be equal. Then angle 3 could be another angle formed by line d. Maybe line d is another transversal, creating angle 3 and angle 4. If angle 3 is 70 degrees, then depending on the position, angle 4 could be supplementary or something else.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 and angle 4 are part of a triangle. For example, if angle 3 is one angle of a triangle, and angle 1 and 2 are other angles. But angle 1 + angle 2 + angle 3 = 58 + 58 + 70 = 186, which is way over 180, so that's impossible. So probably not a triangle.

Wait, maybe there's a quadrilateral involved. In a quadrilateral, the sum of angles is 360 degrees. If angles 1, 2, 3, and 4 are the four angles of a quadrilateral, then angle 4 would be 360 - (58+58+70) = 360 - 186 = 174. But that's not among the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe angle 4 is part of a linear pair with angle 3. If angle 3 is 70 degrees, then angle 4 could be 110 degrees because they are supplementary. But wait, 70 + 110 is 180. That's possible. But then why is angle 1 and 2 given? How do they factor in?

Wait, maybe angle 4 is formed by the intersection of lines c and d. Let's think again. If lines a and b are parallel, and line c is a transversal making angle 1 (58 degrees) with line a. Then line d could be another transversal making angle 3 (70 degrees) with line a. Then, angle 4 could be the angle between lines c and d. But how?

Alternatively, think about the lines forming a 'Z' shape with the parallel lines. If line c is a transversal, then angle 1 and angle 2 could be on different sides. Maybe angle 3 is an exterior angle. Wait, this is getting confusing without the exact figure.

Let me try applying the properties of parallel lines. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle 1 is one such angle, then its consecutive interior angle would be 180 - 58 = 122 degrees. But angle 2 is 58 degrees, so maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, if angle 3 is formed by another transversal, say line d, crossing lines a and b. Then, if line d forms angle 3 with line a, which is 70 degrees, then the corresponding angle on line b would also be 70 degrees. Now, if line c and line d intersect at some point, forming angle 4. Depending on their arrangement, angle 4 could be the sum or difference of angles 1, 2, or 3.

Wait, another possibility: angle 4 is vertically opposite to angle 3, so it would be 70 degrees. But that's option B. However, given that angles 1 and 2 are 58 degrees, maybe angle 4 is formed by combining angles from the transversals. For example, if angle 1 and angle 3 are adjacent, then angle 4 could be their sum. But 58 + 70 = 128, which isn't an option. Or maybe angle 4 is the supplement of angle 3 plus angle 1? Not sure.

Wait, maybe angle 4 is an exterior angle to a triangle formed by the transversals. For example, if lines c and d intersect at a point, and line a is parallel to line b, then maybe angle 4 is an exterior angle. Exterior angles are equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. If angle 1 and angle 3 are the remote interior angles, then angle 4 would be 58 + 70 = 128. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, angle 4 could be a vertical angle to the sum of angles 1 and 3 minus something. This seems too vague.

Wait, maybe angle 4 is supplementary to angle 1. If angle 1 is 58, then angle 4 would be 122. But that's not an option either. The options are 58, 70, 110, 116. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. Since lines a and b are parallel, and assuming that lines c and d are transversals. Suppose line c intersects line a at angle 1 (58 degrees), and line d intersects line a at angle 3 (70 degrees). Then, the angle between lines c and d would depend on their direction. If lines c and d are intersecting, then the angles around their intersection would follow certain rules.

For instance, if line c and line d meet at a point, forming vertical angles. Suppose angle 3 is 70 degrees, and angle 1 is 58 degrees. Maybe angle 4 is formed by the intersection of lines c and d. If angle 3 and angle 1 are adjacent, then angle 4 could be 70 + 58 = 128. Still not matching. Or maybe angle 4 is the difference between 180 and the sum of 58 and 70, which is 180 - 128 = 52. No.

Alternatively, if angle 4 is a corresponding angle to angle 3, then it would be 70 degrees. But that's option B. But why would angle 4 be corresponding to angle 3? Unless lines a and b are parallel, and line d is a transversal, making angle 3 and angle 4 corresponding. But then angle 4 would be 70 degrees. But the presence of angles 1 and 2 complicates things. Maybe angle 4 is actually the supplement of angle 1? 180 - 58 = 122. Not an option. 

Wait, looking back at the options, 110 and 116 are close to 180 - 70 = 110. So maybe angle 4 is supplementary to angle 3. If angle 3 is 70, then angle 4 is 110. Which is option C. But how does angle 1 and 2 come into play here?

Maybe angle 4 is formed by extending lines or considering other intersections. Let me think of a scenario where angle 1 and angle 2 are equal due to parallel lines. Suppose line c is a transversal, creating angle 1 (58 degrees) on line a, and angle 2 (also 58 degrees) on line b. Then line d is another transversal that creates angle 3 (70 degrees) on line a. Then, the intersection of lines c and d would form angle 4. 

In that case, if angle 3 is 70 degrees on line a, and line c has an angle of 58 degrees, then the angle between lines c and d would be 70 - 58 = 12 degrees? No, that's not likely. Or maybe the sum? 70 + 58 = 128. Still not matching.

Alternatively, if lines c and d are forming a triangle with line a or b. For example, if lines c and d meet at a point, and line a is parallel to line b, then angle 4 could be an exterior angle. Suppose angle 1 and angle 3 are the remote interior angles, then angle 4 would be their sum. But 58 + 70 = 128, which isn't an option. 

Wait, maybe angle 4 is the vertical angle opposite to angle 3, which would make it 70 degrees. But then why are angles 1 and 2 given? Unless they are distractions or part of another relation. 

This is tricky. Maybe I need to use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. Suppose lines c and d intersect at a point, forming four angles. If angle 3 is one of them (70 degrees), then the opposite angle is also 70 degrees. The other two angles would be supplementary to angle 3, so 110 degrees each. If angle 4 is one of those, then it would be 110 degrees, which is option C. But how does angle 1 and 2 fit in here? 

Perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are related to the other angles formed by the intersection of lines c and d. For example, if angle 1 is one of the angles created by lines c and d, then maybe it's 58 degrees, and angle 2 is another angle. But this requires knowing the exact configuration.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is formed by the intersection of lines c and d, where one angle is 70 degrees (angle 3) and another angle is 58 degrees (angle 1 or 2), leading to angle 4 being 180 - 70 - 58 = 52, which isn't an option. 

Wait, another idea: if lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d are transversals, then the sum of angle 1 and angle 3 could be used to find angle 4. For instance, if angle 1 and angle 3 are consecutive interior angles, then they would be supplementary. But 58 + 70 = 128, which isn't 180. So that doesn't hold. 

Alternatively, if angle 4 is the sum of angle 1 and angle 3. 58 + 70 = 128. Still not matching. 

Wait, what if angle 4 is formed by a transversal that creates an angle with line a, and line a is parallel to line b. Suppose line d intersects line a at angle 3 (70 degrees), and line d intersects line b at angle 4. Since lines a and b are parallel, the corresponding angles would be equal, so angle 4 would be 70 degrees. But then why are angles 1 and 2 given? Maybe they are part of a different transversal. 

Alternatively, if lines c and d are not parallel, but intersect each other, forming a triangle with lines a and b. For example, lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d intersect them, creating a trapezoid. The angles inside the trapezoid would have certain properties. 

But without seeing the figure, this is challenging. Given the answer choices, and common geometric problems, angle 4 might be supplementary to angle 3, making it 110 degrees (option C). Or it could be the sum of angles 1 and 2, which is 116 degrees (option D). 

Since angle 1 and 2 are both 58, their sum is 116. If angle 4 is formed by the intersection of lines c and d, and those angles are vertical angles or something related to the sum of angles 1 and 2. 

Wait, another thought: if lines a and b are parallel, and line c is a transversal creating angle 1 (58 degrees), then the alternate interior angle would also be 58 degrees. Line d could be another transversal creating angle 3 (70 degrees) with line a. At the intersection of lines c and d, angle 4 would be the sum of angle 1 and angle 3, which is 128. Not an option. Or maybe angle 4 is the difference between 180 and angle 1 plus angle 3. 

Alternatively, if angle 4 is a vertical angle to the sum of angles 1 and 3. Wait, this is too vague. 

Given that angle 3 is 70 degrees, and angles 1 and 2 are 58 degrees each, and the options include 110 and 116, which are close to 180-70=110 and 180-58=122. Maybe angle 4 is the supplement of angle 3 (110) or the supplement of angle 1 (122). But neither of these are options except for 110, which is option C. 

But why would angle 4 be supplementary to angle 3? If lines a and b are parallel, and line d is a transversal making angle 3 with line a, then the consecutive interior angle with respect to line b would be supplementary to angle 3. So angle 4 could be 180-70=110 degrees. That fits option C. 

Yes, that makes sense! Because if line d intersects line a at angle 3 (70 degrees), then the consecutive interior angle on line b would be supplementary to angle 3. Since lines a and b are parallel, that angle would be 180-70=110 degrees, which is angle 4. Hence, the answer is C.
