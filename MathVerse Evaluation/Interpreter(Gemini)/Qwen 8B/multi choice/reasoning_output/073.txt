MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle O. Angle ABC is given as 70 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle AOC. Let me recall some circle theorems that might help here.

First, since ABC is an inscribed triangle in circle O, that means all three vertices A, B, and C lie on the circumference of the circle. The center of the circle is point O. Now, angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Wait, but angle at B is part of triangle ABC. The question asks about angle AOC, which is the central angle subtended by arc AC. 

I remember that there's a relationship between inscribed angles and central angles. Specifically, the central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc. But wait, angle ABC is an inscribed angle that subtends arc AC. Because in triangle ABC, angle at B is formed by points A and C, so it subtends arc AC. Therefore, the central angle over arc AC would be twice that. 

So if angle ABC is 70 degrees, then the central angle AOC should be 2*70 = 140 degrees. That would make the answer A. But let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes the arcs can be major or minor arcs. But in this case, since ABC is a triangle inscribed in the circle, the arc AC that's subtended by angle B should be the one that's opposite to B. Since angle B is 70 degrees, which is acute, the arc AC would be less than 180 degrees? Or maybe not necessarily. Wait, actually, the measure of the inscribed angle depends on the arc it subtends. If angle ABC is 70 degrees, then the arc AC would be 140 degrees. Therefore, the central angle AOC, which subtends the same arc AC, would indeed be 140 degrees. 

But hold on, could there be another way to look at this? For example, maybe considering other angles or properties. Let me think again. The triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with O as the center. So OA, OB, OC are radii of the circle. Therefore, triangle AOC is an isosceles triangle with OA=OC. The angle at O is angle AOC, which we're trying to find. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of the central angles around point O is 360 degrees. However, without knowing other angles, that might not directly help. But if angle ABC is 70 degrees, then the arc AC is 140 degrees. Therefore, angle AOC, being the central angle, is equal to the measure of arc AC, which is 140 degrees. 

Another check: In a circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc. Since angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC, then yes, angle AOC is twice that. So 2*70=140. Therefore, the answer should be A:140°. 

Let me confirm once more. Suppose ABC is a triangle inscribed in a circle. The angle at B is 70 degrees. Then the arc AC is 140 degrees. Hence, the central angle AOC is 140 degrees. Yes, that seems correct. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
