MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center O, and points A, B, and C on the circle. AB is a chord of the circle, and OC is perpendicular to AB, intersecting the circle at point C. We need to find the measure of angle AOB, given that angle ABC is 25 degrees.

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since OC is perpendicular to AB and passes through the center O, that means OC is the perpendicular bisector of AB. Wait, but OC intersects the circle at C, so maybe C is the midpoint? Or is there something else here?

Wait, AB is a chord, and OC is perpendicular to AB. In a circle, the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord. But here, OC is perpendicular to AB and meets the circle again at C. Hmm, so C is another point on the circle such that OC is perpendicular to AB. That would mean that OC is not just the bisector but also extends beyond the midpoint of AB to meet the circle again at C. 

But since O is the center, OA, OB, and OC are all radii. Therefore, OA = OB = OC. So triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle with OA = OB. Also, since OC is perpendicular to AB, triangle OAC and OBC might have some properties.

Given that angle ABC is 25 degrees. Let me think about triangle ABC. Point C is on the circle, so maybe there are some cyclic quadrilateral properties or inscribed angles here. Alternatively, considering triangle ABC, with AB being a chord and C on the circle. 

Let me try to draw a diagram mentally. Points A and B are on the circle, AB is a chord. OC is perpendicular to AB, passing through O and meeting the circle at C. So OC starts at the center O, goes perpendicularly to AB, and ends at point C on the circle. So C is diametrically opposite to the midpoint of AB? Not sure yet. 

Since OA, OB, and OC are radii, they are all equal. So OA = OB = OC. Now, looking at triangle OAB: since OA=OB, it's an isosceles triangle with base AB and vertex at O. The angle at O is angle AOB, which is what we need to find. 

Now, angle ABC is given as 25 degrees. Let's consider triangle ABC. Point C is on the circle, so maybe angle ABC relates to some arc measures. Since AB is a chord, and C is another point on the circle, perhaps angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Wait, inscribed angle subtended by arc AC or something?

Alternatively, since OC is perpendicular to AB, and O is the center, then OC is the perpendicular bisector of AB. Therefore, the midpoint of AB lies on OC. Let me denote M as the midpoint of AB. Then OM is part of OC, and since OC is a radius, OC has length equal to the radius. But since M is the midpoint of AB, OM is the distance from the center to the chord AB. However, since OC is a radius, and OC is perpendicular to AB, then C must lie along the line OM extended beyond M to the circumference. Wait, but OC is a radius, so starting at O, going through M (the midpoint) and ending at C. Therefore, OC is a radius, so its length is equal to the radius. But OM is the distance from center to chord AB, which is less than the radius unless AB is a diameter. Wait, but AB is a chord, not necessarily a diameter. So OC is a radius, so the total length from O to C is the radius. So M is somewhere between O and C, because OC is perpendicular to AB and passes through M. Wait, but if OC is a radius, then the entire segment OC is from O to C, which is a radius. Therefore, M is the midpoint of AB, lying on OC. Therefore, OM is part of OC. So OC is longer than OM, but OC is a radius. Wait, but how does that work? Because OM is the distance from the center to the chord AB, which is sqrt(r² - (AB/2)²). But OC is a radius, so OC = r. So the coordinates here... Maybe I need to use coordinate geometry?

Alternatively, since OC is perpendicular to AB, and O is the center, then triangle OMB is a right triangle, where M is the midpoint of AB. Wait, but OC is the line from O through M to C. So OM + MC = OC. But OC is a radius. However, without knowing the exact position, maybe I need another approach.

Looking back at the given angle ABC = 25 degrees. Let me focus on triangle ABC. Point C is on the circle, so ABC is an inscribed angle. Wait, AB is a chord, and C is another point on the circle. So angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Which arc does it subtend? Inscribed angle ABC subtends arc AC. Therefore, the measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc AC. So arc AC is 50 degrees. 

But arc AC is also related to other parts of the circle. Since OC is a radius and is perpendicular to AB, maybe we can relate arcs. Let me think. Let me consider the central angles. For example, angle AOC is the central angle corresponding to arc AC. Since OC is perpendicular to AB, and AB is a chord, maybe there's a relationship between angle AOC and angle ABC.

Alternatively, since angle ABC is 25 degrees, which is half of arc AC, so arc AC is 50 degrees. Then, the central angle AOC is equal to the measure of arc AC, which is 50 degrees. Therefore, angle AOC is 50 degrees. But wait, angle AOC is the central angle for arc AC, yes. 

But then, looking at triangle AOC, since OA and OC are both radii, triangle AOC is isosceles with OA = OC. Therefore, the base angles at A and C are equal. Wait, but angle AOC is 50 degrees, so the sum of the other two angles is 130 degrees. Each of those angles would be 65 degrees. But I'm not sure how that helps yet.

Wait, but earlier I thought that angle ABC is half of arc AC, so arc AC is 50 degrees. Then, if I can find the measure of arc AB or something else, maybe I can find angle AOB. 

But angle AOB is the central angle for arc AB. If I can find the measure of arc AB, then angle AOB equals that measure. How can I find arc AB? Well, maybe using other arcs. 

Alternatively, since OC is perpendicular to AB, then the arc AB could be related to the position of C. Since OC is perpendicular to AB, and C is on the circle. Let me think. The line OC is perpendicular to AB, so if I imagine the circle with AB as a horizontal chord, then OC is vertical, passing through the midpoint of AB. So, point C is directly above or below the midpoint of AB. But since OC is a radius, and C is on the circle, depending on whether it's above or below. 

Assuming the standard position, suppose AB is horizontal, O is the center, and OC is vertical upwards. Then, point C is the topmost point of the circle? No, not necessarily, unless AB is horizontal and OC is vertical. Wait, but AB is a chord, and OC is perpendicular to AB. So if AB is horizontal, then OC is vertical. But C is a point on the circle. Depending on where AB is located, the position of C varies. 

But maybe there's symmetry here. Let me think. If AB is a chord, and OC is perpendicular to AB at its midpoint M. Then, since OC is a radius, the length of OC is equal to the radius. But OM is the distance from the center to the chord AB, which is sqrt(r² - (AB/2)^2). But OC is a radius, so OM + MC = OC? Wait, no. If O is the center, and M is the midpoint of AB, then OM is the distance from O to AB. If C is along the line OM extended beyond M to the circle, then OC is a radius. Therefore, OM is part of OC. So OC = OM + MC? Or OM is part of OC? Wait, if O is the center, and OC is a radius pointing towards C, which is on the same line as OM. So, if AB is horizontal, and OC is vertical, then O is somewhere along the vertical line OC. So, if AB is horizontal, then the midpoint M of AB lies on OC. Therefore, O is between M and C? Or is M between O and C? It depends on where AB is placed. 

For instance, if AB is closer to the top of the circle, then the midpoint M would be near the top, and O is the center, so OC would extend from O through M to C. Wait, but OC is a radius. Suppose the circle has radius r. The distance from O to AB is d, so d = OM. Then, the length of OM is d, and the length OC is r. So, if C is on the line OM extended beyond M away from O, then OC = OM + MC. Wait, but OC is a radius, so OC = r. Therefore, if M is between O and C, then OM + MC = OC => d + MC = r. But I don't know the value of d here. 

However, maybe I can relate this to the angles. Since angle ABC is 25 degrees, which corresponds to arc AC being 50 degrees. So arc AC is 50 degrees. Then, since OC is a radius, and point C is on the circle, maybe there's a way to relate arc AC to other arcs. 

Let me consider the entire circle. The sum of arcs around the circle is 360 degrees. If arc AC is 50 degrees, then depending on where the other arcs are. But perhaps I need to look at triangle ABC. 

Alternatively, since AB is a chord, and OC is perpendicular to AB, then AB is symmetric with respect to OC. Therefore, maybe there's some reflection symmetry. 

Another approach: since OC is perpendicular to AB, then AB is horizontal, OC is vertical. Then, point C is either above or below AB. Assuming the usual orientation, maybe C is above AB. So, in this case, angle ABC is formed at point B, between points A, B, and C. 

So, in triangle ABC, angle at B is 25 degrees. Let me consider triangle ABC. Since AB is a chord and C is on the circle, maybe we can use the Law of Sines or Cosines. But I need more information about sides or other angles. 

Wait, but OA = OB = OC, since they're radii. So OA = OB = OC. Therefore, triangles OAB and OBC may have some relations. 

In triangle OAB, OA = OB, so it's isosceles. The angle at O is angle AOB, which we want to find. The base angles at A and B are equal. Let me call them x. So angle OAB = angle OBA = x. Then, angle AOB = 180 - 2x. 

But how does this relate to angle ABC? Let me see. Angle ABC is at point B, between points A, B, and C. So, angle ABC is adjacent to angle OBA. Because OBA is part of triangle OAB, and angle ABC includes that angle plus others. Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize: point B is connected to A and C. So angle ABC is part of triangle ABC. 

If I can express angle ABC in terms of other angles. For example, maybe considering triangle OBC. Since OB and OC are radii, triangle OBC is also isosceles with OB = OC. So angle OBC = angle OCB. 

Let me denote angle OBC as y. Then, in triangle OBC, angles at B and C are equal, so angle OBC = angle OCB = y. The third angle at O is angle BOC = 180 - 2y. 

Now, angle ABC is given as 25 degrees. How does angle ABC relate to angle OBC? At point B, angle ABC is composed of angle OBA (from triangle OAB) and angle OBC (from triangle OBC)? Wait, no. Let me think. If OC is perpendicular to AB, then line OC is perpendicular to AB, so line OC is the altitude from O to AB. Therefore, point C is on the extension of OM, where M is the midpoint of AB. 

Therefore, line BC connects point B to point C. So angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC. Now, in triangle OAB, angle at B is angle OBA, which is one of the base angles. And angle OBA is adjacent to angle ABC. Wait, maybe angle ABC is supplementary to angle OBA? Or is there a relation? 

Let me try to break down angle ABC. At point B, the lines BA and BC form angle ABC. Line BO is part of triangle OAB, so angle between BA and BO is angle OBA. Then, angle between BO and BC would be angle OBC. Therefore, angle ABC = angle OBA + angle OBC. 

Yes! Because angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC, while angle OBA is between BA and BO, and angle OBC is between BO and BC. Therefore, angle ABC = angle OBA + angle OBC. 

Earlier, in triangle OAB, angle OBA = x. In triangle OBC, angle OBC = y. So angle ABC = x + y = 25 degrees. 

Now, in triangle OAB, angles are x at B, x at A, and angle AOB = 180 - 2x. 

In triangle OBC, angles are y at B, y at C, and angle BOC = 180 - 2y. 

Additionally, since OC is perpendicular to AB, which implies that angle between OC and AB is 90 degrees. Since OC is the line from O to C, and AB is the chord, then the angle between OC and AB is 90 degrees. This might relate to some right triangles. 

Also, since OA, OB, and OC are radii, OA = OB = OC. 

Moreover, since OC is perpendicular to AB, and AB is a chord, then OM (midpoint of AB) lies on OC. Therefore, OM is the distance from O to AB, and since OC is a radius, OM + MC = OC? Or is it OM = OC? Wait, if OC is the line from O to C, which is a radius, and M is the midpoint of AB, then M lies on OC. Therefore, OM is a part of OC. So, the length from O to M is OM, and from M to C is MC. Therefore, OC = OM + MC. 

But since OC is a radius, and OM is the distance from the center to the chord AB, which can be expressed as OM = √(r² - (AB/2)²). But I don't know AB's length. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to relate angles. Since angle between OC and AB is 90 degrees, and OC is a radius. 

Wait, let me think about triangle OMB. Since OM is perpendicular to AB, triangle OMB is a right triangle with right angle at M. So, OM is the height, MB is half of AB, and OB is the hypotenuse (radius). Therefore, OM² + MB² = OB². 

But I don't know the lengths here, but maybe angles. 

Alternatively, since OC is perpendicular to AB, and OC is a radius, maybe we can find some relationships between angles. 

Let me go back to the previous equations. From before, angle ABC = x + y = 25 degrees. 

In triangle OAB, angle AOB = 180 - 2x. 

In triangle OBC, angle BOC = 180 - 2y. 

But angle BOC is the central angle over arc BC. Similarly, angle AOB is the central angle over arc AB. 

But how do these relate to each other? 

Also, since OC is perpendicular to AB, the arc AB can be related to the position of C. 

Wait, earlier I considered that angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC, giving arc AC = 50 degrees. Therefore, central angle AOC = 50 degrees. 

So angle AOC = 50 degrees. 

But angle AOC is also made up of angles AOM and MOC. Wait, since M is the midpoint of AB, and OC passes through M. Therefore, angle AOC is composed of angle AOM and angle MOC. But since OC is perpendicular to AB, angle between OC and AB is 90 degrees. 

Hmm, maybe I need to connect this with the previous variables. 

Alternatively, since arc AC is 50 degrees, then the central angle AOC is 50 degrees. Therefore, angle AOC = 50 degrees. 

But angle AOC is the angle between OA and OC. 

In triangle AOC, OA = OC (both radii), so it's an isosceles triangle. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. Let me call them z. So, angle OAC = angle OCA = z. Then, angle AOC = 180 - 2z = 50 degrees. Therefore, 2z = 130 degrees, so z = 65 degrees. 

So angle OAC = 65 degrees. 

But angle OAC is part of triangle OAB. Let me see. 

At point A, angle OAB is x (from earlier). Is angle OAC related to x? 

Since OA is a radius, and OC is a radius, and AB is a chord. Let me think about the angles at point A. 

In triangle OAB, angle at A is x, which is angle OAB. Also, angle OAC is 65 degrees. Are these angles related? 

Well, if I consider line AC, which connects A to C. Since C is on the circle, and AB is a chord, then AC is another chord. 

Wait, angle OAC is part of triangle OAC, which we found to be 65 degrees. But angle OAB is part of triangle OAB. 

Maybe there's a relationship between angle OAB and angle OAC. 

Let me think about the straight line from A to O to C. Wait, no. O is the center, A is a point on the circle, and C is another point on the circle. So, OA and OC are radii, making angle AOC = 50 degrees. 

But angle OAB is part of triangle OAB. Let me try to express angle OAB. 

In triangle OAB, angles at A and B are equal (since OA = OB). So angle OAB = angle OBA = x. 

Also, angle OAB is adjacent to angle OAC. Wait, if I consider line AC, which connects A to C. Then, angle between OA and AC is angle OAC = 65 degrees. But angle OAB is part of triangle OAB, which is adjacent to AB. So, maybe angle between OA and AB is angle OAB = x. 

Wait, OA is a radius, AB is a chord. So, angle between OA and AB is angle OAB, which is x. And angle between OA and AC is angle OAC = 65 degrees. Therefore, the angle between AB and AC is angle OAC - angle OAB = 65 - x. 

But angle between AB and AC is angle CAB. Wait, angle CAB is part of triangle ABC. 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle ABC. 

In triangle ABC, we have angle at B is 25 degrees, angle at A is ... ?

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to summarize what I have so far:

From angle ABC being 25 degrees, and angle ABC = x + y = 25 degrees, where x is angle OBA and y is angle OBC. 

In triangle OAB, angle AOB = 180 - 2x. 

In triangle OBC, angle BOC = 180 - 2y. 

Also, from earlier, angle AOC = 50 degrees. 

But angle AOC is the angle between OA and OC. How does that relate to other angles? 

Since OA and OC are radii, angle AOC is the central angle between points A and C, which we said was 50 degrees. 

But angle AOC can also be expressed as angle AOB + angle BOC? Or is there another relation? 

Wait, points A, B, and C are on the circle. If I consider the order of the points, depending on where C is. If OC is perpendicular to AB, then C is positioned such that OC is the perpendicular bisector of AB. So, assuming AB is horizontal, C is vertically above the midpoint of AB. 

Therefore, moving from A to B to C, the arcs would be different. 

But maybe angle AOC is related to angle AOB and angle BOC. For example, if points A, B, and C are arranged such that angle AOC spans from A to C, passing through B or not. 

Alternatively, if I consider the full circle, the sum of arcs AB, BC, CD, etc., equals 360 degrees. But I don't have enough info about other arcs. 

Wait, earlier I thought that angle ABC subtends arc AC, making arc AC = 50 degrees. Therefore, the central angle AOC is 50 degrees. 

But angle AOC is also equal to angle AOB + angle BOC if points A, B, and C are arranged in that order around the circle. 

Wait, if arc AC is 50 degrees, and angle AOC is 50 degrees, then depending on the placement of B, angle AOB and BOC could add up to 50 degrees or not. 

Alternatively, maybe angle AOC is split into angle AOB and angle BOC. 

Suppose that arc AC is 50 degrees. If B is on the circle such that arc AB is some measure, and arc BC is another, then the total arc AB + arc BC = arc AC. But that depends on the direction. 

Alternatively, if points A and C are separated by arc AC of 50 degrees, then depending on where B is, the arcs could vary. 

This seems complicated. Let me try another approach. 

We had earlier that angle ABC = x + y = 25 degrees, where x = angle OBA and y = angle OBC. 

Also, in triangle OAB, angle AOB = 180 - 2x. 

In triangle OBC, angle BOC = 180 - 2y. 

Also, since OC is perpendicular to AB, and O is the center, then the line OC is the perpendicular bisector of AB. Thus, AB is perpendicular to OC, so the angle between AB and OC is 90 degrees. 

But AB is a chord, and OC is a radius. So, the angle between AB and OC is 90 degrees. This suggests that triangle OMB (where M is the midpoint of AB) is a right triangle, as mentioned earlier. 

But how to relate this to angles x and y? 

Wait, angle between AB and OC is 90 degrees. At point B, the line AB forms an angle with OC. But OC is the line from O to C. 

Alternatively, since OC is perpendicular to AB, then the slope of OC is perpendicular to AB. 

But maybe this isn't helpful without coordinates. 

Wait, let me think about triangle OBC. In triangle OBC, OB and OC are radii, so it's isosceles with OB = OC. Therefore, angles at B and C are equal: angle OBC = angle OCB = y. 

So angle at O is angle BOC = 180 - 2y. 

Similarly, in triangle OAB, angles at A and B are equal: x. 

Now, since OC is perpendicular to AB, and AB is a chord, then the line OC passes through the midpoint M of AB. Therefore, OM is perpendicular to AB. 

Thus, in triangle OMB, right-angled at M, with OM being the height. 

But how to relate this to angles x and y? 

Alternatively, since angle between OC and AB is 90 degrees, and AB is a chord, then the angle between OC and AB is 90 degrees. So, at point B, the line AB has a certain slope, and OC has a slope perpendicular to it. 

But I'm stuck here. Maybe I should use the fact that angle ABC is 25 degrees and relate it to the arcs. 

Earlier, I thought angle ABC subtends arc AC, so arc AC = 50 degrees. Then, central angle AOC = 50 degrees. 

Now, angle AOC is 50 degrees, and in triangle AOC, which is isosceles with OA = OC, so angles at A and C are equal. As before, each of those angles is 65 degrees. 

So angle OAC = 65 degrees. 

But angle OAC is the angle between OA and AC. 

Meanwhile, angle OAB is x, which is the angle between OA and AB. 

So, the angle between AB and AC is angle OAC - angle OAB = 65 - x. 

But angle between AB and AC is angle CAB in triangle ABC. 

So in triangle ABC, we have angle at A is angle CAB = 65 - x, angle at B is 25 degrees, and angle at C is ?. 

Sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees, so:

angle CAB + angle ABC + angle BCA = 180  
=> (65 - x) + 25 + angle BCA = 180  
=> 90 - x + angle BCA = 180  
=> angle BCA = 90 + x  

But angle BCA is also an angle in triangle ABC. 

Alternatively, since point C is on the circle, angle BCA is an inscribed angle. What does it subtend? 

Angle at C, angle BCA, subtends arc BA. So, measure of angle BCA is half the measure of arc BA. 

So, angle BCA = (arc BA)/2. 

But arc BA is equal to the central angle BOA, which is angle AOB = 180 - 2x. 

Therefore, angle BCA = (arc BA)/2 = (angle AOB)/2 = (180 - 2x)/2 = 90 - x. 

Which matches the previous equation: angle BCA = 90 + x? Wait, no. Wait, earlier calculation gave angle BCA = 90 + x, but according to the arc, it should be 90 - x. There's a contradiction here, which suggests an error in my reasoning. 

Wait, let me re-examine. 

I said angle BCA = 90 + x. But from the arc, angle BCA = (arc BA)/2 = (central angle AOB)/2 = (angle AOB)/2 = (180 - 2x)/2 = 90 - x. 

So equating the two expressions for angle BCA: 

From triangle ABC: angle BCA = 90 + x  
From arc: angle BCA = 90 - x  
So, 90 + x = 90 - x → x = 0, which is impossible. 

This indicates a mistake in my reasoning. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! When I said angle between AB and AC is 65 - x, that might be incorrect. 

Let me re-express: angle OAC is 65 degrees, which is the angle between OA and AC. Angle OAB is x, which is the angle between OA and AB. 

But AB and AC are two different lines from point A. So, the angle between AB and AC is |angle OAC - angle OAB|, depending on their relative directions. 

But if angle OAC is measured from OA to AC, and angle OAB is measured from OA to AB, then the angle between AB and AC is angle OAC - angle OAB if they are on the same side. 

But I assumed it was 65 - x, but maybe it's x - 65 or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe angle between AB and AC is angle OAC + angle OAB, depending on their directions. 

This requires careful consideration of the diagram. 

Assume that AB is horizontal, with A on the left and B on the right. OC is vertical upward, perpendicular to AB. Point C is above AB. 

At point A, OA is a radius pointing from O to A. Since AB is horizontal, and O is somewhere along the vertical line OC. 

So, OA is from O to A, which is to the left of O. The angle between OA and AB is angle OAB = x. 

The angle between OA and AC is angle OAC = 65 degrees. 

Depending on the direction of AC, this angle could be measured clockwise or counterclockwise. 

If OA is pointing to the left, and AB is horizontal to the right, then AC is going from A upwards to C. So, the angle between OA and AC would be angle between OA (left) and AC (upward). 

This angle would be greater than 90 degrees if AC is going upward from A. But earlier calculation said angle OAC is 65 degrees, which is acute. This suggests inconsistency. 

Perhaps my assumption that angle OAC is 65 degrees is wrong. Let me check that. 

Earlier, I said that since arc AC is 50 degrees, central angle AOC is 50 degrees. Then, in triangle AOC, which is isosceles with OA = OC, the base angles are (180 - 50)/2 = 65 degrees. So angle OAC = 65 degrees. 

But if OA is pointing to the left, and OC is pointing upward, then angle between OA and OC is 50 degrees. But how does that affect angle OAC?

Wait, angle OAC is the angle at point A between OA and AC. So, if OA is from A to O, and AC is from A to C. 

Let me think about triangle AOC. In triangle AOC, angle at A is angle OAC, angle at C is angle OCA, and angle at O is 50 degrees. 

So, if I can find angle OAC, I need to consider the triangle. 

But without knowing other angles or sides, it's hard. However, since OA = OC, it's isosceles, so angles at A and C are equal. So, angle OAC = angle OCA = (180 - 50)/2 = 65 degrees. 

But if OA is pointing from A to O, and AC is pointing from A to C, then angle OAC is 65 degrees. 

But if AB is horizontal, and OA is from A to O, then angle between OA and AB is x. 

So, the angle between OA and AB is x, and the angle between OA and AC is 65 degrees. 

Therefore, the angle between AB and AC would be the difference between these two angles. Depending on their direction, it could be 65 - x or x - 65. 

But since angle ABC is 25 degrees, and that's the angle between AB and BC, which is different. 

Maybe I should abandon this approach and try to relate angle ABC = x + y = 25, and find another equation involving x and y. 

Earlier, I tried relating angle BCA to x and got conflicting results, suggesting a mistake. Let me try again. 

In triangle ABC, angle at B is 25 degrees. Angles at A and C are angle CAB and angle BCA. 

Using the Law of Sines on triangle ABC: 

AB / sin(angle BCA) = BC / sin(angle CAB) = AC / sin(25°)

But I don't know the lengths. 

Alternatively, since points A, B, C are on the circle, maybe using the Law of Sines for the circle. 

But I need to relate angles to arcs. 

Earlier, I said angle ABC = 25 degrees subtends arc AC, so arc AC = 50 degrees. 

Then, arc AC = 50 degrees. 

What about arc AB? Let me think. 

Since OC is perpendicular to AB, and O is the center, then AB is a chord whose midpoint is on OC. 

The arc AB can be determined if we know the central angle AOB. 

Let me denote angle AOB as θ. Then, arc AB is θ degrees. 

Arc AC is 50 degrees. 

Now, the total circle is 360 degrees. So, arc AB + arc BC + arc CA = 360? No, because it depends on the arrangement of points. 

Alternatively, if I consider the arcs between A, B, and C. 

Assuming the points are arranged in the order A, B, C around the circle. Or another order. 

But since OC is perpendicular to AB, and C is on the circle, the position of C depends on the location of AB. 

But let's assume that arc AC is 50 degrees, and arc AB is θ degrees. Then, arc BC would depend on the rest. 

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's difficult. 

Alternatively, since OC is perpendicular to AB, and O is the center, then the arc AB is related to the position of C. 

Since OC is perpendicular to AB, and C is on the circle, then the arc AC is 50 degrees, and arc CB is something. 

But I need another relationship. 

Let me return to angle ABC = 25 degrees = x + y, where x = angle OBA and y = angle OBC. 

In triangle OAB, angle AOB = 180 - 2x. 

In triangle OBC, angle BOC = 180 - 2y. 

Also, since OC is perpendicular to AB, and O is the center, then angle between OC and AB is 90 degrees. 

This might relate to the angles at O. 

Consider triangle OMB, right-angled at M. Since OM is the distance from O to AB, and MB is half of AB. 

But how does this relate to angles x and y? 

Alternatively, consider that in triangle OMB, OM is perpendicular to AB. Since OC is along OM extended to C, then OC is perpendicular to AB. 

But OC is a radius, so OC = r, and OM = r cos(theta), where theta is the angle between OC and the radius OA? Not sure. 

Wait, let me think in terms of coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to simplify. 

Let me place point O at (0, 0). Let me assume AB is horizontal. Let me set AB such that M, the midpoint of AB, is on the y-axis. Since OC is perpendicular to AB and passes through M, OC is vertical. So, OC is along the y-axis. 

Let me define coordinates: 

Let me let AB be horizontal, with midpoint M at (0, 0). Wait, but O is the center. If OC is along the y-axis, and M is the midpoint of AB, then O is somewhere along the y-axis. 

Wait, if OC is the line from O to C, and it's perpendicular to AB, then O is on the line OC, which is the y-axis. So, O is at (0, k) for some k. 

But since OC is a radius, and C is on the circle. Let me assume the circle has center at O(0, k), and radius r. 

Point M is the midpoint of AB, which is on the y-axis. Let me say AB has length 2a, so that AM = MB = a. Since AB is horizontal, points A and B are at (-a, m) and (a, m) for some m. But since M is on the y-axis, and AB is horizontal, then M is at (0, m). Wait, but O is on the y-axis. 

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Let me choose specific coordinates. 

Let me set O at (0, 0). Let me let AB be horizontal, with midpoint M at (0, b), so that OC is vertical, passing through M. Since OC is perpendicular to AB, and O is at (0, 0), then OC is the line from O(0,0) through M(0, b) to point C. 

So, point C is along the line OM extended. Since OC is a radius, the distance from O to C is r. 

But O is at (0,0), and M is at (0, b). So, the line OM is the y-axis. Point C is on this line, so its coordinates are (0, c), where c is some value. 

Since OC is a radius, the distance from O to C is |c| = r. So, c = ±r. 

But since OC is perpendicular to AB, and AB is horizontal, then C is either above or below AB. Let's assume it's above, so c > 0. 

So, point C is at (0, r). 

Now, points A and B are on the circle. Since AB is a horizontal chord with midpoint at M(0, b), and O is at (0, 0). 

The distance from O to M is |b|. The length of AB is 2a, so that AM = a. 

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OMA: 

OA^2 = OM^2 + AM^2  
r^2 = b^2 + a^2  
So, a^2 = r^2 - b^2. 

Now, points A and B are at (-a, b) and (a, b), since AB is horizontal at y = b. 

Now, point C is at (0, r). 

Now, we need to find angle ABC = 25 degrees. Let's compute coordinates of points A, B, C:

A(-a, b), B(a, b), C(0, r).

Compute angle ABC. 

To compute angle at B between points A, B, C. 

Vector BA = A - B = (-a - a, b - b) = (-2a, 0)  
Vector BC = C - B = (0 - a, r - b) = (-a, r - b)  

The angle between vectors BA and BC is angle ABC. 

Using the dot product formula: 

cos(theta) = (BA · BC) / (|BA| |BC|)  

Compute BA · BC = (-2a)(-a) + (0)(r - b) = 2a² + 0 = 2a²  

|BA| = sqrt((-2a)^2 + 0^2) = 2a  

|BC| = sqrt((-a)^2 + (r - b)^2) = sqrt(a² + (r - b)^2)  

Thus, cos(theta) = 2a² / (2a * sqrt(a² + (r - b)^2)) ) = a / sqrt(a² + (r - b)^2)  

Given that angle ABC is 25 degrees, so:

cos(25°) = a / sqrt(a² + (r - b)^2)  

Square both sides:

cos²(25°) = a² / (a² + (r - b)^2)  

Cross-multiplying:

cos²(25°) [a² + (r - b)^2] = a²  
cos²(25°) a² + cos²(25°) (r - b)^2 = a²  
Bring terms with a² to one side:

cos²(25°) (r - b)^2 = a² (1 - cos²(25°))  
cos²(25°) (r - b)^2 = a² sin²(25°)  
Take square root:

cos(25°) (r - b) = ±a sin(25°)  
Assuming r > b (since C is above AB), then r - b is positive. So:

cos(25°) (r - b) = a sin(25°)  
Divide both sides by cos(25°):

r - b = a tan(25°)  
Thus, a = (r - b) / tan(25°)  

Now, recall from earlier that a² = r² - b². 

Substitute a = (r - b)/tan(25°) into this equation:

[(r - b)/tan(25°)]² = r² - b²  
Expand left side:

(r - b)^2 / tan²(25°) = r² - b²  
Multiply both sides by tan²(25°):

(r - b)^2 = (r² - b²) tan²(25°)  
Note that r² - b² = (r - b)(r + b), so:

(r - b)^2 = (r - b)(r + b) tan²(25°)  
Assuming r ≠ b (which it isn't, since C is not coinciding with M), divide both sides by (r - b):

r - b = (r + b) tan²(25°)  
Rearrange:

r - b = r tan²(25°) + b tan²(25°)  
Bring terms with r to left, terms with b to right:

r - r tan²(25°) = b + b tan²(25°)  
Factor:

r [1 - tan²(25°)] = b [1 + tan²(25°)]  
Thus,

r/b = [1 + tan²(25°)] / [1 - tan²(25°)]  

Recall that 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, so:

r/b = sec²(25°) / (1 - tan²(25°))  

But 1 - tan²θ = (cos²θ - sin²θ)/cos²θ = cos(2θ)/cos²θ. 

Wait, alternatively, let me compute numerical values. 

Let me calculate tan(25°): approximately 0.4663. 

So tan²(25°) ≈ 0.4663² ≈ 0.2174. 

Then, numerator: 1 + 0.2174 = 1.2174  
Denominator: 1 - 0.2174 = 0.7826  
Thus, r/b ≈ 1.2174 / 0.7826 ≈ 1.556. 

But this gives r/b ≈ 1.556, so b = r / 1.556 ≈ 0.643r. 

But how does this help us? 

Our goal is to find angle AOB, which is the central angle between points A and B. 

Points A and B are at (-a, b) and (a, b). The angle AOB is the angle between vectors OA and OB. 

Since O is at (0, 0), vector OA is from O to A: (-a, b), and vector OB is from O to B: (a, b). 

The angle between vectors OA and OB is angle AOB. 

Using the dot product: 

cos(angle AOB) = (OA · OB) / (|OA| |OB|)  

OA · OB = (-a)(a) + (b)(b) = -a² + b²  
|OA| = |OB| = r  
Thus,

cos(angle AOB) = (-a² + b²) / r²  

But from earlier, a² = r² - b². Substituting:

cos(angle AOB) = -(r² - b²) + b² / r² = (-r² + b² + b²) / r² = (-r² + 2b²) / r² = -1 + 2(b²/r²)  

But from earlier, we found that r/b ≈ 1.556, so b = r / 1.556. Thus, b²/r² = 1/(1.556²) ≈ 1/2.421 ≈ 0.413. 

Thus, cos(angle AOB) ≈ -1 + 2*0.413 = -1 + 0.826 = -0.174. 

So angle AOB ≈ arccos(-0.174) ≈ 100 degrees. 

Because cos(100°) is approximately cos(90+10) = -sin(10) ≈ -0.1736. 

So angle AOB is approximately 100 degrees. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 100°. 

Thus, the answer is C.
