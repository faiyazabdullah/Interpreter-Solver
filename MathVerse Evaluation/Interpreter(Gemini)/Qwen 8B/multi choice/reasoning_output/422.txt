QUESTION:
The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?

CHOICES:
No choices found.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the remaining area when the total area is 6096. But wait, the problem mentions three rectangles with given areas. Let me start by understanding the given data.

First, there are three rectangles labeled 1, 2, and 3. Each has a height and width specified. The heights of all three are 6 units. For rectangle 1, the width is 1000, so its area should be width times height, which is 1000*6 = 6000. That matches the given AreaOf(1) equals 6000. Then rectangle 2 has a width of 10, same height of 6, so area is 10*6=60, which aligns with AreaOf(2)=60. 

Now, the third rectangle, rectangle 3, has a height of 6 as well. Its width isn't directly given, but we know the formula for area is width multiplied by height. However, the problem states that the sum of the areas of all three rectangles is 6096. Wait, the user added AreaOf(1) + AreaOf(2) + AreaOf(3) equals 6096. Since we already have AreaOf(1) as 6000 and AreaOf(2) as 60, adding those gives 6060. Therefore, the area of rectangle 3 would be 6096 - 6060 = 36. 

But hold on, the problem says "How much area is remaining?" Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Are they referring to something else? Like, if these rectangles are part of a larger figure, and the total area is 6096, then the remaining area would be the total minus the sum of these three. But according to the given data, the sum of the three areas is exactly 6096. So if the total area is 6096, then the remaining area would be zero? That seems odd. Or maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem says "the total area is 6096". How much area is remaining? Perhaps the total area refers to some other context where these rectangles are parts of, and the remaining area is the rest. But based on the given data, the sum of the three rectangles' areas is 6096. Unless there's more to it. Let me re-examine the predicates.

Looking back at the predicates, there's also AreaOf(3). The problem includes Equals(Mul(WidthOf(3), HeightOf(3)), AreaOf(3)). Since the height of rectangle 3 is 6, and width is unknown. But since the total area is given as 6096, which is the sum of all three areas, and two of them are known, then AreaOf(3) is 6096 - 6000 - 60 = 36. Therefore, the area of rectangle 3 is 36. But how does that relate to the remaining area? 

Wait, perhaps the question is trying to trick us. If the total area is 6096, and the sum of the three rectangles is exactly that, then there's no remaining area. But the way the question is phrased, "how much area is remaining," suggests that there's a bigger shape or figure, and these three rectangles are parts of it. But without more information about the total area of the bigger figure, we can't compute the remaining area. However, the problem statement says "the total area is 6096." Maybe the total area refers to the combined area of the three rectangles? In that case, the remaining area would be zero. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is misworded, and the actual total area is different. 

Wait, looking at the predicates again, there's a line that says Add(AreaOf(1), AreaOf(2), AreaOf(3)) equals 6096. So that means the sum of the three areas is 6096. So if the total area is 6096, then the remaining area would be zero. But that seems too straightforward. However, the answer choices say "No choices found." Which suggests that maybe the original problem had options, but in this case, the user hasn't provided them. But according to the instructions, the answer choices are listed as No choices found. So the answer is likely zero. But the user's instruction says to choose among the answer choices. However, since there are no choices provided, the answer might be zero. But according to the problem setup, the sum is exactly 6096, so the remaining area is zero. Hence, the answer is zero. But since the answer choices aren't present, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but the system says "No choices found." Wait, the user included "Answer Choices: No choices found." So the answer is probably zero, but since there are no options, maybe the intended answer is 36? Wait, no. Because the problem asks for the remaining area, assuming that the total area is 6096. If the total area is 6096, and the sum of the three areas is 6096, then the remaining area is zero. So the answer should be zero. But since there are no answer choices, maybe the user made a mistake. However, the problem may have been presented incorrectly. 

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the AreaOf(3). We know that the area of rectangle 3 is 36, because 6096 - 6000 - 60 = 36. So if someone asked for the area of rectangle 3, the answer would be 36. But the question is about the remaining area. If the total area was supposed to be more than 6096, but the problem says the total is 6096, then the remaining area is zero. But the problem's wording is confusing. Without more context, the only logical conclusion is that the remaining area is zero. Hence, the answer is zero. But since there are no answer choices, maybe the answer is not available. However, the user's instruction says to select the correct answer choice. Given that the answer is zero, but there are no options, the system might expect another approach. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the total area is 6096, and the user is being asked for the remaining area after accounting for the three rectangles. But if the total area is exactly the sum of the three, then the remaining area is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. But since the answer choices are not provided, maybe the answer is 36? No, that's the area of the third rectangle. Wait, the question is ambiguous. However, based on the given data, the total area is the sum of the three rectangles, so the remaining area is zero. Thus, the answer is zero. But since the answer choices are not given, the correct answer would be zero. But since the user said "No choices found", maybe the answer is not among the options. However, the user's instruction requires selecting from the answer choices. This is confusing. But according to the problem's structure, the answer must be zero. So I'll proceed with that.
