QUESTION:
Consider the graph shown. A curve passes (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), (3,8). As x increases, y increases.


Which of the following relationships could be represented by the given graph?

CHOICES:
A:The number of handshakes, y, made by x people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.
B:The number of layers, y, resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half x times.
C:The number of people, y, attending a parent/teacher conference when there are x parents who each bring 2 children.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about determining which relationship is represented by a graph that passes through the points (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), (3,8) where y increases as x increases. The options are A, B, or C.

First, I need to understand the pattern of these points. Let me list them out again: when x is 0, y is 1; x=1, y=2; x=2, y=4; x=3, y=8. Wait a second, looking at these coordinates, it seems like y is doubling each time x increases by 1. Starting from (0,1), then (1,2) is double, (2,4) is double again, (3,8) doubles once more. So, the relationship here looks exponential. Specifically, y = 2^x. Because when x=0, 2^0 is 1, which matches. Then x=1, 2^1=2, yes. x=2 gives 4, and x=3 gives 8. That fits perfectly.

Now, let's look at the answer choices. Option A says the number of handshakes if every person shakes hands with every other person. Wait, the formula for handshakes is combination of n people taken 2 at a time, so n(n-1)/2. That's a quadratic relationship, not exponential. For example, if there are 3 people, handshakes would be 3, but according to the points, when x=3, y=8. So that doesn't fit. So A probably isn't the right answer.

Option B is the number of layers from folding a paper in half x times. Hmm, when you fold a paper in half once, you get 2 layers. Fold it again, 4 layers, then 8, then 16, etc. Each fold doubles the previous number of layers. So the formula here is 2^x. But wait, when x=0, folding zero times would mean 1 layer. So starting from x=0, layers would be 1, then 2, 4, 8... So that matches exactly the points given. So B seems to fit here.

Option C is the number of people attending a parent/teacher conference when there are x parents each bringing 2 children. So if there are x parents, each brings 2 kids, so total people would be x parents + 2x children = 3x. So the equation would be y = 3x. That's linear. For example, x=1, y=3; x=2, y=6; but our points have y increasing exponentially. So C is linear, not matching the exponential growth here. Therefore, C is not correct.

So based on the pattern of the points, the correct answer should be B because it follows y = 2^x, which matches the given coordinates. Let me just verify again. When x=0, layers are 1 (since no folds), x=1, 2 layers, x=2, 4, x=3, 8. Exactly the points given. So B is the right choice. 

Therefore, the answer is B.
