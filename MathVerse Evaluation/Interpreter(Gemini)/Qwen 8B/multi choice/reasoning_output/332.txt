Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have points P, M, and S. It says that S is the south cardinal point. The angle at M, specifically angle PMS, is 50 degrees. We need to find the true bearing of P from M. 

First, I should recall what a true bearing means. True bearing is measured clockwise from north. But since S is the south cardinal point, maybe we need to consider directions relative to that. Wait, but bearings are typically referenced from north. Hmm. Let me think.

Let me visualize the setup. Point M is connected to both P and S via lines. So, line MP and MS form two sides of angle PMS, which is 50 degrees. Since S is the south cardinal point, that means the line MS is pointing directly south from M. So if I imagine standing at point M, facing south towards S, then the direction to P would make a 50-degree angle with that south line.

But wait, bearings are usually measured from north. So if the angle between MP and MS is 50 degrees, and MS is south, how does that translate to a bearing? Let me sketch mentally. Suppose we're at point M. South is directly downward. If we turn 50 degrees towards the east or west from south to face point P. Depending on the direction of the angle, the bearing could vary.

Wait, the angle PMS is at point M, so the angle between PM and SM. Since SM is pointing south, then PM is making a 50-degree angle with SM. So if SM is south, then PM is either 50 degrees east of south or west of south. But bearings are measured clockwise from north. So to convert this angle into a bearing, we need to figure out the direction from M to P.

Let me break it down. Let's assume standard compass directions. North is 0°, East is 90°, South is 180°, West is 270°. So if the line from M to S is directly south, that's 180° bearing. Now, the angle between SM (south) and PM is 50 degrees. So depending on which side the angle opens, the direction of P would be either 50 degrees east of south or west of south.

But bearings are measured clockwise from north. So if we are at M, facing south (bearing 180°), turning 50 degrees towards east (clockwise) would mean the bearing from M to P is 180° - 50° = 130°? Wait, no. Wait, when you turn east from south, that's towards the right (if facing south). So if you start facing south (180°), turning east (right) by 50 degrees would add 50 degrees to the bearing. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the bearing by considering the angle relative to north. Let me try another approach. Imagine the line MS is pointing directly south. So from point M, the direction to S is 180° bearing. The angle between SM and PM is 50 degrees. So the line PM forms a 50-degree angle with the south direction. Therefore, the direction of PM would be 50 degrees east of due south or west of due south. 

To find the bearing from M to P, we need to express this direction as a bearing. If the angle is measured towards the east from south, then the bearing would be 180° minus 50°, because starting from north, going clockwise. Wait, let's see:

South is 180°. If you go 50 degrees east of south, that would be 180° - 50° = 130°? No, that doesn't seem right. Because moving east from south would increase the bearing. Wait, no. Bearings are measured clockwise from north. So if you're facing south (180°), then turning east (which is clockwise from north) would decrease the bearing. Wait, no. Let me think about the compass:

Imagine a clock face. North is up, clockwise. So:

- 0° (or 360°): North
- 90°: East
- 180°: South
- 270°: West

So if you're facing south (180°), and you turn east (towards the right, clockwise), you're heading towards the east. Wait, no. Facing south, turning east would mean turning left (counter-clockwise) to face east? Wait, no. If you are facing south, your left is east? Wait, no. If you face south, your left side is east? Wait, no. When facing south, your left is east. Wait, let's think. If you face north, left is west, right is east. If you turn around (face south), left is east, right is west. So, if you are facing south (180°), turning east would be to your left (counter-clockwise). But bearings are measured clockwise from north. So if the direction is east of south, that would correspond to a bearing of 180° - 50° = 130°? Or 180° + 50°?

Wait, here's a better way. Let me use coordinate axes. Let’s place point M at the origin. Let’s say the positive y-axis is north, negative y-axis is south. Positive x-axis is east, negative x-axis is west. Then, the line MS goes from M to S, which is directly south, so along the negative y-axis. The angle PMS is 50 degrees. So the line MP makes a 50-degree angle with the line MS (which is along negative y-axis). 

Assuming the angle is measured in the standard counterclockwise direction (but angles in geometry are often considered as the smallest angle unless specified otherwise). However, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(P,M,S)) is 50°, so the angle at M between PM and SM is 50 degrees. 

So, if SM is pointing south (negative y-axis), then PM is forming a 50-degree angle with SM. Depending on the orientation, PM could be either to the east or west of SM. But without more info, maybe we need to assume the standard position. Typically, in such problems, unless stated otherwise, angles are measured in the counter-clockwise direction. Wait, but in terms of the angle at M, between PM and SM. Let me think of the angle between PM and SM. So, if SM is pointing south (from M to S), and PM is some other direction. So the angle between PM and SM is 50 degrees. 

So if SM is pointing south (downward), then PM could be going to the east or west. Let's suppose it's going east. So from point M, looking towards S (south), then turning 50 degrees towards east (to the left, assuming standard orientation). Wait, but in terms of coordinates, if SM is along negative y-axis, then turning east from SM would be towards positive x-direction. So the direction of PM would be southeast, making a 50-degree angle with south. 

Now, the bearing from M to P would be measured clockwise from north. So if the direction is southeast, but how much? Let me calculate. 

If the direction is 50 degrees east of south, then the bearing would be 180° (south) minus 50°, which is 130°? Wait, no. Wait, bearings are measured clockwise from north. So if you are facing east of south, that would be 180° - 50° = 130°? Wait, no. Let me think again. 

Suppose I'm at point M. The line to S is directly south (bearing 180°). The line to P is 50 degrees to the east of south. To find the bearing of P from M, I need to measure clockwise from north. Starting from north (0°), going clockwise to the direction of P. 

If P is 50 degrees east of south, then from north, how many degrees do I turn? Well, from north to east is 90°, then from east to south is another 90°, totaling 180°. So if P is 50° east of south, that's 180° - 50° = 130° from north? Wait, no. Wait, if you're facing east (90°), then turning south would be another 90°, so 90° + 90° = 180°. If P is 50° east of south, then from north, you'd go 90° to east, then subtract 50°, giving 90° - 50° = 40°? That doesn’t make sense. 

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's draw a diagram mentally. 

Starting from north (0°), rotating clockwise. 

- 0°: North
- 90°: East
- 180°: South
- 270°: West

If the direction is 50° east of south, that is, starting from south (180°), moving 50° towards east. Since east is clockwise from north, moving 50° east from south would be 180° - 50° = 130°? Wait, no. Because from south, moving east (clockwise) would be decreasing the bearing. For example, south is 180°, moving east (clockwise) would take us towards west? Wait, no. Wait, if you are at south (180°), and you move east, which is clockwise from north. Wait, confusion arises here. Maybe using vector components.

Let me assign coordinates. Let's set M at the origin (0,0). South direction is along the negative y-axis. So point S is somewhere along the negative y-axis. The direction from M to P makes a 50-degree angle with the direction from M to S (which is negative y-axis). Assuming the angle is measured in the plane, so the direction of PM could be in two possible directions: one to the east of south and one to the west of south. 

If we assume the angle is measured towards the east (as is common in such problems unless specified otherwise), then the direction of PM is 50 degrees east of south. To find the bearing from M to P, we need to find the angle clockwise from north to the line MP.

Since south is 180°, and the direction is 50° east of south, that is, 50° towards east from south. So from north, the bearing would be 180° - 50° = 130°? Wait, no. Let me think. If you are facing south (180°), and turn 50° towards east, that would be equivalent to facing a direction that is 50° less than south. But how does that translate to the bearing?

Alternatively, imagine a right triangle where the line MS is the vertical axis (south), and the line MP is at 50° from it. The bearing would be measured from north. Let's think of the angle between the north-south line and the line MP. 

If the angle between MP and MS (south) is 50°, then the angle between MP and the north-south line (north) would be 180° - 50° = 130°, but that depends on the direction. Wait, if you have a line making 50° with south, then the angle between that line and north would be 180° - 50° = 130°, but only if the line is in the southern hemisphere. 

Yes! So if the direction of P is 50° east of south, then the bearing from M to P is 180° - 50° = 130°. Because from north, you turn 130° clockwise to face that direction. Alternatively, if it were 50° west of south, the bearing would be 180° + 50° = 230°. But since the problem doesn't specify direction, but in typical cases, angles like this are assumed to be in the direction that makes the bearing acute or something. Wait, but the problem says "true bearing", which can be any value from 0° to 360°. 

However, the problem statement mentions that S is the south cardinal point. So, given that, and the angle PMS is 50°, we need to determine the bearing. Without knowing whether the angle is to the east or west of south, there could be ambiguity. But in many standardized problems, especially those involving compass directions, angles are typically measured in a specific direction unless stated otherwise. 

But wait, the problem gives us that angle PMS is 50°, which is a fixed value. So regardless of direction, the bearing would depend on the direction of the angle. However, since there are no options given (the user said "No choices found"), but the original instruction mentioned answer choices, but in the current prompt, it's unclear. Wait, the initial problem says "Answer Choices: No choices found." So maybe the user intended to provide options but forgot. But according to the problem, the user has to choose from A-D, but the actual answer choices aren't listed. This seems confusing. 

But proceeding under the assumption that the answer is 130°, which is 50° east of south. Hence, the bearing from M to P would be 130°. Alternatively, if it was west of south, it would be 230°. But since the problem doesn't specify, but in many contexts, angles are measured in the east direction unless stated otherwise. 

Therefore, the true bearing of P from M is 130°, which would be option... but since there are no options provided, the answer is likely 130°, which would correspond to option C if options were labeled A=100°, B=130°, C=180°, D=230°. But without knowing the options, I can't be sure. However, the user instructed to select the correct answer choice among A-D, implying that there are four options, but they weren't provided. Given that, but based on standard problems, the answer is likely 130°, which would be option B if B is 130°, or C if C is 130°. 

But since the user hasn't provided the options, and the original problem didn't list them, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, given the information, the bearing is 130°, so if that's an option, that's the answer. Otherwise, based on the absence of options, but per the instructions, the answer is Final Answer: B, assuming B represents 130°, but this is speculative. However, since the user might have intended this, I'll proceed with that.
