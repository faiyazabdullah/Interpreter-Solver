MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle OBC given that angle A is 50 degrees. Let me start by recalling the given predicates and what they mean.

First, there are points A, B, C, and O. There's a circle with center O, and points A, B, C lie on this circle. Also, lines AB, AC, BC, OB, and OC are mentioned. Additionally, it's stated that OA, OB, and OC are radii since they're mentioned as being part of the circle. Wait, actually, the predicates say IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B),Circle(O)) and similarly for Line(O,C). So, OB and OC are radii, which means OB equals OC because all radii of a circle are equal. Therefore, triangle OBC is isosceles with OB = OC. That tells us that angles at B and C are equal. 

Now, the given angle is angle BAC, which is 50 degrees. Angle BAC is an inscribed angle in the circle. Since points A, B, C are on the circle, angle BAC subtends arc BC. I remember that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its subtended arc. So, if angle BAC is 50 degrees, then the arc BC must be 100 degrees. 

But wait, angle at the center, which would be angle BOC, subtending the same arc BC, should be twice the inscribed angle. So angle BOC would be 100 degrees. But wait, triangle OBC has two sides as radii (OB and OC) so it's an isosceles triangle with base BC and vertex angle at O. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So, angles at B and C (which are angles OBC and OCB) should be equal. Let me calculate them. 

Since angle BOC is 100 degrees, the remaining angles at B and C add up to 80 degrees. Each of those angles is 40 degrees. So angle OBC is 40 degrees. Wait, but let me check again. 

Wait, angle BAC is 50 degrees, which is an inscribed angle over arc BC. Therefore, arc BC measures 100 degrees. Then the central angle BOC is equal to the measure of arc BC, which is 100 degrees. In triangle OBC, angles at B and C are equal because OB=OC. So, angle OBC = angle OCB = (180 - 100)/2 = 40 degrees. Therefore, angle OBC is 40 degrees. Looking at the options, that's option B. 

Let me verify once more. Another way: maybe considering other angles? For example, angle ABC or something else. Wait, but the problem gives angle BAC as 50 degrees, which we used correctly. So yes, the logic seems sound. Therefore, the answer should be B, 40 degrees.
