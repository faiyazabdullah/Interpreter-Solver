====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle with center O, and AC is the diameter. Also, AB equals AO. We need to find the measure of angle ABO. Let me start by recalling some theorems and properties that might help here.

First, since AC is the diameter of the circle, point O is the midpoint of AC. That means AO and OC are radii of the circle. Wait, but the problem says AB equals AO. Since AO is a radius, AB must also be equal to the radius. Hmm, so maybe there's something about triangle ABO being equilateral or isosceles?

Wait, the problem mentions that O is the center, so OA, OB, and OC are all radii. But AB equals AO, so AB is equal to the radius. Let me sketch this mentally. Points A and C are at the ends of the diameter, so angle ABC should be a right angle because any triangle inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle. Wait, but the problem states that angle ABC is a right angle? Let me check the given predicates. Oh yes, there's a predicate saying RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)). So angle ABC is 90 degrees. 

So triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at B. Now, since AC is the hypotenuse and it's the diameter, that fits with Thales' theorem. Now, AB equals AO. Since AO is the radius, let's denote the length of AO as r. Therefore, AB = r. But OA is a radius, so OA = OC = r. Then AC, being the diameter, is 2r. 

Now, looking at triangle ABO. We know OA = AB = r. So triangle ABO has two sides equal: OA and AB. Therefore, it's an isosceles triangle with OA = AB. Therefore, the base angles opposite those sides should be equal. Wait, but which angles are those? In triangle ABO, the sides OA and AB are equal. So the angles opposite them would be angle ABO and angle BOA? Wait, let me clarify.

Wait, triangle ABO has vertices A, B, O. The sides are AB, BO, and OA. Given that AB = OA, so sides AB and OA are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite these sides would be equal. The side AB is opposite angle AOB, and the side OA is opposite angle ABO. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle ABO:

- Side AB is opposite angle O.
- Side BO is opposite angle A.
- Side OA is opposite angle B.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me label the triangle properly. Let me think of triangle ABO where points A, B, O are connected. So vertex A connected to B and O; vertex B connected to A and O; vertex O connected to A and B.

So in triangle ABO, sides:

- AB: connects A to B
- BO: connects B to O
- OA: connects O to A

Given that AB = OA. So sides AB and OA are equal. Therefore, triangle ABO is isosceles with AB = OA. Therefore, the base angles are equal. Which angles? The angles opposite the equal sides. So, the side AB is opposite angle at O (angle AOB). The side OA is opposite angle at B (angle ABO). Therefore, if AB = OA, then angle AOB equals angle ABO. Wait, no—wait, in a triangle, the angles opposite equal sides are equal. So if AB = OA, then the angles opposite them are equal. The side AB is opposite angle O (since angle O is at vertex O, between sides BO and OA). The side OA is opposite angle B (at vertex B, between sides AB and BO). Therefore, angle at O (AOB) equals angle at B (ABO). So angle AOB = angle ABO.

But we need to find angle ABO. So if we can find angle AOB, then angle ABO is equal to that. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.

Alternatively, since AC is the diameter, and O is the center, so coordinates might help. Maybe assigning coordinates to make it easier. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let’s place the circle with center O at the origin (0,0). Let’s assume AC is horizontal, with A at (-r, 0) and C at (r, 0), making AC the diameter of length 2r. Then O is at (0,0). Now, point B lies somewhere on the circle, forming triangle ABC with a right angle at B. Since ABC is right-angled at B, and AC is the hypotenuse.

Also, AB = AO. Since AO is the distance from A to O, which is sqrt[(-r - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = r. Therefore, AB = r. So the length from A to B is r. Let's compute coordinates of B such that AB = r.

Coordinates of A: (-r, 0). Coordinates of B: (x,y) lying on the circle centered at O(0,0) with radius r. So x² + y² = r². The distance from A to B is sqrt[(x + r)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = sqrt[(x + r)^2 + y^2] = r. Squaring both sides: (x + r)^2 + y² = r² → x² + 2rx + r² + y² = r² → (x² + y²) + 2rx + r² = r² → since x² + y² = r², substitute: r² + 2rx + r² = r² → 2r² + 2rx = r² → 2rx = -r² → x = -r/2.

Therefore, the x-coordinate of B is -r/2. Then substituting back into x² + y² = r²: (-r/2)^2 + y² = r² → r²/4 + y² = r² → y² = 3r²/4 → y = ± (√3 r)/2. So coordinates of B are (-r/2, (√3 r)/2) or (-r/2, -(√3 r)/2). Assuming the diagram is drawn in standard position, let's take positive y-coordinate for simplicity. So B is at (-r/2, (√3 r)/2).

Now, we need to find the measure of angle ABO. Let's consider triangle ABO. Points A(-r, 0), B(-r/2, (√3 r)/2), O(0,0). Let's compute vectors or use coordinates to find the angle at B.

Wait, angle ABO is the angle at point B between points A, B, and O. So angle at B between BA and BO.

To find angle at B, we can use vector analysis. Compute vectors BA and BO, then find the angle between them.

Vector BA is A - B: (-r - (-r/2), 0 - (√3 r)/2) = (-r/2, -√3 r / 2)

Vector BO is O - B: (0 - (-r/2), 0 - (√3 r)/2) = (r/2, -√3 r / 2)

Then the angle between vectors BA and BO is angle ABO. To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (BA · BO) / (|BA| |BO|)

Compute BA · BO: (-r/2)(r/2) + (-√3 r / 2)(-√3 r / 2) = (-r²/4) + (3 r² / 4) = (2 r²)/4 = r²/2

|BA| is the magnitude of BA: sqrt[ (-r/2)^2 + (-√3 r / 2)^2 ] = sqrt[ r²/4 + 3 r²/4 ] = sqrt(r²) = r

Similarly, |BO| is the magnitude of BO: sqrt[ (r/2)^2 + (-√3 r / 2)^2 ] = same as |BA|, which is r.

Thus cos(theta) = (r²/2)/(r*r) = 1/2. Therefore theta = arccos(1/2) = 60 degrees. Wait, but that would mean angle ABO is 60 degrees. However, the options include D.60°, so that would be option D. But wait, let me verify again.

Wait, but according to our calculation, angle ABO is 60 degrees. But let me cross-check with another method. Since triangle ABO has AB=OA=r, and OA is from O(0,0) to A(-r,0), which is length r. AB is from A(-r,0) to B(-r/2, √3 r/2), which is length r as computed earlier. So triangle ABO has AB=OA=r. Also, OB is from O(0,0) to B(-r/2, √3 r/2). The length of OB is sqrt[ (-r/2)^2 + (√3 r / 2)^2 ] = sqrt[r²/4 + 3 r²/4] = sqrt(r²)=r. So triangle ABO has all sides equal: AB=OA=OB=r. Therefore, triangle ABO is equilateral! All sides equal, so all angles are 60 degrees. Hence, angle ABO is 60 degrees. So answer D.

Wait, but why does the problem mention that angle ABC is 90 degrees? Because ABC is a right triangle. But in this case, angle ABC is 90 degrees, which aligns with Thales' theorem. So everything checks out.

But wait, let me confirm once more. In triangle ABC, right-angled at B, with AC as diameter. AB = AO, which is radius. So AB = r. And in this setup, triangle ABO is equilateral. Thus angle ABO is 60 degrees. Therefore, the answer is D.60°, which is option D.
