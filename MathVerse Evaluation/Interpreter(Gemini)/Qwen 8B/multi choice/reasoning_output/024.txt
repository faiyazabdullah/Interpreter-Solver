MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have two lines, a and b, which are parallel. They intersect another line c at points a and b respectively. There's an angle 1 measuring 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 2. The options are A:150°, B:130°, C:100°, D:50°.

First, I should recall some basics about parallel lines and transversals. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, several angle relationships come into play. Like corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Wait, but here there are two parallel lines, a and b, and line c is acting as the transversal? Or maybe line c is another transversal?

Wait, the problem says line a and line b are parallel and they intersect line c at points a and b. Hmm, so line c is crossing both lines a and b. Let me visualize this. Line a and line b are parallel, and line c intersects them at points a and b. So line c is like a transversal cutting through the two parallel lines. That setup creates several angles. 

Now, angle 1 is given as 50 degrees. But where is angle 1 located? Since the problem mentions angle 1 and angle 2, I need to figure out their positions. Typically, in such problems, angle 1 could be one of the angles formed by the transversal with the parallel lines. For example, if line c crosses line a at point a, creating an angle, and similarly crosses line b at point b, creating another angle. Depending on which angles they are, their measures relate via the properties of parallel lines.

Let me think. If line c is a transversal cutting through parallel lines a and b, then the angles formed would have certain relationships. Suppose angle 1 is one of the angles at the intersection of line c and line a. Then angle 2 could be either a corresponding angle, alternate interior angle, or perhaps a same-side interior angle. 

But since the problem doesn't specify the exact positions, I need to consider standard cases. Let's assume angle 1 is an angle formed at the intersection of line a and line c. Let's say it's an acute angle. Then, depending on where angle 2 is, its measure would vary. 

For instance, if angle 1 is on one side of line c, then angle 2 could be the corresponding angle on the other parallel line, making them equal. Alternatively, if angle 2 is a consecutive interior angle (same-side interior), then they would add up to 180 degrees. 

Given that angle 1 is 50 degrees, if angle 2 is a consecutive interior angle, then angle 2 would be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. That would make angle 2 equal to 130 degrees. Alternatively, if angle 2 were vertical or corresponding, it would also be 50 degrees. However, looking at the answer choices, 130 is option B, and 50 is option D. So I need to figure out which case applies here.

Another possibility: if angle 1 and angle 2 are vertical angles, they'd be equal. But vertical angles are formed by two intersecting lines. Here, since line c intersects line a and line b, each intersection forms four angles. So angle 1 might be at one intersection, and angle 2 at the other. If they're vertical angles, then they'd be equal. But if they're supplementary, then they'd add to 180.

Wait, but the problem states that lines a and b are parallel, intersected by line c. So line c is a transversal. In that case, the angles formed on the same side of the transversal (consecutive interior angles) are supplementary. So if angle 1 is on one side of line c, then the angle on the same side of line c with line b would be supplementary. Therefore, angle 2 would be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. That seems likely. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles, then they would be equal. But that would mean angle 2 is 50 degrees. However, without knowing the exact configuration, how do we decide?

But the problem mentions angle 1 and angle 2. Maybe the diagram shows that angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the transversal with line a, and angle 2 is the corresponding angle with line b. In that case, they would be equal. But then why would the answer not be D? Unless the angles are on different sides. 

Wait, sometimes diagrams can show different configurations. For example, if angle 1 is an acute angle inside the space between the two parallel lines, then angle 2 could be an obtuse angle outside. But again, depends on the position.

Wait, perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary. For instance, if they are same-side interior angles. Let me check: same-side interior angles are on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines. Their sum is 180 degrees. So if angle 1 is one of those, then angle 2 would be 180 - 50 = 130. Hence, answer B.

Alternatively, if angle 2 is an alternate interior angle with angle 1, then they would be equal. But then angle 2 would be 50 degrees, answer D. Which is it?

Hmm. Without seeing the diagram, it's ambiguous. But in many standard problems, if angle 1 is given as 50 degrees, and angle 2 is the consecutive interior angle, then answer B. But maybe the problem refers to another pair of angles. 

Wait, the problem says "they intersect the line c at a and b respectively". So line a and line b are parallel, and line c passes through them at points a and b. So line c is intersecting line a at point a, and line b at point b. So, the angles formed at these intersections. 

So, imagine two horizontal parallel lines, a and b. Line c is a slant line crossing line a at point a and line b at point b. At the intersection of line a and c, there are four angles. Similarly at the intersection of line b and c. 

Suppose angle 1 is one of the angles at the intersection of line a and c. Let's say it's the angle between line a and line c, on one side. Then, the corresponding angle at the intersection of line b and c would be equal to angle 1. But if angle 2 is the angle adjacent to angle 1 at the same intersection, then it would be supplementary. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 is the same-side interior angle, then it would be supplementary. So, for example, if angle 1 is on one side of line c (say, above line a), then angle 2 could be on the same side of line c but at the other parallel line, hence forming a consecutive interior angle. Thus, adding up to 180. 

Therefore, if angle 1 is 50 degrees, angle 2 would be 130 degrees. So answer B. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 is a vertical angle with angle 1, then they would be equal. But unless specified, it's more likely that they are supplementary. 

Since the answer options include 130° (option B), and 50° (option D). Given that in typical textbook problems, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, and you have a given angle, often the question asks for the consecutive interior angle. So I think the answer is B:130°.
