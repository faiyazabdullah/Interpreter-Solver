A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is whether a parabola that passes through the point (0,2) and opens upwards has an inverse function. The answer choices are A: Yes or B: No. 

First, I need to recall what an inverse function means. An inverse function essentially undoes what the original function does. For a function to have an inverse, it needs to be bijective, meaning it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). But since we're dealing with real numbers here, the main concern is whether the function is one-to-one. Because if a function isn't one-to-one, its inverse won't exist unless we restrict the domain.

Now, how do I check if the parabola is one-to-one? Well, parabolas are U-shaped graphs. If they open upwards or downwards, they are symmetric about their vertical axis. Wait, but if the parabola opens upwards, like the standard y = ax² + bx + c, then it's going to have a minimum point. Since it's symmetric, each horizontal line above the vertex would intersect the parabola at two points. That means the function isn't one-to-one because there are different x-values that give the same y-value. Therefore, the function isn't injective, so it doesn't have an inverse unless we restrict the domain.

But wait, the problem says the parabola passes through (0,2). Let me think. The general form of a parabola opening upwards is y = ax² + bx + c. Plugging in x=0 gives y = c, so c must be 2. So the equation becomes y = ax² + bx + 2. However, without knowing more points, maybe the specific shape depends on a and b. But regardless of the coefficients, as long as it's a standard upward-opening parabola, it's symmetric about its vertex. Hence, it's not one-to-one over its entire domain. 

Wait, but could there be a case where even though it's a parabola opening upwards, it's still invertible? Like if it's restricted? But the question doesn't mention restricting the domain. It just asks about the graph as a whole. So if the entire graph is considered, the function isn't one-to-one. Therefore, it doesn't have an inverse function. 

Alternatively, maybe there's something about the specific point (0,2) affecting this? For example, if the vertex is at (0,2), then the parabola is symmetric around the y-axis. In that case, yes, it's symmetric and thus not one-to-one. But if the vertex is somewhere else, maybe the symmetry is along a different vertical line. But even so, the parabola would still be symmetric, leading to multiple x-values mapping to the same y-value. 

So regardless of where the vertex is, as long as it's an upward-opening parabola, it's not one-to-one. Therefore, the answer should be B: No. 

But wait, another thought: maybe the problem is referring to the inverse relation rather than the inverse function. But the question specifically mentions "inverse functions," which requires the function to pass the horizontal line test. Since the parabola fails the horizontal line test (as it's symmetric), the inverse isn't a function. So the answer is B.
