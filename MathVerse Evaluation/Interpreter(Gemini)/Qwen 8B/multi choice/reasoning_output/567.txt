MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is whether the functions f(x) and g(x) have the same concavity. The options are about whether they're both concave up, both down, or opposite. 

First, I need to recall what determines the concavity of a quadratic function. From what I remember, a quadratic function in the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c has a parabola that opens upwards if the coefficient 'a' is positive and downwards if 'a' is negative. The concavity is determined by the sign of the leading coefficient.

Looking at the given information, the problem mentions two functions: f(x) = 4x² - 108 and g(x), which is described as a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex at (-5, 6). 

Let me start by analyzing f(x). The standard form is already given here: f(x) = 4x² - 108. Comparing this to the general quadratic equation, the coefficient 'a' is 4. Since 4 is positive, this means the parabola opens upwards. Therefore, f(x) is concave up.

Now, for g(x). The problem states it's a quadratic function opening downward. That directly tells me that the coefficient of x² in g(x) is negative. But wait, how do I confirm this? Well, the vertex is given as (-5, 6). For a quadratic function, the vertex form is usually written as f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Here, since the vertex is (-5, 6), substituting h = -5 and k = 6 gives us f(x) = a(x + 5)^2 + 6. 

But the problem says g(x) is a quadratic function opening downward, so the coefficient 'a' must be negative. Thus, regardless of the specific value of 'a', the direction of opening is determined by its sign. Therefore, g(x) is concave down because it opens downward.

Wait, but the question is whether f(x) and g(x) have the same concavity. Since f(x) is concave up (as a=4>0) and g(x) is concave down (since it opens downward), their concavities are different. 

So looking back at the answer choices: Option C says No, f is concave up and g is concave down. That matches our conclusion. Let me check again to make sure I didn't mix anything up. 

Another way to think: The vertex of g(x) is given, but the concavity depends on the coefficient, not the vertex position. The vertex location affects where the maximum or minimum is, but the direction is determined by the coefficient. Since the problem explicitly states that g(x) opens downward, that confirms concave down. And f(x)'s coefficient is positive, so concave up. Hence, they are opposites. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be C.
