MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the range of the piecewise function g, which consists of two segments: one from point A(-5,0) to B(-2,9), and another from B(-2,9) to C(4,-4). The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out which one correctly describes the range of g.

First, I should recall that the range of a function refers to all the possible output values (y-values) it can take. Since g is defined as a piecewise function made up of two line segments, the range would be all the y-values covered by these segments.

Let me start by visualizing the points. Point A is at (-5,0), B is at (-2,9), and C is at (4,-4). The first segment connects A to B, and the second connects B to C. So, the entire graph of g is two connected line segments forming a broken line from A to C via B.

To find the range, I need to determine the minimum and maximum y-values along these two segments. Let me analyze each segment separately.

Starting with the first segment AB: from (-5,0) to (-2,9). The y-values here go from 0 (at point A) up to 9 (at point B). So, the y-values on this segment range from 0 to 9.

Now, the second segment BC: from (-2,9) to (4,-4). Here, the starting y-value is 9 (at B) and ends at -4 (at C). Therefore, the y-values on this segment decrease from 9 down to -4. 

Putting both segments together, the overall range of g would be from the lowest y-value, which is -4 (from point C), up to the highest y-value, which is 9 (from point B). Wait, but do these segments cover all the values between those extremes? Well, since they're straight lines, yes. For example, the first segment goes from 0 to 9, covering all values in between, and the second goes from 9 down to -4, covering all values in between. So combining them, the total range is from -4 to 9.

Looking at the answer choices: Option A says -4 ≤ g(x) ≤ 9, which matches this conclusion. However, let me check if there are any other considerations. Are there any restrictions on x-values? But the question is about the range, which is purely about y-values. Also, the answer options don't mention anything about x-values, so focusing on y is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure there isn't a mistake here. Let me confirm by calculating equations of the lines.

For segment AB: Points A(-5,0) and B(-2,9). The slope (m) is (9 - 0)/(-2 - (-5)) = 9 / 3 = 3. The equation of the line can be written as y - 0 = 3(x +5), so y = 3x +15. Wait, plugging in x=-5 gives y=0, which is correct. At x=-2, y=3*(-2)+15= -6+15=9, correct. Now, the y-values here depend on x. But since we're looking for the range, the maximum y here is 9 (at x=-2) and the minimum is 0 (at x=-5). However, the segment AB is from x=-5 to x=-2. So the y-values on this part go from 0 to 9.

Then, for segment BC: Points B(-2,9) and C(4,-4). The slope is (-4 - 9)/(4 - (-2)) = (-13)/6 ≈ -2.1667. The equation of the line can be found using point-slope form. Using point B: y -9 = (-13/6)(x +2). To find the y-values, when x increases from -2 to 4, y decreases from 9 to -4. So the minimum y here is -4, and maximum is 9.

Therefore, combining both segments, the overall range is from -4 to 9. Hence, the correct answer should be option A: -4 ≤ g(x) ≤ 9. Let me check the answer choices again. Yes, option A is exactly that. Other options like B and D have different ranges, and C lists specific points which aren't the full range. So the answer is A.
