====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the remaining area when we subtract the area of two rectangles. Let me parse the given predicates first.

We have Rectangle(1) with AreaOf(1) being 6096, and Rectangle(2) with AreaOf(2) being 6000. Then there's a Sub(AreaOf(1), AreaOf(2)), which I think means subtraction. The question asks how much area is remaining, implying that we need to find the difference between these two areas.

Wait, the total area is given as 6096. But the first rectangle's area is also 6096. Maybe the total area refers to the sum of both rectangles? Or perhaps it's the area of the first rectangle, and we're subtracting the second one? Let me re-read the problem.

The problem states: "The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?" Given that there are two rectangles with areas 6096 and 6000, and a subtraction operation between them. So maybe the total area initially was 6096, and then we subtract the area of the second rectangle (6000) to find the remaining area. That would make sense. 

So if the total area starts at 6096, and we subtract 6000, the remaining area would be 6096 - 6000 = 96. Therefore, the answer should be 96. But wait, the answer choices aren't listed here. However, the user mentioned that there are no choices found, but the system requires selecting one of A-D. Since the calculation leads to 96, but without knowing the options, maybe the answer is 96, so if the options included 96, choose that. But since the original problem didn't list choices, perhaps the expected answer is 96. But according to the instructions, even though there are no choices, the assistant has to pick one of A-D. Wait, the initial message says "ANSWER CHOICES: No choices found." So maybe the answer isn't among the options, but the user expects us to proceed regardless. But the problem statement says "select the correct answer choice," but there are none. Hmm, maybe there was a mistake in the setup. However, the user instructed to provide the answer as per the process and end with Final Answer: A/B/C/D. Assuming that the answer is 96, but since the choices aren't given, perhaps the intended answer is 96, and if the options were A=96, then A. Otherwise, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant something else. Wait, the Sub(AreaOf(1), AreaOf(2)) could imply that the first area minus the second is the remaining. So 6096 - 6000 = 96. Hence, the remaining area is 96. So the answer is 96. But since there are no choices, but the user wants us to choose A-D, perhaps the answer is A. But this is unclear. However, following the problem's structure, the answer is 96. Assuming that the options had 96 as option A, then the answer would be A. Without seeing the actual choices, but based on the given data, the answer is 96. So I'll go with that.
