MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is about whether a certain line has an inverse function. The line in question passes through the points (-6, 0) and (0, 2), and it has a positive slope. The options are Yes or No.

Hmm, inverse functions... Right, for a function to have an inverse, it needs to be bijective, meaning it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). But since we're dealing with real numbers here, maybe the key point is whether the function is one-to-one. For linear functions, if they're strictly increasing or decreasing, they are one-to-one because they pass the horizontal line test. So, if the line has a positive slope, it's strictly increasing, so it should have an inverse.

Wait, but the problem mentions the line passing through those two points. Let me confirm the slope first. The two points are (-6, 0) and (0, 2). The slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Plugging in, that would be (2 - 0)/(0 - (-6)) = 2/6 = 1/3. So the slope is positive, which confirms the line is increasing. Therefore, each x-value maps to a unique y-value, making it one-to-one. Hence, the inverse exists.

But wait, could there be any issues? Like, maybe the line isn't a function? Wait, no. A vertical line isn't a function, but this line isn't vertical. Since the slope is 1/3, it's a straight line with a defined slope, so it's definitely a function. And since it's strictly increasing, it's one-to-one. Therefore, the inverse function exists. 

So the answer should be Yes, which corresponds to choice A. Let me check again. The line is y = (1/3)x + 2. Solving for x gives x = 3(y - 2), so the inverse function is x = 3y - 6, which is also a function. Yep, that works. So the inverse exists. Therefore, the answer is A.
