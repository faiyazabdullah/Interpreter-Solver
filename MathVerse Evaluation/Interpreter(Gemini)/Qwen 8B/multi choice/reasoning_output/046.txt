Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the given information is that AB is parallel to CD, angle A is 70 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 1. The answer choices are A:20°, B:30°, C:70°, D:110°. 

First, I should recall some geometry concepts related to parallel lines and angles. When two lines are parallel, certain angle relationships occur. For example, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. But wait, I need to visualize the diagram here since it's mentioned as "as shown in the figure," but there's no figure provided. Hmm, that could be tricky. However, maybe the standard configuration applies here.

Assuming that AB and CD are two parallel lines, and perhaps there's a transversal cutting them. Since angle A is mentioned, point A is likely one endpoint of line AB. Let me try to sketch mentally. Suppose AB is a horizontal line, and CD is another horizontal line parallel to AB. Then, angle A would be at point A, so maybe angle between AB and another line? Wait, but angle A is given as 70 degrees. Maybe there's a triangle involved?

Wait, the predicates mention Line(A,B) and Line(C,D). Also, Angle(A) and Angle(1). So, angle A is probably at vertex A, formed by lines meeting at A. If AB is part of that, maybe there's another line connected to A forming angle A. Let me think. If AB is parallel to CD, and angle A is at point A, then maybe there's a transversal creating angles. For instance, if there's a line connecting A to a point on CD, forming some intersecting lines. Alternatively, angle 1 could be an alternate interior angle or something similar.

Alternatively, maybe it's a trapezoid where AB and CD are the two bases, and AD and BC are the legs. In that case, angle A and angle D would be adjacent angles on the same side, which are supplementary if the sides are parallel. Wait, but angle A is given as 70 degrees. If AB || CD, then consecutive interior angles would add up to 180 degrees. So if angle A is 70°, then angle D would be 180 - 70 = 110°. But angle 1 is referred to, so maybe angle 1 is angle D? Or maybe angle 1 is another angle formed by a transversal.

But without seeing the figure, it's challenging. However, common configurations with parallel lines and angles often involve transversals. Let me consider that angle A is formed by AB and another line, say AE, making angle A. If CD is parallel to AB, then a transversal crossing them would form corresponding angles. Suppose angle 1 is a corresponding angle to angle A, then they'd be equal. But angle A is 70°, so angle 1 would also be 70°, which is option C. But that seems too straightforward, and maybe angle 1 is not directly corresponding.

Another possibility is that angle 1 is an alternate interior angle. If there's a transversal cutting AB and CD, then alternate interior angles would be equal. But again, unless we know the position of angle 1, it's hard to tell. Wait, maybe angle 1 is the angle formed at the intersection of lines AD and CD? Wait, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D. If AB is parallel to CD, and assuming that AD is a transversal, then angle at A (angle A) and angle at D (if it's on CD) would be consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. So angle A + angle D = 180°, so angle D would be 110°, which would make angle 1 possibly 110°, which is option D.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is a vertical angle or corresponding angle. Wait, but if angle A is 70°, and AB || CD, then depending on where angle 1 is located, it could be either 70°, 110°, or something else. Another thought: if there's a triangle involved. Suppose there's a triangle with angle A being 70°, and lines AB and CD are parallel, leading to some other angles. For example, if there's a triangle ABC where AB is extended and intersects with CD, creating some angles. But without more info, this is speculative.

Wait, the problem mentions Angle(1), which suggests that angle 1 is labeled somewhere in the figure. Commonly, in such problems, angle 1 might be an alternate interior angle or a corresponding angle. For example, if a transversal crosses AB and CD, creating angles. If angle A is at the intersection of AB and a transversal, then angle 1 could be the corresponding angle on the other line. But if angle A is 70°, then angle 1 would be 70°, making option C. But why would that be the case?

Alternatively, if angle 1 is a consecutive interior angle with angle A, then they would sum to 180°, making angle 1 = 110°, which is option D. That seems plausible. Which scenario is more likely?

Since the answer options have both 70° and 110°, and given that angle A is 70°, the key is determining the relationship between angle A and angle 1. If angle 1 is a consecutive interior angle, then yes, 110°. But if it's a corresponding angle, then 70°. Without the figure, this is ambiguous. However, considering standard textbook problems, when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, and an angle on one line is given, the corresponding angle is equal, and the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. 

Wait, but angle A is at point A, so if AB is parallel to CD, and suppose there's a transversal that creates angle A and angle 1. If angle A is on the upper line AB, and angle 1 is on the lower line CD, then depending on the transversal's direction. For example, if the transversal is AD, then angle at A and angle at D would be consecutive interior angles, adding to 180°, so angle 1 (at D) would be 110°, hence answer D. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle with angle A, then they would be equal, so 70°, answer C. 

So how do we decide between these two possibilities? Well, the problem states that angle A is 70°, and asks for angle 1. In many standard problems, when you have two parallel lines cut by a transversal, the angles formed can be categorized. If angle A is one of the angles on the top line, then depending on where angle 1 is placed, it could be either corresponding, alternate, or consecutive. 

But since the answer options include both 70 and 110, and given that angle A is 70°, if angle 1 is a corresponding angle, then answer C. If it's a consecutive interior angle, answer D. 

However, considering that angle A is at point A, which is on line AB, and angle 1 might be at the intersection of line CD and another line. If the lines AB and CD are parallel, and there's a transversal that forms angle A and angle 1. For example, if line AC is a transversal, then angle at A and angle at C might be related. Wait, but the points mentioned are C and D. Line(C,D) is given. 

Maybe the figure has AB and CD as two parallel lines, with AD and BC as the other sides of a parallelogram or trapezoid. If AB || CD, then angles at A and D are supplementary. So angle A is 70°, so angle D is 110°, making angle 1 potentially 110°, which would be answer D. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle with angle A, then it would be 70°, answer C. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's a bit ambiguous. However, in many cases, when you have two parallel lines and a transversal, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle A is on one line, the consecutive interior angle on the other line would be 180 - 70 = 110°, which would be angle 1. Hence, the answer would be D:110°. 

Therefore, based on typical scenarios, the answer is D.
