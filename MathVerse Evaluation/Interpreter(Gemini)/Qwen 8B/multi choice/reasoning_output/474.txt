MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question says there are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. We need to write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation. Hmm, wait, but the number line itself is infinite in both directions unless specified otherwise. But maybe the points mentioned are part of a segment?

Wait, the given predicates are Point(-2), Point(1), and Line(-2,1). Oh, so the line is connecting the points at -2 and 1. That would mean the line segment between those two points. So the number line here refers to the line containing these two points. But the question asks for the set of numbers represented on the number line. Wait, if it's just the line segment between -2 and 1, then the numbers on that segment would be all real numbers between -2 and 1, inclusive? Or exclusive?

But the problem mentions "the number line," which typically extends infinitely in both directions. However, since there's a line defined between -2 and 1, maybe they're considering the entire line, but the points given are just markers. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read.

The problem states: "Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation." Given that there are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Wait, perhaps the line is the number line, and the two points are marked at -2 and 1. Then the set of numbers on the number line would be all real numbers, but that doesn't make sense because the options aren't given. Wait, the answer choices are missing, but the user said "No choices found." Maybe the original problem had choices, but in this case, we have to infer.

Alternatively, perhaps the line is the segment between -2 and 1, so the numbers on that line segment would be from -2 to 1. But interval notation for that would be [-2, 1]. But the problem says "number line," which usually is infinite. However, since the given line connects those two points, maybe it's referring to the segment. But how do we know if it's open or closed?

Wait, the points are included, so the endpoints are part of the set. Therefore, the interval would be from -2 to 1, including both ends. Hence, the interval notation is [-2, 1]. But since the answer choices are not provided, and the user says "No choices found," I guess the answer is supposed to be written as such. But according to the instructions, I need to pick one of the answer choices, but since there are none, maybe the system expects me to output the correct interval notation directly. However, the user's instruction says to choose from answer choices, but there are none. This seems conflicting.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement again. It says "Write the set of numbers represented on the number on the number line in interval notation." Wait, maybe there's confusion here. If the line is the entire number line, then the set is all real numbers, which is (-∞, ∞). But since there are points at -2 and 1, maybe the problem is referring to the segment between them. Alternatively, maybe the line is the x-axis, and the points are on it, but the question is about the entire number line. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in a coordinate system where the number line is the real line, and the two points are just markers. But the question is about the set of numbers on the number line, which would still be all real numbers. However, the presence of points at -2 and 1 may imply something else. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is in a different context. For example, if the line is considered as a subset of the number line, like the segment between -2 and 1. In that case, the numbers on that line segment would be all real numbers between -2 and 1, inclusive. So interval notation would be [-2, 1].

Since the problem mentions "the number line" but gives a line connecting -2 and 1, it's likely referring to the segment between those two points. Thus, the answer should be [-2, 1]. Since there are no answer choices, but the user instructed to pick one, maybe the intended answer is that interval. Therefore, I'll go with that.
