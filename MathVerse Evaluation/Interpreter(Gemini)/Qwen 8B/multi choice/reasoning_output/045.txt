MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle with center O, and points A, B, and C on the circle. Angle C is given as 35 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle AOB. 

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since O is the center, OA, OB, and OC are radii of the circle. That means OA = OB = OC because all radii of a circle are equal. Also, since A, B, and C are points on the circle, AB and BC are chords of the circle.

Now, angle C is mentioned. Wait, angle at point C? Let me visualize this. Point C is on the circumference, so angle ACB would be an inscribed angle. But wait, the problem says angle C is 35 degrees. Maybe it refers to angle ACB? Or maybe angle at point C involving other points? Let me check the predicates again. The predicate mentions Angle(A,C,B) which is angle at point C between points A and B. So angle ACB is 35 degrees. 

Since angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AB, the measure of the inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc. The central angle here would be angle AOB. Because angle AOB is the central angle corresponding to arc AB. Therefore, according to the inscribed angle theorem, angle ACB equals half of angle AOB. 

So if angle ACB is 35 degrees, then angle AOB would be twice that, which is 70 degrees. That seems straightforward. Let me confirm. The inscribed angle theorem states that an angle θ formed by two chords in a circle with vertex on the circumference is half the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc. Therefore, angle ACB (which is inscribed) is half of angle AOB (central). Hence, angle AOB = 2 * 35° = 70°. 

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 70°, so the answer should be B. Let me make sure there are no other factors. Are there any other angles or relationships that could affect this? For example, is there a possibility that angle C refers to something else? The problem says angle C is 35°, but in the predicates, they mention Angle(A,C,B) which is angle ACB. So yes, that's the inscribed angle. 

Another thing to check: are there any other arcs involved? For instance, if point C is part of another chord or something. But since C is just another point on the circle, and the problem gives us that AB and BC are chords. However, angle ACB is specifically about arc AB. So the calculation holds. 

Therefore, the measure of angle AOB is 70 degrees, which corresponds to answer choice B.
