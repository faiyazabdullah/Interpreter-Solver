MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have points A, B, and C on a circle with center O. The angles given are angle ABO = 40 degrees and angle ACO = 30 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle BOC. 

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since O is the center, OA, OB, and OC are radii of the circle. That means OA = OB = OC because all radii of a circle are equal. So triangles OAB, OAC, and OBC are all isosceles triangles. Wait, but the problem mentions that triangles ABO and ACO are isosceles. Let me check the given predicates again. Yes, it says Isosceles(Triangle(A,B,O)) and Isosceles(Triangle(A,C,O)). So those triangles have two sides equal. But since OA, OB, OC are radii, then in triangle ABO, sides OB and OA are radii, so OA=OB. Similarly, in triangle ACO, OA=OC. Therefore, triangles ABO and ACO are isosceles with OA=OB and OA=OC respectively.

Now, looking at angle ABO = 40 degrees. In triangle ABO, since OA=OB, the base angles are equal. Wait, angle at B is angle ABO, which is given as 40 degrees. Wait, triangle ABO has vertices A, B, O. So the angles are at A, B, and O. Since OA=OB, the angles opposite those sides would be equal. Wait, OA and OB are the two equal sides, so the angles opposite them would be angles at B and A? Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle ABO, side OA is opposite angle B, and side OB is opposite angle A. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, in triangle ABO, the sides are AB, BO, and AO. Since OA and OB are both radii, they are equal. Therefore, triangle ABO is isosceles with OA = OB. Therefore, the angles opposite these sides are equal. The side OA is opposite angle B, and side OB is opposite angle A. Wait, no. Let me clarify: In triangle ABC, each side is opposite the corresponding angle. So in triangle ABO, vertex A is connected to B and O. So angle at A is angle OAB, angle at B is angle ABO, and angle at O is angle AOB. Since OA and OB are equal, the angles opposite them would be equal. The side OA is opposite angle B (angle at B), and the side OB is opposite angle A (angle at A). Therefore, if OA = OB, then angle at B equals angle at A. Wait, but angle ABO is given as 40 degrees. So angle at B is 40 degrees. Then angle at A (OAB) would also be 40 degrees. Then the remaining angle at O (AOB) would be 180 - 40 -40 = 100 degrees. So angle AOB is 100 degrees. Similarly, for triangle ACO, where OA=OC, so triangle ACO is isosceles with OA=OC. Given angle ACO is 30 degrees. Angle at C is angle ACO = 30 degrees, so angle at A (OAC) would also be 30 degrees. Then angle at O (AOC) would be 180 - 30 -30 = 120 degrees. 

So angle AOB is 100 degrees, angle AOC is 120 degrees. Now, how do these relate to angle BOC? Well, considering the entire circle, the sum of angles around point O would be 360 degrees. But points A, B, C are on the circumference, so the central angles AOB, BOC, and COA would add up to 360 degrees. Wait, but we have angle AOB = 100 degrees, angle AOC = 120 degrees. However, angle BOC is the one we need to find. Wait, perhaps there's another way. Let me visualize the circle with points A, B, C. The central angles between each pair of points. 

Alternatively, since angles AOB and AOC are known, maybe angle BOC can be found by subtracting from 360 degrees? Wait, but that depends on the order of the points on the circle. Are points B and C positioned such that moving from A to B to C around the circle? Or could they be arranged differently? Hmm, but without knowing the exact positions, perhaps we need another approach.

Wait, another idea: the central angles correspond to twice the inscribed angles subtended by the same arc. Wait, but in this case, the angles given are not necessarily inscribed angles. For example, angle ABO is an angle at point B, which is on the circumference. Wait, angle ABO is part of triangle ABO. Let me think about that. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the central angle is twice the inscribed angle subtending the same arc. But angle ABO is not an inscribed angle; it's an angle formed by a tangent and a chord? No, wait, O is the center, so BA is a chord, and OB is a radius. Wait, angle ABO is at point B, between points A, B, O. So that's an angle inside the triangle ABO. 

But earlier, I thought that angle ABO is 40 degrees, leading us to calculate angle AOB as 100 degrees. Similarly, angle ACO is 30 degrees, leading to angle AOC being 120 degrees. Now, if we consider that the total around point O is 360 degrees, then angle BOC = 360 - angle AOB - angle AOC. Wait, but that would be 360 - 100 - 120 = 140 degrees. Which would be option D. But wait, is that accurate?

Wait, but the points A, B, C are placed on the circle. Depending on their arrangement, the central angles may or may not add up directly. Suppose that the points are arranged in the order A, B, C around the circle. Then the central angles would be AOB, BOC, and COA. But if that's the case, then angle AOB + angle BOC + angle COA = 360 degrees. However, angle AOC is the same as angle AOB + angle BOC if the points are ordered A, B, C. Wait, no. If you go from A to O to C, then angle AOC would be the sum of angles AOB and BOC if B lies between A and C on the circle. 

But in our case, angle AOC was calculated as 120 degrees. And angle AOB is 100 degrees. If angle AOC is the angle between OA and OC, which could be the sum of AOB and BOC if B is between A and C. So angle AOC = angle AOB + angle BOC. Therefore, angle BOC = angle AOC - angle AOB = 120 - 100 = 20 degrees. But that contradicts the previous calculation. So this suggests inconsistency. Hence, my initial assumption might be wrong.

Wait, this indicates that I need to re-examine the relationship between angles AOB, AOC, and BOC. Maybe the points are not in the order A, B, C. Alternatively, perhaps angle AOC is not the sum of AOB and BOC. So maybe I need to use another approach.

Let me start over. Since O is the center, OA, OB, OC are radii. So OA = OB = OC. In triangle ABO, OA = OB, making it isosceles with base AB. The given angle is angle ABO = 40 degrees. In triangle ABO, angles at A and B are equal? Wait, no. Because OA and OB are the two equal sides, so the base is AB, and the apex is at O. Therefore, the base angles are at A and B. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle ABO, the two equal sides are OA and OB. Therefore, the angles opposite these sides are equal. The side OA is opposite angle at B (which is angle ABO), and the side OB is opposite angle at A (which is angle OAB). Therefore, angle ABO = angle OAB. Given that angle ABO is 40 degrees, so angle OAB is also 40 degrees. Then the third angle at O (angle AOB) is 180 - 40 - 40 = 100 degrees. So angle AOB is 100 degrees. Similarly, in triangle ACO, OA = OC (since they're radii), so triangle ACO is isosceles with OA = OC. Given angle ACO is 30 degrees, which is the angle at C. So angle at C (ACO) is 30 degrees, so angle at A (OAC) is also 30 degrees. Then angle at O (angle AOC) is 180 - 30 - 30 = 120 degrees. 

Now, angle AOB is 100 degrees, angle AOC is 120 degrees. How does this relate to angle BOC? 

Imagine the circle with center O, and points A, B, C on the circumference. The central angles between each pair of points. Let's denote:

- angle AOB = 100 degrees
- angle AOC = 120 degrees
- angle BOC = ?

Assuming that the points are arranged such that going from A to B to C around the circle, then angle AOB + angle BOC = angle AOC. But if angle AOC is 120 degrees and angle AOB is 100 degrees, then angle BOC would be 120 - 100 = 20 degrees. But that seems too small. Also, the answer options don't include 20 degrees, so that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged differently. 

Another possibility: angle BOC could be the difference between angle AOC and angle AOB. But depending on the position of the points. Suppose that point B is located such that angle AOB is 100 degrees, and angle AOC is 120 degrees. If points B and C are on different arcs relative to A, then the angle BOC could be angle AOC - angle AOB if C is closer to A than B. But this is unclear without knowing the exact configuration. 

Alternatively, since OA, OB, OC are radii, we can think about vectors or coordinates. Let me try assigning coordinates. Let’s place point O at the origin. Let’s assume OA is along the x-axis for simplicity. Let’s say point A is at (r, 0), where r is the radius. 

Then, angle AOB is 100 degrees. So point B is located at an angle of 100 degrees from OA. So coordinates of B would be (r cos θ, r sin θ), where θ is 100 degrees. Similarly, angle AOC is 120 degrees, so point C is at angle 120 degrees from OA. Wait, but if angle AOC is the central angle between OA and OC, then yes. But if angle AOC is 120 degrees, then point C is at 120 degrees from OA. 

But then angle BOC would be the angle between OB and OC. If point B is at 100 degrees and point C is at 120 degrees, then the angle between OB and OC is 120 - 100 = 20 degrees. Again, 20 degrees isn't an option. This suggests a contradiction. 

Wait, but this assumes that points B and C are both on the same side of OA. However, maybe they are on opposite sides. For instance, if point B is at 100 degrees counterclockwise from OA, and point C is at 120 degrees clockwise from OA. Then the angle between OB and OC would be 100 + 120 = 220 degrees, but that's more than 180, which would make the smaller angle 140 degrees. So angle BOC would be 140 degrees. Which is option D. 

Ah! So depending on the direction of rotation, the angle BOC could be the larger arc or the smaller arc. Since angles in circles are typically considered as the smaller angle unless specified otherwise. However, in this case, if points are arranged such that the central angle between B and C is 140 degrees, then that would be the answer. 

But why would angle BOC be 140 degrees? Let me think again. If angle AOB is 100 degrees and angle AOC is 120 degrees, but if the points are arranged such that from OA, moving counterclockwise, we pass B first (at 100 degrees), then C is somewhere else. Wait, but if angle AOC is 120 degrees, that could mean that point C is either at +120 degrees or -120 degrees from OA. If point C is at -120 degrees (clockwise), then the angle between OB (at 100 degrees) and OC (at -120 degrees) would be 100 + 120 = 220 degrees, but the smaller angle between them is 360 - 220 = 140 degrees. Thus, angle BOC is 140 degrees. 

This aligns with option D. So the answer would be 140 degrees. 

But how did we arrive at that conclusion? By considering the positions of points B and C relative to OA. Since angle AOC is 120 degrees, which could be in the other direction. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a better way using the fact that the sum of angles around point O is 360 degrees. If angle AOB is 100 degrees, angle AOC is 120 degrees, and assuming that points B and C are on opposite sides of OA, then angle BOC would be 360 - (angle AOB + angle AOC) = 360 - 100 -120 = 140 degrees. 

Yes, that makes sense. So angle BOC is 140 degrees. Therefore, the answer is D.
