QUESTION:
This graph shows the relationship between the current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms) in an electrical circuit, when the voltage provided to the circuit is 240 V. The equation could be described as \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}}=\text{Current}

What happens to the current as the resistance increases?

CHOICES:
A:The current increases.
B:The current decreases.

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about how the current changes as resistance increases in an electrical circuit with a fixed voltage. The given equation is Current = 240 / Resistance. The answer choices are whether the current increases or decreases.

First, I need to recall some basic physics here. Ohm's Law states that Voltage equals Current multiplied by Resistance (V = IR). Rearranging that gives Current = Voltage / Resistance. Since the voltage is constant at 240 V, the current is inversely proportional to the resistance. That means if resistance goes up, current should go down, right? But wait, maybe I should verify this using the given predicates to make sure there's no trick here.

Looking at the provided predicates: There's a point at (0,0) lying on two lines, one vertical (from (0,0) to (0,50)) and one horizontal (from (0,0) to (50,0)). Also, those two lines are perpendicular. Hmm, so maybe this is illustrating a coordinate system where the x-axis is resistance and y-axis is current? Because typically, in such graphs, resistance would be on the x-axis and current on the y-axis. 

So plotting the relationship, if resistance (x) increases, the current (y) would decrease because it's an inverse relationship. For example, if resistance doubles, current halves. Let me think about the mathematical derivation here. The equation is Current = 240 / R. As R increases, the denominator gets larger, making the whole fraction smaller. Therefore, current decreases. 

But wait, the problem mentions a graph showing the relationship. The given points lie on perpendicular lines, which form a right angle. Maybe the graph is a hyperbola since it's an inverse proportionality. Hyperbolas have branches that approach the axes but never touch them. So as resistance increases along the x-axis, the current (on the y-axis) approaches zero but doesn't reach it. This confirms that increasing resistance leads to decreasing current.

I don't see any other factors mentioned here. The voltage is fixed, so no other variables are involved. All the geometric predicates seem to set up a coordinate system where the lines are axes, and the relationship is represented by the inverse function. So applying the math, the answer should be that current decreases when resistance increases. Hence, the correct choice is B.
