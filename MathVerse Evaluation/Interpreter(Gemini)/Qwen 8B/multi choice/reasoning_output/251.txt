MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a triangle with sides 29, 50, and 61. We need to find the measure of angle at point B, which is between points A, B, and C. Wait, actually, the angle mentioned is Angle(A,B,C), so that would be the angle at vertex B. Let me confirm: in triangle ABC, angle at B. 

First, I should recall how to find an angle in a triangle when all three sides are known. Oh right, the Law of Cosines! That's the formula that relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the cosine of one of its angles. The formula is c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C), where C is the angle opposite side c. 

So in this case, since we want the angle at B, which is between sides AB and BC. Wait, let me make sure about the notation. In triangle ABC, the angle at B is between sides AB and BC, so the sides adjacent to angle B are AB and BC, and the side opposite angle B is AC. 

Given the sides: AB is 29 units? Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says LengthOf(Line(A,B),29). So Line(A,B) has length 29. Then LengthOf(Line(B,C),50), so BC is 50. And LengthOf(Line(A,C),61), so AC is 61. Therefore, in triangle ABC, AB=29, BC=50, and AC=61. Wait, but wait, if AB is 29, BC is 50, then AC is 61. Let me check if these satisfy the triangle inequality. 29 + 50 = 79 > 61, 29 + 61 = 90 > 50, 50 + 61 = 111 > 29. Okay, valid triangle.

Now, to find angle at B. Using Law of Cosines here. Let me label the sides properly. Let me denote the triangle with vertices A, B, C. So angle at B. Let me call the sides opposite the angles as follows: side opposite angle A is BC, which is 50; side opposite angle B is AC, which is 61; side opposite angle C is AB, which is 29. Wait, maybe I need to clarify. Let me think again.

Law of Cosines states that for any triangle, c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). Here, angle B is the angle we're interested in. The sides adjacent to angle B are AB and BC. So AB is 29, BC is 50. The side opposite angle B is AC, which is 61. Therefore, applying the Law of Cosines:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2 * AB * BC * cos(angle B)

Plugging in the numbers:

61² = 29² + 50² - 2 * 29 * 50 * cos(angle B)

Let me compute each term. First, 61 squared. Let me calculate 61^2: 61*61. Well, 60^2 is 3600, plus 2*60*1 + 1^2 = 3600 + 120 + 1 = 3721. So 61² is 3721.

Then 29² is 841, and 50² is 2500. Adding those gives 841 + 2500 = 3341. 

So substituting back:

3721 = 3341 - 2 * 29 * 50 * cos(angle B)

Wait, no. Wait the equation is:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle B)

Therefore:

3721 = 841 + 2500 - 2 * 29 * 50 * cos(angle B)

Compute 841 + 2500: that's 3341. So:

3721 = 3341 - 2*29*50*cos(angle B)

Wait, but 3721 is larger than 3341. So rearranging:

3721 - 3341 = -2 * 29 * 50 * cos(angle B)

Calculating left side: 3721 - 3341 = 380.

So 380 = -2 * 29 * 50 * cos(angle B)

Wait, but that would mean cos(angle B) is negative because the right-hand side is negative. Wait, but angle B is part of a triangle, so it must be between 0 and 180 degrees. So cos(angle B) could be negative if the angle is obtuse. Which makes sense if the side opposite is longer than the other two sides. Wait, AC is 61, which is the longest side. Because AB is 29, BC is 50, AC is 61. So the largest side is AC, so the angle opposite to it, which is angle B, should be the largest angle. Since AC is the longest side, angle B is the largest angle. Therefore, it's likely obtuse. Hence, cosine would be negative. 

Proceeding with calculation:

380 = -2 * 29 * 50 * cos(angle B)

Let me compute 2 * 29 * 50 first. 2*50=100, 100*29=2900. So:

380 = -2900 * cos(angle B)

Therefore, cos(angle B) = -380 / 2900. Simplify that fraction. Divide numerator and denominator by 10: -38 / 290. Then divide numerator and denominator by 2: -19/145. Let me compute that decimal value. 19 divided by 145. Let me do division: 145 goes into 19 zero times. Add decimal: 190 divided by 145 is 1. So 1. Then 145*1=145, subtract from 190: 45. Bring down next 0: 450. 145*3=435, so 3. Subtract: 15. Bring down 0: 150. 145 goes once again, 145. Subtract: 5. Bring down 0: 50. 145 goes 0 times. So approximately 0.131... So -19/145 ≈ -0.131. So cos(angle B) ≈ -0.131. 

Now, to find angle B, take arccos(-0.131). Let me recall that arccos(-x) is 180° minus arccos(x). So first compute arccos(0.131). What's arccos(0.131)? Let me think. I know that cos(80°) is approx 0.1736, cos(82°)= approx 0.1392, cos(83°)= approx 0.1219. Wait, so 0.131 is between 82° and 83°. Let me try to approximate. 

At 82°, cos(82°) ≈ 0.1392. At 83°, cos(83°) ≈ 0.1219. Our value is 0.131. Let me see how much between 82° and 83°. The difference between 0.1392 and 0.1219 is approximately 0.0173 over 1 degree. Our target is 0.131, which is 0.1392 - 0.131 = 0.0082 less than 0.1392. So fraction is 0.0082 / 0.0173 ≈ 0.474. So approximately 82° + 0.474*(1°) ≈ 82.474°, so roughly 82.5°. Therefore, arccos(0.131) ≈ 82.5°, so arccos(-0.131) is 180° - 82.5° = 97.5°. 

But wait, our calculation was cos(angle B) ≈ -0.131. So angle B ≈ 97.5°. But the answer options are A:98, B:103, C:108, D:113. So 97.5 rounds to 98, which is option A. However, perhaps my approximation is slightly off. Let me check more accurately. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the value of cos(angle B).

Let me recalculate the earlier steps. Let's go back. 

We had:

cos(angle B) = -380 / (2*29*50) = -380/(2900) = -0.131034...

Yes, that's accurate. So arccos(-0.131034). Let me use a calculator method. Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Alternatively, maybe using more precise cosine values. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Law of Cosines directly with more precise computation. Let me recheck the initial equations. 

Original equation: 61² = 29² + 50² - 2*29*50*cos(angle B)

Calculate 61²: 3721, 29² + 50² = 841 + 2500 = 3341. Then:

3721 - 3341 = 380 = -2*29*50*cos(angle B)

Thus, 380 = -2900*cos(angle B)

Therefore, cos(angle B) = -380/2900 = -19/145 ≈ -0.131034...

Now, using a calculator for arccos(-0.131034). Let me think. For example, if I use a calculator, arccos(-0.131) is approximately?

Well, let me consider that cos(90°) = 0, cos(180°)=-1. So the angle is between 90° and 180°, as cosine is negative. Let me try to compute using inverse cosine tables or approximate methods. 

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator-like approach. Let me note that:

cos(90°) = 0

cos(97.5°): Let me compute cos(97.5°). Let me convert 97.5 degrees to radians if needed, but perhaps another way. Alternatively, knowing that 90° + 7.5°, so using the formula cos(90°+θ) = -sin θ. So cos(97.5°) = cos(90° + 7.5°) = -sin(7.5°). Sin(7.5°) is approx sin(π/24). Let me compute sin(7.5°). 

Using calculator-like estimation, sin(7.5°) ≈ 0.1305. Therefore, cos(97.5°) ≈ -0.1305. Comparing to our value of -0.131034. So that's very close. Thus, angle B is approximately 97.5°, which would round to 98°, matching option A. 

However, let me verify with more precise calculation. Suppose that cos(angle B) = -0.131034. Let me check what angle gives this. 

Since cos(97.5°) ≈ -0.1305, which is very close to our value. The difference between -0.1305 and -0.131034 is about -0.131034 - (-0.1305) = -0.000534. So slightly more negative. So the angle is slightly larger than 97.5°, since cosine decreases as the angle increases from 0° to 180°. So if the value is more negative, the angle is larger. 

How much larger? Let me estimate. Let’s suppose that between 97.5° and 98°, the cosine changes. Let me compute cos(97.5°) ≈ -0.1305, cos(98°). Let me compute cos(98°). 

Again, using the identity, cos(98°) = cos(90° + 8°) = -sin(8°). Sin(8°) ≈ 0.1392. So cos(98°) ≈ -0.1392. Wait, but that seems conflicting with previous. Wait, no: cos(98°) is cos(90°+8°)= -sin(8°) ≈ -0.1392. But our value is -0.131034, which is between -0.1305 (at 97.5°) and -0.1392 (at 98°). Wait, but -0.131034 is more negative than -0.1305, so the angle is between 97.5° and 98°. Let me find the exact value. 

Let me set up linear approximation between 97.5° and 98°. 

At 97.5°, cos = -0.1305

At 98°, cos = -0.1392

Our value is -0.131034. Let me compute how far between these two points. 

The difference between -0.1305 and -0.1392 is -0.1392 - (-0.1305) = -0.0087 over 0.5 degrees (from 97.5° to 98°). Our target is -0.131034, which is -0.1305 - 0.000534. So delta_x = (-0.131034 - (-0.1305)) / (-0.0087) ) * 0.5 degrees. Wait, sorry, perhaps better to write:

Let’s define f(theta) = cos(theta). We know f(97.5°) = -0.1305, f(98°) = -0.1392. We want theta such that f(theta) = -0.131034.

Assuming linearity between these two points (which isn't perfectly true, but for small intervals, it's an approximation):

The change in theta is 0.5 degrees, corresponding to a change in f(theta) of Δf = -0.1392 - (-0.1305) = -0.0087.

We need to find delta_theta such that f(theta) = -0.131034. Starting at 97.5°, which is -0.1305. The desired value is -0.131034, which is a decrease of 0.000534 from the starting point. So:

delta_f = -0.000534. 

Assuming linearity, delta_theta ≈ (delta_f / Δf) * total_delta_theta.

Which is (-0.000534 / -0.0087) * 0.5° ≈ (0.0534 / 0.0087) * 0.5° ≈ (approx 0.613) * 0.5° ≈ 0.3065°. 

So theta ≈ 97.5° + 0.3065° ≈ 97.8065°, so approximately 97.81°, which rounds to 98°. 

Therefore, angle B is approximately 97.8°, which rounds to 98°, making option A the correct answer. 

But let me check with another approach. Maybe using the Law of Cosines with more precise calculation. Alternatively, using the Law of Sines? Wait, but Law of Sines requires knowing an angle or another side. Since we don't have any angles yet, maybe not helpful. 

Alternatively, perhaps check if the triangle is a right triangle? Let me check if 29² + 50² equals 61²? 29² + 50² = 841 + 2500 = 3341. 61² is 3721. Not equal, so not a right triangle. 

Another thought: maybe I miscalculated something earlier. Let me double-check the Law of Cosines steps. 

Law of Cosines: c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos(C). Where C is the angle between sides a and b. 

In this case, angle B is between sides AB (29) and BC (50), and the side opposite angle B is AC (61). So yes, plugging into the formula:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle B)

So 61² = 29² + 50² - 2*29*50*cos(angle B)

Which leads to the same equation as before. 

So calculations seem correct. Therefore, the angle is approximately 97.8°, rounds to 98°, so answer A. 

Looking at the options, A is 98, which matches. However, sometimes when using calculators, the precise value may differ slightly due to rounding during intermediate steps. Let me check using more precise calculation. 

Alternatively, using a calculator (pretending I have one here), if I compute arccos(-19/145). Let me compute -19 divided by 145. Let me get a decimal: 19 ÷ 145. Let me compute that. 145 × 0.13 = 18.85, which is 19 - 18.85 = 0.15 remaining. So 0.13 + (0.15/145) ≈ 0.13 + 0.00103 ≈ 0.13103. So -0.13103. 

So arccos(-0.13103). Let me use a calculator for higher precision. Assuming access to a calculator, inputting arccos(-0.13103). 

Let me think of standard angles. For instance, if I take cos(97.5°) ≈ -0.1305 as before, and cos(97.8°). Let me compute cos(97.8°). 

Alternatively, using a calculator (hypothetically), if I compute 97.8 degrees, cos(97.8) ≈ ?

Alternatively, converting 97.8 degrees to radians: π radians = 180°, so 97.8° = 97.8 * π / 180 ≈ 1.704 radians. Compute cos(1.704). Using Taylor series? Not practical manually. Alternatively, using known values. 

Alternatively, accept that the precise value is around 97.8°, which rounds to 98°, so answer A. 

But wait, looking at the answer choices, option A is 98, B is 103. Is there a chance that my calculation is wrong? Let me check with another method. 

Alternative approach: using vectors or coordinates. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane. Let me put point B at origin (0,0), point C along x-axis at (50,0), since BC is 50 units. Point A somewhere in plane. AB is 29, AC is 61. Coordinates: B(0,0), C(50,0). Let me find coordinates of A. 

Coordinates of A satisfy distance from B(0,0) is 29: x² + y² = 29² = 841.

Distance from A to C(50,0) is 61: (x - 50)^2 + y² = 61² = 3721.

Subtract first equation from second:

(x - 50)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 3721 - 841 → expand (x² -100x + 2500) - x² = 2880 → -100x + 2500 = 2880 → -100x = 380 → x = -380 / 100 = -3.8. 

So x-coordinate of A is -3.8. Now, substitute back into x² + y² = 841:

(-3.8)^2 + y² = 841 → 14.44 + y² = 841 → y² = 841 - 14.44 = 826.56 → y = sqrt(826.56). Let me compute sqrt(826.56). Well, 28.7² = 823.69, 28.8² = 829.44. So 28.7^2 = 823.69, 826.56 - 823.69 = 2.87. So approx 28.7 + 2.87/(2*28.7) ≈ 28.7 + 0.05 ≈ 28.75. So y ≈ ±28.75. 

So coordinates of A are (-3.8, ~28.75). Now, angle at B is the angle between BA and BC. Vector BA is from B(0,0) to A(-3.8, 28.75): vector (-3.8, 28.75). Vector BC is from B(0,0) to C(50,0): vector (50, 0). 

To find angle between vectors BA and BC, which is angle at B. The formula for angle between vectors u and v is:

cos(theta) = (u · v)/(|u| |v|)

Compute the dot product of BA and BC vectors:

u · v = (-3.8)(50) + (28.75)(0) = -190 + 0 = -190.

|u| is |BA| = 29, as given. |v| is |BC| = 50.

Thus, cos(theta) = -190 / (29 * 50) = -190 / 1450 = -19/145 ≈ -0.13103, same as before. So theta = arccos(-0.13103) ≈ 97.8°, confirming the previous result. 

Therefore, the angle measures approximately 97.8°, which rounds to 98°, so answer A. 

But just to ensure there's no error in the problem setup. Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C), Var). So angle at B, between A-B-C. Yes, that's consistent with our analysis. 

Hence, the correct answer is A:98.
