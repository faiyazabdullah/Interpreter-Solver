MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the question is about whether a certain graph has an inverse function. The graph is described as a curve that passes through (0,0) and where y increases as x increases. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall what it means for a function to have an inverse. From my math classes, I remember that a function has an inverse if and only if it is bijective, meaning it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). But since we're dealing with real numbers here, maybe the key point is one-to-one. Because for inverses, each output must correspond to exactly one input. So if a function isn't one-to-one, like if it's not strictly increasing or decreasing, it won't have an inverse unless we restrict its domain.

Wait, but the problem says the graph is a curve passing through (0,0) and y increases as x increases. Hmm, so does that mean the function is strictly increasing? If the function is strictly increasing, then it would be one-to-one because each x corresponds to a unique y and vice versa. But wait, actually, even if a function is strictly increasing, it's still one-to-one. For example, f(x) = x^3 is strictly increasing and has an inverse. However, if the function isn't strictly increasing, say it has parts where it decreases, then there could be two different x-values with the same y-value, making it not one-to-one.

But the problem mentions "the value of y increases by the increase of the value of x." That sounds like the function is monotonically increasing. But how do we know it's strictly increasing? Like, if the derivative is always positive, then yes, it's strictly increasing. But if the derivative is zero at some points, then it might not be strictly increasing. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify anything about derivatives. It just says "y increases by the increase of x," which might imply that as x goes up, y goes up, but not necessarily strictly. Maybe it's non-decreasing?

Wait, but the original question is about inverse functions. So if the function is strictly increasing, then it's invertible. But if it's non-decreasing, then it might not be. For example, a constant function is non-decreasing but not invertible. However, the problem states that the graph passes through (0,0) and y increases as x increases. So maybe they mean that it's strictly increasing. 

But how do we confirm that? The given predicates mention things like Origin being on xAxis and yAxis, and those axes are perpendicular. So perhaps the coordinates are standard Cartesian coordinates. The curve passes through (0,0), which is the origin. The question is whether this curve has an inverse function. 

Wait, but the curve isn't specified further. The user mentioned "a curve passes (0,0) and the value of y increases by the increase of the value of x". So maybe it's a function where y is a function of x, such that whenever x increases, y increases. So that would make it a non-decreasing function. But without more info, like whether it's strictly increasing, we can't be sure. 

However, the term "increases by the increase" might suggest that the rate of change is positive, implying that the slope is positive. But again, without knowing if it's strictly increasing, we can't assume. But in typical math problems, when they say something like "y increases as x increases", they usually mean strictly increasing. So if that's the case, then the function is one-to-one, hence invertible. 

But wait, another thought: even if a function is increasing, it could still fail to have an inverse if it's not bijective. But since the domain and codomain aren't specified, maybe we're assuming the usual real numbers. If the function is defined from R to R and is strictly increasing, then it's invertible. But if the curve is, say, a parabola opening upwards, then it's not invertible over all real numbers, but if restricted to x ≥ 0, it would be. 

But the problem doesn't give specifics about the curve beyond passing through (0,0) and increasing y as x increases. Without more constraints, like the equation of the curve, we can't definitively say. However, the question seems to expect us to use the given predicates. Wait, looking back at the given predicates, there's a lot about the origin lying on the x-axis and y-axis, and that the axes are perpendicular. But how does that relate to the curve? 

Ah, maybe the curve is part of a coordinate system where these axes are present. But the main thing is that the curve passes through (0,0) and increases in y as x increases. Since the axes are perpendicular, the coordinate system is standard. But the curve itself is not specified. So perhaps the key is that the curve is a function, i.e., each x maps to one y. Then, if it's strictly increasing, it's invertible. But the problem says "the value of y increases by the increase of the value of x"—maybe that implies that for every increase in x, y increases. Which would mean it's strictly increasing. Therefore, it's one-to-one, thus having an inverse. 

Alternatively, if the curve is not a function, like a relation, then it might not have an inverse. But the question refers to "the graph of a curve", which typically represents a function. Unless it's a multi-valued relation. But given that it's talking about inverse functions, it's likely referring to a function. 

So putting it all together: if the curve is a function that is strictly increasing, then it has an inverse. Hence, the answer would be Yes (A). But wait, let me check again. Suppose the curve is a straight line through the origin with positive slope. Then it's invertible. But if the curve is, say, y = x³, which is strictly increasing, also invertible. However, if the curve is y = x², then it's not strictly increasing everywhere. But the problem says "y increases by the increase of x", which suggests that as x increases, y increases. So for y = x², when x increases past 0, y increases. But for negative x, as x increases towards 0, y decreases. So overall, the function isn't strictly increasing over all real numbers. However, if the domain is restricted to x ≥ 0, then it is. 

But the problem doesn't specify the domain. So maybe the answer depends on whether the function is strictly increasing over its entire domain. Since the question is ambiguous, but given that it's a math problem expecting a definite answer, the intended interpretation is probably that the curve is a function that is strictly increasing, hence invertible. Therefore, the answer would be A. But wait, the options are A: Yes, B: No. 

Wait, but another possibility: if the curve is not a function, like a vertical line, but that wouldn't pass through (0,0) and increase y with x. Or maybe a horizontal line, but that's not increasing. Alternatively, if the curve is a parabola opening upwards, but again, not strictly increasing. 

But the problem states "the value of y increases by the increase of the value of x", which sounds like for any increase in x, y increases. So that would imply that the function is non-decreasing. But if it's non-decreasing, it's not necessarily one-to-one. For example, y = |x| is non-decreasing for x ≥ 0, but not strictly increasing. However, if the curve is strictly increasing, then it's invertible. 

But how can we know if it's strictly increasing? The problem doesn't provide enough information. But given that the answer choices are binary (Yes or No), and the way the question is phrased, it's likely that the expected answer is A: Yes, assuming that the curve is strictly increasing. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is testing knowledge that not all increasing functions are invertible. For instance, if the function is non-decreasing but not strictly increasing, then it's not invertible. But without knowing, we can't assume. 

Hmm. This is tricky. But considering the given predicates involve perpendicular axes, which are standard Cartesian coordinates. The curve passes through (0,0) and increases y as x increases. So if we consider the curve as a function, then for it to have an inverse, it needs to be one-to-one. The fact that y increases as x increases suggests that it's non-decreasing, but not necessarily strictly. However, in many contexts, saying that y increases with x implies that it's strictly increasing. 

Therefore, the answer should be A: Yes.
