====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a circular bridge with a certain water level. Initially, when the water surface is at AB, its width is 8.0 meters, and the arc ACB is a semicircle. Then, when the water rises by 1.0 meter, the new water surface is A'B', and we need to find its width.

First, I need to visualize the setup. There's a circle representing the bridge's cross-section. The original water level AB is a chord of the circle, and since ACB is a semicircle, that means AB is a diameter. Wait, because if the arc ACB is a semicircle, then points A and B are endpoints of a diameter. Therefore, AB must be the diameter of the circle. Given that AB is 8.0 meters, so the radius of the circle would be half of that, which is 4.0 meters. That seems straightforward.

Now, when the water level rises by 1.0 meter, the new chord A'B' is closer to the top of the circle. The question is asking for the length of A'B'. Since the water has risen, the distance from the center of the circle to the new chord A'B' is less than before. 

Let me recall the formula for the length of a chord given the distance from the center. The formula is: length = 2√(r² - d²), where r is the radius and d is the distance from the center to the chord. 

But first, I need to confirm the position of the original chord AB. Since AB is a diameter, the distance from the center O to AB is zero. But when the water rises, the new chord A'B' is higher up, so the distance from O to A'B' increases? Wait, wait. Wait, the water rising would mean the depth of the water decreases, but maybe I need to think about how the vertical distance from the center changes. Let me clarify.

Wait, if the original water level is AB, which is a diameter, so the depth of the water would be the distance from the bottom of the circle to AB. But since AB is a diameter, the depth here would be the radius, 4 meters. However, when the water rises by 1.0 meter, the new water level is A'B', which is 1 meter above the previous level. Wait, but how does that translate into the distance from the center?

Alternatively, perhaps the rise of 1.0 meter refers to the vertical increase in the water level. Let me consider the coordinate system. Let me imagine the circle with center O. Let’s set coordinates such that O is at (0,0). The original chord AB is horizontal, being the diameter. Suppose AB is along the x-axis, stretching from (-4,0) to (4,0), making the length 8.0 meters. The circle has equation x² + y² = r² = 16.

When the water rises by 1.0 meter, the new water level A’B’ is 1.0 meter higher. Wait, but direction matters. If the original water level was at the diameter AB, which is at y=0. Raising the water level by 1.0 meter would move it upward, towards the top of the circle. However, the maximum depth of the circle is the radius. Wait, but if the original depth was 4 meters (from the bottom of the circle to AB?), maybe I need to model this differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the vertical distance from the water surface to the top of the circle. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the water level rising by 1.0 meter means that the distance from the original chord AB to the new chord A’B’ is 1.0 meter. But how is this measured?

Alternatively, considering that when the water level rises, the new chord A’B’ is located 1.0 meter above AB. But since AB was a diameter, moving upwards by 1.0 meter would make the new chord closer to the top of the circle. The distance from the center O to the new chord A’B’ would then be different. Let me formalize this.

Original chord AB is a diameter. Let me assume that the original water level AB is at the bottom of the circle. Wait, but if AB is a diameter, then the circle's center O is the midpoint of AB. So, if AB is horizontal, then O is at the center. Now, when the water rises, the new water level is A’B’, which is a chord parallel to AB but higher up. The vertical distance between AB and A’B’ is 1.0 meter. 

Wait, but how do we relate this vertical distance to the distance from the center? Let me draw a diagram mentally. Let’s suppose the original chord AB is horizontal, passing through the center O. The vertical distance from AB to the top of the circle is the radius, which is 4 meters. When the water rises by 1.0 meter, the new chord A’B’ is 1.0 meter above AB. Therefore, the distance from the center O to A’B’ would be... Well, AB is at the center, so if we go up 1.0 meter from AB, then the distance from O to A’B’ is 1.0 meter? Wait, no. Because AB is already passing through O. Moving up 1.0 meter from AB would take us away from O. Wait, if AB is a diameter, then the center O is exactly halfway between A and B. So if the water level rises by 1.0 meter, meaning that the new chord A’B’ is 1.0 meter higher than AB. So, the vertical distance between AB and A’B’ is 1.0 meter. Thus, the distance from O to A’B’ is 1.0 meter? No. Wait, O is the midpoint of AB. If AB is horizontal, and we move upward by 1.0 meter, then the new chord A’B’ is 1.0 meter above AB, so the distance from O to A’B’ would be 1.0 meter. Wait, but O is on AB. So if AB is horizontal, then moving up 1.0 meter from AB would place A’B’ at a distance of 1.0 meter from AB. Hence, the distance from O to A’B’ is 1.0 meter. 

So, given that, we can use the chord length formula. For the original chord AB, which is a diameter, length is 8.0 m. For the new chord A’B’, the distance from the center O is 1.0 meter. Using the formula for chord length: length = 2√(r² - d²), where r is the radius (4.0 m), and d is the distance from the center to the chord (1.0 m). Plugging in, we get length = 2√(16 - 1) = 2√15 ≈ 7.746 meters. But looking at the answer choices, there's an option B: 2√15. Wait, but let me check my reasoning again.

Wait, hold on. Is the distance from the center to the new chord really 1.0 meter? Let me verify. If AB is the original chord (diameter) lying along the x-axis, centered at O (origin). The new chord A’B’ is 1.0 meter above AB. So, the vertical distance between AB and A’B’ is 1.0 meter. Since AB is the x-axis, the equation of AB is y=0. The new chord A’B’ is at y=1.0. The distance from the center O (which is at (0,0)) to the line y=1.0 is indeed 1.0 meter. Therefore, applying the chord length formula gives us 2√(r² - d²) = 2√(16 - 1) = 2√15. Which would correspond to answer choice B. But wait, the answer options are A: √15, B: 2√15, etc. So B would be the answer. However, let me double-check if my assumption about the distance from the center is correct.

Another way to look at this: When the water rises, the depth of the water decreases. The original depth was from the bottom of the circle to AB. Wait, but if AB is a diameter, then the depth of the water when AB is the surface would actually be the distance from AB to the bottom of the circle. Wait, but the circle's total height is 2r = 8 meters. If AB is a diameter, then the depth of the water is the radius, which is 4 meters. When the water rises by 1.0 meter, the new depth is 4 - 1 = 3 meters. Wait, but this might be another interpretation. Maybe the depth is measured from the top of the circle down to the water surface. So initially, the depth is the radius, and when the water rises, the depth decreases. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says, "when the width of the water surface AB ... is 8.0, the arc ACB is exactly a semicircle." This implies that AB is a diameter. Then, when the water rises 1.0, the new surface A’B’ is inside the circle. The question is about the width of A’B’. 

But the key here is understanding how the rise of 1.0 meter translates into the position of A’B’. If the water rises, the new chord A’B’ is higher up, so the distance from the center to A’B’ is less than the distance to AB. Wait, earlier I thought that the distance from O to AB is zero (since AB is a diameter), but that might not be the case. Wait, no—if AB is a diameter, then the center O lies on AB, so the distance from O to AB is zero. So moving up by 1.0 meter from AB would imply that the new chord is 1.0 meter away from AB, hence the distance from O to A’B’ is 1.0 meter. 

Alternatively, maybe the rise of 1.0 meter refers to the vertical distance from the original water level AB to the new water level A’B’. In that case, since AB is a diameter, the center O is on AB. So if we move up 1.0 meter from AB, the new chord A’B’ is at a distance of 1.0 meter from AB. Therefore, the distance from O to A’B’ is 1.0 meter. 

Therefore, using the chord length formula, the length of A’B’ is 2√(r² - d²) where d = 1.0, r = 4.0. So 2√(16 - 1) = 2√15. So answer B. 

However, there's also a mention of points D and E being midpoints of AB and A’B’ respectively. Also, OD and OE are radii perpendicular to AB and A’B’. Given that, the length of OD is 4.0 meters (radius), and DE is 1.0 meter. Wait, according to the given predicates, LengthOf(Line(D,E),1.0). So DE is 1.0 meter. 

Wait, D is the midpoint of AB. Since AB is 8.0 meters, AD = DB = 4.0 meters. Similarly, E is the midpoint of A’B’. So, if we connect O to D and O to E, these are radii perpendicular to AB and A’B’, respectively. The segment DE connects the midpoints of AB and A’B’, and its length is 1.0 meter. 

This suggests that the vertical distance between AB and A’B’ is 1.0 meter. Because D is the midpoint of AB, and E is the midpoint of A’B’. The line DE is vertical, connecting the two midpoints. Since OD is perpendicular to AB and OE is perpendicular to A’B’, and AB and A’B’ are horizontal chords, then DE is vertical. Therefore, the length of DE is the vertical distance between AB and A’B’, which is 1.0 meter. 

Thus, confirming that the distance from O to A’B’ is 1.0 meter. Therefore, the calculation holds. 

Hence, the length of A’B’ is 2√(16 - 1) = 2√15. Therefore, the answer should be B. 

Wait, but let me check once more. Let me calculate the chord length with d=1.0. The formula is 2√(r² - d²). Here, r=4, d=1. So sqrt(16 -1)=sqrt(15), multiplied by 2 gives 2*sqrt(15). Yes, so answer B. 

But the answer choices are A: sqrt(15), B: 2*sqrt(15), C: 2*sqrt(17), D: cannot compute. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
