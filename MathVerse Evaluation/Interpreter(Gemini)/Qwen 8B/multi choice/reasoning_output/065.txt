MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have some given predicates and need to find the measure of angle 3. Let me start by breaking down the information step by step.

First, the given predicates are:

- Line(a), Line(b), Line(c), Line(d): These are four lines. Also, it's stated that Line(a) is parallel to Line(b). That's important because parallel lines often involve corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc.

- Angles 1, 2, 3, 4 are mentioned. We know that MeasureOf(Angle(4)) is 30.0 degrees, and Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(4)), 30.0). So Angle 4 is definitely 30 degrees. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(2))), so angles 1 and 2 are equal in measure. 

The question asks for angle 3. The options are A:120°, B:130°, C:145°, D:150°. 

Now, I need to visualize the figure. Since there are four lines and four angles, maybe they form a transversal setup? Or perhaps a triangle with intersecting lines? Wait, but without seeing the actual figure, I have to infer based on standard configurations.

Given that Line(a) is parallel to Line(b), and there are other lines (c and d) involved. Maybe lines c and d are transversals cutting across the parallel lines a and b? Let me think about typical scenarios where such angles would appear.

Let me consider that angles 1 and 2 could be alternate interior angles or corresponding angles due to the parallel lines. But since angles 1 and 2 are equal, that suggests they might be either corresponding or alternate interior angles. However, if those lines are cut by a transversal, then those angles would be equal. 

But there's also angle 4, which is 30 degrees. How does angle 4 fit in? Maybe angle 4 is part of a triangle or another configuration involving the parallel lines. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle formed by lines a, c, and d?

Wait, another thought: if there are two parallel lines cut by two transversals, creating several angles. Suppose lines c and d are transversals crossing lines a and b. In such cases, various angle relationships come into play. For example, consecutive interior angles are supplementary, and same-side exterior angles are also supplementary. 

Alternatively, maybe the diagram involves a triangle where one angle is 30 degrees, and others relate to angles 1 and 2. But how do angles 1, 2, 3, 4 connect here?

Another possibility: since there are four angles labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, perhaps they are around a point or forming a polygon. Wait, but angles around a point sum up to 360 degrees. However, if they're in a triangle, the sum would be 180. But with four angles, maybe they are part of a quadrilateral? Hmm.

Wait, the presence of four lines (a, b, c, d) might suggest that they form a trapezoid or some other quadrilateral. Given that a and b are parallel, maybe lines c and d are the legs of the trapezoid? But then again, depending on how they cross.

Alternatively, maybe the lines form a star shape with intersecting lines. However, without the exact figure, it's challenging, but let's try to proceed with common setups.

Assuming that lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d are transversals. Suppose that line c intersects line a at angle 1 and line b at angle 2. Similarly, line d intersects line a at angle 4 and line b at angle 3. Wait, but then angles 1 and 2 could be corresponding or alternate interior angles, hence equal. And angles 4 and 3 could be same-side interior angles, making them supplementary. 

Wait, if that's the case, then angle 4 is 30 degrees. If angle 4 and angle 3 are same-side interior angles, then they add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle 3 would be 180 - 30 = 150 degrees. Which is option D. But wait, let me check if that aligns with the given info.

But first, let me confirm if that scenario fits the given predicates. If lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d are transversals. Suppose line c creates angle 1 with line a, and line d creates angle 4 with line a. Then, angle 2 would be the corresponding angle on line b with line c, making it equal to angle 1. Then, angle 3 would be the corresponding angle on line b with line d, which could be supplementary to angle 4 if they are same-side interior angles. 

So, angle 4 + angle 3 = 180°, so angle 3 = 150°, which is option D. But wait, why would angle 4 and angle 3 be supplementary? Because if lines c and d are transversals cutting the parallel lines a and b, then angle 4 (on line a) and angle 3 (on line b) would be same-side interior angles if lines c and d are the same transversal? No, unless lines c and d are arranged in a certain way.

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is an alternate interior angle with angle 3? But that would make them equal. But angle 4 is 30°, so angle 3 would be 30°, which isn't among the options. So that's probably not.

Wait, perhaps angle 4 is an exterior angle. If lines c and d are intersecting, creating vertical angles or something else. Another possibility: suppose lines a and b are horizontal, with line c being a transversal creating angles 1 and 2 (which are equal), and line d being another transversal creating angle 4 (30°) and angle 3. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky. However, the fact that angle 1 equals angle 2 suggests that they are either corresponding or alternate interior angles. So if lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d are transversals, then angles 1 and 2 being equal implies that lines c and d might be parallel too? Not necessarily. Wait, if line c is a transversal, then angles 1 and 2 would be corresponding or alternate. But if there's another line d, perhaps creating angle 4 and 3.

Alternatively, considering that angle 4 is 30°, which is given. Let's assume that angle 4 is adjacent to angle 3, forming a linear pair. Then angle 3 would be 180 - 30 = 150°, which is option D. But how would that happen?

Maybe angle 4 and angle 3 are supplementary because they are on a straight line. For instance, if line d intersects line b at angle 4 and angle 3. Wait, if line d crosses line b, then angle 4 and angle 3 could be adjacent angles forming a straight line, thus adding up to 180°. Hence, angle 3 would be 150°, which is D.

But how do angles 1 and 2 factor into this? Well, if angles 1 and 2 are equal, maybe they are vertical angles or part of another relationship. For example, if line c is a transversal creating angles 1 and 2 with lines a and b, then since a and b are parallel, those angles could be equal. So if angle 1 is equal to angle 2, that's consistent with the parallel lines. But how does that affect angle 3?

Perhaps angle 3 is related to angle 1 via some triangle. Like, if lines a, c, and d form a triangle, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle formed with angles 1, 2, and 4, but that seems unclear.

Wait, another approach: since angle 1 equals angle 2, and angle 4 is 30°, perhaps these angles are parts of a larger triangle or quadrilateral. For example, if there's a triangle where two angles are equal (angles 1 and 2), and angle 4 is part of another triangle. But again, without the figure, this is speculative.

But considering that angle 4 is 30°, and if angle 3 is supplementary to it, leading to 150°, which is option D, that seems plausible. Especially since 150° is a common supplement of 30°, and the answer options include D:150°.

But let me verify once more. If lines a and b are parallel, and line d is a transversal that forms angle 4 with line a (30°), then the corresponding angle on line b would be 30°, but that's not angle 3. However, if line d is a transversal that creates an angle with line b that's supplementary to angle 4, then angle 3 would be 150°. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 4 is an alternate exterior angle with angle 3. Wait, if lines a and b are parallel, and line d is a transversal, then alternate exterior angles would be equal. But angle 4 is 30°, so angle 3 would be 30°, which doesn't fit. 

Wait, but maybe angle 4 is a same-side exterior angle with angle 3. Then they would be supplementary. So 30° + angle 3 = 180°, giving angle 3 = 150°, which is option D. This seems likely. 

Therefore, putting it all together: since lines a and b are parallel, and line d is a transversal creating angle 4 (30°) on one side, and angle 3 on the other side (same-side exterior angles), they add up to 180°, making angle 3 150°. 

Additionally, angles 1 and 2 being equal supports the idea that lines c and/or d are acting as transversals with the parallel lines, creating equal angles. 

Thus, the answer should be D:150°.
