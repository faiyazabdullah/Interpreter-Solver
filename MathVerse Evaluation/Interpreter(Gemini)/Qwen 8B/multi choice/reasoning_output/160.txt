MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right triangle ABC where angle C is 90 degrees. The hypotenuse AB is 10 units long, and side AC is 8 units. We need to find the value of tan B. 

First, I should recall what tangent means in a right triangle. Tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent. So, for angle B, the opposite side would be AC, and the adjacent side would be BC. Wait, but wait—let me make sure. In triangle ABC, angle B is at point B. Let me visualize the triangle. Since angle C is the right angle, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. 

So, angle B is one of the acute angles. To find tan B, I need the length of the side opposite to angle B divided by the length of the side adjacent to angle B. The side opposite angle B is AC, which is given as 8 units. The side adjacent to angle B is BC, which we don't know yet. But we do know the hypotenuse AB is 10 units. 

Wait, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem here. Since it's a right triangle, the sum of squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. So, AC² + BC² = AB². Plugging in the known values: 8² + BC² = 10². That gives 64 + BC² = 100. Subtracting 64 from both sides, BC² = 36, so BC = 6. 

Now, with BC being 6 units, we can compute tan B. As mentioned earlier, tan B is opposite over adjacent. Opposite to angle B is AC (8) and adjacent is BC (6). Therefore, tan B = 8/6, which simplifies to 4/3. Wait, but looking at the answer choices, D is 4/3. However, let me double-check because sometimes I mix up the opposite and adjacent sides. 

Wait another thought: Maybe I got the opposite and adjacent mixed. Let me confirm. In triangle ABC, angle B is at vertex B. The sides relative to angle B are: the opposite side is AC, since angle B is at B, so the side opposite is AC. The adjacent side is BC, which connects to B. Yes, that seems right. So tan B = AC / BC = 8 / 6 = 4/3. 

But wait, the answer options include D as 4/3. But let me check again. Alternatively, could there be a mistake in identifying the sides? For example, if angle B is at B, then the hypotenuse is AB. The sides adjacent to angle B are BC and the hypotenuse. Wait, no—the adjacent side is the one forming the angle. So angle B is formed by sides AB and BC. So the two legs adjacent to angle B would be BC and the other leg. Wait, no, in terms of tangent, for angle B, the opposite side is AC, and adjacent is BC. Because angle B is at vertex B, so the sides connected to B are AB and BC. The side opposite angle B is AC. So yes, tan B = opposite (AC)/adjacent (BC) = 8/6 = 4/3. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating BC. Let me recheck. Given AB=10, AC=8. Then BC^2 = AB^2 - AC^2 = 100 - 64 = 36. So BC=6. Correct. Then tan B is 8/6 = 4/3. So the answer should be D. But wait, looking back at the answer choices, D is 4/3. So that's the answer. 

But wait, hold on. Another way to think about it: Sometimes people confuse sine and cosine. Let me verify using trigonometric ratios. For angle B, sin B = opposite/hypotenuse = AC / AB = 8/10 = 4/5. Cos B = adjacent/hypotenuse = BC / AB = 6/10 = 3/5. Then tan B = sin B / cos B = (4/5)/(3/5) = 4/3. Yep, same result. So that confirms it. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
