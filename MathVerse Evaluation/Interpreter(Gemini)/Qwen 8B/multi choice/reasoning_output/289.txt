MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle PQR, and points S and T such that ST is parallel to RQ. Also, triangle PST is similar to triangle PRQ, sharing vertex P. Given PS = 12.5, SR = 5, PT = 15, and need to find TQ. 

First, I should recall that similar triangles have corresponding sides in proportion. Since the similarity is between triangle PST and PRQ, their sides should be proportional. Let me note down the given lengths: PS is 12.5, SR is 5. Wait, SR is part of PR? Because if S is on PR, since ST is parallel to RQ, maybe S lies on PR? Wait, the problem says PointLiesOnLine(S, Line(P,R)) so yes, S is on PR. Similarly, T is on PQ because PointLiesOnLine(T, Line(P,Q)). 

So, let's visualize triangle PQR with point S on PR and T on PQ. Then ST is parallel to RQ. And triangles PST ~ PRQ. 

Since they're similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides should be equal. Let me think about the correspondence. The similarity is written as Triangle(P,S,T) ~ Triangle(P,R,Q). So the order matters here. That means angle at P corresponds to angle at P, angle at S corresponds to angle at R, and angle at T corresponds to angle at Q. 

Therefore, the sides opposite these angles would correspond. For example, side PS in triangle PST corresponds to side PR in triangle PRQ. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle PST, the sides are PS, ST, PT. In triangle PRQ, the sides are PR, RQ, PQ. But the similarity is PST ~ PRQ, so the correspondence is P -> P, S -> R, T -> Q. Therefore, the sides PS corresponds to PR, ST corresponds to RQ, and PT corresponds to PQ. 

Wait, but how does that work? Let me write the ratios. The ratio of similarity would be PS / PR = PT / PQ = ST / RQ. 

But we know PS is 12.5, and SR is 5. Since S is on PR, PR is PS + SR = 12.5 + 5 = 17.5. Which matches the given Add(LengthOf(Line(P,S)), LengthOf(Line(S,R)), LengthOf(Line(P,R))) equals 17.5. So PR is 17.5. 

Also, PT is given as 15. We need to find TQ. Since T is on PQ, perhaps we can find PQ first? Or use the similarity ratio. 

Let me think. From the similarity ratio, since PS / PR = PT / PQ. So substituting known values: 12.5 / 17.5 = 15 / PQ. Solving for PQ: cross multiply, 12.5 * PQ = 17.5 * 15. So PQ = (17.5 * 15)/12.5. Simplify: 17.5 divided by 12.5 is 1.4, so 1.4 * 15 = 21. Therefore, PQ is 21. 

Then, since T is on PQ, PT is 15, so TQ = PQ - PT = 21 - 15 = 6. So the answer would be B:6. 

Wait, but let me confirm. Another way: the ratio of similarity is 12.5 / 17.5 = 5/7. So the ratio of PT/PQ should also be 5/7. Since PT is 15, then 15 / PQ = 5/7 â†’ PQ = 15 * 7 /5 = 21. Hence, TQ = 21 -15=6. Yes, same result. 

Alternatively, check if other ratios hold. Like ST/RQ should be same as 5/7. But do we know ST or RQ? Well, since ST is parallel to RQ, by Thales' theorem, the ratio of PS/PR = PT/PQ = ST/RQ. But maybe we don't need that here. 

Another thing to check: Are there other relations? For instance, since ST || RQ, then triangle PST ~ triangle PRQ by AA similarity (since they share angle at P, and the sides around it are proportional). So the similarity ratio is indeed 12.5/17.5 = 5/7. Thus, PT/PQ = 5/7. Therefore, PQ = 21, leading to TQ = 6. 

Yes, seems solid. So the answer should be B.
