MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a parallelogram JKLM with diagonals JL and KM intersecting at point R. We need to find the measure of angle KJL, which is angle at point J between points K and L. 

First, I'll recall some properties of parallelograms. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel. Also, the diagonals bisect each other. That means the point where they intersect, R, should be the midpoint of both diagonals. Given that, the diagonals split each other into two equal parts. 

Looking at the given predicates, there's a lot here. Let me parse them one by one. 

We know that ML is 45 units long. Since it's a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal. So KL should also be 45? Wait, wait, no. Wait, ML is one side. Wait, the sides of the parallelogram would be JK, KL, LM, and MJ. Wait, but the problem says ML is 45. So ML is one of the sides. But since it's a parallelogram, ML equals JK, and KL equals JM. Wait, maybe I should draw a rough sketch mentally.

Let me note down the given lengths. LengthOf(Line(M,L)) is 45, so ML=45. Then LengthOf(Line(K,L)) is 21, so KL=21. Also, there's LengthOf(Line(J,K)) = Add(Mul(2,b),3). And LengthOf(Line(J,M)) = Mul(3,a). Also, there are some equations like Equals(Mul(2,b),Sub(45,3)). Let me check that. Oh, yes, that equation gives us that 2b = 45 - 3 = 42, so b = 21. Similarly, Equals(Mul(3,a),21) implies that 3a=21, so a=7. Therefore, we can compute the lengths of JK and JM once we find a and b. 

But first, let's focus on the angles. The MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) is 30 degrees, and MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70 degrees. Also, there are several other angle measures mentioned. For example, MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is Add(30,70)=100 degrees, and that's equal to 100 degrees. Also, there are statements about angles being equal, such as MeasureOf(Angle(J,M,L)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)), and others. 

Wait, the question asks for m∠KJL. So angle at J between K and L. Let me visualize the parallelogram. Points J, K, L, M. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if I can figure out the angles at the vertices, perhaps I can find the desired angle. 

Alternatively, since we have some angle measures given, maybe we can use triangle properties. For instance, considering triangle JKL. Wait, but in a parallelogram, the sum of angles at each vertex is 180 degrees. Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if angle at K is 70 degrees, then angle at L would be 110 degrees? Wait, but I need to get more precise.

Wait, the given MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is 100 degrees. Let's think about that. Point K, L, M. So angle at L between K and M. Which is angle KLM. In the parallelogram, since opposite sides are parallel, angle KLM should be equal to angle JKM? Or maybe not. Wait, in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle at L and angle at K are supplementary. Wait, but angle KLM is part of that?

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So point R is the midpoint of both diagonals. Also, since diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent. 

But how does that relate to the angles? Maybe looking at triangle JKL. Wait, but I need to find angle at J, which is ∠KJL. Let me consider triangle JKL. If I can find the lengths of sides JK, KL, and JL, maybe I can use the Law of Cosines. Alternatively, since we know some angles, perhaps using the Law of Sines. 

Wait, but first, let's confirm the length of sides. From the given, ML=45, which is one of the sides. Since ML is equal to JK (opposite sides of parallelogram), so JK=ML=45. Wait, but according to the given, LengthOf(Line(J,K)) is Add(Mul(2,b),3). Earlier, we found that 2b=42, so that expression becomes 42+3=45. So that checks out. So JK=45, which matches ML=45. Then KL=21, which is given as LengthOf(Line(K,L))=21. Since KL is another side of the parallelogram, which should be equal to JM. So JM=KL=21. Also, LengthOf(Line(J,M)) is Mul(3,a). Since a=7, then JM=3*7=21, which matches. So that's consistent. 

Now, the sides of the parallelogram are JK=45, KL=21, LM=45, and MJ=21. Now, the diagonals are JL and KM. Their intersection is R, the midpoint. 

So, in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. So JR = RL, and KR = RM. Also, the diagonals divide the parallelogram into four triangles. For example, triangle JKR and triangle LMR are congruent, etc. 

Now, the angles given: MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) is 30°, which is angle at L between points M, L, K. So that's angle KLM. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70°, which is angle at L between K, L, J. Wait, angle K-L-J. So that's angle at L between K and J. Wait, but in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So angle at L plus angle at K should be 180°. But angle KLM is 30°, and angle K-L-J is 70°, adding up to 100°, which doesn't seem to fit. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting the angle labels. 

Wait, angle KLM is at point L, between points K, L, M. So that's angle KLM. Angle K-L-J is angle at L between K, L, J. Wait, but in the parallelogram, the angles at each vertex are determined by the sides. So if angle KLM is 30°, then angle at L between K and M is 30°, and angle at L between K and J would be something else. Wait, but maybe those angles are part of different triangles. 

Alternatively, perhaps using triangle KLM. Wait, but in the parallelogram, points K, L, M are connected. Wait, KL is 21, LM is 45, and KM is a diagonal. Wait, but we don't know the length of KM yet. However, since we have the coordinates of the points, maybe we can use coordinates to find angles. 

Alternatively, since we have some angle measures, maybe using triangle properties. For example, angle KLM is 30°, and angle at L between K and J is 70°, but how do these relate? 

Wait, the given MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is 100°, which was calculated as Add(30,70). So angle at L between K and M is 30°, and angle at L between K and J is 70°, but how does that make sense? Because in the parallelogram, the angles at point L would be adjacent to sides KL and LM. Wait, but in reality, the angles at point L in the parallelogram would be angle KLM and angle JLK? Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the structure of the parallelogram. 

Let me try labeling the parallelogram properly. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are parallel. So JK || LM and KL || JM. So if I imagine points J, K, L, M arranged such that JK and LM are opposite sides, and KL and JM are opposite sides. So connecting J-K-L-M-J forms the parallelogram. 

Therefore, at point L, the sides are KL and LM. So angle at L is between KL and LM, which is angle KLM. Wait, but earlier, there's a mention of MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) = 100°, which is angle at L between K, L, M. So that's angle KLM = 100°, but earlier it was stated that MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) is 30°, which seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps there was a mistake in parsing the angle measures. 

Wait, the given MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) is 30°, which is angle at L between M, L, K. So that's angle KLM, which is supposed to be 30°, but earlier there's another statement that MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is Add(30,70)=100°, which may refer to another angle. This suggests confusion in the angle labels. 

Wait, let me re-examine the given predicates. There's MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30°, which is angle at L between M, L, K. So that's angle KLM = 30°. Then MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70°, which is angle at L between K, L, J. So that's angle J L K. Wait, but in the parallelogram, at point L, the adjacent angles are angle KLM and angle J L K. Wait, but those two angles should add up to 180° because they are consecutive angles in the parallelogram. So angle KLM (at L between K and M) plus angle J L K (at L between J and K) should be 180°. But according to the given, angle KLM is 30°, and angle J L K is 70°, totaling 100°, which contradicts. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation. 

Ah! Wait, maybe the angle MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is not at point L, but at point J? No, the notation Angle(K,L,J) refers to the angle at point L between points K, L, J. Wait, no, standard notation is Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X-Y-Z. So Angle(K,L,J) is the angle at L between K and J. So that's angle J L K. So that's the same as before. So if angle KLM is 30°, and angle J L K is 70°, their sum is 100°, which shouldn't be. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, my understanding must be wrong. 

Wait, but there's another predicate stating that MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is Add(30,70)=100°, which is angle at L between K, L, M. Wait, but that's the same as angle KLM, which was previously said to be 30°. So there's inconsistency here. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the angles. 

Wait, perhaps the MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) refers to angle at M between K, L, M. Wait, no, the angle notation is Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y. So Angle(K,L,M) is angle at L between K and M. So that's angle KLM, which was given as 30°, but another predicate says that MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is 100°, which conflicts. This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the given data. 

Wait, looking back at the given predicates: 

"MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K),30)" – this is angle at L between M, L, K → angle KLM = 30°.

Then, "MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J),70)" – angle at L between K, L, J → angle J L K = 70°.

But then, later there's "MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M),Add(30,70))" which is angle at L between K, L, M → angle KLM again. But that's already given as 30°, so why is it added to 70? This seems contradictory unless there's a typo. However, the problem states that these are given predicates, so perhaps there's a misunderstanding. 

Alternatively, maybe the Angle(K,L,M) refers to angle at M? No, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(K,L,M) is at L. 

This inconsistency suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, but assuming that the given predicates are correct, I need to reconcile this. 

Wait, perhaps the MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is referring to angle at M? Let me check. If it were angle at M between K, L, M, that would be angle K M L. But that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem's predicates. But since I have to work with the given data, perhaps I need to proceed carefully. 

Another possibility: the angle MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is actually referring to a different angle. Wait, maybe it's angle at M between K, L, M? No, that would require three points where the middle is the vertex. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle is at point K between L, K, M. Wait, but that would be Angle(L,K,M), which is angle at K between L and M. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Perhaps I need to look elsewhere. 

Given that there's a conflict in the angle measures, maybe I should focus on other aspects. Let's consider the angles around point R, where the diagonals intersect. In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, and they form vertical angles. Also, the diagonals divide the parallelogram into triangles. 

Since diagonals bisect each other, the triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent. For example, triangle JRL and triangle KRM are congruent. Also, the diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, so the segments JR = RL and KR = RM. 

Also, given that R is the midpoint of both diagonals, and since ML=45, then JL is a diagonal whose midpoint is R. So JR = RL = half of JL. Similarly, KM is another diagonal, with KR = RM = half of KM. 

Additionally, the problem mentions that IsMidpointOf(Point(R),Line(J,L)) and IsMidpointOf(Point(R),Line(K,M)), confirming that R is the midpoint of both diagonals. 

Now, the question is to find m∠KJL, which is the angle at point J between points K and L. Let's denote this angle as ∠KJL. To find this angle, perhaps we can use the Law of Cosines in triangle JKL, if we know the lengths of the sides. 

In triangle JKL, we have sides JK=45, KL=21, and JL. If we can find JL, then we can apply the Law of Cosines. 

To find JL, we can use the formula for the length of a diagonal in a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. The formula is:

JL² + KM² = 2*(JK² + KL²)

But we need to find either JL or KM. However, we might not have enough information directly. Alternatively, since we have some angles, perhaps we can find the lengths using the Law of Cosines in triangle KLM or other triangles. 

Wait, let's consider triangle KLM. We know KL=21, LM=45, and angle at L is angle KLM = 30° (from MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K))=30). So applying the Law of Cosines on triangle KLM:

KM² = KL² + LM² - 2*KL*LM*cos(angle KLM)

Plugging in the numbers:

KM² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)

Calculate that:

21² = 441

45² = 2025

Sum is 441 + 2025 = 2466

Then subtract 2*21*45*cos(30°). Let's calculate cos(30°) = √3/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So 2*21*45 = 1890

Multiply by cos(30): 1890*(√3)/2 ≈ 1890 * 0.8660 ≈ 1635.74

Thus, KM² ≈ 2466 - 1635.74 ≈ 830.26

Therefore, KM ≈ sqrt(830.26) ≈ 28.81 units.

But wait, this gives us KM. Now, since we have KM, and knowing that in a parallelogram, the diagonals satisfy the relation:

JL² + KM² = 2*(JK² + KL²)

So substituting:

JL² + KM² = 2*(45² + 21²) = 2*(2025 + 441) = 2*2466 = 4932

So JL² = 4932 - KM² ≈ 4932 - 830.26 ≈ 4101.74

Thus, JL ≈ sqrt(4101.74) ≈ 64.05 units.

Now, having JL, we can go back to triangle JKL, where sides are JK=45, KL=21, and JL≈64.05. Using the Law of Cosines to find angle at J (∠KJL):

cos(angle KJL) = (JK² + JL² - KL²)/(2*JK*JL)

Wait, no. Law of Cosines states that for triangle ABC, c² = a² + b² - 2ab*cos(C). So rearranged, cos(C) = (a² + b² - c²)/(2ab).

Here, angle at J is between sides JK and JL. Wait, no. In triangle JKL, angle at J is between sides JK and JL? Wait, points J, K, L. So sides are JK, JL, and KL. Wait, angle at J is between sides JK and JL? No, in triangle JKL, the angle at J is between sides JK and JL? Wait, no. Let me clarify:

In triangle JKL, the vertices are J, K, L. So the sides are:

- JK: connects J to K

- KL: connects K to L

- LJ: connects L to J

So angle at J is between sides JK and JL. Wait, JL is from J to L. So yes, in triangle JKL, angle at J is between sides JK and JL. So applying Law of Cosines:

KL² = JK² + JL² - 2*JK*JL*cos(angle KJL)

Rearranging for cos(angle KJL):

cos(angle KJL) = (JK² + JL² - KL²)/(2*JK*JL)

Plugging in the values:

JK=45, KL=21, JL≈sqrt(4101.74) ≈ 64.05

Compute numerator: 45² + 64.05² - 21²

Which is 2025 + (approx 4101.74) - 441 = 2025 + 4101.74 = 6126.74 - 441 = 5685.74

Denominator: 2*45*64.05 ≈ 2*45*64.05 = 90*64.05 ≈ 5764.5

So cos(angle KJL) ≈ 5685.74 / 5764.5 ≈ 0.9896

Taking arccos(0.9896) ≈ 7.5 degrees? Wait, that seems very small. But that conflicts with the given angle measures. 

Wait, but this suggests that angle KJL is approximately 7.5 degrees, which isn't among the answer choices. Clearly, there's a mistake here. 

But wait, maybe my calculation of KM was incorrect. Let me double-check. 

Earlier, I computed KM using Law of Cosines in triangle KLM. Given KL=21, LM=45, angle at L is 30°, so:

KM² = 21² + 45² - 2*21*45*cos(30°)

Yes, that's correct. Let's compute this precisely without approximating. 

First, compute 21² = 441, 45² = 2025. Sum is 441 + 2025 = 2466.

Next term: 2*21*45 = 1890. Multiply by cos(30°): 1890*(√3)/2 = 945√3.

So KM² = 2466 - 945√3.

Let me compute the numerical value:

√3 ≈ 1.732, so 945*1.732 ≈ 945*1.732. Let's calculate:

945 * 1.732 = ?

Well, 900*1.732 = 1558.8, and 45*1.732 = 77.94. Total ≈ 1558.8 + 77.94 = 1636.74

So KM² ≈ 2466 - 1636.74 = 829.26

Thus, KM ≈ sqrt(829.26) ≈ 28.8 units.

Then, JL² = 2*(45² + 21²) - KM² = 2*(2025 + 441) - 829.26 = 2*2466 - 829.26 = 4932 - 829.26 = 4102.74

So JL ≈ sqrt(4102.74) ≈ 64.05 units.

Now, plugging into the Law of Cosines for triangle JKL:

cos(angle KJL) = (45² + 64.05² - 21²) / (2*45*64.05)

Wait, but earlier I had:

Numerator = 45² + JL² - KL² = 2025 + 4102.74 - 441 = 2025 + 4102.74 = 6127.74 - 441 = 5686.74

Denominator = 2*45*64.05 ≈ 2*45*64.05 = 90*64.05 = 5764.5

So cos(angle KJL) ≈ 5686.74 / 5764.5 ≈ 0.9896, leading to angle ≈ 7.5 degrees. This doesn't align with any of the answer choices, suggesting a mistake in the approach. 

But the answer options are A:30, B:70, C:80, D:100. So 7.5 is not there. Where is the error?

Alternative approach: Perhaps I misapplied the Law of Cosines. Let me recheck. 

In triangle JKL, angle at J is between sides JK and JL. Wait, but in reality, in the parallelogram, point L is connected to J via JL, and point K is connected to J via JK. So triangle JKL has sides JK=45, KL=21, and JL. Wait, but JL is a diagonal, not sure if it's directly part of the triangle. Wait, in the parallelogram, JL is a diagonal connecting J to L, so in triangle JKL, the sides are JK, KL, and JL. Yes. 

But if angle KJL is the angle at J between sides JK and JL, then using Law of Cosines:

KL² = JK² + JL² - 2*JK*JL*cos(angle KJL)

So solving for cos(angle KJL):

cos(angle KJL) = (JK² + JL² - KL²) / (2*JK*JL)

But with the values plugged in, this gives a very small angle, which contradicts the given angle measures. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculating JL. Let me verify the formula for the diagonals in a parallelogram. The correct formula is:

For a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides:

JL² + KM² = 2*(JK² + KL²)

Yes, that's correct. So with JL² = 2*(JK² + KL²) - KM².

But earlier, I used this formula correctly. So if KM² = 2466 - 945√3, then JL² = 2*(45² + 21²) - (2466 - 945√3) = 2*2466 - 2466 + 945√3 = 2466 + 945√3.

Wait, hold on! Earlier, I thought that KM² = 2466 - 945√3, so JL² = 2*(45² + 21²) - KM² = 2*2466 - KM² = 4932 - KM². But KM² is 2466 - 945√3. So JL² = 4932 - (2466 - 945√3) = 4932 - 2466 + 945√3 = 2466 + 945√3. 

Oh! Here's the mistake! Previously, I incorrectly calculated JL² as 2*2466 - KM², but KM² is 2466 - 945√3. So JL² = 2*2466 - (2466 - 945√3) = 2466 + 945√3. So JL² = 2466 + 945√3. Thus, JL = sqrt(2466 + 945√3). 

That changes everything! My previous calculation of JL was wrong because I subtracted KM² instead of adding. So now, let's recalculate.

Let me compute JL² = 2466 + 945√3.

Now, compute the numerical value:

First, compute 945√3 ≈ 945 * 1.732 ≈ 1636.74

So JL² ≈ 2466 + 1636.74 = 4102.74, which matches my earlier calculation of JL ≈ 64.05. Wait, but that's the same as before. Wait, but why did I get the same JL value? Because 2466 + 945√3 = 2466 + 945*1.732 ≈ 2466 + 1636.74 = 4102.74. So JL ≈ sqrt(4102.74) ≈ 64.05. 

So even though I corrected the formula, the numerical value remains the same. So why is the angle still giving a strange result? 

Perhaps the issue lies elsewhere. Let me think differently. 

Maybe the angle measures given in the problem can help. For instance, there's MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) = 100°, which is angle at L between K, L, M. Which is angle KLM = 100°, but earlier it was given as 30°. This discrepancy suggests that perhaps there's an error in the problem's predicates, but since I have to proceed, maybe I need to use the given angle measures. 

Wait, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) is Add(30,70)=100°, which may imply that angle KLM is 100°, but earlier it was said to be 30°. This contradiction indicates that perhaps the initial assumption about the angle labels is incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) is 30°, which is angle at L between M, L, K, i.e., angle KLM = 30°, and MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70°, which is angle at L between K, L, J, i.e., angle JKL = 70°. Wait, but in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So angle at L (which is angle KLM + angle JKL?) No, in a parallelogram, each pair of adjacent angles are supplementary. At point L, the angles are angle KLM and angle JLM, which should add up to 180°. Wait, but if angle KLM is 30°, then angle JLM should be 150°. But the given MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70°, which is angle at L between K, L, J, which would be angle JKL, not angle at L. 

This confusion suggests that perhaps the angles given are not at the same point. Let me try to re-express the given angle measures:

- MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30°: angle at L between M, L, K → angle KLM = 30°.

- MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70°: angle at L between K, L, J → angle JKL = 70°.

But in a parallelogram, angle KLM and angle JKL are adjacent angles at point L and point K, respectively. Wait, no. In a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. At point L, the angles would be angle KLM (between K, L, M) and angle JLM (between J, L, M). These two angles at point L should add up to 180°. But if angle KLM is 30°, then angle JLM would be 150°. But the given MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70°, which is angle at L between K, L, J, which is angle JKL. Wait, no, angle at L between K, L, J is angle JKL, but that's at point K. Wait, no, angle at L between K, L, J is angle at L between K and J, which is angle J L K. 

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me try to think differently. 

Since we know the sides of the parallelogram, and the angle measures, perhaps using vector methods or coordinate geometry could help. 

Let me place the parallelogram on a coordinate system. Let's assume point L is at the origin (0,0). Since ML=45 and KL=21, and angle at L between ML and KL is 30°, let's assign coordinates accordingly. 

Assume point L is at (0,0). Let's take ML along the x-axis. So point M is at (45,0), since ML=45. Now, angle at L between ML and KL is 30°, so KL makes a 30° angle with ML. Since KL=21, we can find coordinates of point K. 

From point L (0,0), moving at 30° from ML (which is along positive x-axis), so direction of KL is 30° above the x-axis. So coordinates of K would be KL * cos(theta) and KL * sin(theta). Theta is 30°, so:

K_x = 21 * cos(30°) = 21*(√3/2) ≈ 21*0.8660 ≈ 18.186

K_y = 21 * sin(30°) = 21*0.5 = 10.5

So point K is at (18.186, 10.5). 

Now, since it's a parallelogram, vector LM equals vector JK. Vector LM is from L(0,0) to M(45,0), which is (45,0). So vector JK should also be (45,0). Point J is such that vector JK = LM. 

Vector JK = K - J = (45,0). So if K is at (18.186, 10.5), then J = K - vector JK = K - (45,0) = (18.186 - 45, 10.5 - 0) = (-26.814, 10.5). 

So point J is at (-26.814, 10.5). 

Now, we can find coordinates of all points:

- L: (0,0)

- M: (45,0)

- K: (18.186, 10.5)

- J: (-26.814, 10.5)

Now, we need to find angle KJL, which is the angle at point J between points K and L. 

So vectors from J to K and from J to L. 

Vector JK is K - J = (18.186 - (-26.814), 10.5 - 10.5) = (45, 0). 

Vector JL is L - J = (0 - (-26.814), 0 - 10.5) = (26.814, -10.5)

Now, angle between vectors JK and JL at point J is the angle between vector JK (45,0) and vector JL (26.814, -10.5). 

To find this angle, use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (JK • JL) / (|JK| |JL|)

First, compute the dot product:

JK • JL = (45)(26.814) + (0)(-10.5) = 45 * 26.814

Calculate 45 * 26.814: 26.814 * 45. Let's compute:

26 * 45 = 1170

0.814 * 45 = 36.63

Total ≈ 1170 + 36.63 = 1206.63

Now, |JK| is the magnitude of vector JK, which is 45 (since it's the length of JK, given as 45).

|JL| is the magnitude of vector JL, which is sqrt(26.814² + (-10.5)^2).

Calculate 26.814²: approximately (26.814)^2 ≈ 719 (since 26^2=676, 27^2=729; 26.814 is close to 26.8, which squared is ~718.24).

10.5² = 110.25

So total |JL| ≈ sqrt(719 + 110.25) = sqrt(829.25) ≈ 28.8 units, which matches our previous calculation of KM. 

So cos(theta) = 1206.63 / (45 * 28.8) ≈ 1206.63 / 1296 ≈ 0.931

Now, theta = arccos(0.931) ≈ 21.3 degrees. Still not matching any of the answer choices. This suggests a mistake in assumptions. 

Wait, but according to the problem, there's a MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70°, which in this coordinate system, what is that angle? 

Angle at L between K, L, J. Point L is at (0,0), so vectors from L to K and from L to J. 

Vector LK is K - L = (18.186, 10.5)

Vector LJ is J - L = (-26.814, 10.5)

The angle between these vectors is MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70°, as given. Let's verify this. 

Compute the angle between vectors LK and LJ. 

Dot product: LK • LJ = (18.186)(-26.814) + (10.5)(10.5) 

Calculate:

First term: 18.186 * -26.814 ≈ -18.186 * 26.814. Let's approximate:

18 * 26.814 ≈ 482.65

0.186 * 26.814 ≈ 4.98

Total ≈ -482.65 - 4.98 ≈ -487.63

Second term: 10.5 * 10.5 = 110.25

Total dot product ≈ -487.63 + 110.25 = -377.38

Magnitude of LK is sqrt(18.186² + 10.5²) ≈ sqrt(330.7 + 110.25) = sqrt(440.95) ≈ 21.0, which matches KL=21.

Magnitude of LJ is sqrt((-26.814)^2 + 10.5^2) ≈ sqrt(719 + 110.25) ≈ sqrt(829.25) ≈ 28.8, as before.

So cos(theta) = -377.38 / (21 * 28.8) ≈ -377.38 / 604.8 ≈ -0.624. 

Arccos(-0.624) ≈ 128.7 degrees, which does not match the given 70 degrees. This indicates a serious contradiction, implying that my coordinate setup is flawed. 

Where is the mistake? Let me check the angle MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70°. According to the problem, this is the angle at L between K, L, J, which in the coordinate system is the angle between vectors LK and LJ, which we just calculated as ≈128.7 degrees, not 70. This suggests that the initial assumption about the position of points is wrong. 

Perhaps the angle at L is not 30°, but 70°, and the other angle is 110°? Let me reconsider the angle measures. 

Given the confusion, perhaps the given angle measures are not at point L, but elsewhere. Let me revisit the original predicates:

MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30°: this is angle at L between M, L, K → angle KLM = 30°.

MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70°: this is angle at L between K, L, J → angle JKL = 70°. 

But in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So at point L, the angles are angle KLM (30°) and angle JLM, which should add to 180°, making angle JLM = 150°. But the given MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) is 70°, which would be angle at L between K, L, J, which is angle JKL, not at point L. Wait, no, angle at L between K, L, J is angle at L, so it should be part of the angle at L. 

This suggests that the angle at L is composed of two angles: 30° and 70°, totaling 100°, which is not possible in a parallelogram. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the problem's given data, or perhaps a misinterpretation. 

Given the time I've spent without resolving the contradictions, perhaps I should look for alternative approaches using the given answer choices and the properties of parallelograms. 

The question asks for m∠KJL. In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. Also, the diagonals bisect each other and create vertical angles. 

Alternatively, since R is the midpoint of diagonals, and we know that in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so triangles formed by the diagonals are congruent. 

Let me consider triangle JRL and triangle KRM. Since R is the midpoint, JR = RL and KR = RM. Also, the diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, so triangles JKR and LKM are congruent. 

But how does this help with the angle at J? 

Alternatively, since we know the lengths of sides and some angles, maybe using the Law of Sines in certain triangles. 

Wait, in triangle JKL, if I can find the lengths of the sides, I can use the Law of Sines. But earlier attempts showed inconsistencies. 

Wait, let's try using the given angle measures. The problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(J,M,L)) = MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)), and MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)) = 80°, as per the given predicates. 

Wait, the predicates say:

Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,M,L)),MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)))

And Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)),80)

So MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)) is 80°, which is angle at K between J, K, L. Wait, angle at K between J, K, L is angle JKL. But earlier, there was a MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70°, which is angle at L between K, L, J. 

Wait, this is getting too confusing. Let me try to list all the angle measures given:

- MeasureOf(Angle(M,L,K)) = 30° → angle at L between M, L, K → angle KLM = 30°.

- MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,J)) = 70° → angle at L between K, L, J → angle JKL = 70°.

- MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) = 100° → angle at L between K, L, M → angle KLM = 100°, but this conflicts with the previous 30°.

- MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)) = 80° → angle at K between J, K, L → angle JKL = 80°, conflicting with the previous 70°.

- MeasureOf(Angle(J,M,L)) = 80° → angle at M between J, M, L → angle JML = 80°.

- MeasureOf(Angle(K,M,J)) = 100° → angle at M between K, M, J → angle KMJ = 100°.

- MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)) = 80° → angle at K between J, K, L → angle JKL = 80°.

This suggests that there are conflicting angle measures, likely due to mislabeling or misinterpretation. Given this, perhaps the correct angle to focus on is the one directly asked, which is ∠KJL. 

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So if one angle is 80°, the opposite angle is also 80°, and the other two angles are 100°. 

Wait, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)) = 80°, which is angle at K between J, K, L. In a parallelogram, this angle is equal to angle at M between J, M, L. So angle at K is 80°, and angle at M is also 80°. The other two angles at L and J are 100° each. 

If this is the case, then angle at J, which is ∠KJL, would be 100°, but this is one of the answer choices (D). But wait, let me confirm. 

Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. So if one angle is 80°, the adjacent angle is 100°. So if ∠KJL is at point J, it depends on which angle it is. 

If ∠KJL is one of the angles at point J, then it could be either 80° or 100°, depending on the configuration. 

But how to determine which one? Let me think. 

In a parallelogram, the angles at each vertex are either 80° or 100°. If ∠KJL is at point J, it could be one of these. 

But how to determine which? Let's consider the given angle measures. 

The problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) = 100°, which is angle at L between K, L, M. If angle at L is 100°, then the adjacent angle at K would be 80°, and so on. 

If ∠KJL is at point J, and if the angle at J is 80°, then it would be one of the answer choices. But the given answer choices include 80 (option C) and 100 (option D). 

But earlier, there was a conflicting angle measure of 70°, but perhaps that was a red herring or misinterpreted. 

Given the presence of MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)) = 80°, which is angle at K, and MeasureOf(Angle(J,M,L)) = 80°, which is angle at M, then the remaining angles at L and J are 100° each. 

Thus, m∠KJL, which is at point J, would be 100°, making the answer D. 

However, this assumes that the angle at J is 100°, which would be the case if the adjacent angle at K is 80°. 

But let me verify this with the given data. If angle at K is 80°, then the angle at J is 100°, and the angle at L is 80°, and at M is 100°. But this conflicts with the earlier given MeasureOf(Angle(K,L,M)) = 100°, which would be angle at L, making it 100°, and angle at K would be 80°, which fits. 

Thus, m∠KJL, which is the angle at J, would be 100°, corresponding to option D. 

But earlier calculations using coordinate geometry gave conflicting results, but possibly due to misinterpretation of the angle measures. Given the presence of the given angle MeasureOf(Angle(J,K,L)) = 80°, and knowing that in a parallelogram opposite angles are equal, it's plausible that the angle at J is 100°, making the answer D. 

However, another way to see this: in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other and the angle between the diagonals can be related to the angles of the parallelogram. But without more info, it's hard to say. 

Given the answer choices and the presence of 100° as an option, and the given angle measures pointing towards 80° and 100°, I think the intended answer is D: 100°.
