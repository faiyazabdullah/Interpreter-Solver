MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and understand the setup. So, we have three points labeled $1, $2, and $3, forming a triangle. There's an Angle(1) and Angle(2), with MeasureOf(Angle(1),40.0). Also, it says Right(Triangle($1,$2,$3)), meaning the triangle is a right triangle. 

Wait, the question mentions placing a ruler and a triangular plate as shown in the figure, but since there's no figure, I have to rely solely on the given predicates. The angle 1 is 40 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 2. The options are A:130°, B:140°, C:120°, D:125°.

Since the triangle is a right triangle, one of its angles is 90 degrees. But which angle? The problem mentions angles 1 and 2. Let me think. In a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. If it's a right triangle, then one angle is 90°, and the other two angles add up to 90°. 

But wait, the given angle 1 is 40°, so maybe angle 1 is one of the non-right angles. Then angle 2 would be the other non-right angle. Wait, but if angle 1 is 40°, then angle 2 would be 90° - 40° = 50°, but that's not among the options. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe angle 1 is the right angle? No, because angle 1 is given as 40°, so that can't be. 

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle isn't the right triangle directly, but the arrangement with the ruler and triangular plate creates some other configuration. Wait, the problem states that Triangle($1,$2,$3) is a right triangle. So the triangle formed by points 1, 2, 3 is a right triangle. Therefore, one of the angles in that triangle is 90°, and the other two angles sum to 90°. 

But how do angles 1 and 2 relate here? Are they angles of the triangle? The problem says "angle 1" and "angle 2", which could refer to angles within the triangle. However, since the triangle has three angles, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are two of them. But then where does the third angle come in?

Wait, if the triangle is right-angled, then one of its angles is 90°, and the other two are acute. Suppose angle 1 is one of those acute angles (40°), then angle 2 would be the other acute angle. Since the total of the two acute angles is 90°, angle 2 would be 90° - 40° = 50°, but again, that's not an option. So maybe angle 2 is the right angle? But the problem states that the triangle is right-angled, so the right angle is part of the triangle. But the given angle measures are 40°, which is probably one of the acute angles. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves more than just the triangle. The mention of a ruler and a triangular plate suggests that there might be another angle involved, like when the ruler forms a straight line with the triangle. For example, if the ruler is placed such that it extends beyond the triangle, creating a linear pair with one of the angles. 

Let me consider that scenario. Suppose the triangle is right-angled at point $3, making angle 3 the right angle. Then angles 1 and 2 are the other two angles. If angle 1 is 40°, then angle 2 would be 50°, but again, not in the options. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is adjacent to the right angle, forming a straight line. Wait, if the ruler is aligned with the hypotenuse, and the triangular plate is placed such that one angle is along the ruler... 

Alternatively, perhaps angle 2 refers to an exterior angle. For instance, if angle 1 is an interior angle of the triangle (say, 40°), then an exterior angle at that vertex would be supplementary to it, so 180° - 40° = 140°. That's option B. But why would the exterior angle be considered here? 

Wait, the problem mentions placing a ruler and a triangular plate as shown. Without seeing the figure, I'm assuming that angle 1 is inside the triangle, and angle 2 is an external angle created by extending a side. For example, if you extend one side of the triangle, forming an exterior angle. If angle 1 is 40°, then the exterior angle (angle 2) would be 180° - 40° = 140°, which is option B. 

But how does the right triangle factor in here? If the triangle is right-angled, say at point $3, then angles 1 and 2 would be the other two angles. If angle 1 is 40°, then angle 2 is 50°, but that's not matching. Unless angle 2 is referring to something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle is right-angled, and angle 1 is one of the non-right angles, and angle 2 is the angle formed between the ruler and the hypotenuse. Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's tricky. 

Another possibility: the right triangle has angles 90°, 40°, and 50°, totaling 180°. But if angle 2 is a different angle, maybe formed by the intersection of the ruler and the triangle. For example, if the ruler is placed such that it creates a straight line with one side of the triangle, making angle 2 supplementary to angle 1. 

So, if angle 1 is 40°, then angle 2 would be 180° - 40° = 140°, which is option B. This seems plausible. Given that the answer options include 140°, which is a common supplementary angle scenario. 

Therefore, considering that angle 1 is part of the triangle and angle 2 is an external angle formed by the ruler, the answer would be B:140°.
