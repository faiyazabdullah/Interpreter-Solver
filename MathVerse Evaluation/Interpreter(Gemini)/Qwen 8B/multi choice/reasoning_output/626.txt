MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the x-intercept of the line y = 4 - x. The problem mentions that the line has a negative slope and passes through the points (0,4) and (4,0). 

First, I need to recall what an x-intercept is. The x-intercept of a line is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. At that point, the y-coordinate is zero. So, to find the x-intercept, I should set y to 0 in the equation of the line and solve for x.

Given the equation y = 4 - x, substituting y with 0 gives 0 = 4 - x. Solving for x would involve rearranging the equation. Let me do that:

Starting with 0 = 4 - x, adding x to both sides gives x = 4. Therefore, the x-intercept is at (4, 0). Wait, but the problem already states that the line passes through (4,0), so that makes sense. 

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. The problem also mentions that the slope is less than 0, which aligns with the equation y = 4 - x because the coefficient of x is -1, making the slope -1, which is indeed negative. 

Another way to verify is by checking the two points given. The line passes through (0,4) and (4,0). The slope between these two points is (0 - 4)/(4 - 0) = (-4)/4 = -1, confirming the slope is negative. 

So, the x-intercept is when y=0, which we found to be x=4. Hence, the coordinates are (4, 0). But looking back at the answer choices, there's a mention of "No choices found." However, since the user hasn't provided actual options, maybe they were expecting me to infer that the answer is (4,0), which is one of the given points. Since the problem says to state the coordinates of the x-intercept, and according to the calculation, it's (4,0). 

Therefore, the correct answer should be (4,0), which corresponds to the point mentioned in the predicates. Even though there are no explicit answer choices listed, based on the problem's setup, the x-intercept is definitely (4,0).
