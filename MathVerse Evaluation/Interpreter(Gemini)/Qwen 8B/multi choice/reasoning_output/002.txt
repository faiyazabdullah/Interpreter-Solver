MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the setup based on the given predicates. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Lines AB, CD, EF, and EG. Angles 1 and 2 are mentioned, with Angle 1 being 50 degrees. Also, AB is parallel to CD. Line EF intersects AB at E and CD at F. Then, EG bisects angle BEF and intersects CD at G. 

Let me start by drawing a rough sketch mentally. Since AB is parallel to CD, and EF is a transversal cutting them at E and F respectively. So, AB || CD, with EF crossing AB at E and CD at F. Now, EG is the angle bisector of angle BEF, meeting CD at G. 

Given that angle 1 is 50 degrees. Wait, angle 1 is probably referring to one of the angles formed by the intersection. Let me check the predicates again. There's an Angle(1) and Angle(2). Also, there's a specific mention of Angle(B,E,F), which is angle BEF. And since EG bisects angle BEF, so angle BEG equals angle GEF. 

But wait, angle 1 is given as 50 degrees. Maybe angle 1 is one of these angles? Let me see. The problem says angle 1 is 50.0, so maybe angle 1 is angle BEF or one of its parts? Or perhaps another angle in the diagram. 

Wait, the problem states that angle 1 is 50.0, and asks for angle 2. So angle 2 is likely another angle in the figure. Since EG bisects angle BEF, and AB is parallel to CD, there might be some corresponding or alternate angles involved here. 

First, let's note down the key points:

1. AB || CD, so when cut by transversal EF, corresponding angles are equal. But EF intersects AB at E and CD at F. Therefore, angle at E (on AB) and angle at F (on CD) would be corresponding angles if EF were a transversal. However, since AB and CD are parallel, the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. Wait, but EF is intersecting AB at E and CD at F, making vertical angles and corresponding angles. 

But also, angle BEF is formed at point E between BE and EF. Since AB is a straight line, and E is on AB, then BE is part of AB. So angle BEF is the angle between BE (which is along AB) and EF. Since AB is parallel to CD, and EF is a transversal, the angle at E (angle BEF) corresponds to an angle at F. Wait, but angle at F would be angle EFD? Not sure yet. 

Alternatively, because of the parallel lines, the sum of the angles on the same side of the transversal should be 180 degrees. So angle BEF and angle EFD are consecutive interior angles, so they add up to 180 degrees. But angle BEF is being bisected by EG. 

Since EG bisects angle BEF, then each of the two angles created by the bisector (angle BEG and angle GEF) would be half of angle BEF. 

Now, angle 1 is given as 50 degrees. Which angle could that be? The problem mentions Angle(1) and Angle(2). In the predicates, there's also Angle(B,E,F) which is angle BEF. Maybe angle 1 refers to angle BEF? Because if that's the case, then angle BEF is 50 degrees. But the problem states that angle 1 is 50.0, so perhaps angle 1 is angle BEF. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the bisector EG?

Wait, let's look back at the predicates. The MeasureOf(Angle(1),50.0) – so angle 1 has measure 50 degrees. The other angle mentioned is angle 2. The question is asking for angle 2. 

In such problems, often angle 1 and angle 2 refer to different angles. For example, angle 1 could be angle BEF, and angle 2 could be angle EFG or something else. Let me try to think. 

Since EG bisects angle BEF, which is 50 degrees (assuming angle 1 is angle BEF), then each of the angles BEG and GEF would be 25 degrees each. Now, considering that AB is parallel to CD, and EF is a transversal, then angle EFG (at point F) would correspond to angle BEF. Wait, but angle EFG would be an alternate interior angle? Or same-side interior?

Wait, AB || CD, and EF is a transversal. So angle at E (BEF) and angle at F (EFD) are consecutive interior angles, hence supplementary. So angle BEF + angle EFD = 180 degrees. So if angle BEF is 50 degrees, then angle EFD would be 130 degrees. 

But where does point G come into play? EG intersects CD at G. So EG is the bisector of angle BEF, splitting it into two 25-degree angles. Now, looking at triangle EFG or something else. 

Alternatively, since EG meets CD at G, which is on CD. So point G is on CD. So line EG connects E to G on CD. Therefore, in triangle EFG, we have EG as a bisector. Wait, but how does that relate to angle 2?

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 refers to angle EGF or another angle. Let me think. 

Let me consider the angles around point E and F. At point E, we have angle BEF (given as 50 degrees). EG splits this into two angles: angle BEG and angle GEF, each 25 degrees. 

Then, since AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, angle at F (let's say angle EFC) would be equal to angle BEF (since they are alternate interior angles?), but wait, depends on the direction. Wait, AB || CD, and EF crosses them. So angle at E (on AB) and angle at F (on CD) would be either corresponding or alternate. 

Actually, since EF is cutting AB at E and CD at F, then angle BEF (at E) and angle EFD (at F) are consecutive interior angles, so they add up to 180 degrees. So angle EFD = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. 

Now, EG is drawn from E to G on CD. So EG is inside the angle BEF. Since EG bisects angle BEF, which is 50 degrees, then angle BEG = 25 degrees and angle GEF = 25 degrees. 

Now, looking at triangle EFG. We know angle at E (GEF) is 25 degrees, and angle at F (EFD) is 130 degrees. Wait, but angle at F in triangle EFG would be angle EFG. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify. 

Point G is on CD. So line EG goes from E to G on CD. So in triangle EFG, the vertices are E, F, G. The angles in triangle EFG are at E, F, and G. 

We know angle at E (between EF and EG) is 25 degrees (since EG bisects angle BEF, which was 50 degrees). At point F, angle EFG would be part of the angle at F. Earlier, we said angle EFD is 130 degrees. But since G is on CD, FG is a segment from F to G on CD. So angle EFG is adjacent to angle EFD? Or is it part of it?

Wait, point G is on CD. So line FG is part of CD. Therefore, angle EFG is the angle between EF and FG. Since FG is along CD, and angle EFD is the angle between EF and FD (where D is on CD). Wait, but G is another point on CD. So depending on where G is located, FG could be a portion of CD. 

But since EG is the bisector of angle BEF, and it meets CD at G, then maybe triangle EFG is formed. Let me try to find relations. 

In triangle EFG, we have angle at E is 25 degrees (from the bisector). What about angle at F? Let's think. Since AB || CD, and EF is a transversal. The angle between EF and CD at F is angle EFD, which is 130 degrees. But point G is on CD, so FG is part of CD. Thus, angle EFG is the same as angle EFD, which is 130 degrees? No, that doesn't make sense because angle EFG would be part of that. 

Wait, maybe angle EFG is supplementary to angle EFD. Wait, no. Let me think again. When you have line EF intersecting CD at F, the angle between EF and CD at F is angle EFC, which is the same as angle EFD if D is on the opposite side. Wait, perhaps I need to consider that. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, then angle BEF (at E) and angle EFD (at F) are consecutive interior angles, so they add up to 180 degrees. So angle EFD is 130 degrees. Now, line EG divides angle BEF into two 25-degree angles. Now, looking at triangle EFG, which includes angle at E (25 degrees), angle at F (which is part of the 130-degree angle), and angle at G. 

But how do we find angle 2? The question refers to angle 2. Assuming angle 2 is angle EGF or something else. 

Alternatively, since EG is the bisector, and G lies on CD, maybe there's a relationship involving triangle EGF or some other triangle. 

Another thought: since EG is the angle bisector of angle BEF (50 degrees), so each part is 25 degrees. Then, in triangle EFG, we have angle at E as 25 degrees, angle at F as... Well, angle at F is angle EFG. Let me consider that. 

Because AB || CD, and EF is a transversal. So angle EFG (at F) is equal to angle BEF (at E)? Wait, no. That would be if they were corresponding angles. But angle BEF is at E, and angle EFG is at F. Are they corresponding? If AB || CD, then angle BEF (at E on AB) and angle EFG (at F on CD) would be corresponding angles if EF were a transversal. Wait, yes! Because EF is the transversal cutting AB and CD. So angle BEF (at E) corresponds to angle EFG (at F). Therefore, angle EFG equals angle BEF, which is 50 degrees. 

Wait, but earlier we thought angle EFD was 130 degrees. How does that fit? If angle EFG is 50 degrees, then angle EFG is part of angle EFD. So angle EFG (50 degrees) plus angle GFD (the remaining part of angle EFD) would equal 130 degrees. So angle GFD would be 130 - 50 = 80 degrees. 

But how does this help us find angle 2? 

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is angle EGF, which is the third angle in triangle EFG. In triangle EFG, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So angle at E is 25 degrees, angle at F is 50 degrees, so angle at G (angle EGF) would be 180 - 25 - 50 = 105 degrees. But none of the options are 105. Hmm. That suggests I made a mistake. 

Wait, maybe my assumption that angle EFG equals angle BEF is incorrect. Let me re-examine that. 

AB is parallel to CD, EF is a transversal. So angle BEF (at E) and angle EFG (at F) are corresponding angles. Yes, because EF is the transversal, and AB || CD. So angle BEF corresponds to angle EFG. Hence, angle EFG = angle BEF = 50 degrees. 

But earlier, we had angle EFD (another angle at F) being 130 degrees. How is that possible? Because angle EFG is part of angle EFD. Wait, angle EFD is the angle between EF and FD. But since G is a point on CD, then FG is part of CD. So angle EFG is adjacent to angle GFD. Therefore, angle EFD = angle EFG + angle GFD. 

So angle EFD = 130 degrees, angle EFG = 50 degrees, so angle GFD = 130 - 50 = 80 degrees. 

Now, in triangle EFG, angles are at E (25 degrees), at F (50 degrees), and at G. Summing those gives 25+50=75, so angle at G (angle EGF) is 180 - 75 = 105 degrees. 

But the question asks for angle 2. Where is angle 2? The problem mentions angle 2, but I haven't identified which angle that is. Let me check the predicates again. 

Looking back, there's a mention of Angle(2), but no specific details. However, the problem statement says "angle 1 = 50.0", so angle 2 is the other angle we're supposed to find. Given that angle 1 is 50 degrees, angle 2 might be angle EGF (which I just calculated as 105 degrees), but that's not among the options. Alternatively, maybe angle 2 refers to angle GFD, which is 80 degrees, but that's not listed either. 

Hmm, this suggests that my assumptions may be wrong. Let me go back. 

Alternative approach: Perhaps angle 1 is not angle BEF but another angle. Let me re-examine the given predicates. 

There's a predicate: BisectsAngle(Line(E,G),Angle(B,E,F)). This means that EG bisects angle BEF. So angle BEF is split into two equal angles by EG. Also, the MeasureOf(Angle(1),50.0) — so angle 1 is 50 degrees. Could angle 1 be one of the bisected angles? 

Yes! If angle BEF is being bisected by EG, then each of the resulting angles (angle BEG and angle GEF) would be half of angle BEF. So if angle 1 is one of these bisected angles, then angle BEG or angle GEF is 50 degrees. But that would mean angle BEF is 100 degrees, since it's twice 50. 

Wait, this contradicts previous thinking. So which is it? Is angle 1 angle BEF or one of its bisected parts? 

The problem says "as shown in the figure" — but without seeing the figure, we have to infer from the predicates. 

The Angle(1) is mentioned, and Angle(2) is the one we need to find. Also, the problem states that EG bisects angle BEF. 

Let me consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Angle 1 is angle BEF. Then, angle BEF = 50 degrees. Then, since EG bisects it, each part is 25 degrees. Then, using the parallel lines, angle EFD = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. Then, in triangle EFG, angle at E is 25 degrees, angle at F is 50 degrees (corresponding angle), leading to angle EGF = 105 degrees. But this isn't an option.

Scenario 2: Angle 1 is one of the bisected angles. Suppose angle 1 is angle GEF (or BEG), so it's 50 degrees. Then, angle BEF is 100 degrees. Then, angle EFD (consecutive interior angle) would be 80 degrees. Then, in triangle EFG, angle at E is 50 degrees, angle at F is 80 degrees (since angle EFD is 80, and angle EFG would be part of it? Wait, no. If angle BEF is 100 degrees, then angle EFD (consecutive interior) is 80 degrees. Then, angle EFG would be equal to angle BEF (corresponding angles), so angle EFG = 100 degrees. Wait, but that conflicts with angle EFD being 80 degrees. 

This seems conflicting. Let me think again. If AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, then angle BEF and angle EFD are consecutive interior angles, adding to 180 degrees. So if angle BEF is 100 degrees, then angle EFD is 80 degrees. 

But angle EFG is a part of angle EFD. Since EG is drawn from E to G on CD. So angle EFG is part of angle EFD. But how much? 

Since EG bisects angle BEF (which is 100 degrees), creating two angles of 50 degrees each. So angle GEF is 50 degrees. Then, in triangle EFG, angle at E is 50 degrees (GEF), angle at F is angle EFG. But angle EFG is part of angle EFD, which is 80 degrees. 

Wait, angle EFG would be equal to angle BEF if they are corresponding angles. But angle BEF is 100 degrees. But angle EFD is 80 degrees. So this is inconsistent. 

This suggests that my assumption that angle EFG equals angle BEF is wrong. Maybe angle EFG is not a corresponding angle. Let me re-examine. 

When AB || CD and EF is a transversal, the corresponding angles would be angle BEF (at E) and angle EFC (at F). Wait, angle EFC is the angle between EF and FC. But since CD is a straight line, and G is a point on CD, then FC is part of CD. So angle EFC is the same as angle EFG if G is aligned with F and C. But if G is somewhere else on CD, like closer to F, then angle EFG is part of angle EFD. 

This is getting complicated without the figure. Let me try another approach. 

Since EG bisects angle BEF, and AB || CD, maybe we can use the property of angle bisectors in parallel lines. 

Suppose angle BEF is x degrees. Then, the bisector EG creates two angles of x/2. Since AB || CD, the alternate interior angles would be equal. For example, angle BEF (x) is equal to angle EFG (alternate interior angle). Wait, is that true? 

Wait, if AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, then angle BEF (at E) and angle EFG (at F) are alternate interior angles? No, because alternate interior angles are on opposite sides of the transversal. 

Actually, angle BEF is on one side of EF, while angle EFG would be on the other side. Wait, maybe they are corresponding angles. 

Let me draw this mentally: AB is horizontal, CD is parallel to AB, EF is a diagonal line crossing AB at E and CD at F. Then, angle BEF is at E, between BE (part of AB) and EF. The corresponding angle would be at F, between EF and a line parallel to AB. Since CD is parallel to AB, the corresponding angle at F would be angle EFC (if CF is the extension of CD). 

Therefore, angle BEF corresponds to angle EFC, making them equal. So angle EFC = angle BEF. 

If that's the case, then angle EFC = x degrees. But angle EFC is at point F, between EF and FC. Since G is a point on CD, then FG is a segment from F to G on CD. So angle EFG is part of angle EFC. 

Wait, but if angle EFC is x, then angle EFG would depend on where G is located. If G is beyond F, then angle EFG would be zero. But since G is an intersection point, it's more likely that G is between F and D, or on the other side. 

Alternatively, since EG is the bisector of angle BEF, which is x degrees, then each part is x/2. Let me consider triangle EFG. In triangle EFG, we have angle at E as x/2, angle at F as y, and angle at G as z. The sum is 180. 

But I need to relate these angles using the parallel lines. 

Also, since AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, the sum of angle BEF (x) and angle EFD (the consecutive interior angle) is 180. So angle EFD = 180 - x. 

But angle EFD is composed of angle EFG and angle GFD. Depending on where G is, but assuming G is between F and D, then angle EFG + angle GFD = angle EFD = 180 - x. 

But without knowing where G is, it's hard to proceed. However, the fact that EG bisects angle BEF implies that x is split into two equal parts. 

Now, the problem says angle 1 is 50 degrees. If angle 1 is one of the bisected angles (say, angle GEF), then x = 2*50 = 100 degrees. Then, angle EFD = 180 - 100 = 80 degrees. 

So angle EFD = 80 degrees, which is angle EFG + angle GFD. If EG is the bisector, then in triangle EFG, angle at E is 50 degrees, angle at F is angle EFG. To find angle EFG, we need more info. 

But since EG is the bisector, and G is on CD, maybe there's a way to relate angles via triangle EFG. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and EG is a line from E to G on CD, forming triangle EFG. Let me think about the angles in triangle EFG. 

We have angle at E: 50 degrees (half of angle BEF, which is 100). At point F, angle EFG is part of the 80-degree angle EFD. But how much? 

If I assume that angle EFG is equal to angle BEF (corresponding angles), which would be 100 degrees, but that exceeds the total of 80 degrees for angle EFD. So that can't be. 

Maybe angle EFG is equal to angle BEF minus some value? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since EG is the angle bisector, maybe there's a relation using the angle bisector theorem. The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the segments divided by the bisector is proportional to the adjacent sides. But since we don't have lengths, this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and EG intersects CD at G, maybe there's a way to find angle at G. 

Wait, in triangle EFG, we have angle at E = 50 degrees (from bisector), angle at F is angle EFG. If I can find angle EFG, then angle at G (angle EGF) is 180 - 50 - angle EFG. 

But how to find angle EFG? 

Since AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, angle EFC (at F) is equal to angle BEF (100 degrees). But angle EFC is the angle between EF and FC. Since G is on CD, FG is a segment from F to G. So angle EFG is part of angle EFC. If G is between F and C, then angle EFG is part of angle EFC. But unless we know where G is, it's unclear. 

However, since EG is the bisector of angle BEF, which is 100 degrees, and G lies on CD, maybe there's a relationship involving the angles at G. 

Wait, let's assume that angle EFG is equal to angle EFC (which is 100 degrees), but that would imply that G is positioned such that FG extends beyond F, which might not be the case. 

Alternatively, maybe angle EFG is equal to angle EFD (80 degrees), but that would require G to be at a specific position. 

This is getting too ambiguous without the figure. Let me reconsider the initial assumption that angle 1 is angle BEF or one of its bisected angles. 

The problem says "angle 1 = 50.0". Given that EG bisects angle BEF, and angle 1 is mentioned, it's possible that angle 1 is one of the angles created by the bisector. So, if angle BEF is split into two angles by EG, and one of those is 50 degrees, then angle BEF is 100 degrees. 

Thus, angle BEF = 100 degrees, so angle 1 is one of the bisected angles (50 degrees). Then, since AB || CD, angle EFD (the consecutive interior angle) is 80 degrees. 

Now, in triangle EFG, we have angle at E is 50 degrees (from the bisector), angle at F is part of angle EFD (80 degrees). If we assume that angle EFG is equal to angle EFC (which would be angle BEF, 100 degrees), but that's impossible because angle EFD is only 80 degrees. 

Wait, maybe angle EFG is equal to angle EFD? No, that would make it 80 degrees. So in triangle EFG, angles would be 50 degrees at E, 80 degrees at F, so angle at G is 50 degrees. Then, angle 2 would be 50 degrees. But that's option A. But that seems too straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe angle EFG is not 80 degrees, but something else. 

Let me try this: if AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, then angle BEF (100 degrees) and angle EFC are corresponding angles, so angle EFC = 100 degrees. But angle EFC is at point F, between EF and FC. Since G is on CD, then FG is a segment from F to G. If G is between F and C, then angle EFG is part of angle EFC. 

So angle EFG = angle EFC - angle GFC. But I don't know where G is. 

However, since EG is the bisector of angle BEF (100 degrees), and G is on CD, maybe we can use the angle bisector theorem in terms of angles. 

Alternatively, consider triangle EFG. We know angle at E is 50 degrees, and angle at F is angle EFG. Let's denote angle EFG as y. Then, angle at G is 180 - 50 - y = 130 - y. 

Now, since AB || CD, and EG is a line from E to G on CD, maybe there's a relationship between angles at G. 

For instance, angle at G (angle EGF) could be related to other angles. 

Alternatively, since CD is parallel to AB, and EG is a transversal, maybe angle EGF is equal to some other angle. 

Wait, if we extend EG to meet CD at G, then angle EGF is an angle at G on CD. Since AB || CD, and EG is a transversal, maybe there's a corresponding or alternate angle. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me try plugging in numbers. Assume angle 1 is 50 degrees, which is one of the bisected angles, so angle BEF is 100 degrees. Then, angle EFD = 80 degrees. 

In triangle EFG, angle at E is 50 degrees, angle at F is angle EFG. Let's say angle EFG = 80 degrees. Then, angle at G would be 180 - 50 - 80 = 50 degrees. So angle EGF is 50 degrees. If angle 2 is this angle, then the answer would be 50 degrees (option A). But why would angle 2 be this angle? 

Alternatively, if angle EFG is something else. Wait, angle EFG is part of angle EFD (80 degrees). If EG is the angle bisector, maybe there's a way to find angle EFG. 

Wait, since EG bisects angle BEF (100 degrees), then in triangle EFG, we have angle at E = 50 degrees, and angle at F is part of the 80-degree angle. 

But without more info, it's hard to determine. However, if angle EGF is 50 degrees, then angle 2 is 50 degrees. But why would that be the case? 

Alternatively, if angle EGF is equal to angle BEG (which is 50 degrees), due to some parallel line properties. 

But this is all guesswork. Let me check the answer choices again: A:50°, B:60°, C:65°, D:90°. 

If I assume that angle 2 is 50 degrees, then answer A. But if angle 2 is 65, then answer C. 

Wait, another approach: since angle BEF is 100 degrees, and it's bisected into 50 degrees each. Then, in triangle EFG, angle at E is 50 degrees, and angle at F is angle EFG. Let me consider that since AB || CD, and EF is a transversal, angle EFG is equal to angle BEF (100 degrees)? No, that would be if they were corresponding angles, but angle EFG is part of the 80-degree angle EFD. 

Wait, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate. 

If AB || CD, then angle BEF and angle EFD are consecutive interior angles, so they add to 180. If angle BEF is 100 degrees, then angle EFD is 80 degrees. 

EG bisects angle BEF into two 50-degree angles. Now, consider line EG intersecting CD at G. So, in triangle EFG, we have angle at E = 50 degrees, angle at F = ? 

If I can find angle EFG, then I can find angle at G. 

But how? 

Since AB || CD, and EG is a line from E to G on CD. Let me think about the angles formed at G. 

At point G, we have angle EGF. Since CD is parallel to AB, and EG is a transversal, angle EGF might be equal to some angle on AB. 

For example, if we extend EG to meet AB, but it already starts at E on AB. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and EG intersects CD at G, then the angle between EG and CD at G is equal to the angle between EG and AB at E. Wait, no. 

Wait, the angle between EG and CD at G is supplementary to the angle between EG and AB at E, because AB || CD. 

Wait, let's think: at point E, the angle between BE (which is on AB) and EG is 50 degrees (since EG bisects angle BEF into 50 degrees). At point G, the angle between EG and CD is some angle. Since AB || CD, the angle between EG and CD at G should be equal to the angle between EG and AB at E, because they are alternate interior angles. 

Wait, if AB || CD, and EG is a transversal, then the angle between EG and AB at E (which is 50 degrees) is equal to the angle between EG and CD at G. So angle EGF (at G) is equal to 50 degrees. 

Ah! That makes sense. Because AB || CD, and EG is a transversal, so the alternate interior angles are equal. Hence, angle between EG and AB at E (which is 50 degrees) equals the angle between EG and CD at G. So angle EGF = 50 degrees. 

Therefore, angle 2 is 50 degrees, which is option A. 

But wait, the problem says angle 1 is 50 degrees. If angle 2 is also 50 degrees, then the answer is A. But why would angle 2 be this angle? 

The problem says "angle 1 = 50.0", and asks for angle 2. If angle 1 is one of the bisected angles (50 degrees), then angle 2 could be the alternate interior angle, which is also 50 degrees. So the answer would be A. 

But this feels too simple, and the presence of options like 65 suggests there might be a different approach. 

Wait, let me verify this conclusion. If angle between EG and AB at E is 50 degrees, then the alternate interior angle at G is also 50 degrees. So angle EGF is 50 degrees, which would be angle 2. Hence, answer A. 

But let me cross-check. If angle BEF is 100 degrees, and EG bisects it into two 50-degree angles. Then, the alternate interior angle at G is 50 degrees, so angle EGF is 50 degrees. Thus, angle 2 is 50 degrees. 

But the answer choices include 50° (option A). So the answer would be A. 

But wait, initially, I thought angle 1 might be angle BEF, leading to angle 2 being 105 degrees, which wasn't an option. But if angle 1 is one of the bisected angles (50 degrees), then angle 2 is 50 degrees. 

But the problem states that angle 1 is 50.0, and asks for angle 2. It's possible that angle 1 is the bisected angle, making angle 2 also 50 degrees. 

But I'm still unsure because sometimes problems might define angle 1 and angle 2 differently. Let me think again. 

The problem says: "angle 1 = 50.0, then angle 2 is equal to ()". If angle 1 is one of the bisected angles (50 degrees), then angle 2 is the alternate interior angle, which is also 50 degrees. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is angle BEF (100 degrees), then angle 2 is 50 degrees. Either way, the answer could be A. 

But why would angle 2 be 50? Let me confirm once more. 

If angle BEF is 100 degrees (so angle 1 is one of its halves, 50 degrees), then angle EGF (alternate interior angle) is 50 degrees. So angle 2 is 50 degrees. Hence, answer A. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is angle BEF (100 degrees), then angle 2 could be something else. But since 100 isn't an option, this scenario is invalid. 

Thus, the correct answer must be A:50°.
