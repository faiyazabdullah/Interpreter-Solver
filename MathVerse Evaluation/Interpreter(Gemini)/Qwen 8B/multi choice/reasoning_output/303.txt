MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two triangles, RST and ABC, which are congruent. That means all corresponding sides and angles are equal. The question gives us some equations involving angles and side lengths, and we need to find the value of x.

First, I'll list out all the given information. 

We know that Triangle(R,S,T) is congruent to Triangle(A,B,C). So, their corresponding parts should be equal. Also, there are some angle measures given. Specifically, MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)) equals Add(Mul(5,x),20). And MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)) equals Add(Mul(3,x),40). But wait, there's also a statement that these two angles are equal: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)),MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A))). Since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding angles should be equal. Let me make sure about the correspondence here. 

In congruent triangles, the order of the vertices matters. So if Triangle RST ≅ Triangle ABC, then angle R corresponds to angle A, angle S to B, and angle T to C. Wait, but the angle mentioned here is Angle(R,S,T), which is angle at point S? Wait, no. In a triangle, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(R,S,T) would be the angle at point S, because it's the middle letter. Similarly, Angle(C,B,A) is the angle at point B. Wait, but according to the problem statement, they say that MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)). So angle at S in triangle RST equals angle at B in triangle ABC. But since the triangles are congruent, maybe there's a different correspondence?

Wait, but congruence implies that corresponding angles are equal. However, depending on the order of the letters in the congruence statement. The problem says Triangle(R,S,T) ≅ Triangle(A,B,C). Therefore, the order of the vertices indicates the correspondence. So vertex R corresponds to A, S to B, T to C. Therefore, angle RST (which is angle at S) corresponds to angle B in triangle ABC. Wait, angle at S in RST corresponds to angle at B in ABC? Wait, no. Let me think again.

In triangle RST, the vertices are R, S, T. The angle at S is ∠RST, which is formed by points R-S-T. In triangle ABC, the angle at B is ∠ABC, formed by points A-B-C. So if the triangles are congruent with the order RST ≅ ABC, then angle at S in RST corresponds to angle at B in ABC. Therefore, ∠RST ≅ ∠ABC. Wait, but the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)). Wait, Angle(C,B,A) is the angle at B in triangle ABC. Because in angle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So ∠CBA is the angle at B. So the measure of ∠RST equals measure of ∠CBA. Which would mean that those two angles are equal. But since the triangles are congruent, that's expected if the correspondence is correct. Wait, but perhaps the correspondence isn't directly R→A, S→B, T→C? Maybe there's another correspondence? Or maybe the problem has a typo? Wait, no. The problem says that the triangles are congruent, so the order of the letters matters. So if Triangle(R,S,T) ≅ Triangle(A,B,C), then the correspondence is R→A, S→B, T→C. Thus, ∠RST (at S) corresponds to ∠ABC (at B). Therefore, their measures are equal. But according to the given equations, MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)), which is ∠CBA, same as ∠ABC. So that checks out. So that equation is consistent with the congruence. 

So, the first thing is that ∠RST equals ∠ABC. Then, the problem gives expressions for these angles. Let me write down the equations:

MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)) = 5x + 20  
MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)) = 3x + 40  

But since they are equal, set them equal to each other:  
5x + 20 = 3x + 40  
Subtract 3x from both sides: 2x + 20 = 40  
Subtract 20: 2x = 20 → x = 10. 

Wait, but before jumping to conclusion, let me check if there are other constraints. Also, the problem mentions that ST = 2y - 8 and CB = y + 13. Additionally, it says that ST equals CB because they are corresponding sides in congruent triangles. So, LengthOf(ST) = LengthOf(CB). Therefore, 2y - 8 = y + 13. Solving this: subtract y from both sides: y - 8 = 13 → y = 21. 

But does this affect the value of x? Well, the problem asks for x, and from the angle equality, we found x=10. But maybe there's something missing here. Let me verify. 

Wait, but maybe there's more to consider. For example, the sum of angles in a triangle. Let me check if the angles add up correctly. Let's take the angles in triangle RST. We have one angle at S being 5x+20. Let's call that angle. Since the triangles are congruent, the other angles would correspond accordingly. However, since we only have one angle given for each triangle, maybe we need to ensure that the total angles sum to 180 degrees. But since we have two equations leading to x=10, and the other equation gives y=21, but the problem doesn't mention anything else. 

Alternatively, could there be an error in assuming that the correspondence of angles is straightforward? For example, maybe the triangles are congruent, but the angle measures given aren't necessarily the corresponding ones. Wait, but the problem explicitly states that ∠RST equals ∠CBA. Which in the congruent triangles would imply that they are corresponding angles. So the earlier calculation seems valid. 

Let me recheck the equations:

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(R,S,T)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,A)). These are two angles that are equal. From the problem's given expressions:

Angle(R,S,T) is 5x + 20.  
Angle(C,B,A) is 3x + 40.  
Setting them equal: 5x + 20 = 3x + 40 → 2x = 20 → x = 10. 

That seems straightforward. But why is there a mention of ST and CB? Is there a possibility that these side lengths relate to the angles somehow? For instance, maybe using the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines? But since we don't have other angles or sides, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here? Let me check again. 

Wait, the problem says that ST = 2y - 8 and CB = y + 13, and they are equal because the triangles are congruent. So solving for y gives y = 21. But how does that affect x? It doesn't seem to directly involve x. Unless there's an implicit relationship between angles and sides that I'm missing. 

But the problem only gives us one equation relating x, and that leads directly to x=10. So unless there's another constraint, like the sum of angles in a triangle, but even then, with only one angle given, we can't compute the others. 

Wait, let me think again. Suppose we consider triangle RST. One of its angles is 5x + 20. Let's suppose that x=10, making that angle 5*10 +20=70 degrees. Then, since the triangle is congruent to ABC, angle at B (which is ∠CBA) is also 70 degrees. Now, in triangle ABC, if we have angle at B equal to 70 degrees, and side CB is y + 13. But without knowing other angles or sides, we can't derive more info. 

Therefore, the only equation involving x is the one equating the two angles. Hence, x=10. Looking at the answer choices, B is 10. So the answer should be B. 

But just to make sure, let me check if there's any other way x could be involved. For example, maybe the problem requires checking that the angles fit into a triangle, i.e., sum to 180. Let's see. Suppose x=10, then angle at S is 70 degrees. What about the other angles? 

In triangle RST, angles are at R, S, T. We know angle at S is 70 degrees. Let's assume that the other angles are determined by the congruence. But since we don't have other angle measures given, maybe we can't confirm. However, the problem doesn't state that the triangles are valid, so we can assume that the given conditions hold. 

Another thought: since the triangles are congruent, their corresponding sides are equal. So ST corresponds to CB, which we used to find y=21. But that's separate from x. Therefore, the answer for x is indeed 10. 

Thus, the correct answer is B.
