MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about two street lamps, A and B, separated by 30 meters. Xiaogang walks 25 meters from the base of lamp A to the base of lamp B, and at some point during this walk, the top of his head touches the bottom of lamp B. His height is 1.5 meters. We need to find the height of the street lamp.

First, I need to visualize the scenario. There are two vertical lampposts, A and B. Let me imagine them as vertical lines. The distance between their bases is 30 meters. Xiaogang starts at the base of A, walks 25 meters towards B, and at that point, his head level aligns with the bottom of lamp B. Wait, but if he walked 25 meters from A to B, which are 30 meters apart, that means he didn't reach B yet. So there's a triangle formed here maybe?

Let me think. When he walks 25 meters from A to B, the distance between A and B is 30 meters. So the remaining distance from his position to B would be 30 - 25 = 5 meters. But how does his height come into play? Since his head touches the bottom of lamp B, perhaps we have similar triangles here.

Wait, the problem mentions that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of lamp B. So maybe the line of sight from his eye level to the tip of lamp B creates a right triangle? Or maybe the height of the lamp relates to his height through similar triangles?

Let me draw this mentally. Suppose lamp A has height h_A and lamp B has height h_B. Xiaogang's height is 1.5 m. When he walks 25 meters from A towards B, he's standing at a point where the line connecting his eyes to the top of lamp B is horizontal? No, wait, because he's looking up to the bottom of lamp B. Wait, the bottom of lamp B is at ground level. So if his head is touching the bottom of lamp B, that suggests that his eye level is at the same height as the base of lamp B. Wait, but lamp B is vertical, so its base is on the ground. So if his head is touching the bottom of lamp B, that implies that his head is at the same height as the base of lamp B, which is zero? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a translation issue. Perhaps the top of his head touches the bottom of the lamp's light? Wait, maybe the lamp's light is at the top, and when he looks up, the top of his head aligns with the bottom of the lamp's light? Or maybe the shadow?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves similar triangles. Let me consider that when Xiaogang stands at a certain point, the line from his eye level to the top of lamp B forms a triangle similar to another triangle involving the heights of the lamps.

But since he's walking from A to B, and the distance between A and B is 30 meters. He walks 25 meters, so he's 5 meters away from B. Let's model this as a coordinate system. Let me set coordinates: Let’s place point A at (0, 0) and point B at (30, 0). Xiaogang walks from A to B, so his position is at x = 25 meters from A, which is at x = 25. So his position is (25, 0). Wait, but his height is 1.5 meters, so his eye level is 1.5 meters above the ground. Now, if he looks towards lamp B, which is at (30, 0), and the top of his head touches the bottom of lamp B. Wait, the bottom of lamp B is at ground level, so that would mean his head is at ground level, but his height is 1.5 meters. This seems conflicting. Therefore, maybe there's a misinterpretation here.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the top of his figure (head) just touched the bottom of the street lamp B. But street lamps are usually tall poles. So maybe the lamp itself is vertical, and when Xiaogang stands at that point, the line from his eye to the top of lamp B passes through his head? Or perhaps the shadow of his head reaches the base of the lamp?

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the light from lamp B being blocked by his head, implying that the line from the top of lamp B to his eye passes through his head. So, forming similar triangles.

Let me try again. Let's assume that lamp B has a height H. When Xiaogang is standing 25 meters from A (and thus 5 meters from B), his line of sight to the top of lamp B would form a triangle. However, since his head is at 1.5 meters, and the line of sight from his eye (which is at 1.5m) to the top of lamp B (height H) would pass through his head. Wait, but how does that relate?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about shadows. If the sun is shining at an angle such that the shadow of lamp B is cast onto the ground, and Xiaogang's shadow length corresponds to something. But the problem states that when he walks 25 meters from A to B, his head touches the bottom of lamp B. Hmm.

Another thought: Since he walked 25 meters from A to B, and the total distance between A and B is 30 meters, then he is 5 meters away from B. At that point, the top of his head touches the bottom of lamp B. Wait, if the lamp B is vertical, then the bottom of the lamp is at the ground level. So his head is at the same height as the base of the lamp. Which would imply that his head is at ground level, but his height is 1.5 meters. Contradiction. Therefore, perhaps the problem is referring to the top of the lamp being aligned with his head? Or maybe the shadow of the lamp?

Wait, maybe the problem is similar to similar triangles where the ratio of distances equals the ratio of heights. For example, if the lamp's height is H, then the triangle formed by lamp B and the distance from Xiaogang to B would be similar to the triangle formed by Xiaogang's height and the distance from him to lamp A?

Wait, let me think again. Let's consider that when Xiaogang is standing at 25 meters from A, the line from his eye level (at 1.5m) to the top of lamp B (which is H meters high) would form a triangle. But since he's standing 5 meters away from B, the horizontal distance from him to B is 5 meters. The vertical difference between the top of the lamp and his eye level is H - 1.5 meters. Then, the slope of that line would be (H - 1.5)/5. Alternatively, if there's another triangle involving lamp A's height?

Wait, but we don't know the height of lamp A. However, maybe there's another relationship. Since the problem mentions that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of lamp B. Wait, maybe the lamp B's height is such that when he stands at 25 meters from A, the line from the top of his head to the base of lamp B is horizontal? That would mean that the line is horizontal, so the height of the lamp B's base is the same as his head height. But then the lamp B's base is on the ground, so that would mean his head is at ground level, which contradicts his height of 1.5 meters. Hence, this interpretation is wrong.

Alternative approach: Let me look back at the given predicates. The user mentioned several geometric predicates like Line(A,$), RightAngle, LengthOf, Sub, Parallel, Perpendicular, Triangle, Similar. These seem to be part of a formal geometric system. Let me parse them.

From the predicates:

- Point(A), Point(B): Points named A and B.

- Line(A,$), Line(B,$): Lines starting from A and B respectively.

- Line($1,$2): Another line between points $1 and $2.

- RightAngle(Angle(A,$,$1)): Angle at point $ between lines A-$ and $-$1 is a right angle.

Similarly for RightAngle(Angle(B,$,$2)).

LengthOf(Line(A,$))=25.0: The length of the line from A to some point $ is 25.0 units.

LengthOf(Line($,$2))=30.0: The length of the line between $ and $2 is 30.0.

Sub(LengthOf(Line($,$2)),LengthOf(Line(A,$)),5.0): So 30.0 minus 25.0 equals 5.0, which checks out.

LengthOf(Line($1,$))=1.5: The line from $1 to $ has length 1.5.

Parallel(Line(A,$),Line($1,$)): Lines from A-$ and $1-$ are parallel.

Perpendicular(Line(A,$),Line($)): Line from A-$ is perpendicular to Line($).

Perpendicular(Line($1,$),Line($)): Line from $1-$ is also perpendicular to Line($).

Triangle(A,$1,$2): Triangle with vertices A, $1, $2.

Similar(Triangle(A,$1,$2),Triangle($3,$4,$5)): Triangles A-$1-$2 and $3-$4-$5 are similar.

Now, trying to interpret these in the context of the problem. The main question is about the height of street lamp B. Given that Xiaogang walked 25 meters from A to B, and his height is 1.5 meters.

Assuming that the street lamps are represented as vertical lines (since they're called 'street lamps', likely vertical poles). Let me try to map the predicates to the problem.

Let me suppose that the line from A to $ is a horizontal line, since the length is 25.0. Also, Line($,$2) has length 30.0, which is the separation between the two street lamps. Wait, the first line is Line(A,$), which is 25.0, and Line($,$2) is 30.0. The Sub function indicates that 30.0 - 25.0 = 5.0, which could represent the remaining distance from Xiaogang's position to B. 

Also, there's a line $1-$ with length 1.5, which could be Xiaogang's height. And lines from A-$ and $1-$ are parallel, and both are perpendicular to Line($). So, perhaps Line($) is a common perpendicular to those lines. 

This suggests that Line($) is a vertical line, and Line(A,$) and Line($1,$) are horizontal lines. Because if they are perpendicular to Line($), which is vertical, then Line(A,$) and Line($1,$) would be horizontal. 

So, the setup could be: There are two horizontal lines (from A to $ and from $1 to $) that are parallel. Both are perpendicular to a vertical line $. So, Line($) is vertical. 

Then, the length of Line(A,$) is 25.0, which is the horizontal distance from A to point $. Similarly, the length of Line($,$2) is 30.0, which is the distance between $ and $2. The subtraction gives 5.0, which may represent the distance from $ to $2 minus the distance from A to $? 

But how does this fit with the problem? 

Xiaogang walked from the bottom of A (point A?) to the bottom of B (point B?), which are separated by 30.0 meters. Wait, but the Line($,$2) is 30.0, which could be AB. So, points A and B are separated by 30.0 meters. 

When Xiaogang walked from A to B, which is 30.0 meters, but he walked 25.0 meters, so he was 5.0 meters away from B. 

At that point, his height (1.5 meters) caused the top of his head to touch the bottom of street lamp B. Assuming that the street lamp B is at point B, which is 30.0 meters from A. 

But how does the height of the lamp factor in? Maybe the line from the top of the lamp to the point where Xiaogang stood forms a triangle with his height. 

Given that the line from A to $ is 25.0 meters, and the line from $ to $2 is 30.0 meters. The line from $1 to $ is 1.5 meters. Also, lines A-$ and $1-$ are parallel and perpendicular to Line($. 

So, if Line($) is vertical, then points A and $1 are horizontally aligned with the base of the lamp B ($2)? 

Maybe we have two vertical lines (Lamp A and Lamp B) and some horizontal lines. 

Alternatively, considering the similar triangles. Since the problem mentions similarity of triangles. 

There's a triangle A-$1-$2, and another triangle $3-$4-$5. 

Perhaps the triangle formed by lamp A, Xiaogang's height, and the distance from A to his position, and another triangle formed by lamp B, the distance from his position to B, and the lamp's height. 

Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides should be equal. 

Let me formalize this. 

Assume that the street lamps are vertical poles. Let’s denote the height of lamp A as h_A and lamp B as h_B. Xiaogang's height is 1.5 meters. 

He walks from the base of lamp A (distance 25 meters) to the base of lamp B, stopping at a point 25 meters from A, which is 5 meters from B. 

At this point, the line from the top of his head (which is 1.5 meters high) to the top of lamp B forms a triangle. Wait, but if the top of his head is aligned with the base of lamp B, then the vertical distance between his head and the lamp's base is zero. But that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, if the line from his eye level to the top of lamp B creates a similar triangle with the lamp A's height. 

Let me think in terms of similar triangles. 

Imagine that when Xiaogang is standing 25 meters from A and 5 meters from B, the line from the top of lamp A to the top of lamp B passes through his head. Wait, but the problem says the top of his figure touches the bottom of lamp B. Maybe the line from the top of lamp A to his head passes through lamp B's base? 

Alternatively, the line from the top of lamp B to his eye level passes through the top of lamp A? Not sure. 

Alternatively, considering the similar triangles formed by the heights of the lamps and the distances from Xiaogang. 

Let me try setting up variables. Let’s say the height of lamp A is h_A, lamp B is h_B. Xiaogang is standing 25 meters from A and 5 meters from B. His height is 1.5 meters. 

If we assume that the triangles formed by the lamps and the distances are similar, then the ratio of the heights would be equal to the ratio of the distances. 

For instance, the triangle formed by lamp A (height h_A) and the distance from A to Xiaogang (25 meters) would be similar to the triangle formed by lamp B (height h_B) and the distance from Xiaogang to B (5 meters). 

Wait, but why would they be similar? Unless the line of sight is parallel to the ground, which would require the triangles to be similar. 

Alternatively, the triangle formed by lamp A and the line from A to Xiaogang, and the triangle formed by lamp B and the line from B to Xiaogang. 

But without knowing more about the configuration, it's hard to tell. 

However, the problem mentions that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of street lamp B. This suggests that the line from his head to the base of lamp B is horizontal, which would mean that the lamp B's base is at his eye level. But since his height is 1.5 meters, that would imply that the lamp's base is at 1.5 meters. But lamp bases are on the ground, so this seems contradictory. 

Wait, unless the lamp B's light is at a certain height, and his head touches the light. But the wording says "the bottom of street lamp B", which is the base, not the light. 

Hmm. Maybe there's a misunderstanding in the translation. Perhaps it means that the top of his head aligns with the bottom of the lamp's light? If the lamp's light is at a certain height, then the line from his eye to the lamp's light would create similar triangles. 

Assuming that, then we can model it as follows: 

Let’s say the lamp B has a light at height H. When Xiaogang stands 25 meters from A and 5 meters from B, the line from his eye level (at 1.5 meters) to the light of lamp B passes through his head. So, the vertical distance from his eye to the light is H - 1.5 meters, and the horizontal distance is 5 meters. 

Meanwhile, if there's another triangle involving lamp A's height, but we don't know it. However, maybe the lamp A's height is irrelevant, and the problem is only about lamp B. 

Wait, but the problem says that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of lamp B. If the lamp B is vertical, then its bottom is at ground level. So, if his head touches the bottom of lamp B, that would mean his head is at ground level, which conflicts with his height. So this suggests that the problem might have a different configuration. 

Another possibility: The street lamps are vertical, and when Xiaogang walks from A to B, the line from the top of his head to the top of lamp B is such that it passes through the base of lamp B. Wait, that would mean the line goes from his head (height 1.5) to the top of lamp B (height H), passing through the base of lamp B (ground level). So, the line from his head to the top of lamp B intersects the ground at lamp B's base. 

In that case, we can use similar triangles. 

The line from his head to the top of lamp B forms a triangle with the base of lamp B. 

The vertical distance from his head to the top of lamp B is H - 1.5 meters. The horizontal distance from him to lamp B is 5 meters. 

But also, the line from his head to the top of lamp B would intersect the ground at lamp B's base. So, the entire triangle formed by the lamp B's height and the horizontal distance from him to B. 

Wait, but that would mean that the line from his head to the top of lamp B creates a right triangle with legs of (H - 1.5) and 5 meters. 

But how does this help us find H? We need more information. 

Alternatively, if there's another triangle involving lamp A. For example, if lamp A's height is h_A, then the line from the top of lamp A to the top of lamp B would form a triangle. But without knowing h_A, this might not help. 

Wait, but the problem includes predicates about similar triangles. The Similar(Triangle(A,$1,$2),Triangle($3,$4,$5)) suggests that there are similar triangles in the diagram. 

Looking back at the predicates, there's a Triangle(A,$1,$2), which could be a triangle involving points A, $1, and $2. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(A,$,$1)) and RightAngle(Angle(B,$,$2)). 

This suggests that at points $ and $2, there are right angles. So, maybe the lines from A-$ and B-$ are perpendicular to some other line. 

Assuming that Line($) is a common perpendicular to both A-$ and B-$, making those lines horizontal. So, if Line($) is vertical, then A-$ and B-$ are horizontal lines. 

Thus, the setup is: 

- Point A is connected to point $ via a horizontal line of length 25.0 meters. 

- Point B is connected to point $ via a horizontal line of length 30.0 meters. 

Wait, no, the Line($,$2) is 30.0, so if $ is one point, and $2 is another, then the distance between $ and $2 is 30.0 meters. 

And the line from A to $ is 25.0 meters. 

So, if we imagine point $ as the point where Xiaogang is standing, then the distance from A to $ is 25.0 meters, and from $ to $2 is 30.0 meters. But the problem says that Xiaogang walked 25.0 meters from A to B, which is 30.0 meters. So, the total distance between A and B is 30.0 meters, and he walked 25.0 meters, so the remaining distance is 5.0 meters. 

Therefore, point $ is 25.0 meters from A and 5.0 meters from B. 

Now, considering that there is a line from $1 to $ with length 1.5 meters. And Line(A,$) is parallel to Line($1,$). Also, both are perpendicular to Line($). 

So, Line($) is vertical, Line(A,$) and Line($1,$) are horizontal. Thus, $1 is a point such that the line from $1 to $ is horizontal, with length 1.5 meters. 

Therefore, the line $1-$ is horizontal, and its length is 1.5 meters. This could represent Xiaogang's height, as he is standing at point $, and the line from $1 to $ represents his height. 

So, if we consider the triangle formed by A, $1, and $2, which is Triangle(A,$1,$2). And since there's a similarity to another triangle. 

But how does this help us find the height of lamp B? 

Assuming that lamp B is at point $2, which is 30.0 meters from point $, and the line from $ to $2 is horizontal. 

If we consider the triangle formed by A, $1, and $2. Since Line(A,$) is horizontal (length 25.0) and Line($1,$) is horizontal (length 1.5), and Line($,$2) is horizontal (length 30.0). Wait, but if all three lines are horizontal, then the triangle A,$1,$2 would be degenerate, as all points would be colinear. That doesn't make sense. 

Ah, perhaps the lines are not all horizontal. Let me re-examine the perpendicularity. 

It says that Line(A,$) is perpendicular to Line($), and Line($1,$) is also perpendicular to Line($). So, Line($) is a common perpendicular to both Line(A,$) and Line($1,$). 

If Line($) is vertical, then Line(A,$) and Line($1,$) are horizontal. 

So, point A is at (x, y), point $ is at (x + 25, y), since Line(A,$) is horizontal and length 25. 

Point $1 is somewhere such that Line($1,$) is horizontal and has length 1.5. So, if $ is at (x + 25, y), then $1 could be at (x + 25 + 1.5, y) or (x + 25 - 1.5, y). 

Then, Line($,$2) has length 30.0. Since Line($) is vertical, point $2 must be vertically aligned with $, so if Line($) is vertical, then $2 is along the vertical line passing through $. 

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should assign coordinates. 

Let me set up a coordinate system. Let’s assume that Line($) is the y-axis. So, point $ is at (0, 0). 

Since Line(A,$) is perpendicular to Line($), and Line($) is the y-axis, then Line(A,$) must be horizontal. So, point A is at (-25, 0), since the length from A to $ is 25.0 meters. 

Similarly, Line($1,$) is also perpendicular to Line($), so it is horizontal. The length of Line($1,$) is 1.5, so point $1 is either at (1.5, 0) or (-1.5, 0). But since Xiaogang is walking from A to B, and the distance between A and B is 30.0 meters, which is Line($,$2) of length 30.0. Since Line($) is the y-axis, point $2 must be along the y-axis? No, wait, Line($,$2) is a line between $ and $2. If Line($) is the y-axis, then $ is at (0,0), and Line($,$2) is a line from (0,0) to $2. The length is 30.0, so point $2 is at (0, 30.0) or (0,-30.0). But since the problem mentions that Xiaogang walked from A to B, and the distance between A and B is 30.0, then B is at $2. 

So, assuming that $2 is at (0,30.0), making Line($,$2) vertical. Wait, but earlier we said Line($) is the y-axis, so if $2 is on the y-axis, then Line($,$2) is vertical. But earlier, Line(A,$) is horizontal, and Line($1,$) is horizontal. 

Now, the distance between A and B is 30.0 meters. Point A is at (-25, 0), point B is at (0, 30.0). Wait, the distance between A(-25,0) and B(0,30) is sqrt((25)^2 + (30)^2) ≈ 39.05 meters, which contradicts the given 30.0 meters. So this assumption is incorrect. 

Alternatively, if $2 is at (30, 0), then the distance from A(-25,0) to B(30,0) is 55 meters, which is also not matching. 

Hmm, this suggests my coordinate setup is flawed. Let me rethink. 

Given that Line($,$2) has length 30.0, and Line(A,$) has length 25.0. Also, the Sub(LengthOf(Line($,$2)),LengthOf(Line(A,$)),5.0) means that 30.0 - 25.0 = 5.0. This suggests that the distance between $ and $2 is 30.0, and the distance between A and $ is 25.0, so the remaining distance from $ to $2 is 5.0. 

Wait, this implies that the distance from A to $2 is 25.0 + 5.0 = 30.0. So, A to $ is 25.0, $ to $2 is 5.0, totaling 30.0. So, A, $, and $2 are collinear, with A---$---$2, where A to $ is 25.0, $ to $2 is 5.0. 

So, if I place A at (0,0), $ at (25,0), and $2 at (30,0). Then, the line from A to $ is 25 units long, and from $ to $2 is 5 units. 

Now, Line($) is a line that is perpendicular to Line(A,$) and Line($1,$). Since Line(A,$) is horizontal (from (0,0) to (25,0)), then Line($) must be vertical. So, Line($) is vertical, passing through point $. 

Wait, but Line($) is a line, not necessarily passing through $ itself. Wait, the Line(A,$) is a line from A to $. The Line($) is another line. Wait, the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(A,$,$1)), which means at point $, the angle between lines A-$ and $-$1 is a right angle. So, the lines A-$ and $-$1 meet at $ and form a right angle. 

Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(B,$,$2)) means at point $, the angle between lines B-$ and $-$2 is a right angle. 

So, at point $, there are two lines: one from A to $, and another from $ to $1, forming a right angle. Also, another line from B to $, and from $ to $2, forming another right angle. 

This suggests that at point $, there are two perpendicular lines: one going from A to $, and another going from $ to $1; and another going from B to $, and another from $ to $2. 

But since Line(A,$) is from A to $, which is horizontal (as per previous setup), then the line $-$1 must be vertical (since it's perpendicular to A-$). Similarly, the line $-$2 must be vertical as well? Or perpendicular to B-$?

Wait, the second RightAngle(Angle(B,$,$2)) implies that at point $, the lines B-$ and $-$2 form a right angle. So, if B-$ is a line from B to $, and $-$2 is another line from $ to $2, forming a right angle. 

But we already have Line(A,$) as horizontal, and Line($-$1) as vertical. So, if B is located such that line B-$ is horizontal, then line $-$2 would be vertical. 

But this depends on the positioning of B. 

Let me try to define coordinates. Let's assume point $ is at (25,0). 

Line(A,$) is from A to $, which is horizontal, so A is at (0,0), $ is at (25,0). 

At point $, there's a right angle between A-$ and $-$1. So, $-$1 is perpendicular to A-$, which is horizontal, so $-$1 is vertical. Therefore, point $1 is somewhere along the vertical line passing through $, i.e., x=25. 

The length of Line($1,$) is 1.5, so since it's vertical, moving up or down from $ (25,0), point $1 is at (25, 1.5) or (25, -1.5). Assuming it's upwards, $1 is at (25, 1.5). 

Now, Line($,$2) has length 30.0. From point $ (25,0), the line to $2 has length 30.0. Also, there is a RightAngle(Angle(B,$,$2)), which means at point $, the lines B-$ and $-$2 form a right angle. 

If line B-$ is horizontal, then line $-$2 must be vertical. But since Line($,$2) is a line from $ to $2, which is length 30.0. If $-$2 is vertical, then $2 is at (25, 30) or (25, -30). 

But we also need to account for the fact that the total distance between A and B is 30.0 meters. Wait, previously, the Line($,$2) is 30.0 meters, and the distance from A to $ is 25.0 meters. So, if A is at (0,0), and $ is at (25,0), then B must be at (30,0), making the distance from A to B 30.0 meters. But then, where is $2? 

If $2 is at (25,30), then the distance from $ to $2 is 30.0 meters. But then, the line B-$ would be from B to $, which is from (30,0) to (25,0), which is horizontal. So, at point $, the lines B-$ (horizontal) and $-$2 (vertical) form a right angle, satisfying the RightAngle condition. 

Now, the problem states that when Xiaogang walked from the bottom of street lamp A (point A) to the bottom of street lamp B (point B), which is 30.0 meters. He walked 25.0 meters, reaching point $, and at this point, the top of his figure just touched the bottom of street lamp B. 

But street lamp B is at point B (30,0), whose bottom is at ground level (y=0). So, if Xiaogang's head touches the bottom of lamp B, which is at (30,0), then his head must be at (30,0). But he is standing at point $ (25,0). How can his head touch the bottom of lamp B at (30,0)? That would require him to be at (30,0), but he is at (25,0). 

This suggests a misunderstanding. Perhaps the lamp B is not at point B, but at point $2. Earlier, we had $2 at (25,30), which is 30.0 meters from $, but the distance from A to B is supposed to be 30.0 meters. 

Wait, if B is at (30,0), then the distance from A (0,0) to B (30,0) is 30.0 meters. The point $ is at (25,0), which is 25.0 meters from A. The line from $ to $2 is 30.0 meters, so $2 is at (25,30). 

Now, the street lamp B is at (30,0), and Xiaogang is at (25,0). When he walks from A (0,0) to B (30,0), he stops at (25,0). At this point, the top of his figure touches the bottom of street lamp B. 

But the bottom of lamp B is at (30,0), which is 5 meters away horizontally. So, how does his head touch the bottom of lamp B? 

Unless the lamp B is at (25,30), which is $2. In that case, the bottom of lamp B is at (25,0), which is where Xiaogang is standing. But that would mean his head is at (25,0), which is ground level. But his height is 1.5 meters, so his head is at 1.5 meters. 

This inconsistency suggests that the lamp B is at point $2, which is (25,30). So, the lamp B is a vertical pole at (25,30), extending upward from the ground. Its bottom is at (25,0), and its top is at (25,30 + height). 

Wait, but the length of Line($,$2) is 30.0 meters, which is the distance from $ (25,0) to $2 (25,30), which is 30.0 meters vertically. So, this would suggest that the lamp B is at (25,30), and its height is 30.0 meters? But the question asks for the height of the street lamp, which would be 30.0 meters, but that's not among the options. 

Alternatively, perhaps the lamp B is at (30,0), and the line from $ to $2 is 30.0 meters. If $ is at (25,0), then $2 could be at (25 + 30*cos(theta), 0 + 30*sin(theta)), but this complicates things. 

Alternatively, maybe the line from $ to $2 is not vertical. Let me think differently. 

If at point $, there are two perpendicular lines: one from A to $ (horizontal), and one from $ to $1 (vertical). Also, another line from B to $, and from $ to $2, forming another right angle. 

Suppose line B-$ is not horizontal. Let's say line B-$ is at some angle, and line $-$2 is perpendicular to it. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

However, the problem mentions that the line from $1 to $ has length 1.5, and that lines A-$ and $1-$ are parallel. Since they are both perpendicular to Line($), which we've assumed is vertical, then A-$ and $1-$ are horizontal. 

So, point $1 is somewhere along the horizontal line from $, at a distance of 1.5 meters. If $ is at (25,0), then $1 is at (25 ± 1.5, 0). 

Assuming $1 is at (26.5, 0), then the line from $1 to $ is horizontal. 

Now, the triangle A,$1,$2 is mentioned. So, points A (0,0), $1 (26.5,0), and $2. What is $2? 

We know that Line($,$2) has length 30.0. If Line($) is vertical, then $2 is along the vertical line through $, so $2 is (25, y), with |y| = 30.0. So, $2 is at (25,30) or (25,-30). 

If we consider the triangle A,$1,$2, it would have vertices at (0,0), (26.5,0), and (25,30). This is a triangle with base from A to $1 (length 26.5 meters), and height from $2 to this base. 

But how does this relate to the problem? 

Perhaps the similar triangles are between this triangle and another triangle. The similar(Triangle(A,$1,$2),Triangle(...)) suggests that there's a similar triangle involved. 

Alternatively, since there's a RightAngle at $ for both angles, maybe we can use similar triangles involving the heights. 

Let me focus on the key part: when Xiaogang is at point $ (25,0), his height is 1.5 meters. The line from his head (at height 1.5) to the top of lamp B (assuming lamp B is at $2, which is (25,30)), would form a vertical line. But this doesn't involve any calculation. 

Wait, if lamp B is at $2 (25,30), then its height is 30.0 meters. But this isn't one of the answer choices. The options are 6,7,8,9 meters. 

This suggests that my current assumptions are incorrect. 

Let me revisit the problem statement. It says that when Xiaogang went straight 25.0 from the bottom of street lamp A to the bottom of street lamp B, he found that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of street lamp B. 

Wait, this suggests that the distance between A and B is 25.0 meters, but the given predicate says LengthOf(Line($,$2))=30.0. This contradiction implies that my initial parsing of the predicates might be wrong. 

Wait, the given predicates include:

LengthOf(Line(A,$))=25.0

LengthOf(Line($,$2))=30.0

Sub(LengthOf(Line($,$2)),LengthOf(Line(A,$)),5.0)

So, 30.0 - 25.0 = 5.0, which suggests that the distance from A to $ is 25.0, and from $ to $2 is 5.0, making the total distance from A to $2 30.0. 

So, the total distance between A and B is 30.0 meters, and Xiaogang walked 25.0 meters from A to $, then 5.0 meters to B. 

But the problem says he went straight 25.0 from A to B, but the actual distance between A and B is 30.0. This suggests that he did not walk directly from A to B, but took a path that is 25.0 meters, possibly not straight? No, the problem says "went straight 25.0 from the bottom of street lamp A to the bottom of street lamp B". This implies that the straight-line distance between A and B is 25.0 meters, but the predicate says LengthOf(Line($,$2))=30.0. This discrepancy indicates that my understanding of the predicates is incorrect. 

Maybe the Line($,$2) is not the straight-line distance between A and B, but another line. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Line($,$2) is the path taken by Xiaogang, which is 30.0 meters, but he walked 25.0 meters, leaving 5.0 meters. 

But this is unclear. Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should focus on the similar triangles approach. 

Assume that the height of the lamp B is H. When Xiaogang is 5 meters away from B, his height is 1.5 meters. The line from his head to the base of lamp B is horizontal, so the line from his head to the base of B is 1.5 meters. But this doesn't help. 

Wait, if the line from the top of his head to the top of lamp B is such that it forms similar triangles with the lamp A. 

But without knowing lamp A's height, this is tricky. 

Wait, but the problem mentions that there are similar triangles. The predicate Similar(Triangle(A,$1,$2),Triangle($3,$4,$5)) suggests that there's a pair of similar triangles. 

If we consider that the triangle formed by lamp A, the distance from A to Xiaogang, and the height of lamp A is similar to the triangle formed by lamp B, the distance from Xiaogang to B, and the height of lamp B. 

Let's denote:

Let h_A be the height of lamp A, h_B the height of lamp B.

Distance from A to Xiaogang: 25.0 meters

Distance from Xiaogang to B: 5.0 meters

If the triangles are similar, then the ratio of heights is equal to the ratio of distances:

h_A / h_B = 25.0 / 5.0 = 5

But we don't know h_A. 

However, if we consider that when Xiaogang is at 25 meters from A, his head is at 1.5 meters, and this forms a similar triangle. 

Wait, perhaps the height of lamp A is related to his height. 

If the line from the top of lamp A to the top of lamp B passes through his head, then we can set up proportions. 

Let me imagine that the line from the top of lamp A to the top of lamp B passes through his head at 1.5 meters. 

The distance from A to his position is 25.0 meters, and from his position to B is 5.0 meters. 

Using similar triangles: 

(h_A - 1.5) / 25.0 = (h_B - 1.5) / 5.0 

But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, if the lamp A's height is h_A, and the line from the top of lamp A to the top of lamp B passes through his head, then:

The slope from A to B is (h_B - h_A) / 30.0 meters. 

At 25.0 meters from A, the height would be h_A + ((h_B - h_A)/30.0)*25.0. 

This height should equal his head height, 1.5 meters. 

So:

h_A + (25/30)(h_B - h_A) = 1.5 

Simplify:

h_A*(1 - 25/30) + (25/30)*h_B = 1.5 

h_A*(5/30) + (25/30)*h_B = 1.5 

Multiply both sides by 30:

5h_A + 25h_B = 45 

Divide by 5:

h_A + 5h_B = 9 

But we have one equation with two variables. Need another relation. 

If we assume that the lamp A's height is related to his height through similar triangles. For example, if the line from the top of lamp A to his head is parallel to the line from the top of lamp B to his head, but this is not clear. 

Alternatively, if the lamp A's height is such that when he stands at A, his head touches the base of lamp B. But this is not the case. 

Alternatively, if the lamp A's height is 1.5 meters, but that's his height, so unlikely. 

Without additional information, this approach is stuck. 

Let me try to use the given predicates. 

There is a similar triangles predicate: Similar(Triangle(A,$1,$2),Triangle($3,$4,$5)). 

Assuming that this is the similar triangles involved in the problem. 

Let me consider that Triangle(A,$1,$2) is similar to another triangle, possibly involving the lamp heights. 

If I can find the ratio of sides from the similar triangles, I can relate the heights. 

From the given predicates, Line(A,$) is 25.0, Line($,$2) is 30.0, Line($1,$) is 1.5. 

If these lines are sides of the triangles, maybe the ratio of corresponding sides is 25.0/1.5 = 50/3. 

But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, if the triangle A,$1,$2 has sides 25.0, 1.5, and 30.0? No, because those are lengths of lines, not sides of a triangle. 

Wait, the Triangle(A,$1,$2) has vertices at A, $1, and $2. 

If Line(A,$) is 25.0, and Line($1,$) is 1.5, and Line($,$2) is 30.0, then perhaps the sides of the triangle are these lengths. 

But in a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. Let's check: 25 + 1.5 > 30? 26.5 > 30? No. So this cannot be a triangle. Hence, this suggests that these lines are not the sides of the triangle. 

Maybe the sides of the triangle are the lengths between the points. For example, the sides of Triangle(A,$1,$2) are the distances between A and $1, $1 and $2, and $2 and A. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult to calculate. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll switch to the standard similar triangles approach for such problems. 

Typically, in such scenarios, the height of the object (lamp) can be found using similar triangles. 

When Xiaogang is 25 meters from A and 5 meters from B, his height is 1.5 meters. Assuming that the line from his head to the top of lamp B forms a similar triangle with the lamp A. 

Let me assume that the height of lamp B is H. The distance from Xiaogang to B is 5 meters, and his height is 1.5 meters. 

If the line from his head to the top of lamp B creates a right triangle with the lamp B's height and the distance from him to B, then:

(H - 1.5)/5 = h_A / 25 

Where h_A is the height of lamp A. 

But without knowing h_A, this is still two variables. 

However, if the line from the top of lamp A to the top of lamp B passes through his head, then:

The slope from A to B is (H - h_A)/30. 

At 25 meters from A, the height would be h_A + ((H - h_A)/30)*25 = 1.5 

Which gives:

h_A*(1 - 25/30) + (25/30)*H = 1.5 

As before, leading to h_A + 5H = 9 

Still one equation with two variables. 

But if we assume that lamp A's height is zero (unlikely), then 5H = 9 → H = 1.8, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, if there's another condition. 

Wait, the problem says that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of street lamp B. This suggests that the line from his head to the top of lamp B is such that it passes through the base of lamp B. 

If the lamp B is at point B, and his head is at height 1.5, then the line from his head to the top of lamp B would have a slope such that it passes through the base of lamp B. 

Let me model this: 

Let’s assume lamp B is at point B, with height H. Xiaogang is at point X, 25 meters from A and 5 meters from B. His height is 1.5. 

The line from his head (at height 1.5) to the top of lamp B (at height H) passes through the base of lamp B (which is at ground level). 

This forms a triangle: from his head (1.5) to the top of lamp B (H), and from his position to the base of lamp B (5 meters). 

The slope from his head to the top of lamp B is (H - 1.5)/5. 

But this line also passes through the base of lamp B, which is at (B's position). 

Wait, if the line passes through the base of lamp B, then at the base of lamp B, the height is 0. 

So, the line from his head (1.5) to the top of lamp B (H) passes through the base of lamp B (0). 

This means that the line from his head to the top of lamp B passes through the base of lamp B. 

This creates two segments: from his head to the base (length 1.5 meters vertically) and from the base to the top of lamp B (length H meters vertically). 

The horizontal distance from his position to the base is 5 meters. 

So, the slope is (H - 1.5)/5 = (1.5 - 0)/5 ? No, because the line goes from his head (1.5) to the top of lamp B (H), passing through the base (0). 

Wait, the line from his head to the top of lamp B passes through the base of lamp B. So, it's a single line passing through three points: his head (1.5, 0), the base of lamp B (0,0), and the top of lamp B (0, H)? No, because the base of lamp B is at (B_x, 0), and the top is at (B_x, H). 

Wait, if the line from his head (at (X_x, 1.5)) to the top of lamp B (at (B_x, H)) passes through the base of lamp B (at (B_x, 0)), then the slope from his head to the base is (0 - 1.5)/(B_x - X_x) = -1.5/(5) = -0.3. 

The slope from the base to the top is (H - 0)/(0) = undefined (vertical line). This is only possible if the line is vertical, which would mean that X_x = B_x, but he is 5 meters from B, so X_x = B_x - 5. This would require that B_x = X_x + 5. 

But if the line from his head to the top of lamp B is vertical, then the horizontal component is zero, which contradicts the 5 meter distance. 

This suggests that my assumption is wrong. 

Perhaps the line from his head to the top of lamp B is such that it passes through the base of lamp B, creating similar triangles. 

Let me consider the triangle formed by his head, the top of lamp B, and the base of lamp B. 

This is a right triangle with vertical leg (H - 1.5) and horizontal leg 5 meters. 

But without knowing the other dimensions, it's hard to proceed. 

Given that I'm stuck, I'll refer back to the standard similar triangles problem. 

In such problems, the height of the object is often calculated by (distance from object * observer's height) / (distance from observer to object). 

But in this case, if the observer is 25 meters from A and 5 meters from B, and his height is 1.5 meters, and the line of sight to the top of lamp B passes through his head. 

The formula would be: 

Height of lamp B = (observer's height * distance from observer to lamp B) / distance from observer to lamp A 

Wait, no. Let me recall: 

If you have two objects, and you stand between them, the height of the taller object can be calculated using similar triangles. 

But in this case, the observer is between A and B, and the line from his head to the top of B passes through the base of B. 

Wait, this is similar to the problem where a person stands between two posts, and the line of sight from their head to the top of one post passes through the base of the other. 

In such cases, the height of the post can be calculated using similar triangles. 

Let me denote: 

Let h be the height of lamp B. 

The observer is 5 meters from B and 25 meters from A. 

His height is 1.5 meters. 

The line from his head to the top of lamp B passes through the base of lamp B. 

This forms two similar triangles: 

1. The triangle from the observer's eye to the base of lamp B (height 1.5 meters, base 5 meters). 

2. The triangle from the base of lamp B to the top of lamp B (height h, base 0, which is not helpful). 

Wait, this isn't working. 

Alternatively, the line from the observer's head to the top of lamp B creates a triangle with the lamp B and the observer's position. 

The height of lamp B is h, the observer's height is 1.5. The distance from observer to lamp B is 5 meters. 

The line from the observer's head to the top of lamp B is (h - 1.5) meters vertically over 5 meters horizontally. 

This is the same as the slope from the observer's head to the top of lamp B. 

If this line also passes through the base of lamp B, which is at the same horizontal level as the observer's feet, then the vertical drop from the observer's head to the base is 1.5 meters over 5 meters horizontally. 

This would mean that the slope is -1.5/5 = -0.3. 

But this slope would also extend to the top of the lamp B. 

So, from the base of lamp B (which is at 0 vertical), moving up with slope -0.3, we get to the top of lamp B. 

Wait, but the slope is negative, indicating downward, which doesn't make sense. 

I think I'm missing something. 

Let me try one last approach. 

If the top of his head touches the bottom of lamp B, it means that the line from his head to the top of lamp B is such that it passes through the base of lamp B. 

This forms two similar triangles: 

1. Triangle formed by the observer's head, the base of lamp B, and the point directly under the observer's head. 

2. Triangle formed by the top of lamp B, the base of lamp B, and the same point. 

But I'm not seeing the connection. 

Alternatively, the triangle formed by the observer's head, the top of lamp B, and the base of lamp B. This is a right triangle with legs (h - 1.5) and 5 meters. 

But without additional info, I can't solve for h. 

Given that I'm running out of ideas and time, I'll make an educated guess based on standard similar triangles problems. 

In such problems, the height is often calculated as (observer's height * distance to object) / distance from observer to reference point. 

Here, if the observer is 5 meters from B, and 25 meters from A, and his height is 1.5, then:

Height of lamp B = (1.5 * 30) / 25 = 4.5 meters. Not an option. 

Or, if it's (1.5 * 25) / 5 = 7.5 meters. Still not an option. 

Wait, the answer choices are 6,7,8,9. 

If the correct calculation is (1.5 * 30)/5 = 9.0 meters, which is option A. 

But why 30? Because the total distance between A and B is 30 meters. 

If the observer is 25 meters from A and 5 meters from B, and the line from his head to the top of lamp B passes through the base of lamp B, then the triangles are similar with ratio 25:5 = 5:1. 

So, the height of lamp B is 5 times the observer's height: 1.5 * 5 = 7.5. Not an option. 

But if it's 1.5 * (30/5) = 9.0. 

This suggests the answer is 9.0 meters, option A. 

But why 30? Because the total distance between A and B is 30 meters. 

If the observer is 25 meters from A, and 5 meters from B, then the total distance is 30. 

If the line from his head to the top of lamp B is such that it creates similar triangles with the entire distance, then:

Height of lamp B = (1.5 * 30) / 5 = 9.0. 

This would make the answer A:9米.

But I'm not fully confident, but given the options and standard similar triangles, this is plausible.
