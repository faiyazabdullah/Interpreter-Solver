MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right triangle ABC with the right angle at C. The legs AC and BC are 4.0 and 3.0 units long respectively. We need to find the lateral surface area of the solid formed by rotating this triangle around the line AC.

First, I should recall what happens when you rotate a shape around an axis. In this case, rotating triangle ABC around side AC. Since AC is one of the legs, and the right angle is at C, rotating around AC would sweep out a three-dimensional shape. Let me visualize this: point B is connected to C, so when we spin around AC, point B will trace out a circular path. The resulting solid should be like a cone, right? Because the hypotenuse AB would form the slant height of the cone, and the base radius would be the length of BC.

Wait, but let me confirm. When you rotate a right triangle around one of its legs, it forms a cone. The leg around which you're rotating becomes the height of the cone, and the other leg becomes the radius of the base. Then, the hypotenuse becomes the slant height. But here, we're rotating around AC, which is one of the legs. So AC is the height (h) of the cone, and BC is the radius (r). The hypotenuse AB would be the slant height (l).

But wait, the question asks for the lateral surface area of the rotating body. The formula for the lateral (or curved) surface area of a cone is πrl, where r is the radius and l is the slant height. Let me check if that applies here.

So, first, confirm the dimensions. Given AC = 4.0 (height h), BC = 3.0 (radius r). The hypotenuse AB can be found using Pythagoras: sqrt(AC² + BC²) = sqrt(16 + 9) = sqrt(25) = 5.0. Therefore, the slant height l is 5.0.

Then, lateral surface area would be π * r * l = π * 3 * 5 = 15π. That would correspond to answer choice B. But let me make sure there isn't another way to interpret the rotation.

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding about which part is being rotated? For example, if the triangle is rotated around AC, then each point of the triangle traces a circle. The side BC is perpendicular to AC since it's a right triangle at C. So, when rotating around AC, the segment BC would form a circle with radius BC (which is 3.0). The hypotenuse AB would form the slant height. Hence, the lateral surface area is indeed πrl = π*3*5=15π. So answer B.

Wait, but maybe there's more to it? Like, does the entire triangle contribute to the surface area, including the base? But the question specifies the lateral area, which typically excludes the base. So yes, just the curved surface. Therefore, the answer should be 15π, which is option B.
