MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the midline equation of a trigonometric function. The given information includes a minimum point at (1, 1.5) and an amplitude of 1.5. 

First, I need to recall what the midline of a trigonometric function is. From what I remember, the midline is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the function's oscillations. For sine and cosine functions, the midline is usually the average of the maximum and minimum values. The amplitude is the distance from the midline to either the maximum or minimum point. 

So, if the amplitude is 1.5, that means the function oscillates 1.5 units above and below the midline. The minimum point given is (1, 1.5). Since the amplitude is 1.5, the maximum point should be 1.5 units above the midline, and the minimum is 1.5 units below. Wait, but here the minimum y-value is 1.5. Let me think again.

Let me denote the midline as y = k. Then, the maximum value would be k + amplitude, and the minimum would be k - amplitude. But here, the minimum is at y=1.5. So, substituting, we have:

Minimum value = k - amplitude = 1.5

Given that amplitude is 1.5, so:

k - 1.5 = 1.5

Solving for k gives k = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3. Therefore, the midline equation is y = 3. 

Wait, but let me check if there's another way. Maybe the midline is determined by the vertical shift. In general, a sinusoidal function can be written as y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, where D is the vertical shift, which is also the midline. The amplitude is |A|. So, since the amplitude is given as 1.5, then A = ±1.5. The minimum value occurs when sin(Bx + C) is -1, so the minimum y-value is D - |A|. Here, the minimum is 1.5, so:

D - 1.5 = 1.5 → D = 3. Hence, the midline is y = 3. 

Therefore, the midline equation is y = 3. Now, checking the given points. The minimum point is (1, 1.5), which fits because when x=1, the function reaches its minimum. The midline is horizontal, so it's just y=3 regardless of x. 

But wait, the problem mentions a graph of a trigonometric function. The midline is horizontal, so the equation is simply y equals some constant. The answer choices aren't listed, but the user mentioned they're not found. However, according to my calculation, the midline is y=3. So if the options included y=3, that's the answer. Since the answer choices aren't provided, maybe the system expects me to infer based on the given data. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's confusion between the coordinates. The minimum point is at (1, 1.5). The midline is horizontal, so it's y = something. The amplitude is 1.5, so the vertical distance from midline to min is 1.5. So midline is 1.5 units above the minimum. Thus, midline y-coordinate is 1.5 + 1.5 = 3. Therefore, midline equation is y=3. 

I think that's solid. So the answer should be y=3. Since the answer choices weren't provided, but the user said to select the correct one, assuming that one of them is y=3, then Final Answer: A or whatever corresponds to that. But since the original problem didn't list options, maybe the user made a mistake? Anyway, based on the info, the midline is y=3.
