QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a scaled version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

CHOICES:
No choices found.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two functions, f and g. The question says that function f is a parabola y = x², and function g is a scaled version of f. We need to find the equation for g(x). 

First, I'll look at the given predicates. The point Origin is (0,0), and Point P is (2,3). There are some lines mentioned, like Line(Origin, (1,0)) which is the x-axis, and Line(Origin, (0,1)) which is the y-axis. These lines are perpendicular, which makes sense because the axes are perpendicular. Also, the origin lies on both these lines.

Now, the shapes f and g are parabolas. The predicate says that f is a parabola, and so is g. Both pass through the origin. Additionally, point P (2,3) lies on shape g. 

Since f is given as y = x², which is a standard upward-opening parabola with vertex at the origin. Now, g is a scaled version of f. Scaling could mean vertical scaling, horizontal scaling, or both. But since it's mentioned as a scaled version, maybe it's just vertical scaling? Wait, but if it's a vertical scaling, then the general form would be y = kx². However, we also know that the origin is on both f and g, which is already satisfied here. But point P (2,3) is on g. Let's check that.

Suppose g(x) = kx². Then plugging in x=2, we get y = k*(2)^2 = 4k. This should equal 3, so 4k = 3 → k = 3/4. Therefore, the equation would be y = (3/4)x². But wait, let me confirm if there's more to it. Are there other possibilities for scaling?

Alternatively, scaling could involve horizontal scaling. For example, if we horizontally scale the function, it would be y = (x/a)², which simplifies to y = x²/a². But that's equivalent to vertical scaling by a factor of 1/a². However, depending on how the scaling is applied. But the problem states that g is a scaled version of f, which is y=x². Since the original function f is y=x², and g is a scaled version, perhaps they mean either vertical or horizontal scaling. However, without knowing the direction of scaling, but given that the point (2,3) lies on g, we can use that to find the scaling factor.

But another possibility is that the scaling could be combined with reflection. However, the problem doesn't mention reflections, so probably just scaling. Let's stick with vertical scaling first. Using the point (2,3):

For g(x) = kx², plug in x=2, y=3: 3 = k*(2)^2 ⇒ k=3/4. So the equation would be y=(3/4)x². Alternatively, if there was a horizontal scaling, say replacing x with x/a, then the equation becomes y = (x/a)^2. Then, plugging in x=2, y=3 gives 3 = (2/a)^2 ⇒ 2/a = sqrt(3) ⇒ a = 2/sqrt(3). Then the equation would be y = (x/(2/sqrt(3)))^2 = (sqrt(3)/2 x)^2 = (3/4)x². Wait, that's the same as before! So regardless of whether the scaling is horizontal or vertical, the resulting equation ends up being y = (3/4)x². Because horizontal scaling by a factor of a leads to vertical scaling by 1/a². So in this case, both approaches give the same result. Hence, the equation for g(x) is y = (3/4)x².

Let me verify again. Suppose the scaling factor is k. If it's vertical scaling, then the equation is y = kx². With point (2,3): 3 = k*4 ⇒ k=3/4. So yes. If it's horizontal scaling, then the equation is y = (x/h)^2. Plugging (2,3): 3 = (2/h)^2 ⇒ h = 2/sqrt(3). Then the equation is y = (x / (2/sqrt(3)))^2 = (sqrt(3)/2 x)^2 = (3/4)x². Same result. Therefore, regardless of the type of scaling, the equation ends up being y = (3/4)x². 

So the answer should be y = (3/4)x², which is equivalent to g(x) = (3/4)x². Thus, the correct equation for g(x) is y = (3/4)x². 

Looking back at the answer choices, even though they aren't listed here, but according to the problem statement, the user hasn't provided options, but the instruction says to pick one of A-D. However, since the assistant isn't given options, but the original problem mentions "Answer Choices: No choices found." So perhaps the answer is supposed to be written as per the derivation. But according to the instructions, the assistant must choose between A-D. Since the actual answer isn't provided, but the process leads us to the conclusion that the equation is y = (3/4)x². Assuming that the answer choices include this, but since they aren't given, the assistant must proceed as per the instructions. However, since the user's message indicates that the answer choices are not present, but the system requires selecting A-D, perhaps there's an error. But following the initial setup, the answer is y = (3/4)x². However, the problem may require expressing it differently. For instance, if the scaling is horizontal, maybe the equation is y = (x^2)/(4/3) which is same as above. 

In any case, the answer is y = (3/4)x², which would correspond to option C if, for example, the choices were ordered as A: y = x², B: y = 2x², C: y = (3/4)x², D: y = something else. But without seeing the actual options, the assistant has to assume that the correct answer is the one derived here. Since the problem says "Write the equation for g(x)" and the answer choices aren't shown, but the user's instruction says to choose among A-D. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is option C. But since the actual answer isn't provided, the assistant must rely on the calculation. However, the problem says "Answer Choices: No choices found." So maybe the answer is simply the equation, but the user expects the assistant to output the correct answer as per the given options. But since no options are given, the assistant must proceed as per the instructions. 

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user wrote "Write the equation for g(x)." and then the answer choices are "No choices found." So perhaps the user intended to provide options but forgot. In such cases, the assistant should still follow the instructions and provide the correct answer. But since the final answer must be one of A-D, and the actual answer isn't given, the assistant must infer. However, given the way the problem is structured, the answer is likely y = (3/4)x². If the answer options included this, then the correct choice would be the corresponding letter. Since the user didn't provide options, but the system requires choosing between A-D, perhaps the answer is C. But without knowing the options, it's impossible to be certain. However, based on the reasoning, the correct equation is y = (3/4)x², so assuming that this corresponds to option C, the Final Answer would be C. But since I don't have access to the actual options, this is speculative. However, given the constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is represented by option C.
