MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the given setup based on the predicates provided. So, there's a circle with center O, and points A, B, C lying on the circle since they're mentioned as being on the circle. Also, OA, OB, and OC are radii because they are lines from the center to the circumference. 

Now, the problem mentions that chord BC intersects radius OA at point D. Additionally, we have some perpendicularity: Line AD is perpendicular to BC. Also, angle ADC is 90 degrees. There's also mention of triangle OAC being isosceles with OA and OC equal, which makes sense since they're both radii. Also, angle A is given as 60 degrees, which probably refers to angle OAC or something similar? Wait, the MeasureOf(Angle(A))=60.0. But Angle(A) could refer to angle at point A? Or maybe angle at point O?

Wait, in the predicates, there's a Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), etc. Then, the MeasureOf(Angle(A))=60.0. Hmm. So angle A is likely angle at point A. Let me think. Since O is the center, OA and OC are radii. Triangle OAC is isosceles with OA=OC, so angles at A and C should be equal? Wait, but the given measure of angle A is 60 degrees. Wait, if triangle OAC is isosceles with OA=OC, then the base angles would be at A and C. Wait, but OA and OC are sides, so vertex at O. Therefore, angles at A and C would be equal. But the measure of angle A is given as 60 degrees. So angle at A (OAC?) is 60 degrees. Then angle at C would also be 60 degrees, making the third angle at O equal to 60 degrees as well, making it an equilateral triangle. Wait, but OA=OC, so triangle OAC is isosceles. If angle at A is 60 degrees, then angle at O would be 180-2*60=60 degrees. So all angles are 60, hence equilateral. That means OA=OC=AC. So AC is equal to the radius? Wait, but AC is a chord of the circle. In an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, the side length equals the radius times sqrt(3)? Wait, maybe not. Let me recall. For a regular hexagon, each side is equal to the radius. But here, triangle OAC is equilateral if all angles are 60 degrees. So OA=OC=AC. But OA and OC are radii, so AC would be equal to the radius. However, AC is a chord of the circle. The length of chord AC can be found via formula 2R sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. Here, if triangle OAC is equilateral, the central angle at O is 60 degrees, so chord length AC would be 2R sin(30°)= R. Which matches OA=OC=R. So that checks out.

But how does this relate to the rest of the problem? We have point D where BC intersects OA, and AD is perpendicular to BC. Also, angle ADC is 90 degrees. So point D lies on OA and BC, and AD ⊥ BC. Also, since AD is perpendicular to BC, triangle ADC is right-angled at D. Given that, perhaps we can use some right triangle properties or circle theorems.

Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally. Circle O, points A, B, C on circumference. OA is a radius. Chord BC intersects OA at D, with AD perpendicular to BC. Also, angle ADC is 90 degrees. Also, angle at A (maybe angle OAB or something else) is 60 degrees. Wait, the MeasureOf(Angle(A))=60.0. Maybe angle OAB? Because OA is a radius, AB is another line. Wait, but AB isn't necessarily a radius. Wait, the problem says connect AB and OC. So AB is connected. But in the given predicates, there's a Line(A,D). So D is on OA and BC. Also, PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(O,A)) and PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(B,C)). So D is the intersection of OA and BC. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,D),Line(B,C)), so AD ⊥ BC.

Given that, triangle ADC has a right angle at D. So triangle ADC is right-angled at D. Also, since BC is a chord of the circle, and AD is perpendicular to BC, then AD passes through the midpoint of BC? Wait, no, unless AD is the perpendicular bisector. But since D is the intersection of OA and BC, unless OA is the perpendicular bisector of BC. But OA is a radius; unless BC is such that its midpoint lies on OA. But we don't know yet. However, since AD is perpendicular to BC and D lies on OA, maybe OA is the perpendicular bisector of BC. But that would mean that OA passes through the midpoint of BC. But if that were true, then BD=DC. However, without knowing more about BC's position, maybe we can derive relations.

Also, note that OA is a radius, so OD + DA = OA. Let me denote OA as r (radius). Let me assign variables. Let’s assume OA = OC = OB = r. Let me consider coordinates. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me place point O at origin (0,0). Let me suppose that OA is along the x-axis. So point A is at (r, 0). Since triangle OAC is equilateral, angle at O is 60 degrees. So point C would be located at 60 degrees from OA. So coordinates of C can be (r cos 60°, r sin 60°) = (r*(1/2), r*(√3/2)). Now, point B is another point on the circle. But we need to find coordinates of B such that BC intersects OA at D, with AD perpendicular to BC.

Alternatively, since BC is a chord passing through D on OA, and AD is perpendicular to BC. So slope of BC is negative reciprocal of slope of AD. Let me attempt coordinates.

Let me fix coordinates. Let’s take O at (0,0), A at (1,0) (assuming unit circle for simplicity). Then point C is at (cos 60°, sin 60°) = (0.5, √3/2). Now, point B is somewhere on the circle. Let me parametrize point B. Let’s say angle for point B is θ radians from positive x-axis. So coordinates of B are (cosθ, sinθ).

Then chord BC connects points B(cosθ, sinθ) and C(0.5, √3/2). The equation of line BC can be found. Let me compute the equation of line BC. The slope of BC is (y_C - y_B)/(x_C - x_B) = [(√3/2 - sinθ)] / [0.5 - cosθ]. The line AD is perpendicular to BC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal. Since AD is along OA, which is the x-axis from O(0,0) to A(1,0). Wait, but D is on OA, so AD is part of OA. Wait, OA is from O(0,0) to A(1,0). So line OA is the x-axis. Therefore, AD is along the x-axis. Therefore, line AD is horizontal (since OA is horizontal). Therefore, line BC must be vertical if AD is horizontal and they are perpendicular. Wait, but AD is along OA, which is horizontal. Therefore, line BC is perpendicular to AD, so BC is vertical. Hence, line BC is vertical. Therefore, the line BC must be vertical. Therefore, the x-coordinate of points B and C must be the same. Wait, but point C has x-coordinate 0.5. Therefore, point B must also have x-coordinate 0.5. Therefore, point B is (0.5, y), where y is determined by the circle. Since B is on the circle centered at O(0,0) with radius 1, so x^2 + y^2 = 1. Therefore, x=0.5, so (0.5)^2 + y^2 = 1 → y² = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 → y = ±√(3)/2 ≈ ±0.866. But point C is already at (0.5, √3/2), so point B would be (0.5, -√3/2) to make BC vertical. Therefore, points B and C are symmetric over the x-axis. Thus, BC is vertical line x=0.5, connecting (0.5, √3/2) and (0.5, -√3/2). Then, the line BC is vertical, and OA is horizontal. Their intersection D is at (0.5, 0). Therefore, point D is (0.5, 0). But OA is from (0,0) to (1,0). So D is at (0.5,0), which is midpoint of OA. Wait, but OA is from O(0,0) to A(1,0), so midpoint is (0.5,0). So D coincides with midpoint of OA. But according to the problem, AD is perpendicular to BC, which in this case holds since BC is vertical and AD is horizontal. Also, angle ADC is 90 degrees. Let me check that. Point D is (0.5,0), point C is (0.5, √3/2), and point A is (1,0). So angle ADC is the angle at D between points A, D, C. So vectors DA and DC. Vector DA goes from D(0.5,0) to A(1,0): (0.5, 0). Vector DC goes from D(0.5,0) to C(0.5, √3/2): (0, √3/2). These two vectors are perpendicular since their dot product is (0.5)(0) + (0)(√3/2) = 0. So yes, angle ADC is 90 degrees. Perfect, that satisfies the given conditions. 

So in this configuration, what is the measure of angle C? Wait, the question asks for the degree of angle C. But angle C could refer to different things. In the problem statement, it says "the degree of angle C". Typically, in a triangle, angle C would be the angle at point C. But depending on context, it might refer to angle at point C in triangle ABC or triangle OBC or something else. Let me check the problem again.

The problem states: "Connect AB and OC. If angle A = 60.0, angle ADC = 90.0, then the degree of angle C is ()" 

So angle A is given as 60 degrees. Assuming angle A refers to angle at point A in triangle ABC or something. But earlier, we considered angle at A in triangle OAC was 60 degrees. However, in our coordinate system, triangle OAC is equilateral with all angles 60 degrees. But the problem may be referring to angle BAC or something else. Wait, the MeasureOf(Angle(A))=60.0. If A is a point, then angle A would be the angle at point A. So angle at point A. So in triangle ABC, angle at A. Let me clarify.

In our setup, point A is (1,0), point B is (0.5, -√3/2), point C is (0.5, √3/2). So triangle ABC has vertices at A(1,0), B(0.5,-√3/2), and C(0.5, √3/2). Let me calculate angle at A. To find angle at A, we can compute the angle between AB and AC.

First, vector AB is from A to B: (0.5 - 1, -√3/2 - 0) = (-0.5, -√3/2)

Vector AC is from A to C: (0.5 - 1, √3/2 - 0) = (-0.5, √3/2)

The angle between vectors AB and AC can be found using the dot product:

cosθ = (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|)

Compute AB · AC: (-0.5)(-0.5) + (-√3/2)(√3/2) = 0.25 - (3/4) = -0.5

|AB| = sqrt( (-0.5)^2 + (-√3/2)^2 ) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.75) = sqrt(1) = 1

Similarly, |AC| is also 1. So cosθ = -0.5 / (1*1) = -0.5. Therefore, θ = arccos(-0.5) = 120 degrees. But the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(A))=60.0. This contradicts our current setup. Wait, this suggests a mistake in my assumption.

Hmm, this indicates that my previous assumption about the location of point B might be wrong. Because according to the problem, angle A is 60 degrees, but in this scenario, it came out as 120 degrees. So there's an error here. Where did I go wrong?

Let me re-examine the problem. The problem says MeasureOf(Angle(A))=60.0. So angle at point A is 60 degrees. In my coordinate setup, that angle came out as 120 degrees. Therefore, my initial assumption about the placement of points might be incorrect.

Perhaps angle A refers to a different angle. Let me check the original predicates again. The given predicates include Isosceles(Triangle(O,A,C)), which implies that triangle OAC is isosceles with OA=OC. Since OA and OC are radii, that's always true. Also, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(O,A,C)),MeasureOf(Angle(O,C,A))). So angles at A and C in triangle OAC are equal. Earlier, I thought these angles were 60 degrees each, leading to an equilateral triangle. But if angle at A (in triangle OAC) is 60 degrees, then angle OAC is 60 degrees. But in the problem, MeasureOf(Angle(A))=60.0. If angle A refers to angle OAC, then that's okay. But in that case, angle OAC is 60 degrees, which in my coordinate system, with O at (0,0), A at (1,0), and C at (0.5, √3/2), then angle OAC is indeed 60 degrees. Wait, let me verify.

In triangle OAC, OA and OC are both radii of length 1. So triangle OAC is isosceles with OA=OC. The angle at O is angle AOC. What is that angle? In my coordinate system, point O is at (0,0), A at (1,0), C at (0.5, √3/2). The angle at O between OA and OC is the angle between vectors OA (along x-axis) and OC (pointing to 60 degrees). So angle AOC is 60 degrees. Therefore, triangle OAC has angles at O: 60 degrees, and angles at A and C equal. Sum of angles is 180, so angles at A and C are (180 - 60)/2 = 60 degrees each. So triangle OAC is equilateral. Therefore, angle OAC is 60 degrees. So MeasureOf(Angle(A)) refers to angle OAC, which is 60 degrees. That aligns with the given condition. However, when I computed the angle at A in triangle ABC, I got 120 degrees. So that angle is different. So the problem's angle A refers to angle OAC, not angle BAC. So that's clarified.

Therefore, the problem is asking for angle C, which could be angle at point C in triangle OAC, or angle at point C in triangle ABC, or another angle. Need to clarify.

The question says: "then the degree of angle C is ()". In the context of the problem, since angle A is specified, angle C is likely referring to angle at point C in triangle ABC. Alternatively, maybe angle at point C in triangle OBC or something else. But let's see.

Given that, let's proceed with the coordinate system. Points:

O(0,0), A(1,0), C(0.5, √3/2), B(0.5, -√3/2). So BC is vertical line x=0.5, from (0.5, -√3/2) to (0.5, √3/2). Intersection D is at (0.5,0), midpoint of OA. Now, what is angle C? If angle C refers to angle at point C in triangle ABC, then we can calculate that. Let me compute angle at point C in triangle ABC.

Points A(1,0), B(0.5,-√3/2), C(0.5, √3/2). So angle at C is the angle between CB and CA.

Vectors from C to B and from C to A:

CB vector: B - C = (0.5 - 0.5, -√3/2 - √3/2) = (0, -√3)

CA vector: A - C = (1 - 0.5, 0 - √3/2) = (0.5, -√3/2)

To find angle between vectors CB and CA. Let's compute the dot product.

Dot product: (0)(0.5) + (-√3)(-√3/2) = 0 + (3/2) = 3/2

Magnitude of CB: sqrt(0² + (-√3)^2) = sqrt(3)

Magnitude of CA: sqrt(0.5² + (√3/2)^2) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.75) = sqrt(1) = 1

Thus, cos(theta) = (3/2) / (sqrt(3)*1) = (3/2)/sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866. Therefore, theta = 30 degrees. Because cos(30°) = √3/2. So angle at point C in triangle ABC is 30 degrees. Which corresponds to choice C (30°). But wait, let me confirm that this is what the question is asking for.

The question says "angle C is", and in the problem's context, since angle A was given as 60 degrees, angle C likely refers to angle at point C in triangle ABC, which we just calculated as 30 degrees. Therefore, the answer would be C (30°). 

But let me double-check if there's another interpretation. Suppose angle C refers to angle OCA in triangle OAC. That angle is 60 degrees, but that's already given as angle A. So no. Or angle at point C in triangle OBC? Let's see. Point O(0,0), B(0.5,-√3/2), C(0.5, √3/2). So triangle OBC. Angle at C would be between OC and BC. Vector CO is from C to O: (-0.5, -√3/2). Vector CB is from C to B: (0, -√3). Dot product between CO and CB: (-0.5)(0) + (-√3/2)(-√3) = 0 + (3/2) = 3/2. Magnitude of CO: sqrt( (-0.5)^2 + (-√3/2)^2 ) = sqrt(0.25 + 0.75) = 1. Magnitude of CB is sqrt(0 + (√3)^2) = sqrt(3). So cos(theta) = (3/2)/(1*sqrt(3)) = same as before, sqrt(3)/2, so theta=30 degrees. So angle at C in triangle OBC is also 30 degrees. So either way, angle C is 30 degrees. 

Therefore, regardless of which triangle, angle at C is 30 degrees. Hence, the answer is C (30°).
