MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a sector of paper with a central angle of 120 degrees and radius 6.0 units. We need to roll it into a conical bottomless cap and find the bottom perimeter. The options are multiples of π, so probably involves circumference calculations.

First, understanding the setup. When you roll a sector into a cone, the radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Wait, but here they mention it's a bottomless cap, so maybe just the lateral surface? But the perimeter they're asking about would be the circumference of the base of the cone, right?

So, the original sector has radius 6.0, which becomes the slant height (l) of the cone. The arc length of the sector is the length around the curved edge, which when formed into a cone becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Therefore, the perimeter (circumference) of the bottom of the cap is equal to the arc length of the sector.

Let me confirm. The formula for the arc length of a sector is θ/360 × 2πr, where θ is the central angle in degrees and r is the radius. Here, θ is 120°, and r is 6.0. So arc length = (120/360) × 2π×6. Simplifying, that's (1/3) × 12π = 4π. So the circumference of the base of the cone is 4π. Hence, the bottom perimeter should be 4π cm. Looking at the options, that's option C.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The sector's arc length becomes the circumference of the base. Yes, because when you form the cone, the two straight edges of the sector meet, and the arc becomes the circumference. So yes, the arc length equals the base circumference. So calculation gives 4π. So answer is C.
