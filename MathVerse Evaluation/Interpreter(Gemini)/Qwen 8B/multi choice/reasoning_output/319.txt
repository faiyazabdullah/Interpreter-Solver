MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two quadrilaterals, one blue and one green. They're similar, right? The blue one has a diagonal of 8 yards and an area of 36 square yards. The green one has a diagonal of 4 yards, and we need to find its area. 

First, I remember that similar figures have proportional sides and their areas are proportional to the square of the scale factor. Since they're similar, the ratio of their corresponding diagonals should be the same as the ratio of their sides. Wait, but the problem mentions diagonals. Let me think. The blue quadrilateral's diagonal is 8, and the green's is 4. So the ratio of the diagonals would be 8:4, which simplifies to 2:1. That means the scale factor from blue to green is 1/2. 

But how does that relate to the area? If the scale factor is k, then the area scales by k squared. So if the blue area is 36, then the green area should be 36 multiplied by (1/2)^2. Let me calculate that. 36 times 1/4 is 9. So the area of the green quadrilateral should be 9. Let me check if there's anything else I need to consider. 

Wait, are the diagonals corresponding sides? In similar quadrilaterals, corresponding parts are proportional. But do the diagonals correspond? Well, since they're similar, all corresponding linear measures are in proportion. So yes, the diagonals would be in the same ratio as the sides. Therefore, the ratio of areas is (scale factor)^2. 

So, applying that, Area_green = Area_blue * (diagonal_green / diagonal_blue)^2. Plugging in the numbers: 36 * (4/8)^2 = 36 * (1/2)^2 = 36 * 1/4 = 9. That seems straightforward. 

Let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem says they are similar quadrilaterals. Are there any other factors that could affect the area? Like maybe the type of quadrilateral? But since they are similar, regardless of whether they are squares, rectangles, trapezoids, etc., the area ratio depends only on the scale factor. So even if they are different types of quadrilaterals, as long as they are similar, the ratio holds. 

Another way to think about it: suppose the blue quadrilateral has a diagonal of 8, and the green one has half that length. If the shape is similar, then all dimensions are scaled by 1/2. So area scales by (1/2)^2 = 1/4. Thus, 36 divided by 4 is 9. Yep, that checks out. 

Looking at the answer choices, 9 is option A. So the answer should be A.
