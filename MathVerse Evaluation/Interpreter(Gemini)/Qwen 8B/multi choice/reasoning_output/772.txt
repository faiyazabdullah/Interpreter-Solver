Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have three lines: k, l, and m. Line k and line l intersect perpendicularly, which means they form a right angle (90 degrees). Then, line k and line m intersect at an angle of x degrees. Also, it says lines l and m are not parallel. The question is asking which value of x cannot be possible.

First, I need to visualize this. Let me sketch mentally. There's line k and line l crossing each other at a right angle. Now, line m intersects line k at some angle x, and since l and m aren't parallel, they must intersect somewhere too. Since l and m aren't parallel, they must meet at a point, forming another angle. 

Let me recall some concepts. When two lines intersect, the sum of adjacent angles is 180 degrees. Also, if two lines are perpendicular, they form four right angles. Now, considering lines k and l are perpendicular. So, where line m intersects line k, there's an angle x. But also, since line m isn't parallel to l, the angle between m and l must be something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the angles formed around the intersection points. Let me consider the point where lines k and l intersect. Since they're perpendicular, that's a right angle. Now, line m crosses line k at some angle x. Let me imagine that point. Suppose line k is horizontal, line l is vertical (since they are perpendicular). Then line m crosses line k at angle x. Depending on where m is placed, it would make different angles with l.

But since lines l and m are not parallel, they must intersect. So, when line m crosses line l, it forms some angle. Let's denote that angle as y. Now, since l and m intersect, the angles around that intersection would follow certain rules.

Now, looking at the angles around line k and line l. At the intersection of k and m, the angle between them is x. Because lines k and l are perpendicular, the angle between k and l is 90 degrees. So, if line m is intersecting k at x degrees, then perhaps the angle between m and l can be found using supplementary angles?

Wait, let me think again. Let's suppose the lines are arranged such that line k is horizontal, line l is vertical. Then line m crosses k at angle x. Let's say the intersection point is O. So, at point O, line k and line m form angle x. Now, line l passes through O as well, since l and k are perpendicular. So, line l is vertical here. Therefore, the angle between line m and line l would depend on how line m is oriented relative to l.

Since line m is not parallel to l, they must meet at some angle. Let me consider the angles around point O. The angle between k and m is x. Since k and l are perpendicular, the angle between l and k is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle between l and m can be determined based on x. For example, if line m is making angle x with k, then the angle between m and l would be 90 - x degrees? Wait, maybe not. Let me think carefully.

Imagine standing at point O. Line k is horizontal, line l is vertical upwards. Line m crosses k at angle x. If x is measured from k towards m, then depending on direction, the angle between m and l could be either 90 - x or 90 + x, but since angles can't exceed 180 degrees. Wait, actually, when two lines cross, the sum of adjacent angles is 180 degrees. So, if one angle is x, the adjacent angle would be 180 - x. However, since line l is perpendicular to k, the angle between l and k is 90 degrees. So, if line m makes angle x with k, then the angle between m and l would be 90 - x? Or maybe 90 + x?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the concept of consecutive interior angles or something else. Wait, maybe it's better to use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. But maybe focusing on the transversal lines.

Alternatively, think about the angles formed when two lines intersect. Let me try to draw this mentally again. At point O where lines k and m intersect, the angle between k and m is x. Then, since line l is perpendicular to k, passing through O, so line l is vertical. The angle between l and m would be... Well, if line k is horizontal, line l is vertical. The line m crosses k at x degrees. So, if I imagine line m going up from k at angle x, then the angle between m and l would be 90 - x degrees. Because from the vertical line l, turning towards m would be 90 minus the angle between m and k.

Wait, but angles can be on either side. So, if x is acute, then the angle between m and l would be 90 - x. But if x is obtuse, then the angle between m and l would be x - 90 degrees? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think with actual numbers.

Suppose x is 30 degrees. Then, line m makes 30 degrees with k. Since k and l are perpendicular, line l is vertical. So, the angle between m and l would be 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. Alternatively, if x were 120 degrees, then the angle between m and l would be 120 - 90 = 30 degrees. Wait, but angles between lines are always taken as the smallest positive angle between them, so they range from 0 to 180 degrees. So, regardless of whether x is acute or obtuse, the angle between m and l would be |90 - x| if x < 90, or x - 90 if x > 90. But since angles between lines are considered as the smallest angle, the angle between l and m would be min(90 - x, x - 90) if x > 90? No, wait. Actually, the angle between two lines is the smallest angle between them. So, if x is the angle between k and m, then the angle between m and l would be 90 - x if x is less than 90, or x - 90 if x is greater than 90. But since angles between lines are always between 0 and 180, the angle between l and m would be |90 - x|. Wait, but that may not hold if x exceeds 90.

Wait, let me think again. Suppose x is 100 degrees. Then, the angle between k and m is 100 degrees. Since line l is perpendicular to k, then the angle between l and m would be 180 - 100 = 80 degrees? Because when you have two lines intersecting, the adjacent angles are supplementary. Wait, no. Wait, at the intersection point O, the angle between k and m is x. Then, the angle between l and m would be something else. Let me think of the vertical line l. Since l is perpendicular to k, the angle between l and k is 90 degrees. So, if line m makes an angle x with k, then the angle between m and l would be 90 - x if x is measured on one side, or 90 + x if measured on the other. Wait, but angles between lines are always the smallest angle between them. So, if x is more than 90 degrees, then the angle between m and l would be x - 90 degrees? Or 180 - x?

This seems confusing. Maybe I should use the property that the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees. Let me consider the angles around point O. At point O, lines k, l, and m intersect. So, the angles around O would be: the angle between k and m (which is x), the angle between m and l, the angle between l and k (which is 90 degrees), and then the remaining angle. Wait, but since l and k are already intersecting at 90 degrees, and m is crossing through, there are four angles formed. However, since m is another line, it creates two angles at point O.

Wait, perhaps I need to think of the angles created by the intersection of lines k and m, and then how line l interacts with that. Let me try again.

At the intersection of lines k and m (point O), there are two angles: x and its supplement (180 - x). Now, line l passes through point O, being perpendicular to k. So, line l divides the plane into two parts. The angle between l and k is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle between l and m would be dependent on the position of m.

For instance, if line m is on one side of line l, then the angle between l and m would be 90 - x degrees. If line m is on the opposite side, then the angle between l and m would be 90 + x degrees. However, since angles between lines are defined as the smallest angle between them, which ranges from 0 to 180 degrees. So, if 90 + x exceeds 180, then the actual angle would be 180 - (90 + x) = 90 - x. Wait, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, since lines l and m are not parallel, they must intersect. Therefore, the angle between l and m must be non-zero. Also, since l and m are not parallel, the angle between them must be between 0 and 180 degrees, excluding zero.

So, combining all these, let's consider the relationship between x and the angle between l and m. Let me denote the angle between l and m as y. So, y is the angle between l and m, which is non-zero and between 0 and 180 degrees. How does y relate to x?

Since line k and l are perpendicular, and line k and m form angle x. Let me consider the angles around point O. At point O, the angles formed by lines k and m are x and 180 - x. Then, line l passes through O and is perpendicular to k. Therefore, the angle between l and k is 90 degrees. So, if I look at the angle between l and m, it depends on which side of line k the line m lies.

Case 1: Line m is on the same side of line k as line l. In this case, the angle between l and m would be 90 - x degrees. Because starting from line k, moving towards l (which is 90 degrees), and then subtracting the angle x that m makes with k. So, if x is smaller than 90, then y = 90 - x. If x is larger than 90, then y would be negative, but since angles can't be negative, we take absolute value. Wait, but this might not be accurate.

Alternatively, maybe the angle between l and m is |90 - x|, because if x is the angle between k and m, then the difference between the perpendicularity of l and k would give the angle between l and m.

But if that's the case, then y = |90 - x|. However, since y must be between 0 and 180, and since l and m are not parallel, y â  0. Therefore, |90 - x| â  0 â x â  90 degrees. But wait, the problem states that lines l and m are not parallel. If x were 90 degrees, then line m would be perpendicular to k, hence also perpendicular to l, making l and m parallel? Wait, no. Wait, if line m is perpendicular to k, then since l is also perpendicular to k, then l and m would be parallel. Because two lines perpendicular to the same line are parallel. Therefore, if x were 90 degrees, then l and m would be parallel, which contradicts the given condition that lines l and m are not parallel. Therefore, x cannot be 90 degrees. Hence, x â  90 degrees. That suggests that x can't be 90, so answer B is invalid.

Wait, but the options include 90 as option B. So, according to this reasoning, 90 is impossible. Therefore, the answer would be B. But let me check if this holds.

Wait, but maybe my earlier assumption that y = |90 - x| is incorrect. Let me verify with an example. Suppose x is 30 degrees. Then, the angle between l and m would be 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. That makes sense. If x is 60 degrees, then angle between l and m is 30 degrees. If x is 120 degrees, then 90 - 120 would be -30, so taking absolute value gives 30 degrees. So, angle between l and m is 30 degrees. So, yes, the angle between l and m would be |90 - x|. Therefore, since l and m are not parallel, |90 - x| â  0 â x â  90 degrees. Therefore, x cannot be 90 degrees. So, option B is 90, which is excluded. Therefore, the answer is B.

But wait, the question asks "Which of the following cannot be the value of x?" So, if x can't be 90, then B is the answer. But let me check if there are other constraints. For example, what about angles exceeding 180? Wait, but x is the measure of the angle between lines k and m. Angles between two lines are always between 0 and 180 degrees, so x must be between 0 and 180. Therefore, x can be any value except 90, because otherwise l and m would be parallel. Thus, the answer is B, 90. But let me confirm with the answer choices.

The options are A.89, B.90, C.91, D.92, E.93. So, 90 is excluded. Therefore, the answer is B. Hence, the correct answer is B.
