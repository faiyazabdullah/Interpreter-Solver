QUESTION:
A hollow cylindrical pipe has the dimensions shown in the figure. The outer diameter is 2.1 centimeters. The inner diameter is 1.8 centimeters. The length is 13 centimeters.

The pipe is made of a particularly strong metal.

Calculate the weight of the pipe if 1 (cm)^3 of the metal weighs 5.3g , giving your answer correct to one decimal place.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to find the weight of the hollow cylindrical pipe. The given information includes the outer diameter, inner diameter, and length of the pipe. Also, the density of the metal is provided as 5.3 grams per cubic centimeter. 

So, the main idea here is to calculate the volume of the metal used in the pipe and then multiply it by the density to get the weight. Since it's a hollow cylinder, the volume would be the difference between the volume of the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder. 

Let me recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume V is πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height (or length) of the cylinder. For a hollow cylinder, we subtract the inner volume from the outer volume. 

First, I need to find the radii of both the outer and inner cylinders. The diameters are given as 2.1 cm for the outer and 1.8 cm for the inner. So, dividing each by 2 gives the radii. Let me compute those:

Outer radius (R) = 2.1 / 2 = 1.05 cm
Inner radius (r) = 1.8 / 2 = 0.9 cm

The length (height) of the pipe is given as 13 cm. 

Now, calculating the volumes:

Volume_outer = π * R² * h = π * (1.05)² * 13
Volume_inner = π * r² * h = π * (0.9)² * 13

Subtracting the inner volume from the outer gives the volume of the metal:

Volume_metal = π * h * (R² - r²)

Plugging in the numbers:

R² = (1.05)^2 = 1.1025
r² = (0.9)^2 = 0.81
Difference in squares: 1.1025 - 0.81 = 0.2925

Then Volume_metal = π * 13 * 0.2925

Calculating that:

First, multiply 13 * 0.2925. Let me do that step by step. 13 * 0.2925. Well, 10*0.2925=2.925, 3*0.2925=0.8775, so total is 2.925 + 0.8775 = 3.8025. Then multiply by π. Let's take π ≈ 3.1416. 

So Volume_metal ≈ 3.8025 * 3.1416 ≈ Let me calculate that. 

Approximating 3.8 * 3.1416 is about 11.938, but since it's 3.8025, maybe around 11.94? Wait, let me check more accurately. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use exact fractions. But maybe better to just proceed numerically. 

But wait, let me check again. Maybe there's a mistake in calculation. Let me recompute 13*(R² - r²):

Wait, R squared minus r squared is (R - r)(R + r). That might make it easier. Let me try that. 

R = 1.05, r = 0.9. So R - r = 1.05 - 0.9 = 0.15. R + r = 1.05 + 0.9 = 1.95. So the product is 0.15 * 1.95 = ?

Multiplying 0.15 * 1.95. Let's see: 0.15 * 2 = 0.3, minus 0.15 * 0.05 = 0.0075. So 0.3 - 0.0075 = 0.2925. Same as before. So that part is correct. 

So Volume_metal = π * 13 * 0.2925. Which equals π * 3.8025. 

Now, multiplying 3.8025 by π. Let me use π ≈ 3.1416. 

So 3.8025 * 3.1416 ≈ ?

Well, breaking down:

First, 3 * 3.1416 = 9.4248

Then 0.8 * 3.1416 = 2.51328

Then 0.0025 * 3.1416 ≈ 0.007854

Adding them up: 9.4248 + 2.51328 = 11.93808 + 0.007854 ≈ 11.945934 cm³

So approximately 11.9459 cm³. 

But wait, let me verify with another method. Alternatively, using calculator-like steps:

Multiply 3.8025 × π:

Using a calculator, 3.8025 × π ≈ 3.8025 × 3.1415926535 ≈ 

Well, 3.8 × π is roughly 11.938, and adding the extra 0.0025×π ≈ 0.00785, so total ≈ 11.9459 cm³. 

So Volume_metal ≈ 11.9459 cm³. 

Then, the weight is volume multiplied by density (5.3 g/cm³). 

So weight = 11.9459 × 5.3. Let's calculate that. 

Breaking down:

11.9459 × 5 = 59.7295

11.9459 × 0.3 = 3.58377

Adding together: 59.7295 + 3.58377 ≈ 63.31327 grams. 

So approximately 63.3 grams. 

Wait, but the problem says to give the answer correct to one decimal place. So rounding 63.313... to one decimal is 63.3. However, I should check my calculations again for accuracy. 

Wait, perhaps I made an error in computing the volume. Let me double-check each step. 

Starting over:

Outer diameter = 2.1 cm → radius R = 1.05 cm. Inner diameter = 1.8 cm → radius r = 0.9 cm. Length = 13 cm. 

Volume of material = π(R² - r²) * length. 

Compute R² - r²: (1.05)^2 - (0.9)^2. 

As earlier, that's (1.05 - 0.9)(1.05 + 0.9) = 0.15 * 1.95 = 0.2925. Correct. 

Then multiply by length 13: 0.2925 * 13 = 3.8025. Then times π: 3.8025π. 

Yes. So Volume is indeed 3.8025π cm³. 

Then converting to numerical value: 3.8025 × π ≈ 11.9459 cm³. 

Multiply by 5.3 g/cm³: 11.9459 × 5.3. 

Let me compute this multiplication more precisely. 

Let me write 11.9459 × 5.3. 

Breakdown:

First, 11.9459 × 5 = 59.7295

Second, 11.9459 × 0.3 = 3.58377

Summing these two: 59.7295 + 3.58377 = 63.31327 grams. 

Rounded to one decimal place is 63.3 grams. 

But wait, the answer options aren't listed here. Oh, the user mentioned "Answer Choices: No choices found." So they didn't provide options, but the original problem probably had options. However, since the user hasn't provided them, I need to assume that the correct answer is 63.3 grams. 

But let me check once more for errors. Did I miscalculate the volume?

Alternative approach: Compute each volume separately. 

Volume_outer = π*(1.05)^2*13. 

1.05^2 = 1.1025. Multiply by 13: 1.1025 *13. Let me calculate that:

1.1025 * 10 = 11.025

1.1025 * 3 = 3.3075

Total: 11.025 + 3.3075 = 14.3325 cm³. Then multiply by π: 14.3325π. 

Similarly, Volume_inner = π*(0.9)^2*13. 0.81 *13 = 10.53 cm³. Multiply by π: 10.53π. 

Subtracting: 14.3325π - 10.53π = (14.3325 - 10.53)π = 3.8025π. Same as before. 

So Volume_metal is indeed 3.8025π. 

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. 

Thus, the weight is 3.8025π * 5.3 ≈ 11.9459 * 5.3 ≈ 63.3 grams. 

Since the question asks for one decimal place, the answer is 63.3 grams. Therefore, the correct answer is 63.3. 

Assuming the answer choices included this value, but since they weren't provided, I'll present the answer as 63.3. But according to the instructions, I have to choose from A-D, but since the user said "No choices found," perhaps there was an error. However, following the process, the answer is approximately 63.3 grams. 

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume. Let me confirm with exact decimals. 

Alternatively, maybe using more precise value for π. Let's say π = 3.1416. 

So 3.8025 × 3.1416. Let me compute this precisely. 

First, multiply 3.8025 × 3 = 11.4075

Then 3.8025 × 0.1416. Let me compute that:

Breakdown 0.1416 into 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016

Compute 3.8025 × 0.1 = 0.38025

3.8025 × 0.04 = 0.1521

3.8025 × 0.0016 = 0.006084

Add them up: 0.38025 + 0.1521 = 0.53235 + 0.006084 ≈ 0.538434

Total Volume: 11.4075 + 0.538434 ≈ 11.945934 cm³. 

Same as before. 

Then multiply by 5.3: 

11.945934 × 5.3. 

Again, same as before. 

So yes, 63.3 grams. Hence, the answer is 63.3. 

Since the user's instruction says to pick the answer from A-D, but since there are no choices, perhaps in the original problem, the answer was among options like A: 63.3, B: 63.4, etc. But without knowing, I can only conclude the answer is 63.3. Assuming that the correct answer is option A, but since I don't know the actual options, I have to follow the user's instruction to select the correct answer. However, since there are no choices, but the system requires selecting a single letter, perhaps there was an oversight. But given that, I'll proceed with the answer being 63.3, which would correspond to option A if it's the first choice. However, without knowing the options, I can't be sure. But following the problem's structure, the answer is 63.3 grams.
