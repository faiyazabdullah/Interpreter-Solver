<think>
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have a circle with center O, and AB is the diameter. CD is a chord, and lines AB and CD intersect at point E when extended. Also, AB is twice DE, angle E is 16 degrees, and we need to find angle ABC. Let me try to visualize this first.

First, since AB is the diameter of the circle, points A and B are on the circle, and O is the midpoint of AB because it's the center. So OA and OB are radii. Also, CD is a chord, so points C and D lie on the circle. The lines AB and CD intersect at E, which means E is outside the circle since they're extended. 

Given that AB = 2*DE. Wait, AB is the entire diameter, and DE is part of the chord CD? Or maybe DE is a segment from D to E? Let me check the predicates again. Oh, there's a predicate that says Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Mul(2, LengthOf(Line(D,E)))). So AB equals twice DE. So DE is half of AB. Since AB is the diameter, which is 2r, then DE would be r. But also, another predicate says Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,C)), LengthOf(Line(D,E))). So OC is a radius, which is r, and DE is also r. That makes sense. So OC = DE = r.

Now, angle at E is 16 degrees. So angle AEB is 16 degrees. We need to find angle ABC. Let me recall some theorems here. When two chords intersect outside a circle, there's a formula about the angle formed. Specifically, the measure of the angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. 

So angle E is formed by secants EA and EB intersecting at E outside the circle. Therefore, angle E should be equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs would be arc AC and arc BD? Wait, maybe I need to think more carefully. 

Wait, AB is the diameter, so points A and B are endpoints. CD is a chord, so points C and D are somewhere on the circle. When lines AB and CD are extended to meet at E, then the angle at E intercepts arcs AD and BC? Maybe. Let me recall the exact theorem. 

Yes, the formula is: if two secant lines intersect outside the circle, then the measure of the angle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle E = ½ (arc AC - arc BD) or something like that. Wait, but I need to identify which arcs are intercepted. 

Since E is outside the circle, and lines EA and EB are secants. Wait, actually, EA goes through A and B, but since E is outside, the two secants are EC and ED? No, wait. Line AB is extended beyond A and B to meet CD extended at E. Wait, the lines AB and CD intersect at E. So one line is AB, extended beyond A or B, and the other line is CD, extended beyond C or D. So depending on where E is located. 

But since AB is the diameter, and CD is a chord, then extending AB and CD would make E outside the circle. Let me imagine: suppose AB is horizontal, with O in the middle. CD is a chord above or below, and when extended, meets AB at E. Depending on the position of CD, E could be on either side. But given that AB = 2 DE, perhaps E is on the extension of AB beyond A or B. Wait, but AB is the diameter, so if CD is a chord, and lines AB and CD meet at E, then E is outside the circle. Let me consider coordinates to get a better idea.

Alternatively, maybe use power of a point. For point E, the power with respect to circle O would be equal for both secants. Power of point E: EA * EB = EC * ED. Because E lies outside the circle, and EA and EB are parts of the secant line AB, while EC and ED are parts of the secant line CD. 

Given that AB is the diameter, so AB = 2r. Let me denote EA and EB. Suppose E is on the extension of AB beyond B, then EA = EB + AB? Wait, no. Let me define variables. Let’s say the length of AB is 2r. Then DE is r, as per the given condition AB=2DE. So DE=r. 

Also, since OC is a radius, OC = r, same as DE. 

Let me try to apply power of a point. At point E, power w.r.t circle O is EA * EB = EC * ED. 

We know that AB is the diameter, so AB = 2r. Let me assume that E is on the extension of AB beyond B. So EA = EB + AB. Wait, if E is beyond B, then EA = EB + AB? Wait, no. Let me clarify. Let me assign coordinates for clarity. Let me place O at origin (0,0). Let me take AB as horizontal axis. Let’s set coordinates:

Let’s suppose O is at (0,0), A is (-r,0), B is (r,0). Then AB has length 2r. Now, CD is a chord of the circle. Let me parametrize CD such that when extended, it intersects AB at E. Let me call E as some point along AB extended. Let me assume E is beyond B, so that line CD passes through E. 

Then, power of point E gives us EA * EB = EC * ED. 

But we know that AB = 2r, and DE = r. Let me express EA and EB in terms of distances. Let me suppose E is at distance x from B along the extension of AB. So EB = x, and EA = AB + BE = 2r + x. Wait, no. If E is beyond B, then the distance from E to A would be EA = AB + BE. But BE is the distance from B to E, which is x. So EA = AB + BE = 2r + x. 

But according to the power of a point, EA * EB = EC * ED. Here, EC and ED are segments of line CD passing through E. So EC * ED = (EC)(ED). But since CD is a chord, and E is outside, then EC = ED + DC? Wait, no. If E is outside, then EC and ED are the lengths from E to C and E to D. Wait, but if line CD passes through E, then depending on the order of points. Suppose E---C---D, then EC and ED would be such that ED = EC + CD. Alternatively, if E is outside, then maybe EC is longer than ED. Wait, but without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. However, we know that DE = r. So DE is the length from D to E. Assuming that E is outside, and D is one end of the chord. So if E is on the extension of CD beyond D, then DE would be the segment from D to E. In that case, EC would be ED + CD. But CD is a chord of the circle, so its length depends on the position. 

But we also know that DE = r. And OC is a radius, so OC = r. Also, since AB = 2 DE, AB = 2r. Which matches with AB being the diameter. 

But how does this relate to the angle at E? The angle at E is given as 16 degrees. Using the formula for the angle between two secants: angle E = ½ (arc AC - arc BD). Wait, but I need to figure out which arcs these are. 

Alternatively, since AB is the diameter, angle ACB would be a right angle if C is on the circle. Wait, no, angle ACB isn't necessarily a right angle unless C is on the semicircle. But since AB is the diameter, any triangle inscribed with AB as diameter has a right angle at C. So angle ACB is 90 degrees. But we need angle ABC. Hmm, but maybe that's not directly helpful yet. 

Alternatively, considering triangle EAB and triangle ECD. Since EA * EB = EC * ED (from power of point), and we know DE = r, AB = 2r. Let me plug in the numbers. Let me denote:

EA * EB = EC * ED → EA * EB = EC * r.

But I don't know EC or EA or EB. However, maybe we can express them in terms of each other. Let me think. Also, angle at E is 16 degrees. 

Another approach: using the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle EAB or EDC. 

Wait, but angle E is 16 degrees. Let me consider triangle EAB. Wait, but E is outside the circle. So triangle EAB has sides EA, EB, and AB. But we can relate the sides via the Law of Cosines. 

But we also have relations from the power of a point. Let me try to write equations. 

From power of a point: EA * EB = EC * ED. 

But we need to relate EC and ED. Since CD is a chord, and DE is r. Let me assume that E lies on the extension of CD beyond D, so that ED = r, and EC = ED + CD. But CD is a chord of the circle. The length of CD can be found if we know the distance from the center O to the chord CD. Wait, since OC is a radius, and CD is a chord. Let me denote h as the distance from O to CD. Then, the length of CD is 2√(r² - h²). 

But how do I find h? Maybe using triangle OCD. Since OC is a radius, and OD is also a radius. So triangle OCD is isoceles with OC=OD=r. Wait, but CD is a chord. So if I can find the angle COD, then CD = 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle for arc CD. 

But maybe this is getting too abstract. Let me go back to the angle at E. 

Using the external angle formula: angle E = ½ ( arc AC - arc BD ). Wait, why arc AC and BD? Let me think again. The angle formed by two secants outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are those arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. So, in this case, the two secants are EA and EB (which is the same line AB extended), and EC and ED (the line CD extended). Wait, but actually, the two secants are EA and EC, but since EA is along AB and EC is along CD. Wait, maybe I need to think of the two intercepted arcs as the arcs that are cut off by the two secants. 

When two secants intersect outside the circle, the angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are "far" and "near" relative to the point E. So, for example, if the two secants are EA and EC, then the intercepted arcs would be the arc from A to C and the arc from B to D (assuming the diagram is arranged that way). 

But I'm not sure. Let me look up the exact statement. The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. So angle E is ½ ( measure of arc AC - measure of arc BD ). 

Assuming that, then angle E = ½ ( arc AC - arc BD ) = 16 degrees. Therefore, arc AC - arc BD = 32 degrees. 

But how do I relate this to angle ABC? Angle ABC is an inscribed angle. Let me think about that. 

Point C is on the circle. AB is the diameter. So angle ACB is 90 degrees, as mentioned earlier. But angle ABC is part of triangle ABC. Let me see. 

In triangle ABC, angle ABC is at point B. Since AB is the diameter, and C is on the circle, angle ACB is 90 degrees. So triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C. Therefore, angle ABC can be found using trigonometry. 

But how does angle ABC relate to the arcs? 

Alternatively, angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AC. Wait, yes! Inscribed angle subtended by arc AC. The measure of angle ABC is half the measure of arc AC. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle subtended by an arc is half the measure of the arc. 

So if angle ABC = ½ arc AC. 

Earlier, from the external angle formula, we had arc AC - arc BD = 32 degrees. So if I can find arc BD, then I can find arc AC. 

But how? Let me think about other relationships. 

Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. Also, since CD is a chord, the arcs AC and CB depend on where C and D are. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship involving arc BD. Let me consider triangle EBD or something else. 

Wait, but we also know that DE = r. Since DE is a segment from D to E, and DE = r. Also, OC = r. So OC is a radius. Is there a way to connect OC with DE? 

Alternatively, looking back at the power of a point equation. Let me try to compute EA * EB. 

Let me denote EA as follows. Let me assume E lies on the extension of AB beyond B. So EA = EB + AB. Let me denote BE as x. Then, since AB = 2r, then EA = AB + BE = 2r + x. And EB = x. 

Power of point E: EA * EB = EC * ED. 

But ED = r, as given. So EC * r = (2r + x) * x. 

Therefore, EC = [(2r + x) * x] / r. 

But I don't know x or EC. However, maybe I can find another relation involving EC. 

Since CD is a chord of the circle, and E lies on line CD extended. Let me consider triangle ECD. In triangle ECD, we know DE = r, and EC is expressed in terms of x. Also, CD is a chord of the circle. Let me denote CD as y. Then, CD = y, and EC = ED + CD = r + y, assuming E is beyond D. Wait, but earlier I thought EC could be ED + CD if E is beyond D. But if E is beyond D, then EC = ED + CD. So EC = r + y. 

But from power of point, EC = [(2r + x) * x]/r. So [(2r + x)x]/r = r + y. 

But I still don't know x or y. However, perhaps there's another relation. 

Also, note that AB = 2 DE = 2r. So DE = r. 

But I need to find angle ABC. Earlier, angle ABC = ½ arc AC. 

And from the external angle formula, arc AC - arc BD = 32 degrees. 

But how to relate arc BD with other arcs?

Since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. Arc AC plus arc CB equals arc AB, which is 180 degrees. Wait, no. Arc AC and arc CB would add up to arc AB if C is between A and B, but if C is not on AB, then it's different. Wait, since CD is a chord, and AB is the diameter, C and D are points on the circle. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the total circumference. But I'm stuck here. 

Wait, let me consider the fact that angle E is 16 degrees. From the external angle formula, angle E = ½(arc AC - arc BD) = 16°, so arc AC - arc BD = 32°. 

Additionally, since AB is the diameter, arc AB = 180°. Also, the sum of arcs AC, CB, BD, and DA would depend on the positions of C and D. 

But perhaps there's another relationship. Let me think about triangle EBC or something. 

Alternatively, since OC is a radius, and DE = r, maybe there's a way to show that triangle ODE or something is congruent or similar. 

Wait, DE = r, and OC = r. If I can show that triangle ODE is congruent to some other triangle... Not sure yet. 

Alternatively, since DE = OC = r, and if I can find some angles or other sides. 

Alternatively, consider triangle OCE. Since OC is a radius, and OE is a line from O to E. Maybe there's a relationship here. 

But I need more concrete relations. Let me return to the previous equations. 

We had from power of point: EC = [(2r + x) * x]/r. 

Also, EC = ED + CD = r + CD. So:

[(2r + x) * x]/r = r + CD. 

But CD can be expressed in terms of the circle. Since CD is a chord, and if I know the distance from O to CD, I can find CD. Let me denote the perpendicular distance from O to CD as h. Then CD = 2√(r² - h²). 

But how to find h? 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle ODE. Since DE = r, and O is the center. Let me consider coordinates again. 

Let me assume coordinate system with O at (0,0), A(-r,0), B(r,0). Let me assume that line CD intersects AB at E. Let me suppose that E is on the extension of AB beyond B, so E has coordinates (k, 0) where k > r. 

Then, line CD passes through E(k,0). Let me parametrize line CD. Let me denote points C and D on the circle. Since CD is a chord passing through E. 

Parametrically, line CD can be represented as passing through E(k,0) and having some slope m. Points C and D are the intersections of this line with the circle x² + y² = r². 

Let me find the coordinates of C and D. 

Equation of line CD: y = m(x - k). 

Substituting into circle equation:

x² + [m(x - k)]² = r²  
x² + m²(x² - 2kx + k²) = r²  
x²(1 + m²) - 2k m² x + m² k² - r² = 0  

This quadratic equation in x has solutions corresponding to points C and D. The product of roots is [m² k² - r²]/[1 + m²]. 

But since E lies on the line CD, and E is (k,0), which is outside the circle, the product of the distances from E to C and E to D would be equal to the power of point E. 

Wait, the power of point E with respect to the circle is |EO|² - r². EO is the distance from E to O, which is sqrt(k² + 0²) = |k|. So power is k² - r². 

But also, power of point E is equal to EC * ED = k² - r². 

But from the earlier equation, we had EC * ED = (2r + x) * x. Wait, earlier I was using x as BE, which in this coordinate system, BE is the distance from B to E. Since B is at (r,0) and E is at (k,0), then BE = k - r. So x = BE = k - r. 

Thus, EC * ED = (AB + BE) * BE = (2r + (k - r)) * (k - r) = (r + k) * (k - r) = k² - r². Which matches the power of point formula. 

So that checks out. 

Now, from this, we have that EC * ED = k² - r². 

But we also have that DE = r. Wait, the problem states that AB = 2 DE. Since AB = 2r, then DE = r. So DE = r. 

But DE is the length from D to E. Since E is on the line CD, and DE = r, then in the power of point formula, EC * ED = k² - r². But DE = r, so EC = (k² - r²)/r. 

But also, since DE = r, and E is outside the circle, the length DE is the distance from D to E. Let me think about the coordinates. 

Point D is one intersection of line CD with the circle. Let me assume that D is closer to E than C is. So EC = ED + CD. Wait, but if E is outside, then ED would be the distance from E to D, and EC would be the distance from E to C. So if the line passes through E, then EC = ED + CD if D is between E and C. 

But in our case, since CD is a chord, and E is outside, then one of the points C or D is on one side of E, and the other is on the other side. Wait, but since DE = r, and CD is a chord, then maybe D is between E and C, making EC = ED + CD. 

So, EC = ED + CD => EC = r + CD. 

But we also have EC = (k² - r²)/r from power of point. Thus:

r + CD = (k² - r²)/r  
=> CD = (k² - r²)/r - r = (k² - r² - r²)/r = (k² - 2r²)/r. 

But CD is also a chord of the circle. Its length can be calculated if we know its distance from the center. 

Alternatively, using coordinates, we can find CD. Let me recall that in the quadratic equation earlier, the product of the roots for x-coordinates of C and D is [m² k² - r²]/[1 + m²]. But I don't know m. 

Alternatively, since CD is a chord, its length is 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center O to the line CD. 

The distance from O to line CD can be calculated. The line CD has equation y = m(x - k). The distance from O(0,0) to this line is |0 - m(0 - k)| / sqrt(m² + 1) ) = |mk| / sqrt(m² + 1). 

So d = |mk| / sqrt(m² + 1). 

Then CD length is 2√(r² - d²) = 2√[r² - (m²k²)/(m² + 1)]. 

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's another approach. 

Alternatively, since DE = r, and CD = (k² - 2r²)/r, as we found earlier, and CD is also equal to 2√(r² - d²). 

But I'm not sure how to proceed further. 

Maybe instead of coordinates, focus back on the angle relationships. 

We have angle E = 16° = ½(arc AC - arc BD). So arc AC - arc BD = 32°. 

Also, since AB is the diameter, arc AB = 180°. 

Arc AC + arc CB = arc AB if C is on one side. Wait, if points A, C, B are arranged on the circle, then arc AC + arc CB = arc AB. But arc AB is 180°. 

Similarly, arc BD + arc DA = arc BA? No, depending on where D is. 

Alternatively, since CD is a chord, arc CD corresponds to the arc between C and D. 

But how to relate arc BD and arc AC? 

Perhaps considering that angle ABC is an inscribed angle over arc AC. As mentioned before, angle ABC = ½ arc AC. 

If we can find arc AC, then we can find angle ABC. 

From the earlier equation, arc AC - arc BD = 32°. If we can find arc BD, then we can find arc AC. 

Let me think about arc BD. Since D is on the circle, and AB is the diameter. What is arc BD? It depends on where D is. 

But maybe there's another relation. Let me consider triangle EBD or something. 

Wait, since DE = r, and OC = r, and O is the center. If I can find a relationship between DE and OC. 

Alternatively, since OC is a radius, and DE = r, and if we can find an isosceles triangle or something. 

Wait, let me think about triangle ODE. OD is a radius, so OD = r. DE = r. So triangle ODE has OD = DE = r. So it's an isosceles triangle with OD = DE. So angle at D is equal to angle at O. 

But angle at D is angle ODE. Let me calculate angle ODE. 

In triangle ODE, OD = DE = r. So it's an isosceles triangle with base OE and equal sides OD and DE. Wait, no: OD is a radius from O to D, and DE is from D to E. So the two equal sides are OD and DE. So the base is OE. 

Thus, the base angles at O and E are equal. 

So angle at O (angle ODE?) Wait, no. In triangle ODE, vertices are O, D, E. The equal sides are OD and DE. So the base is OE, and the two equal sides are OD and DE. Therefore, the base angles are at O and E. 

Wait, angle at O: angle DOE. Angle at E: angle DEO. These two angles are equal. 

So angle DOE = angle DEO. 

But what is angle DOE? It's the angle between OD and OE. 

Hmm, not sure yet. 

But maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle ODE. 

OD = r, DE = r, OE can be calculated. 

OE is the distance from O to E. In our coordinate system, E is at (k, 0), so OE = |k|. So OE = k. 

So in triangle ODE, sides are OD = r, DE = r, and OE = k. 

Applying the Law of Cosines:

k² = r² + r² - 2*r*r*cos(angle ODE). 

Wait, angle at D is angle ODE. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle ODE, the sides opposite to the angles are:

Opposite angle at O: DE = r

Opposite angle at D: OE = k

Opposite angle at E: OD = r

So applying Law of Cosines for angle at E (which is angle DEO):

cos(angle DEO) = (OD² + OE² - DE²)/(2*OD*OE) = (r² + k² - r²)/(2*r*k) = k²/(2rk) = k/(2r).

But angle DEO = angle DOE (since triangle is isosceles). 

Wait, earlier we said that angle at O and angle at E are equal. So angle DOE = angle DEO. 

So angle at O is angle DOE, and angle at E is angle DEO. 

So angle DOE = angle DEO = arccos(k/(2r)). 

But I don't know k or r. 

However, angle DEO is part of angle E, which is 16 degrees. Wait, angle E is the angle between EA and EC. Wait, no. Angle E is the angle between lines EA and EC? Or between EA and ED? 

Wait, angle E is formed by lines AB and CD intersecting at E. So angle at E is between EA and ED? Or between EA and EC? 

Actually, lines AB and CD intersect at E, so angle E is between EA and ED, since CD is the line passing through E. So angle E is between EA and ED. 

But in our case, angle E is given as 16 degrees. So angle between EA and ED is 16 degrees. 

But angle DEO is part of that angle. Let me think. 

At point E, we have lines EA and ED forming angle E = 16 degrees. Also, in triangle ODE, angle at E is angle DEO, which is part of angle E. 

Wait, but OE is a line from E to O, which is the center. So angle between ED and OE is angle DEO, and angle between EA and OE is something else. 

But unless OE is aligned with some other line, it's hard to see. 

Alternatively, maybe using triangle OAE. Since OA is a radius, and AE is a line from E to A. 

But I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. 

We know that angle E = 16°, and we have arc AC - arc BD = 32°. 

Also, since AB is the diameter, arc AB = 180°. 

Let me consider the full circle, which is 360°. 

Let me denote arc AC as α and arc BD as β. Then α - β = 32°. 

Also, since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180°. 

Now, arc AC + arc CB = arc AB = 180°. So arc CB = 180° - α. 

Similarly, arc BD + arc DA = arc BA? Wait, arc BD and arc DA would depend on where D is. 

Alternatively, considering the entire circle, the sum of all arcs is 360°. 

But without knowing where C and D are placed, it's difficult. 

However, if I assume that points C and D are positioned such that arc AC and arc BD are related. 

But maybe there's another relationship. 

Let me think about triangle ABC. Since AB is the diameter, and C is on the circle, angle ACB is 90°. So triangle ABC is right-angled at C. 

Then, angle ABC is complementary to angle BAC. 

In triangle ABC, angle ABC + angle BAC = 90°. 

But angle BAC is an inscribed angle subtending arc BC. So angle BAC = ½ arc BC. 

And angle ABC = ½ arc AC, as previously stated. 

So, angle ABC = ½ arc AC, and angle BAC = ½ arc BC. 

Since arc AC + arc BC = 180°, then angle ABC + angle BAC = 90°, which matches. 

So, if I can find arc AC, then angle ABC is half of that. 

From earlier, arc AC - arc BD = 32°. 

But I need another equation relating arc AC and arc BD. 

Let me consider arc BD. Since D is on the circle, and CD is a chord. Let me think about arc BD in relation to other arcs. 

If I can express arc BD in terms of arc AC or other arcs. 

But how? 

Alternatively, consider that line CD passes through E, and DE = r. Since DE = r, and OC = r, perhaps there's a symmetry or congruence. 

Wait, OC = r, DE = r. If I can show that triangle ODE is congruent to another triangle, or something. 

But without knowing angles or other sides, it's hard. 

Wait, earlier in triangle ODE, we had OD = DE = r, so it's isosceles. Hence, angle at D is equal to angle at O. 

Wait, angle at D is angle ODE, and angle at O is angle DOE. 

So angle ODE = angle DOE. 

But angle ODE is part of angle E. Let me see. 

At point E, angle between ED and EA is 16 degrees. Also, line OE connects E to O. So angle between ED and OE is angle DEO, which is equal to angle DOE. 

Let me denote angle DEO = angle DOE = x. 

Then, in triangle ODE, the third angle at E is angle OED = x, and the remaining angle at E is 180 - 2x. 

Wait, no. In triangle ODE, the three angles are at O, D, E. 

Sum of angles is 180°. 

So angle at O (DOE) + angle at D (ODE) + angle at E (DEO) = 180°. 

But since OD = DE, angles at O and D are equal. Wait, no: OD and DE are equal, so the angles opposite to them are equal. 

Wait, in triangle ODE, sides OD = DE, so the angles opposite them are equal. 

Side OD is opposite angle at E (angle DEO). 

Side DE is opposite angle at O (angle DOE). 

So angle DEO = angle DOE. 

So let me denote angle DEO = angle DOE = x. 

Then, angle at D is angle ODE = 180° - 2x. 

But angle at D is angle ODE, which is part of the larger angle at E. 

Wait, angle at E (angle DEO) is x, and angle between ED and EA is 16°, which includes angle DEO. 

Wait, maybe I need to consider the full angle at E. 

At point E, there's angle between EA and ED, which is 16 degrees. This angle is composed of angle between EA and EO, and angle between EO and ED. 

But I don't know the exact relationship. 

Alternatively, if I can find x, which is angle DEO, then maybe I can relate it to other angles. 

But I'm not sure. 

Let me try to connect this with the previous equations. 

We have from the external angle: arc AC - arc BD = 32°. 

If I can express arc BD in terms of arc AC, or vice versa. 

Let me consider that arc BD is related to arc AC through some other relation. 

For example, if I can express arc BD as something involving arc AC. 

Alternatively, since AB is the diameter, and CD is a chord, maybe there's a relationship between arc AC and arc BD due to the symmetry. 

But I'm stuck here. 

Let me try to make an assumption to simplify. Suppose that arc AC = 2*arc BD. Then, arc AC - arc BD = arc BD = 32°, so arc AC = 64°, and angle ABC = ½ arc AC = 32°, which is option A. But this is just a guess. 

Alternatively, if arc AC = arc BD + 32°, and if I can find another relation. 

But without more info, it's hard. 

Wait, let me recall that DE = r, and OC = r. Maybe there's a way to show that triangle ODE is congruent to triangle OCA or something. 

Alternatively, since OC = DE = r, and if angle ODE is equal to angle OCA or something. 

Wait, OC is a radius, and DE = r. If I can find some congruent triangles. 

Alternatively, consider triangle ODE and triangle OCA. 

But I don't know enough about the angles. 

Alternatively, since DE = OC = r, and if angle ODE = angle OCA, then maybe triangles are congruent. 

But without knowing angles, it's speculative. 

Let me think back to the external angle formula. 

We have angle E = 16° = ½ (arc AC - arc BD). So arc AC - arc BD = 32°. 

Also, since AB is the diameter, arc AB = 180°. 

Now, if I can find another equation involving arc AC and arc BD. 

Consider that arc AC + arc CB = 180°, as AB is the diameter. 

Also, arc BD is part of the circle. Let me think about arc AD. 

If I can express arc AD in terms of other arcs. 

But I'm not seeing it. 

Wait, let me consider the entire circle. The sum of all arcs is 360°. 

Let me denote:

arc AC = α

arc CB = 180° - α (since arc AC + arc CB = arc AB = 180°)

arc BD = β

arc DA = ?

But I need to relate β with other arcs. 

If I can find arc DA, then maybe I can relate it to β. 

But arc DA + arc AB + arc BC + ...? Not sure. 

Alternatively, since CD is a chord, arc CD = arc CB + arc BD + arc DA? No, it depends on the direction. 

Alternatively, arc CD = arc CB + arc BD if points are arranged in order C, B, D, but that's not certain. 

This is getting too vague. Perhaps I need to make an assumption based on the given options. 

If angle ABC is 32°, then arc AC would be 64°, leading to arc AC - arc BD = 32°, so arc BD = 32°. 

But how does that help? 

Alternatively, if angle ABC is 24°, then arc AC is 48°, so arc BD = 48° - 32° = 16°. 

Or if angle ABC is 16°, arc AC is 32°, arc BD = 0°, which is impossible. 

Or if angle ABC is 48°, arc AC is 96°, arc BD = 96° - 32° = 64°. 

But none of these seem to give a clear path. 

Wait, maybe I should revisit the power of point and the earlier equation. 

We had from power of point: EC * ED = k² - r². 

But DE = r, so EC = (k² - r²)/r. 

Also, from earlier, in triangle ODE, we had:

k² = r² + r² - 2*r*r*cos(angle ODE). 

Wait, no, from the Law of Cosines in triangle ODE:

OE² = OD² + DE² - 2*OD*DE*cos(angle ODE). 

Wait, angle at D is angle ODE, so:

OE² = OD² + DE² - 2*OD*DE*cos(angle ODE). 

But OD = DE = r, so:

k² = r² + r² - 2*r*r*cos(angle ODE)  
=> k² = 2r² - 2r² cos(angle ODE)  
=> k² = 2r²(1 - cos(angle ODE)).

But angle ODE is equal to angle DOE, which we denoted as x. 

So k² = 2r²(1 - cos(x)). 

But also, in triangle ODE, the angles sum to 180°, so:

angle at D (angle ODE) + angle at O (angle DOE) + angle at E (angle DEO) = 180°. 

Since angle at D and angle at O are equal (both x), and angle at E is angle DEO, which is x. Wait, no: earlier we said angle at O and angle at D are equal? Wait, no: in triangle ODE, sides OD and DE are equal, so angles opposite them are equal. Side OD is opposite angle at E (angle DEO), and side DE is opposite angle at O (angle DOE). So angle DEO = angle DOE = x. 

Thus, the three angles are x (at O), x (at E), and angle at D = 180° - 2x. 

Wait, no: angle at D is angle ODE, which is opposite side OE. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me re-express:

In triangle ODE:

- Side OD = r, opposite angle at E (angle DEO).
- Side DE = r, opposite angle at O (angle DOE).
- Side OE = k, opposite angle at D (angle ODE).

Since OD = DE = r, the angles opposite them are equal: angle at E (DEO) = angle at O (DOE). Let's call this angle x. 

So angle DEO = angle DOE = x. 

Then, the remaining angle at D (angle ODE) is 180° - 2x. 

Now, at point E, the angle between ED and EA is 16°. This angle is composed of angle DEO (x) and some other angle? Or is it angle DEO itself? 

Wait, if line OE is drawn, then angle at E between ED and EO is x, and the rest of the angle at E is between EO and EA. 

But without knowing where O is relative to E, it's hard to say. 

But if I assume that line OE is such that angle between EO and EA is some value, say y, then total angle at E is x + y = 16°. 

But I don't know y. 

However, if I can relate x to other angles. 

For example, in triangle OAE, where O is the center, A is on the circle, and E is outside. 

OA is a radius, length r. OE is length k. 

In triangle OAE, we have sides OA = r, OE = k, and AE = 2r + (k - r) = r + k. 

Wait, earlier we defined BE = k - r, and EA = AB + BE = 2r + (k - r) = r + k. 

So in triangle OAE, sides are OA = r, OE = k, and AE = r + k. 

Applying the Law of Cosines here: 

AE² = OA² + OE² - 2*OA*OE*cos(angle AOE). 

So (r + k)^2 = r^2 + k^2 - 2*r*k*cos(angle AOE). 

Expanding left side: r² + 2rk + k² = r² + k² - 2rk*cos(angle AOE). 

Simplify: 2rk = -2rk*cos(angle AOE)  
Divide both sides by 2rk: 1 = -cos(angle AOE)  
So cos(angle AOE) = -1. 

Which implies angle AOE = 180°. 

Wait, that means that points A, O, E are colinear! Because angle AOE is 180°, so O lies on the line AE. 

But AE is the line AB extended, since E is on the extension of AB. So O is on line AE, which makes sense because O is the midpoint of AB. 

Ah! So this confirms that O lies on line AE, which is the line AB extended. So E is on line AB extended, and O is between A and B or B and E? 

Wait, since O is the center of the circle, and AB is the diameter, O is the midpoint of AB. So if E is on the extension of AB, then O is between A and B. If E is beyond B, then O is between A and B, and E is beyond B. 

So in this case, angle AOE is 180°, which makes sense. 

Now, returning to the earlier calculation, this shows that angle AOE is 180°, so points A, O, E are collinear. 

This is crucial! So line AE is the same as line AB extended, and O is on this line. 

Now, let's return to triangle ODE. We had angle at E (DEO) = x, and angle AOE is 180°, so line OE is collinear with AB. 

So, line OE is the same as line AB extended. So point E is on line AB extended, and line CD passes through E. 

So, in this setup, line CD passes through E, and line AB passes through O. 

Now, let me consider the angle at E, which is between lines EA and ED. Since EA is part of line AB, and ED is part of line CD. 

Now, since O is on line AE, and OE is part of line AE, we can consider triangle ODE. 

We had earlier: k² = 2r²(1 - cos(x)), where x is angle DEO. 

Also, in triangle ODE, angle at E is x, and angle at O is x. 

But since O is on line AE, and E is on line AB extended, then line OE is the same as line AE. So the angle at O (angle DOE) is the angle between OD and OE. 

But OD is a radius from O to D, and OE is the line from O to E. 

So angle DOE is the angle between OD and OE. 

But since O is on line AE, and D is a point on the circle, this angle is related to the position of D. 

But how? 

Let me consider triangle ODE. We have OD = r, DE = r, OE = k. 

From earlier, k² = 2r²(1 - cos(x)), where x is angle DEO. 

But also, in triangle ODE, using the Law of Sines: 

sin(x)/OD = sin(angle at D)/DE. 

Wait, OD = DE = r, so this gives sin(x)/r = sin(angle at D)/r → sin(x) = sin(angle at D). 

Angle at D is 180° - 2x, as established earlier. 

So sin(x) = sin(180° - 2x) = sin(2x). 

So sin(x) = sin(2x). 

Solving this equation: 

sin(2x) - sin(x) = 0  
Use identity: sin(2x) = 2 sin(x) cos(x)  
So 2 sin(x) cos(x) - sin(x) = 0  
Factor out sin(x): sin(x)(2 cos(x) - 1) = 0  

Solutions: sin(x) = 0 → x = 0°, 180°, or 2 cos(x) - 1 = 0 → cos(x) = 1/2 → x = 60° or 300°. 

Since x is an angle in a triangle, it must be between 0° and 180°. So possible solutions are x = 60° or x = 0° (but 0° is trivial). 

So x = 60°. 

Thus, angle DEO = x = 60°. 

Now, angle at E (angle DEO) is 60°, but earlier we said that angle at E (between ED and EA) is 16°. How does this fit? 

Wait, angle DEO is part of angle E. Since line OE is collinear with AB, and angle between ED and EA is 16°, and angle DEO is 60°, this suggests that there's a relationship between these angles. 

Let me draw this mentally: at point E, line ED forms an angle with line EA (which is line AB extended). This angle is 16°. But line OE is part of line EA, so angle between ED and OE is angle DEO = 60°, and the remaining part of angle E is between OE and EA. Wait, but if line OE is part of line EA, then angle between ED and OE is part of angle E. 

Wait, line EA is the same as line OE, since O is on line EA. So the angle between ED and EA is the same as the angle between ED and OE, which is x = 60°. But this contradicts the given angle E = 16°. 

Wait, this indicates a contradiction. Where is the mistake? 

Let me review. We derived that in triangle ODE, angle DEO = x = 60°, but this would mean that angle E (between ED and EA) is 60°, but the problem states it is 16°. So there must be a mistake in my reasoning. 

Where did I go wrong? 

Let me retrace. 

From the Law of Sines in triangle ODE: 

sin(x) = sin(2x). 

Solved to x = 60° or 0°. 

But this leads to a contradiction with the given angle E = 16°. 

This suggests an error in assumptions. 

Let me check the Law of Sines step. 

In triangle ODE, sides are OD = r, DE = r, and OE = k. Angles are at O, D, E. 

Angles at O and E are equal (because sides opposite are equal: DE = r and OD = r, so angle at O (opposite DE) = angle at E (opposite OD). Wait, this is where the mistake is! 

Earlier, I thought that angle at E (DEO) and angle at O (DOE) were equal because sides OD and DE are equal. But in reality, side OD is opposite angle at E, and side DE is opposite angle at O. So if OD = DE, then angle at E = angle at O. 

So in triangle ODE, angle at E (DEO) = angle at O (DOE) = x. 

Then, angle at D (ODE) = 180° - 2x. 

But in this case, the angle at E (DEO) is x, which is part of the overall angle at E (between ED and EA). 

But since line OE is collinear with EA, then the angle between ED and EA is the same as angle between ED and OE, which is x. 

But this would imply that x = 16°, but from the equation sin(x) = sin(2x), we get x = 60° or 0°. 

Contradiction. 

So there must be an error in the derivation of the equation sin(x) = sin(2x). 

Let me re-examine the Law of Sines step. 

In triangle ODE, sides:

- Opposite angle at E (DEO): OD = r

- Opposite angle at O (DOE): DE = r

- Opposite angle at D (ODE): OE = k

So, by Law of Sines: 

OD/sin(angle at E) = DE/sin(angle at O) = OE/sin(angle at D)

Since OD = DE = r, and angle at E = angle at O = x, this gives:

r/sin(x) = r/sin(x) = k/sin(180 - 2x) = k/sin(2x). 

So, from r/sin(x) = k/sin(2x), we have:

k = r * sin(2x)/sin(x) = r * 2 cos(x). 

So k = 2r cos(x). 

But we also have from the earlier equation from the Law of Cosines in triangle ODE:

k² = 2r²(1 - cos(x)).

Substitute k = 2r cos(x):

(2r cos(x))² = 2r²(1 - cos(x))  
4r² cos²(x) = 2r²(1 - cos(x))  
Divide both sides by 2r²:  
2 cos²(x) = 1 - cos(x)  
Rearrange: 2 cos²(x) + cos(x) - 1 = 0  

Let me solve this quadratic equation for cos(x). Let y = cos(x):

2y² + y - 1 = 0  
Using quadratic formula: y = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 4 = [-1 ± 3]/4  
So y = (-1 + 3)/4 = 2/4 = 1/2, or y = (-1 - 3)/4 = -1. 

So cos(x) = 1/2 or cos(x) = -1. 

cos(x) = -1 implies x = 180°, which is invalid for a triangle. So valid solution is cos(x) = 1/2 → x = 60° or x = 300°, but since x is between 0° and 180°, x = 60°. 

Thus, x = 60°, so angle DEO = 60°. 

But this contradicts the given angle E = 16°. 

What is the resolution? 

The angle at E (between ED and EA) is supposed to be 16°, but according to this, it's x = 60°. This suggests a contradiction, implying an error in assumptions. 

Wait, but where is the mistake? 

The angle at E in the triangle ODE is x = 60°, but this is the angle between ED and OE, not between ED and EA. 

Because line OE is part of line EA. So the angle between ED and EA is the same as the angle between ED and OE, which is x = 60°. But the problem states that angle E is 16°, so this suggests a contradiction. 

This implies that there is an error in the assumptions made. 

Wait, but the problem states that AB = 2 DE, and DE = r, AB = 2r. So this is consistent. 

But why is there a discrepancy in the angle? 

Maybe the assumption that DE = r is incorrect? Let me recheck. 

The problem states: Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), Mul(2, LengthOf(Line(D,E)))). So AB = 2 DE. Since AB is the diameter, which is 2r, so DE = r. This is correct. 

So DE = r, and from the power of point, we have EC * ED = k² - r², and with DE = r, EC = (k² - r²)/r. 

Also, from the Law of Cosines in triangle ODE, we found k = 2r cos(x), and x = 60°, so k = 2r * cos(60°) = 2r * 0.5 = r. 

So k = r, which means that E is at distance r from O, but since O is the center, and AB is the diameter, this would mean that E is at distance r from O, so it's on the circle? But E is outside the circle, as it's the intersection of AB extended and CD. This suggests a contradiction, because if k = r, then E is on the circle, but the power of a point would be zero, implying EC * ED = 0, which would mean E is on the circle, but DE = r, so this would require EC = 0, which implies E coincides with D, which is not possible. 

This indicates a fundamental error in the reasoning. 

Let me trace back. 

From the Law of Cosines in triangle ODE, we had k = 2r cos(x). 

From the power of point, we had EC = (k² - r²)/r. 

But EC is also equal to r + CD, as we assumed earlier. 

But if k = r, then EC = (r² - r²)/r = 0, which is impossible. 

So this suggests that our assumption about the configuration is wrong. 

Maybe E is not on the extension of AB beyond B, but on the other side. Let me reconsider the position of E. 

Suppose E is on the extension of AB beyond A, so that line CD intersects AB extended at E. In this case, BE = AB + AE, but this might change the sign. 

Let me redefine k as the distance from O to E. If E is on the extension of AB beyond A, then k would be negative, but let's assume k is positive. 

Alternatively, let me consider that E is on the extension of AB beyond A, so that BE = AB + AE, but this might complicate things. 

Alternatively, maybe the error is in the assumption that EC = r + CD. If E is on the extension of AB beyond A, then depending on the position of D, EC could be ED - CD, or something else. 

This suggests that the initial assumption about the position of E (beyond B) might be incorrect. 

Let me try to re-express the power of point with E on the other side. 

Let me assume E is on the extension of AB beyond A, so that EA = x, and EB = AB + EA = 2r + x. 

Wait, no. If E is on the extension of AB beyond A, then the distance from E to A is x, and from E to B is EA + AB = x + 2r. 

Then, power of point E: EA * EB = x*(x + 2r) = EC * ED. 

But DE = r, so EC * r = x(x + 2r) → EC = x(x + 2r)/r. 

If E is on the extension of AB beyond A, then line CD passes through E. Let me assume that D is between E and C, so that ED = r, and EC = ED + CD = r + CD. 

Thus, r + CD = x(x + 2r)/r → CD = x(x + 2r)/r - r = [x(x + 2r) - r²]/r. 

But this still doesn't resolve the issue with the angle. 

Let me return to the angle at E. If E is on the other side, the angle between ED and EA would be different. 

But regardless of the position, the earlier derivation led to x = 60°, which conflicts with the given angle of 16°. 

This suggests that there is a fundamental flaw in the approach. 

Perhaps the initial assumption that angle E is formed by ED and EA is incorrect? Or perhaps the external angle formula was applied incorrectly. 

Let me revisit the external angle formula. The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. 

In this case, the two secants are EA and ED. Wait, no: one secant is EA (part of AB extended), and the other is ED (part of CD extended). But the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are intercepted by the two secants. 

The angle at E is formed by secants EA and ED, so the intercepted arcs are the arcs that are opposite to the angle. 

The formula is: measure of angle E = ½ (measure of arc AC - measure of arc BD), assuming that the secants pass through A and C, and B and D. 

But I need to confirm the exact intercepted arcs. 

The angle at E is formed by secants EA and ED. Secant EA passes through A and B, and secant ED passes through D and C. 

Wait, no. Secant ED passes through E and D, and extends to C. So the intercepted arcs are the arcs between A and C, and between B and D. 

Yes, that's correct. So angle E = ½ (arc AC - arc BD) = 16°, so arc AC - arc BD = 32°. 

This part is correct. 

Now, let me consider that in this scenario, the angle at E is 16°, and from the earlier derivation, we found that x = 60°, which suggests that there is a miscalculation. 

But why? 

Let me try to use the value of x = 60° and see what it implies. 

If x = 60°, then from k = 2r cos(x) = 2r * cos(60°) = 2r * 0.5 = r. 

So k = r, which means that E is at distance r from O. But since O is the center, this places E on the circle. But E is supposed to be outside the circle, as it's the intersection of AB extended and CD. 

This suggests that E is on the circle, which would make DE = r, and since DE is a tangent or secant. 

But if E is on the circle, then DE would be a tangent or secant. 

But if E is on the circle, then the power of point E would be zero, so EC * ED = 0. This would mean either EC or ED is zero, which implies E is at D or C. But this is not possible. 

This contradiction suggests that there is an error in the assumption that the angle at E is x = 60°, but where? 

Let me revisit the equation from the Law of Cosines in triangle ODE. 

We had k² = 2r²(1 - cos(x)), and from the Law of Sines, k = 2r cos(x). 

Substituting k = 2r cos(x) into the first equation:

(2r cos(x))^2 = 2r²(1 - cos(x))  
4r² cos²(x) = 2r²(1 - cos(x))  
Divide both sides by 2r²: 2 cos²(x) = 1 - cos(x)  
2 cos²(x) + cos(x) - 1 = 0  
Solving this gives cos(x) = 1/2 or -1. 

So x = 60° or 180°. 

But if x = 60°, then k = r, as before. 

But this leads to E being on the circle, which is a contradiction. 

This suggests that the only possible solution is x = 60°, but this leads to a contradiction with the given angle E = 16°. 

This implies that there is a mistake in the application of the external angle formula. 

Wait, perhaps the angle at E is not ½ (arc AC - arc BD), but ½ (arc AD - arc BC)? Or some other combination. 

Let me double-check the external angle formula. 

The measure of an angle formed by two secants intersecting outside the circle is ½ (difference of the intercepted arcs). 

The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are "cut off" by the two secants. 

In this case, the two secants are EA (passing through A and B) and ED (passing through D and C). 

The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are not containing the point E. 

So, the angle at E is formed by secants EA and ED, so the intercepted arcs are the arcs AC and BD. 

But if the secants are EA and ED, then the angle is ½ (arc AC - arc BD). 

But if E is outside, and the secants pass through A and B, and D and C, then the intercepted arcs are arc AC and arc BD. 

But if the angle is 16°, then arc AC - arc BD = 32°. 

But how to find arc AC? 

Let me consider that angle ABC is ½ arc AC. 

If I can find arc AC, then I can find angle ABC. 

But how? 

Let me consider that arc AC + arc CB = 180°, as AB is the diameter. 

Let me denote arc AC = α, so arc CB = 180° - α. 

Also, arc BD = β, and from the external angle, α - β = 32°. 

Now, I need another equation to relate α and β. 

Let me consider the position of D. Since CD is a chord, and DE = r, and OC = r. 

Maybe there's a relationship between arc BD and other arcs. 

Let me consider triangle ODE, where OD = DE = r, and O is the center. 

If I can find the measure of angle at D, which is angle ODE, and relate it to arc BD. 

But angle ODE is part of the angle at D, which is related to arc BD. 

Wait, angle ODE is an angle at D, between OD and DE. 

Since OD is a radius, and DE is a segment from D to E. 

But how does this relate to arc BD? 

Maybe not directly. 

Alternatively, since DE = r, and OD = r, triangle ODE is isosceles with OD = DE. 

Thus, angle at D is 180° - 2x, where x is the base angle. 

But angle at D is also related to the position of D on the circle. 

If I can find this angle in terms of arc BD. 

But I'm not sure. 

Let me try to use the fact that in triangle ODE, angle at D is 180° - 2x, and this angle is related to the arc BD. 

But how? 

If I can find the measure of angle ODE, which is 180° - 2x, and this angle is related to arc BD. 

For example, if angle ODE is an inscribed angle or something. 

But angle ODE is not an inscribed angle; it's an angle inside the triangle. 

Alternatively, if I can find the measure of angle ODE in terms of arc BD. 

Let me consider that point D is on the circle, and O is the center. 

The angle at D, angle ODE, is formed by OD (radius) and DE. 

If I can relate this angle to arc BD. 

Let me draw OD and DE. Since OD is a radius, and DE = r, and E is outside the circle. 

Maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle ODE, but we already did that. 

But we know that k = 2r cos(x), and k is the distance from O to E. 

But if E is on the circle, k = r, but this leads to contradictions. 

Alternatively, if E is not on the circle, but outside, then k > r. 

But from the equation k = 2r cos(x), and x is an angle in a triangle, so x is between 0° and 180°. 

If x is 60°, k = r, which is on the circle. 

If x is less than 60°, then cos(x) > 0.5, so k > r. 

If x is greater than 60°, cos(x) < 0.5, so k < r, but since E is outside, k > r, so x must be less than 60°. 

Wait, this suggests that x is less than 60°, but our previous solution gave x = 60°, which is on the boundary. 

This suggests that the only possible solution is x = 60°, but this places E on the circle, which is a contradiction. 

This implies that there is no solution under these conditions, which is impossible since the problem exists. 

This suggests that there is a miscalculation in the earlier steps. 

Let me go back to the external angle formula. 

Maybe the angle at E is ½ (arc AD - arc BC) instead of (arc AC - arc BD)? 

Let me check. 

The angle formed by two secants outside the circle is ½ (larger arc - smaller arc). 

In this case, the two secants are EA and ED, and the intercepted arcs are the ones that are not overlapping. 

If the angle is formed by secants EA (through A and B) and ED (through D and C), then the intercepted arcs are arc AD and arc BC. 

Wait, this might be the case. 

Let me verify. 

The angle at E is formed by two secants: one passing through A and B, and the other passing through D and C. The intercepted arcs are the arcs that are not between the points of intersection. 

So, the angle at E is ½ (arc AD - arc BC). 

If this is the case, then angle E = ½ (arc AD - arc BC) = 16°, so arc AD - arc BC = 32°. 

This changes the earlier equation. 

Let me assume this is the correct formula. 

So, angle E = 16° = ½ (arc AD - arc BC), so arc AD - arc BC = 32°. 

Now, let's try to find angle ABC. 

Angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC. So angle ABC = ½ arc AC. 

But how to relate arc AC to other arcs? 

Let me consider the total circle. 

Arc AB is 180°, as it is the diameter. 

Arc AD + arc DB = arc AB = 180°. 

Arc BC + arc CA = arc AB = 180°. 

Let me denote arc AD = y, arc BC = z. 

From the external angle, y - z = 32°. 

Also, arc AD + arc DB = 180° → arc DB = 180° - y. 

Arc BC = z,
