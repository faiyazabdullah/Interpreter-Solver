MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a right triangle with some given angles and measures. Let me start by breaking down the information provided.

First, the problem mentions a right triangle. That means one of the angles is 90 degrees. The right angle is at point B, since there's a predicate saying RightAngle(Angle(B)) and MeasureOf(Angle(B),90). Wait, actually, the Angle(B) here refers to the angle at point B? Or maybe it's referring to the angle itself? Hmm, but in standard terms, if they mention Angle(B), that could mean the angle at vertex B. But since it's a right angle, that would make Triangle ABC a right triangle with the right angle at B. 

Then there's another angle mentioned called "exterior" with measure 123 degrees. The SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(C)),MeasureOf(Angle(exterior)),180) suggests that the sum of angle C and the exterior angle is 180 degrees. Also, Equals(Angle(4),Angle(C)), so angle 4 is equal to angle C. And the question asks for the measure of angle 4.

Wait, let me parse this again. The problem states that in the right triangle, an acute angle is labeled as ∠4 with an external angle of 123 degrees. Need to find m∠4.

Let me recall that in a triangle, the sum of the interior angles is 180 degrees. Since it's a right triangle, one angle is 90°, and the other two are acute angles adding up to 90°. However, there's also an external angle mentioned here. An external angle at a vertex is formed by one side of the triangle and the extension of the adjacent side. The measure of an external angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. 

But wait, the problem says that the external angle is 123°, and the sum of angle C (which equals angle 4) and the external angle is 180°. Wait, according to the SumOf predicate: SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(C)),MeasureOf(Angle(exterior)),180). So MeasureOf(Angle(C)) + MeasureOf(Angle(exterior)) = 180°. Therefore, MeasureOf(Angle(C)) = 180° - 123° = 57°. But angle C is equal to angle 4, so m∠4 would be 57°, which would correspond to choice C. But wait, let me check if that's accurate.

Hold on, but let's think about where the external angle is. If the external angle is at vertex C, then the external angle would be supplementary to the internal angle at C. So, if the external angle is 123°, then the internal angle at C would be 180° - 123° = 57°, which would be angle C. Then since angle 4 is equal to angle C, that would make m∠4 = 57°, so answer C. But let me confirm if that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the external angle is related to another angle. Let me consider the triangle again. In a right triangle, the right angle is at B. So angles at A and C are acute. Suppose angle at C is being considered. If we extend one of the sides to form an external angle. For example, extending side BC beyond C to form an external angle at C. Then the external angle would be adjacent to angle C, and its measure would be equal to the sum of the other two angles of the triangle. Wait, the external angle theorem states that the measure of an external angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two remote interior angles. 

So if the external angle is 123°, then it should equal the sum of the other two angles of the triangle. But in our case, the triangle has angles: right angle (90°), angle at A, and angle at C. If the external angle is at C, then the external angle would be equal to the sum of angles at A and B. Wait, but B is the right angle. Wait, no—if the external angle is at C, then the two remote interior angles would be angles at A and B. But angle B is 90°, so the external angle would be 90° + angle A. But the problem says that the external angle is 123°, so 90° + angle A = 123°, which implies angle A = 33°. Then angle C would be 90° - angle A = 57°, making angle C = 57°, which would be angle 4. But according to the given SumOf predicate, the sum of angle C and the external angle is 180. Wait, earlier I thought that SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(C)),MeasureOf(Angle(exterior)),180). So that would be angle C + external angle = 180. Which would imply angle C = 180 - external angle = 180 - 123 = 57°, which matches. So regardless of how we approach it, angle C is 57°, which is equal to angle 4. Hence, answer C.

But wait, the problem says that the external angle is 123°, so if that's the external angle at C, then angle C is 57°, which would be angle 4. Alternatively, if the external angle was at another vertex, say A, then the external angle would be equal to the sum of angles B and C. But angle B is 90°, so external angle at A would be 90° + angle C. But that would be different. However, the problem says that the external angle is 123°, so depending on where the external angle is, we get different results.

But according to the given SumOf predicate: MeasureOf(Angle(C)) + MeasureOf(Angle(exterior)) = 180. So regardless of where the external angle is, that equation holds. So angle C plus external angle is 180, leading directly to angle C = 57°, hence angle 4 is 57°, which is answer C.

Therefore, the correct answer should be C.
