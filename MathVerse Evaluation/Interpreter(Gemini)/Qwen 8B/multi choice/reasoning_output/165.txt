MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right triangle ABC where angle C is 90 degrees. The sides AB is 2.0 units long, and BC is 1.0 unit. We need to find the value of sinB.

First, I should recall some basics about right triangles and trigonometric ratios. In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is opposite over hypotenuse. Since angle C is the right angle, the other two angles, A and B, must add up to 90 degrees. 

Given that AB is the hypotenuse because it's opposite the right angle. Wait, wait. Let me make sure. In triangle ABC, if angle C is the right angle, then the hypotenuse would be the side opposite angle C, which is AB. Because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle. So AB is indeed the hypotenuse here. The length of AB is given as 2.0. Then BC is one of the legs, with length 1.0. So BC is adjacent to angle B? Or wait, let me visualize the triangle.

Let me sketch mentally. Point C is the right angle. So points A, B, and C form a triangle with right angle at C. Therefore, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. Given that BC is 1.0. So BC is one leg, and AC is the other leg. AB is hypotenuse of length 2.0.

We need to find sinB. Angle B is at point B. In triangle ABC, angle B is one of the non-right angles. To find sinB, we need the opposite side over hypotenuse. For angle B, the opposite side would be AC, since angle B is at vertex B. The hypotenuse is AB. So sinB = AC / AB.

But we don't know AC yet. However, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AC. Since it's a right triangle, AC² + BC² = AB². Plugging in the known values: AC² + (1.0)² = (2.0)² → AC² + 1 = 4 → AC² = 3 → AC = √3. 

So AC is √3. Therefore, sinB = AC / AB = √3 / 2. Looking at the answer choices, that corresponds to option C. But let me double-check my reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe I mixed up the sides. Let me confirm. In triangle ABC, with right angle at C, so sides: BC and AC are legs, AB is hypotenuse. Angle B is at vertex B. The sides relative to angle B: the opposite side is AC, the adjacent side is BC, and hypotenuse is AB. Yes, so sinB = opposite/hypotenuse = AC / AB = √3 / 2. That's option C. So the answer should be C.
