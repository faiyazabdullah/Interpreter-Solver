MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the equation of a line that has a y-intercept of 3 and an x-intercept of -8. The answer choices are given, so maybe I can use those to check my work, but I should derive it properly.

First, recalling that the intercept form of a line is x/a + y/b = 1, where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept. Wait, here the x-intercept is -8, so a would be -8, and the y-intercept is 3, so b is 3. Plugging those into the intercept form: x/(-8) + y/3 = 1. Let me rearrange that. Multiply both sides by 24 to eliminate denominators: -3x + 8y = 24. Hmm, that simplifies to 3x - 8y = -24? Wait, let me check again. 

Starting from x/(-8) + y/3 = 1. Multiplying each term by 24 gives (-3x) + 8y = 24. Then moving terms around: 3x - 8y = -24. So the equation would be 3x - 8y = -24. Looking at the options, that's option B. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in signs. Let me verify.

Alternatively, using slope-intercept form. The y-intercept is 3, so the equation starts as y = mx + 3. To find the slope m, since the x-intercept is -8, plugging in x = -8, y = 0. So 0 = m*(-8) + 3 → -8m = -3 → m = 3/8. Therefore, the equation is y = (3/8)x + 3. Converting this to standard form Ax + By = C. Subtract (3/8)x: -(3/8)x + y = 3. Multiply all terms by 8 to eliminate fractions: -3x + 8y = 24. Rearranged as 3x - 8y = -24. So same result as before. That's option B.

Wait, looking at the answer choices again:

A. 3x -8y =24  
B. 3x -8y =-24  
C. 3x +8y =24  
D. 3x +8y =-24  

So according to my calculation, it's B. But let me cross-check using another method. Let's take the two points given: (-8,0) and (0,3). The slope between these two points is (3 - 0)/(0 - (-8)) = 3/8. Which matches earlier calculation. Using point-slope form with (0,3): y - 3 = (3/8)(x - 0) → y = (3/8)x + 3. Multiply both sides by 8: 8y = 3x + 24 → 3x -8y = -24. Yep, same equation. So answer is B. Let me check if any other options fit. For example, option A would be 3x -8y =24. If we plug in (0,3): 0 -24 =24 → -24=24? No. So invalid. Option B: 3*(-8) -8*0 = -24 → -24= -24, correct. And for (0,3): 0 -8*3 = -24 → -24=-24, correct. So yes, B is correct. Therefore, the answer should be B.
