MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have an inscribed pentagon ABCDE in a circle O. That means all the vertices lie on the circumference of the circle. The question gives us some angles: angle CAD is 35 degrees, angle AED is 115 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle B. 

First, I remember that in cyclic polygons (those inscribed in a circle), there are certain properties about the angles. For example, opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral sum up to 180 degrees. But wait, here it's a pentagon, so maybe different rules apply? Or perhaps we can break it down into triangles or quadrilaterals?

Let me start by recalling that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, if two points are connected by a chord, the angle formed at another point on the circumference depends on the arcs they intercept. 

Given that ABCDE is inscribed in circle O, all the points A, B, C, D, E lie on the circle. Let me note down the given angles:

Angle CAD is 35 degrees. This angle is formed by points C, A, D. So vertex at A, with sides AC and AD. Similarly, angle AED is 115 degrees, which is at point E, with sides EA and ED. 

Since these are inscribed angles, their measures relate to the arcs they intercept. Let me think about each angle:

For angle CAD (at A): It intercepts arc CD. Wait, because the angle is formed by chords AC and AD. So the intercepted arc would be the arc from C to D that doesn't contain A. Since the pentagon is convex (as it's inscribed in a circle), the arc CD should be the one not passing through other points. Therefore, the measure of angle CAD is half the measure of arc CD. So, arc CD = 2*angle CAD = 2*35 = 70 degrees.

Similarly, angle AED is at point E, formed by chords EA and ED. So this angle intercepts arc AD. Wait, because the angle at E between EA and ED would intercept arc from A to D that doesn't pass through E. Therefore, measure of angle AED is half the measure of arc AD. Hence, arc AD = 2*angle AED = 2*115 = 230 degrees? Wait, that seems too large because the entire circle is 360 degrees. Arcs can't be more than 360, but 230 is possible. However, since the pentagon is inscribed, the arcs between consecutive points would add up to 360 degrees. But let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recall that an inscribed angle intercepts the arc opposite to it. For angle AED, which is at E, the intercepted arc would be arc AD. Because the angle is formed by points A-E-D, so the intercepted arc is from A to D, not containing E. So yes, arc AD is twice angle AED. So arc AD is 230 degrees. Hmm, but that seems like a lot. Let me see if that's possible. 

But if arc AD is 230 degrees, then the rest of the circle would have arcs adding up to 360 - 230 = 130 degrees. But there are other arcs between the points. Maybe I need to consider all arcs. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the intercepted arc for angle AED.

Alternatively, maybe angle AED intercepts arc AB or something else? Wait, no. The angle at E between EA and ED. So the points are E-A and E-D. So the angle is formed by chords EA and ED. The intercepted arc is the arc from A to D that does not pass through E. So yes, arc AD. So that would mean arc AD is 230 degrees. But if arc AD is 230 degrees, then the remaining arcs (arc AB + BC + CD) would be 360 - 230 = 130 degrees. But how do these arcs relate to each other?

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me double-check. The formula is that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle AED is an inscribed angle intercepting arc AD. Therefore, arc AD = 2*angle AED = 230 degrees. But if that's true, then arc AD is indeed 230 degrees. 

Now, moving to angle CAD. Angle at A between CA and DA. So that's an inscribed angle intercepting arc CD. Thus, arc CD = 2*angle CAD = 70 degrees. 

So arc CD is 70 degrees, arc AD is 230 degrees. Now, let's think about the arcs between the points. The total circumference is 360 degrees. Let me denote the arcs between consecutive points as follows:

Arc AB = x
Arc BC = y
Arc CD = z
Arc DE = w
Arc EA = v

But since it's a pentagon, these five arcs add up to 360 degrees. So x + y + z + w + v = 360.

From earlier, arc CD (z) is 70 degrees. Arc AD is 230 degrees. How does arc AD relate to the arcs between the points? Arc AD spans from A to D. Starting at A, going through B and C to D, that would be arc AB + arc BC + arc CD = x + y + z. Alternatively, the other way around, going through E, which would be arc EA + arc DE = v + w. But since arc AD is the larger arc (since angle AED is 115 degrees, leading to arc AD being 230 degrees), which would imply that arc AD is the major arc, so the longer path from A to D. Therefore, arc AD (the major arc) is 230 degrees, which equals v + w. So:

v + w = 230 degrees.

Also, the minor arc AD would be x + y + z = 70 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, arc AD could be considered as either the minor arc or major arc depending on direction. But since angle AED intercepts the arc AD that does not contain E, which would be the minor arc AD? Wait, no. Let me clarify.

When you have an inscribed angle at point E, the intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite the angle. So if the angle is at E between EA and ED, then the intercepted arc is the arc from A to D that does not contain E. In the pentagon, the points are ordered A, B, C, D, E. So the arc from A to D not containing E would go through B and C, which is arc AB + BC + CD = x + y + z. But earlier, we thought that arc AD was 230 degrees, which would make that arc (x+y+z) equal to 230 degrees. But that contradicts with arc CD being 70 degrees. Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong here.

Hold on, there's confusion here. Let me re-examine. 

Angle AED is at point E, with segments EA and ED. So the intercepted arc is the arc from A to D that does not pass through E. Given the order of the pentagon is A, B, C, D, E, then the arc from A to D not passing through E would go through B and C, hence arc AB + arc BC + arc CD. Which is x + y + z. Therefore, that arc's measure is 2*angle AED = 2*115 = 230 degrees. Therefore, x + y + z = 230 degrees. 

Earlier, we found arc CD (z) is 70 degrees. So substituting z=70, we get x + y + 70 = 230 → x + y = 160 degrees.

Additionally, the total circumference is 360 degrees. So x + y + z + w + v = 360. Substituting z=70, x + y = 160, so:

160 + 70 + w + v = 360 → 230 + w + v = 360 → w + v = 130 degrees.

But also, arc AD (the major arc) is 230 degrees, which equals w + v? No, wait, the major arc AD is the one that goes through E, so that would be arc AE + arc ED = v + w. Wait, arc from A to D via E is arc AE (from A to E) plus arc ED (from E to D). So that's v + w. And since that's the major arc, which is 230 degrees. So v + w = 230. But earlier calculation said that w + v = 130? That's conflicting. There's inconsistency here. What did I do wrong?

Ah! Here's the mistake. Earlier, when considering arc AD for angle AED, I assumed that the arc intercepted is the arc AB + BC + CD (which is x + y + z = 230). But that would mean that the arc from A to D through B and C is 230 degrees, making the other arc (through E) equal to 360 - 230 = 130 degrees. So the arc from A to D through E is 130 degrees. But according to the previous statement, arc AD (the one intercepted by angle AED) is supposed to be 230 degrees. Wait, but angle AED is an inscribed angle, so the intercepted arc should be the arc that is opposite the angle. Let me confirm.

An inscribed angle's intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the angle's vertex. So for angle at E, the intercepted arc is the arc that doesn't include E. Therefore, the arc from A to D that doesn't pass through E. Since the pentagon is labeled sequentially A, B, C, D, E, then the arc from A to D without passing through E would be the arc passing through B and C, which is arc AB + BC + CD = x + y + z. Therefore, that arc is 230 degrees. Then, the arc from A to D passing through E is 360 - 230 = 130 degrees. Therefore, arc AE + arc ED = v + w = 130 degrees. 

But earlier, I had thought that arc AD (the major arc) was 230 degrees. Wait, but that's incorrect. The intercepted arc for angle AED is the arc AD that doesn't contain E, which is 230 degrees. So that's the arc AB + BC + CD. So that's 230 degrees. Then, the other arc AD (passing through E) is 130 degrees. 

Therefore, arc AD (major arc) is 230 degrees, which is the intercepted arc for angle AED. So that part is okay. 

So, returning to the equations. We have:

z = arc CD = 70 degrees (from angle CAD).

Then, x + y + z = 230 → x + y = 230 - z = 230 -70 = 160 degrees. 

Total circumference: x + y + z + w + v = 360 → 160 + 70 + w + v = 360 → w + v = 130 degrees. 

So arc AE + arc ED = v + w = 130 degrees. 

Now, what about other angles or arcs we can use? Let's look at angle B. The question asks for the measure of angle B. In a cyclic polygon, the measure of an internal angle can be determined based on the arcs. 

In a cyclic polygon, each internal angle is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two adjacent sides. Wait, let me recall. For a cyclic quadrilateral, the internal angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, no, for a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. But for a pentagon, perhaps each internal angle relates to the arcs. 

Alternatively, for any polygon inscribed in a circle, the measure of an internal angle can be calculated using the formula involving the arcs. Let me think. 

Take angle at point B. The internal angle at B is formed by sides AB and BC. These sides correspond to arcs. The measure of angle B would be half the sum of the arcs intercepted by the extensions of those sides. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall that in a cyclic polygon, the internal angle is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two adjacent sides. Wait, no. For a triangle, the internal angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. For quadrilaterals, each internal angle is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. 

Alternatively, for any polygon, the internal angle at a vertex is equal to half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the two adjacent sides. Wait, not sure. Let me take a simpler case: in a cyclic quadrilateral, the internal angle at a vertex is half the measure of the arc opposite to it. Wait, no. For a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Each angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Wait, for example, in a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, angle A intercepts arc BCD, and angle C intercepts arc BAD. Their sum would be half(arc BCD + arc BAD) = ½*(360) = 180 degrees. 

So generalizing, for any cyclic polygon, the measure of an internal angle at a vertex is half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. But in a pentagon, it's more complicated. Let me think. For angle at point B, which is formed by sides AB and BC. The angle itself is an inscribed angle, but what arc does it intercept? 

Actually, in a cyclic polygon, the internal angle at a vertex can be calculated as half the measure of the arc that is opposite to that angle. Wait, for example, in a cyclic quadrilateral, angle B intercepts arc ADC. So angle B = ½(arc ADC). 

Extending this idea, for a cyclic pentagon, angle at B would intercept the arc that is opposite to it. In a pentagon, the opposite arc would be the arc that doesn't contain B. So for angle B, the intercepted arc would be arc from A to C, passing through D and E. Wait, let me visualize. Points are A, B, C, D, E in order on the circle. The angle at B is formed by AB and BC. The intercepted arc would be the arc from A to C that doesn't contain B. So arc AC, which passes through D and E. 

Thus, the measure of angle B would be half the measure of arc AC. Therefore, angle B = ½(arc AC). 

So if I can find the measure of arc AC, then divide by 2 to get angle B. 

How can I find arc AC? Well, arc AC can be broken down into arc AB + arc BC = x + y. From earlier, we found that x + y = 160 degrees. Therefore, arc AC is 160 degrees. Hence, angle B would be ½(160) = 80 degrees. 

Wait, but that seems straightforward. But let me verify if this logic holds. 

Yes, because angle at B is formed by chords BA and BC. The intercepted arc is arc AC that doesn't contain B. Therefore, the measure of angle B is half the measure of arc AC. Since arc AC is x + y = 160 degrees, then angle B is 80 degrees. 

Looking back at the answer choices, option C is 80°, so the answer would be C. 

But wait, let me check again if there are other considerations. Are there any other arcs or angles that affect this? 

We know arc CD is 70 degrees. Also, arc AD (the major arc) is 230 degrees. Let me check if arc AC can be determined in another way. 

Alternatively, arc AC can be found by subtracting other arcs. Let me see. 

Total circumference is 360. We know arc CD = 70, arc AD (major) = 230. Wait, but arc AD (major) is arc from A to D through E, which is arc AE + ED = v + w = 130 degrees, as earlier. Wait, no, earlier we had arc AD (intercepted by angle AED) is 230 degrees, which is the arc from A to D through B and C, i.e., arc AB + BC + CD = x + y + z = 230. And since z = 70, x + y = 160. 

So arc AC is arc AB + arc BC = x + y = 160 degrees. Therefore, angle B is half of that, 80 degrees. 

This seems consistent. Therefore, the measure of angle B is 80 degrees, which corresponds to answer choice C. 

But just to be thorough, let me check if there are other ways this could be approached. 

Another approach: using the fact that the sum of all internal angles in a pentagon is (5-2)*180 = 540 degrees. But since it's cyclic, we can express each internal angle in terms of arcs. 

However, calculating each angle individually may be complex. Let me see if that helps. 

But if angle B is 80 degrees, then sum of all angles would be 540. Let's see if that's possible. 

But since we don't know other angles, maybe this isn't helpful. However, our previous method gave us angle B directly. 

Alternatively, let's think about other angles given. For instance, angle CAD is 35 degrees, which we used to find arc CD = 70 degrees. 

Are there any other angles or arcs we can calculate? For example, angle at A, but the question doesn't ask for that. 

Alternatively, looking at angle AED = 115 degrees, which led us to arc AD = 230 degrees. 

All in all, the conclusion that angle B is 80 degrees seems solid. Therefore, the answer should be C.
