MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the equation for y₂ based on the given predicates. Let me start by understanding the setup.

First, the problem mentions two lines: y₁ and y₂. It says that y₁ is x³, which passes through (0,0). Then there's y₂, which is described as a vertical or horizontal translation of y₁, and it passes through (-2, 0). Also, the blue line is solid (so maybe y₁?), and the red line is dotted (maybe y₂?).

Wait, the given predicates say Blue(Line(y1)) and Red(Line(y2)). So, Line(y1) is blue and Line(y2) is red. But how does that relate to translations?

The main thing here is figuring out the equation for y₂. Since it's a translation of y₁ = x³, and it passes through (-2, 0). Translations can be either horizontal or vertical. But since the point (-2, 0) is on y₂, maybe we can figure out the type of translation.

Let me recall that translating a function horizontally involves replacing x with x - h or x + h. For example, if you have y = f(x - h), that shifts the graph h units to the right. Similarly, a vertical shift would be y = f(x) + k, shifting up or down.

But the problem states that y₂ is a vertical or horizontal translation. So, perhaps it's either shifted left/right or up/down. However, the point (-2, 0) lies on y₂. Let's think about how the original curve y = x³ behaves. The original curve passes through (0,0). If we translate it horizontally, say shifting it left by 2 units, then every point (x, y) on y₁ becomes (x + 2, y) on y₂. Wait, no—if you shift left by 2, then the new x-coordinate is original x minus 2? Or wait, the standard way: to shift a graph left by h units, replace x with x + h. So, for example, if you want to shift y = f(x) left by 2, it becomes y = f(x + 2). Therefore, the point (a, b) on the original graph moves to (a - 2, b) on the translated graph. Wait, no—wait, suppose you have a function y = f(x). To get a horizontal shift, you replace x with x - h. So, if you want to shift it left by h units, h is positive, so you replace x with x + h. So, for example, if h=2, then the new function is y = f(x + 2). That means that the graph is shifted left by 2 units. So, the point (a, b) on the original graph would correspond to (a - 2, b) on the new graph. Because if x was originally a, then x + 2 = a → x = a - 2. So, the point (a, b) becomes (a - 2, b). 

Alternatively, if the translation is horizontal, then the equation would be y = (x + c)^3. Let me check. Suppose we have y = (x + c)^3. This would shift the graph of y = x³ left by c units if c is positive. So, for instance, if c = 2, then the graph is shifted left by 2. So, the point (0,0) on the original graph would move to (-2, 0) on the translated graph. Wait! That's exactly the case here. The problem states that y₂ passes through (-2, 0). So, if the original y₁ is x³, then shifting it left by 2 units gives y = (x + 2)^3. Let me plug in x = -2: y = (-2 + 2)^3 = 0^3 = 0. So yes, that point (-2, 0) is on the graph. Therefore, that suggests that y₂ is y = (x + 2)^3. 

But wait, the problem says that y₂ is a vertical or horizontal translation. So, could it also be a vertical translation? Let's consider that possibility. A vertical translation would mean adding a constant to the entire function. For example, y = x³ + k. If such a translation passes through (-2, 0), then plugging x=-2, y=0: 0 = (-2)^3 + k → 0 = -8 + k → k=8. So, that would give y = x³ + 8. But then, the point (-2, 0) would lie on this graph. However, the problem says that the red line is a translation, but it doesn't specify whether it's horizontal or vertical. But the given equations in the predicates are Equals(y1, Pow(x,3)) and Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)). Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user mentioned that the answer choices are not present, but the initial part had some code-like syntax. Wait, the problem says "Write an equation for y₂ as shown in the graph." And the given equals are for y1 and y2. 

Wait, the user included in the problem the given predicates: Equals(y1, Pow(x,3)), and Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)). Wait, but that seems like the answer is already given? Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem description. The user wrote:

"Given the following geometric predicates:

PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0),Line(x,y))
Blue(Line(y1))
Red(Line(y2))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-2,0),Line(x,y))
Equals(y1,Pow(x,3))
Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3))"

Wait, hold on. The last two lines are Equals(y1, ...) and Equals(y2, ...). Are these part of the given information? Wait, the problem says that the graph shows y1=x³ passing through (0,0) and y2 passing through (-2,0). The question is to write the equation for y2 as shown in the graph. But according to the given predicates, they already state that Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)). So, that would make y2 = (x+2)^3. Which is exactly the horizontal translation left by 2 units of y1 = x³. Which aligns with our earlier conclusion. So, why is this a problem? Maybe I misread the problem. Let me go back.

Wait, the problem says that the user has to provide an equation for y2. But according to the given predicates, Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)) is one of the given things. So, is this a trick question where the answer is simply y2 = (x+2)^3? But then why is the problem presented as needing to be solved? Unless the user made a mistake in pasting the problem, and the actual answer isn't directly given in the predicates. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the user intended the answer to be inferred from the predicates, but the given Equals(y2,...) is part of the problem's setup? Wait, no. Let me read again.

Looking at the problem structure: the user lists the given predicates, including Equals(y1, Pow(x,3)) and Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)). But that seems like the answer is already given in the problem. However, the question asks to "write an equation for y2 as shown in the graph". So, if the problem includes in its given data that y2 is equal to (x + 2)^3, then the answer is that equation. But that would make the problem trivial, unless there's some misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the user is supposed to derive the equation for y2 based on the given conditions, and the Equals(...) lines are part of the problem's constraints? Or perhaps those are the answer choices, and the user is to choose from them? But the user said "Answer Choices: No choices found." So, maybe the problem is presented in a way that the given Equals(...) are part of the problem's setup, and the answer is to confirm that y2 is (x+2)^3. But since the problem says "Write an equation for y2 as shown in the graph," and the given predicates already define y2 as (x+2)^3, then the answer would be that. However, the user's instruction says that the answer choices are not present, so maybe the answer is to be derived. But perhaps there's confusion here. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is phrased in a way that the user needs to infer the equation for y2 based on the points it passes through and being a translation. Given that y1 is x³, which passes through (0,0), and y2 passes through (-2,0), and is a translation. So, if we assume that it's a horizontal translation, then the equation would be y = (x + 2)^3. If it were a vertical translation, then y = x³ + k, and substituting (-2, 0): 0 = (-2)^3 +k => k=8, so y = x³ + 8. But which one is it?

The problem says that the blue line is solid and red is dotted. In the graph, the blue line is y1=x³, and the red line is y2. Now, considering that y2 is a translation. Depending on the direction, but the point (-2,0) is on y2. If it's a horizontal translation, then the shape of the graph is the same as y1, just shifted. Whereas a vertical translation would change the shape vertically. But since the original function is cubic, both types of translations preserve the shape. But how do we know which one?

However, the given Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)) in the predicates suggests that the answer is indeed y2 = (x + 2)^3, which is a horizontal translation. So, the answer should be that equation. But since the user says that the answer choices are not present, perhaps the problem expects us to recognize that from the given info. Hence, the equation for y2 is y = (x + 2)^3, which corresponds to Add(x,2) cubed. Therefore, the correct answer is y2 = (x + 2)^3. But since the user didn't list answer choices, but the initial problem may have had options, but in this case, the answer is derived from the given predicates. Thus, the answer is y2 = (x + 2)^3, which translates to the equation in the predicate. Therefore, the answer is that equation, and since there are no choices, the user is to provide it. But since the user instructed to select from answer choices labeled A-D, but none are present, perhaps the original problem had choices, but the user omitted them. However, in the absence of choices, the answer is y2 = (x + 2)^3. 

But according to the instructions, the user wants the assistant to provide the answer as one of A-D, but since there are no choices, maybe the answer is implied by the given Equals(y2, ...). But the problem says that the user must select from answer choices, which aren't present. However, the initial problem's structure may have had options, but the user hasn't provided them. But given the problem as stated, the answer is y2 = (x + 2)^3. Therefore, assuming that the answer choices included this option, the correct choice would be whatever corresponds to that equation. Since the user hasn't provided choices, but the system requires selecting A-D, perhaps the answer is A, B, C, or D. But without knowing the options, it's impossible to select. However, given that the problem's given Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)) is part of the problem's setup, perhaps the answer is that expression, hence the answer is B or another letter. But since I don't have access to the actual answer choices, I'm stuck. 

Wait, but the user included in the problem's given predicates that Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)), which is equivalent to y2 = (x + 2)^3. Therefore, the answer is that equation, which would be represented as one of the choices. Assuming that the answer choices include this equation, the correct answer is that choice. However, since the user hasn't provided the answer choices, I cannot know the exact mapping. But given the structure of the problem, the answer is y2 = (x + 2)^3. Therefore, if the answer choices had this as option B, for example, then Final Answer: B. But without knowing the options, I can't be certain. However, in the absence of choices, the correct answer is y2 = (x + 2)^3, which is likely one of the options. Since the user's initial prompt mentions that the answer choices are not found, but the problem requires selection, perhaps the correct answer is B. But this is speculative. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that the answer is y = (x + 2)^3, and the answer choices are labeled accordingly. But since the user hasn't provided them, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is y2 = (x + 2)^3, and thus the corresponding answer choice is B. But since I can't verify, I'll have to proceed with the best guess. Alternatively, maybe the answer is B because the equation is Add(x,2) cubed, which might map to option B. However, without seeing the choices, this is uncertain. 

In summary, based on the given information and the analysis, the equation for y2 is y = (x + 2)^3, so the answer is that expression. Assuming that this is one of the answer choices (say, option B), the final answer would be B. But since the user's answer choices are not available, I'll proceed to select B as the answer.
