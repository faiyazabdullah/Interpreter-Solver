MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle O with radius 5.0. Angle at C is 30 degrees. Point P is also on the circle, and in triangle ABP, PB equals AB. We need to find the length of PA.

First, I'll start by recalling some circle theorems and properties. Since ABC is inscribed in the circle, it's a cyclic triangle. The circle's radius is 5, so OA, OB, OC, OP are all radii, each 5 units long. That means OA=OB=OC=OP=5. 

Given that ABC is inscribed in the circle, maybe I should consider the circumradius formula for a triangle. The formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Δ), where Δ is the area. But since we know angle C is 30°, perhaps using the Law of Sines would be better. For any triangle, a/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R. Wait, here angle C is 30°, so maybe applying the Law of Sines here could relate the sides of triangle ABC to the radius.

Let me denote the sides opposite angles A, B, C as a, b, c respectively. Then according to the Law of Sines, c / sin C = 2R. Here, angle C is 30°, so c = 2R * sin C. Substituting R=5 and angle C=30°, c = 2*5*sin(30°) = 10*(1/2)=5. So side AB (which is opposite angle C) is 5 units? Wait, but AB is one of the sides of triangle ABC. Also, there's another condition: in triangle ABP, PB = AB. So PB equals AB, which we just found is 5. Therefore, PB = 5. But since P lies on the circle, OP is also a radius of 5. So triangle OPB has two sides equal to 5 (OP and OB), making it an isosceles triangle. Hmm, but how does that help?

Wait, maybe I need to look at triangle ABP. Given that PB = AB = 5, and points A, B, P are all on the circle. Let me think about the positions. Since ABC is inscribed, and P is another point on the circle. Maybe there's symmetry here. Also, since angle C is 30°, perhaps constructing other angles or arcs.

Alternatively, considering coordinates. Maybe placing the circle O at the origin for simplicity. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let’s assume O is at (0,0). Let's assign coordinates to points A, B, C, P such that they lie on the circle of radius 5. Let me pick coordinates that make calculations easier. Suppose point C is at (5,0), since it's on the circle. Then angle C is 30°, so maybe points A and B are placed such that angle ACB is 30°. However, constructing coordinates for that might be complicated. Alternatively, use complex numbers or parametric angles.

Another idea: since ABC is inscribed in the circle, the measure of angle C is half the measure of the arc AB that it subtends. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle is half the central angle. Wait, angle at C subtended by AB is 30°, so the arc AB measures 60°. Therefore, the central angle for arc AB is 60°, so the chord AB corresponds to a central angle of 60°, which makes triangle AOB equilateral? Because OA and OB are both radii (5 units) and the angle between them is 60°, so triangle AOB is equilateral. Hence, AB = OA = OB = 5. Which confirms that AB is 5. Therefore, AB is 5. And since in triangle ABP, PB = AB = 5, so PB is also 5. But since P is on the circle, OP is 5. So triangle OPB has sides OP=5, OB=5, and PB=5. Therefore, triangle OPB is equilateral. Thus, angle at O is 60°, so the central angle for arc BP is 60°. Therefore, the arc from B to P is 60°, meaning that the chord BP is 5 units. 

Now, we need to find PA. Let's see. Points A, B, P are all on the circle. Let me consider the positions. Since arc AB is 60°, and arc BP is also 60°, depending on where P is located. Wait, but the position of P relative to AB matters. Let me visualize the circle with points A, B, and C. Arc AB is 60°, so if we move from A to B along the circumference, that's 60°. Now, point P is somewhere on the circle such that arc BP is also 60°, but direction depends on whether it's the minor arc or major arc. Assuming P is positioned such that moving from B to P is another 60°, so total arc from A to P would be arc AB + arc BP = 60° + 60° = 120°, unless P is on the other side. Wait, but since triangle ABP is formed, P can't be overlapping with C. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinates. Let me place point O at the origin. Let me assign coordinates. Let’s suppose point A is at (5,0). Since OA is a radius, and angle AOB is 60°, then point B would be at (5cosθ, 5sinθ) where θ is 60° from A. So if A is at (5,0), then B would be at (5cos60°, 5sin60°) = (2.5, (5√3)/2). Now, point P is such that PB = 5. Since PB is a chord of the circle with length 5. The chord length formula is 2R sin(α/2), where α is the central angle. So chord length PB = 2*5*sin(α/2) = 5 → 10 sin(α/2) = 5 → sin(α/2) = 0.5 → α/2 = 30°, so α = 60°. Therefore, the central angle for arc BP is 60°, same as arc AB. So starting from point B, moving 60° around the circle gives us point P. Depending on direction, clockwise or counterclockwise. Let's say we take the direction that places P such that AP is the desired segment.

Assuming movement from B by 60° in the same direction as AB. Wait, original arc AB was 60°, going counterclockwise from A to B. If we go another 60° from B, then point P would be located 60° further. So from point B at 60°, adding another 60° would put P at 120° from point A. So coordinates of P would be (5cos(120°), 5sin(120°)). Cos(120°) is cos(180°−60°) = -cos60° = -0.5, and sin(120°) is sin(60°) = √3/2. So coordinates of P are (-2.5, (5√3)/2).

Now, we need to compute PA. Coordinates of A are (5,0), coordinates of P are (-2.5, (5√3)/2). Using distance formula:

PA² = (5 - (-2.5))² + (0 - (5√3)/2)²  
= (7.5)² + ( - (5√3)/2 )²  
= 56.25 + (25*3)/4  
= 56.25 + 75/4  
Convert 56.25 to fraction: 56.25 = 225/4  
So total PA² = 225/4 + 75/4 = 300/4 = 75  
Therefore PA = sqrt(75) = 5√3. Wait, but 75 is 25*3, so sqrt(75) is 5√3. So PA is 5√3. Looking at the options, D is 5√3. So answer D.

But wait, let me check if my assumption about the position of P is correct. What if P is on the other side? Like instead of going counterclockwise from B by 60°, going clockwise? Then the central angle would be different. Let me check that case.

Suppose from point B, moving 60° clockwise. Original position of B is at 60° from positive x-axis (since A was at 0°, and arc AB is 60°). Moving 60° clockwise from B would place P at 60° - 60° = 0°, which is point A. But then P would coincide with A, making triangle ABP degenerate. Not possible. So that's invalid. Hence, the correct position is the counterclockwise direction, giving P at 120°, leading to PA being 5√3. So the answer should be D.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me verify using Law of Cosines on triangle OAP. Since OA and OP are both radii (5), and angle AOP is the central angle between A and P. Earlier calculation showed that arc AP is 120°, so central angle AOP is 120°. Then, triangle OAP has sides OA=OP=5, angle between them 120°, so PA² = OA² + OP² - 2*OA*OP*cos(angle AOP)  
PA² = 5² + 5² - 2*5*5*cos(120°)  
= 25 + 25 - 50*(-0.5)  
= 50 + 25 = 75  
Thus PA = sqrt(75) = 5√3. Same result. So answer D.
