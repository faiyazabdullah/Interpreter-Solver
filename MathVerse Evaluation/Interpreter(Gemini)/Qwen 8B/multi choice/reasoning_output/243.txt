MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta given some total trip distance. Let me parse the given information first.

We have three points: Des Moines, Phoenix, and Atlanta, forming a triangle. The distances between each pair of cities are given in terms of x. Specifically:

- Distance from Des Moines to Phoenix is 110x + 53.
- Distance from Phoenix to Atlanta is 150x + 91.
- Distance from Atlanta back to Des Moines is 73.8x.

The total trip distance is the sum of these three distances, which equals 3482 miles. The question asks for the distance from Phoenix to Atlanta, which is the second leg of the trip, so that would be 150x + 91. But we need to find the numerical value of this distance once we solve for x.

So, the plan is to set up an equation using the total distance given and solve for x. Once we have x, plug it into the expression for Phoenix to Atlanta distance.

Let me write down the equation:

Total distance = (110x + 53) + (150x + 91) + (73.8x) = 3482.

Combine like terms. First, combine the coefficients of x:

110x + 150x + 73.8x = (110 + 150 + 73.8)x. Let me compute that sum:

110 + 150 is 260, plus 73.8 gives 333.8. So, 333.8x.

Then the constants: 53 + 91 = 144. So the entire equation becomes:

333.8x + 144 = 3482.

Now, subtract 144 from both sides:

333.8x = 3482 - 144.

Calculate 3482 - 144. Let me do that subtraction:

3482 minus 100 is 3382, then minus 44 more is 3382 - 44 = 3338. Wait, wait. Wait, 3482 - 144: 3482 - 100 is 3382, then subtract 44 more? No, because 144 is 100 + 44. So yes, 3482 - 144 = 3338.

Wait, but let me check again. 3482 - 144:

Breakdown: 3482 - 100 = 3382; then subtract 44 more: 3382 - 44 = 3338. Correct.

So, 333.8x = 3338.

Therefore, x = 3338 / 333.8.

Hmm, let me compute that division. Let me see if I can simplify this fraction.

First, note that 333.8 is the same as 3338 divided by 10. So, dividing 3338 by 333.8 is equivalent to multiplying numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal:

So, x = (3338 * 10) / 3338 = 10. Wait, that seems too straightforward. Wait, let me verify:

Wait, original equation: 333.8x = 3338. So x = 3338 / 333.8.

But 333.8 multiplied by 10 is 3338. Therefore, 333.8 * 10 = 3338. Hence, x = 10.

Oh! That simplifies things a lot. Because 333.8 times 10 is indeed 3338. Therefore, x = 10.

So once we know x is 10, we can substitute back into the expression for Phoenix to Atlanta distance, which is 150x + 91.

Plugging in x=10: 150*10 + 91 = 1500 + 91 = 1591.

Looking at the answer choices, D is 1591. So the answer should be D.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation steps to make sure I didn't make an error.

First, adding the coefficients of x:

110 + 150 + 73.8. Let me add them again. 110+150 is 260. Then 260 + 73.8 is 333.8. Correct.

Constants: 53 + 91 is 144. Correct.

Total equation: 333.8x + 144 = 3482. Subtract 144: 333.8x = 3482 - 144 = 3338. Then x = 3338 / 333.8.

Yes, since 333.8 * 10 = 3338, so x=10. Then Phoenix to Atlanta distance is 150*10 +91 = 1500 +91=1591. Which is answer D.

So the correct answer is D.
