MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, and O. Lines AB, CD, and EO are mentioned. The lines AB and CD intersect at point O. Also, EO is perpendicular to AB, and the foot of the perpendicular is O. So, EO is perpendicular to AB at point O. Additionally, there are some angle measures given: angle BOD is 50 degrees, and it's stated that the measure of angle BOD equals the measure of angle AOC. Also, angle AOD equals angle BOC. There are also right angles at EOA and EOB, meaning that EO is perpendicular to both OA and OB, which makes sense since EO is perpendicular to AB.

Let me visualize this. Since EO is perpendicular to AB at O, points A and B lie on opposite sides of EO. Then, lines CD passes through O, intersecting AB at O. The angles around point O are important here. Given that angle BOD is 50 degrees, which is part of the diagram. Also, angles AOC and BOD are equal. And angles AOD and BOC are equal. 

I think the key here is to use vertical angles and properties of intersecting lines. When two lines intersect, they form vertical angles that are equal. But here, we have more than just AB and CD intersecting; there's also EO, which is perpendicular to AB. 

Since EO is perpendicular to AB, then angles EOA and EOB are right angles (90 degrees). That means OA and OB are segments of AB, with O being the midpoint? Wait, not necessarily the midpoint unless specified. But since EO is perpendicular, maybe O is the foot of the perpendicular from E to AB. 

Now, looking at angles. Angle BOD is 50 degrees. Points B, O, D. So, angle at O between BO and OD. Also, angle AOC is equal to angle BOD. So angle AOC is also 50 degrees. Similarly, angle AOD equals angle BOC. 

Wait, how do these angles relate? Let me sketch mentally. Line CD intersects AB at O. So, points C and D are on line CD passing through O. Then, angles formed at O would be around point O. Let me consider the angles around O. Since EO is perpendicular to AB, which is horizontal if I imagine AB as horizontal. Then EO is vertical. 

But maybe coordinates could help. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Suppose O is the origin (0,0). Since EO is perpendicular to AB, let's assume AB is horizontal. So EO is vertical. Let me set coordinates: Let’s say AB lies along the x-axis, so O is at (0,0). Then EO is the y-axis. Therefore, point E is somewhere along the y-axis. 

Points A and B are on the x-axis. Point C and D are on line CD passing through O. Now, angle BOD is 50 degrees. Let me think about where D is. Since angle BOD is at O, between BO (which is along negative x-axis from O) and OD. So OD is making a 50-degree angle with BO. Since BO is pointing towards B (assuming B is to the right of O), then OD would be going upwards from O at 50 degrees above the negative x-axis? Or depending on direction. 

Alternatively, perhaps considering standard position. Let me think again. Let me define coordinate system with O at origin, AB along x-axis. Let’s suppose point B is to the right of O, so B is (b, 0), and A is (-a, 0) for some positive a, b. Then EO is the y-axis, so E is (0, e) for some e. 

Now, line CD passes through O. Let me denote points C and D on line CD. Let me think about the angles. Angle BOD is 50 degrees. So, from point O, looking at B (along positive x-axis?), wait, earlier I said B is to the right of O, so BO is from O to B, which is along positive x-axis. Wait, but angle BOD is at O, between BO and OD. So BO is from O to B (positive x-axis), and OD is from O to D. So angle between BO (x-axis) and OD is 50 degrees. So OD is making a 50-degree angle upward from BO. 

So, if BO is along positive x-axis, then OD is at 50 degrees above x-axis. Therefore, line OD is going up at 50 degrees from O. So point D is somewhere along that line. Similarly, since line CD passes through O, point C would be on the opposite side of O relative to D. 

Also, angle AOC equals angle BOD. So angle AOC is 50 degrees. Since AO is from O to A, which is along negative x-axis. So angle between AO (negative x-axis) and OC is 50 degrees. So OC is making 50 degrees with negative x-axis. Which would mean that OC is going up at 50 degrees from negative x-axis, so direction is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees from positive x-axis. 

Additionally, angle AOD equals angle BOC. Let me check that. Let me see, angle AOD is at O between AO and OD. AO is negative x-axis, OD is at 50 degrees above positive x-axis. So the angle between negative x-axis and OD is 50 + 90 = 140 degrees? Wait, no. Let me think. From AO (negative x-axis) to OD (which is 50 degrees above positive x-axis). The total angle between them would be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees? Wait, maybe I need to calculate it properly.

Imagine AO is pointing left (negative x-axis), and OD is pointing up at 50 degrees from positive x-axis. So the angle between AO and OD is measured from AO to OD. Starting from AO (pointing left), rotating counterclockwise to OD (upwards). So that would be 180 degrees minus 50 degrees, which is 130 degrees. But angle AOD is supposed to equal angle BOC. What's angle BOC?

Angle BOC is at O between BO (positive x-axis) and OC. Earlier, we had angle AOC is 50 degrees. Since angle AOC is between AO (negative x-axis) and OC. So angle AOC is 50 degrees, which would place OC at 50 degrees above negative x-axis. Therefore, angle BOC is the angle between BO (positive x-axis) and OC. Since OC is 50 degrees above negative x-axis, which is equivalent to 180 - 50 = 130 degrees from positive x-axis. Therefore, angle BOC is the angle between positive x-axis (BO) and OC, which is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, if OC is at 50 degrees above negative x-axis, then from positive x-axis to OC is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. So yes, angle BOC is 130 degrees. However, angle AOD was supposed to equal angle BOC. But angle AOD was calculated as 130 degrees? Wait, earlier thought that angle AOD is 130 degrees? Let me confirm.

Angle AOD is at O between AO (negative x-axis) and OD (which is 50 degrees above positive x-axis). To find that angle, imagine starting from AO (left) and turning towards OD (upward). The angle between them is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. So angle AOD is 130 degrees. And angle BOC is 130 degrees. So that checks out with the given condition that angle AOD equals angle BOC. Okay, that seems consistent.

Now, the question asks for angle COE. So angle at O between CO and OE. Since OE is the line EO, which is the y-axis (since EO is perpendicular to AB, which is x-axis). So OE is vertical line. So point E is on the y-axis. 

So angle COE is the angle between OC and OE. Let me find the direction of OC and OE. 

Earlier, OC is at 50 degrees above negative x-axis. So OC is in second quadrant. OE is along positive y-axis (assuming E is above O). Wait, but the problem says EO is perpendicular to AB, and the foot is O. So E is a point such that EO is perpendicular to AB, so EO is vertical (if AB is horizontal). Depending on the direction of EO, E could be above or below O. But since there's a right angle at EOA and EOB, which are both right angles. So, for example, angle EOA is the angle between EO and OA. Since OA is along negative x-axis, and EO is vertical. So if E is above O, then angle EOA is between EO (upward) and OA (left), forming a right angle. Similarly, angle EOB is between EO (upward) and OB (right), also a right angle. So E is above O on the y-axis.

Therefore, OE is the positive y-axis. Now, OC is at 50 degrees above negative x-axis (from previous analysis). So OC is in the second quadrant. The angle between OC and OE (the positive y-axis) is angle COE. So we need to find that angle.

To compute angle COE, let's consider the direction of OC. OC is 50 degrees above negative x-axis. Let me convert that to standard position. The direction of OC is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees from positive x-axis. So, OC is at 130 degrees. OE is along positive y-axis, which is 90 degrees from positive x-axis. So the angle between OC (130 degrees) and OE (90 degrees) is 130 - 90 = 40 degrees. Wait, but angle COE is the angle between OC and OE, so that would be 40 degrees? But wait, maybe I need to verify.

Alternatively, since OC is at 130 degrees from positive x-axis, and OE is at 90 degrees. The difference is 130 - 90 = 40 degrees. But angle between them depends on the direction of rotation. Since OC is in second quadrant and OE is upward, the angle between them is indeed 40 degrees. But wait, let me double-check with another method.

Another way: The direction of OC is 50 degrees above negative x-axis, which is equivalent to 180 - 50 = 130 degrees from positive x-axis. The direction of OE is 90 degrees from positive x-axis. So the angle between them is |130 - 90| = 40 degrees. So angle COE is 40 degrees. But none of the options is 40. Wait, the answer choices are A:30, B:140, C:50, D:60. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine my steps. Maybe I messed up the calculation of the angle between OC and OE. Alternatively, maybe the angle is supplementary?

Wait, OC is at 130 degrees from positive x-axis. OE is at 90 degrees. The angle between them is the absolute difference if they are both measured from the same axis. However, depending on the orientation, sometimes the smaller angle is considered. For instance, if one vector is at 130 degrees and the other at 90 degrees, the angle between them is 40 degrees. But maybe in reality, due to the configuration, it's different?

Wait, but according to the given conditions, angle BOD is 50 degrees. Let me check if there's another relationship I missed. Also, note that angle AOD equals angle BOC, which were both 130 degrees. 

Alternatively, maybe I should look at triangle COE or something else. Let me consider the lines involved. Since EO is perpendicular to AB, and CD passes through O. So, line CD is passing through O, and we have points C and D on it. 

Another approach: Since EO is perpendicular to AB, and O is the intersection point of AB and CD. Also, angle BOD is 50 degrees. So, in triangle BOD, but not sure. Wait, maybe looking at vertical angles and other properties.

Alternatively, since angle BOD is 50 degrees, and angle AOC is equal to that. Also, angle AOD equals angle BOC. Let me consider the sum of angles around point O. The full circle is 360 degrees. Around point O, the angles are:

- Between OA and OB: 180 degrees (since AB is a straight line).
- Angles created by line CD intersecting AB at O. So, line CD creates angles with AB. Let me denote the angles at O.

When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. So, if line CD crosses AB at O, then angles AOC and BOD are vertical angles? Wait, no. Wait, line CD passes through O, so angles around O are:

- Between OA and OC: angle AOC (given as 50 degrees)
- Between OC and OB: angle COB (which is equal to angle AOD, given as equal to angle BOC? Wait, original statement says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,D)),MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,C))). So angle AOD equals angle BOC. 

Let me think again. At point O, the angles formed by lines AB and CD. So, line AB is crossed by line CD at O. Thus, the vertical angles would be:

- angle AOC and angle BOD are vertical angles, hence equal. Which is given as angle BOD=50, so angle AOC=50. Also, angle AOD and angle BOC are vertical angles, thus equal. Hence, angle AOD = angle BOC. 

So, if angle AOC is 50 degrees, then angle BOD is 50 degrees. Then angle AOD and angle BOC are equal. Also, since AB is a straight line, the sum of angles around O on line AB is 180 degrees. So, angles AOC + angle COB = 180 degrees? Wait, no. Wait, line AB is straight, so angles on one side of AB add up to 180. But line CD crosses AB at O, creating four angles. Let me denote them:

- angle AOC (between OA and OC)
- angle COB (between OC and OB)
- angle BOD (between OB and OD)
- angle DOA (between OD and OA)

These four angles should add up to 360 degrees. But since AB is a straight line, angles on one side of CD would add up to 180 degrees. Wait, maybe it's better to think that angle AOC + angle COB = 180 degrees because OA and OB are opposite directions. Wait, OA and OB are in opposite directions since they're on line AB. So, if you take the angles adjacent to each other around point O, like angle AOC and angle COB, they form a linear pair along AB, so they should add up to 180 degrees. Similarly, angles BOD and DOA also form a linear pair along AB, adding up to 180 degrees. 

Given that angle AOC is 50 degrees, then angle COB = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. Also, angle BOD is 50 degrees, so angle DOA = 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. 

Now, angle AOD is the angle between OA and OD. Since OA is along negative x-axis (as per earlier coordinate assumption), and OD is making angle BOD = 50 degrees with OB. Wait, earlier we determined angle BOD is 50 degrees, which is the angle between BO and OD. Since BO is along positive x-axis (from O to B), and OD is making 50 degrees with BO. So, OD is at 50 degrees above BO (positive x-axis). Therefore, angle between OA (negative x-axis) and OD is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees, which matches angle AOD = 130 degrees. 

Now, returning to angle COE. We need to find angle between OC and OE. Let me recall that OE is perpendicular to AB, so it's the y-axis in our coordinate system. 

Point C is located such that angle AOC is 50 degrees. As before, OC is making a 50-degree angle with OA (negative x-axis), placing it in the second quadrant. Let me think of the direction of OC. If OA is negative x-axis, then OC is 50 degrees above OA, meaning it's 50 degrees from negative x-axis towards the upper half-plane. So, in terms of standard position (from positive x-axis), that's 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. 

OE is along the positive y-axis, which is 90 degrees from positive x-axis. So, the angle between OC (at 130 degrees) and OE (at 90 degrees) is 130 - 90 = 40 degrees. But 40 isn't among the answer choices. This suggests an error in reasoning. 

Wait, but the options are A:30°, B:140°, C:50°, D:60°. Where did I go wrong?

Let me check again. Perhaps the angle COE is not directly the difference between those angles. Because angle between OC and OE might involve considering the other side. For example, if OC is at 130 degrees from positive x-axis, and OE is at 90 degrees, then the angle between them could be the smallest angle between them, which is 40 degrees. But if the problem considers the reflex angle, it would be 320 degrees, but that doesn't make sense here. So why is 40 not an option?

Alternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption about the direction of OC. Let me reconsider the angle AOC. If angle AOC is 50 degrees, then depending on which side OC is on. In the case of intersecting lines, the angle could be on either side. Wait, when two lines intersect, there are two angles at each vertex. So, angle AOC could be the acute or obtuse angle. But given that angle BOD is 50 degrees, which is acute, and angle AOC equals angle BOD, so angle AOC is also acute. So, OC is on the side where angle AOC is acute. 

In that case, if OA is negative x-axis, then OC is making a 50-degree angle with OA towards the upper half-plane. So, direction of OC is 50 degrees from negative x-axis upwards. Which places OC in second quadrant, making angle with positive x-axis as 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. 

Then, OE is the positive y-axis. So, from OC (130 degrees) to OE (90 degrees), the angle between them is 40 degrees. But this is not an option. 

Hmm, maybe I misread the question. The question says angle COE. Is that the angle at O between C, O, E? Yes. So, angle between OC and OE. 

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that line EO is not the positive y-axis but the negative y-axis? Wait, the problem states that EO is perpendicular to AB, and the foot is O. So, if AB is horizontal, EO is vertical. But whether it's above or below O? The right angles at EOA and EOB indicate that E is positioned such that EO forms right angles with OA and OB. 

For example, if E is above O, then angle EOA is between EO (upward) and OA (left), forming a right angle. Similarly, angle EOB is between EO (upward) and OB (right), also right angle. So, E is above O. Therefore, OE is upward, i.e., positive y-axis. 

So, angle between OC (at 130 degrees) and OE (at 90 degrees) is 40 degrees. But that's not an option. So, this suggests a miscalculation. 

Alternative approach: Maybe using triangle properties. Let me consider triangle COE. If I can find some relations. 

But without knowing lengths, it's hard. Alternatively, since EO is perpendicular to AB, and CD intersects AB at O, and we know various angles. 

Wait, maybe considering that angle COE is complementary or supplementary to some other angle. 

Alternatively, since angle AOD is 130 degrees (as previously calculated), and angle AOD is equal to angle BOC. Let me see, angle BOC is 130 degrees. 

But angle BOC is the angle between BO and OC. BO is along positive x-axis, OC is at 130 degrees from positive x-axis. So, angle between BO (positive x-axis) and OC is 130 degrees. 

But angle COE is the angle between OC and OE. OE is the positive y-axis. So, if OC is at 130 degrees from positive x-axis, then the angle between OC and OE (which is at 90 degrees) is 130 - 90 = 40 degrees. Still getting 40 degrees. 

Is there a possibility that the angle is actually 180 - 40 = 140 degrees? If the angle is measured the other way. For example, if the angle between OC and OE is the larger angle instead of the smaller. But typically, angles in geometry problems refer to the smaller angle unless specified otherwise. 

Wait, but maybe there's a misunderstanding in the direction of angle BOD. Let me re-express the diagram. 

If angle BOD is 50 degrees, with points B, O, D. So, at point O, between BO and OD. If BO is along positive x-axis, then OD is making 50 degrees with BO. So, OD is going up at 50 degrees from BO (positive x-axis). So, point D is in the first quadrant. Then, line CD passes through O, with D in first quadrant and C in the opposite direction. So, C is in third quadrant? Wait, no. If line CD passes through O, then C and D are on opposite sides of O. So if D is in first quadrant, then C is in third quadrant. 

But then angle AOD is the angle between OA (negative x-axis) and OD (first quadrant). So, from negative x-axis to OD (which is in first quadrant), that's 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. Which matches the earlier conclusion. 

But then angle COE is between OC and OE. OC is in third quadrant, since C is on the extension of line CD beyond O. If line CD passes through O, and D is in first quadrant, then C is in third quadrant. So, OC is in third quadrant. 

Ah! Here's the mistake. Earlier, I assumed OC is in second quadrant, but if C is on the line CD extended beyond O in the opposite direction of D, then OC is in third quadrant. 

Let me clarify. Line CD passes through O. If D is in first quadrant, then C is in third quadrant. So, OC is in third quadrant. So, the direction of OC is 180 + 50 = 230 degrees from positive x-axis? No, wait. If angle AOC is 50 degrees. OA is negative x-axis, and OC is in third quadrant. So, angle between OA (negative x-axis) and OC is 50 degrees. That would mean OC is 50 degrees below negative x-axis, i.e., in third quadrant. 

So, from negative x-axis, rotating 50 degrees downward (clockwise) gives the direction of OC. So, in standard position, that's 180 + 50 = 230 degrees from positive x-axis. 

Then, OE is along positive y-axis (90 degrees). So, the angle between OC (230 degrees) and OE (90 degrees). The angle between them can be found by taking the difference between 230 and 90, but since it's the smallest angle between them, we need to consider the shorter arc. 

Calculating the difference: 230 - 90 = 140 degrees. But since angles are typically taken as the smallest one, if the angle is greater than 180, we subtract from 360. Wait, 140 degrees is less than 180, so that's the angle between them. So angle COE is 140 degrees. Which is option B. 

Ah! So my earlier mistake was assuming OC was in second quadrant, but it's actually in third quadrant. That explains why I got 40 degrees earlier, which wasn't an option. Correcting that, the angle between OC (third quadrant) and OE (positive y-axis) is 140 degrees. 

How did I get that? Let me recheck. 

If OA is negative x-axis, and angle AOC is 50 degrees, then OC is 50 degrees clockwise from OA. Since OA is negative x-axis, moving 50 degrees clockwise would place OC in third quadrant. So, its direction from positive x-axis is 180 + 50 = 230 degrees. 

OE is at 90 degrees (positive y-axis). The angle between OC (230 degrees) and OE (90 degrees) is calculated as follows: 

The absolute difference between 230 and 90 is 140 degrees. Since this is less than 180, it's the smaller angle between them. Hence, angle COE is 140 degrees. 

Thus, the correct answer is B:140°.
