Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right triangle ABC where AB is the hypotenuse with length 10.0 units. Also, the cosine of angle A is 3/5. We need to find the length of BC.

First, I should recall some trigonometry basics. In a right-angled triangle, the cosine of an angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. Since it's a right triangle, one angle is 90 degrees. The problem mentions that angle at C is a right angle because there's a RightAngle predicate for Angle(A,C,B). Wait, wait—let me check the given predicates again. Oh, right, the RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B)) means that angle at point C is the right angle. So triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Therefore, sides AC and BC are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse.

Wait, but the hypotenuse is AB. So the right angle is at C. That makes sense. Now, angle A is one of the acute angles. The cosine of angle A is given as 3/5. Let me visualize the triangle. At vertex A, angle A is adjacent to side AC and opposite to BC. Wait, in standard terms, for angle A, the adjacent side would be AC, and the hypotenuse is AB. So cos(angle A) equals adjacent over hypotenuse, so AC / AB = 3/5.

Given that AB is 10.0, so AC = (3/5)*AB = (3/5)*10 = 6.0. Wait, but hold on. But if the right angle is at C, then AB is the hypotenuse, yes. Then, angle A is at vertex A, so adjacent side is AC, opposite is BC. So cos(A) = AC / AB = 3/5. Therefore, AC = 3/5 * AB = 3/5 * 10 = 6. So AC is 6 units long. 

Now, since it's a right triangle, we can use Pythagoras' theorem. AB² = AC² + BC². Plugging in the numbers: 10² = 6² + BC² → 100 = 36 + BC² → BC² = 64 → BC = 8. So BC is 8 cm. Looking at the options, D is 8cm. So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the sides. Because sometimes in triangles, labeling can be confusing. Let me confirm. The triangle is ABC, right-angled at C. So vertices A, B, C with right angle at C. So sides: AB is hypotenuse, AC and BC are legs. So angle at A is between AC and AB. So the adjacent side to angle A is AC, and the hypotenuse is AB. Therefore, cos(A) = AC / AB. Which gives AC = 6. Then BC can be found via Pythagoras. So BC = sqrt(AB² - AC²) = sqrt(100 - 36) = sqrt(64) = 8. Yep, that seems correct. So BC is 8. Hence, answer D.
