Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D. Lines AB, BC, CD, and BD. There's an angle measure at point B, specifically angle BCD is 70 degrees. Also, it says that line AB is parallel to line CD. Additionally, BD bisects angle ABC. 

Wait, the problem mentions that BC and BA intersect at point B. That makes sense since they share point B. So, BA and BC form angle ABC at point B. Then BD is the bisector of that angle. Also, CD is parallel to AB. 

Given that angle BCD is 70 degrees, we need to find the measure of angle CDB. Let me visualize this. Points A and B connected by line AB. From B, there's another line BC going to point C. Then CD is drawn such that CD is parallel to AB. Point D is connected back to B via BD, which is the angle bisector of angle ABC. 

Since CD is parallel to AB, maybe we can use some properties of parallel lines and transversals here. Also, because BD is an angle bisector, it splits angle ABC into two equal parts. 

Let me recall the angle bisector theorem. It states that the bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But wait, in this case, BD is the bisector of angle ABC, but does it intersect AC? Hmm, maybe not directly applicable here. Alternatively, since AB is parallel to CD, perhaps corresponding angles or alternate interior angles could come into play.

Let me think about the angles. Since AB || CD, and BD is a transversal cutting them. Wait, BD connects B to D. But since AB is parallel to CD, then maybe angle ABD is equal to angle CDB because they are alternate interior angles? Wait, but BD is connecting B to D. Let me clarify the diagram.

Points: A---B---C, with AB and BC forming angle at B. Then CD is a line starting at C, parallel to AB. So, AB || CD. Then D is somewhere along the line CD, and BD is connecting B to D. Also, BD bisects angle ABC. 

So angle ABC is split into two equal angles by BD. Let me denote angle ABD and angle CBD as equal. Let's call each of these angles x. Therefore, angle ABC is 2x. 

Now, looking at triangle BCD. We know angle BCD is 70 degrees. We need to find angle CDB. Let's consider triangle BCD. In triangle BCD, the sum of angles should be 180 degrees. So angle at C is 70 degrees, angle at D is what we need to find (let's call it y), and angle at B is angle CBD, which is x. Therefore, 70 + x + y = 180 => x + y = 110 degrees.

But how do we find x or y? Let's see. Since AB || CD, and BD is a transversal, then angle ABD and angle CDB should be equal because they are alternate interior angles. Wait, angle ABD is part of angle ABC, which was split into two angles x. So angle ABD is x. Therefore, angle CDB (which is y) should be equal to angle ABD (x). Hence, y = x. 

Substituting back into the equation: x + x = 110 => 2x = 110 => x = 55 degrees. Thus, y = 55 degrees. Wait, but angle CDB is y, so would that make it 55 degrees? However, looking at the answer choices, 55 is option A. But let me check again to ensure there's no mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption here. Let me re-examine. Because BD is the angle bisector of angle ABC, so angle ABD equals angle CBD. Now, since AB || CD, the line BD intersects AB and CD. So, angle between AB and BD (angle ABD) and the angle between CD and BD (angle CDB) are alternate interior angles. Therefore, those angles should be equal. Therefore, angle ABD (which is x) equals angle CDB (y). Therefore, yes, x = y. 

Then in triangle BCD, angles are 70 at C, x at B, and y at D. So 70 + x + y = 180. But since x = y, then 70 + 2x = 180 → 2x = 110 → x=55. Therefore, angle CDB is 55 degrees, which would be answer A. But wait, the answer options include A as 55°, so that seems correct. 

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Another way: since AB || CD, then angle ABC is equal to angle BCD? No, because angle ABC is at point B, while angle BCD is at point C. Maybe not directly. But considering the transversal BD. 

Alternatively, since AB || CD, then the consecutive interior angles would add up to 180 degrees. For example, angle ABC and angle BCD. Wait, angle ABC is at point B, and angle BCD is at point C. Are they consecutive interior angles? If BD is the transversal crossing AB and CD, then angle ABC and angle BCD are on the same side of the transversal BD. Therefore, they should be supplementary. Wait, angle ABC is 2x, angle BCD is 70 degrees. So 2x + 70 = 180 → 2x = 110 → x=55. Therefore, angle CBD is x=55 degrees. Then in triangle BCD, angle CBD is 55 degrees, angle BCD is 70 degrees, so angle CDB is 180 - 55 -70 = 55 degrees. Therefore, angle CDB is 55 degrees, which is answer A. 

Yes, that seems consistent. So the answer should be A. But let me check again. 

Another way: since AB || CD, then angle ABD (which is x) is equal to angle CDB (alternate interior angles). So angle CDB = x. And angle CBD is also x. So in triangle BCD, angles are x, 70, x. Sum to 180: 2x +70=180 → x=55. Hence angle CDB is 55. So answer is A. 

Therefore, the correct answer is A.
