MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out what they mean geometrically. 

So, we have a circle labeled as Circle(1). Points A, B, C, D all lie on this circle. There's another point O, which is the center of Circle(1) because it says IsCentroidOf(O, Circle(1)). Wait, centroid usually refers to the center of mass, but in geometry, the center of a circle is its centroid. So O is the center of the circle. Also, O lies on Circle(1)? Wait, that seems contradictory. Because if O is the center of the circle, how can it also lie on the circle? Unless the radius is zero, which isn't possible. Hmm, maybe there's a mistake here? Or perhaps the problem is referring to something else?

Wait, looking again: Point(O) is mentioned, and PointLiesOnCircle(O, Circle(1)). So O is a point on Circle(1). But O is also the centroid (center) of Circle(1). That would imply that the distance from O to itself (the radius) is zero, which can't be unless the circle has radius zero. That doesn't make sense. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check the predicates again.

Wait, the predicate IsCentroidOf(O, Circle(1))—maybe that's not standard terminology. In some contexts, the centroid could refer to the center of mass, so for a circle, the centroid is indeed the center. So O is the center. But then O being on the circle implies that the radius is zero. Which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. But since the problem gives these predicates, maybe there's a different interpretation. Perhaps the circle is defined such that O is the center, but somehow O is also on the circle. That would require the radius to be zero, which is invalid. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, and the circle in question is different? Wait, the problem mentions "the circle" which has two intersection points with the axes. So maybe Circle(1) is the main circle, and O is its center. But O lying on Circle(1) would mean the radius is zero. This seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle referred to in IsCentroidOf is not Circle(1)? Wait, the predicate is IsCentroidOf(O, Circle(1)), so O is the centroid (center) of Circle(1). Then, O is the center of Circle(1), but also lies on Circle(1). That's impossible unless the radius is zero. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup. However, since the problem includes this, maybe I'm missing something. 

Wait, perhaps the circle in question isn't Circle(1)? Let me re-read the problem statement. The question says: "Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph." So the circle in question is the one that intersects the x-axis and y-axis at two points each. But the problem mentions Circle(1), which has four points A, B, C, D on it, and O is its center. But O is also on the circle, leading to a contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle in question is not Circle(1), but another circle? Wait, there's also a Circle(O). Wait, the predicates mention Circle(O)—but O is a point, so maybe that's a different circle. Let me list all the predicates again:

- Circle(1)
- Points A, B, C, D lie on Circle(1)
- Point O
- Circle(O)
- Point O lies on Circle(1)
- O is the centroid (center) of Circle(1)
- OA = OB = OC = OD (since Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,A)), LengthOf(Line(O,B))) etc.)
- Perpendicular(Line(OX), Line(OY))
- Points OX, OY, A, B, C, D

Wait, perhaps the circle in question (the one intersecting the axes) is Circle(O)? Because O is a point, and there's a Circle(O). But the problem states that the circle has two intersection points with the axes. So maybe Circle(O) is the circle in question. But then O is the center of Circle(1), which has points A, B, C, D on it. But O is also on Circle(1), making it impossible. 

This confusion suggests that there might be an inconsistency in the problem's predicates. However, assuming that the problem is consistent, I need to work with the given information. Let me try to focus on the parts that make sense. 

Since O is the center of Circle(1) and points A, B, C, D are on Circle(1), OA, OB, OC, OD should all be radii of the circle. But the predicate says Point(O) lies on Circle(1), implying that OA is zero, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that there's an error. However, maybe the problem uses non-standard definitions. For example, maybe "centroid" here refers to something else. Or perhaps the circle is degenerate. 

But given that the question asks for the center of the circle which has two intersection points with the axes, maybe the intended circle is Circle(O), and O is the center. But how does that fit with the other predicates? 

Let me think differently. Suppose the circle in question is the one that intersects the axes at two points each. Such a circle would have its center along the line y=x or y=-x if symmetric. Wait, but a circle intersecting both axes at two points each would cross the x-axis at two points and the y-axis at two points. So, for example, a circle centered at (a,b) with radius r. To intersect the x-axis (y=0), substituting y=0 into the equation (x-a)^2 + (0-b)^2 = r^2 → (x-a)^2 = r^2 - b². For real solutions, r² - b² ≥ 0 → |b| ≤ r. Similarly, for the y-axis (x=0): (0-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 = r² → (y-b)^2 = r² - a² → |a| ≤ r. So the center coordinates must satisfy |a| ≤ r and |b| ≤ r. 

Now, the question is to find the center of this circle. Given that the circle has two intersection points with each axis, so it's not tangent to either axis. 

But how does this relate to the given predicates? The problem includes points A, B, C, D on Circle(1), which is said to have O as its center. But O is also on Circle(1), which is impossible. Maybe the problem has a typo, and the circle in question is not Circle(1), but another one? Or perhaps the circle in question is Circle(O), which is a separate entity. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle referred to in the question is Circle(1), and despite O being on the circle, we're supposed to ignore that contradiction. Let's proceed under that assumption. 

Assuming that O is the center of Circle(1), and points A, B, C, D lie on it. Since OA = OB = OC = OD, O is equidistant from all four points, confirming it's the center. But O is also on Circle(1), meaning the radius is zero. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the predicate "IsCentroidOf(O, Circle(1))" means that O is the centroid of some shape related to the circle, not necessarily the center. But centroids are typically for polygons. If the circle has points A, B, C, D, maybe forming a square or rectangle, then the centroid of those points would be the average of their coordinates. But if O is the centroid of those points, then O would be the average of A, B, C, D. However, since A, B, C, D lie on the circle, their centroid would be the center of the circle if they are symmetrically placed. 

For instance, if A, B, C, D are the vertices of a square inscribed in the circle, then the centroid of the square (which is also the center of the circle) would be the same as the center O. But in that case, O would be the center of the circle, and hence not on the circle unless the radius is zero. 

But the problem also mentions that the circle has two intersection points with the axes. So, suppose the circle is positioned such that it crosses the x-axis and y-axis at two points each. For example, a circle centered at (h,k), passing through points where x-axis and y-axis are intersected. 

If the circle intersects the x-axis at two points, say (p,0) and (-p,0), and the y-axis at (0,q) and (0,-q), then the center would be at (0,0) if it's symmetric. Wait, if the circle is centered at the origin, then it would intersect the x-axis at (r,0) and (-r,0), and similarly for y-axis. But then the circle would pass through (r,0), (-r,0), (0,r), (0,-r). These points are on the circle. If O is the origin, then O is the center, and the points A, B, C, D could be those intercepts. However, O (origin) is not on the circle unless r=0, which isn't allowed. 

But according to the problem, O is on the circle. So if O is on the circle, then the radius squared equals the distance from O to itself, which is zero. Hence, radius is zero. This is a contradiction. 

Therefore, the only way this works is if the circle has radius zero, which is a single point. But then it wouldn't intersect the axes at two points. 

This suggests that the given predicates may contain conflicting information, making the problem unsolvable as stated. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made an incorrect assumption. 

Perhaps the term "IsCentroidOf(O, Circle(1))" refers to O being the centroid of the circle's circumference or something else. But I don't recall such a definition. Alternatively, maybe "centroid" here refers to the circumcenter or orthocenter of a triangle formed by points A, B, C, D. 

Suppose points A, B, C, D form a rectangle inscribed in the circle. The centroid of the rectangle would be the intersection of its diagonals, which is the center of the circle. But again, if O is the centroid of the rectangle, then it's the center of the circle, so O cannot be on the circle unless the radius is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle in question is not Circle(1), but another circle. Wait, there's also a Circle(O) mentioned. Could that be the circle that intersects the axes? If so, then O is the center of that circle. But the problem says "the circle" which has two intersection points with the axes, so that would be Circle(O). 

But then, the original Circle(1) has points A, B, C, D on it, with O as its center. But O is also on Circle(1), leading to the contradiction again. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle in question is not Circle(1) or Circle(O), but another one. However, the problem doesn't mention any other circles. 

Given this confusion, perhaps the key is to focus on the part about the circle intersecting the axes. The circle that intersects the x-axis and y-axis at two points each would have its center on the line y=x or y=-x, depending on symmetry. 

Assume the circle is symmetric with respect to both axes. So its center is at (h,h) or (h,-h). Let's assume it's at (h,h). The general equation of the circle is (x-h)^2 + (y-h)^2 = r^2. 

To find where it intersects the x-axis (y=0):

(x-h)^2 + (0-h)^2 = r^2 → (x-h)^2 + h² = r² → (x-h)^2 = r² - h². For two distinct points, r² - h² > 0 → r > |h|. Similarly for the y-axis (x=0):

(h)^2 + (y-h)^2 = r² → same condition. 

Thus, the circle intersects both axes at two points each. Now, the question is to find the center of this circle. But how do we determine h and r? 

However, the problem gives us that the circle has points A, B, C, D on it, and O is the center. But earlier contradictions suggest that O is the center and also lies on the circle. Assuming that's acceptable, even though it leads to r=0, which is not possible, but perhaps the problem assumes that. 

Alternatively, maybe the circle in question is not the one with points A, B, C, D, but another circle. But without more information, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, the problem states: "Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph." So this circle is the one we need to analyze. It must intersect both axes at two points each. Therefore, the circle is not the one with points A, B, C, D, but another one. But the given predicates talk about Circle(1) with points A-D and O as its center. 

Maybe the answer is O, which is the center of Circle(1), and despite the contradiction, we are to take O as the center. Even though O lies on the circle, perhaps the problem ignores that. So, if we consider that the circle intersects the axes, and O is its center, then the center is O. 

But the problem says "Write your answer in the form (_ , _)", suggesting numerical coordinates. But the given predicates don't provide coordinates. They just mention points like O, A, B, C, D. 

Ah! Wait, the predicates mention Perpendicular(Line(OX), Line(OY)). So OX and OY are perpendicular lines. And points OX and OY are mentioned. This suggests that O is the origin, and OX and OY are the x-axis and y-axis. Thus, the circle intersects the x-axis and y-axis at two points each, and O is the origin. 

If O is the origin, then the circle's center is at (0,0), and the circle intersects the x-axis and y-axis. For example, a circle centered at the origin with radius r would intersect the x-axis at (r,0) and (-r,0), and the y-axis at (0,r) and (0,-r). 

But in this case, the circle would have points A, B, C, D as those intercepts. But then O is the origin, which is the center, and the circle passes through (r,0), (-r,0), (0,r), (0,-r). So, the points A, B, C, D are those intercepts. 

In this scenario, O is the center of the circle, and the circle has two intersection points with each axis. So the answer would be the center O, which is the origin (0,0). 

But how do we know the coordinates of O? The problem doesn't give explicit coordinates, but since OX and OY are perpendicular lines (presumably the x and y axes), and O is their intersection point, then O is at the origin. Therefore, the center of the circle is (0,0), so the answer is (0,0).

But wait, the problem mentions that O lies on Circle(1). If the circle is centered at O, then O would be the center, and thus not on the circle unless radius is zero. But in this scenario, the circle has radius r, so O is not on the circle. So this resolves the contradiction. 

Ah! Here's the resolution: The circle in question (the one intersecting the axes) is Circle(1), with center O. The predicate says Point(O) lies on Circle(1), which would mean that O is on the circle, implying radius is zero. But that contradicts. However, if the circle is not Circle(1), but another circle. Wait, the problem says "the circle" which has two intersection points with the axes. If that circle is Circle(1), then O is its center, and O is on the circle, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be a different circle. 

Wait, the problem mentions "Circle(O)" as well. Maybe that's the circle in question. If Circle(O) is the circle that intersects the axes, then O is its center. The other Circle(1) has points A, B, C, D on it, with O as its center, but O is also on Circle(1), which would still be problematic. 

But if the circle in question is Circle(O), then O is its center, and the circle intersects the axes. So the center is O. Therefore, the answer is O, whose coordinates are (0,0) if O is the origin. 

But how do we know the coordinates of O? Since OX and OY are perpendicular lines (probably the axes), and O is their intersection point, then O is the origin. Hence, the center is (0,0). 

Therefore, the answer is (0,0).
