QUESTION:
Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

If the graph is translated 10 units up, what will be the coordinates of the new $y$-intercept?

State the coordinates in the form $(a, b)$.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question says that there are two linear functions graphed. One of them has a negative slope, intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4). Then we're told to consider the graph of y = 4 - x, which I think is the same line since when x is 0, y is 4, and when y is 0, x is 4. So that line connects those two points. Now, if this graph is translated 10 units up, we need to find the new y-intercept coordinates.

Wait, translating a graph upwards affects its equation. For a function y = f(x), translating it up by k units would change it to y = f(x) + k. So if the original line is y = 4 - x, moving it up 10 units would make the new equation y = (4 - x) + 10, which simplifies to y = -x + 14. 

Now, the y-intercept of a line in the form y = mx + b is the point where x is 0. Plugging x = 0 into the new equation gives y = -0 + 14, so the y-intercept is (0, 14). Therefore, the coordinates should be (0,14). But wait, the answer choices aren't listed here, but the user mentioned they are options A-D. However, since the user hasn't provided specific choices, maybe the answer is (0,14), which would correspond to one of the options. Since the original intercept was (0,4), adding 10 units up would take it to (0,14). Let me double-check. The translation moves every point on the line up by 10, so the y-intercept, originally at (0,4), moves to (0,4+10)=(0,14). Yep, that seems right. So the final answer should be (0,14). Assuming the options include this, the correct choice would be whatever corresponds to (0,14).
