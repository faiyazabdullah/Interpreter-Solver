====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. The goal is to find the value of x such that the quadrilateral ABCD is a parallelogram. 

Starting with the geometric predicates. We have a quadrilateral ABCD. The diagonals AC and BD intersect at point E. That's important because in a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Also, there are several angle measures given in terms of variables x and y. Let me list them out:

- Measure of Angle(BAC) is x + 4 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(DBA) is 55 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(BDC) is 60 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(CDA) is 3x - 6 degrees.
- Measure of Angle(DAB) is 5y degrees.

Additionally, there are equations given:

- Equals(Add(x,4), Sub(Mul(3,x),6)) → So x + 4 = 3x - 6.
- Equals(Mul(5,y),55) → 5y = 55, which means y = 11.

Wait, but the problem mentions that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, and opposite angles are equal. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. But here, we have angles given, so maybe we can use those properties.

But first, let's handle the equations. Starting with the equation involving x. Solving x + 4 = 3x - 6. Subtract x from both sides: 4 = 2x - 6. Then add 6: 10 = 2x → x = 5. Wait, but that seems straightforward. However, I should check if this is valid considering the entire structure of the problem.

But hold on, the problem says that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. So maybe there are more constraints here. Because even though solving the equation gives x=5, we need to ensure that the angles fit the properties of a parallelogram. Let me think.

In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary. Let me see which angles we have. Let me try to visualize the quadrilateral ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at E. The angles mentioned are:

Angle(BAC) is x+4. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. So, angle BAC would be part of triangle ABC. Also, angle DBA is 55 degrees. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at triangle ABD? Wait, angle at B, between D and A. Maybe I need to consider the sum of angles around point B?

Wait, let me note down all the angles given:

1. Angle at A between BA and CA: ∠BAC = x + 4.
2. Angle at B between D and A: ∠DBA = 55°.
3. Angle at B between D and C: ∠BDC = 60°. Wait, wait, the third measure is Angle(B,D,C) which is ∠BDC? Or is it ∠BDC? Wait, the measure of Angle(B,D,C) would be ∠BDC? Yes, since points B, D, C. So that's angle at D between B and C? Wait, no. Wait, angle with vertex at D, between points B and C. So it's ∠BDC. So that's angle at D between B and C. Similarly, angle at C between A and D: ∠ADC = 3x -6. And angle at A between D and B: ∠DAB = 5y.

Also, since the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal. So ∠A equals ∠C, and ∠B equals ∠D. Also, consecutive angles are supplementary. Let me check if these angle measures align with that.

Let me try to assign variables to each angle. Let's denote:

∠DAB = 5y (given). Since in a parallelogram, ∠DAB and ∠BCD are opposite angles. So ∠BCD should also be 5y. Wait, but another angle is given as ∠ADC = 3x -6. Which angle is that? ∠ADC is at D, between A and C. So in a parallelogram, ∠ADC is opposite to ∠ABC. Wait, maybe I need to label all angles properly.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that in a parallelogram, the sum of all interior angles is 360°, and opposite angles are equal. So if I can express all angles in terms of x and y, set up equations based on the parallelogram properties, and solve for x.

But we already have equations from the problem. Let me recall:

From the given equations:

Equation 1: x + 4 = 3x -6 → solved earlier as x=5.

Equation 2: 5y =55 → y=11.

So if x=5 and y=11, then let's compute all angles:

First, ∠BAC = x +4 = 5+4=9°.

∠DBA =55°, ∠BDC=60°, ∠ADC=3x -6 = 15-6=9°, and ∠DAB=5y=5*11=55°.

Now, let me check if these angles make sense in a parallelogram.

Wait, in a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary. For example, ∠DAB and ∠ADC are adjacent? Wait, depending on the labeling. Let me imagine the parallelogram ABCD, where AB is adjacent to AD and DC. Wait, perhaps better to draw the diagram mentally.

Assuming ABCD is a parallelogram with vertices in order A, B, C, D. So sides AB, BC, CD, DA. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at E.

So, ∠DAB is the angle at vertex A between D and B. In a parallelogram, ∠DAB is equal to ∠BCD. Also, ∠ABC is equal to ∠ADC. Also, ∠DAB + ∠ABC = 180°, since consecutive angles are supplementary.

Given that ∠DAB = 5y = 55°, so ∠ABC would be 180 - 55 = 125°. But do we have any info about ∠ABC?

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle ABD. Wait, ∠DBA is 55°, which is part of angle at B. In parallelogram, angle at B (∠ABC) would be composed of parts? Let me think.

Wait, ∠DBA is 55°, which is part of angle at B. If we can find other angles at B, maybe we can verify consistency.

But perhaps there's another way. Let me check the angles again.

We have ∠ADC = 9°, which in the parallelogram would be equal to ∠ABC. Wait, but ∠ABC would be 125° if ∠DAB is 55°, but ∠ADC is 9°, which contradicts unless my assumption is wrong. Therefore, something is wrong here.

This suggests that x=5 may not satisfy the conditions of the parallelogram. Hence, there's an inconsistency. Therefore, my initial thought that solving x+4=3x-6 directly gives x=5 may be missing some constraints due to the parallelogram properties. Thus, I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, but the problem states that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. So the given angle measures must satisfy the properties of a parallelogram. Therefore, even though the equation x+4=3x-6 gives x=5, this value must also satisfy the angle conditions of the parallelogram. So perhaps there's another equation that needs to be considered.

Let me start over. Given that ABCD is a parallelogram, so opposite sides are parallel. Therefore, AB || CD and AD || BC. This implies that certain angles are equal or supplementary.

Looking at the angles given:

- ∠BAC = x + 4. This is an angle inside the triangle ABC. Since AB || CD, then ∠BAC could be related to other angles via alternate interior angles. But perhaps not directly helpful yet.

- ∠DBA =55°, which is the angle at B between D and A. In the parallelogram, since AB || CD, and BD is a diagonal, this angle could be related to other angles.

- ∠BDC =60°, which is the angle at D between B and C. Since in a parallelogram, AD || BC, so ∠BDC could be related to ∠BAD?

Alternatively, maybe using triangle properties. For instance, in triangle ABD, we know ∠DBA=55°, and in triangle BDC, ∠BDC=60°. Also, the diagonals intersect at E, so maybe triangle AED or others?

Alternatively, since diagonals bisect each other in a parallelogram, so AE = EC and BE = ED. But not sure yet.

Another idea: In a parallelogram, the sum of the squares of the diagonals equals twice the sum of the squares of the sides. But without side lengths, this might not help.

Alternatively, focusing on the angles. Let me try to express all angles in terms of x and y, then use the parallelogram properties.

Given that:

- ∠DAB =5y =55° ⇒ y=11.

Therefore, ∠DAB=55°, which is one angle. In a parallelogram, the opposite angle ∠BCD is also 55°, and the other two angles, ∠ABC and ∠ADC, must each be 180° - 55° = 125°, since consecutive angles are supplementary.

But according to the given, ∠ADC is 3x -6. So 3x -6 =125°. Solving for x: 3x=131 ⇒ x=131/3 ≈43.67. But this conflicts with the previous equation x+4=3x-6 giving x=5. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my assumption that the given angles correspond directly to the parallelogram's angles might be incorrect.

Wait, but why does ∠ADC equal 3x -6? Let me check the original problem statement.

The MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,D),Sub(Mul(3,x),6)). So that's angle at C between A and D. So ∠ACD. Wait, that's different from ∠ADC. Oh! I made a mistake here. ∠ADC is the angle at D between A and C. Whereas ∠ACD is the angle at C between A and D. These are different angles. So I need to clarify.

Let me re-express all given angles:

1. MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C), Add(x,4)): This is ∠BAC, the angle at A between B and C.

2. MeasureOf(Angle(D,B,A),55): This is ∠DBA, the angle at B between D and A.

3. MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,C),60): This is ∠BDC, the angle at D between B and C.

4. MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,D),Sub(Mul(3,x),6)): This is ∠ACD, the angle at C between A and D.

5. MeasureOf(Angle(D,A,B),Mul(5,y)): This is ∠DAB, the angle at A between D and B.

So, ∠DAB =5y, which is at A. Also, ∠BAC is part of ∠DAB? Wait, if we look at point A, with segments AB, AD, and AC (the diagonal). So ∠DAB is the angle between DA and AB. But ∠BAC is the angle between BA and CA. So if we consider triangle ABC, ∠BAC is part of angle at A.

Wait, perhaps breaking down the angles at each vertex.

Let me focus on vertex A. At vertex A, we have angle DAB =5y. Also, there's angle BAC =x+4. Depending on the position of diagonal AC, this splits the angle at A into two parts. But since ABCD is a parallelogram, AB is parallel to CD, and AD is parallel to BC. So, the diagonal AC divides the parallelogram into two triangles. 

In triangle ABC, we have angle at A (∠BAC =x+4), and angle at B (∠ABC). Also, in triangle ADC, we have angle at C (∠ACD =3x-6).

But how do these relate to the overall angles of the parallelogram?

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, ∠DAB = ∠BCD =5y, and ∠ABC = ∠ADC. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary. So ∠DAB + ∠ABC = 180°, hence ∠ABC = 180° - 5y.

Similarly, ∠ADC = ∠ABC = 180° -5y.

But ∠ADC is composed of angles from the diagonal. Let me think. At point D, angle ADC is split by diagonal BD into two angles: ∠ADB and ∠BDC. Wait, ∠BDC is given as 60°, which is part of angle ADC. So ∠ADC = ∠ADB + ∠BDC. Since ∠BDC is 60°, then ∠ADB = ∠ADC - 60°. But ∠ADC is 180° -5y. So ∠ADB = 180 -5y -60 = 120 -5y.

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. Let me think about triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, we have angle at B (∠DBA =55°), angle at D (∠ADB = 120 -5y), and angle at A (∠BAD =5y). Wait, but ∠BAD is the same as ∠DAB =5y. So in triangle ABD, the three angles should add up to 180°. Therefore:

∠DBA + ∠BAD + ∠ADB = 180°
⇒ 55 + 5y + (120 -5y) = 180
Simplify: 55 + 120 = 175, which equals 180? No, 175 ≠ 180. There's a discrepancy here. That suggests an error in assumptions.

Wait, this indicates a mistake in my breakdown. Let me double-check. 

At point D, angle ADC is composed of ∠ADB and ∠BDC. But if BD is a diagonal, then yes. So ∠ADC = ∠ADB + ∠BDC. Given that ∠BDC =60°, so ∠ADB = ∠ADC -60°. But ∠ADC is equal to ∠ABC, which is 180° -5y. So ∠ADB = (180 -5y) -60 = 120 -5y. Then in triangle ABD, the angles are:

At B: ∠DBA =55°, 
At A: ∠BAD =5y,
At D: ∠ADB =120 -5y.

Summing these: 55 +5y +120 -5y = 175. But this should equal 180. So 175=180? Contradiction. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here, implying that my earlier assumption is wrong.

Hmm, this suggests that either my identification of ∠ADC being 180 -5y is incorrect, or there's another factor I'm missing. Alternatively, maybe the given angles don't directly correspond to the standard parallelogram angles. Perhaps some of the given angles are not the standard internal angles of the parallelogram, but rather other angles formed by the diagonals.

For example, ∠BAC is not an internal angle of the parallelogram, but an angle formed by a diagonal. Similarly, ∠BDC is also formed by a diagonal. So maybe I need to consider triangles created by the diagonals.

Let me try a different approach. Since the diagonals intersect at E, and in a parallelogram, they bisect each other. So AE = EC and BE = ED. Also, the diagonals divide the parallelogram into four triangles. 

Consider triangles ABE and CDE, which are congruent. Also, triangles AED and BEC are congruent. But how does this help with angles?

Alternatively, let's look at triangle ABC. In this triangle, we have angle at A: ∠BAC =x+4. What about other angles?

But we need more information about the triangle. Maybe using the Law of Sines or Cosines? But without knowing sides, it's challenging.

Alternatively, focusing on the angles given. Let me consider the angles at various points.

We have ∠DBA =55°, which is part of angle at B. In the parallelogram, the total angle at B is ∠ABC. How is ∠ABC composed? It includes ∠ABD and ∠DBC. Since BD is a diagonal, splitting ∠ABC into two parts. So ∠ABD = ∠DBA =55°, and ∠DBC is another angle. But what is ∠DBC?

In the parallelogram, since AB || CD, and BD is a transversal, then ∠ABD and ∠CDB are alternate interior angles. Wait, if AB || CD, then ∠ABD (at B) and ∠CDB (at D) should be equal. But ∠CDB is given as 60°, so ∠ABD should be 60°. But the problem states ∠DBA =55°, which contradicts this. Unless my understanding is wrong.

Wait, this is critical. If AB || CD, and BD is a transversal, then ∠ABD (at B) and ∠CDB (at D) are alternate interior angles. Therefore, they should be equal. But the problem states that ∠DBA (which is ∠ABD) is 55°, and ∠BDC (which is ∠CDB) is 60°. This implies that 55° =60°, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation.

Ah! Here's the mistake. The angle ∠BDC is not necessarily an alternate interior angle. Let me re-examine the configuration.

Points: A, B, C, D forming a parallelogram. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at E. So, BD connects B to D. Now, AB is parallel to CD. So, BD is a diagonal crossing from B to D. The angle ∠ABD is at point B, between A and D. The angle ∠CDB is at point D, between C and B. Are these alternate interior angles?

Yes, if AB || CD, and BD is a transversal. So, ∠ABD and ∠CDB are alternate interior angles. Therefore, they should be equal. But the problem states that ∠ABD =55° and ∠CDB =60°, which are unequal. This contradiction suggests that either the problem has conflicting data, or my interpretation is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. So this condition must hold. Therefore, the given angles must comply with the parallelogram properties. Hence, this contradiction suggests that the only way for ∠ABD = ∠CDB is if 55°=60°, which is false. Therefore, there must be an error in my analysis.

Let me rethink. Perhaps the angle ∠CDB is not an alternate interior angle. Let me visualize the parallelogram again. Suppose ABCD is a parallelogram with AB || CD and AD || BC. Diagonals AC and BD intersect at E. So, the diagonal BD goes from B to D. Now, considering AB || CD, and BD is a transversal cutting AB at B and CD at D. So, the alternate interior angles would be ∠ABD (between AB and BD) and ∠CDB (between CD and BD). Hence, they should be equal. Therefore, ∠ABD = ∠CDB. But the problem states that ∠ABD is 55° and ∠CDB is 60°, which are unequal. This is a contradiction unless the given data is inconsistent, which can't be the case. Hence, there must be a miscalculation.

Wait, but the problem says that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, so the given angles must satisfy the properties. This suggests that my previous conclusion that x=5 from the equation x+4=3x-6 is invalid because it leads to a contradiction in the angles. Therefore, I need to find x such that both the equation holds and the parallelogram properties are satisfied.

So, the initial equation was x +4 = 3x -6 → x=5. But substituting x=5 causes contradictions in the angle measures. Therefore, perhaps there's an error in assuming that the equation x+4=3x-6 is independent of the parallelogram properties. Instead, the equation might come from combining the parallelogram properties with the given angle measures.

Let me revisit the equations. The problem gives:

Equals(Add(x,4),Sub(Mul(3,x),6)) → x +4 =3x -6 → x=5.

And Equals(Mul(5,y),55) → y=11.

However, these equations are derived from the given predicates. But perhaps these equations are not standalone; they are derived from the relationships within the parallelogram. So, maybe these equations are not separate but are part of the system that must be satisfied along with the parallelogram properties.

Wait, but the problem says to find x such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. So, the equations given are part of the setup, and we have to find x that satisfies both the equations and the parallelogram conditions.

Earlier, I found that with x=5, there's a contradiction in angles. So, perhaps there's another equation that links x and y, derived from the parallelogram properties, which I haven't considered yet.

Let me try to derive another equation. Let's go back to the angle relations. Earlier, I had a contradiction in triangle ABD. Let me try again, carefully.

In parallelogram ABCD, diagonals AC and BD intersect at E. 

At point B, the angle is ∠ABC. This is split into ∠ABD and ∠DBC by diagonal BD. Given that ∠ABD =55°, and ∠CDB =60°. From the parallelogram property, ∠ABD = ∠CDB (alternate interior angles), but this gives 55=60, which is impossible. Hence, this suggests that the given angles are not consistent with the parallelogram, unless there's another explanation.

Wait, perhaps the angle ∠CDB is not the alternate interior angle. Let me check again. If AB || CD, and BD is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would be ∠ABD and ∠CDB. So, they should be equal. Hence, this contradiction implies that the given data is inconsistent unless... unless the parallelogram is not convex? Or perhaps the diagonal is not intersecting inside the parallelogram? No, in a parallelogram, diagonals always intersect inside.

Alternatively, maybe the given angles are not the ones I thought. Let me recheck the angle definitions.

MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,C),60) → This is ∠BDC, which is at D, between B and C. So, it's angle CDB, which is at D. So, if AB || CD, and BD is the transversal, then ∠ABD (at B) and ∠CDB (at D) are alternate interior angles. Hence, they should be equal. But given as 55 and 60, which are unequal. Hence, contradiction.

This suggests that there is no such parallelogram with these given angles. But since the problem asks to find x, there must be a solution. So, where is the error?

Maybe the angle ∠BDC is not an alternate interior angle. Let me think differently. Perhaps the diagonal BD is not acting as a transversal for AB || CD, but instead for AD || BC? Let me see.

AD is parallel to BC. So, if we consider diagonal BD, it connects B to D. Now, AD || BC, so BD is a transversal for AD and BC. Let me see: at point D, the angle between AD and BD is ∠ADB, and at point B, the angle between BC and BD is ∠CBD. These would be alternate interior angles if AD || BC. So, ∠ADB = ∠CBD.

But ∠ADB is part of angle ADC, which is 180 -5y. And ∠CBD is part of angle at B, which is ∠ABC =180 -5y. So, if ∠ADB = ∠CBD, then perhaps this helps.

But how does this relate to the given ∠BDC =60°? Let me try to connect these.

Let me consider triangle BCD. In triangle BCD, we know ∠BDC =60°. Also, ∠BCD is part of the parallelogram. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, ∠BCD = ∠DAB =5y. So, ∠BCD =5y. In triangle BCD, the angles are ∠BDC=60°, ∠BCD=5y, and ∠CBD. Sum of angles in triangle: 60 +5y + ∠CBD =180 → ∠CBD =120 -5y.

But from the alternate interior angles, ∠ADB = ∠CBD =120 -5y. Also, ∠ADB is part of angle ADC, which is 180 -5y. So, ∠ADC = ∠ADB + ∠BDC = (120 -5y) +60 = 180 -5y. Which checks out. So this doesn't give new information.

Now, going back to triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, we have angles at A, B, D: ∠BAD =5y, ∠ABD=55°, and ∠ADB=120 -5y. Sum is 5y +55 +120 -5y = 175°, which is not 180. This still leaves a discrepancy of 5°. Where is this coming from?

Ah! This suggests that there is an error in the assumption that ∠ADB =120 -5y. Let me re-examine. 

Earlier, we said ∠ADB = ∠CBD =120 -5y. But if ∠CBD =120 -5y, and ∠ADB = ∠CBD, then ∠ADB =120 -5y. But in triangle ABD, the sum of angles is 5y +55 + (120 -5y) = 175. This implies that there's an extra 5° somewhere. 

This suggests that there's an error in the calculation. Let me check the steps again.

In triangle BCD, angles are ∠BDC=60°, ∠BCD=5y, and ∠CBD. So ∠CBD = 180 -60 -5y = 120 -5y. Correct.

From alternate interior angles, ∠ADB = ∠CBD =120 -5y. Correct.

Then, in triangle ABD, angles are ∠BAD=5y, ∠ABD=55°, ∠ADB=120 -5y. Their sum is 5y +55 + (120 -5y) = 175°. This suggests that there's an error in the assumption that ∠ADB = ∠CBD. Why?

Because ∠ADB is not necessarily equal to ∠CBD. Wait, why did I assume that? Because AD || BC, and BD is a transversal, making ∠ADB and ∠CBD alternate interior angles. But if BD crosses AD and BC, then yes, ∠ADB and ∠CBD are alternate interior angles. Hence, they should be equal. But this leads to inconsistency.

Unless the parallelogram is not convex? Or perhaps the diagonal BD is not a transversal? No, in a parallelogram, diagonals are inside.

This contradiction implies that the given data is inconsistent, but since the problem exists, there must be a resolution. Perhaps the error lies in misidentifying the angles. Let me re-express all given angles and their positions.

Let me try to write down all the angles and their locations:

1. ∠BAC = x+4: at A, between B and C.
2. ∠DBA =55°: at B, between D and A.
3. ∠BDC =60°: at D, between B and C.
4. ∠ACD =3x-6: at C, between A and D.
5. ∠DAB =5y: at A, between D and B.

Now, let's consider triangle ABC. In this triangle, we have ∠BAC =x+4, and we might need to find other angles. Also, in triangle ADC, we have ∠ACD =3x-6.

In parallelogram ABCD, AB || CD, so ∠BAC and ∠ACD might be related. For example, since AB || CD, and AC is a transversal, then ∠BAC and ∠ACD are alternate interior angles. Wait, is that true?

Yes! If AB || CD and AC is a transversal, then ∠BAC (at A) and ∠ACD (at C) are alternate interior angles. Hence, they should be equal. So ∠BAC = ∠ACD → x+4 =3x -6 → x+4=3x-6 → x=5. This is the same equation as before!

So this equation comes from the fact that ∠BAC and ∠ACD are alternate interior angles, hence equal. So this gives x=5. But earlier, this led to inconsistencies in the angles at other points. Why?

Let me substitute x=5 into the angles:

∠BAC =5+4=9°, ∠ACD=3*5-6=9°, so they are equal. Good.

Now, let's check the other angles. We also have ∠DAB=5y=55°, so y=11.

Now, let's examine the angles at point B and D.

At point B, we have ∠ABD=55°, which is part of ∠ABC. Also, since AB || CD, and BD is a transversal, ∠ABD and ∠CDB are alternate interior angles. Hence, ∠ABD = ∠CDB → 55° =60°, which is a contradiction. But this suggests that with x=5, this condition is violated.

But wait, this is a contradiction. So how is this possible? The problem states that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, so this condition must hold. Hence, there's a conflict.

Wait, but if ∠BAC = ∠ACD =9°, and the rest of the angles are determined, perhaps there's a way to resolve this contradiction. Let me try to calculate other angles.

Let's consider triangle ABC. In triangle ABC, we have ∠BAC =9°, and we need to find other angles. Let's find ∠ABC and ∠ACB.

But to do this, we need more information. Let me consider the entire parallelogram.

Since ABCD is a parallelogram, ∠ABC = ∠ADC. Also, ∠ADC is composed of ∠ADB + ∠BDC. As before, ∠BDC=60°, so ∠ADB = ∠ADC -60°.

But ∠ADC is equal to ∠ABC. Let's denote ∠ABC = z. Then ∠ADC =z, so ∠ADB = z -60°.

In triangle ABD, we have angles at A: ∠BAD=5y=55°, at B: ∠ABD=55°, at D: ∠ADB=z -60°. Sum of angles: 55 +55 + (z -60) = 55 +55 -60 +z = 50 +z = 180 → z=130°.

So ∠ABC =130°, which means ∠ADC=130°. Hence, ∠ADB =130 -60 =70°.

Now, let's check the sum of angles in triangle ABD: 55 +55 +70 =180. Yes, this works. So this resolves the earlier contradiction. How?

Because earlier, I incorrectly assumed that ∠ADB =120 -5y, but actually, with z=130°, ∠ADB = z -60 =70°, and since z=130°, which came from solving the triangle ABD angles.

Now, let's verify if this fits with other parts of the parallelogram.

Since ∠ABC =130°, and in a parallelogram, consecutive angles are supplementary. So ∠DAB + ∠ABC =55 +130 =185°, which is not 180°. Wait, this is a problem! Consecutive angles in a parallelogram should be supplementary. So this suggests another contradiction.

Wait, what's ∠DAB? It's 5y=55°, and ∠ABC is 130°. Their sum is 185°, not 180°. This violates the parallelogram property. What's wrong here?

Ah! This suggests another inconsistency. Let me trace back. Earlier, I found that z=130°, which is ∠ABC. But in a parallelogram, ∠ABC should be supplementary to ∠DAB. So ∠ABC = 180 -55 =125°. But according to our calculation, it's 130°. Hence, another contradiction.

Where is the mistake? Let me re-examine the calculation of z.

In triangle ABD, angles are:

∠BAD =55°, ∠ABD=55°, ∠ADB=70°, totaling 180°. This gives z =130°, which is ∠ABC. But according to parallelogram properties, ∠ABC should be 180 -55 =125°. Hence, this is a contradiction.

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent, but since the problem asks for a solution, I must have missed something. Let me try to find another relation.

Let me consider the sum of all angles in the parallelogram. The sum should be 360°. With ∠DAB=55°, ∠ABC=130°, ∠BCD=55°, ∠ADC=130°. Total: 55+130+55+130=370°, which exceeds 360°. Clearly wrong.

This indicates that there is a fundamental issue with the given data, but since the problem is posed, there must be a solution. Perhaps the error lies in assuming that ∠BAC and ∠ACD are alternate interior angles. Let me re-examine that.

AB is parallel to CD. Line AC is a transversal. So, ∠BAC (at A) and ∠ACD (at C) are indeed alternate interior angles, hence equal. So x+4=3x-6 → x=5. This is correct.

With x=5, ∠BAC=9°, ∠ACD=9°.

Now, let's try to find the remaining angles.

In triangle ABC, we have ∠BAC=9°, and we need to find other angles. Let's find ∠ABC and ∠ACB.

But we need more information. Let me consider the full parallelogram. Since ∠DAB=55°, and ∠ABC is adjacent to it. In a parallelogram, ∠DAB + ∠ABC =180° → ∠ABC =125°. So, ∠ABC=125°.

But earlier, from triangle ABD, we got ∠ABC=130°, which conflicts. Let me resolve this.

If ∠ABC=125°, then in triangle ABC, the angles are ∠BAC=9°, ∠ABC=125°, so ∠ACB =180 -9 -125 =46°.

Now, ∠ACB is part of ∠BCD. Since ABCD is a parallelogram, ∠BCD=∠DAB=55°. So ∠BCD=55°. But ∠ACB is part of ∠BCD. Let me see.

At point C, ∠BCD is made up of ∠ACB and ∠ACD. So ∠BCD = ∠ACB + ∠ACD. We have ∠ACD=9°, and ∠BCD=55°, so ∠ACB =55 -9=46°, which matches the earlier calculation. So this is consistent.

Thus, ∠ACB=46°.

Now, let's return to triangle ABD. We have ∠ABD=55°, ∠BAD=55°, and ∠ADB=?. Wait, previously, I calculated ∠ADB as 70°, but let's recalculate it.

In triangle ABD, the angles are ∠BAD=55°, ∠ABD=55°, and ∠ADB. So, sum is 55 +55 + ∠ADB =180 → ∠ADB=70°.

Now, ∠ADB is part of ∠ADC. Since ∠ADC=180 - ∠DAB =180 -55=125°. So ∠ADC=125°, which is composed of ∠ADB + ∠BDC =70 +60=130°. Wait, this gives 130°, but ∠ADC should be 125°. Another contradiction!

Wait, this suggests that ∠ADB + ∠BDC =70 +60=130°, but ∠ADC=125°. Hence, contradiction.

What's the source of this inconsistency? Let me check ∠ADC. In a parallelogram, ∠ADC should be equal to ∠ABC=125°. But according to the diagonal, it's ∠ADB + ∠BDC=70 +60=130°. This suggests that there's an error in the calculation of ∠ADB.

Wait, but earlier, we had ∠ADB = z -60°, where z=∠ABC=125°, so ∠ADB=125 -60=65°. But previously, from triangle ABD, we calculated ∠ADB=70°. This discrepancy indicates an error.

Let me re-calculate ∠ADB. If ∠ABC=125°, and ∠ABD=55°, then ∠CBD=∠ABC - ∠ABD =125 -55=70°. Since AD || BC, ∠ADB = ∠CBD=70° (alternate interior angles). Hence, ∠ADB=70°. Then ∠ADC=∠ADB + ∠BDC=70 +60=130°. But according to parallelogram properties, ∠ADC should be 125°. This is a contradiction.

This suggests that the given data is inconsistent, but since the problem asks for a solution, there must be a different approach. Let me reconsider the initial equations.

We have two equations:

1. x +4 =3x -6 → x=5.
2. 5y=55 → y=11.

These are derived from the given predicates, and they must hold. Even though they lead to contradictions in angle sums, perhaps the problem assumes that these equations are correct, and the inconsistencies arise from other factors. 

But the question asks to find x such that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram. Given that x=5 is the solution to the equation derived from the alternate interior angles, and despite the apparent contradictions in other angles, perhaps the correct answer is x=5, corresponding to choice B.

But earlier, when x=5, we have ∠ADC=130°, but it should be 125°. This suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, but since the options include x=5 (choice B), and the equation x+4=3x-6 leads to x=5, it's likely that this is the intended answer, even though there are inconsistencies in the angle measures. Perhaps the problem assumes that the given angles are part of the parallelogram's properties, and the contradictions are resolved through other means.

Alternatively, perhaps the measure of ∠BDC is not 60°, but another angle. Let me check the original problem statement again.

Original problem: MeasureOf(Angle(B,D,C),60). So it's ∠BDC=60°, which we've used.

Given that, and the derived x=5, even with the contradictions, the correct answer is x=5, which is choice B. Hence, the Final Answer is B.
