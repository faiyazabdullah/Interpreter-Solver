MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have two parallel lines, a and b. Angles 1, 2, and 4 are given with measures 158°, 42°, and 50° respectively. We need to find the measure of angle 3. 

First, I should recall that when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, several angle relationships come into play. Like corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Also, vertical angles are equal. But since there are three angles given here, maybe they form some sort of triangle or intersecting lines?

Wait, but the problem mentions angle 1, 2, 3, and 4. Maybe these angles are formed by a transversal crossing the two parallel lines? Let me visualize this. Suppose line a and line b are horizontal, and a transversal crosses them, creating various angles. Depending on where the angles are placed, their measures could relate.

Given that angle 1 is 158°, which is quite large, almost a straight line. Angle 2 is 42°, and angle 4 is 50°. Since lines a and b are parallel, if angle 1 and angle 2 are on the same side, maybe they are consecutive interior angles? Wait, consecutive interior angles add up to 180°. But angle 1 is 158°, so if it were consecutive with another angle, that other angle would be 22°, but angle 2 is 42°, so that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are on different sides. For example, if angle 1 is on one line and angle 2 is on the other line, perhaps forming a 'Z' shape? Or maybe they're part of a triangle?

Wait, maybe there are two transversals? Because angle 4 is also mentioned. Let me think. If there are two transversals, creating more than two intersection points, leading to more angles. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved where some angles are given.

Another thought: sometimes when dealing with parallel lines, you can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, or that in a triangle, angles add up to 180°. Let's consider each possibility.

Let me sketch mentally. Imagine two parallel lines, a and b. Let's say a transversal intersects line a at point A and line b at point B, creating angles. Another transversal might intersect them too. But without seeing the diagram, it's tricky. However, the angles given are 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe angles 1 and 2 are adjacent, forming a linear pair with another angle?

Wait, angle 1 is 158°, which is obtuse. If that's a corresponding angle to another angle, then its supplement would be 22°, but angle 2 is 42°, which doesn't align. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are on different transversals. Let me think about the possibilities.

Suppose angle 1 is an exterior angle on line a, and angle 2 is an interior angle on line b. Then, because the lines are parallel, maybe those angles are supplementary? But again, 158 + 42 = 200, which isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are vertical angles? No, vertical angles are equal, but 158 ≠ 42. Not possible.

Wait, perhaps angle 1 and angle 4 are related. If angle 4 is 50°, then maybe angle 1 and angle 4 are supplementary? 158 + 50 = 208, still not helpful. 

Hmm, maybe considering triangle angles. Suppose there's a triangle where some angles are given. For instance, if angle 1 is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the remote interior angles. But angle 1 is 158°, so if it's an exterior angle, then the two non-adjacent angles inside the triangle would add up to 158°. But we have angle 2 as 42°, which could be one of them. Then the other would be 158 - 42 = 116°, but I don't see how that connects to angle 4 being 50°.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is part of a triangle with angles 2 and 4? Let me check. If angles 2 and 4 are in a triangle, their sum is 42 + 50 = 92°, leaving angle 3 as 88°, but that's not among the options. Wait, but the answer choices are A:50, B:60, C:70, D:80. So maybe that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the angles are arranged such that angle 1 and angle 2 are on a straight line, making them supplementary. But 158 + 42 = 200, which is not 180. That's not possible. Unless there's another angle involved.

Wait, maybe there's a transversal cutting across the two parallel lines, creating angles. Let me try to label them. Let's assume that angle 1 is on line a, and angle 2 is on line b. Since the lines are parallel, certain angles would be congruent. For example, if angle 1 is a corresponding angle to angle 2, then they'd be equal. But 158 ≠ 42, so that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 2 are consecutive interior angles, which would make them supplementary. So 158 + 42 = 200, which is not 180. Therefore, that's not possible either.

Wait, maybe angle 1 is an exterior angle, and angle 2 is an interior angle. Then, if they are on the same side, they would be supplementary. But again, 158 + 42 = 200. Not matching. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle formed by the two parallel lines and a transversal. Let me think. Suppose a triangle has one vertex on line a, one on line b, and one on the transversal. But I'm getting confused without the actual diagram.

Wait, angle 4 is 50°, which is given. Maybe angle 4 is an alternate interior angle with another angle. If lines a and b are parallel, then alternate interior angles are equal. So if angle 4 is 50°, then its alternate interior angle would also be 50°. Maybe that angle is connected to others.

Alternatively, let's think about the sum of angles around a point. If angles 1, 2, and 4 are around a point, but I don't know their positions. 

Wait, maybe angle 3 is related to angles 1, 2, and 4 via triangle angle sums or something else. Let me try another approach. 

Since lines a and b are parallel, any transversal will create corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, etc. Suppose there's a transversal that creates angle 1 (158°) and angle 2 (42°). Let's imagine that angle 1 is on line a, and angle 2 is on line b. If angle 1 and angle 2 are on the same side of the transversal, then they would be consecutive interior angles, adding up to 180°. But 158 + 42 = 200, which is way over 180. So that can't be. 

But wait, maybe angle 1 is an exterior angle and angle 2 is an interior angle. Then, the exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. Suppose angle 1 (exterior) is equal to the sum of two interior angles. If angle 1 is 158°, then the two interior angles would add to 158. One of them could be angle 2 (42°), then the other would be 158 - 42 = 116°. But how does that relate to angle 4 being 50°?

Alternatively, angle 4 could be one of those interior angles. Suppose angle 4 is 50°, which would mean that the other interior angle is 158 - 50 = 108°, but again, not sure how that helps.

Wait, maybe there are two transversals creating multiple angles. For instance, if there's a triangle formed by two transversals and the parallel lines. Let me consider that scenario. Suppose two transversals cross the parallel lines, forming a triangle. In that case, the angles inside the triangle would be related to the angles given.

For example, suppose angle 1 is outside the triangle, angle 2 and angle 4 are inside, and angle 3 is another angle. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is vertically opposite to angle 4, making it 50°, but that would make answer A, but I need to verify.

Wait, but angle 4 is 50°, and if angle 3 is vertical to it, then yes, but why would that be the case? It depends on how the lines intersect.

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is supplementary to angle 2. If angle 2 is 42°, then angle 3 would be 180 - 42 = 138°, which isn't an option. 

Hmm. This is confusing. Let me think again. Since lines a and b are parallel, and there are four angles given: 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe these angles are part of a polygon or a set of intersecting lines. 

Wait, if we consider that angle 1 and angle 4 are on the same transversal, maybe they are supplementary. For example, if angle 1 is on one line and angle 4 is on the other, then they could be consecutive interior angles, which would add up to 180. But angle 1 is 158°, so angle 4 would be 22°, but angle 4 is given as 50°, which contradicts that. 

Alternatively, angle 1 and angle 4 could be corresponding angles, making them equal. But angle 1 is 158°, angle 4 is 50°, so that's not the case. 

Maybe angle 1 is a vertical angle with another angle, which is supplementary to angle 2. For example, if angle 1 is vertical to an angle that forms a linear pair with angle 2. Let me try. If angle 1 is vertical to an angle x, then x = 158°. If x and angle 2 (42°) form a linear pair, then x + 42 = 180 → x = 138°, but that doesn't match 158°. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe angle 1 is part of a triangle with angles 2 and 4. For instance, if angle 1 is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles. So angle 1 = angle 2 + angle 4. Let's check: 158 = 42 + 50 → 92. No, that doesn't work. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 and angle 4 are parts of a triangle with angle 3. For example, if angles 2 and 4 are two angles in a triangle, then angle 3 would be 180 - (42 + 50) = 88°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, maybe there's a quadrilateral involved. If the angles are part of a quadrilateral, the sum of angles would be 360°. But we have three angles given: 158, 42, 50. Adding them gives 158+42=200, plus 50 is 250. So the fourth angle would be 360-250=110°, which is not listed. 

This is perplexing. Let me think about the standard problems involving parallel lines and angles. Often, there are cases where you have a transversal creating angles, and you can find missing angles using supplementary or congruent pairs. 

Let me try to assign labels. Assume lines a and b are parallel, crossed by two transversals, creating eight angles. Let me denote the angles as follows: suppose the first transversal creates angles 1 and 2, and the second transversal creates angles 3 and 4. Wait, but the problem says angles 1, 2, 3, 4. Maybe they are labeled sequentially around the intersection points. 

Alternatively, consider that angles 1 and 2 are on one transversal, while angles 3 and 4 are on another. Let me think. For instance, if angle 1 and angle 2 are on one transversal, then angle 3 and angle 4 on another. 

But how do these relate? Let me try to imagine two transversals crossing the parallel lines, creating a 'X' shape. In that case, vertical angles would be equal, and corresponding angles would be equal. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle formed by extending lines. For example, if line a and line b are parallel, and a third line intersects them, forming a triangle with angles involving 1, 2, 3, 4. 

Wait, here's an idea: suppose there's a triangle where one angle is angle 1 (158°), and another angle is angle 2 (42°), and angle 3 is the third angle. Then the sum would be 158 + 42 + angle 3 = 180 → angle 3 = 180 - 200 = -20°, which is impossible. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 is an exterior angle of a triangle, and angle 2 and angle 4 are the remote interior angles. Then, angle 1 = angle 2 + angle 4 → 158 = 42 + 50 = 92. No, that doesn't hold. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 4 are on different transversals, and angle 2 and angle 3 are on another. Let me think about supplementary angles. 

If angle 1 is 158°, which is obtuse, then its supplementary angle would be 22°. If angle 2 is 42°, which is acute, and angle 4 is 50°, which is also acute. Perhaps angle 3 is the difference between some angles. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is formed by the intersection of the two transversals. For example, if two transversals intersect, creating vertical angles. If one of those vertical angles is angle 3, and another is angle 4 (50°), then angle 3 would be 50°, which is option A. But why would that be the case? 

Wait, but the problem states that there are four angles: 1, 2, 3, 4. So maybe angle 3 is vertical to angle 4, hence equal. But then angle 3 would be 50°, which is answer A. But why would angle 3 be vertical to angle 4? That depends on the diagram. Without seeing the diagram, it's hard to tell, but maybe the setup is such that angles 3 and 4 are vertical angles. 

Alternatively, angle 3 could be supplementary to angle 2. If angle 2 is 42°, then angle 3 would be 180 - 42 = 138°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, maybe angle 3 is part of a triangle with angles 2 and 4. If angle 2 and angle 4 are two angles of a triangle, then the third angle (angle 3) would be 180 - (42 + 50) = 88°, which isn't an option. 

Hmm. This is really challenging. Let me go back to basics. Given that lines a and b are parallel, and angles 1, 2, 4 are given. What's the relationship between these angles?

Perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are on the same transversal, making them supplementary or congruent. But earlier calculations showed they don't add up to 180. 

Wait, angle 1 is 158°, which is close to 180°. If it's a straight angle minus something. Suppose angle 1 is a straight angle (180°), but it's given as 158°, so there's a 22° gap. Maybe that relates to another angle. 

Alternatively, angle 1 and angle 2 are adjacent angles forming a larger angle. For example, angle 1 + angle 2 = 158 + 42 = 200°, which is more than 180°, so that can't be. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 is vertical to an angle that is supplementary to angle 2. Let me think. If angle 1 is vertical to angle x, then x = 158°. If x and angle 2 form a linear pair, then x + angle 2 = 180 → 158 + angle 2 = 180 → angle 2 = 22°, but angle 2 is given as 42°, so that doesn't fit. 

I'm stuck. Maybe I need to consider that angle 3 is formed by the intersection of two transversals, and uses the given angles in some way. 

Wait, here's a new idea: maybe angle 1 and angle 4 are corresponding angles, so they are equal. But angle 1 is 158°, angle 4 is 50°, which aren't equal. So that's not possible. 

Alternatively, angle 1 and angle 4 are supplementary. 158 + 50 = 208, which is not 180. 

Wait, angle 2 and angle 4: 42 + 50 = 92. Not sure. 

Maybe angle 3 is related to angle 1 and angle 2 through some triangle. Let me try to think of a scenario where three angles are in a triangle. For example, if angle 1 is an exterior angle, and angles 2 and 3 are interior angles. Then, angle 1 = angle 2 + angle 3. So 158 = 42 + angle 3 → angle 3 = 116°, which isn't an option. 

Alternatively, if angle 3 is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the remote interior angles. Suppose angle 3 = angle 2 + angle 4 → 42 + 50 = 92°, so angle 3 would be 92°, not in the options. 

Wait, maybe angle 3 is part of a different triangle. For example, if angle 1 and angle 4 are part of one triangle, and angle 2 and angle 3 are part of another. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a parallelogram involved. In a parallelogram, opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let's try to look for patterns. The given angles are 158°, 42°, and 50°. The answer choices are 50°, 60°, 70°, 80°. Notice that 158° is very close to 180°, which suggests it's an obtuse angle. Maybe angle 1 is supplementary to another angle. For example, if angle 1 is 158°, then its supplement is 22°. Maybe that 22° is part of another angle relation. 

If angle 1 and angle 2 are on the same side of the transversal, then they are consecutive interior angles and should add up to 180°. But 158 + 42 = 200, which is too much. However, if there's another angle involved. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 is 158°, and angle 2 is 42°, and angle 4 is 50°, and they are all part of a triangle. Let me check the total. If angle 1 is 158°, then the other two angles would need to add up to 22°, but 42 and 50 add up to 92. Doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 and angle 4 are part of a triangle with angle 3. As before, that gives angle 3 as 88°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, maybe angle 3 is formed by the intersection of two transversals, and uses the given angles through vertical angles or supplements. For example, if angle 3 is vertical to angle 4, then it's 50°, which is option A. But why would that be the case? 

Assuming that angle 3 and angle 4 are vertical angles, then angle 3 would be 50°, making the answer A. But I'm not sure if that's the case without the diagram. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is supplementary to angle 2. If angle 2 is 42°, then angle 3 would be 138°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, another approach: maybe the angles are in a star pattern, like a pentagon or something. But that seems unlikely. 

Wait, here's a thought: since lines a and b are parallel, and assuming that angle 1 and angle 4 are on the same transversal, then they could be corresponding or alternate angles. But angle 1 is 158°, angle 4 is 50°, so they wouldn't be equal. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 4 are on different transversals, maybe forming a triangle. 

At this point, I'm running out of ideas. Let me consider the answer choices. The options are 50°, 60°, 70°, 80°. Angle 4 is already 50°, so if angle 3 is equal to angle 4, then it's 50°, which is option A. But why would they be equal? If they are vertical angles or corresponding angles. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is supplementary to angle 2. 42° supplementary would be 138°, not an option. 

Or maybe angle 3 is the difference between angle 1 and angle 2. 158 - 42 = 116°, not an option. 

Wait, what if angle 3 is the supplement of angle 4? 180 - 50 = 130°, not an option. 

Alternatively, angle 3 is the supplement of angle 1. 180 - 158 = 22°, not an option. 

Hmm. This is really tough without the diagram. But since angle 4 is 50°, and angle 3 might be related to it, maybe the answer is A:50°. But I'm not confident. 

Wait, let me think again about the initial assumption. If lines a and b are parallel, and there's a transversal creating angles. Suppose angle 1 is on one side, and angle 4 is on the other, making them corresponding angles, but since they are not equal, that's not possible. 

Wait, maybe angle 1 and angle 4 are on the same side of the transversal, making them supplementary. So 158 + 50 = 208, which is not 180. 

Wait, but if there are two transversals, maybe angle 1 and angle 4 are on different transversals. 

Another idea: if there's a triangle formed by the two parallel lines and a transversal, making a triangle with angles 1, 2, and 3. Let's say angle 1 is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles. Suppose angle 1 = angle 2 + angle 3. So 158 = 42 + angle 3 → angle 3 = 116°, not an option. 

Alternatively, if angle 2 is an exterior angle, then angle 2 = angle 1 + angle 3 → 42 = 158 + angle 3 → angle 3 = -116°, impossible. 

Wait, what if angle 3 is an exterior angle, and angle 2 and angle 4 are the remote interior angles? Then angle 3 = angle 2 + angle 4 → 42 + 50 = 92°, so angle 3 = 92°, not an option. 

I'm really stuck. Maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think about the possible configurations again. 

Perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are on different transversals, and angle 3 and 4 are on another. For example, if there are two transversals intersecting the parallel lines, creating a series of angles. 

In this case, angle 1 could be a corresponding angle to angle 4, but since they are not equal, that's not possible. 

Wait, but if angle 1 is on one transversal and angle 4 is on another, maybe they are alternate interior angles. But alternate interior angles would be equal, so 158° = 50°, which is false. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 1 and angle 4 are supplementary due to being consecutive interior angles on different transversals. But again, 158 + 50 = 208, not 180. 

Wait, I'm starting to think that the correct answer is A:50°, because angle 4 is 50°, and angle 3 might be vertical to it. Even though I can't confirm without the diagram, this is the only option that directly matches one of the given angles. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 is part of a triangle with angles 2 and 4, giving 180 - 42 - 50 = 88°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, but 88° is close to 90°, and maybe there's a miscalculation. Wait, 42 + 50 = 92, so angle 3 would be 88°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, unless there's a typo in my thinking. Let me recheck: 180 - 42 - 50 = 88. Correct. 

So none of the options match 88. 

Wait, maybe angle 3 is the supplement of angle 4? 180 - 50 = 130°, not an option. 

Wait, what if angle 3 is formed by the intersection of two lines, and it's supplementary to angle 2? 180 - 42 = 138°, not an option. 

Hmm. At this point, I'm forced to reconsider. Perhaps the answer is 80°, option D, because 158 - 42 - 50 = 66°, no. Wait, not sure. 

Wait, another approach: if angle 1 is 158°, then its adjacent angle would be 180 - 158 = 22°. Maybe that 22° is related to angle 2 or 4. For example, if angle 2 is 42°, and angle 4 is 50°, then 22 + 42 = 64°, and 50° is given. Not sure. 

Wait, if angle 1 is 158°, then its adjacent angle is 22°, which could be part of another angle. If angle 2 is 42°, and angle 4 is 50°, then maybe angle 3 is 22° + 50° = 72°, which is not an option. 

Alternatively, angle 3 = 180 - 42 - 50 = 88°, which isn't an option. 

Wait, I'm really stuck. Maybe the answer is A:50°, even though I can't fully justify it. Or maybe I missed something. 

Wait, let me think about the possibility that angle 3 is the supplement of angle 1. 180 - 158 = 22°, but that's not an option. 

Wait, what if angle 3 is formed by the intersection of two lines, one of which is a transversal, and it's supplementary to angle 2. So 180 - 42 = 138°, not an option. 

I give up. Given that angle 4 is 50°, and if angle 3 is vertical to it, then the answer is A. So I'll choose A:50°.
