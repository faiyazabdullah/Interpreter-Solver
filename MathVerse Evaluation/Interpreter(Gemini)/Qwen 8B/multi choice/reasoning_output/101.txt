MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a circle O with AB as the diameter. Points C and D are on the circle. We know that angle AOC is 126 degrees, and we need to find angle CDB. 

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since AB is the diameter, any angle subtended by AB on the circumference should be a right angle. Wait, but point C isn't necessarily on the semicircle opposite AB unless specified. But since C is on the circle, maybe there's something else here.

Given that angle AOC is 126 degrees. Since OA and OC are radii, because O is the center. So OA = OC. Therefore, triangle AOC is an isosceles triangle with OA = OC. The vertex angle at O is 126 degrees. That means the base angles at A and C would be equal. Let me calculate those. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180, so each base angle is (180 - 126)/2 = 54/2 = 27 degrees. So angle OAC and angle OCA are each 27 degrees. 

But how does this relate to angle CDB? Hmm. Point D is also on the circle. Maybe there's an inscribed angle theorem involved here. Remember that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. 

Let me think about the arcs. Since AB is the diameter, the arc AB is 180 degrees. The angle AOC is 126 degrees, which is a central angle, so it intercepts arc AC. Therefore, arc AC measures 126 degrees. Then, the remaining arc CB would be arc AB minus arc AC. Arc AB is 180 degrees, so arc CB is 180 - 126 = 54 degrees. 

Now, angle CDB is an inscribed angle. Which arc does it intercept? If D is another point on the circle, then angle CDB intercepts arc CB. Because angle at D, so the inscribed angle would intercept arc from C to B. Wait, but depending on where D is located. Wait, the problem says points C and D are on the circle. Are they positioned such that D is somewhere else?

Wait, looking back, there's a line CD and DB. So D connects to C and B. So if I imagine the diagram, points A and B are endpoints of diameter. Point C is somewhere on the circle, making angle AOC 126 degrees. Then D is connected to C and B. So angle CDB is formed by points C, D, B. 

So angle CDB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CB. Since the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Earlier, we found arc CB is 54 degrees. Therefore, angle CDB would be half of that, which is 27 degrees. Wait, but that's one possibility. However, sometimes inscribed angles can intercept different arcs depending on the position of D. 

Wait, but if D is on the circumference, then angle CDB could intercept arc CB or the opposite arc. But since AB is a diameter, and C is fixed, where is D? Let me check the other given lines. There's a line D-B, and line C-D. Also, line B-C exists. So connecting D to B and C. So D is connected to B and C. So maybe D is on the same side as C relative to AB? Or maybe on the opposite side?

Alternatively, perhaps D is positioned such that BD is another chord. But without more info, maybe we need to rely on the fact that angle CDB intercepts arc CB. But wait, if D is on the circumference, then angle CDB would intercept arc CB. So the measure would be half of arc CB, which is 54 degrees divided by 2 equals 27 degrees. So angle CDB is 27 degrees. But looking at the options, option C is 27. But wait, wait—maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.

Wait, the central angle for arc AC is 126 degrees, so arc AC is 126 degrees. Then arc AB is 180 degrees, so arc BC would be 180 - 126 = 54 degrees. Now, angle CDB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc CB. Therefore, angle CDB = ½ × arc CB = ½ × 54 = 27 degrees. So answer C. But wait, let me make sure that D is placed such that angle CDB intercepts arc CB. 

Another thought: Sometimes, when dealing with inscribed angles, the intercepted arc depends on the position of the point. For example, if D were on the opposite side of AB from C, then angle CDB would intercept arc CAB instead. But given that there's a line CD and D is connected to B, maybe D is on the same side as C. Alternatively, maybe the arc intercepted is actually arc CAB. Wait, but arc CAB would be arc CA plus arc AB. Wait, no—if angle CDB intercepts arc CB, then the measure is half of that. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Since AB is the diameter, then angle ACB would be a right angle if C were on the semicircle. But in this case, angle AOC is 126 degrees, so point C is not on the semicircle opposite AB. Wait, no. AB is the diameter, so the entire circle is 360 degrees. The central angle for AB is 180 degrees. So if angle AOC is 126 degrees, then point C is somewhere on the circle such that moving from A to O to C makes that angle. So the arc AC is 126 degrees. 

Then, considering point D. Since there's a line CD and D is connected to B. So if I consider triangle CDB, angle at D. To find angle CDB, which is an inscribed angle. 

Alternatively, maybe using cyclic quadrilaterals. But since all points are on the circle, any quadrilateral formed is cyclic. However, without knowing where D is, maybe it's better to stick with the inscribed angle theorem. 

Wait, another idea: The inscribed angle theorem states that the angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So if angle CDB intercepts arc CB, then yes, it's 54 / 2 = 27. But maybe D is on the opposite side, intercepting the rest of the circle. Wait, but the arc that's opposite would be arc CAB, which would be 360 - arc CB. Wait, no. Let me clarify. 

Arc CB is 54 degrees. The total circle is 360 degrees. So the major arc CB would be 360 - 54 = 306 degrees. But angle CDB would intercept the arc that doesn't contain D. Depending on where D is. If D is on the same side as A, then angle CDB intercepts arc CB. But if D is on the opposite side, it would intercept the major arc. However, since there's a line CD and D is connected to B, maybe D is positioned such that it's on the same side as A. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another relationship. Let me check again. The problem gives that there is a line D-B and line C-D. So D is connected to B and C. So if I imagine the diagram, with AB as diameter, C somewhere on the upper half (assuming standard position), and D connected to C and B. If D is on the lower half, then angle CDB would intercept arc CB. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a property involving angles subtended by the same arc. Wait, but angle AOC is 126 degrees, which is the central angle over arc AC. Then angle ABC would be half of that, but that's if ABC is an inscribed angle. Wait, no. If AB is the diameter, then angle ACB would be 90 degrees if C were on the semicircle. But since C is not on the semicircle, angle ACB is not 90 degrees. 

Alternatively, maybe use coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to visualize. Let’s place O at the origin (0,0). Let’s assume radius r = 1 for simplicity. Then A is (-1,0), B is (1,0). Point C is on the circle such that angle AOC is 126 degrees. So the coordinates of C can be found using polar coordinates. The angle from OA to OC is 126 degrees. So coordinates of C would be (cos(126°), sin(126°)). 

Then, point D is another point on the circle. The line CD connects to D, and line DB connects D to B. So angle CDB is the angle at D between points C and B. 

To find angle CDB, maybe we can compute the arc that it intercepts. Since D is arbitrary on the circle except for being connected to C and B. But since the problem gives that there's a line CD and DB, maybe D is chosen such that it forms a certain configuration. However, without loss of generality, perhaps angle CDB is determined solely by the arc CB. 

Wait, regardless of where D is, as long as it's on the circumference, angle CDB would intercept arc CB. But that's only true if D is on the arc that doesn't contain A. Otherwise, it might intercept the other arc. 

But since AB is the diameter, and C is at 126 degrees from A, then point C is above the x-axis. Suppose D is on the opposite side of AB from C. Then angle CDB would intercept the arc that goes from C to B passing through A. In that case, the intercepted arc would be arc CAB, which would be arc CA + arc AB. Wait, arc CA is 126 degrees, arc AB is 180 degrees, so total would be 126 + 180 = 306 degrees. Then angle CDB would be half of that, which is 153 degrees. But that's larger than 90, which seems unlikely. 

Alternatively, if D is on the same side as C, then angle CDB intercepts arc CB of 54 degrees, giving angle 27 degrees. 

But why would D be on that side? Well, since there's a line CD and DB. If D is connected to C and B, then depending on where D is, but since there's no more information, maybe we need to infer based on the given lines. 

Looking back at the given lines: Line(C,D) and Line(D,B). So D is connected to C and B. So if we imagine the circle with AB as diameter, and C somewhere on the upper half, then D could be on the lower half connected to C and B. Wait, but that would make angle CDB intercept arc CB. 

Alternatively, if D is on the upper half, then angle CDB would intercept arc CB or the rest. 

Hmm. This seems ambiguous. However, in the absence of more information, the standard assumption is that the angle is formed by taking the arc that doesn't contain the point. Wait, but in general, the inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc that is opposite the angle. 

Wait, the intercepted arc is the arc that is not containing the point. So if D is outside the arc CB, then the angle would intercept arc CB. If D is inside the arc, then it would intercept the other arc. 

But given that there's a line CD and DB, maybe D is on the opposite side of AB from C. Let me think. If D is on the opposite side of AB from C, then angle CDB would intercept arc CB. Let me confirm. 

For instance, suppose C is in the upper half-circle. If D is in the lower half-circle, then angle CDB would intercept arc from C to B going through A. Wait, but that's the major arc CB. Wait, but earlier calculation said that arc CB was 54 degrees. But if it's the major arc, then it's 360 - 54 = 306 degrees. Then angle CDB would be half of that, which is 153 degrees. But none of the answer choices are 153. 

Alternatively, maybe the minor arc CB is 54 degrees, and angle CDB intercepts that. So 54/2=27 degrees. Which is option C. 

But how do I know whether D is on the opposite side or not? Maybe the presence of line CD implies that D is connected to C, so if C is on the upper half, D could be anywhere. However, since there's a line from D to B, which is the endpoint of the diameter. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Since angle AOC is 126 degrees, and AB is the diameter. Then, the inscribed angle subtended by arc AC would be half of 126, which is 63 degrees. Wait, but that's angle ABC, if B is on the circumference. Wait, no. Wait, angle ABC would be an inscribed angle subtending arc AC. So angle ABC = ½ arc AC = 63 degrees. 

But how does that relate to angle CDB? Maybe triangle CDB relates to triangle ABC somehow. 

Alternatively, since AB is the diameter, and C is a point on the circle, then angle ACB is 90 degrees. Wait, no! Wait, angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending the diameter AB. Wait, no. Wait, if AB is the diameter, then any point C on the circle forms a right angle at C with AB. So angle ACB is 90 degrees. Wait, but in our case, angle AOC is 126 degrees, so point C is not forming a right angle with AB. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, no, if AB is the diameter, then angle ACB should be a right angle. But according to the previous calculation, angle AOC is 126 degrees, which suggests that arc AC is 126 degrees. So then, angle ACB should be half of arc AB, but that's not directly applicable. Wait, confusion arises. 

Wait, the measure of angle ACB is half the measure of the arc that it subtends. Angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB. Wait, arc AB is 180 degrees. So angle ACB should be 90 degrees. But according to the given angle AOC is 126 degrees. How can both be true? 

Ah, because angle AOC is a central angle subtending arc AC, while angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB. So angle ACB is indeed 90 degrees. But that doesn't conflict with angle AOC being 126 degrees. So point C is located such that arc AC is 126 degrees, and arc CB is 54 degrees. 

Therefore, returning to angle CDB. If D is on the circle, then angle CDB is an inscribed angle subtending arc CB. But if D is on the opposite side of AB from C, then the intercepted arc would be the major arc CB, which is 306 degrees. But that would give angle CDB as 153 degrees, which is not among the choices. Hence, likely that D is on the same side as C, intercepting the minor arc CB of 54 degrees, leading to angle CDB = 27 degrees. 

Thus, the answer is C: 27 degrees. But let me check once more. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relation through triangle CDB. For example, if we connect points, maybe triangle CDB has some relations. 

But without knowing where D is, it's hard to say. However, given that angle AOC is 126 degrees, and AB is the diameter, and D is another point on the circle connected to C and B, the most straightforward conclusion is that angle CDB is half the measure of arc CB, which is 54 degrees. Therefore, 54/2 = 27. So answer C.
