====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have four rays intersecting and forming 16 angles. Two of the rays are parallel. They gave us that angle 3 is 110 degrees and angle 12 is 55 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 1.

First, I should visualize the setup. Four rays intersecting... Hmm, maybe they form a sort of star or something with multiple lines crossing. But since there are two pairs of parallel rays mentioned—like Line(1,2) is parallel to Line(3,4), and also Line(5,6)? Wait, looking back at the predicates, Parallel(Line(1,2),Line(3,4)), Parallel(Line(1,2),Line(5,6)), and Parallel(Line(3,4),Line(5,6)). Oh, so Lines 1-2, 3-4, and 5-6 are all parallel? Wait, but how can three lines be mutually parallel if they're part of different rays?

Wait, maybe the four rays are arranged such that two sets of parallel lines. Like, imagine two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, but maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps it's like two pairs of parallel lines intersecting each other. For example, two horizontal lines and two vertical lines, creating a grid. But with four rays, maybe they are arranged in such a way that two are one set of parallels and another two are another set. 

But the problem says "four rays intersect and form 16 angles." Wait, normally when two lines cross, they make 4 angles. If there are more lines, each new line adds more angles. But 16 angles suggests that there are multiple intersections. Maybe the four rays are arranged such that each pair intersects, leading to multiple points of intersection. However, with four rays, each pair would intersect once unless they are parallel. But since some lines are parallel, maybe some intersections don't happen.

Alternatively, considering the given lines: Line(1,5), Line(3,7), Line(9,13), Line(11,15). These seem like connecting points. Also, the angles given are Angle(3)=110 and Angle(12)=55. Let me think about how these angles relate.

Since there are parallel lines, maybe we have transversals cutting them. When a transversal crosses parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. That could be helpful here.

Let me list out the given information again:

Lines:

- Line(1,2) is parallel to Line(3,4), Line(5,6)
- Line(9,10) is parallel to Line(11,12), Line(13,14)

Also, the lines connecting points:

- Line(1,5)
- Line(3,7)
- Line(9,13)
- Line(11,15)

So, maybe these lines are transversals cutting the parallel lines. Let's consider that.

For instance, Line(1,5) connects Point 1 to Point 5. Since Line(1,2) is parallel to Line(3,4), Line(5,6), maybe Line(1,5) is a transversal cutting through these parallel lines?

Similarly, Line(3,7) connects Point 3 to Point 7. Point 3 is on Line(3,4), which is parallel to others. So perhaps these lines are transversals.

Now, angles are formed where these lines intersect. The angles given are Angle(3) = 110°, Angle(12) = 55°. Need to find Angle(1).

Let me try to map out the angles. Each intersection creates several angles. For example, when two lines cross, they create vertical angles and adjacent angles. Also, if there are parallel lines cut by a transversal, certain angles are equal or supplementary.

Given that Line(1,2) || Line(3,4) || Line(5,6), so those three lines are all parallel. Then, if Line(1,5) is a transversal cutting through them, then the angles formed would have relations. Similarly for Line(3,7), Line(9,13), etc.

But perhaps focusing on specific angles. Let's note that Angle(3) is 110°, which is probably an angle formed by the intersection of two lines, possibly involving one of the transversals and a parallel line.

Also, Angle(12) is 55°, which may be related via supplementary or corresponding angles.

Let me think step by step.

First, since Line(1,2) is parallel to Line(3,4), and Line(3,7) is a transversal. Suppose Line(3,7) intersects Line(3,4) at point 3, and Line(1,2) somewhere else. Wait, but Line(3,7) starts at Point 3, which is on Line(3,4). So Line(3,7) is starting at Point 3 and going towards Point 7. If Line(1,2) is parallel to Line(3,4), then Line(3,7) is a transversal cutting through Line(3,4) and maybe Line(1,2)?

Wait, maybe the lines Line(1,5), Line(3,7), Line(9,13), Line(11,15) are transversals cutting the parallel lines.

For example, Line(1,5): Point 1 is on Line(1,2), and Point 5 is on Line(5,6). Since Line(1,2) is parallel to Line(5,6), Line(1,5) is a transversal connecting two parallel lines. Similarly, Line(3,7) connects Point 3 (on Line(3,4)) to Point 7 (which is on Line(7,8)). Wait, but Line(7,8) is another parallel line? Or is there another set of parallel lines?

Looking at the parallel lines listed:

- Line(1,2) || Line(3,4) || Line(5,6)
- Line(9,10) || Line(11,12) || Line(13,14)

So there are two separate sets of three parallel lines each. Therefore, the four rays mentioned earlier (maybe the lines connecting Points 1-5, 3-7, 9-13, 11-15) are transversals cutting across these parallel lines.

So, for example, Line(1,5) cuts through Line(1,2) and Line(5,6), which are parallel. Similarly, Line(3,7) cuts through Line(3,4) and maybe another line? Wait, Line(3,7) goes from Point 3 (on Line(3,4)) to Point 7 (on Line(7,8)). Wait, Line(7,8) is parallel to Line(1,2) and Line(3,4) and Line(5,6)? No, because the second set of parallel lines are Line(9,10), Line(11,12), Line(13,14). So Line(7,8) isn't necessarily parallel to the first set. Unless there's more info.

Wait, the given parallel lines are:

Parallel(Line(1,2),Line(3,4)), Parallel(Line(1,2),Line(5,6)), Parallel(Line(3,4),Line(5,6)) — so all three lines (1-2, 3-4, 5-6) are parallel.

Then, Parallel(Line(9,10),Line(11,12)), Parallel(Line(9,10),Line(13,14)), Parallel(Line(11,12),Line(13,14)) — so lines 9-10, 11-12, 13-14 are all parallel.

Therefore, the lines connecting Points 1-5, 3-7, 9-13, 11-15 are transversals crossing these parallel lines.

Now, each of these transversals would form angles with the parallel lines. Given that, let's focus on the angles given: Angle(3) = 110°, Angle(12) = 55°, and need to find Angle(1).

Assuming that the numbering of angles corresponds to their position relative to the intersections. For example, when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the angles formed can be labeled sequentially. Let me try to reconstruct.

Take Line(3,7) which connects Point 3 (on Line(3,4)) to Point 7 (on Line(7,8)). Wait, but Line(7,8) is part of the first set of parallel lines? Or is it part of another set? Wait, the lines mentioned are Line(1,2), Line(3,4), Line(5,6) being parallel; and Line(9,10), Line(11,12), Line(13,14) being parallel. So Line(7,8) isn't necessarily parallel to anything else unless specified. Wait, the original predicates mention PointLiesOnLine(Point(7),Line(7,8)) and Point(8) lies on Line(7,8). But there's no statement about Line(7,8) being parallel to others. So Line(7,8) is just another line, not necessarily parallel to any.

Hmm, but maybe there's more structure. For example, if Line(1,5) connects Point 1 (on Line(1,2)) to Point 5 (on Line(5,6)), which are parallel. So that line is a transversal between two parallel lines. Similarly, Line(3,7) connects Point 3 (on Line(3,4)) to Point 7 (on Line(7,8)), which might be another transversal. But without knowing if Line(7,8) is parallel to others, it's hard to say. However, the problem mentions that two upright rays are parallel. Wait, the problem states "two upright rays are parallel"—probably referring to the lines that are parallel, which are the ones in the first set (1-2, 3-4, 5-6) and the second set (9-10, 11-12, 13-14). So the four rays (the lines?) that form the figure are the ones that are connected by the transversals? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the four rays are the ones that are parallel in pairs. But the problem says "two upright rays are parallel". Maybe the lines that are in the first set (parallel) and the second set (parallel). So two groups of parallel lines, each group having three lines. Hence, four rays total?

This is getting complicated. Let me focus on the angles given. Angle(3) is 110°, and Angle(12) is 55°. Need to find Angle(1).

Assuming that these angles are formed by the intersections of the transversals with the parallel lines. For example, Angle(3) could be an angle formed by Line(3,4) and Line(3,7), since Point 3 is on Line(3,4). Let me think about that.

Suppose Line(3,4) is one of the parallel lines (since Line(3,4) is parallel to Line(1,2) and Line(5,6)). Then Line(3,7) is a transversal starting at Point 3. So when Line(3,7) intersects Line(3,4), it forms an angle. Let's assume that Angle(3) is one of the angles created at that intersection. If Angle(3) is 110°, then its vertical angle would also be 110°, and adjacent angles would be supplementary (so 70°).

Now, if there's another transversal, say Line(1,5), which connects Point 1 (on Line(1,2)) to Point 5 (on Line(5,6)). Since Line(1,2) and Line(5,6) are parallel, this transversal would create angles that correspond to each other. If there's a relationship between these angles and Angle(3), maybe through alternate interior angles or something.

Additionally, Angle(12) is 55°. Let's see where that could be. Maybe Angle(12) is formed by another transversal and a parallel line. For example, if Line(11,12) is parallel to Line(9,10) and Line(13,14), and a transversal cuts through them, creating angles. If Angle(12) is one of those angles, then maybe it relates to other angles through the same transversal.

But how do these angles connect? Let's think step by step.

Starting with Angle(3) = 110°. This is likely an angle formed by the intersection of Line(3,4) and Line(3,7). Since Line(3,4) is parallel to Line(1,2), and Line(3,7) is a transversal. So, if we look at Line(3,7) intersecting Line(3,4) and Line(1,2), which are parallel, then the angles formed would have relationships. However, since Line(3,7) starts at Point 3 on Line(3,4), maybe it only intersects Line(3,4) and then extends to another line. Wait, but the endpoint is Point 7, which is on Line(7,8). Without knowing if Line(7,8) is parallel to anything, it's unclear. 

Alternatively, perhaps the angles are numbered based on their positions. For example, when two lines intersect, the angles around the intersection are labeled sequentially. So, if we have two transversals crossing two parallel lines, each intersection would have four angles, labeled accordingly. 

Another approach: since Angle(3) is 110°, and Angle(12) is 55°, which is half of 110°, maybe there's a relationship where one angle is twice another, or supplementary. For example, if two lines intersect, and one angle is 110°, then the opposite angle is 110°, and the adjacent angles are 70°. If there's another angle formed by a transversal with another line, maybe involving supplementary or complementary angles.

Let me think of the case where a transversal crosses two parallel lines. Then, the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So, if one angle is 110°, then the angle next to it on the same side would be 70°. If another angle is 55°, which is half of 110°, maybe it's an alternate interior angle or something else.

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved. For example, if the lines form a triangle, then the sum of angles would be 180°. But with multiple intersections, it's tricky.

Wait, let's try to consider specific examples. Let's take Line(3,4) and Line(3,7). At their intersection (Point 3), Angle(3) is formed. Since Line(3,4) is parallel to Line(1,2), and Line(3,7) is a transversal, then the angle at Point 3 (Angle(3)) could be related to angles formed by Line(3,7) with Line(1,2). 

If we suppose that Line(3,7) intersects Line(1,2) at some point, then the angles formed would be corresponding or alternate. However, without knowing where Line(3,7) intersects Line(1,2), it's hard to tell. But maybe there's another transversal, like Line(1,5), which connects to Line(5,6), which is parallel to Line(1,2). So, Line(1,5) is a transversal between Line(1,2) and Line(5,6). 

At the intersection of Line(1,5) with Line(1,2), there would be angles, and similarly at the intersection with Line(5,6). Now, if Angle(3) is formed at Point 3 (intersection of Line(3,4) and Line(3,7)), and Angle(12) is formed elsewhere, perhaps by another transversal.

Alternatively, maybe the angles are related through vertical angles or linear pairs. Let me try to draw a rough diagram mentally.

Imagine two sets of parallel lines:

Set A: Line(1,2), Line(3,4), Line(5,6) – all parallel.

Set B: Line(9,10), Line(11,12), Line(13,14) – all parallel.

Now, the lines connecting Points:

- Line(1,5): Connects Point 1 (on Set A) to Point 5 (on Set A).
- Line(3,7): Connects Point 3 (on Set A) to Point 7 (unknown).
- Line(9,13): Connects Point 9 (on Set B) to Point 13 (on Set B).
- Line(11,15): Connects Point 11 (on Set B) to Point 15 (unknown).

But without knowing where Points 7, 13, 15 are located, it's challenging. However, the angles given are Angle(3)=110 and Angle(12)=55. Perhaps Angle(3) is formed by Line(3,4) and Line(3,7), while Angle(12) is formed by Line(11,12) and another line.

Alternatively, since Angle(3) is 110°, and assuming that it's an exterior angle formed by a transversal with parallel lines, then the corresponding angle on the other parallel line would be equal. For example, if Line(3,7) is a transversal cutting Line(3,4) and Line(1,2), then the angle at Line(3,4) would correspond to an angle at Line(1,2). But since Line(1,2) is parallel to Line(3,4), those corresponding angles are equal. 

Wait, but if Angle(3) is 110°, then maybe it's a corresponding angle with another angle elsewhere. If there's another angle formed by the same transversal and another parallel line, it would also be 110°. However, Angle(12) is 55°, which is half of 110°, suggesting that it might be an angle that's supplementary or bisected.

Alternatively, think about the fact that 110° + 55° = 165°, which doesn't immediately ring a bell. Or 180° - 110° = 70°, which could be a supplementary angle. If Angle(12) is 55°, maybe it's part of a triangle or another configuration.

Wait, here's an idea: if there's a transversal cutting two parallel lines, and one of the angles is 110°, then the adjacent angle would be 70°, and if another transversal creates an angle that is half of that, like 55°, maybe due to some bisector or other construction. 

Alternatively, maybe the angles are part of a triangle. For example, if two lines intersect, creating angles that add up to 180°, and if one angle is 110°, then the adjacent angle is 70°, and if another angle is 55°, it might be part of a different triangle.

Wait, but the problem involves four rays intersecting, forming 16 angles. So there might be multiple intersections. Let me think of a scenario where two sets of parallel lines are crossed by two transversals, creating various angles.

Assume that Line(1,5) and Line(3,7) are two transversals crossing the first set of parallel lines (Set A), and Line(9,13) and Line(11,15) are transversals crossing the second set of parallel lines (Set B). 

At the intersection of Line(1,5) with Set A, there would be angles. Similarly for Line(3,7) with Set A. 

If Angle(3) is formed at the intersection of Line(3,7) with Set A, then maybe it's an angle between Line(3,7) and Line(3,4). Let's say that Angle(3) is 110°, which would mean that the corresponding angle on the other parallel line (Line(1,2)) is also 110°, making the adjacent angle 70°. 

Then, if there's another transversal, say Line(1,5), crossing Set A, and forming angles that could be related to Angle(12) = 55°. 

Alternatively, maybe Angle(12) is formed by the intersection of Line(11,12) and another transversal. Since Line(11,12) is part of Set B, which has its own parallel lines, and Line(11,15) is a transversal crossing it. 

But I'm struggling to see the direct connection between Angle(3) and Angle(12). Let's try to think of the possible relationships. 

Since Angle(3) is 110°, and Angle(12) is 55°, which is exactly half of 110°, maybe there's a bisecting line or some proportional relationship. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that when two lines intersect, the sum of adjacent angles is 180°, and vertical angles are equal. So, if Angle(3) is 110°, then the angle opposite to it is also 110°, and the two adjacent angles are each 70°. 

Now, if Angle(12) is 55°, maybe it's one of those adjacent angles, but that seems inconsistent with 55° being 70° minus 15°, but that doesn't directly help. 

Wait, perhaps Angle(12) is an alternate interior angle with respect to another transversal. For example, if there's a transversal that forms an angle with a parallel line, and that angle is 55°, which could be related to Angle(3) through some property. 

Another thought: since there are two sets of parallel lines, the angles formed could be part of a parallelogram or other figure. For instance, if two transversals cut two parallel lines, forming a parallelogram, then opposite angles are equal, and consecutive angles are supplementary. 

But I need to tie this to the given angles. Let me consider that Angle(3) is 110°, and Angle(12) is 55°, which is half of 110°. Maybe Angle(12) is an angle formed by a transversal that splits Angle(3) in some way. 

Alternatively, consider that Angle(3) is an exterior angle of a triangle, and Angle(12) is an remote interior angle. For example, if there's a triangle where Angle(3) is the exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the two remote interior angles. But if one of them is 55°, then the other would be 55°, making the exterior angle 110°, which fits. 

But how does this fit into the overall diagram? If Angle(3) is an exterior angle, then it would be formed by extending a side of the triangle. However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let's think about the possibility that Angle(3) and Angle(12) are related through some transversal. For example, if Line(3,7) and Line(11,15) are transversals cutting different sets of parallel lines, and their angles are related through some proportionality. 

Alternatively, since Angle(3) is 110°, and Angle(12) is 55°, which is half, maybe there's a bisector involved. If a line bisects an angle of 110°, it creates two angles of 55°, which matches Angle(12). But where would that bisector be? 

Perhaps Angle(3) is split into two angles by another line, creating a 55° angle. But I need to link this to the rest of the diagram. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle formed by the intersection of the transversals and the parallel lines, where Angle(3) is an external angle and Angle(12) is an internal angle. For example, if we have a triangle with one angle being 110°, and another angle being 55°, then the third angle would be 180 - 110 - 55 = 15°, but that doesn't directly help. 

Wait, but maybe the lines form a series of triangles or other polygons. Another approach: use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°, and around intersections, angles add up to 180°. 

Let me try to think of specific intersections. Let's take the intersection of Line(3,7) with Line(3,4) (at Point 3), forming Angle(3)=110°. Then, the vertically opposite angle would also be 110°, and the adjacent angles would be 70° each. Now, if Line(3,7) continues and intersects another line, say Line(1,2), which is parallel to Line(3,4), then the angle formed at that intersection would be corresponding to the 110° angle, hence also 110°, or supplementary. 

Wait, if Line(3,7) intersects Line(1,2), then the angle formed would depend on the direction of the line. If the line is extended beyond Point 3, it might form an angle with Line(1,2). 

But without knowing the exact orientation, it's challenging. However, if Angle(12) is 55°, maybe it's an angle formed by another transversal. For example, if Line(11,15) intersects Line(11,12) (part of Set B), creating an angle of 55°. 

Now, if Angle(12) is 55°, and if there's a relationship between Angles(3) and (12) through parallel lines, perhaps through corresponding or alternate angles. 

Wait, here's an idea: since Line(1,2) is parallel to Line(3,4), and Line(3,7) is a transversal, the angle at Point 3 (Angle(3)) is equal to the corresponding angle on Line(1,2). If that corresponding angle is 110°, then the adjacent angle on Line(1,2) would be 70°. Now, if there's another transversal, like Line(1,5), which intersects Line(1,2) and Line(5,6), creating angles. If one of those angles is related to Angle(12)=55°, maybe through some property.

Alternatively, since Angle(12) is 55°, and if it's an alternate interior angle with respect to another transversal and parallel lines, then it would be equal to another angle. 

But I'm still not seeing the direct link. Let me try to consider that Angle(1) is one of the angles formed by the intersection of Line(1,5) with Line(1,2). Since Line(1,5) is a transversal between two parallel lines (Line(1,2) and Line(5,6)), the angles formed would have relationships. 

If Angle(1) is one of those angles, and if it's related to Angle(3) or Angle(12), then we can derive it. 

For example, if Line(1,5) is a transversal between Line(1,2) and Line(5,6), then the angles on the same side would be supplementary. If Angle(3) is 110°, and it's on one side, maybe the angle on the other side would be 70°, and if Angle(12) is 55°, perhaps it's an alternate interior angle to another angle. 

But how to connect this to Angle(1)? 

Maybe Angle(1) is a corresponding angle to Angle(12), or something like that. 

Alternatively, since Angle(3) is 110°, and if there's a straight line, then the supplementary angle would be 70°, and if Angle(12) is 55°, maybe it's part of a triangle where these angles combine. 

Wait, here's a possible path: Assume that Angle(3) is an angle formed by Line(3,4) and Line(3,7), which is 110°. Because Line(3,4) is parallel to Line(1,2), the angle formed by Line(3,7) with Line(1,2) would also be 110°, making the corresponding angle on Line(1,2) also 110°. Then, the adjacent angle on Line(1,2) would be 70°. Now, if Line(1,5) is a transversal crossing Line(1,2) and Line(5,6), and if it forms an angle with Line(1,2) that is supplementary to Angle(3), then it would be 70°, but how does that relate to Angle(12)=55°?

Alternatively, if there's a triangle formed by the intersections of these lines, and Angle(3) and Angle(12) are parts of that triangle. 

Alternatively, since Angle(12) is 55°, which is half of 110°, maybe it's an angle that is half of Angle(3), implying some bisecting line. 

Wait, but without more information, it's difficult to proceed. Let me try to recall standard angle problems with parallel lines and transversals. 

When a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. 

Suppose that Angle(3) is an angle formed by a transversal with one of the parallel lines (say, Line(3,4)). If this angle is 110°, then the consecutive interior angle on the other parallel line (Line(1,2)) would be 70°, because they are supplementary. Now, if another transversal creates an angle of 55°, maybe it's an alternate interior angle to another angle, or something else. 

If Angle(12) is 55°, and it's an alternate interior angle with respect to another transversal, then it would be equal to another angle. 

But how does this relate to Angle(1)? 

Maybe Angle(1) is a corresponding angle to Angle(12), or it's supplementary to it. 

Alternatively, if Angle(1) is part of a triangle with Angle(3) and Angle(12), then we could use triangle angle sums. 

For example, if Angle(3) is 110°, and Angle(12) is 55°, and they are part of a triangle, then the third angle would be 180 - 110 - 55 = 15°, but that doesn't seem to align with the given options. 

Alternatively, if Angle(1) is an exterior angle to a triangle where the remote interior angles are 55° and something else. 

But I'm stuck. Let me try to consider the answer choices: A=55, B=110, C=125, D=135. 

If Angle(1) is 125°, which is 180 - 55, or 180 - 110 = 70, but none of those are options except for C and D. 

Wait, if Angle(3) is 110°, then the adjacent angle is 70°, which is supplementary. If there's a transversal creating an angle of 55°, which is half of 110°, maybe it's formed by splitting the 70° angle into 55° and 15°, but that doesn't seem straightforward. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles 55°, 55°, and 70°, but again, not sure. 

Another idea: since there are two sets of parallel lines, and the angles formed by the transversals, maybe the angles are related through some proportional relationships. 

For example, if Angle(3) is 110°, and it's formed by a transversal with one set of parallel lines, and Angle(12) is formed by another transversal with the other set of parallel lines. If those transversals are parallel to each other, then their angles would be equal. But since Angle(3) is 110° and Angle(12) is 55°, they aren't equal, so that might not hold. 

Wait, but maybe Angle(12) is an alternate interior angle with respect to another transversal and the other set of parallel lines. For example, if Line(11,15) is a transversal cutting Line(11,12) and Line(13,14), which are parallel. If Angle(12) is 55°, then the corresponding angle on the other parallel line would also be 55°. 

If there's a relationship between these angles and Angle(3), perhaps through a triangle or supplementary angles. 

Alternatively, since 110° + 55° = 165°, and if there's a straight line, then 180° - 165° = 15°, but again, not sure. 

Let me try to think about the answer choices. If Angle(1) is 125°, that would be 180 - 55, which is supplementary. If Angle(1) is 125°, and it's supplementary to 55°, then maybe it's part of a straight line. 

But how to justify that? 

Alternatively, if Angle(1) is formed by a transversal that creates a supplementary angle with Angle(3). For example, if Angle(1) and Angle(3) are on a straight line, then they would add up to 180°, so Angle(1) = 180 - 110 = 70°, but 70° isn't among the choices. 

Wait, but if Angle(1) is formed by a transversal and a parallel line, and it's an alternate exterior angle to Angle(3), then it would be equal to Angle(3), so 110°, which is option B. But why would that be the case? 

Alternatively, if Angle(1) is a corresponding angle to Angle(12), which is 55°, then it would be 55°, option A. 

But how to know which one it is? 

Maybe I need to consider that Angle(1) is formed by the intersection of Line(1,5) with Line(1,2). Since Line(1,5) is a transversal between Line(1,2) and Line(5,6), which are parallel. If Angle(1) is one of the angles formed at the intersection with Line(1,2), then it depends on the orientation. 

If Angle(3) is 110°, and it's an angle formed by Line(3,7) with Line(3,4), which is parallel to Line(1,2), then the corresponding angle with Line(1,2) would also be 110°. If Line(1,5) is another transversal, then it would create angles with Line(1,2). If Angle(1) is one of those angles, it could be either 110° or 70°, depending on which angle it is. 

But Angle(12) is 55°, which might be related to another transversal. For example, if Line(11,15) is a transversal cutting through Line(11,12) and Line(13,14), which are parallel. If Angle(12) is an alternate interior angle to another angle, then it would be equal to that angle. 

If Angle(12) is 55°, then the corresponding angle on the other parallel line would also be 55°. If this angle is part of a triangle or some other relation, it could help determine Angle(1). 

But I'm still not making progress. Let me try to consider the possibility that Angle(1) is 125°, which is 180 - 55. If Angle(12) is 55°, then Angle(1) could be supplementary to it. 

Alternatively, since Angle(3) is 110°, and Angle(12) is 55°, which is half of 110°, maybe there's a relationship where Angle(1) is supplementary to 55°, giving 125°. 

That would make Angle(1) = 180 - 55 = 125°, which is option C. 

This seems plausible. Let me check: if there's a straight line with Angle(12) = 55°, then the supplementary angle would be 125°. So if Angle(1) is that supplementary angle, then it's 125°. 

But why would Angle(1) be supplementary to Angle(12)? It would depend on their positions. If they are on a straight line, then yes. 

Alternatively, if Angle(1) is an exterior angle to a triangle where Angle(12) is an interior angle. For example, if Angle(1) is an exterior angle, then it equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. If one of those interior angles is 55°, then the other would be something. But without more info, it's speculative. 

However, given the answer choices and the reasoning, 125° (option C) is a common supplement to 55°, and it's a typical angle found in parallel line problems. 

Thus, I'll go with Option C: 125°.
