====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the formula for h(x) which is a cosine function of the form h(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d. The graph has a maximum point at (-2π, 3) and a minimum point at (-π/2, -4). 

First, I remember that the general form of a cosine function is y = a cos(bx + c) + d. Here, 'a' affects the amplitude, 'b' relates to the period, 'c' is the horizontal shift, and 'd' is the vertical shift. 

Since there are maximum and minimum points given, I should start by finding the vertical shift 'd'. The vertical shift is the average of the maximum and minimum values. Let me calculate that. The maximum y-value is 3 and the minimum is -4. Adding them together gives 3 + (-4) = -1. Dividing by 2, so d = -1 / 2? Wait, no. Wait, the vertical shift is the midpoint between the max and min. So it's (max + min)/2. So (3 + (-4))/2 = (-1)/2 = -0.5. So d = -0.5? Wait, but looking back at the MeasureOf predicates, there's something about Point(A) having measure -6.283 and 3, and Point(B) with -1.571 and -4. Hmm, maybe those measures relate to the coordinates?

Wait, the problem says that the function has a maximum at (-2π, 3) and a minimum at (-π/2, -4). So these points are on the graph. But how do they relate to the parameters of the cosine function?

Let me recall that for a standard cosine function y = a cos(bx) + d, the midline is y = d, which is the vertical shift. The amplitude is |a|, so the maximum value is d + |a| and the minimum is d - |a|. 

Given that the maximum is 3 and the minimum is -4, so setting up equations:

d + a = 3  
d - a = -4  

Adding these two equations: 2d = -1 → d = -0.5. Then substituting back, if d is -0.5, then:

From first equation: -0.5 + a = 3 → a = 3.5. Similarly, second equation: -0.5 - a = -4 → a = 3.5. So yes, a = 3.5. So that's the amplitude. 

So far, we have h(x) = 3.5 cos(bx + c) - 0.5. Now, next step is to find b and c. 

To find b, we need the period of the function. The distance between two consecutive maximum and minimum points would give us half the period. Wait, the maximum occurs at x = -2π and the minimum at x = -π/2. The difference between these x-values is (-π/2) - (-2π) = (-π/2 + 2π) = (3π/2). This interval corresponds to half the period because from a maximum to the next minimum is half a period. Therefore, the full period T is twice this, so T = 2*(3π/2) = 3π. 

But wait, the period of a cosine function is 2π / |b|. So T = 2π / b = 3π → solving for b: b = 2π / T = 2π / 3π = 2/3. Wait, but hold on. Wait, the time between maximum and minimum is half the period. So if the period is T, then half-period is T/2. So the difference between x-coordinates of max and min is T/2. Therefore, T/2 = 3π/2 → T = 3π. Hence, period T = 3π. Thus, b = 2π / T = 2π / (3π) )= 2/3. So b = 2/3. 

Now, we need to find the phase shift c. For the standard cosine function, the phase shift is determined by the horizontal shift. Since the maximum occurs at x = -2π, but normally the maximum of cos(bx) is at x = 0. However, our function is shifted horizontally. Let me think. 

The general form is h(x) = a cos(b(x + φ)) + d, where φ is the phase shift. Alternatively, written as h(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d, where c = bφ. 

We know that the maximum occurs when bx + c = 0 (since cos(θ) is maximum at θ = 0). So for the maximum at x = -2π, plugging into the argument: b*(-2π) + c = 0. So c = 2π*b. 

Alternatively, since we have found b = 2/3, then c = 2π*(2/3) ? Wait, no. Wait, let me re-express. 

At the maximum point x = -2π, the argument inside the cosine should be zero. So:

bx + c = 0 → (2/3)x + c = 0 at x = -2π. Plugging in x=-2π:

(2/3)*(-2π) + c = 0 → -4π/3 + c = 0 → c = 4π/3. 

Therefore, the function becomes h(x) = 3.5 cos((2/3)x + 4π/3) - 0.5. 

Wait, but let me check if that works. Let's test the minimum point. At x = -π/2, the function should reach its minimum. Let's compute the argument:

(2/3)*(-π/2) + 4π/3 = (-π/3) + 4π/3 = 3π/3 = π. Cosine of π is -1, so the value is 3.5*(-1) + (-0.5) = -3.5 -0.5 = -4, which matches the minimum. And at x=-2π, the argument is (2/3)(-2π) + 4π/3 = -4π/3 + 4π/3 = 0, cos(0)=1, so 3.5*1 -0.5 = 3.0, which matches the maximum. So that seems correct. 

But let me confirm the phase shift again. Another way to think is that the maximum occurs at x=-2π. Normally, without phase shift, the maximum is at x=0. So shifting left by 2π would make the maximum at x=-2π. But the function is h(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d. To get a horizontal shift of -k, we write it as cos(b(x + k)). Which expands to cos(bx + bk). So comparing, c = bk. So here, the horizontal shift is k = -2π (since the maximum is at x=-2π). Wait, the horizontal shift is such that the graph is shifted left by 2π. So the phase shift is -k, where k is the shift amount. Wait, perhaps I'm confusing signs here. 

Alternatively, the phase shift formula is -c/b. Because h(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d = a cos[b(x + c/b)] + d. So the phase shift is -c/b. So if the maximum occurs at x = -2π, then the phase shift is set such that the original maximum at x=0 is moved to x=-2π. So the phase shift is -2π. Therefore, -c/b = -2π → c/b = 2π → c = 2π*b. Since we found earlier that b = 2/3, then c = 2π*(2/3) = 4π/3. Which matches our previous calculation. 

Thus, the formula is h(x) = 3.5 cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 0.5. 

But let me check if there's another possibility. For example, sometimes there could be different forms due to periodicity. For instance, adding multiples of 2π to the phase shift. But since we're looking for the simplest form, probably 4π/3 is acceptable. 

Another thing to consider: Could the function be expressed with a negative sign inside the cosine? Like, maybe using sine instead? But the problem specifies it's a cosine function. Also, the given points are a maximum and minimum, so the function is indeed a cosine wave. 

Wait, but the problem mentions the MeasureOf predicates. Looking back, the user mentioned that Point(A) has MeasureOf(A, -6.283, 3). Wait, maybe that refers to coordinates? Or perhaps the x-coordinate and y-coordinate? Maybe the points A and B correspond to the maximum and minimum points? 

Wait, the problem states that the graph of h(x) has a maximum at (-2π, 3) and a minimum at (-π/2, -4). These points are likely Points A and B. So Point(A) is (-2π, 3) and Point(B) is (-π/2, -4). The MeasureOf(A, -6.283, 3): Wait, -6.283 is approximately -2π, since π ≈ 3.1416, so 2π ≈ 6.283. So -6.283 is roughly -2π. So the x-coordinate of Point A is -2π, and the y-coordinate is 3. Similarly, Point(B)'s x-coordinate is -π/2 ≈ -1.571 (since π/2 ≈ 1.5708), and y-coordinate is -4. 

So the given MeasureOf predicates are just confirming the coordinates of points A and B, which are the maximum and minimum points. 

So our earlier calculations are consistent with these points. 

Putting it all together, the formula for h(x) is h(x) = 3.5 cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 0.5. 

But the problem asks for an exact expression. Let me express the numbers as fractions. 

3.5 is 7/2. So, a = 7/2. 

Then, b is 2/3. 

The phase shift term is 4π/3. 

So the exact expression is h(x) = (7/2) cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 1/2. 

Alternatively, combining constants, but I don't think there's a simpler way. 

Therefore, the answer should be h(x) = (7/2) cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 1/2. 

But the problem says to provide the formula, and the answer choices were not given. However, according to the instructions, the user said there are no answer choices, but the assistant needs to select one of A-D. Wait, but the original problem didn't list options, and the user says "Answer Choices: No choices found." So the user wants the answer to be selected from A-D, but since there are no choices, maybe the actual intended answer is one of them, but since we can't see the choices, we have to assume that the correct answer is derived as above. 

But the system requires the Final Answer to be one of A-D. However, since there are no choices provided, perhaps the user made a mistake. But following the instructions strictly, even though there are no answer choices, I need to pick one. Wait, the initial problem statement says "Below is the graph of h(x)" but the user hasn't provided options. However, the user's instruction says "Give an exact expression" and then "select the correct answer choice", implying that there are options. However, in the problem description, the user wrote "Answer Choices: No choices found." So perhaps there was an error in pasting the problem. 

But regardless, since I have to choose between A-D, and assuming that the correct answer is among them, but since I cannot see the options, perhaps the answer is supposed to be in terms of the given points. However, given the process, the answer is h(x) = (7/2) cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 1/2. 

But since the user might expect the answer in a particular format, like using fractions instead of decimals. For example, 3.5 is 7/2, and 4π/3 is already exact. 

Thus, the exact formula is h(x) = (7/2) cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 1/2. 

Assuming that this is one of the answer choices, say option A, then the answer is A. But since there are no options, I can't be sure. However, following the strict instructions, I have to output one of A-D. Given that, and considering that the problem may have had options with this exact expression, I'll proceed to choose the corresponding letter. 

But since there's no way to know, but the user's last message says "No choices found," but the instructions require selecting one. Perhaps the original problem had options, but they weren't included. In that case, I'll proceed under the assumption that my derived formula is correct and select the corresponding choice, which would be A, B, C, or D. However, since I can't verify, I'll have to go with the derived formula. But the system requires a single letter. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer expects different forms. Let me check once more. 

Alternatively, maybe the phase shift can be simplified differently. For example, 4π/3 can be represented as -2π/3 + 2π, but since cosine is periodic, adding 2π doesn't change the value. However, the standard form usually prefers the phase shift within a certain range. 

Alternatively, writing the function as h(x) = (7/2) cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 1/2. 

But perhaps the answer is expected to use a negative coefficient inside the cosine. For example, factoring out the negative sign: 

h(x) = (7/2) cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 1/2. 

Alternatively, using the identity cos(θ + π) = -cos(θ), but that might complicate things. 

Alternatively, maybe the phase shift can be adjusted. Let me check the calculation again. 

Earlier, we found that c = 4π/3. But maybe there's another way. Suppose we want to write the function as h(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d. We have the maximum at x=-2π. The general maximum occurs when bx + c = 2πk for integer k. Let's take k=0, so bx + c = 0 → c = -bx. At x=-2π, c = -b*(-2π) = 2bπ. 

But earlier, we found that b = 2/3. So c = 2*(2/3)*π = 4π/3. So same result. 

Hence, the formula is correct. 

Thus, the answer is h(x) = (7/2) cos( (2/3)x + 4π/3 ) - 1/2. 

Assuming that this is option A, then the answer is A. But since I don't know the options, I have to guess. However, the user's instruction says to select one of A-D. Without knowing the options, but given that the problem requires an exact expression, and assuming that the options are labeled accordingly, I'll proceed to state the answer as Final Answer: A, assuming that it's the correct option.
