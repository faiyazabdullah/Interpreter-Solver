MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, and C. There are several angles labeled 1 through 8, and some measures assigned to them. Also, there are triangles involving these points, and some perpendicularity conditions. The main question is to find the measure of angle 2, given that AB is perpendicular to BC. 

Let me break down the predicates one by one. 

First, Point(A), Point(B), Point(C) – so we have three distinct points. Then there are angles mentioned: Angle(1) to Angle(8). Some of their measures are given. For example, MeasureOf(Angle(3),104), MeasureOf(Angle(1),X), MeasureOf(Angle(2),36), MeasureOf(Angle(5),90), MeasureOf(Angle(7),Y), MeasureOf(Angle(8),40). Wait, but X and Y here are variables? Or are they points? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y). So X and Y are points forming triangles with A,B and B,C respectively. So maybe X and Y are points where those triangles are formed. 

Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)) – so AB is perpendicular to BC. That means angle at point B between AB and BC is 90 degrees. But wait, the problem says AB ⊥ BC, so angle ABC is a right angle. However, there's also a RightAngle(Angle(5)), which might refer to that same angle since it's a right angle. Let me check the MeasureOf(Angle(5),90). So Angle(5) is 90 degrees. So probably Angle(5) corresponds to the right angle at B.

Then there are some other triangles: Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y). So point X is part of triangle ABX, and Y is part of triangle BCY. Also, PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(X,B,C)) – so point A lies on the line connecting X, B, and C. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(C,Line(X,B,C)) – so point C is also on that line. Therefore, line XB C passes through points X, B, C, with A lying on it. Wait, but X is a point such that Triangle(A,B,X) exists. So maybe X is another point connected to A and B, but since A lies on line XB C, perhaps X is colinear with B and C? Wait, but the line is Line(X,B,C). So the line goes through X, B, and C. So points X, B, C are colinear. And point A lies on that same line. So A, X, B, C are all on the same straight line? Wait, but Triangle(A,B,X) implies that A, B, X form a triangle. If they are colinear, then that would mean they are not a triangle. So there must be something wrong here. Wait, maybe the line is Line(X,B,C), meaning that X is a different point. Wait, perhaps the line is defined by points X, B, and C. So X is a separate point from B and C. But then A lies on that line. So A is on line XB C. So points X, B, C are colinear, and A is on that line as well. But then Triangle(A,B,X) would require that A, B, X are not colinear. But if A is on the line XB C, which includes X, B, and C, then A could be anywhere on that line. But if A is on that line, then points A, B, X are colinear? Unless X is not between A and B. Hmm, this seems conflicting. Maybe I need to think more carefully.

Wait, the line is called Line(X,B,C). So the line is determined by points X, B, and C. Since three points define a line, but if X is not colinear with B and C, then the line is unique. However, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(X,B,C)), so point A lies on that line. Therefore, A is on the line passing through X, B, and C. So points A, B, C, X are all on the same line? Wait, but then Triangle(A,B,X) would be degenerate because all points are colinear. That contradicts the existence of the triangle. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps Line(X,B,C) refers to the line passing through points X and B and C. So X is a point such that the line through X and B and C exists. But then if A is on that line, then A is colinear with X, B, and C. Which again would make Triangle(A,B,X) impossible unless X is not on that line. This suggests that my initial understanding might be incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the line is Line(X,B), and then C lies on it? Wait, the original predicate is PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(X,B,C)). So the line is Line(X,B,C), meaning the line is defined by points X, B, and C. So if X, B, C are colinear, then the line is just that line. So A lies on that line. Therefore, A is on the line containing X, B, and C. So A, X, B, and C are all on the same line. But then Triangle(A,B,X) would require that A, B, X are not colinear. Which they aren't if X is not between A and B. Wait, but if A is on the line through X, B, C, then depending on where X is located relative to A, B, and C, the triangle could exist. For example, suppose X is a point such that the line passes through X, B, and C, and A is another point on that line. Then Triangle(A,B,X) would be degenerate if A, B, X are colinear. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my interpretation. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line is Line(X,B) and C lies on it? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(C,Line(X,B,C)). So Line(X,B,C) is the line passing through X, B, and C. Therefore, C is on that line. So the line contains points X, B, C. And A is also on that line. Hence, all four points A, X, B, C are colinear. Thus, Triangle(A,B,X) would require that A, B, X are not colinear, but they are. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding. 

Wait, maybe the line is Line(X,B) and Line(B,C)? No, the predicate says Line(X,B,C), which is the line through X, B, and C. So if X is not between A and B, but A is on that line, then perhaps X is a different point. For instance, if A is on the line extending beyond X from B and C. For example, imagine points arranged as X---B---C---A. Then A is on the line through X, B, C. In this case, Triangle(A,B,X) would have vertices at A, B, X, which are not colinear. Because A is on the line, but X is between B and C, while A is beyond C. So in that scenario, Triangle(A,B,X) would be valid. Similarly, Triangle(B,C,Y) would involve Y being another point. 

But the problem states that AB is perpendicular to BC. Given that AB is perpendicular to BC, the angle at B between AB and BC is 90 degrees. So angle ABC is 90 degrees, which is measured as Angle(5) since MeasureOf(Angle(5),90). So that aligns with RightAngle(Angle(5)). 

Now, considering the triangles: Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y). So in Triangle(A,B,X), the sides are AB, BX, and AX. Similarly, Triangle(B,C,Y) has sides BC, BY, and CY. 

Given that AB is perpendicular to BC, so AB ⊥ BC. Therefore, angle at B (ABC) is 90 degrees. Now, looking at the other angles given: MeasureOf(Angle(1),X), MeasureOf(Angle(2),36), MeasureOf(Angle(5),90), MeasureOf(Angle(7),Y), MeasureOf(Angle(8),40). Wait, but X and Y here are variables? Or are they points? Wait, earlier, Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y). So X and Y are points. So MeasureOf(Angle(1),X) would imply that Angle(1) has measure X. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(7),Y) means Angle(7) has measure Y. But in the problem, the user wants us to find the measure of angle 2, which is given as 36? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "Find the measure of ∠2 if AB⊥BC." But according to the given predicates, MeasureOf(Angle(2),36). Wait, that seems like angle 2 is already given as 36. But that can't be, because the question is asking to find it. So perhaps there's confusion here. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

The user wrote:

"MeasureOf(Angle(1),X)
MeasureOf(Angle(2),36)
MeasureOf(Angle(5),90)
MeasureOf(Angle(7),Y)
MeasureOf(Angle(8),40)"

So Angle(2) is given as 36 degrees. But the question asks to find the measure of angle 2. That seems contradictory. Unless there's a misinterpretation here. Perhaps the variables X and Y are not points but variables representing angles?

Wait, maybe there was a typo in the way the predicates were written. Let me re-examine the original input. The user provided:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
Point(A)

Triangle(A,B,X)
Triangle(B,C,Y)
Add(X,104,180)
Add(Y,40,180)"

Ah! Here, MeasureOf(Angle(1),X) likely means that the measure of Angle(1) is X. Similarly, Add(X,104,180) suggests that X + 104 = 180. Similarly, Add(Y,40,180) means Y + 40 = 180. So X and Y are variables representing angles. So X is the measure of Angle(1), and Y is the measure of Angle(7).

Therefore, the measure of Angle(1) is X, which satisfies X + 104 = 180 → X = 76. Similarly, Y + 40 = 180 → Y = 140. 

But the question is about finding the measure of angle 2, which is given as 36. But that seems odd. Wait, perhaps the problem is that Angle(2) is not directly given but needs to be derived from other information? Or is there a miscalculation here?

Wait, the problem states that AB is perpendicular to BC, so angle ABC is 90 degrees, which is Angle(5) with measure 90. Then, the triangles involved are Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y). So perhaps Angle(1) and Angle(2) are angles within those triangles?

Let me try to visualize the diagram. We have points A, B, C with AB ⊥ BC. So imagine a right angle at B. Points X and Y are such that Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y) exist. Also, points A and C lie on the line through X, B, C. So A and C are on the same line as X, B, and C. 

In Triangle(A,B,X), the angles would be at A, B, and X. Similarly, in Triangle(B,C,Y), angles at B, C, and Y. 

Since AB is perpendicular to BC, angle at B in the big triangle ABC is 90 degrees. But since AB and BC are parts of the lines, maybe we can consider triangles involving those points. 

Looking at Triangle(A,B,X): Let's assume that X is a point such that line XB is extended beyond B to point C. Wait, but earlier we had that A lies on line XB C. So A is on that line. Suppose the line passes through X, then B, then C. So A could be either on one side of B or the other. Let's say A is on the extension beyond B from X. So the order is X --- B --- C --- A. Then, Triangle(A,B,X) would have vertices A, B, X. 

Similarly, Triangle(B,C,Y) would have vertices B, C, Y. 

Now, in Triangle(A,B,X), we can analyze its angles. Let's denote angle at B as angle ABX. But since AB is perpendicular to BC, and if X is along the line extending from B away from C, then angle ABX would be supplementary to angle ABC. Wait, angle ABC is 90 degrees, so if AB is perpendicular to BC, then angle between AB and BC is 90 degrees. If X is on the line extending from B in the direction opposite to C, then angle ABX would be 180 - 90 = 90 degrees? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe angle at B in Triangle(A,B,X) is part of the larger structure.

Alternatively, maybe angle(1) and angle(2) are angles in these triangles. Let's look at the given measures:

MeasureOf(Angle(3),104) → Angle(3) is 104 degrees.

MeasureOf(Angle(1),X) → Angle(1) is X degrees, which we found earlier to be 76 degrees (since X + 104 = 180).

MeasureOf(Angle(2),36) → Angle(2) is 36 degrees. But the question asks to find angle 2. That seems conflicting. Unless there's a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the given MeasureOf(Angle(2),36) is actually a variable substitution. For example, maybe Angle(2) is supposed to be derived from other angles, and the given measure of 36 is part of the setup. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe there's a mix-up between variables and actual angles. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user made a typo, and instead of MeasureOf(Angle(2),36), it should be MeasureOf(Angle(2), ?), and the answer requires calculating it. But given the current info, it's unclear. 

Wait, but the problem says "Find the measure of ∠2 if AB ⊥ BC". Given that AB ⊥ BC, and the other given angles, perhaps we can use the sum of angles in triangles and the fact that certain angles are right angles. 

Let me try to focus on the triangles and angles. 

Starting with Triangle(A,B,X). Let's call the angles in this triangle as follows: At point A, angle is α; at point B, angle is β; at point X, angle is γ. So α + β + γ = 180 degrees. 

Similarly, Triangle(B,C,Y) has angles at B, C, Y. Let's say at B it's δ, at C it's ε, and at Y it's ζ. Their sum is also 180 degrees.

Given that AB ⊥ BC, so angle ABC is 90 degrees. If point X is on the line extending from B, then depending on where X is, the angles in Triangle(A,B,X) may vary. 

But also, we have other angle measures given:

Angle(3) is 104 degrees.

Angle(1) is X, which we found to be 76 degrees (from X + 104 = 180).

Angle(5) is 90 degrees (the right angle).

Angle(7) is Y, which is 140 degrees (from Y + 40 = 180).

Angle(8) is 40 degrees.

Now, trying to connect these to the triangles. 

Assume that Angle(1) is one of the angles in Triangle(A,B,X). For example, if Angle(1) is at point A, then in Triangle(A,B,X), angle at A is 76 degrees. If angle at B is part of the right angle. But since AB is perpendicular to BC, which is part of the line BC. 

Alternatively, maybe Angle(3) is part of Triangle(B,C,Y). Let me think. 

Another approach: Since AB ⊥ BC, then triangle ABC is a right triangle at B. However, points X and Y are part of other triangles. 

But the problem involves two triangles: Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y). Let's consider each triangle separately.

For Triangle(A,B,X):

- It has points A, B, X.

- AB is one side, BX is another, and AX is the third.

Since AB is perpendicular to BC, and assuming that X is aligned such that BX is collinear with BC, then angle at B in Triangle(A,B,X) would be supplementary to angle ABC. Wait, if X is on the line BC extended beyond B, then angle between BA and BX would be 180 - angle ABC. But angle ABC is 90 degrees, so angle ABX would be 90 degrees. But then if that's the case, then in Triangle(A,B,X), angle at B is 90 degrees, making it a right triangle. 

However, if X is not on BC but somewhere else, the angles change. But given the earlier predicate that PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(X,B,C)), implying that A is on the line through X, B, and C. So if X is on the line BC extended, then A is on the same line. So the line passes through X, B, C, and A. 

Assuming that, then Triangle(A,B,X) is a degenerate triangle if A, B, X are colinear. But that's not possible, so X must be positioned such that it's not on the same line as A, B, and C. Wait, but the line is Line(X,B,C), which means X is part of the line passing through B and C. So if X is a different point on that line, then A is also on that line. Hence, A, X, B, C are colinear. Therefore, Triangle(A,B,X) would have points A, B, X on a straight line, making it degenerate. This contradiction suggests that there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the line definitions.

Perhaps the line is not Line(X,B,C), but Line(X,B) and Line(B,C)? Or maybe the line is Line(X,B) and Point C lies on it? 

This confusion indicates that I need to revisit the predicates. 

Rechecking the predicates:

- PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(X,B,C)): So point A lies on the line defined by points X, B, and C. 

- PointLiesOnLine(C,Line(X,B,C)): So point C lies on the same line. 

Thus, the line passes through X, B, C, and A. So all four points are colinear. Hence, Triangle(A,B,X) would be degenerate, which contradicts the existence of the triangle. Therefore, there must be an error in my interpretation. 

Wait, unless X is not on the line BC. Wait, the line is Line(X,B,C), which means that X, B, and C are colinear. So X is a point such that B and C are on the line through X. So if X is not on BC, but B and C are on the line through X. So X is a separate point, and the line passes through X, B, and C. Therefore, X, B, and C are colinear, and A is also on that line. So A is on the same line as X, B, and C. Hence, Triangle(A,B,X) is degenerate. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the given predicates. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made a wrong assumption. 

Alternative approach: Perhaps Line(X,B,C) is meant to be Line(X,B) and Line(B,C), i.e., two separate lines, but that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the line is Line(X,B) and Line(X,C), but that also doesn't clarify. 

Alternatively, maybe the line is Line(X,B) and Point C lies on it. So the line is Line(X,B), and C is on it. Hence, X, B, and C are colinear. And A is also on that line. So again, leading to the same issue. 

Given this contradiction, perhaps the intended configuration is different. Let me think differently. Suppose that Triangle(A,B,X) is not degenerate, which would mean that A, B, X are not colinear. But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(X,B,C)), meaning A is on the line through X, B, and C. So if X, B, C are colinear, then A is also on that line. Hence, A, X, B, C are colinear. Therefore, Triangle(A,B,X) would require that A, B, X are not colinear, but they are. 

This contradiction implies that there's a mistake in the problem setup or my interpretation. To resolve this, perhaps the line is not Line(X,B,C) but Line(X,B) and Line(B,C), but that still doesn't clarify. 

Alternatively, maybe the line is Line(X,B) and Line(X,C), but that would imply two separate lines. 

At this point, I'm stuck due to the contradictions in the predicates. Perhaps I should proceed by focusing on the given angle measures and relationships, ignoring the conflicting line definitions. 

We know that AB ⊥ BC, so angle at B is 90 degrees. Also, MeasureOf(Angle(5),90) confirms this. 

Other given angle measures:

Angle(3) is 104 degrees.

Angle(1) is X, which we calculated as 76 degrees (since X + 104 = 180).

Angle(2) is given as 36 degrees.

Angle(7) is Y, which is 140 degrees (since Y + 40 = 180).

Angle(8) is 40 degrees.

Now, the question is to find the measure of angle 2. But according to the given data, Angle(2) is 36 degrees. This suggests that perhaps the given MeasureOf(Angle(2),36) is a red herring, and the actual value needs to be computed. But why would that be the case?

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for angle 2 in terms of other angles. Let me think about the triangles. 

Assume that in Triangle(A,B,X), one of the angles is Angle(1), which is 76 degrees, and another angle is Angle(2), which is 36 degrees. But then the third angle would be 180 - 76 - 36 = 68 degrees. Alternatively, maybe Angle(2) is part of another triangle. 

Alternatively, since AB is perpendicular to BC, creating a right angle at B. If we consider triangle ABC, which is a right triangle at B, then the other two angles sum to 90 degrees. But without knowing more about the sides or other angles, it's hard to tell. 

But the presence of other angles like Angle(3)=104, Angle(1)=76, Angle(7)=140, and Angle(8)=40 suggests that these angles might belong to other triangles or structures. 

For example, if Angle(3)=104 is part of a triangle, then maybe it's an exterior angle. 

Let me try to consider the possibility that Angle(1) is an angle in Triangle(A,B,X), and Angle(2) is another angle in that triangle. If Angle(1) is 76 degrees (as per X=76), and if Angle(2) is 36 degrees, then the third angle would be 180 - 76 - 36 = 68 degrees. But how does this relate to the rest of the problem?

Alternatively, maybe Angle(2) is part of another triangle, like Triangle(B,C,Y). 

Given that MeasureOf(Angle(7),Y) = 140 degrees, and Add(Y,40,180) implies Y=140. So Angle(7) is 140 degrees. 

If we consider Triangle(B,C,Y), the angles would sum to 180. Assuming that one angle is 140 degrees (Angle(7)), and another is 40 degrees (Angle(8)), then the third angle would be 180 - 140 - 40 = 0, which is impossible. So that can't be right. 

Wait, but Angle(8) is 40 degrees. Maybe Angle(8) is part of another triangle. 

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should focus on the fact that AB ⊥ BC creates a right angle, and use other angle measures to derive the missing ones. 

Let me recall that in the given predicates, there's a Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y). If I consider Triangle(A,B,X), and AB ⊥ BC, and assuming that X is positioned such that BX is part of BC, then maybe angle at B in Triangle(A,B,X) is supplementary to the right angle. 

For example, if AB is perpendicular to BC, and X is on the line BC extended, then angle ABX would be 180 - 90 = 90 degrees. So if angle at B in Triangle(A,B,X) is 90 degrees, then the triangle is right-angled at B. Then, if Angle(1) is one of the acute angles in this triangle, and Angle(2) is another, we could calculate them. 

Suppose in Triangle(A,B,X), angle at B is 90 degrees. Then the other two angles sum to 90 degrees. If Angle(1) is one of them, say 76 degrees (from earlier calculation), then the other angle would be 14 degrees. But this doesn't match any given measures. 

Alternatively, if Angle(1) is 76 degrees, and Angle(2) is 36 degrees, then the third angle would be 180 - 76 - 36 = 68 degrees. But how does this tie into the overall problem?

Wait, the question is asking for the measure of angle 2, which is given as 36 degrees in the predicates. But that conflicts with the idea that it needs to be calculated. Perhaps the given MeasureOf(Angle(2),36) is a mistake, and the actual value is to be found. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for Angle(2) in terms of other angles. For example, if angle 2 is part of a triangle where other angles are known. 

Another approach: Since AB ⊥ BC, and we have triangles involving these points, maybe we can use the fact that the sum of angles around point B is 360 degrees. But since AB and BC are perpendicular, the angle between them is 90 degrees. If there are other angles at B from the triangles, like in Triangle(A,B,X) and Triangle(B,C,Y), then their angles at B would add up with the 90-degree angle. 

For example, if in Triangle(A,B,X), the angle at B is β, and in Triangle(B,C,Y), the angle at B is γ, then β + γ + 90 = 360? No, because angles around a point sum to 360. But if AB and BC are two lines meeting at B, and other lines from B to X and B to Y, then the total angles around B would depend on how many lines are emanating from B. 

Assuming that X and Y are points such that lines BX and BY are present. If AB is perpendicular to BC, then AB forms a 90-degree angle with BC. If lines BX and BY are other directions from B, then the angles between AB and BX, and between BC and BY, etc., would contribute to the total. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's challenging. 

However, given that MeasureOf(Angle(1),X) and Add(X,104,180) gives X=76, and MeasureOf(Angle(7),Y) and Add(Y,40,180) gives Y=140, perhaps these angles are part of the triangles. 

For example, Angle(1) could be an angle in Triangle(A,B,X), and Angle(7) could be an angle in Triangle(B,C,Y). 

Let's consider Triangle(A,B,X): if one angle is 76 degrees (Angle(1)), and another is Angle(2) which we're trying to find, and the third angle is something else. If we can relate these to the right angle at B, perhaps we can find Angle(2). 

But if AB is perpendicular to BC, and assuming that in Triangle(A,B,X), the angle at B is part of the right angle, then maybe it's 90 degrees. If Angle(1) is 76 degrees, then the remaining angle would be 180 - 90 - 76 = 14 degrees. But this isn't matching any given measures. 

Alternatively, if the angle at B in Triangle(A,B,X) is not 90 degrees, but some other value. Let's say in Triangle(A,B,X), angles are 76 degrees (Angle(1)), x degrees, and y degrees, with x + y + 76 = 180. Without more info, it's hard to say. 

Maybe the key is to recognize that the sum of angles around point B is 360 degrees. Since AB is perpendicular to BC, the angle between AB and BC is 90 degrees. If there are other lines from B, like BX and BY, then the angles between AB and BX, BC and BY, etc., would contribute to the total. 

For example, if BX is part of Triangle(A,B,X), and BY is part of Triangle(B,C,Y), then the angles at B in these triangles would add up with the 90-degree angle. 

Suppose in Triangle(A,B,X), the angle at B is α, and in Triangle(B,C,Y), the angle at B is β. Then α + β + 90 = 360? No, because the sum of angles around a point is 360. So if AB and BC are two lines forming a 90-degree angle, and BX and BY are other lines from B, then the total angles would be: angle between AB and BX, between BX and BC, between BC and BY, and between BY and AB. But this depends on how many lines are present. 

If there are two additional lines from B (BX and BY), then the total angles would be: angle between AB and BX, plus angle between BX and BC, plus angle between BC and BY, plus angle between BY and AB. These sum to 360 degrees. 

But without knowing the specific arrangement, it's difficult to proceed. 

However, if we assume that in Triangle(A,B,X), the angle at B is supplementary to the right angle, then it would be 90 degrees. But this leads to contradictions in the previous calculations. 

Alternatively, perhaps Angle(1) is an external angle to the right triangle ABC. For example, if Angle(1) is an exterior angle at B, then it would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. 

But without a clear diagram, it's hard to determine. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the given options and the angle measures. 

The given options are A:64, B:68, C:72, D:76. 

From earlier, we found that X=76 (MeasureOf(Angle(1),X) and Add(X,104,180)), which might correspond to angle 1 being 76 degrees. If angle 2 is to be found, and there's a relationship between angles 1 and 2, perhaps via triangle sums. 

If in a triangle, two angles are 76 and 36, the third is 68. But if angle 2 is 36, then the answer would be 36, which is not among the options except possibly if there's a miscalculation. But the question asks to find angle 2, which is given as 36. This suggests that the actual value might be 76, but that's not in the options. 

Wait, but the options include 76 as option D. But the given MeasureOf(Angle(2),36) suggests it's 36. This is confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the MeasureOf(Angle(2),36) is a typo, and the actual value needs to be calculated. For example, if angle 2 is part of a triangle where other angles are known. 

Let me think about the right triangle ABC at B. If we consider triangle ABC, it has angles at A, B (90 degrees), and C. The sum of angles is 180, so angle at A + 90 + angle at C = 180 → angle at A + angle at C = 90. 

If angle 2 is one of these angles, say at A or C, but how? 

If angle 2 is part of another triangle, like Triangle(A,B,X), then maybe it relates to angle at A or C. 

Alternatively, if Angle(3) is 104 degrees, and it's an external angle to triangle ABC, then it equals the sum of the remote interior angles. For example, if Angle(3) is an exterior angle at A, then it would equal angle at B (90) + angle at C. So 104 = 90 + angle at C → angle at C = 14 degrees. But this doesn't seem helpful. 

Alternatively, if Angle(3) is an angle in Triangle(A,B,X), and it's 104 degrees, then the other angles in that triangle would sum to 76 degrees. 

But without knowing which angles are which, it's hard to proceed. 

Given the time I've spent and the uncertainty, I'll go with the earlier calculation where X=76, and if angle 2 is part of a triangle with angle 1=76 and another angle, then the missing angle would be 180 - 76 - 36 = 68, which is option B. 

But why would angle 2 be 36? If it's given as 36, but the question asks to find it, then perhaps the correct answer is 68. 

Alternatively, if the measure of angle 2 is 68, then the answer would be B. 

Given the options and the possibility that angle 2 is calculated as 68, I'll choose B.
