MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is about finding the domain of the piecewise function h, which goes through the points (-5,4), (3,3), (0,7), (3,1), and (5,-5). The answer choices are intervals from -5 to various upper bounds. 

First, I need to recall what the domain of a function means. The domain is the set of all possible x-values for which the function is defined. Since h is a piecewise function passing through these points, I think the domain would be determined by the x-coordinates of the points it passes through. But wait, maybe there's more to it? Like if the function is connecting those points with line segments, the domain could be continuous between the leftmost and rightmost x-values. Let me check the given points.

Looking at the coordinates: the first point is (-5,4), then (3,3), next (0,7), then (3,1), and finally (5,-5). Wait, but some of these points have the same x-coordinate. For example, there's a point at x=3 with y=3 and another at x=3 with y=1. That suggests that the function might have vertical segments or maybe overlaps? Hmm, but since it's a piecewise function, perhaps each segment connects consecutive points. However, the order of the points matters here. Are these points connected in the order given? Or is there a different order?

Wait, the problem says "goes through" these points, so I assume they're connected in the order listed. Let me list them again: (-5,4) → (3,3) → (0,7) → (3,1) → (5,-5). Wait, that seems odd because moving from (-5,4) to (3,3) is one segment, then from (3,3) to (0,7)? That would mean going back in x-direction from 3 to 0? Then from (0,7) to (3,1) again, and then to (5,-5). So the function isn't strictly increasing or decreasing in x; it has varying x-values. Therefore, the domain might not just be from the minimum x to maximum x. But how does that work?

Alternatively, maybe the points are ordered along the function's graph. So the function starts at x=-5, then moves to x=3, then to x=0, then to x=3 again, then to x=5. Wait, that seems like the x-values aren't necessarily increasing. So if the function is piecewise linear, each segment is between two consecutive points. So the domain would be all x-values covered by the union of the x-ranges of each segment.

But each segment's x-range depends on its endpoints. Let's consider each segment:

1. From (-5,4) to (3,3): This segment spans x from -5 to 3. So the x-values here are between -5 and 3.
2. From (3,3) to (0,7): Here, the x-values go from 3 down to 0. So x ranges from 0 to 3.
3. From (0,7) to (3,1): x increases from 0 to 3 again.
4. From (3,1) to (5,-5): x increases from 3 to 5.

So combining all these x-intervals: the first segment covers [-5, 3], the second covers [0, 3], third [0, 3], fourth [3,5]. So overall, the entire domain would be from -5 up to 5. Because the first segment starts at -5 and ends at 3, then the last segment ends at 5. There's overlap between the segments. So the total domain is from -5 to 5. 

Wait, but let me make sure. The first segment's x goes from -5 to 3, then the next part goes from 3 back to 0, then from 0 to 3 again, then to 5. So the full range of x-values covered is from -5 to 5. Hence, the domain is all real numbers between -5 and 5 inclusive. Looking at the answer choices:

A: -5 ≤x ≤7 → upper bound 7, too high.

B: -5 ≤x ≤4 → upper bound 4, but our max x is 5.

C: -5 ≤x ≤5 → matches our conclusion.

D: -5 ≤x ≤6 → upper bound 6, still higher than 5.

Therefore, the correct answer should be C. But let me double-check. Is there any possibility that the function might extend beyond these points? Since it's a piecewise function connecting those points, the domain is determined by the x-values of the points connected. Each segment is between two consecutive points, so the domain is the combination of all x-values across all segments. Since the leftmost x is -5 and the rightmost is 5, the domain is from -5 to 5. Thus, answer C.
