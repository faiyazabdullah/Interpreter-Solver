MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

We have points A, B, C, D, E, and O. Lines AB, CD, DE, OE, OD, OC, OB, OA. There's a circle centered at O, and all these points lie on the circle. So O is the center because all those lines are radii. Also, AB and CD are diameters, so they pass through O and are straight lines across the circle. Then there's a chord DE that's parallel to AB. The measure of angle EOD is given as 50 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle BOC.

First, since AB and CD are diameters, they must intersect at O, which is the center. The fact that DE is parallel to AB suggests some relationship between the angles formed. Since DE is a chord, and it's parallel to AB, which is a diameter, maybe we can use properties of parallel lines and arcs in a circle.

Given that DE is parallel to AB, and AB is a diameter, then DE is a chord parallel to another diameter. In such cases, the arcs subtended by these chords might relate. Also, angle EOD is given as 50 degrees. That angle is at the center, so it's a central angle corresponding to arc ED. Therefore, the measure of arc ED is 50 degrees.

Since AB is a diameter, it spans 180 degrees. Now, because DE is parallel to AB, the arc that DE subtends should be related to the position where DE is placed. But how does this affect other arcs?

Let me think about the circle. Let's consider the positions of the points. Points A and B are endpoints of one diameter, so they're directly opposite each other. Similarly, C and D are endpoints of another diameter. Wait, but wait—CD is also a diameter. However, the lines CD, DE, etc., are mentioned. Also, point E is connected to D via line DE, which is a chord. And E lies on the circle too.

Now, since DE is parallel to AB, which is a diameter. In a circle, if two chords are parallel, certain properties hold. For instance, the arcs they intercept might be related. Alternatively, since DE is parallel to AB, the angles formed by these lines with other elements could be considered.

But angle EOD is given as 50 degrees. Since O is the center, that angle corresponds to arc ED. Therefore, arc ED measures 50 degrees. Now, since AB is a diameter, it divides the circle into two semicircles. The chord DE is parallel to AB. Let me visualize this. Suppose AB is horizontal, going from left to right. Then DE, being parallel to AB, would also be horizontal. But since DE is a chord, its position depends on where it's located.

Wait, but DE connects D to E. Since D is an endpoint of diameter CD, so D is on the circle. Point E is also on the circle. So DE is a chord starting at D and ending at E. Given that DE is parallel to AB, which is a diameter. Let me try to imagine the circle with AB and CD as diameters. Let me assume AB is horizontal. Then CD is another diameter; depending on the orientation, maybe vertical? Or perhaps at some angle. But since DE is parallel to AB, and D is on CD, which is a diameter. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe AB and CD are perpendicular? Not necessarily unless specified. Wait, the problem doesn't say that. It just says AB and CD are diameters. They could be at any angle. However, DE is parallel to AB. Let me think about the implications of DE being parallel to AB.

Since DE is parallel to AB, which is a diameter, and DE is a chord. When two chords are parallel in a circle, the arcs they cut off may have specific relationships. Also, considering that DE is parallel to AB, the distance from the center O to each chord might be related. However, since AB is a diameter, its distance from the center O is zero. So DE, being parallel to AB, must be equidistant from O? Wait, no. Because AB passes through O, so DE is parallel to AB but not passing through O. Thus, the distance from O to DE is non-zero. But how does that help?

Alternatively, since DE is parallel to AB, the angle between DE and CD might be related to the angle between AB and CD. But I'm not sure yet.

Another thought: since DE is parallel to AB, the arc that DE subtends (arc ED) relates to the arc that AB subtends. But AB is a diameter, so its subtended arc is 180 degrees. However, DE is a different chord. Wait, but maybe there's a way to find the measure of arc BD or something like that.

Wait, the problem asks for angle BOC. Points B and C are both on the circle, with O being the center. So angle BOC is a central angle. The measure of angle BOC is equal to the measure of arc BC. Therefore, if we can find the measure of arc BC, that will give us angle BOC.

So how do we find arc BC? Let's see. We know that arc ED is 50 degrees. Also, AB and CD are diameters. Let me consider the positions of the points. Let me try to reconstruct the diagram mentally.

Assume O is the center. AB is a diameter, so A and B are endpoints. CD is another diameter, so C and D are endpoints. Then DE is a chord parallel to AB. Let me try to place the points. Let me imagine AB horizontal. Then CD is another diameter, perhaps at some angle θ. Then DE is parallel to AB, so DE is horizontal. Since D is on CD, which is a diameter, so D is either on the upper half or lower half of the circle. Let me suppose that D is on the right side of the circle. Then DE is a horizontal chord starting at D. Since DE is horizontal and parallel to AB, which is horizontal. So E is somewhere on the circle such that DE is horizontal.

But since DE is a chord, E must be on the opposite side of the circle relative to D along the horizontal direction. Wait, but D is already on the circle. Let me think of coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates would help.

Let me set up coordinate system with O at origin. Let’s take AB as x-axis. So O is (0,0). Let’s say A is (-r, 0), B is (r, 0), where r is radius. Then CD is another diameter. Let me assume CD is at some angle φ. Let me assign coordinates to C and D. Suppose CD is making an angle φ with the x-axis. So if C is at (r cos φ, r sin φ), then D would be at (-r cos φ, -r sin φ) because CD is a diameter. Wait, no—if C and D are endpoints of diameter CD, then if C is at angle φ, D would be at φ + π radians. So coordinates of C: (r cos φ, r sin φ), D: (r cos(φ+π), r sin(φ+π)) = (-r cos φ, -r sin φ).

Then DE is a horizontal chord (parallel to AB, which is x-axis). So DE has slope 0. Since D is at (-r cos φ, -r sin φ), then E must be horizontally aligned with D. So the y-coordinate of E is same as D, which is -r sin φ. But E is on the circle. So coordinates of E satisfy x² + y² = r². Since y-coordinate is fixed as -r sin φ, so substituting:

x² + ( -r sin φ )² = r² → x² + r² sin² φ = r² → x² = r² (1 - sin² φ) = r² cos² φ → x = ± r cos φ. 

Therefore, E has coordinates (r cos φ, -r sin φ) or (-r cos φ, -r sin φ). But D is at (-r cos φ, -r sin φ), so E cannot be the same as D. Hence, E must be at (r cos φ, -r sin φ). Therefore, E is the reflection of D over the y-axis? Wait, no. Wait, original D is (-r cos φ, -r sin φ), and E is (r cos φ, -r sin φ). So DE is the line connecting (-r cos φ, -r sin φ) to (r cos φ, -r sin φ), which is indeed horizontal, as expected. The length of DE is 2r cos φ, since the difference in x-coordinates is 2r cos φ, and y is same. 

Now, the measure of angle EOD is given as 50 degrees. Let's compute angle EOD. Points E, O, D. O is the origin. Coordinates of E: (r cos φ, -r sin φ). Coordinates of D: (-r cos φ, -r sin φ). Vector OE is (cos φ, -sin φ) assuming unit circle (for simplicity). Vector OD is (-cos φ, -sin φ). The angle between vectors OE and OD can be found using the dot product.

Dot product of OE and OD is (cos φ)(-cos φ) + (-sin φ)(-sin φ) = -cos² φ + sin² φ = -(cos² φ - sin² φ) = -cos(2φ). The magnitude of each vector is 1 (since unit circle). Therefore, cos(theta) = -cos(2φ), where theta is angle EOD. Given that theta is 50 degrees, so:

cos(theta) = -cos(2φ)

Which gives:

cos(50°) = -cos(2φ)

Therefore,

cos(2φ) = -cos(50°) = cos(180° - 50°) = cos(130°)

Thus, 2φ = 130° or 2φ = -130°, leading to φ = 65° or φ = -65°, etc. Depending on the quadrant. Assuming standard position, φ is positive. So φ = 65°, so that 2φ=130°, so cos(2φ)=cos(130°)= -cos(50°). That works.

So φ is 65°, meaning that diameter CD makes an angle of 65° with the x-axis (AB). Now, we need to find angle BOC. Points B and C. Point B is at (r, 0). Point C is at (r cos φ, r sin φ). So coordinates of C: (r cos 65°, r sin 65°). So angle BOC is the angle between vectors OB and OC. Vector OB is along the x-axis, from O to B: (1,0). Vector OC is (cos 65°, sin 65°). The angle between them is simply 65°, since OC is at angle φ = 65° from the x-axis. Wait, but angle BOC is the central angle between points B and C. Since B is at angle 0°, and C is at angle φ = 65°, so the central angle BOC is 65°, hence angle BOC is 65°? But none of the options is 65. Wait, the answer choices are A:115°, B:100°, C:80°, D:50°. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe my assumption here is wrong.

Wait, but earlier I thought that angle EOD is 50°, which led to φ = 65°, giving angle BOC as 65°, but that's not among the options. So something's wrong here. Where did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me re-examine the calculation. Angle EOD was computed as 50 degrees. From the coordinates, angle EOD is between vectors OE and OD. Earlier, I said that vectors OE and OD are (cos φ, -sin φ) and (-cos φ, -sin φ). Wait, no. Let me double-check. 

Coordinates of E: (r cos φ, -r sin φ) — yes. Coordinates of D: (-r cos φ, -r sin φ). So vector OE is (cos φ, -sin φ), vector OD is (-cos φ, -sin φ). Then the angle between them is calculated as follows:

Dot product: (cos φ)(-cos φ) + (-sin φ)(-sin φ) = -cos² φ + sin² φ = -cos(2φ). 

Yes. So cos(theta) = -cos(2φ). Given theta is 50 degrees, so:

-cos(2φ) = cos(50°)

Which means cos(2φ) = -cos(50°) = cos(180° - 50°) = cos(130°). So 2φ = 130°, so φ = 65°, as before.

But angle BOC is the angle between OB (which is along the x-axis) and OC. Point C is at angle φ = 65°, so angle BOC is 65°, but that's not an option. So this suggests inconsistency. Therefore, my previous reasoning is flawed. Perhaps I made a wrong assumption in setting up coordinates?

Wait, but the problem states that DE is parallel to AB. In my coordinate setup, DE is horizontal, as AB is horizontal. So that part seems okay. However, maybe the angle EOD isn't 50 degrees but refers to the angle between EO and OD. Wait, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(E,O,D),50.0). So that's angle at O between E and D, which is angle EOD, which I calculated as 50 degrees. So according to my calculation, angle EOD is 50°, which leads to φ = 65°, but angle BOC would be 65°, which is not among the options. So something's wrong here.

Alternative approach: Maybe I misapplied the angle. Let's think differently. Since DE is parallel to AB, which is a diameter. In a circle, if two chords are parallel, the arcs they intercept may have supplementary angles or something. Also, the arc between the endpoints of the chords could be related.

Alternatively, since DE || AB, then the arc subtended by DE (arc ED) and the arc subtended by AB (which is 180 degrees) might have some relation. For example, if two chords are parallel, the arcs they intercept are either equal or supplementary. Wait, but AB is a diameter, so its arc is 180°, while DE's arc is 50°, which is much smaller. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another idea: Since DE is parallel to AB, then the arc from D to E (arc DE) is equal to the arc from A to B minus some amount, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since DE is parallel to AB, then the angle between DE and CD equals the angle between AB and CD. But CD is another diameter. Let me think.

Wait, AB and CD are diameters. Let me denote the angle between AB and CD as θ. Then, since DE is parallel to AB, the angle between DE and CD would also be θ. But how does that help?

Alternatively, since DE is parallel to AB, then the arc that DE subtends (arc ED) and the arc that AB subtends (arc AB, which is 180°) might form a relationship. For example, if two chords are parallel, then the arcs they intercept are either equal or supplementary. But since AB is a diameter (arc 180°) and DE is a chord with arc 50°, which is not supplementary or equal. So this approach may not work.

Wait, but maybe there's another property. Let me recall that when two chords are parallel, the arcs between their endpoints may add up to something. For example, if AB and DE are parallel, then the arcs intercepted by AB and DE could be related. Alternatively, since DE is parallel to AB, the arc from D to E plus the arc from A to B equals 180°, but I don't see why.

Wait, maybe I need to look at the entire configuration. Let me try again with a different method.

Given that AB and CD are diameters, so they intersect at O. DE is a chord parallel to AB. So AB and DE are parallel. Since AB is a diameter, and DE is parallel to it, then the distance from O to DE is constant. Also, since DE is a chord, the perpendicular distance from O to DE is d. For AB, which is a diameter, the distance from O to AB is zero, since AB passes through O.

Because DE is parallel to AB, and AB passes through O, then DE must be a chord at some distance from O. Let me denote the length of DE. Since DE is parallel to AB, and AB is a diameter, which has length 2r. The length of DE can be calculated using the formula for chord length: 2√(r² - d²), where d is the distance from the center to the chord. But since AB is a diameter, its distance is 0, so its length is 2r. For DE, the distance from O is d, so length is 2√(r² - d²). But without knowing the actual length, maybe this isn't helpful.

However, we know the measure of arc ED is 50°, so the central angle EOD is 50°, which implies that the length of DE is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Wait, the length of a chord is 2r sin(θ/2), where θ is the central angle. Here, θ is 50°, so DE = 2r sin(25°).

But AB is a diameter, length 2r. So the ratio between DE and AB is sin(25°)/1 ≈ 0.4226. Not sure if that helps.

Now, we need to find angle BOC. Points B and C are endpoints of diameters AB and CD respectively. Wait, CD is a diameter, so C and D are endpoints. So angle BOC is the angle between OB and OC. To find this angle, we need to determine the angular separation between points B and C around the circle.

To find this, perhaps we can find the measure of arc BC. How?

Let me consider the positions of points. Since AB and CD are diameters, and DE is parallel to AB. Let me consider the angles involved.

Since DE is parallel to AB, and AB is a diameter, then the angle between DE and CD is equal to the angle between AB and CD. Because if two lines are parallel, then the angle between them and a transversal is equal.

So, let me denote angle between AB and CD as α. Then angle between DE and CD is also α. But how does this help?

Let me think of the diagram. Let me imagine AB as horizontal diameter. CD is another diameter, forming an angle α with AB. DE is parallel to AB, so DE forms the same angle α with CD. Let me draw this.

At point D, which is on diameter CD, DE goes off in a direction parallel to AB. So the angle between CD and DE is α. This angle α would be the same as the angle between AB and CD. 

In terms of arcs, the angle between AB and CD is determined by the angular separation between points A and C, or B and D, depending on the direction. Wait, maybe I need to express this in terms of arcs.

Alternatively, since DE is parallel to AB, and DE subtends an arc of 50°, then maybe the arc that AB subtends is related. But AB is a diameter, so arc AB is 180°, but DE is a chord subtending 50°, so maybe there's a way to relate these.

Wait, if DE is parallel to AB, then the arc from D to E (50°) and the arc from A to B (180°) are related. Perhaps the sum of these arcs equals 180°? No, that doesn't seem to fit. Or maybe the arc from D to E plus the arc from A to B equals 180°? But 50 + 180 = 230 > 180, which isn't possible.

Alternative idea: Since DE is parallel to AB, then the arc between D and E is equal to the arc between A and B subtracted by some amount. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider the total circumference. The circle is 360°. Arc AB is 180°, arc DE is 50°. What about other arcs? Let me think about the positions of points C and D.

Since CD is a diameter, points C and D are separated by 180°. Let me assume that AB and CD are not overlapping. So, if AB is horizontal, CD is at some angle. Let me try to find the positions of points B, O, C.

Angle BOC is the angle between OB and OC. If I can find the angular position of C relative to B, then that angle is the measure of angle BOC.

Since CD is a diameter, and D is one end, C is the other end. Let me consider the position of D. Since DE is parallel to AB, and D is on CD, which is a diameter. Let me consider the angle between CD and DE. As DE is parallel to AB, this angle is the same as the angle between AB and CD. Let's call this angle β.

At point D, the line DE makes angle β with CD. Since DE is parallel to AB, and AB is a diameter, the angle between AB and CD is β. Let me try to relate this to the arc.

The central angle corresponding to arc DC is 180°, since CD is a diameter. Let me consider the arc from D to E. This is 50°, as per the given. Now, since DE is parallel to AB, the angle between DE and CD is β, which is the same as the angle between AB and CD. Let me try to relate this to arcs.

Imagine extending CD beyond D to meet DE. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, since DE is parallel to AB, and AB is a diameter, then the arc from A to B is 180°, and the arc from D to E is 50°. Perhaps there's a symmetry or rotational relationship here.

Alternatively, think about the rotation from AB to DE. Since DE is parallel to AB, rotating AB by some angle would align it with DE. The angle between AB and DE is zero, but since they are parallel. However, since DE is a chord, not a diameter, the rotation would involve moving along the circle.

This is getting complicated. Maybe using the earlier coordinate system approach, but correcting the error.

Earlier, I assumed that angle BOC was φ, but perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the position of point C. Let me revisit that.

In the coordinate system, AB is along x-axis, O is at origin. D is at (-r cos φ, -r sin φ), E is at (r cos φ, -r sin φ). So DE is horizontal. Then CD is a diameter, so C is the other end of diameter CD. Since D is at (-r cos φ, -r sin φ), then C is diametrically opposite to D, so adding π radians to the angle of D. Original angle for D is φ + π radians? Wait, no. If D is at angle θ, then C would be at θ + π radians. Wait, earlier, I had defined D as at angle φ + π, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, earlier I considered that if C is at angle φ, then D would be at angle φ + π. But in reality, since CD is a diameter, if D is at angle θ, then C is at θ + π radians. So if D is at (-r cos φ, -r sin φ), then its angle is φ + π radians. So C is at φ radians. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

If D is at (-r cos φ, -r sin φ), then its polar angle is π + φ radians. Because cosine of π + φ is -cos φ, sine is -sin φ. So the angle for D is π + φ. Therefore, the diameter CD extends from C to D, where C is at angle π + φ - π = φ radians. So point C is at angle φ radians. Therefore, coordinates of C are (r cos φ, r sin φ).

Now, point B is at (r, 0), which is angle 0 radians. Point C is at angle φ radians. So angle BOC is the angle between OB (at 0 radians) and OC (at φ radians), which is φ radians. So angle BOC is φ. Earlier, we found that φ = 65°, because angle EOD was 50°, leading to 2φ = 130°, so φ = 65°. So angle BOC would be 65°, but this isn't an option. So where is the mistake?

Wait, but maybe angle EOD isn't 2φ. Let me recalculate. Earlier, I said that angle EOD is between vectors OE and OD. With OE at angle φ (point C) and OD at angle π + φ (point D)? No, wait. Wait, point E is at (r cos φ, -r sin φ). Let me calculate its angle. The angle of point E is measured from the positive x-axis. Its coordinates are (cos φ, -sin φ) if normalized. So the angle is -φ or equivalently 2π - φ. 

Point D is at (-cos φ, -sin φ), which has angle π + φ. So angle between OE and OD is the difference between their angles. The angle of OE is -φ (or 2π - φ), and angle of OD is π + φ. So the angle between them is (π + φ) - (-φ) = π + 2φ. But this angle is supposed to be 50°, so π + 2φ = 50°? Wait, no, angles in radians or degrees?

Wait, previously, I used degrees. So if angle EOD is 50 degrees, then π + 2φ = 50°, but π is 180 degrees. So:

π + 2φ = 50° → 180° + 2φ = 50° → 2φ = -130° → φ = -65°. Which would mean φ is -65°, but angles are typically taken as positive. Alternatively, maybe I got the direction wrong. Let me think again.

The angle between vectors OE and OD is the smallest angle between them. The angle between OE (at angle -φ) and OD (at angle π + φ) is the absolute difference between their angles. Let me calculate:

The angle of OE is -φ (equivalent to 360° - φ). The angle of OD is π + φ (180° + φ). The difference between these angles is (180° + φ) - (360° - φ) = 180° + φ - 360° + φ = 2φ - 180°. But since angles are modulo 360°, this could be negative. To get the smallest angle, we take the minimum between |2φ - 180| and 360 - |2φ - 180|. 

But given that angle EOD is 50°, so we have:

|2φ - 180| = 50° or 360 - |2φ - 180| = 50°. Let's solve both possibilities.

Case 1: 2φ - 180 = 50 → 2φ = 230 → φ = 115°.

Case 2: 2φ - 180 = -50 → 2φ = 130 → φ = 65°.

Also, the other case: 360 - |2φ - 180| = 50 → |2φ - 180| = 310. But since maximum angle is 180°, this is not possible. So valid solutions are φ = 115° or φ = 65°.

So φ could be 65° or 115°. Let's check both.

First, φ = 65°: angle between OE and OD is 50°, which fits. Then angle BOC is φ = 65°, which is not an option. But if φ = 115°, then angle BOC is 115°, which is option A.

So why did we get two solutions? Because the angle between vectors can be measured in two directions. If φ is 65°, then the angle between OE and OD is 50°, but if φ is 115°, then 2φ - 180 = 230 - 180 = 50°, so the angle is 50°. Both are valid.

But why are there two solutions? It depends on the position of point D. If φ is 65°, then point D is at angle π + φ = 180° + 65° = 245°, and point E is at -φ = -65° = 360° - 65° = 295°. The angle between OD (245°) and OE (295°) is 295 - 245 = 50°, which is correct. Alternatively, if φ = 115°, then OD is at π + 115° = 180 + 115 = 295°, and OE is at -115° = 245°, so the angle between OD (295°) and OE (245°) is 295 - 245 = 50°, same result. So both φ = 65° and φ = 115° are possible, depending on the direction of the angle.

So angle BOC is φ, which could be 65° or 115°. But why?

Because depending on whether φ is acute or obtuse. But in the context of the problem, which one is correct? Let me think about the diagram. DE is parallel to AB. If φ is 65°, then DE is positioned such that it's to the right of the center, whereas if φ is 115°, it's to the left. But since DE is a chord parallel to AB, and AB is a diameter, both configurations are possible.

But the problem mentions that DE is a chord, and that it's parallel to AB. Also, the measure of angle EOD is 50°, which is given. Both scenarios satisfy this condition. So how to choose between 65° and 115°?

Perhaps looking at the other parts of the diagram. For example, the presence of point C and D as endpoints of diameter CD. If φ is 65°, then point C is at angle 65°, and point D is at 245°. If φ is 115°, then point C is at 115°, and D is at 295°. 

Now, angle BOC is the angle between OB (point B at 0°) and OC (point C at φ). So if φ is 65°, angle BOC is 65°, but this isn't an option. If φ is 115°, then angle BOC is 115°, which is option A.

But why would the problem provide two possible solutions? Probably because of the ambiguity in the direction of the angle. However, in typical geometry problems, diagrams are usually drawn in a particular orientation. Let me consider the possibility that φ is 115°, leading to angle BOC of 115°, which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps there's another constraint I missed. Let me think: in the problem, DE is a chord, and it's parallel to AB. Also, the diagram shows that DE is likely placed in a certain way. If φ is 65°, then DE is to the right of the circle, but if φ is 115°, it's to the left. However, without more info, it's ambiguous. But since the answer options include 115°, which is option A, and 65° isn't listed, it suggests that the correct answer is 115°, so angle BOC is 115°, which is option A.

Hence, the correct answer should be A:115°.
