MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have an isosceles triangle with two sides of length 13 and a base of 10. We need to find its area. Hmm, right. Let me recall how to find the area of a triangle when I know the lengths of all sides. Wait, there's Heron's formula, but maybe there's a simpler way since it's an isosceles triangle.

Wait, the problem also mentions an altitude. Oh, right! In an isosceles triangle, the altitude from the apex (the top vertex) to the base splits the triangle into two congruent right triangles. That might be helpful. Because if I can find the height, then the area is just (base * height)/2.

So let me think. The base is 10 units long. The two equal sides are each 13 units. When I draw the altitude, it divides the base into two equal parts because the triangle is isosceles. So each half of the base is 10/2 = 5 units. Now, the altitude forms a right triangle with one of the equal sides. The hypotenuse of this right triangle is 13 (the original side), one leg is 5 (half the base), and the other leg is the altitude we need to find.

Using the Pythagorean theorem here. Let me write that down. For the right triangle: (altitude)^2 + (5)^2 = (13)^2. Solving for the altitude: altitude^2 = 13² - 5². Calculating that, 13 squared is 169, 5 squared is 25. Subtracting gives 144. Then the square root of 144 is 12. So the altitude is 12 units long.

Now, the area of the original triangle is (base * height)/2. Plugging in the numbers: (10 * 12)/2. That equals 120/2 = 60. So the area should be 60. Looking at the answer choices, B is 60. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
