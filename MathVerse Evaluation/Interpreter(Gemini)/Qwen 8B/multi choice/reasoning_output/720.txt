MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two similar cylinders with volumes 5760 cm³ and 90 cm³. We need to find the ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the smaller one. 

First, I remember that when dealing with similar figures, the ratio of their volumes is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. Since they're cylinders, their similarity would mean that their radii and heights are proportional. But the question specifically asks for the volume ratio, so maybe I don't need to find the actual dimensions?

Wait, but the problem already gives the volumes directly. Let me check the given predicates again. Oh right, there's a predicate stating Equals(RatioOf(VolumeOf(Cylinder(1)), VolumeOf(Cylinder(2))), RatioOf(5760, 90)). Wait, but that seems like it's just restating the given volumes. Maybe that's part of the setup? Or perhaps there's more to it?

But the question says to find the ratio of the larger to the smaller volume. The volumes given are 5760 and 90. So the ratio would be 5760 divided by 90. Let me compute that. Dividing 5760 by 90... Well, 90 times 60 is 5400, subtract that from 5760, we get 360 left. Then 90 goes into 360 four times. So total is 64. So 5760 / 90 = 64. Therefore, the ratio is 64:1. 

But wait, since the cylinders are similar, does that affect the ratio? Because if they were similar, the volume ratio should be the cube of the scale factor. However, the problem already gives the volumes, so even if they are similar, the ratio is just the quotient of the given volumes. Unless there's something missing here. Let me think again. 

The problem states that the cylinders are similar, so their volume ratio is indeed the cube of the ratio of their heights (or radii). But since the problem gives us the volumes directly, the ratio is simply 5760/90, which simplifies to 64. Therefore, the answer should be 64. 

Looking back at the answer choices, though, the user mentioned "No choices found." Hmm, but maybe the answer options weren't listed here. However, according to the instructions, I need to provide the answer as one of the letters A-D. Since the calculation leads to 64, which is 64/1, the ratio is 64:1. Assuming that the answer choices included this, the correct answer would be the option representing 64:1. But since the user hasn't provided the choices, I'll proceed with the calculation. 

So, the final answer is 64, so if the options were labeled A to D with 64 being one of them, the answer would be that letter. But without seeing the choices, I can only state the numerical answer, but per the instructions, I need to pick a letter. Wait, maybe the original problem had options where 64 was an option. Since the user said "No choices found," perhaps there was an error. But regardless, based on the given info, the ratio is 64.
