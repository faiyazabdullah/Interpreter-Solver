MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right isosceles triangle where the hypotenuse is 20 units long, and we need to find the length of the legs, which are labeled as x. 

First, I remember that in a right isosceles triangle, the two legs are equal in length. That makes sense because "isosceles" means two sides are equal, and since it's a right triangle, those two equal sides must be the ones forming the right angle. So, both legs are x, and the hypotenuse is given as 20.

Now, the Pythagorean theorem comes into play here. For a right-angled triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse. The formula is a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse. Since it's an isosceles right triangle, a and b are both x. So substituting, we get x² + x² = 20². Simplifying that gives 2x² = 400. Then dividing both sides by 2, x² = 200. Taking the square root of both sides, x = √200. 

Wait, but √200 can be simplified. Let me check that. √200 is √(100*2) which is 10√2. And since √2 is approximately 1.4142, multiplying by 10 gives about 14.142. Rounding to the nearest tenth would be 14.1. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 14.1. So that should be the answer. 

Let me verify if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using trigonometry? In a right isosceles triangle, the angles are 45°, 45°, and 90°. The legs are opposite the 45° angles, so maybe using sine or cosine. For example, sin(45°) = opposite/hypotenuse. So sin(45°) = x / 20. Since sin(45°) is √2/2, then x = 20*(√2/2) = 10√2, same as before. Yep, same result. 

So whether using the Pythagorean theorem directly or trigonometric ratios, we arrive at x being 10√2, which approximates to 14.1. Therefore, the correct answer should be option C.
