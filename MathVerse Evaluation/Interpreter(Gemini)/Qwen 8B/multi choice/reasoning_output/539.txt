====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the period of a trigonometric function based on its given minimum and maximum points. The points mentioned are (-π/2, 2.4) and (3π/2, 13). Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that for trigonometric functions like sine or cosine, the period is the distance between two consecutive maximum or minimum points. Wait, but actually, the period is the length of one full cycle. Let me think. For example, if you have a sine wave, the distance between two peaks (maxima) is the period. Similarly between two troughs (minima). But here, we have a minimum and a maximum. So maybe the distance between these two points relates to half the period?

Wait, let me recall. The general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A sin(Bx + C) + D. The period is 2π / |B|. Now, the maxima and minima occur at intervals of half the period. Because the function goes from max to min to max again, so the distance between a max and the next min is half the period. Or wait, maybe between a max and the next max is the full period. Let me confirm.

Suppose we have a standard sine function, y = sin(x), which has a period of 2π. Its maxima occur at π/2 + 2πk and minima at 3π/2 + 2πk. So the distance between a max and the next min is π, which is half the period. Therefore, if we know the x-values of a max and a min, the difference between them would be half the period. Therefore, the period would be twice that difference.

So in our case, the x-coordinates of the maximum and minimum are -π/2 and 3π/2. Let's compute the difference between these two x-values. 

Calculating the difference: 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 3π/2 + π/2 = 4π/2 = 2π. Wait, that's the difference between the max and the min. But according to my earlier thought, that should be half the period. So if the difference is 2π, then the period would be 4π? Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. Suppose the maximum occurs at x1 and the minimum at x2. Then the time between x1 and x2 is half the period. So the period would be 2*(x2 - x1). But in our case, x1 is -π/2 and x2 is 3π/2. So x2 - x1 = 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 3π/2 + π/2 = 2π. Then the period would be 2*2π = 4π? That seems high. Wait, but let's think about another way.

Alternatively, maybe the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum is half the period. Let's take the standard sine curve. From max to min is half a period. So if the horizontal distance between max and min is Δx, then the period T = 2Δx. 

In this problem, the horizontal distance between the max (at 3π/2) and the min (at -π/2) is 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 2π. So the period would be 2*(2π) = 4π? Wait, but that would make the period 4π. However, let me consider another perspective. Maybe the difference between the max and min is half the period. Let me check with a sample function.

Take y = sin(x). The first maximum is at π/2, the next minimum at 3π/2. The difference between those is π, which is half the period. Since the period is 2π, yes. So the horizontal distance between max and min is half the period. Therefore, if the horizontal distance is 2π, then the period would be 4π. 

But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose a function with period T. The distance between max and min is T/2. So if that distance is 2π, then T=4π. But in this problem, the horizontal distance between the given max and min is 2π. Hence, the period would be 4π. 

However, let me also check the coordinates again. The minimum is at x=-π/2 and maximum at x=3π/2. So the difference in x is indeed 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 2π. Therefore, the period is 2*(difference) = 4π. 

But wait, maybe there's another way to look at it. For instance, sometimes people might measure from the start of a cycle. Let me think. Suppose the function starts at a minimum, then goes up to a maximum, then back down. The distance between the minimum and maximum would be half the period. So if that distance is 2π, then the full period is 4π. 

Alternatively, could there be other factors? Like phase shifts or vertical shifts? The problem mentions the minimum and maximum points, but doesn't mention anything else. So assuming the function is of the form y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, where the amplitude is (max - min)/2. But since they gave us the x-values, the period depends only on the horizontal distance between max and min. 

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. So the period is 4π. Wait, but let me check once more. Let me calculate the difference between the two x-values. 

Minimum at x = -π/2, maximum at x = 3π/2. Difference is 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 3π/2 + π/2 = 4π/2 = 2π. So that's the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum. As per the previous logic, that's half the period. So period is 2*(2π) = 4π. 

But wait, another way: suppose the function completes a full cycle between the minimum and the next minimum. So starting at a minimum, going up to maximum, then back to minimum. So the distance from min to max is half the period. So the total period is double that distance. 

Thus, the period is 4π. 

But let me check if there's another possibility. Suppose the given points are not the first max and min, but some other points. For example, if the function is shifted, then the horizontal distance between max and min still represents half the period regardless of the shift. Because shifting the function left or right does not change the period. So even if the function is shifted, the distance between a max and a min is always half the period. 

Hence, the answer should be 4π. 

But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user provided certain predicates. Let me check if those are relevant. The given predicates include Equals(A, Div(-1,2)), Mul(A, pi), Equals(A, 2.4), Equals(B, Div(3,2)), Mul(B, pi), Equals(B, 13). 

Wait, perhaps these are meant to represent the coordinates of the points. For example, the minimum point is (-1/2, 2.4) and maximum is (3/2, 13). Wait, but the x-coordinate of the minimum is -1/2, which is -π/2? Wait, maybe there's confusion here. The problem says the graph has a minimum at (-π/2, 2.4) and a maximum at (3π/2, 13). So the x-coordinates are -π/2 and 3π/2. But the given predicates mention Div(-1,2) which is -1/2, and Div(3,2) which is 3/2. So perhaps the x-coordinates are -π/2 and 3π/2, but the problem's actual coordinates are written as (-1/2, 2.4) and (3/2, 13)? Wait, that can't be. Unless the x-coordinates are in terms of π. 

Wait, the original question says: "It has a minimum point at (-1/2 π, 2.4)" and "maximum point at (3/2 π, 13)". So the x-coordinates are -π/2 and 3π/2. So the horizontal distance between these two points is 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 2π. Which gives the period as 4π. 

But let me check again. If the horizontal distance between the max and min is 2π, then the period is 4π. So the answer is 4π. 

But the problem says to give the exact value. So 4π is exact. So the answer should be 4π. However, looking at the answer choices, the user said "No choices found." But according to the instructions, I need to provide the answer as one of the options, but since there are no choices, maybe the answer is 4π. But how do I know? The problem didn't list answer choices, but the user instructed to pick from A-D. Wait, the initial message says "Answer Choices: No choices found." So perhaps the answer is 4π, but since the system requires selecting A-D, but there are no options, perhaps the user expects me to just state the answer as 4π, but according to the output format, I have to choose A-D. 

Wait, but the problem may have had answer choices that were not included here. But according to the user's input, the answer choices are "No choices found." So maybe the user intended for me to write the answer directly. However, the instruction says to select the correct answer choice, but since there are none, perhaps the answer is 4π. But the output format requires choosing A-D. This is confusing. However, given that the problem asks for the period, and based on the calculation, the answer is 4π. But without answer choices, I'm supposed to provide the answer as per the process. 

But according to the instructions, the assistant must end with Final Answer: A/B/C/D. However, the problem states "No choices found", implying that there are no answer choices. But the user wants the assistant to proceed. Maybe there was an error in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 2π, but that contradicts the calculation. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. 

If the x-values are -π/2 and 3π/2, then the difference is 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 2π. That's the horizontal distance between the max and the min. Since that's half the period, the full period is 4π. 

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 4π. But since there are no answer choices, but the system requires selecting one of A-D, perhaps there was an error. However, according to the problem's structure, the user might expect the answer to be 4π. But without knowing the answer choices, it's impossible to select A-D. 

But the user's instruction says to "select the correct answer choice" and "if no exact match, select the closest reasonable option". Since there are no choices, perhaps the correct answer is 4π, and the user intended that. However, given the constraints of the output format, I have to pick A-D. But since there are no choices, I cannot. 

This is a contradiction. However, given the problem as stated, the correct answer is 4π. Assuming that the answer choices might have been omitted, but since the user hasn't provided them, I'll proceed under the assumption that the answer is 4π, and follow the required format. 

But since the output format requires selecting A-D, but there are no choices, perhaps the answer is not among the options. However, the user might have intended for me to ignore the answer choices and provide the answer directly. But the instructions say to select the correct answer choice. 

Given the ambiguity, but following the problem-solving process, the answer is 4π. However, since the user's instructions require ending with Final Answer: A/B/C/D, and there are no choices, perhaps there was an error. In such cases, the safest bet is to assume that the answer is 4π, and since there's no choice, but the system requires a letter, perhaps the answer is not listed. However, the user might have intended for the answer to be 2π, but that's incorrect. 

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the period is 2π. Let me think again. Suppose the horizontal distance between the min and max is π. For example, in the standard sine function, the distance between a min and max is π. But in this case, the distance is 2π. So that would imply the period is 4π. 

Alternatively, maybe the horizontal distance between the min and max is T/2. So T = 2*(distance). Here, distance is 2π, so T = 4π. 

Therefore, the answer is 4π. 

Since I have to choose between A-D, but there are no choices, I'll proceed to write the answer as Final Answer: A, assuming that the correct answer is labeled as A. But this is uncertain. However, since the user hasn't provided answer choices, but the problem originally had some, perhaps the answer is 4π and the correct option is A. But without knowing the options, this is speculative. 

But given the strict instructions, I'll proceed with the answer being 4π and follow the required format. Given that, but unable to select a letter, I'm forced to choose. However, the user might have expected me to use the predicates given. 

Looking back at the predicates: 

Point(A)
Point(B)
Equals(A,Div(-1,2)) → A is -1/2
Mul(A,"pi") → Multiply A by pi, so -π/2
Equals(A,2.4) → So A is -π/2 and equals 2.4? Wait, that can't be. Wait, the predicates are separate. Let me parse them again. 

The user provided several predicates. Let me try to parse them. 

They wrote:

Point(A)
Point(B)
Equals(A,Div(-1,2)) → A equals -1/2
Mul(A,"pi") → Multiply A by pi, so A*pi?
Equals(A,2.4) → A equals 2.4
Equals(B,Div(3,2)) → B equals 3/2
Mul(B,"pi") → Multiply B by pi
Equals(B,13) → B equals 13

Wait, this seems conflicting. How can A be both -1/2 and 2.4? And similarly for B? This suggests that the variables A and B are representing different things. Perhaps A and B are points, but the predicates are assigning numerical values to them. 

Wait, the problem mentions a graph of a trigonometric function with a minimum at (-1/2 π, 2.4) and maximum at (3/2 π, 13). So the x-coordinates are -π/2 and 3π/2, and the y-coordinates are 2.4 and 13. 

The given predicates seem to be trying to assign values to A and B. For example, A is set to Div(-1,2) which is -1/2, then multiplied by pi, giving -π/2. Also, A equals 2.4. Similarly, B is Div(3,2)=3/2, multiplied by pi gives 3π/2, and equals 13. 

Ah! So the x-coordinates of the points are A and B, where A is -π/2 and B is 3π/2. The y-coordinates are 2.4 and 13. 

So the x-coordinates are -π/2 and 3π/2. Thus, the horizontal distance between them is 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 2π. 

As previously determined, this is half the period, so the period is 4π. 

But the problem asks for the period. So the answer is 4π. 

Since the answer choices are not provided, but the user's instructions require selecting A-D, I have to assume that there is an answer choice corresponding to 4π. Without seeing the options, I can't be sure, but based on the calculation, the answer is 4π. Therefore, if the answer options include 4π as option A, then the answer is A. Otherwise, it's unclear. 

Assuming that the answer choices might have had 4π as option A, I'll go with Final Answer: A.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the period of the given trigonometric function, we begin by analyzing the given points:

- Minimum point: $\left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, 2.4\right)$  
- Maximum point: $\left(\frac{3\pi}{2}, 13\right)$  

These coordinates indicate the x-values where the function reaches its minimum and maximum respectively. The key insight is that for a standard sinusoidal function (e.g., $y = A\sin(Bx + C) + D$), the **horizontal distance between a maximum and a minimum corresponds to half the period**. This is because the function transitions from peak to trough over half of its cycle.

---

### Step-by-Step Derivation:

1. **Calculate the horizontal distance between the given points:**  
   $$
   \text{Distance} = \frac{3\pi}{2} - \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{3\pi}{2} + \frac{\pi}{2} = 2\pi
   $$

2. **Relate this distance to the period:**  
   Since the distance is **half the period**, we multiply by 2:
   $$
   \text{Period} = 2 \times 2\pi = 4\pi
   $$

---

### Conclusion:

The period of the function is exactly $4\pi$, and this value aligns precisely with the geometric relationship between the maximum and minimum points.
