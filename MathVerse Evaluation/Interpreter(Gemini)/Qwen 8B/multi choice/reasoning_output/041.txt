MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and understand the setup. 

We have four lines: a, b, c, d. The measures given are angle 1 = 100.0, angle 2 = 100.0, angle 3 = 125.0, and we need to find angle 4. Also, there's a relationship that the sum of measure 3 and measure 4 equals 180.0. Additionally, lines a and b are parallel. 

So, starting with the parallel lines. Since a and b are parallel, maybe there are some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles involved here. But first, let me think about how these angles relate to each other. 

The problem mentions angles 1, 2, 3, and 4. It's likely that these angles are formed by the intersection of lines c and d with lines a and b. Let me visualize this: if lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d are transversals cutting them, creating various angles. 

Given that angles 1 and 2 are both 100 degrees. Maybe they are consecutive interior angles? Wait, but consecutive interior angles would be supplementary if the lines are parallel. However, if two angles are both 100 degrees, their sum would be 200, which isn't 180. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe they're vertical angles or something else. 

Wait, angle 3 is 125 degrees. Then angle 4 plus angle 3 equals 180. So angle 4 would be 180 - 125 = 55 degrees. But wait, the answer options include D as 55. But before jumping to conclusions, I need to check if that's valid. 

But why would angle 3 and angle 4 add up to 180? That suggests they are supplementary. So perhaps angle 3 and angle 4 are adjacent angles forming a linear pair? Or maybe they are same-side interior angles. 

Let me consider the structure again. If lines a and b are parallel, and lines c and d intersect them. Suppose line c intersects line a at angle 1 and line b at angle 2. Similarly, line d intersects line a at angle 3 and line b at angle 4. Wait, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe lines c and d are transversals creating different angles. 

Alternatively, maybe angle 3 and angle 4 are on a straight line, so their sum is 180. For example, if angle 3 is one angle and angle 4 is its supplement. 

But how do angles 1 and 2 come into play? Angles 1 and 2 being 100 degrees each. If lines a and b are parallel, then maybe angles 1 and 2 are corresponding angles, making lines c and d parallel? Wait, but that's not stated. 

Wait, another possibility: since lines a and b are parallel, if a transversal cuts them, then corresponding angles are equal. Suppose angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles. But if they are both 100 degrees, that would mean the transversal creates equal angles. But then where does angle 3 and 4 come in?

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle involved. For instance, if lines c and d form a triangle with lines a and b. But without seeing the diagram, it's tricky. 

But the key equation given is SumOf(MeasureOf(3), MeasureOf(4)) = 180.0. So angle 3 + angle 4 = 180. Given angle 3 is 125, angle 4 would be 55. Which is option D. But I need to verify if this relationship holds based on the geometric configuration. 

Is there a reason why angle 3 and angle 4 would be supplementary? If they are same-side interior angles, then yes. Because if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, same-side interior angles are supplementary. 

So suppose line c is a transversal cutting lines a and b, creating angle 1 and angle 2. Then line d is another transversal, creating angles 3 and 4. Wait, but how would that work? Maybe angle 3 and angle 4 are on the same side of the transversal? 

Alternatively, maybe angles 3 and 4 are on a straight line. For example, if angle 3 is part of a straight line with angle 4, making them supplementary. 

But the problem states that lines a and b are parallel. Let me try to imagine a scenario where angle 3 and angle 4 are same-side interior angles. If line c and line d are two transversals crossing lines a and b. For example, line c crosses a and b, creating angles 1 and 2. Line d crosses a and b, creating angles 3 and 4. But if lines a and b are parallel, then same-side interior angles would be supplementary. 

Suppose angle 3 and angle 4 are same-side interior angles. Then angle 3 + angle 4 = 180. Therefore, angle 4 = 180 - 125 = 55 degrees. So answer D. 

But wait, how do angles 1 and 2 factor in? They are both 100 degrees. Maybe those angles are corresponding or alternate angles. For example, if line c is a transversal, then angle 1 (on line a) corresponds to angle 2 (on line b). Since a and b are parallel, those angles should be equal. Which fits because both are 100 degrees. 

Then, if line d is another transversal, creating angles 3 and 4. If angle 3 is on line a, and angle 4 is on line b, then if they are same-side interior angles, they add up to 180. Hence, angle 4 = 55 degrees. 

Therefore, the answer is D.
