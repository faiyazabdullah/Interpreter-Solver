QUESTION:
Piecewise functions $f$ and $g$ can model the heights (in meters) of two airplanes. $g$ is purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), and $f$ is blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). $t$ is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport. Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection points of the graphs?

CHOICES:
A.They mean that one airplane was initially higher than the other airplane.
B.They mean that the airplanes reached the same height when they were both at 10,000 meters.
C.They give the solutions to the equation $f(t)=0$.
D.They give the solutions to the equation $f(t)=g(t)$.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question involves two piecewise functions f and g representing the heights of airplanes over time t, measured in minutes since noon. The intersection points of these graphs are the focus. The answer choices relate to what these intersections signify.

So, the main goal is to figure out what the intersection points mean in terms of the airplanes' heights. Let me start by recalling that when two functions intersect, their outputs are equal at those points. That means if we have f(t) = g(t) at some t, then at that moment, both airplanes are at the same height. 

Looking at the given data points for each function:

For function g (purple), it passes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000). So, at t=0, height is 10,000m. Then it decreases to 9,000m at t=40, stays there until t=80, then increases again to 11,000m at t=100 and remains there until t=130.

For function f (blue), it goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). So starting at t=10, height is 11,000m. It stays there until t=50, then drops to 10,000m at t=60, remains there until t=100, then plummets to 0m at t=120.

Now, the question is about the intersection points of these two graphs. Since both functions are defined piecewise, their graphs consist of straight line segments between the given points. Each segment represents a linear relationship between time t and height. Therefore, the intersections would occur where the two functions cross each other, which corresponds to times t where their heights are equal.

Let me think about the options given. Option D says the intersections give solutions to f(t) = g(t). That seems directly related because when two functions intersect, their equations are equal at that point. However, I should check the other options to ensure correctness.

Option A claims intersections mean one plane was initially higher. But looking at the initial points: At t=0, g starts at 10,000m. For f, the first point is at t=10, so before that, maybe f isn't defined? Wait, the problem states that t is the number of minutes since noon. The given points for f start at t=10. So at t=0, f hasn't been defined yet. Hence, comparing at t=0 isn't applicable. Therefore, A might not be correct.

Option B suggests intersections mean both planes were at 10,000m. But the functions could intersect at various heights, not necessarily 10,000. For example, looking at the points, g reaches 10,000m at t=0 (but f starts later) and then again at t=60 and t=100 for f. Maybe there's an intersection at 10,000m, but that's just one possibility. The answer B is too specific unless all intersections are at that height, which isn't stated.

Option C says intersections are solutions to f(t)=0. But f(t)=0 occurs when the blue plane is at ground level, which is at t=120. However, the intersection points would involve both functions being equal, not just f(t)=0. So C is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D: intersections correspond to solutions of f(t)=g(t), which means the times when both planes had the same height. This aligns with the definition of function intersections. Even though the functions are piecewise, each segment's intersection would still satisfy f(t)=g(t) at those points. Thus, D is the correct choice.
