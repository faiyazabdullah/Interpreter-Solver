MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question says two rays intersect and form four angles, all measured as x degrees. We need to find x. The answer choices are A:60, B:80, C:90, D:120.

First, I should recall some basic geometry about angles formed by intersecting rays. When two rays intersect, they form two pairs of opposite angles. These opposite angles are equal. Also, adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning they add up to 180 degrees. Wait, but here it says all four angles are equal? That seems like they must each be 90 degrees because if two lines intersect perpendicularly, all angles are right angles. But maybe there's more to it here.

Wait, the problem states that all four angles are x degrees. Let me think. If two lines cross, they make vertical angles, which are equal. But if all four angles are equal, then each pair of vertical angles would have to be equal. But if all four angles are the same measure, then each angle must be half of 180? No, wait. Because around a point, the total sum of angles is 360 degrees. So if there are four angles, each being x, then 4x = 360. Therefore, x would be 90 degrees. That makes sense. 

But let me check again. Suppose two lines intersect, forming four angles. Each angle is x. Since vertical angles are equal, so angles across from each other are equal. So if all four angles are equal, then each one must be 360 divided by 4, which is 90. So x=90. Which is choice C. 

Looking at the given predicates, there are several statements. For example, MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals MeasureOf(Angle(2)), and similarly for others. Then, Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)),90) and others. Also, SumOf all four measures equals 360. So combining these, since all four angles are equal, their sum is 4x = 360, so x=90. So the answer should be C. 

Let me verify once more. If two rays intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. If all four angles are equal, then each must be 90 degrees. Hence, x=90. The answer is C.
