QUESTION:
Mio bought a tablet and pays monthly for internet service for it. She graphed the relationship between the number of months she has had the tablet and the total amount she has spent on it. x-axis labels "Time (months)", and y-axis labels "Total cost (dollars)"
What does the y-intercept represent in this context?
Choose 1 answer:

CHOICES:
A:The number of months after which the total cost is 0 dollars.
B:The cost of buying the tablet
C:The cost per month of internet service
D:None of the above

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Mio graphed the relationship between the number of months she's had the tablet and the total cost. The x-axis is time in months, and the y-axis is total cost in dollars. The question is about what the y-intercept represents here.

First, I need to recall what a y-intercept means in a graph. The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. In the context of a graph showing cost over time, the y-axis is total cost, and the x-axis is time. So, when time is zero, what's the total cost? That's the y-intercept.

Now, looking at the answer choices. Option A says it's the number of months after which total cost is $0. Wait, that sounds like the x-intercept, not the y-intercept. Because the x-intercept would be when cost is zero, so time (months) would be the value there. But the y-intercept is when time is zero, so months = 0. 

Option B is the cost of buying the tablet. That makes sense because if you think about it, when time is zero (no months passed), the total cost should be the initial cost, which is the price of the tablet itself. So that's the fixed cost before any months have passed. 

Option C is the cost per month. That would be the slope of the line, right? Because the slope represents the rate of change, which in this case is the monthly cost. So the y-intercept isn't the rate but the starting point.

So putting it together, the y-intercept is the total cost when time is zero, which is the initial cost. Therefore, the answer should be B: The cost of buying the tablet.
