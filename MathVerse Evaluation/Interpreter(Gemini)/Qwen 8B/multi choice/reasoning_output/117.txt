MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about making a cone from a sector of paper with a central angle of 120 degrees and radius 3. Then we need to find the height of the cone. The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall how sectors become cones. When you roll a sector into a cone, the radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. Also, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let me jot down the given information:

Given:
- Sector with central angle 120° and radius 3. So OA and OB are radii of the sector, each 3 units long.
- When rolled into a cone, the slant height (l) of the cone is equal to the radius of the sector, which is 3. So l = 3.
- The circumference of the base of the cone comes from the arc length of the sector. The original sector has a central angle θ = 120°, so its arc length is (θ/360) * 2πr. Plugging in θ=120 and r=3, that gives (120/360)*2π*3 = (1/3)*6π = 2π. Therefore, the circumference of the base of the cone is 2π. 

Now, if the circumference of the base of the cone is 2π, then the radius (let's call it r_cone) of the base of the cone can be found using the formula C = 2πr_cone. Solving for r_cone: r_cone = C/(2π) = 2π/(2π) = 1. So the base radius of the cone is 1 unit.

Next, we need to find the height (h) of the cone. Since we know the slant height (l = 3) and the base radius (r_cone = 1), we can use the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles. In a right circular cone, the slant height, radius, and height form a right triangle. So:

l² = r_cone² + h²  
Plugging in the numbers:  
3² = 1² + h²  
9 = 1 + h²  
h² = 9 - 1 = 8  
Therefore, h = √8 = 2√2. 

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, option B is 2√2 cm. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, verifying the arc length calculation: 120 degrees is a third of a full circle (360). So the arc length is indeed (1/3)(2π*3) = 2π. That part seems right. Then circumference of the base is 2πr_cone = 2π → r_cone = 1. Correct.

Then using Pythagoras: slant height squared equals radius squared plus height squared. So 3^2 = 1^2 + h^2 → 9 -1 = 8 → h = sqrt(8) = 2√2. Yes, that's correct. So the height is 2√2 cm, which corresponds to option B.

But wait, let me check again. The problem mentions that the cone is made from the sector. Are there any other factors? For example, does the fact that the original sector's radius becomes the slant height hold true here? Yes, because when you roll the sector into a cone, the radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. So that part is correct.

Another thing to consider: Is there any mention of the altitude of the cone being perpendicular to the base? The problem states that the altitude is perpendicular to the base, which is standard for a right circular cone. So our assumption of using the Pythagorean theorem holds.

So all steps seem correct. Hence, the height should be 2√2 cm, which is option B.
