MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a circle O with AB as the diameter. Points C and D are on the circle too since CD is a chord. Also, there are several other points mentioned like A, B, C, D, O. The question gives us that angle ADC is 26 degrees, and asks for the measure of angle CAB. 

First, I need to recall some circle theorems. Since AB is the diameter, any angle subtended by AB on the circumference should be a right angle. Wait, that's Thales' theorem. So if there's a triangle inscribed in a semicircle, it's a right triangle. But here, maybe point C or D is involved? Let me check the given predicates again.

We have Line(A,B) as the diameter of the circle. Then, PointLiesOnCircle(A,O), same for B, C, D. So all these points lie on the circle. Also, Lines AC, BC, AD, CD are chords. And angle ADC is 26 degrees. We need angle CAB. 

Let me visualize the diagram. AB is the diameter. Let's assume the circle has center O. Points C and D are somewhere on the circumference. Line CD is a chord, so connecting C and D. Angle at D, angle ADC, which is formed by points A-D-C. So vertex at D, with sides DA and DC. Given that angle is 26 degrees. Need to find angle CAB, which is the angle at point A between CA and AB.

Hmm. Maybe I can use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or inscribed angles. Since all points are on the circle, ABCD might form a cyclic quadrilateral. Wait, but AB is the diameter. Let me think about the arcs. 

Since AB is a diameter, arc AB measures 180 degrees. The angle ADC is an inscribed angle. Inscribed angle theorem says that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle ADC intercepts arc AC. Because angle at D, so the arc opposite would be arc AC. Therefore, measure of angle ADC is half of arc AC. So arc AC is 2*26=52 degrees. 

Wait, but angle ADC is formed by points A-D-C. So the inscribed angle at D intercepts arc AC. Yes, because the angle is formed by chords DA and DC, so the intercepted arc is AC. Therefore, arc AC is 52 degrees. 

Now, angle CAB is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CB. Because angle CAB is at point A, between CA and AB. So the intercepted arc would be arc CB. Wait, how does that work? Let me think again. 

Inscribed angle at A, formed by points C-A-B. So the intercepted arc is arc CB. Because the angle is between CA and AB, so the arc opposite is CB. Therefore, the measure of angle CAB is half of arc CB. 

So if I can find the measure of arc CB, then divide by two to get angle CAB. 

But how do I find arc CB? Well, since AB is the diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. Arc AC is 52 degrees, as found earlier. So arc AB is composed of arc AC plus arc CB. Wait, but depending on where point C is located. If points are arranged such that moving from A to B along the circle passes through C, then arc AB would be arc AC + arc CB. But since AB is the diameter, the total arc from A to B is 180 degrees. 

So if arc AC is 52 degrees, then arc CB would be 180 - 52 = 128 degrees. Therefore, angle CAB, being half of arc CB, would be 128 / 2 = 64 degrees. 

Wait, but wait—could there be another way? Let me verify. Another approach: consider triangle ADC. Since AB is the diameter, and D is a point on the circle. Maybe there's a relationship between angles here. Alternatively, since AB is the diameter, and O is the center, OA and OB are radii. 

Alternatively, since angle ADC is 26 degrees, and AB is the diameter, perhaps triangle ADC relates to some right triangles. For example, if we connect OD, since O is the center, but I'm not sure yet. 

Another thought: since AB is the diameter, and C is a point on the circle, then triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C. Wait, yes! By Thales' theorem, any triangle inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle. So triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Therefore, angle ACB is 90 degrees. 

But how does that help? Let's see. In triangle ABC, angle at C is 90 degrees. Then, angle CAB + angle ABC = 90 degrees. But how to relate that to angle ADC?

Alternatively, considering quadrilateral ABCD. Since all points lie on the circle, ABCD is cyclic. Therefore, opposite angles sum to 180 degrees. Wait, but angle ADC is 26 degrees. What's the opposite angle? It would be angle ABC. Wait, in cyclic quadrilaterals, opposite angles are supplementary. But angle ADC and angle ABC are not necessarily opposite unless the quadrilateral is ordered properly. 

Wait, the order of the quadrilateral matters. Let me think about the arrangement. Points A and B are endpoints of the diameter. Points C and D are other points on the circle. Let's imagine the circle with AB horizontal, A on left, B on right. Suppose D is somewhere above the diameter AB, and C is another point. 

But without knowing the exact positions, it's hard to say. However, since angle ADC is given, which is at D. So if D is on one side, and C is on the other. But maybe I need to consider the arcs again. 

Earlier conclusion was that arc AC is 52 degrees, leading to arc CB being 128 degrees, making angle CAB 64 degrees. That would correspond to answer choice C. But let me check again.

Wait, angle ADC intercepts arc AC. So that's correct. Then arc AC is 52 degrees. Then arc CB is arc AB minus arc AC. Since AB is 180 degrees, arc CB is 180 - 52 = 128 degrees. Then angle CAB is half of arc CB, which is 64 degrees. So answer C: 64 degrees. 

But wait, let me make sure that angle CAB indeed intercepts arc CB. When you have an inscribed angle at point A, between CA and AB, the intercepted arc is from C to B, passing through the opposite side of the circle. So yes, arc CB. Therefore, angle CAB = ½ arc CB. 

Therefore, 128 / 2 = 64 degrees. So the answer should be C. 

Alternatively, could there be a mistake here? Let me think again. Suppose arc AC is 52 degrees. Then, since AB is 180 degrees, the rest of the arc from C to B is 128 degrees. But is there another arc from C to B? Depending on direction. But since AB is the diameter, the major arc CB would be more than 180 degrees, but since we're dealing with inscribed angles, they always refer to the minor arc unless specified otherwise. Wait, but in this case, since AB is the diameter, and points C and D are on the circle, the position of C affects whether arc CB is minor or major. 

Wait, if arc AC is 52 degrees, then depending on where C is placed. Let's assume that moving from A to B along the circle, passing through C. Then arc AC is part of the semicircle AB. So arc AC is 52 degrees, arc CB is 180 - 52 = 128 degrees. Thus, angle CAB is half of arc CB, which is 64 degrees. 

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is C: 64 degrees. Which is option C. So the correct answer is C.
