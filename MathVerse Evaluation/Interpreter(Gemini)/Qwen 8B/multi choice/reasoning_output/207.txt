====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question is about finding the area of the shaded region when two smaller circles are inscribed in the biggest circle, and the diameter of the biggest circle is 20. The answer choices are given, so I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me start by breaking down the information given.

First, the problem mentions three circles: Circle(1), Circle(2), and Circle(3). From the predicates, it says that Circle(2) and Circle(3) are inscribed in Circle(1). Also, Circle(2) and Circle(3) are congruent. The diameter of the biggest circle, which I assume is Circle(1), is 20 units. The shaded region probably refers to the area inside Circle(1) but outside the two smaller circles, since they're inscribed. But I need to confirm that assumption.

Let me recall some circle properties. When a circle is inscribed in another circle, there are different ways they can be positioned. However, typically, if two circles are inscribed within a larger circle, they might be arranged such that each touches the center of the larger circle and each other? Or maybe they are placed side by side? Wait, but since they are congruent and inscribed, perhaps they are tangent to each other and also tangent to the larger circle?

Alternatively, maybe they are arranged such that their centers lie along a straight line passing through the center of the big circle. For example, if two congruent circles are inscribed in a bigger circle, they could be placed symmetrically on either side of the center. But how does that affect their radii?

Wait, the diameter of the largest circle is 20, so its radius is 10. Now, if there are two smaller circles inscribed in it, their sizes depend on how they are arranged. Since they are congruent, their radii would be the same. Let me think about how to find their radii.

Assuming that the two smaller circles are placed such that each touches the larger circle and each other. In that case, the distance from the center of the large circle to the center of each small circle would be R - r, where R is the radius of the large circle and r is the radius of the small ones. But since there are two small circles, their centers would be separated by twice the radius of the small circles? Or wait, the distance between the centers of the two small circles would be 2r, because each has radius r and they touch each other. But the centers of the small circles are located at a distance of R - r from the center of the large circle. Let me visualize this.

Imagine the big circle with radius 10. Two small circles inside, each touching the big circle and each other. Their centers are aligned with the center of the big circle. So the distance from the big circle's center to each small circle's center is R - r. The distance between the two small centers would be 2*(R - r) if they are on opposite sides. Wait, no—if they are on opposite sides, the distance between them would be 2(R - r). But since they also touch each other, that distance should be equal to 2r. Therefore:

2(R - r) = 2r → R - r = r → R = 2r → r = R/2.

But R is 10, so r would be 5. Then the radius of each small circle is 5. Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again.

Wait, if two small circles are each touching the big circle and each other, their centers are aligned with the center of the big circle. The distance between the centers of the two small circles would be the sum of their radii, but since they are congruent, it's 2r. However, the distance between their centers is also the distance from the big circle's center to the first small center plus the distance from the big circle's center to the second small center. If they are on opposite ends, that total distance would be (R - r) + (R - r) = 2(R - r). This equals 2r. So:

2(R - r) = 2r  
=> R - r = r  
=> R = 2r  
=> r = R / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5.

So each small circle has radius 5. Therefore, the area of the big circle is πR² = π*10² = 100π. The area of each small circle is πr² = π*5² = 25π. There are two small circles, so total area of small circles is 2*25π = 50π. Thus, the shaded area (assuming it's the big circle minus the small ones) would be 100π - 50π = 50π ≈ 157.08. Looking at the options, that's close to option B: 157.1. So maybe the answer is B.

But wait, maybe the arrangement isn't like that. What if the two small circles are not overlapping and each is tangent to the big circle but not necessarily to each other? Then their radii could be different. But the problem states that they are congruent, so they have the same radius. Alternatively, maybe they are arranged such that each is tangent to the big circle and to the other small circle. Which brings us back to the previous scenario. 

Another possibility: the two small circles are inscribed in the big circle such that each is tangent to the big circle and to the other small circle. That's the case we considered earlier. Hence, leading to radius 5 each. Then shaded area would be 100π - 50π = 50π ≈ 157.08, which rounds to 157.1. So option B.

But let me double-check. Suppose instead the small circles are arranged differently. For example, if they are both tangent to the big circle and to each other, but not diametrically opposed. Wait, but if they are congruent and both tangent to the big circle and each other, their centers would form an equilateral triangle with the big circle's center. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Suppose the two small circles are placed such that their centers are both at a distance of R - r from the big circle's center. The distance between the centers of the two small circles would be sqrt[(distance from big center to small1)^2 + (distance from big center to small2)^2 - 2*(distance from big center to small1)*(distance from big center to small2)*cos(theta)], where theta is the angle between the two lines connecting the big center to the small centers. But if the two small circles are placed symmetrically, say, forming an angle θ apart. However, since they are also tangent to each other, the distance between their centers is 2r. So:

sqrt[ (R - r)^2 + (R - r)^2 - 2*(R - r)^2*cosθ ] = 2r

But unless θ is 180 degrees (opposite sides), this becomes more complicated. However, if θ is 180°, then cosθ = -1, and the equation simplifies to:

sqrt[ 2(R - r)^2 + 2(R - r)^2 ] = sqrt[ 4(R - r)^2 ] = 2(R - r) = 2r ⇒ R - r = r ⇒ R=2r ⇒ r=R/2. Which gives the same result as before.

Therefore, regardless of the angle, if the two small circles are congruent and each tangent to the big circle and each other, their radius must be half of the big circle's radius. Therefore, radius of small circles is 5. Hence, the shaded area is 100π - 2*(25π) = 50π ≈ 157.08, which rounds to 157.1, matching option B.

But wait, the problem mentions "two small circles are inscribed to the biggest circle". Maybe the term "inscribed" here means something else. Sometimes, inscribing a circle in another can mean that it's tangent to the circumference, but depending on the configuration. Another thought: maybe the two small circles are inscribed such that they are each tangent to the big circle and to each other, but not necessarily centered along the same axis. However, even then, the calculation would still hold because of symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the two small circles are inscribed in the sense that they are each inscribed in the big circle, meaning that they are entirely within it, but not necessarily tangent. But since they are congruent and inscribed, perhaps they are placed in such a way that they don't overlap. However, without knowing their exact placement, it's hard to calculate their radii. But the problem gives us that they are congruent and inscribed, and that there's a diameter of the big circle given. So, likely, the intended interpretation is that the two small circles are tangent to the big circle and each other, hence leading to the radius being 5 each.

Thus, the shaded area would be the area of the big circle minus the areas of the two small circles. Calculating that:

Area_big = π*(10)^2 = 100π

Area_small = π*(5)^2 = 25π per small circle, so two of them: 50π

Subtracting: 100π - 50π = 50π ≈ 157.08, which rounds to 157.1. So option B.

Looking at the answer choices, B is 157.1. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.
