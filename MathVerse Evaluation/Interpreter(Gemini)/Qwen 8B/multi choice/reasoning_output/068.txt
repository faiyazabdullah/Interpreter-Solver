====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have two kids, Xuan Xuan and Kai Kai, who made some jigsaw puzzles using squares with side length 12.0. The question is asking for the sum of the areas of three circled figures in the picture. But since there's no picture, I need to rely on the given predicates and the answer choices.

First, I'll go through the given predicates. There's a square ABCD with sides AB, BC, CD, DA each of length 12.0. The area of the square is 144.0, which makes sense because area of a square is side squared, so 12^2=144. Also, all angles are right angles, confirming it's a square.

Then there are other shapes mentioned: Shape(1) to Shape(7). Specifically, Triangle(1), Triangle(2), Triangle(3), Triangle(4), Square(6), Parallelogram(7). Wait, but how do these relate to the problem? The question mentions three figures circled in the figure, but without seeing the image, maybe the figures refer to parts of the square divided in some way?

Since the original square has area 144, if the three circled figures are parts of this square, maybe they're regions formed by dividing the square into different shapes. Let me think about common ways to divide a square into smaller shapes for jigsaw puzzles. Common divisions could involve diagonals, midlines, or creating triangles and parallelograms.

But the answer choices are 12, 24, 36, 48 cmÂ². Since the total area of the square is 144, the sum of the three figures would be less than 144. The options are all multiples of 12. Let me consider possibilities.

If the three figures are three equal parts of the square, each part would be 48 (since 144 / 3 = 48). That would correspond to option D. Alternatively, if they are half of the square, maybe 72, but that's not among the options. Or perhaps overlapping areas?

Wait, another thought: sometimes jigsaw puzzles involve cutting the square into pieces and rearranging them. For example, if they cut the square into four triangles by drawing both diagonals, each triangle would have area 36 (since 144/4=36). But the question says three figures. Maybe two triangles and a parallelogram? Or something like that.

Alternatively, if they divide the square into a triangle, a rectangle, and another shape. Let's suppose that the three circled figures are three regions whose areas add up to a certain value. Without the image, it's tricky, but maybe we can infer from the given predicates.

Looking at the predicates again, there are also Shape(1) to Shape(7), including Triangles and Parallelogram. Perhaps the three circled figures are three of those shapes. But how?

Another angle: the problem mentions that they used a square of side 12 to make a pair of jigsaw puzzles. Maybe each puzzle is a different division of the square. If the three figures are parts from combining both puzzles, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the three figures are three triangles formed by connecting points. For instance, if they draw lines from corners to midpoints or something similar.

Let me think about possible areas. Suppose the square is divided into a triangle with base 12 and height 12, which would give area 72. Then another triangle with area 36, and another with 36. Their sum would be 144, which is the whole square. Not matching the options.

Wait, the answer choices are 12, 24, 36, 48. These are all factors of 144. Let me check if there's a standard division where three regions add up to one of these numbers.

For example, if the square is split into a triangle with area 48, another with 48, and another with 48, but that would be 144. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if they took half of the square (72) and then split it further. But again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the three figures are three-quarters of the square. But 144*(3/4)=108, not an option.

Hmm. Another possibility: the square is divided into a parallelogram and two triangles. For example, if you take a parallelogram with base 12 and height 6, its area would be 72. Then two triangles each with area 36, totaling 72+36+36=144. Still not matching the options.

Alternatively, if each figure is a triangle with area 24. Three of them would be 72. Not in options. Wait, the answer options are 12,24,36,48. So maybe each figure is 12, 24, 36, or 48. 

Wait, the problem says "the sum of the area of the three figures". So if each figure is a triangle with area 24, then sum would be 72. Not in options. But if two of them are 24 and one is 12, sum is 56. Not helpful.

Alternatively, think of the square being divided into four smaller squares, each of 36 area (since 12x12 divided into four 6x6 squares). If three of them are selected, sum is 108. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps the three figures are parts created by folding or cutting. For example, if you fold a square along its diagonal, making two triangles. Each triangle has area 72. But again, not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the three figures are three rectangles. If each has dimensions 12x4, area 48 each. Sum would be 144. Not helpful.

Alternatively, think of the square divided into a rectangle and two triangles. For example, if you divide the square vertically into a rectangle of width 6 and height 12, area 72, and then two triangles each with area 36. Total sum of the three figures (rectangle + two triangles) would be 72+36+36=144. Again, not matching.

Wait, maybe the three figures are not all within the square. But the problem states they used a square piece of paper, so likely all figures are parts of the square.

Alternatively, think of the square being divided into three parts by lines that create regions with specific areas. For example, if you draw a line from one corner to a point along the opposite side, creating a triangle and a trapezoid. But calculating their areas would require knowing where the point is.

But without more info, this is guesswork. However, looking at the answer options, 48 is a plausible number. Because 48 is half of 96, but not sure.

Wait, another approach: the square has area 144. The answer options are all fractions of that. Let me see:

Option D is 48, which is exactly 1/3 of the square's area. If the three figures together make up exactly one-third of the square, that would be 48. But why would that be the case? Maybe the three figures are each 16, but that's not an option. Or maybe they are arranged such that their combined area is 48.

Alternatively, if each figure is 16, but again, not in options.

Wait, perhaps the three figures are three triangles, each with area 16, but 16 isn't in the options. Hmm.

Wait, the answer choices are in cm. But the given square has side length 12.0 cm. So units are consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the three figures are three small squares each with side length 4 cm. Area would be 16 each, sum 48. Which is option D. But how does that fit?

If the original square is 12x12, dividing it into nine small squares of 4x4 each, each with area 16. Taking three of them gives 48. That would be option D. But the problem says they made a pair of jigsaw puzzles. Maybe each puzzle is made by dividing the square into four parts, and the three circled figures are parts from both puzzles? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the three figures are three quarters of the square. Wait, 144 * 3/4 is 108, not in options.

Alternatively, maybe the three figures are three right triangles, each with legs of 12 and 6. Area would be (12*6)/2=36 each. Sum of three would be 108. Not an option.

Wait, but the answer options don't have 108. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Another thought: if the square is divided into a triangle, a parallelogram, and another shape. For example, if you draw a line from one corner to a midpoint, forming a triangle and a pentagon. But again, without specifics, hard to tell.

Wait, the problem mentions that they made a pair of jigsaw puzzles. Jigsaw puzzles often involve dividing a shape into several pieces that fit together. If they made two puzzles, each from the same square, maybe each puzzle uses different divisions. For example, one puzzle might have three pieces, and the other has three, but the question refers to three figures in the combined work.

But I'm stuck. Let me look back at the answer choices. The options are 12,24,36,48. All multiples of 12. Given that the square's area is 144, which is 12^2, the sum of the three figures must be a fraction of that.

If the answer is 48, that's exactly a third of the square. If the three figures are each 16, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe the three figures are each 16, but not. Wait, but 48 is a possible answer.

Alternatively, think of the square divided into a triangle with area 48 and two other shapes. Like, if you divide the square into a triangle and a pentagon, but again, not sure.

Wait, here's another idea. If the square is divided into a larger triangle and two smaller ones. For example, imagine drawing a line from one corner to a point on the opposite side, creating a triangle and a quadrilateral. Suppose the triangle has area 48, and then the remaining area is 96. If the other two figures are each 24, then the sum would be 48+24+24=96. Not matching.

Alternatively, if the three figures are each 24, sum is 72. Not in options. Or 12 each, sum 36. Option C.

But without seeing the image, it's really challenging. However, considering that the answer choices are 12,24,36,48, and the square's area is 144, the most probable answer is 48, which is exactly one-third of the square. This might be if each figure is a quarter of the square, but three quarters would be 108. No.

Alternatively, if the three figures are three of the four triangles formed by the diagonals. Each triangle would be 72. But three of them would be 216, which is impossible.

Wait, maybe the three figures are three rectangles each with area 16. But again, not matching.

Wait, let me think differently. The given predicates mention various shapes like Triangle(1), Triangle(2), Triangle(3), Triangle(4), Square(6), Parallelogram(7). Maybe the three circled figures are three of these. For example, if each triangle has area 24, then sum would be 72. But again, not matching.

Alternatively, if the three figures are the square (area 144) and two others... but the question says three figures. Wait, the problem says "three figures circled in the figure." If the figure includes the square and other shapes, but the answer is the sum of the three circled ones. Since the square's area is 144, but the options are much smaller, maybe the circled figures are parts of it.

Perhaps the answer is 48, which is option D. I think that's the most plausible, even though I can't be 100% sure without the image. Considering that 48 is a clean number and a factor of 144, I'll go with that.
