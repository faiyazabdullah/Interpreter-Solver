C:$f$ and $g$ share the same minimum.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to compare the minimum values of two functions, f(x) and g(x). The question is asking which one has a greater minimum. Let me start by recalling what I know about quadratic functions.

First, the function f(x) is given as f(x) = 4(x - 5)^2 + 2. Since it's in vertex form, which is generally written as f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k, the vertex of this parabola is at (h, k). In this case, h is 5 and k is 2. Therefore, the vertex of f(x) is at (5, 2). Because the coefficient 'a' here is positive (4), the parabola opens upwards, so the vertex represents the minimum point. Thus, the minimum value of f(x) is 2.

Now, we need to find the minimum value of g(x). The problem states that g(x) is a quadratic function passing through the points (0,7), (-4,7), and having its vertex at (-2,3). Wait, since it's a quadratic function, it's a parabola. The vertex form is again helpful here. 

Given that the vertex is at (-2, 3), the equation of g(x) should be in the form g(x) = a(x + 2)^2 + 3. Now, we need to find the value of 'a'. To do that, we can use one of the other points provided. Let's take the point (0,7). Plugging x=0 into the equation:

7 = a(0 + 2)^2 + 3  
7 = a*(4) + 3  
Subtract 3 from both sides: 4 = 4a  
So, a = 1.

Wait, but let me check if that works with another point. Let's test the point (-4,7). Plugging x=-4 into the equation:

g(-4) = a(-4 + 2)^2 + 3  
Which is a*(-2)^2 + 3 = 4a + 3. We know that this equals 7, so 4a + 3 =7 → 4a=4 → a=1. Yep, that checks out. So the equation for g(x) is g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 3. 

Now, since the coefficient 'a' here is 1, which is positive, the parabola opens upwards, so the vertex at (-2, 3) is indeed the minimum point. Therefore, the minimum value of g(x) is 3.

Comparing the minimums of f(x) and g(x): f(x)'s minimum is 2, and g(x)'s is 3. So, g(x) has a greater minimum than f(x). Therefore, the correct answer should be B: g has a greater minimum than f.

Let me just make sure there are no mistakes here. For f(x), vertex at (5,2) gives min 2. For g(x), vertex at (-2,3) gives min 3. Yes, that seems right. So the answer is B.
