MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle O with radius 1.0, and there's a tangent line AB touching the circle at point A. Also, angle OBA is 30 degrees. We need to find the length of OB. 

First, I should recall some geometry concepts. Since AB is tangent to the circle at A, the radius OA should be perpendicular to AB. That means OA is perpendicular to AB. Wait, the problem mentions that Line(O,A) is a radius, so OA is a radius of the circle. And since AB is tangent at A, OA is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, angle OAB is 90 degrees. But wait, the problem says angle OBA is 30 degrees. Let me visualize this. 

So, points O, A, and B form a triangle. Let me sketch mentally: O is the center of the circle, A is a point on the circle where the tangent AB touches. Then, AB is tangent at A, so OA is perpendicular to AB. Therefore, triangle OAB has a right angle at A. Wait, but angle OBA is given as 30 degrees. So in triangle OAB, angle at A is 90 degrees, angle at B is 30 degrees. Therefore, angle at O would be 60 degrees because angles sum to 180. 

In such a triangle, sides relate via trigonometric ratios. Since OA is the radius, which is 1.0 units. In triangle OAB, OA is opposite to angle B (which is 30 degrees). Wait, no. Let me clarify the triangle. Triangle OAB: right-angled at A. So OA is one leg, AB is another leg, and OB is the hypotenuse. Wait, no. Wait, OA is the radius, which is perpendicular to AB. So OA is perpendicular to AB. So OA is one leg, AB is the other leg, and OB is the hypotenuse? Wait, no. Because OA is connected to O and A, and AB connects A to B. So O is the center, A is the point of tangency, and B is outside the circle. So triangle OAB has OA as a leg (radius), AB as another leg (tangent segment), and OB as the hypotenuse. 

But angle at B is 30 degrees. In triangle OAB, angle at B is 30 degrees, right angle at A. So the angles are 90° at A, 30° at B, so angle at O is 60°. Now, using trigonometry. In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is opposite over hypotenuse. For angle B (30°), the opposite side is OA, which is 1.0. So sin(30°) = OA / OB. Therefore, 1/2 = 1/OB → OB = 2. 

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. In triangle OAB, right-angled at A. Angle at B is 30°, so OA is opposite to angle B. So OA = 1.0. Therefore, sin(angle B) = OA / OB → sin(30°) = 1 / OB → 1/2 = 1/OB → OB = 2. So the length of OB is 2. Which corresponds to answer choice B. 

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the cosine of angle B. Wait, angle at B is 30°, adjacent side is AB, hypotenuse OB. But OA is opposite to angle B. So yes, sin(30°) = opposite/hypotenuse = OA/OB. So that gives OB = OA / sin(30°) = 1 / 0.5 = 2. So yes, answer B. 

Another way: Since it's a right triangle with angles 30-60-90, the sides are in ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Here, OA (opposite 30°) is 1, so hypotenuse OB is twice that, so 2. Hence, answer B. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be B.
