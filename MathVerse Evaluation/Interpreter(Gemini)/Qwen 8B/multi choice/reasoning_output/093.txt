Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C all on circle O. The question is about finding the measure of angle A, given that angle OBC is 40 degrees. Let me start by recalling the given predicates and see how they connect.

First, since all three points A, B, C lie on circle O, that means they're all on the circumference. Also, O is the center because there are lines OA, OB, OC which are radii. The predicates mention that OA, OB, OC are radii, so their lengths are equal. That tells me triangle OBC is an isosceles triangle because OB and OC are radii, hence OB = OC. Wait, but the problem says Triangle(O,B,C) is isosceles, which aligns with that.

Given that angle OBC is 40 degrees. Since triangle OBC is isosceles with OB = OC, the base angles at B and C should be equal. Wait, but angle OBC is one of those base angles. Wait, hold on. In triangle OBC, sides OB and OC are equal, so the angles opposite them would be equal. But wait, angle at B is angle OBC, and angle at C would be angle OCB. Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.

Let me draw triangle OBC. Points O is the center, B and C are on the circle. So OB and OC are radii, so OB=OC. Therefore, triangle OBC is isosceles with legs OB and OC. Therefore, the base angles at B and C are equal. Wait, but angle OBC is at point B, between points O and C. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, in triangle OBC, vertices are O, B, C. So the sides are OB, BC, and OC. Since OB and OC are equal, the triangle has two equal sides: OB and OC. Therefore, the base is BC, and the two equal sides are OB and OC. Hence, the base angles are at B and C. Wait, but angle OBC is the angle at vertex B, which is adjacent to side OB and BC. So angle OBC is one of the base angles. Similarly, angle OCB is the other base angle. Therefore, these two angles should be equal. However, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(O,B,C)) is 40 degrees. Wait, Angle(O,B,C) is angle at B, between O and C. So that's angle OBC, which is given as 40 degrees. Then angle OCB should also be 40 degrees. 

So, in triangle OBC, angles at B and C are each 40 degrees. Then the third angle at O would be 180 - 40 - 40 = 100 degrees. So angle BOC is 100 degrees. Now, since O is the center of the circle, angle BOC is a central angle corresponding to arc BC. The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Therefore, arc BC measures 100 degrees.

Now, moving to the main question: angle A. The problem mentions that triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O. So, ABC is a triangle inscribed in the circle with O as the center. Wait, but points A, B, C are on the circle, so ABC is a triangle inscribed in the circle. Therefore, angle A is an inscribed angle. Wait, but angle A refers to angle BAC? Or angle at point A? Wait, in standard notation, angle A would be the angle at vertex A, which is angle BAC. 

But inscribed angles relate to arcs. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if we can find the arc that angle A intercepts, then we can find its measure.

But first, we need to know which arc angle A intercepts. In triangle ABC, angle at A intercepts arc BC. Because in an inscribed triangle, each angle intercepts the arc opposite it. So angle A intercepts arc BC. Earlier, we found that arc BC is 100 degrees. Therefore, angle A (which is angle BAC) would be half of that, so 100 / 2 = 50 degrees. 

Wait, but wait. Is there anything else to consider? For example, could there be another arc involved? Let me confirm. In a circle, an inscribed angle formed by points A, B, C intercepts the arc that is opposite the angle. So yes, angle at A intercepts arc BC. Since arc BC is 100 degrees, then angle A is half of that, 50 degrees. Therefore, the answer would be 50°, which corresponds to option A.

But let me check again. Another way to look at it: since angle BOC is 100 degrees, which is the central angle over arc BC. The inscribed angle over the same arc BC would be half, so 50 degrees. Therefore, angle at A is 50 degrees. So the answer is A: 50°.

Alternatively, maybe there's something about triangle ABC being inscribed and other angles? Wait, but all the given info seems consistent. Let me make sure there isn't a different configuration. For instance, perhaps angle A is referring to some other angle? No, the problem says angle A, so in standard terms, that's angle BAC. And since points A, B, C are on the circle, angle BAC is indeed an inscribed angle over arc BC. So the calculation holds.

Therefore, the answer should be 50°, option A.
