MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the first maximum point of the function y = cos(x + 45°) for x ≥ 0. The original cosine function y = cos(x) has its first maximum at (0°, 1). Now, we need to consider how the transformation affects this maximum point.

First, I remember that transformations of trigonometric functions involve shifts, reflections, stretches, or compressions. In this case, the function is y = cos(x + 45°). This looks like a horizontal shift. Specifically, adding a positive value inside the cosine function causes a shift to the left. Wait, let me think again. For a general function y = cos(Bx - C) + D, the phase shift is C/B. But here, it's cos(x + 45°), which can be written as cos(x - (-45°)), so the phase shift would be -45°, meaning the graph is shifted to the left by 45° units. 

So, if the original maximum of y = cos(x) occurs at x = 0°, shifting the graph left by 45° would move that maximum to x = -45°. However, the problem asks for the first maximum point where x ≥ 0. That means we need to find the next maximum after x = 0°, but since the graph was shifted left, maybe there's another maximum within x ≥ 0?

Wait, cosine functions have periodicity. The standard period is 360°, so every 360°, the pattern repeats. The maximum points occur at multiples of 360°, but also considering the phase shift. Let me think more carefully.

Original maxima of cos(x) are at x = 0°, 360°, 720°, etc. But when we shift the graph left by 45°, the new function y = cos(x + 45°) would have its maxima where x + 45° equals 0°, 360°, 720°, etc. Solving for x gives x = -45°, 315°, 675°, etc. So the first maximum after x ≥ 0 would be at x = 315°, because -45° is negative, so the next one is 315°, which is 360° - 45° = 315°. Therefore, the first maximum for x ≥ 0 is at (315°, 1).

But wait, the problem says "the first maximum point for x ≥ 0". Since the original maximum at x=0° is shifted left, the next maximum would be at 315°, which is still within x ≥ 0. So the coordinates would be (315°, 1). 

Alternatively, maybe I should check if there's a maximum between x=0 and x=315. Let me recall that the cosine function decreases from 0° to 180°, reaches minimum at 180°, then increases back to 1 at 360°. So if the function is shifted left by 45°, then the maximum at x=-45° (which is before x=0) would mean that after that, the next maximum would be at x=315°, as mentioned earlier. Because between x=0 and x=315°, the function would go from cos(45°) down to cos(180° + 45°)=cos(225°) which is -√2/2, then up to cos(315°) which is √2/2? Wait, no. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, the function is y = cos(x + 45°). At x=0, the value is cos(45°) ≈ 0.707. Then as x increases, x + 45° goes from 45° upwards. The maximum of the cosine function occurs when x + 45° = 0°, which is x=-45°, then the next maximum would be when x + 45° = 360°, so x = 315°. Between x=0 and x=315°, the function would decrease from cos(45°) to cos(315° + 45°)=cos(360°)=1. Wait, no. Wait, when x=315°, x + 45° = 360°, so cos(360°)=1. So yes, that's a maximum. So the first maximum after x ≥ 0 is at x=315°, which is the first occurrence where x + 45° = 360°, hence x=315°. Therefore, the coordinates would be (315°, 1). 

Therefore, the first maximum point for x ≥ 0 is at (315°, 1). So the answer should be (315°, 1). But looking at the options provided, the user hasn't listed them. Wait, the original question mentions answer choices as No choices found. Wait, perhaps the answer isn't among the choices given? But the user said to select the correct answer choice. However, since the answer choices weren't provided, but according to the instructions, the assistant must choose from A-D. Hmm, but the initial setup didn't list answer choices. Maybe there was an error in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the answer is expected to be expressed in terms of degrees, such as (45°, something)? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem states that the answer choices were not found. But the user wants us to provide the answer as per the process, ending with Final Answer: A/D/C/B. 

Assuming that the answer is (315°, 1), but since the answer choices aren't given, perhaps the intended answer is (45°, ...)? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the transformation.

Another way: the function y = cos(x + 45°) is equivalent to y = cos(x - (-45°)). So the phase shift is -45°, meaning the graph is shifted left by 45°. The original maximum at (0°, 1) moves to (-45°, 1). But we're interested in x ≥ 0. So the next maximum would be when the argument x + 45° equals 360°, leading to x = 315°, as before. Hence, the first maximum point for x ≥ 0 is (315°, 1). Therefore, the coordinates are (315°, 1). 

Since the answer choices weren't provided, but the problem originally had answer choices (though they are not shown here), maybe the correct answer is (315°, 1), which could correspond to option B, C, etc., depending on the actual choices. But without seeing the options, I can't know. However, the problem statement mentions that the answer choices are "No choices found," which suggests that there might be an issue. But assuming that the answer is (315°, 1), and if the options included this, then that would be the answer. Since the user instructed to select the correct answer choice, but the answer choices aren't visible, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the first maximum is at (315°, 1), so the coordinates are (315°, 1). Therefore, if the options include this, it's the answer. Assuming that the correct answer corresponds to option B, for example, but since I don't have the options, I have to make an educated guess. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is (45°, something), but that doesn't fit. 

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check once more. Suppose we have y = cos(x + 45°). The maxima occur where x + 45° = 360°k, k integer. So solving for x gives x = 360°k - 45°. For k=0, x=-45°, which is negative. For k=1, x=360° - 45° = 315°, which is positive. Hence, the first maximum at x≥0 is indeed 315°, y=1. Therefore, the coordinates are (315°, 1). 

Thus, the answer should be (315°, 1). Assuming that the answer choices include this, the correct answer would be whatever option corresponds to this. Since the problem states that the answer choices are "No choices found", but the user requires selecting an option, perhaps there was a formatting error. Given that, I'll conclude that the answer is (315°, 1), which would correspond to option B if, say, the options are ordered as follows: A) (0°,1), B) (45°, something), C) (90°,0), D) (315°,1). But without knowing the exact options, I can't be certain. However, following the logic, the answer must be (315°, 1), so I'll assume that the correct choice is B or D, but since I need to pick one, I'll choose D as a placeholder. However, this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the answer is (45°, something), but that seems incorrect. 

Given that the problem's initial setup includes points like (0,1), (90,0), etc., perhaps the answer expects degrees in the coordinate system. So the correct coordinates are (315°, 1), which would likely be option D if the choices are in order. So I'll go with Final Answer: D.
