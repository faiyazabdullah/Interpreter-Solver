====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a pentagon UVWYZ, and we need to find the measure of angle W, which is given as x + 8 degrees. The question asks for m∠W, so essentially, we need to find the value of x first and then compute x + 8.

First, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is always (n-2)*180 degrees, where n is the number of sides. Since it's a pentagon, n=5, so the total should be (5-2)*180 = 3*180 = 540 degrees. That means all the angles inside the pentagon add up to 540 degrees.

Now, looking at the given predicates, each angle is expressed in terms of x. Let me list them out again:

- MeasureOf(Angle(V,U,Z), x-8) → This is ∠VUZ, which is x - 8 degrees.
- MeasureOf(Angle(U,V,W), 3x - 11) → ∠UVW is 3x - 11.
- MeasureOf(Angle(V,W,Y), x + 8) → ∠VWY is x + 8. Wait, but the question says angle W is x + 8. Wait, angle W would be ∠VWY? Because in a pentagon, the vertices are U, V, W, Y, Z. So angle at point W would be formed by points V, W, Y. So yes, ∠VWY is angle W. Therefore, angle W is x + 8. But wait, the problem states that angle W is x + 8, so maybe that's one of the angles already given here. Wait, but the other angles are also given in terms of x. So perhaps I need to set up an equation where all the angles add up to 540 degrees.

Let me check all the angles mentioned:

Given angles:

1. ∠VUZ (at point U?) Wait, Angle(V,U,Z) is the angle at point U, between points V, U, Z. Wait, no. In standard notation, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at point B, between points A, B, C. So ∠VUZ is the angle at point U, between points V, U, Z. Similarly, ∠UVW is the angle at point V, between points U, V, W. ∠VWY is angle at point W, between points V, W, Y. ∠WYZ is angle at point Y, between W, Y, Z. And ∠YZU is angle at point Z, between Y, Z, U. 

Wait, but the pentagon is UVWYZ. So the order of the vertices is U connected to V, V to W, W to Y, Y to Z, Z back to U. So the angles at each vertex are:

At U: between Z, U, V? Or wait, the angle at each vertex is formed by two adjacent sides. For example, angle at U would be between side ZU and UV. Wait, but according to the given predicates, there are several angles listed. Let me make sure I'm interpreting these correctly.

But the problem mentions "angle W" which is the angle at vertex W. According to the given predicates, Angle(V,W,Y) is x + 8, which is indeed the angle at W. So that's our angle W. Now, the rest of the angles are:

- ∠VUZ (at U): x - 8
- ∠UVW (at V): 3x - 11
- ∠VWY (at W): x + 8
- ∠WYZ (at Y): x
- ∠YZU (at Z): 2x + 7

So adding all these angles together should give us the total sum of 540 degrees. Let's write that equation:

(x - 8) + (3x - 11) + (x + 8) + x + (2x + 7) = 540

Let me combine like terms:

First, expand all terms:

x - 8 + 3x - 11 + x + 8 + x + 2x + 7.

Combine the x terms:

x + 3x + x + x + 2x = 8x

Constant terms:

-8 -11 +8 +7 = (-8 -11) + (8 +7) = (-19) + 15 = -4

So overall equation is 8x - 4 = 540

Adding 4 to both sides: 8x = 544

Divide both sides by 8: x = 544 / 8 = 68

Then, angle W is x + 8, so substituting x = 68 gives 68 + 8 = 76 degrees.

Looking at the answer choices, C is 76. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check my equations. Did I include all angles?

Original angles:

1. ∠VUZ (at U): x - 8
2. ∠UVW (at V): 3x - 11
3. ∠VWY (at W): x + 8
4. ∠WYZ (at Y): x
5. ∠YZU (at Z): 2x + 7

Yes, those are the five angles of the pentagon. Summing them gives 8x -4 = 540. Solving gives x = 68, so angle W is 68 +8=76. So answer is C. Hence, Final Answer: C.
