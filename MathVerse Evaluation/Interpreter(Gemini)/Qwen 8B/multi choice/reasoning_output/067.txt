MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, C, D, E. Lines AB, CD, AC, AE. There's an angle at A, C, D called Angle(A,C,D) which measures 40 degrees. Also, Line AB is parallel to Line CD. Then there's a bisector AE that bisects angle CAB, so that means AE splits angle CAB into two equal parts. Additionally, we know that Point E lies on line AE, and there's a triangle ACE mentioned.

So, the main goal is to find the measure of angle AEC. The answer choices are 40°, 70°, 80°, or 140°. 

Let me try to visualize the diagram. Since AB is parallel to CD, maybe there's some corresponding angles or alternate interior angles involved. But first, let's note down all the given angles and relationships.

Given that angle ACD is 40 degrees. Wait, angle ACD would be at point C, between points A, C, D. So that's angle at C formed by lines CA and CD. Also, since AB is parallel to CD, maybe there's some relationship between angles involving these lines.

Now, AE bisects angle CAB. So angle CAB is being split into two equal angles by AE. That means angle CAE equals angle EAB. Let me denote angle CAB as some value. Let's say angle CAB is x degrees. Then, because AE bisects it, each part would be x/2 degrees. 

But wait, we also have angle ACD = 40 degrees. How does that relate? Let me think about triangle ACD or other triangles here. Since AB is parallel to CD, maybe there's a transversal cutting them, creating some equal angles. For example, if we consider line AC as a transversal intersecting AB and CD. Since AB || CD, the consecutive interior angles would add up to 180 degrees. But angle at A (CAB) and angle at C (ACD) could be supplementary?

Wait, angle CAB is at point A, between CA and AB. And angle ACD is at point C, between AC and CD. Because AB || CD, and AC is a transversal. Therefore, angle CAB and angle ACD should be same-side interior angles, so they should add up to 180 degrees. Therefore, angle CAB + angle ACD = 180°. Given angle ACD is 40°, so angle CAB would be 180 - 40 = 140 degrees. 

Wait, but that seems big. Let me check again. If AB is parallel to CD, then the transversal AC creates angles at A and C. So yes, angle CAB and angle ACD are same-side interior angles, hence summing to 180°. Therefore, angle CAB is 140°, which would mean that each of the bisected angles (since AE bisects angle CAB) is 70°, because 140 divided by 2 is 70. So angle CAE is 70°, and angle EAB is also 70°.

Now, we need to find angle AEC. Let's look at triangle AEC. In triangle AEC, we know one angle at A, which is angle CAE = 70°, and we might need to find another angle or use some properties. Wait, but do we have any other angles in triangle AEC?

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle AEC and triangle something else. Or maybe looking at other angles created by the parallel lines and the transversals. Let me think again.

Since AE is the angle bisector, and AB is parallel to CD, maybe there's some relationship between angles around point E. Alternatively, since we have point E lying on AE, and knowing that angle EAB is 70°, maybe there's a way to relate that with other angles.

Wait, let's consider triangle AEC. The angles in triangle AEC are at points A, E, and C. We already have angle at A (CAE) as 70°, and we need to find angle at E (AEC). To find that, we need more information about the other angles in the triangle or other angles in the figure.

But maybe we can find angle at C in triangle AEC. Let's see. At point C, we have angle ACD = 40°, which is part of the larger structure. However, angle at C in triangle AEC would depend on how line EC interacts with other lines. Wait, point E is connected to A and C? Wait, the line AE exists, but where is point E located? Since AE is a line from A to E, and E is a point such that AE bisects angle CAB. So E is somewhere along the extension of the angle bisector of CAB.

But perhaps we need to consider triangle AEC and use the fact that AB is parallel to CD. Maybe there's a way to find some angles via parallel lines. Let me think again about the angles.

Since AB is parallel to CD, and AC is a transversal, angle CAB and angle ACD are same-side interior angles adding to 180°, as before. So angle CAB is 140°, leading to each bisected angle being 70°. Now, looking at triangle AEC, we have angle at A as 70°, and we need to find angle at E. What's the third angle in triangle AEC?

The third angle would be at point C, which is angle ACE. So if we can find angle ACE, then we can compute angle AEC as 180° minus 70° minus angle ACE.

How to find angle ACE? Let's think. At point C, we have angle ACD = 40°, which is the angle between AC and CD. Is there a relation between angle ACE and angle ACD?

Well, if we can determine whether line CE is aligned with CD or forms some other angle. Wait, point E is on line AE, which is the bisector of angle CAB. So CE connects point C to point E. But unless there's some other information about line CE, maybe we need to find relations via other triangles or parallelograms.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is the bisector of angle CAB, maybe there's a way to find some similar triangles or use the properties of parallel lines with transversals.

Wait, let's consider triangle ABC. Wait, but point D is involved. Hmm. Let me think again about the angles.

At point C, angle ACD is 40°, which is part of line CD. But line CE is connecting C to E. Unless CE is parallel to something or forms a certain angle. Wait, maybe triangle AEC has some relation with other elements.

Alternatively, since AE bisects angle CAB, and AB || CD, maybe there's an alternate interior angle relationship involving line AE. Wait, but AE isn't necessarily parallel to anything. Alternatively, maybe considering triangle AEC and triangle something else.

Wait, let's consider the angles at point A. Since angle CAB is 140°, and AE bisects it into two angles of 70° each. So angle CAE is 70°, and angle EAB is 70°. Now, since AB || CD, and line AE intersects AB at A, maybe there's a way to find some angles related to line AE and CD.

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle AED or another triangle. Wait, but without knowing where point D is relative to E, it's hard to tell.

Wait, but the problem mentions angle ACD = 40°, which is at point C between A and D. So line CD is going from C to D, which is parallel to AB. So, if we imagine line CD extending from C, parallel to AB. Now, point E is somewhere such that AE bisects angle CAB. So, point E is inside the plane, connected to A, and forming the angle bisector.

Maybe we can use the concept of exterior angles or something else. Let me think about triangle AEC. If I can find angle at C (ACE), then I can compute angle AEC.

To find angle ACE, perhaps consider that line CD is parallel to AB, and line AC is a transversal. So angle ACD is 40°, which is same-side interior with angle CAB (which was 140°). Now, if we can find angle ACE, which is adjacent to angle ACD? Not sure yet.

Wait, angle ACE is part of the angle at point C. If line CE is drawn from C to E, then angle ACE is adjacent to angle ACD if line CE is aligned with CD. But unless CE is colinear with CD, which we don't know. So perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe triangle AEC and triangle something share angles. Let me think about the angles in triangle AEC again. We have angle at A: 70°, angle at E: ?, angle at C: ?. Sum to 180°. If I can find angle at C (ACE), then subtract from 180° to get angle AEC.

But how to find angle ACE? Let me think. Perhaps there's a way to express angle ACE in terms of other angles. Since AB || CD, and line CE may form some angles with those lines.

Alternatively, since AE is the angle bisector, and AB || CD, maybe there's a way to find some proportional segments or similar triangles. Wait, but without knowing if any sides are proportional, it's unclear.

Wait, here's an idea: since AB is parallel to CD, and AE is a transversal, maybe there's some relationship between angles formed by AE and the parallel lines. For instance, if we consider line AE intersecting AB at A and CD at some point. Wait, but line AE starts at A and goes towards E, which is not necessarily on CD. So that might not help directly.

Alternatively, since angle ACD is 40°, and AB || CD, then angle between AE and CD could be related to angle CAB. Wait, maybe not. 

Another approach: Let's consider triangle AEC. We need angle AEC. If we can find two angles in this triangle, we can find the third. We already have angle at A as 70°, so if we can find angle at C (ACE), then angle AEC = 180 - 70 - ACE.

But how to find ACE? Let's consider that angle ACD is 40°, which is at point C. If line CE makes an angle with CD, then maybe that relates to angle ACE. Suppose line CE makes some angle with CD. Let me think about the direction of CE.

Since E is on the angle bisector of CAB, which is 70°, so AE divides angle CAB into two 70° angles. So, if I imagine point E somewhere off the diagram, connected to A and C. Without more info, it's tricky. Maybe we need to use the fact that AE is the angle bisector and AB || CD to find some other angles.

Wait, here's another thought: Since AB || CD, then the corresponding angles made by transversal AC would be equal. So angle CAB corresponds to angle ACD? Wait, earlier we said they were same-side interior angles, adding to 180°, but maybe there's another pair of angles.

Wait, angle CAB is at point A, while angle ACD is at point C. If AB || CD, then the corresponding angles would involve angles on the same side. For example, if we have a transversal AC crossing AB and CD, then angle CAB and angle ACD are same-side interior angles, thus adding to 180°, as previously determined. So angle CAB = 140°, angle ACD = 40°, which adds to 180°, confirming that.

Now, since AE bisects angle CAB into two 70° angles, angle CAE = 70°, and angle EAB = 70°. Now, let's consider line AE. Since AB || CD, and line AE intersects AB at A, maybe there's a way to find some angles related to line AE and CD.

For instance, if we extend line AE until it meets CD at some point, say F. Then, AF would be a transversal intersecting AB and CD. But since AB || CD, the corresponding angles would be equal. However, without knowing where E is in relation to CD, this might not be helpful.

Alternatively, since angle EAB is 70°, and AB || CD, then the corresponding angle at D would be equal. Wait, maybe not directly applicable.

Wait, here's another idea: In triangle AEC, if we can find angle at C (ACE), then we can proceed. To find angle ACE, maybe consider that line CE is forming some angle with CD. Since angle ACD is 40°, and if line CE is making an angle with CD, then angle ACE would be related to that.

But how? Let's assume that line CE is such that it creates some relationship with CD. For example, if line CE is parallel to AB, then angle ACE would be equal to angle CAB or something. But there's no information given that CE is parallel to anything.

Alternatively, maybe triangle AEC and triangle something are similar. But without enough information, it's difficult.

Wait, perhaps using the exterior angle theorem. In triangle AEC, angle at E is AEC, which is an exterior angle if we consider some other triangle. Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, since angle CAB is 140°, and AE bisects it into 70°, and AB || CD, maybe there's a way to find angle EAD or something. Wait, but point D is involved in angle ACD.

Wait, let me try to summarize the known angles:

- angle CAB = 140°
- angle CAE = 70°
- angle ACD = 40°
- AB || CD
- AE bisects angle CAB

Now, focusing on triangle AEC. Need angle AEC. So, if I can find angle at C, ACE, then:

angle AEC = 180° - angle CAE - angle ACE = 180 - 70 - ACE = 110 - ACE.

But how to find ACE? Let's think about point C. At point C, we have angle ACD = 40°, which is the angle between AC and CD. If line CE is drawn from C to E, then angle ACE is part of that angle. Unless line CE aligns with CD, which would make angle ACE equal to angle ACD. But that would imply that E lies on CD. Is there any reason to believe that?

Wait, but AE is the angle bisector of CAB, and E is a point on AE. If E were on CD, then line AE would intersect CD at E. But since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the intersection point E would create some angles. However, without more information, we can't assume that E is on CD. So that might not hold.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the fact that AE bisects angle CAB and AB || CD to find some relationship between angles involving E and CD.

Wait, let me think about the angles at point A. Since angle CAB is 140°, and AE bisects it into two 70° angles. So, angle between CA and AE is 70°, and between AE and AB is also 70°. Now, since AB || CD, the angle between AE and AB is 70°, which would correspond to the angle between AE and CD if there's a transversal. Wait, but AE is not necessarily parallel to anything. 

Wait, if we consider line AE and line CD, since AB || CD, then the angle between AE and AB is 70°, so the angle between AE and CD would be supplementary if they are on the same side. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the angle between AE and AB is equal to the angle between AE and CD if they are corresponding angles. But that would require that AE is a transversal intersecting both AB and CD. However, AE starts at A and extends towards E, which may or may not meet CD. If E is such that AE extended meets CD at some point, say F, then angle between AE and AB (which is 70°) would be equal to the angle between AE and CD at point F. But again, without knowing where E is, this is speculative.

This seems complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me go back to triangle AEC. If I can find angle at C, ACE, then I can find angle AEC.

Since angle ACD is 40°, and if line CE makes some angle with CD, then angle ACE = angle ACD - angle ECD. But without knowing angle ECD, this is not helpful.

Wait, but maybe line CE is such that it creates an angle with CD that's related to angle EAB. Since AE is the angle bisector, and AB || CD, perhaps there's a way to connect these.

Alternatively, since angle EAB is 70°, and AB || CD, then the corresponding angle on CD would be 70°, implying that the angle between AE and CD is 70°. But that would mean that angle between AE and CD is 70°, so angle between AE and CD is 70°, which could be angle ECD. Then, angle ACE would be angle ACD - angle ECD = 40° - 70°, which is negative. That doesn't make sense, so my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, maybe it's supplementary. If angle between AE and AB is 70°, then the corresponding angle on CD would be 180° - 70° = 110°, since AB || CD. So angle between AE and CD would be 110°, making angle ECD = 110°, which would mean angle ACE = angle ACD - angle ECD? No, that still doesn't fit.

Alternatively, angle ECD would be equal to angle EAB due to parallel lines. Wait, if AB || CD, then the angle between AE and AB (which is 70°) would correspond to the angle between AE and CD on the opposite side. So, angle between AE and CD would be 70°, meaning angle ECD = 70°. Then, angle ACE = angle ACD - angle ECD = 40° - 70°, which is negative again. This suggests that my understanding is flawed.

Perhaps I need to draw a diagram mentally. Let me try again:

Imagine AB is a horizontal line, CD is parallel to it, so also horizontal. Point C is somewhere above AB, connected to D. Line AC connects A to C, forming an angle CAB of 140°, which is quite large. AE bisects this angle into two 70° angles. So, from point A, line AE splits the 140° angle into two 70° angles. Point E is somewhere along that bisector. Now, angle ACD is 40°, which is the angle at point C between AC and CD. Since CD is parallel to AB, and AC is a transversal, angle CAB (140°) and angle ACD (40°) are same-side interior angles, adding to 180°, which checks out.

Now, to find angle AEC. Let's focus on triangle AEC. We have angle at A: 70°, and we need to find angle at E. If I can find angle at C (ACE), then I can calculate angle AEC.

To find angle ACE, perhaps consider that line CE is forming some relationship with CD. Since angle ACD is 40°, and CD is parallel to AB, maybe there's a way to relate angle ACE with other angles.

Wait, suppose we extend CE until it meets AB at some point, say F. Then, triangle AEC would be part of that. But without knowing where E is, it's hard to say. Alternatively, since AE is the angle bisector, and AB || CD, maybe triangle AEC has some relationship with triangle something.

Wait, here's a new idea: Since AE bisects angle CAB, and AB || CD, then maybe triangle AEC is similar to some other triangle. Let's explore that.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is the angle bisector, then maybe there's a proportionality between segments. But without knowing about lengths, this might not help.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the sum of angles in triangle AEC. We have angle at A = 70°, and we need angle AEC. If we can find angle at C (ACE), then we can compute angle AEC. Let's try to find angle ACE.

At point C, angle ACD is 40°, which is between AC and CD. If we can find the angle between AC and CE (which is angle ACE), then we can find it. But how?

Suppose line CE makes some angle with CD. Since AB || CD, and AE is the angle bisector, maybe there's a way to find that angle.

Let me think about the angles around point E. Since AE is the bisector, and AB || CD, perhaps there's a relationship between angles at E involving parallel lines.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the sum of angles around point E is 360°, but that might not help directly.

Wait, here's a possibility: Since AE bisects angle CAB, and AB || CD, then the angle between AE and AB is 70°, which would be equal to the angle between AE and CD due to the parallel lines. Wait, but that would mean that the angle between AE and CD is 70°, so angle between AE and CD is 70°, which would be angle ECD. Then, in triangle ACD, we have angle at C (ACD) = 40°, angle at D (if we knew it), but not sure.

Wait, but if angle between AE and CD is 70°, then angle ECD = 70°, and angle ACD is 40°, so angle ACE = angle ACD - angle ECD = 40° - 70° = -30°, which is impossible. So that can't be right.

Hmm, this suggests that my assumption is wrong. Perhaps the angle between AE and CD is not 70°, but something else.

Wait, maybe the angle between AE and CD is supplementary to 70°, because of the parallel lines. So, if the angle between AE and AB is 70°, then the angle between AE and CD would be 180° - 70° = 110°, because of the parallel lines. So, angle between AE and CD is 110°, which would be angle ECD = 110°. Then, angle ACE = angle ACD - angle ECD? No, because angle ACE is part of angle ACD. Wait, angle ACD is 40°, which is the angle between AC and CD. If line CE makes an angle with CD of 110°, then angle ACE would be 40° - 110°, which is negative again. Still impossible.

This indicates that my approach is missing something. Let me think differently.

Maybe I need to use the fact that AE is the angle bisector and apply the angle bisector theorem. The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the opposite sides. But since we're dealing with angles, not sides, maybe it's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, since we're dealing with angles, maybe using trigonometric identities or laws like the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangle AEC. But without knowing side lengths, this might be challenging.

Wait, but maybe I can assign variables and set up equations. Let me attempt that.

Let’s denote angle ACE as x degrees. Then, in triangle AEC, the angles are:

- angle at A: 70°
- angle at C: x
- angle at E: y (which we want to find)

So, 70 + x + y = 180 → y = 110 - x.

Now, if I can find x, then I can find y.

How to find x? Let's think about point C. At point C, we have angle ACD = 40°, which is between AC and CD. If I can relate x to this angle.

Assuming that line CE forms some angle with CD. Let's say angle ECD is z. Then, angle ACE = angle ACD - angle ECD = 40° - z. So, x = 40° - z.

Now, if I can find z, then x is known. How to find z?

Since AB || CD, and line AE intersects AB at A and CD at some point (assuming E is on CD, but earlier assumption was incorrect). Wait, but if E is not on CD, then line AE doesn't intersect CD. So, this approach might not work.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the angle between AE and AB (which is 70°) is equal to the angle between AE and CD on the other side. Wait, if AE is a transversal, then the alternate interior angles would be equal. But since AB || CD, and AE is a transversal, then the angle between AE and AB (at point A) would be equal to the angle between AE and CD on the other side. So, angle between AE and AB is 70°, so the corresponding angle on CD would also be 70°, which would be angle between AE and CD at point... wherever AE intersects CD. But if AE intersects CD at point E, then that angle would be 70°, which would be angle ECD = 70°. 

Wait, if AE intersects CD at E, then angle between AE and CD at E is 70°, so angle ECD = 70°. Then, angle ACE = angle ACD - angle ECD = 40° - 70° = -30°, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction. So, this suggests that AE does not intersect CD, so E is not on CD. Thus, this approach is invalid.

Alternative idea: Since AE is the angle bisector, and AB || CD, then maybe there's a way to find angle AEC using vertical angles or something else.

Wait, let me recall that in triangle AEC, we have angle at A = 70°, and if I can find another angle, then I can find the third. Maybe I can find angle at C by considering other triangles.

Wait, what about triangle ACD? In triangle ACD, we know angle at C is 40°, and we know angle at A is angle CAB, which is 140°, but wait, angle at A in triangle ACD would be angle CAD. Wait, but point D is not necessarily related to triangle ACD in a way that helps.

Alternatively, since AB || CD, and AC is a transversal, then angle CAB (140°) and angle ACD (40°) are supplementary, as discussed earlier. Now, if we can find angle at D in some triangle, but I don't have enough information.

Maybe I need to consider that angle AEC is an external angle to some triangle, allowing me to use the exterior angle theorem. For example, if angle AEC is an external angle to triangle ACE, but that doesn't help directly.

Wait, here's a different plan: Let me consider that in triangle AEC, angle at E is what we need. If I can find the measure of angle at C (ACE) by relating it to angle ACD = 40° and some other angles.

Let me think about the full angle at point C. At point C, we have angle ACD = 40°, which is part of the angle between AC and CD. If line CE forms some angle with CD, then angle ACE is part of that. But without knowing where E is, it's challenging.

Wait, but maybe there's a property I'm missing. Since AE bisects angle CAB, and AB || CD, then maybe triangle AEC has some relation to triangle something.

Wait, let's consider drawing line CE. Since AE is the angle bisector, and AB || CD, perhaps triangle AEC is similar to another triangle. For example, if there's a similarity ratio.

Alternatively, since AE bisects angle CAB, and AB || CD, then maybe the ratio of AE to EC is related to some other segment. But without length information, this is hard.

Wait, perhaps I need to use the fact that the sum of angles around point E is 360°, but again, without knowing other angles at E, it's not helpful.

I think I've been stuck here for too long. Let me recap:

- angle CAB = 140°, so angle CAE = 70°
- angle ACD = 40°
- AB || CD
- Need to find angle AEC in triangle AEC

In triangle AEC, angles are 70°, x, and y (where x is angle ACE, y is angle AEC).

So, 70 + x + y = 180 → y = 110 - x.

If I can find x, then I can find y.

Now, to find x, angle ACE, let's think about point C. At point C, angle ACD is 40°, which is between AC and CD. If I can find the angle between AC and CE (which is angle ACE), then x is known. But how?

Maybe using the fact that AE is the angle bisector and AB || CD to find some relationship between angles at point C.

Wait, since AB || CD, and line AE intersects AB at A, then the angle between AE and AB is 70°, which would be equal to the angle between AE and CD on the opposite side. Wait, this is similar to earlier thoughts. If AB || CD, then the alternate interior angles would be equal. But AE is not a transversal between AB and CD unless it intersects both. If AE intersects AB at A and CD at some point, say F, then angle between AE and AB at A is equal to the angle between AE and CD at F. So, angle between AE and AB is 70°, so angle between AE and CD at F is also 70°, which would be angle EFD = 70°, where F is the intersection point of AE and CD.

But if E is the intersection point, then E would be on both AE and CD. So, if E is the point where AE meets CD, then angle between AE and CD at E is 70°, which would be angle CED = 70°. Then, in triangle CED, we might have some information.

But if E is on CD, then angle ACE is part of angle ACD. Let me assume that E is on CD. Then, angle ACE = angle ACD - angle ECD. But if E is on CD, then angle ECD is zero, since E is on CD. That doesn't make sense. Wait, no. If E is on CD, then CE is a segment from C to E on CD, so angle ACE would be the same as angle ACD, which is 40°, making x = 40°, so angle AEC = 110 - 40 = 70°, which would make the answer B:70°. But is this valid?

Wait, but why would E be on CD? The problem states that AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB, and E is a point such that AE bisects that angle. It doesn't necessarily mean that E is on CD. So this assumption may be incorrect.

However, if we assume that E is the intersection of AE and CD, then this would give us angle ACE = 40°, leading to angle AEC = 70°, which is option B. But is this assumption valid?

Let me verify. If AE is the angle bisector of angle CAB, and AB || CD, then line AE, when extended, might intersect CD at some point E. If that's the case, then angle between AE and CD at E would be equal to angle between AE and AB at A, due to parallel lines. So, angle at E between AE and CD is 70°, which would be angle CED = 70°. Then, in triangle CED, we have angle at C = 40°, angle at E = 70°, so angle at D would be 180 - 40 - 70 = 70°, making triangle CED isoceles with CE = CD. But this is assuming E is on CD.

If this is the case, then in triangle AEC, angle at C is angle ACE. But if E is on CD, then CE is part of CD, so angle ACE is the same as angle ACD, which is 40°, making angle ACE = 40°, and thus angle AEC = 110 - 40 = 70°, which would be option B.

But does this assumption hold? Why would AE intersect CD at E? Well, the problem says that AE is the angle bisector, but it doesn't specify where E is. However, since AE is defined as the bisector, it must extend beyond A to some point E. If we assume that E is the intersection of AE with CD, then this holds.

But is there any reason to believe that AE intersects CD? Well, since AB is parallel to CD, and AE starts at A, which is on AB, then extending AE would either intersect CD or not. Depending on the configuration, it might or might not. But since the problem includes point D and mentions angle ACD, it's likely that E is on CD. Otherwise, the problem wouldn't mention it.

Thus, assuming E is on CD, then angle ACE = 40°, leading to angle AEC = 70°, which would be option B.

But wait, let's double-check this. If E is on CD, then in triangle AEC, angle at C is 40°, angle at A is 70°, so angle at E is 180 - 70 - 40 = 70°, which gives angle AEC = 70°, which is option B. This seems plausible.

But why would E be on CD? Because the problem mentions angle ACD = 40°, which involves point D, and AE is the angle bisector. It's possible that E is chosen such that it lies on CD, making the intersection point. This would make sense in the context of the problem.

Therefore, under this assumption, the answer would be B:70°.

But let me verify once more. If E is on CD, then line AE passes through E, which is on CD. Then, angle between AE and CD at E is 70°, as per the parallel lines. Then, in triangle CED, angles at C and E are 40° and 70°, respectively, making angle at D 70°, as before. This makes triangle CED isoceles with CE = ED. But this is just extra information.

Back to triangle AEC: angle at C is 40°, angle at A is 70°, so angle at E is 70°, making it an isoceles triangle with AC = EC. But without knowing if that's true, it's okay. The calculation still holds.

Thus, the measure of angle AEC is 70°, which is option B.
