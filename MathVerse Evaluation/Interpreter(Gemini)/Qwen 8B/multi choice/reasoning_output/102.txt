MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how to find the length of CE. Let me start by breaking down the problem step by step.

So, the setup says that AB is the diameter of circle O. Points C and D are on the circle. Also, point C is the midpoint of arc BD. Then, there's a perpendicular line EF drawn from point C to AD, intersecting AD at point E. We're told the radius of the circle is 2.5 units, and the length of AC is 4.0 units. We need to find CE.

First, let me recall some circle theorems. Since AB is the diameter, the center O is the midpoint of AB. Given that the radius is 2.5, so AB must be twice that, which is 5 units. Wait, but they also mention that OA is a radius, so OA = OB = 2.5. But the length of AC is given as 4.0. Hmm, since A is on the circle, OA is the radius, so OA = 2.5, but AC is 4.0? That seems longer than the radius. Maybe I need to think about coordinates here?

Let me sketch a diagram mentally. Let's consider coordinate system with O at the origin. Let’s place point A at (-2.5, 0) and point B at (2.5, 0) because AB is the diameter. So the center O is at (0,0). Now, points C and D lie on the circle. Also, point C is the midpoint of arc BD. Since arcs BD are being considered, and C is the midpoint, that means arc BC equals arc CD. 

Given that AB is the diameter, the circle has radius 2.5. The length AC is 4.0. Wait, point A is (-2.5,0), and point C is somewhere on the circle. The distance between A and C is 4.0. Let me compute coordinates of point C such that AC = 4.0. 

But maybe using coordinates would help. Let me assign coordinates. Let me denote O as (0,0), A(-2.5, 0), B(2.5, 0). Let me parametrize point C. Since it's on the circle, its coordinates satisfy x² + y² = (2.5)^2 = 6.25. Also, the distance from A to C is 4.0. The distance formula gives sqrt[(x + 2.5)^2 + (y - 0)^2] = 4. Squaring both sides: (x + 2.5)^2 + y^2 = 16. 

But since x² + y² = 6.25, substitute that into the first equation. Expanding (x + 2.5)^2 + y² = x² + 5x + 6.25 + y² = (x² + y²) + 5x + 6.25 = 6.25 + 5x + 6.25 = 12.5 + 5x = 16. Therefore, 5x = 16 - 12.5 = 3.5 → x = 3.5 / 5 = 0.7. So x-coordinate of C is 0.7. 

Now, substituting back x=0.7 into x² + y² = 6.25. So (0.7)^2 + y² = 6.25 → 0.49 + y² = 6.25 → y² = 6.25 - 0.49 = 5.76 → y = ±√5.76 = ±2.4. So point C is either (0.7, 2.4) or (0.7, -2.4). But since the problem mentions drawing a perpendicular line EF from C to AD, which intersects AD at E. Depending on where C is, the direction of EF may vary. However, since we have right angles mentioned (like Angle(AEC) and Angle(DEC) being right angles), perhaps the position of C is determined. Let me assume C is above the x-axis; so (0.7, 2.4).

Wait, but the problem states that EF is perpendicular to AD. Let me check the coordinates of AD. Point A is (-2.5, 0), and point D is another point on the circle. Wait, but where is D located? Since C is the midpoint of arc BD. Since AB is the diameter, and C is midpoint of arc BD, then BD is an arc whose midpoint is C. Let me think about the position of D. 

Since C is the midpoint of arc BD, then arcs BC and CD are equal. So, starting from B, going counterclockwise along the circumference, the arc to C is equal to arc from C to D. Since AB is the diameter, points B and A are endpoints. Let me think about the circle. Let me imagine the circle with points A(-2.5,0), B(2.5,0), and O(0,0). The arc BD is such that C is the midpoint. So depending on whether the arc is major or minor, but since C is on the circle, probably the arc BD is not overlapping AB. 

Alternatively, since C is the midpoint of arc BD, then BD is an arc that doesn't contain A. Because if C is the midpoint, then BD could be an arc that goes from B to D through the opposite side of the circle from A. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me try to find coordinates for D.

But maybe instead of dealing with coordinates, use angles. Let me consider angles subtended by arcs. Since AB is the diameter, angle ACB would be a right angle if C is on the circle. Wait, but C is on the circle, so triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with AB as diameter, making angle ACB a right angle. Wait, but earlier calculation shows that AC is 4.0, which is longer than the radius. Let me confirm if that's possible. 

Wait, AB is 5 units long (since radius is 2.5). If triangle ABC has AB as hypotenuse, then AC and BC should satisfy AC² + BC² = AB². Let me check with AC=4.0. Then BC² = AB² - AC² = 25 - 16 = 9 → BC = 3. So BC is 3 units. So in triangle ABC, AC=4, BC=3, AB=5, forming a 3-4-5 right triangle. That makes sense. So point C lies such that triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Therefore, coordinates of C can be found accordingly. 

Earlier, I found that the x-coordinate of C is 0.7, which is 7/10. Let me check if that aligns with the 3-4-5 triangle. For instance, if AB is horizontal from (-2.5,0) to (2.5,0), then point C would form a right angle at C. In that case, coordinates of C can be found via coordinates. 

Alternatively, since in a right triangle with hypotenuse AB (from A(-2.5,0) to B(2.5,0)) and right angle at C, then coordinates of C must satisfy that vectors AC and BC are perpendicular. So vector AC · vector BC = 0. 

Vector AC is (x + 2.5, y). Vector BC is (x - 2.5, y). Their dot product is (x+2.5)(x-2.5) + y*y = x² - (2.5)^2 + y². But since point C is on the circle, x² + y² = (2.5)^2. Therefore, the dot product becomes (2.5)^2 - (2.5)^2 = 0. Hence, indeed, AC ⊥ BC. So this confirms that triangle ABC is right-angled at C. 

Therefore, coordinates of C are (0.7, 2.4) as previously calculated. Now, moving on. 

We need to find CE, where EF is perpendicular to AD and passes through C, intersecting AD at E. 

First, find the equation of line AD. Points A(-2.5, 0) and D. Wait, but where is D? Since C is the midpoint of arc BD. Let me find coordinates of D. 

Since C is the midpoint of arc BD, arcs BC and CD are equal. Let me recall that in a circle, the measure of an arc corresponds to the central angle. So if arc BC equals arc CD, then central angles ∠BOC and ∠COD are equal. Therefore, points B, C, D are arranged such that moving from B to C to D along the circumference covers equal arcs. 

Let me calculate the central angles. The total circumference corresponds to 360 degrees. Let me compute the central angle for arc BC. Since AB is the diameter, the central angle for AB is 180 degrees. Let me find the central angle for arc BC. 

In triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C, angle at B is angle ABC. Using trigonometry, tan(angle ABC) = AC / BC = 4 / 3. Therefore, angle ABC = arctan(4/3). Which is approximately 53.13 degrees. Similarly, angle BAC is arctan(BC / AC) = arctan(3/4) ≈ 36.87 degrees. 

But these angles are angles in triangle ABC, which is inscribed in the circle. The central angles corresponding to arcs BC and AC. Wait, the central angle over arc BC would be twice the inscribed angle over the same arc. Wait, angle at A is angle BAC, which is an inscribed angle subtending arc BC. Therefore, the central angle for arc BC is 2 * angle BAC. 

Wait, angle BAC is part of triangle ABC. Let me clarify. The inscribed angle subtended by arc BC would be angle BAC. Because point A is on the circumference, looking at arc BC. So yes, angle BAC is half the measure of arc BC. Therefore, the central angle for arc BC is 2 * angle BAC. 

Similarly, since C is the midpoint of arc BD, arc BC equals arc CD. Therefore, arc BC = arc CD. Therefore, the central angle for arc BC equals that for arc CD. So, the central angle for arc BD is twice that of arc BC. 

But I need to find coordinates of D. Let me think. Since C is the midpoint of arc BD, then D is symmetrically placed relative to C with respect to the circle. Let me try to find coordinates of D. 

Assuming that the arc BD is such that C is its midpoint. Let me consider the central angles. Let me denote θ as the central angle for arc BC. Then the central angle for arc CD is also θ. Therefore, the total central angle for arc BD is 2θ. 

Additionally, since AB is the diameter, the central angle for arc AB is π radians (180 degrees). Let me think about the entire circle. Let me consider the positions of B, C, D. Starting from point B, moving along the circumference to C, then to D. 

Let me calculate θ. From earlier, angle BAC is arctan(3/4), which is the inscribed angle subtended by arc BC. Therefore, the central angle for arc BC is 2 * angle BAC. 

Calculating angle BAC: in triangle ABC, right-angled at C, with AC = 4, BC = 3, AB = 5. Therefore, angle at A (angle BAC) is arcsin(BC/AB) = arcsin(3/5), which is approx 36.87 degrees. Therefore, central angle for arc BC is 2*arcsin(3/5). 

Alternatively, using coordinates, since point C is at (0.7, 2.4). The central angle for arc BC can be calculated based on coordinates. Let me find the angle of point B and point C with respect to the center O(0,0). 

Coordinates of B: (2.5, 0). Coordinates of C: (0.7, 2.4). The angle for point B with respect to O is 0 radians (along positive x-axis). The angle for point C can be found using tan(theta) = y/x = 2.4 / 0.7 ≈ 3.4286. So theta ≈ arctan(2.4 / 0.7) ≈ arctan(3.4286). Let me compute that. Well, tan(73.3 degrees) is roughly 3.27, tan(74 degrees) is about 3.487. So 2.4 / 0.7 ≈ 3.4286, which is close to 73.3 degrees. Let me check:

tan(73°) ≈ 3.2709, tan(73.5°) ≈ 3.306, tan(73.75°) ≈ 3.373, tan(74°) ≈ 3.487. So 3.4286 is between 73.75° and 74°, say approximately 73.75°. 

Therefore, the central angle between points B and C is approximately 73.75 degrees. Since C is the midpoint of arc BD, then arc CD is also 73.75 degrees. Therefore, the central angle from C to D is the same as from B to C. So point D would be obtained by rotating point C by the same angle in the same direction (assuming the arc BD is the one that does not contain A). 

Wait, but since AB is the diameter, and the circle is 360 degrees, let me see. If arc BD is such that C is the midpoint, then the arc BD is 2θ, where θ is the central angle for arc BC. 

But since AB is the diameter, the total circle is 360 degrees. Let me think about the position of D. If we move from B towards C (central angle θ), then from C to D another θ. So total arc BD is 2θ. 

But how does this relate to the rest of the circle? Let me calculate θ. Earlier, the central angle between B and C was approximately 73.75 degrees. So θ ≈ 73.75°, making arc BD ≈ 147.5°. 

However, there's another possibility: since arcs can be major or minor. But since C is the midpoint of arc BD, it depends on whether arc BD is major or minor. But given that AB is the diameter and C is positioned above the x-axis, likely arc BD is the minor arc. 

Alternatively, maybe we can calculate the exact value of θ. Let me do that. 

From earlier, in triangle ABC, angle at A is angle BAC, which is arcsin(BC/AB) = arcsin(3/5). Therefore, the central angle for arc BC is 2 * angle BAC = 2 arcsin(3/5). 

Using the identity that sin(θ) = 3/5, so θ = arcsin(3/5), then 2θ is the central angle. Let me compute cos(2θ) using double-angle formula: cos(2θ) = 1 - 2sin²θ = 1 - 2*(9/25) = 1 - 18/25 = 7/25. Therefore, the central angle for arc BC is arccos(7/25). 

Wait, but the central angle between points B and C can also be computed using coordinates. The vector from O to B is (2.5, 0), and from O to C is (0.7, 2.4). The cosine of the central angle between them is their dot product divided by the product of magnitudes. 

Dot product: (2.5)(0.7) + (0)(2.4) = 1.75. The magnitude of each vector is 2.5. Therefore, cos(φ) = 1.75 / (2.5 * 2.5) = 1.75 / 6.25 = 0.28. Which is 7/25 (since 7/25 = 0.28). So φ = arccos(7/25), confirming our previous calculation. 

Thus, the central angle between B and C is arccos(7/25), which is approximately 73.74 degrees. 

Therefore, since arc BD is twice that angle (because C is the midpoint), the central angle for arc BD is 2 * arccos(7/25). To find point D, we can rotate point C by the same angle again. Wait, but rotating point C by the central angle from B to C would give us point D. Wait, no. Since arc BD spans from B to D, with midpoint at C, then the central angle from B to D is 2θ, so the central angle from B to C is θ, and from C to D is θ. 

Therefore, to get point D, we can take point C and rotate it by θ around the center O. But since the rotation direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) affects the position. Assuming the arc BD is the minor arc, which is the shorter path from B to D. 

Alternatively, since point C is above the x-axis, and assuming arc BD is the minor arc, then point D would be located such that moving from B to C to D follows the upper half of the circle. 

To find coordinates of D, let me perform the rotation. Let me represent points as complex numbers for easier rotation. 

Point B is at (2.5, 0). The central angle from B to C is θ = arccos(7/25). To find point D, we need to go another θ from C. So starting from point B, moving θ to C, then another θ to D. 

Alternatively, since the central angle from B to D is 2θ, we can find point D by rotating point B by 2θ around O. 

But since point C is already θ away from B, then point D would be θ away from C in the same direction. 

Alternatively, using rotation matrices. Let me try that. 

The coordinates of point C are (0.7, 2.4). To find point D, which is θ radians counterclockwise from point C. Wait, but θ is the central angle between B and C. So if we rotate point C by θ radians around O, we'd get point D? Or maybe rotate in the opposite direction? 

Actually, since arc BD is from B to D through C, then the rotation from B to C is θ, so rotating point C by θ more in the same direction gives D. 

The rotation matrix for rotating a point (x,y) by angle α around the origin is:

x' = x cosα - y sinα  
y' = x sinα + y cosα  

So, let me compute the rotation of point C by angle θ (which is the central angle between B and C) to get point D. 

But first, we need to know θ. As before, cosθ = 7/25. Wait, wait—earlier, we had the central angle between B and C as φ = arccos(7/25). So θ = φ. 

So, let me denote cosφ = 7/25. Then sinφ = sqrt(1 - (7/25)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/625) = sqrt(576/625) = 24/25. 

So, to rotate point C by angle φ to get D. 

Point C is (0.7, 2.4). Applying rotation matrix with angle φ:

x' = 0.7 * cosφ - 2.4 * sinφ  
y' = 0.7 * sinφ + 2.4 * cosφ  

Substituting cosφ = 7/25 and sinφ = 24/25:

x' = 0.7*(7/25) - 2.4*(24/25)  
Calculate each term:

0.7*(7/25): 0.7 = 7/10, so (7/10)*(7/25) = 49/250  
2.4*(24/25): 2.4 = 12/5, so (12/5)*(24/25) = 288/125  

Convert to common denominator:

49/250 = 98/500  
288/125 = 1152/500  
So x' = 98/500 - 1152/500 = (98 - 1152)/500 = (-1054)/500 = -527/250 ≈ -2.108

Similarly for y':

y' = 0.7*(24/25) + 2.4*(7/25)  
Again, 0.7 = 7/10, so:

7/10 * 24/25 = 168/250  
2.4 = 12/5, so 12/5 * 7/25 = 84/125 = 168/250  

Adding together: 168/250 + 168/250 = 336/250 = 168/125 = 1.344

So coordinates of D are approximately (-2.108, 1.344). Wait, but this seems odd. Let me verify calculations:

Wait, for x':

Original x component: 0.7*cosφ - 2.4*sinφ  
cosφ = 7/25 = 0.28, sinφ = 24/25 = 0.96  
So:

0.7 * 0.28 = 0.196  
2.4 * 0.96 = 2.304  
So x' = 0.196 - 2.304 = -2.108  
Yes. 

For y':

0.7 * 0.96 = 0.672  
2.4 * 0.28 = 0.672  
Total y' = 0.672 + 0.672 = 1.344. Correct. 

So point D is at (-2.108, 1.344). Let me convert those decimals to fractions for accuracy. 

But maybe there's a better way. Let me note that 0.7 is 7/10, 2.4 is 12/5. Let me redo the calculation symbolically:

x' = (7/10)*(7/25) - (12/5)*(24/25)  
= 49/(250) - 288/125  
= 49/250 - 576/250  
= (49 - 576)/250 = -527/250  
Similarly, y' = (7/10)*(24/25) + (12/5)*(7/25)  
= (168/250) + (84/125)  
= 168/250 + 168/250  
= 336/250 = 168/125. 

So coordinates of D are (-527/250, 168/125). Simplify fractions:

-527/250 cannot be simplified further. 168/125 is 1.344. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake here. Because point D should be on the circle, so x² + y² should equal (2.5)^2 = 6.25. Let me check for D's coordinates:

x = -527/250 ≈ -2.108  
x² = (527)^2 / (250)^2  
But 527 squared is... well, regardless, since we derived it from rotation, it should be on the circle. Let me check with exact calculation:

Let me compute x'^2 + y'^2:

x' = -527/250, y' = 168/125 = 336/250. 

So x'^2 + y'^2 = (527² + 336²)/250². 

Compute numerator:

Note that 527² + 336². Let me see if there's a relation. Wait, original point C was (7/10, 12/5). When rotated, it's supposed to stay on the circle, so x'^2 + y'^2 should be equal to (2.5)^2 = 6.25. Let me check:

Original point C: (7/10, 12/5). Its square is (7/10)^2 + (12/5)^2 = 49/100 + 144/25 = 49/100 + 576/100 = 625/100 = 6.25. Correct. After rotation, the new point D should also be on the circle. Thus, the calculation is correct. 

Now, with coordinates of D, we can find the equation of line AD. Points A(-2.5, 0) and D(-527/250, 168/125). Let me write these as decimals for simplicity. 

Point A: (-2.5, 0)  
Point D: (-2.108, 1.344) 

First, let me find the slope of AD. Slope m_AD = (y_D - y_A)/(x_D - x_A) = (1.344 - 0)/(-2.108 - (-2.5)) = 1.344 / (0.392). 

Calculate that division: 1.344 ÷ 0.392. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 0.392: 1.344 / 0.392 = 3.428... Wait, 0.392 × 3.428 ≈ 1.344. Let me check: 0.392 × 3 = 1.176, 0.392 × 0.4 = 0.1568 → total 1.3328. Close enough. So approximately 3.428. Let me compute exact fraction. 

Original values: 

y_D = 168/125 = 1.344  
x_D - x_A = (-527/250) - (-5/2) = (-527/250) + (5/2) = (-527/250) + (625/250) = 98/250 = 49/125. 

So slope m_AD = (168/125) / (49/125) ) = 168/49 = 24/7 ≈ 3.42857. 

Ah! So the slope of AD is 24/7. 

So the equation of line AD is y - 0 = (24/7)(x - (-2.5)) → y = (24/7)(x + 2.5). 

Now, we need to find the equation of line EF, which is perpendicular to AD and passes through point C(0.7, 2.4). Since EF is perpendicular to AD, its slope is the negative reciprocal of m_AD. 

m_AD = 24/7 → m_EF = -7/24. 

Equation of EF: y - 2.4 = (-7/24)(x - 0.7). 

We need to find the intersection point E between AD and EF. 

So solve the two equations:

1. y = (24/7)(x + 2.5)
2. y = (-7/24)(x - 0.7) + 2.4

Set them equal:

(24/7)(x + 2.5) = (-7/24)(x - 0.7) + 2.4

Multiply both sides by 24*7 to eliminate denominators:

24*24(x + 2.5) = -7*7(x - 0.7) + 2.4*24*7

Calculate left side: 576(x + 2.5)

Right side: -49(x - 0.7) + 336

Expand:

Left: 576x + 576*2.5 = 576x + 1440

Right: -49x + 34.3 + 336 = -49x + 370.3

So:

576x + 1440 = -49x + 370.3

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

576x + 49x = 370.3 - 1440  
625x = -1069.7  
x = -1069.7 / 625 ≈ -1.71152

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me re-express the equation precisely:

After multiplying by 24*7:

Left side: 24*24(x + 2.5) = 576(x + 2.5)  
Right side: -7*7(x - 0.7) + 2.4*24*7 = -49(x - 0.7) + 2.4*168 = -49x + 34.3 + 403.2 = -49x + 437.5

Wait, earlier I said 2.4*24*7. Let me recalculate that:

2.4 * 24 = 57.6; 57.6 * 7 = 403.2. Yes. And -49(x - 0.7) = -49x + 34.3. Adding to 403.2 gives 34.3 + 403.2 = 437.5. 

So left side: 576x + 576*2.5 = 576x + 1440  
Right side: -49x + 437.5

Then:

576x + 1440 = -49x + 437.5  
576x + 49x = 437.5 - 1440  
625x = -1002.5  
x = -1002.5 / 625 = -1.604

Wait, 1002.5 divided by 625: Let me compute that. 625*1.6 = 1000. So 1002.5 is 2.5 more than 1000. So 1.6 + (2.5/625) = 1.6 + 0.004 = 1.604. So x = -1.604. 

So x ≈ -1.604. Let me compute exact value. 

Original equation after substitution:

576x + 1440 = -49x + 437.5  
=> 576x +49x = 437.5 -1440  
=> 625x = -1002.5  
x = -1002.5 / 625  
Convert 1002.5 to fraction: 1002.5 = 10025/10 = 2005/2  
So x = -(2005/2) / 625 = -2005/(2*625) = -2005/1250 = simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 5: -401/250 ≈ -1.604. 

So x = -401/250. 

Now, plug this x into equation of AD to find y. 

Equation of AD: y = (24/7)(x + 2.5). 

Compute x + 2.5: -401/250 + 5/2 = convert 5/2 to 625/250. So total is (-401 + 625)/250 = 224/250 = 112/125. 

Then y = (24/7) * (112/125) = (24 * 112) / (7 * 125) 

Simplify: 24/7 * 112/125 = 24 * (112/7) / 125 = 24 * 16 / 125 = 384/125 = 3.072. 

So coordinates of E are (-401/250, 384/125). 

Now, we need to find the length CE. Point C is at (0.7, 2.4) which is (7/10, 12/5). Let me express 0.7 as 7/10 and 2.4 as 12/5. 

Point C: (7/10, 12/5)  
Point E: (-401/250, 384/125) 

Compute the difference in x-coordinates: Δx = (-401/250) - 7/10 = (-401/250) - (175/250) = (-576)/250 = -288/125. 

Δy = 384/125 - 12/5 = 384/125 - 300/125 = 84/125. 

Then, CE length is sqrt[(Δx)^2 + (Δy)^2]. 

Compute (Δx)^2 = (288/125)^2  
(Δy)^2 = (84/125)^2 

Sum: (288² + 84²)/125² 

Factor numerator: 288 and 84 share common factors. Let me factor 288 = 12*24, 84 = 12*7. So GCD(288,84)=12. 

But let me compute 288² + 84²:

First compute 288²: 288*288. Let me note that 288 = 24*12, 84 = 12*7. So:

(24*12)^2 + (12*7)^2 = 12²*(24² + 7²) = 144*(576 + 49) = 144*625 = 90000. 

So numerator is 90000, denominator is 125² = 15625. 

Thus, CE² = 90000 / 15625 = 90000 ÷ 15625. Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 3600 / 625. Again divide by 25: 144 / 25. So CE = sqrt(144/25) = 12/5 = 2.4. Wait, but that can’t be right. Because CE is supposed to be something else. Wait, did I make a mistake here? 

Wait, 288² + 84² = ?

Wait 288² = (280 + 8)^2 = 280² + 2*280*8 + 8² = 78400 + 4480 + 64 = 83,  78400 + 4480 = 82880 + 64 = 82944. 

84² = 7056. 

Sum is 82944 + 7056 = 90,000. Yes. So 90,000 / 15,625 = 5.76. Wait, 15,625 * 5.76 = ?

Wait 15,625 * 5 = 78,125  
15,625 * 0.76 = ? Let me compute 15,625 * 0.7 = 10,937.5 and 15,625 * 0.06 = 937.5 → total 11,875. So total is 78,125 + 11,875 = 90,000. Correct. 

So CE² = 90,000 / 15,625 = 5.76 → CE = sqrt(5.76) = 2.4. Wait, but according to this, CE is 2.4. But the options don't have 2.4 directly. Wait, the options are A:3, B:20/3≈6.666..., C:12/5=2.4, D:16/5=3.2. Oh! Option C is 12/5, which is 2.4. So that would be the answer. 

Wait, but why is CE equal to 2.4? Let me check my steps again. 

Because CE is the distance between point C(7/10, 12/5) and E(-401/250, 384/125). Calculated differences gave Δx=-288/125 and Δy=84/125, leading to CE= sqrt( (288/125)^2 + (84/125)^2 ) = sqrt( (288² + 84²)/125² ) = sqrt(90000 / 15625) = sqrt(5.76) = 2.4, which is 12/5. 

Yes, so CE = 12/5. Therefore, the answer is option C. 

But let me cross-verify with another method. Since we found CE = 12/5, which is 2.4. Given that AC is 4.0, and CE is 2.4, that seems plausible. Also, the answer choice C is 12/5. 

Another way to think: Since EF is perpendicular to AD, and E lies on AD, then triangle CEA and CED might have certain relations. But given the coordinates led us to CE=12/5, which is option C. 

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
