MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the measure of angle AOB given that AC is the diameter of circle O and angle OBC is 40 degrees. Let me start by recalling the given information and the relevant theorems.

First, the problem mentions that AC is the diameter of the circle with center O. That means points A and C are on the circumference, and O is the midpoint of AC. Also, since O is the center, OA, OB, and OC are radii of the circle. Wait, but there's also point B mentioned. The predicates say that B lies on the circle because PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(O)). So, B is another point on the same circle as A and C.

Now, looking at the triangles mentioned: Triangle(O,B,C) and Triangle(O,A,B). Both are isosceles because OA, OB, and OC are radii, so OA=OB=OC. Therefore, in triangle OBC, sides OB and OC are equal (both radii), making it isosceles with base BC. Similarly, triangle OAB has OA=OB, so it's also isosceles with base AB.

Given that angle OBC is 40 degrees. Wait, angle OBC refers to the angle at point B in triangle OBC. Since triangle OBC is isosceles with OB=OC, the base angles at B and C should be equal. But wait, the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(O,B,C)) is 40.0. Let me clarify: Angle(O,B,C) is the angle at point B between points O, B, and C. So in triangle OBC, angle at B is 40 degrees. Since it's an isosceles triangle with OB=OC, the two base angles would be at B and C. Wait, but OB and OC are the legs, so the base would be BC, making angles at B and C the base angles. However, since OB=OC, the base angles at B and C should be equal. Wait, but angle at B is given as 40 degrees, so angle at C should also be 40 degrees? Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So if angles at B and C are each 40 degrees, then angle at O would be 180 - 40 -40 = 100 degrees. So angle BOC would be 100 degrees?

But wait, the problem says that angle AOB is the one we need to find. Hmm. Let me make sure I'm interpreting the angles correctly. 

Also, there's a mention that AC is the diameter, so angle ABC would be an inscribed angle subtended by diameter AC. Wait, but point B is on the circle, so angle ABC would actually be a right angle? Wait, no. Wait, if AC is the diameter, then any point B on the circle forms a right angle with A and C. That's Thales' theorem. So angle ABC should be 90 degrees. But wait, does that apply here? Because in this case, point B is connected to A and C via lines AB and BC. Wait, the problem mentions Line(A,B) and Line(B,C), so triangle ABC is formed. But according to Thales' theorem, angle ABC should be 90 degrees. However, the problem gives us angle OBC as 40 degrees. Let me think again.

Wait, angle OBC is part of triangle OBC, not angle ABC. So angle at B between O and C. Since O is the center, and B is on the circle, OB is a radius, and BC is a chord. So triangle OBC is isosceles with OB=OC. As earlier, angles at B and C are equal. Given angle OBC is 40 degrees, so angle OCB is also 40 degrees, leading to angle BOC being 100 degrees. Then, angle BOC is 100 degrees. Now, how does this relate to angle AOB?

Since AC is the diameter, OA and OC are radii, so OA = OC. Therefore, points A, O, and C are colinear with O in the middle. So angle AOC is a straight line, meaning it's 180 degrees. But angle AOB and angle BOC are adjacent angles forming angle AOC. Wait, if O is the center, then points A, O, C are colinear, so angle AOC is 180 degrees. If we consider points A, B, and C arranged such that B is somewhere on the circle, then angles around O would depend on where B is located.

Wait, but maybe we can use the fact that OA, OB, and OC are all radii, so they have the same length. Let's denote the length of OA as r (radius). Then, OB and OC are also length r. In triangle OBC, as discussed, angles at B and C are 40 degrees each, making angle BOC 100 degrees. Now, considering triangle OAB, which is also isosceles with OA=OB=r. What's the angle at O here, which is angle AOB? That's the angle we need to find.

But how do we connect this with the other information? Maybe we can look at the entire circle and the positions of the points. Since AC is the diameter, points A and C are endpoints of the diameter. Then, point B is some point on the circle. The key might be relating angles around point O.

Alternatively, perhaps we can consider the position of point B relative to AC. For instance, if we know angle BOC is 100 degrees, then maybe we can find angle AOB by considering the total angle around point O. Wait, but around point O, the full circle is 360 degrees. However, since AC is a straight line (diameter), the angle between OA and OC is 180 degrees. Points B is somewhere on the circle, so depending on its location, angles like AOB and BOC add up to 180 degrees? Or maybe not necessarily.

Wait, if we imagine the circle with diameter AC, and point B somewhere on the upper half. Then, OA is pointing to the left, OC to the right. The angle AOB would be the angle between OA and OB, and angle BOC would be between OB and OC. Since OA and OC are opposite directions, the sum of angles AOB and BOC would be 180 degrees. So angle AOB + angle BOC = 180 degrees. We found angle BOC is 100 degrees, so angle AOB would be 180 - 100 = 80 degrees. Which would correspond to answer choice C: 80°.

But wait, let me verify this logic. Suppose angle BOC is 100 degrees. Then, since OA and OC form a straight line (angle AOC is 180 degrees), then yes, angle AOB plus angle BOC equals angle AOC. So angle AOB = 180 - angle BOC = 180 - 100 = 80 degrees. Hence, answer C.

But let me check if my assumption about angle BOC being 100 degrees is correct. Earlier, I considered triangle OBC with OB=OC, angles at B and C are 40 degrees each, leading to angle BOC being 100 degrees. Is that accurate?

Yes. In triangle OBC, since OB=OC, it's an isosceles triangle with base BC. Therefore, the base angles at B and C are equal. Given angle at B (OBC) is 40 degrees, then angle at C (OCB) is also 40 degrees. Thus, angle at O (BOC) is 180 - 40 -40 = 100 degrees. Correct.

Therefore, angle AOB is 80 degrees. So the answer should be C: 80°.
