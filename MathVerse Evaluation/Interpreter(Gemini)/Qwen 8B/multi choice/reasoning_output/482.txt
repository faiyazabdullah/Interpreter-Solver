MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, the problem mentions points A and B. From the predicates, there's a Point(A), Point(B), and they lie on the same line, Line(A,B). Also, there are some Equals statements: Equals(2,A), Equals(8,B), Equals(8,A), Equals(6,B). Wait, that seems confusing because Points are usually named with capital letters like A, B, but here they're referring to coordinates? Maybe there's a mix-up in notation. Let me check again.

Looking at the predicates, there's also Point(PointA) and Point(PointB), and Equals(PointA, 2, 8), Equals(PointB, 8, 6). Oh, so maybe PointA has coordinates (2,8) and PointB has coordinates (8,6)? That makes more sense. So the line goes through these two points. The question asks for the domain and range of each function using interval notation. Wait, functions? But we're dealing with a line in coordinate geometry. Hmm, perhaps they mean the equation of the line?

Wait, the original question says: "Write the domain and range of each function using interval notation." But if it's just a straight line, its domain and range would typically be all real numbers unless restricted. But maybe there's something else here. Wait, maybe the problem refers to the x and y values of the line? For example, the line passes through (2,8) and (8,6). So the line extends infinitely in both directions, so the domain (x-values) would be all real numbers, (-∞, ∞), and the range (y-values) also all real numbers. But maybe the question is expecting something different? Or perhaps there's confusion between a line and a function?

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the problem statement? The user mentioned "a line goes through a hollow point (2,8) and a solid point (8,6)". Maybe the term "hollow" and "solid" refers to something else, like whether the points are endpoints of a segment or part of a line? But even then, the domain and range of a line as a function... Well, a line isn't necessarily a function unless it's vertical or horizontal. Wait, but the line passing through (2,8) and (8,6) has a slope. Let me compute the slope first.

Calculating the slope between (2,8) and (8,6): m = (6-8)/(8-2) = (-2)/6 = -1/3. So the equation of the line would be y - 8 = -1/3(x - 2). Simplifying, y = -1/3 x + 2/3 + 8 → y = -1/3 x + 26/3. This is a linear function, so its domain is all real numbers since a line extends infinitely left and right. Similarly, the range is all real numbers because as x increases, y decreases without bound and vice versa. Therefore, both domain and range are (-∞, ∞). But the answer choices aren't listed here; the user said "No choices found." However, the instructions mention selecting from A-D, but since no options are given, maybe the intended answer is that both domain and range are all real numbers. But how does that translate to interval notation? It would be (-∞, ∞) for both. Since the problem didn't provide options, but the user's answer choices are missing, perhaps the correct answer is that the domain and range are all real numbers. But since the user wants the answer as one of A-D, but there are no options, maybe the system expects a default answer. Wait, looking back, the initial prompt says "Answer Choices: No choices found." So maybe the answer is supposed to be written directly. However, according to the instructions, the assistant must choose between A-D. But since there are no choices, perhaps the answer is that there are no valid choices, but the user's instructions require choosing one. This is confusing. Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in the problem setup. Given that the problem involves a line through two points, the domain and range of the line as a function are both all real numbers. Hence, the answer should be that the domain and range are (-∞, ∞). But since the user hasn't provided options, perhaps the answer is not among the choices. However, the user's last instruction says to pick from A-D. Without seeing the actual choices, it's impossible to know. But since the user included "No choices found," maybe the correct answer is none of the above, but the system requires selecting one. In such cases, sometimes the answer is 'None' but since that's not an option here, perhaps the intended answer is A, assuming that the options were meant to have this. But this is speculative. Given the ambiguity, but following the problem's structure, the answer would be that both domain and range are all real numbers, so in interval notation, (-∞, ∞). Therefore, if forced to choose between A-D, perhaps the answer is A, but without knowing the actual options, this is uncertain. However, since the problem may have had options where A was (-∞, ∞) for both, the answer would be A. So I'll go with Final Answer: A.
