MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have AB parallel to CD, and a transversal EF intersecting them at points E and F respectively. Angle 1 is given as 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 2. 

First, I'll recall some basics about parallel lines and transversals. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, several pairs of angles are formed. There are corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, consecutive interior angles, and so on. Since AB is parallel to CD, the transversal EF creates these angle relationships.

Now, looking at the given information: angle 1 is 50 degrees. Let me visualize this. Suppose AB and CD are horizontal lines, and EF is a slanting line crossing them. Point E is where EF meets AB, and point F is where it meets CD. So, angle 1 is likely one of the angles formed at either E or F. Wait, the problem mentions angle 1 and angle 2. But how exactly are they positioned?

The predicates mention IntersectAt(Line(E,F), Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Point(E)) and similarly for Point(F). That suggests that line EF intersects AB at E and CD at F. Also, Parallel(Line(A,B), Line(C,D)). So, AB || CD, and EF is a transversal.

Now, angle 1 is measured as 50 degrees. The question is, where is angle 1 located? Typically, in such problems, angles formed by the transversal with the parallel lines could be corresponding or alternate. Let me think. If angle 1 is at point E on line AB, then depending on which side, it could be corresponding to an angle at F on CD. Alternatively, if angle 1 is at point F, then maybe it's an alternate interior angle with another angle on AB.

Wait, but the problem says angle 1 = 50.0. So, perhaps angle 1 is one of the angles formed at E or F. Let me consider the standard cases. For example, if angle 1 is at E, between AB and EF, then its corresponding angle at F would be equal because of the parallel lines. However, if angle 1 is an interior angle, then the consecutive interior angles would be supplementary. Wait, but without knowing exactly where angle 1 is, it's a bit ambiguous. But maybe there's more info in the predicates.

Looking back at the predicates: PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,B)) means that point E is on AB. Similarly, PointF lies on CD. Also, IntersectAt(Line(E,F), Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Point(E)) implies that EF crosses AB at E and CD at F. So, EF is the transversal cutting AB at E and CD at F. Therefore, angles at E and F are formed by EF with AB and CD.

So, considering the diagram, angle 1 is probably one of the angles at E or F. Let's assume angle 1 is at point E. Then, since AB || CD, the corresponding angle at F would be equal. However, angle 2 might be another angle, like a vertical angle or an adjacent angle. Alternatively, if angle 1 is an interior angle, then the consecutive interior angles would add up to 180 degrees.

Wait, let me clarify. Let's say EF is a transversal. At point E, where EF meets AB, there are two angles: one on one side of EF, and another on the other side. Similarly at point F. Now, since AB || CD, the corresponding angles are equal. So, if angle 1 is a corresponding angle to angle 2, then they would be equal. But if angle 1 is an interior angle, then the consecutive interior angle (same-side interior) would be supplementary.

But the problem states angle 1 = 50 degrees. Let's suppose angle 1 is an interior angle. Then the consecutive interior angle would be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. However, angle 2 could be that consecutive interior angle. But wait, maybe angle 2 is the exterior angle. Let me draw this mentally.

Imagine AB and CD as horizontal lines, EF as a diagonal line going from bottom left to top right. So, at point E (on AB), the angle between AB and EF upwards would be angle 1. Then, moving to point F (on CD), the angle between CD and EF downwards would be a corresponding angle, hence equal to angle 1. However, if angle 1 is on one side, then the other angles around E and F would depend on their position.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle with angle 2. Wait, but alternate interior angles are equal. However, if angle 1 is on one side of the transversal, then the alternate interior angle would be on the opposite side of the transversal. But since AB and CD are parallel, those angles would be equal. However, if angle 1 is 50 degrees, then angle 2 could also be 50 degrees, making answer A. But that seems too straightforward. However, sometimes diagrams can be tricky. 

Wait, but the problem says angle 1 and angle 2. Maybe angle 1 is one of the angles formed at E, and angle 2 is at F. But if they are corresponding angles, they are equal. But if they are same-side interior angles, they sum to 180. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify where angle 1 and angle 2 are located. Hmm. This is a common ambiguity in such problems. 

Wait, looking back at the given predicates: there's MeasureOf(Angle(1)) equals 50.0. So angle 1 is given. The question asks for angle 2. Without seeing the diagram, it's a bit challenging, but often in such problems, angle 1 and angle 2 are consecutive interior angles. Or maybe angle 1 is an exterior angle and angle 2 is an interior angle.

Let me try to think again. Since AB is parallel to CD, and EF is a transversal. Let's imagine that angle 1 is at point E, between AB and EF. Then, the angle adjacent to angle 1 at point E would be supplementary to it (since they form a linear pair). So, that would be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. Now, if angle 2 is the corresponding angle at point F, then it would be equal to angle 1, so 50 degrees. But if angle 2 is the consecutive interior angle, then it would be 130 degrees. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 is at point F, then the same logic applies. Wait, but the problem says angle 1 is 50 degrees. Let's suppose angle 1 is an exterior angle. For instance, if EF is cutting AB at E, forming an angle outside the parallel lines. Wait, but depending on the direction of EF, the angles can vary. 

Another approach: In such configurations, when a transversal cuts two parallel lines, the sum of consecutive interior angles is 180 degrees. If angle 1 is one of those, then angle 2 (the consecutive interior angle) would be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. So angle 2 would be 130 degrees. Looking at the options, C is 130. But wait, why isn't angle 2 being considered here?

Alternatively, angle 1 could be an alternate interior angle with angle 2. If that's the case, they'd be equal. But since angle 1 is 50, angle 2 would be 50. But that's option A. But I need to figure out which scenario applies.

Wait, the problem mentions that EF intersects AB at E and CD at F. So, the angles formed at E and F are on different sides. Let me try to label them. At point E, where EF meets AB, there are two angles: one on one side of EF, and another on the other side. Similarly at F. 

Assuming that angle 1 is at point E, between AB and EF, then the corresponding angle at F would be the angle between CD and EF on the same side. Those would be equal. But if angle 2 is the other angle at F, then it would be supplementary to the corresponding angle. Wait, but how does this relate?

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle with angle 2. For example, if angle 1 is inside the parallel lines, on one side of the transversal, and angle 2 is inside on the other side. Then they are equal. But again, depends on positioning.

But without the diagram, it's hard to know. However, in many standard problems, when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, the consecutive interior angles (also called same-side interior angles) are supplementary. So, if angle 1 is one of them, then angle 2 is the other, adding up to 180. Hence, angle 2 would be 130 degrees. Which is option C.

But why would angle 1 be a consecutive interior angle? Because if EF is the transversal, then the angles on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines are consecutive interior angles. So, if angle 1 is one of those, then angle 2 is the other. Hence, 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. That would make angle 2 130 degrees. So answer C.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle, then angle 2 would be equal. But if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle, then angle 2 would be equal. But in that case, angle 2 would be 50 degrees. But the answer choices have A as 50, which is possible. But how do I decide which scenario is correct?

Wait, the problem says angle 1 is 50 degrees. If angle 1 is an alternate interior angle, then angle 2 would be equal to it. But if angle 1 is a corresponding angle, then angle 2 would be equal. But if angle 1 is a consecutive interior angle, then angle 2 would be supplementary. 

But how to determine which one angle 1 is. The problem mentions that angle 1 and angle 2 are present. Perhaps angle 1 and angle 2 are consecutive interior angles. For example, if angle 1 is on one side of the transversal, and angle 2 is on the other side, but inside the parallel lines. Wait, but consecutive interior angles are on the same side of the transversal.

Wait, maybe the key is in the way the points are labeled. The predicates mention IntersectAt(Line(E,F), Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Point(E)) and similarly for Point(F). So, EF intersects AB at E and CD at F. So, EF is passing through E (on AB) and F (on CD). So, the angles formed at E and F are on the same transversal.

Now, considering the angles formed at E: when EF crosses AB at E, it forms two angles. One is between AB and EF, going towards the direction of CD. The other is the supplementary angle. Similarly at F. 

If angle 1 is the angle at E between AB and EF (say, the angle above AB), then the corresponding angle at F would be the angle between CD and EF (above CD), which would be equal to angle 1 due to parallel lines. However, if angle 2 is the angle at F between CD and EF on the other side (the angle below CD), then that angle would be supplementary to the corresponding angle. Wait, but angle 2 could be that supplementary angle.

Alternatively, angle 1 might be an exterior angle. For example, if angle 1 is the angle at E on the side away from CD, then it would correspond to an angle at F on the same side, which would be equal. But again, without the diagram, it's ambiguous.

But in many standardized problems, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, and one angle is given, the other angle could be found via the properties. Given that angle 1 is 50 degrees, and assuming it's a consecutive interior angle, then angle 2 would be 130 degrees. That aligns with option C.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is an alternate interior angle with angle 2, then angle 2 would be 50 degrees (option A). But why would that be the case? It depends on where angle 2 is located.

Wait, the problem statement may imply that angle 1 and angle 2 are vertically opposite angles or something else. Another possibility is that angle 1 is an exterior angle and angle 2 is a remote interior angle, but that usually involves triangles.

Wait, maybe the diagram shows that EF is a transversal creating vertical angles. For instance, at point E, angle 1 is formed, and at point F, angle 2 is formed. If angle 1 and angle 2 are vertical angles, then they would be equal. But that's unlikely unless specified.

Alternatively, angle 1 is an exterior angle, and angle 2 is the adjacent interior angle. For example, at point E, angle 1 is an exterior angle, and angle 2 is the interior angle adjacent to it. Then, they would be supplementary. So, angle 2 would be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. Again, leading to option C.

Given that angle 1 is 50 degrees, and assuming it's an exterior angle, then the adjacent interior angle (angle 2) would be 130 degrees. That makes sense. 

Therefore, based on the typical scenarios involving parallel lines and transversals, angle 2 is likely 130 degrees. So, the answer should be C.
