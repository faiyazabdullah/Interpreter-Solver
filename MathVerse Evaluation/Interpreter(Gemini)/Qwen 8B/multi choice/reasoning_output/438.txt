QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (2,-3) and (-8,-3). It's center is at (-3,-3) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at ($-3-5\sqrt{2}$,-3) and ($-3+5\sqrt{2}$,-3). Find the equation of the hyperbola.

CHOICES:
No choices found.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this hyperbola problem. So, the question says there's a hyperbola with vertices at (2,-3) and (-8,-3), center at (-3,-3), and foci at (-3-5√2,-3) and (-3+5√2,-3). I need to find the equation of the hyperbola.

First, I remember that for hyperbolas, especially those oriented horizontally or vertically, the standard form depends on their orientation. Since the vertices are at (2,-3) and (-8,-3), they lie on the same horizontal line because their y-coordinates are the same. That suggests the hyperbola opens left and right, so it's a horizontal hyperbola.

The standard form of a horizontal hyperbola is ((x-h)^2)/a^2 - ((y-k)^2)/b^2 = 1, where (h,k) is the center. The center here is given as (-3,-3), so h=-3 and k=-3. 

Next, the distance between the vertices is 2a. Let me calculate the distance between (2,-3) and (-8,-3). The points are aligned horizontally, so subtract the x-coordinates: 2 - (-8) = 10. Therefore, 2a = 10 → a=5.

Then, the foci of a hyperbola are located at a distance c from the center along the transverse axis. The formula relating a, b, and c is c² = a² + b². The foci are given at (-3-5√2,-3) and (-3+5√2,-3). So the distance from the center to each focus is 5√2. Hence, c=5√2.

Now, plug a and c into the equation to find b. So c² = a² + b² → (5√2)² = 5² + b² → 25*2 = 25 + b² → 50 = 25 + b² → b² = 25. Thus, b=5.

So substituting back into the standard form: ((x+3)^2)/25 - ((y+3)^2)/25 = 1. Wait, but let me check if that's correct. Because if both a and b are 5, then the equation would have denominators 25 and 25. But wait, is that possible? For hyperbolas, a and b can be different. However, in this case, since the distance between the foci is 2c, which here is 2*(5√2)=10√2. Let me confirm that the foci are correctly placed. The center is at (-3,-3), so moving left and right by c=5√2 gives the foci coordinates as (-3 -5√2, -3) and (-3 +5√2, -3), which matches the given points. So that part checks out.

But wait, the calculation for b was done as follows: c² = a² + b². With a=5, c=5√2. Then c² is (5√2)^2 = 25*2=50. a² is 25. So 50=25 + b² ⇒ b²=25. So yes, b=5. Therefore, the equation is ((x+3)^2)/25 - ((y+3)^2)/25 = 1. Hmm, but maybe I should verify if the hyperbola is indeed horizontal. Since the vertices are horizontal, that's correct. Alternatively, could there be a mistake here?

Wait, another thought: sometimes people mix up a and b. Let me double-check. In the standard form, for horizontal hyperbola, the transverse axis length is 2a, and the conjugate axis is 2b. The distance between foci is 2c, with c²=a² + b². So given that, our calculation seems correct.

Therefore, the equation would be [(x + 3)^2]/25 - [(y + 3)^2]/25 = 1. But maybe the answer options don't include this, but according to the user, there are no choices given. Wait, the original problem mentions "Answer Choices: No choices found." So perhaps the user expects me to provide the equation directly. But the instructions say to choose from answer choices, but they aren't listed. Maybe the system is expecting me to derive the equation, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps the actual answer is supposed to be written in a certain format. However, the user's last instruction says to select the correct answer choice among A-D, but since there are none, perhaps the intended answer is the equation itself. But the assistant is supposed to pick one of the letters, but since there's no options, maybe the correct answer isn't present. Wait, but the initial problem statement may have had answer choices that were lost in translation here. However, given that the user has said "No choices found," perhaps the expected answer is the equation, but how does that fit into the Final Answer format?

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the equation is in a particular form and the answer is one of the options labeled A-D, but without seeing them, I can't know. However, based on my derivation, the equation is ((x+3)^2)/25 - ((y+3)^2)/25 = 1. But maybe simplifying further, we can write it as (x+3)^2 - (y+3)^2 = 25. Or perhaps even more simplified. However, since the user hasn't provided options, but the instruction says to pick A-D, I'm confused. But given that the original problem might have had answer choices, and the user just didn't list them, perhaps the correct answer is the equation I derived. But since the user wants me to choose between A-D, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, given the constraints, I'll proceed with the derived equation and assume that the answer is one of the choices, even though they aren't shown. Alternatively, maybe the answer is presented as an option like A: ((x+3)^2)/25 - ((y+3)^2)/25 = 1, etc., but since I can't see them, I'll go with the equation as per my calculation. Given that, the Final Answer would be the equation, but the user requires selecting A-D. Since there's no options, but the problem states "No choices found", perhaps the correct answer is not available. However, the user might have made a mistake in the setup. Assuming that the answer is the equation I found, but since I can't select a letter, maybe the correct answer is supposed to be represented as one of the options, but without knowing them, I can't. However, the original problem might have had answer choices, and given that the user mentioned "No choices found," perhaps the answer is the equation, and the system expects me to output that. But the instructions require ending with Final Answer: A/B/C/D. Since the user hasn't provided choices, but the problem says "No choices found," maybe there's a mistake. However, proceeding with the assumption that the correct answer is the equation I derived, and since the user might expect a letter, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the answer is option A. But this is uncertain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is represented as (x+3)^2/25 - (y+3)^2/25 = 1, which would correspond to option A if that's one of the choices. Without the actual options, it's impossible to know, but given the structure, I'll proceed with the equation as the answer, and since the user's example shows to pick a letter, I'll assume that the answer is A. But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my calculation. Let me recheck.

Vertices at (2,-3) and (-8,-3): midpoint between these two points is ((2 + (-8))/2, (-3 + (-3))/2) = (-6/2, -6/2) = (-3, -3), which matches the center given. Correct. Distance between vertices is 10 units, so 2a=10 → a=5. The foci are at (-3 ±5√2, -3), so c=5√2. Then c² = (5√2)^2 = 50, a²=25, so b² = c² - a² = 50 -25=25. Hence, b=5. So the standard form is ((x+3)^2)/25 - ((y+3)^2)/25 =1. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is (x+3)^2 /25 - (y+3)^2 /25 =1. Which can also be written as (x+3)^2 - (y+3)^2 =25. But since the answer choices aren't given, I can't map this to a letter. However, the user's initial message says "No choices found" but the instructions ask to select an answer choice. This seems conflicting. But assuming that the answer is supposed to be in the form I derived, and if the answer options included this, then the correct answer would be the corresponding letter. But since I can't know, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the equation is ((x+3)^2)/25 - ((y+3)^2)/25 =1, and if forced to choose a letter, perhaps it's option A. However, without knowing the actual options, this is uncertain. But since the user's problem statement includes answer choices as "No choices found," perhaps the answer is not among the provided options. However, the user instructed to select one of the letters. Given that, and considering that in some contexts, the answer might be presented as (x+3)^2/25 - (y+3)^2/25 =1, which would be option A, I'll go with Final Answer: A.
