MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a circle O with points A, B, and C on it. Angle AOB is given as 50 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle ACB, which is an inscribed angle. 

First, I remember that in a circle, the central angle is twice the inscribed angle that subtends the same arc. Since angle AOB is a central angle, it should be twice the inscribed angle ACB. Wait, but angle ACB is at point C, so the arc AB would be subtended by both the central angle AOB and the inscribed angle ACB. 

So if angle AOB is 50 degrees, then the inscribed angle ACB should be half of that. That would make angle ACB 25 degrees. Let me double-check. Central angle is indeed twice the inscribed angle for the same arc. Therefore, 50 divided by 2 is 25. So the answer should be B, 25 degrees. 

But wait, is there anything else? The problem mentions points A, B, C on the circle, and lines OA, OB, OC as radii. So triangle OAB is isosceles because OA and OB are radii. But maybe that's not directly relevant here. The key thing is the relationship between central and inscribed angles. 

Yes, angle ACB is an inscribed angle over arc AB. The central angle over the same arc is 50 degrees, so the inscribed angle is half. Therefore, 25 degrees. That matches answer choice B.
