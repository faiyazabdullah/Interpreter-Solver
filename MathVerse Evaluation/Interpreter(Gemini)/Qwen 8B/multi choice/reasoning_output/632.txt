MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the first maximum point of the function y = cos(x + 45°) for x ≥ 0. The original cosine function y = cos(x) has its first maximum at (0°, 1). Now, we need to consider the transformation applied here.

First, I recall that the general form of a cosine function with a horizontal shift is y = cos(x - h), where h is the phase shift. But in our case, it's y = cos(x + 45°), which can also be written as y = cos(x - (-45°)). This means there's a horizontal shift of -45°, so the graph is shifted to the left by 45 degrees. 

Wait, but how does shifting affect the maximum points? For the standard cosine function, the maxima occur at x = 0°, 360°, 720°, etc. When we shift the graph left by 45°, each maximum point would also shift left by 45°. Therefore, the first maximum after x ≥ 0 would be at x = 0° - 45° = -45°, but since we're only considering x ≥ 0, this point is outside our domain. So, the next maximum would be at x = 360° - 45° = 315°, right?

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The original maximum is at x=0. After shifting left by 45°, the new maximum would be at x = -45°, which isn't in our domain. Then the next maximum would be the next one in the original function shifted. Since the period of cosine is 360°, shifting left by 45°, the next maximum would be at x = 360° - 45° = 315°, because adding the period to the shifted position. Wait, maybe another way: the maximum occurs where the argument of the cosine is 0° plus multiples of 360°. So for y = cos(x + 45°), set x + 45° = 0° + 360°k, where k is integer. Solving for x gives x = -45° + 360°k. We want x ≥ 0. The smallest such x is when k=1: x = -45° + 360° = 315°. So the first maximum point in x ≥ 0 is at x=315°, y=1. Therefore, the coordinates are (315°, 1).

But wait, the answer options weren't given here. However, according to the problem statement, the user mentioned that the answer choices were "No choices found," but the actual answer should be determined. Since the problem says to choose from A-D, but in the initial prompt, the answer choices are not listed. However, based on the process, the answer should be (315°, 1). But if the options included this, then that would be the answer. Since the user hasn't provided options, perhaps they expect us to just state the answer as per the calculation. However, the instructions say to select from answer choices, but in the problem description, the answer choices are missing. Wait, looking back, the user wrote "Answer Choices: No choices found." That suggests there are no answer choices provided, but the system expects us to provide the answer as per the process. But the user said "state the coordinates of the first maximum point...". Given that, the correct answer is (315°, 1). But since the original problem mentions the answer choices aren't present, perhaps the user intended to have the assistant provide the answer directly. However, the instructions require selecting from A-D. But without seeing the answer choices, it's impossible. Wait, maybe the answer is supposed to be (45°, 0)? No, that's not right. Let me confirm once more.

Original maximum at x=0. Shift left by 45°, so the first maximum in x≥0 would be at x=-45°, which is not allowed. Next maximum would be the next peak after shifting. Since the period is 360°, the next peak after x=-45° is x=-45° + 360° = 315°, which is within x≥0. Hence, the first maximum point is (315°, 1). Therefore, the coordinates are (315°, 1).
