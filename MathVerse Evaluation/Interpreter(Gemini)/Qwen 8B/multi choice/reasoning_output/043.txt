MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

We have points A, B, C, D, and O. Lines OA, OB, OC, OD are mentioned, along with lines AB and DC. There are triangles OAB and ODC, which are congruent. Also, there are some angle measures given: Angle AOD is 30 degrees, Angle AOC is 100 degrees. Additionally, it's stated that angle AOB equals angle DOC, and since triangle OAB is rotated 30 degrees to get ODC, maybe there's some rotational symmetry here. Point D lies on AB, which adds another constraint.

Wait, the problem says triangle ODC is obtained by rotating triangle OAB clockwise around O by 30 degrees. So rotation implies that corresponding parts should be congruent and angles preserved. Since rotation preserves angles and distances, OA=OD, OB=OC because they're radii of the same rotation. That aligns with the given Equals(LengthOf(OA), LengthOf(OD)) and Equals(LengthOf(OB), LengthOf(OC)). 

Now, the measure of angle AOD is 30 degrees. Since the rotation is 30 degrees, that angle would correspond to the angle between OA and OD. Similarly, angle BOC would be the same as angle AOD? Wait, but angle AOD is given as 30 degrees. But also, there's an equality between MeasureOf(Angle(AOD)) and MeasureOf(Angle(BOC)), so angle BOC is also 30 degrees. 

Then, the measure of angle AOC is 100 degrees. Let me think about how these angles relate. Since OA and OB are sides of triangle OAB, angle AOB is part of that triangle. Similarly, angle DOC corresponds to angle AOB because of the rotation. Also, angle AOC is given as 100 degrees. How does that fit?

Let me try to visualize the diagram. Points A and B are connected by line AB, and point D is on AB. Triangle OAB is rotated 30 degrees around O to get ODC. So, point D is the image of point A under rotation, and point C is the image of point B. Therefore, OD = OA and OC = OB. 

Since D is on AB, the position of D depends on where A is rotated. Let's consider the angles. The original angle AOB is equal to angle DOC because of the rotation. Let's denote angle AOB as x. Then angle DOC is also x. 

But we know angle AOD is 30 degrees. Since OA is rotated to OD, the angle between OA and OD is 30 degrees. So angle AOD = 30°, which is the rotation angle. Now, considering point D lies on AB. So AB is a line containing points A, D, B. 

Also, angle AOC is given as 100 degrees. Let's see. Point C is the image of B after rotation. So, OC = OB, and angle BOC is 30 degrees (as per the equality). Wait, earlier we had that angle BOC equals angle AOD, which is 30°, so that checks out. 

So angle AOC is formed by points A, O, C. Let's break down angle AOC. From point O, angle between OA and OC. Since OC is the image of OB after rotation by 30°, so the direction of OC is 30° from OB. But how does that relate to OA?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that angle AOC is composed of other angles. For example, angle AOC could be angle AOD + angle DOC. Wait, if D is on AB, then maybe we can express angle AOC as angle AOD plus angle DOC? Let me check.

If we imagine OA going to A, then rotating it 30° gives OD. Then, OC is the rotated version of OB. Since angle AOD is 30°, and angle DOC is equal to angle AOB (because of rotation), then angle AOC would be angle AOD + angle DOC. Wait, but angle AOC is given as 100°, so substituting:

angle AOC = angle AOD + angle DOC → 100° = 30° + angle DOC → angle DOC = 70°? Wait, but earlier we thought angle DOC was equal to angle AOB. Wait, but angle AOB is equal to angle DOC. So angle AOB = angle DOC. So if angle DOC is 70°, then angle AOB is 70°. 

But wait, let's re-examine. If angle AOD is 30°, and angle DOC is equal to angle AOB (from the congruence of triangles OAB and ODC?), but wait, the triangles are congruent. So triangle OAB ≅ triangle ODC. Therefore, corresponding angles are equal. So angle OAB corresponds to angle ODC, angle OBA corresponds to angle OCD, and angle AOB corresponds to angle DOC. Therefore, angle AOB = angle DOC. 

So angle DOC = angle AOB. And angle AOC is angle AOD + angle DOC? Or maybe angle AOC is angle AOD + angle DOC? Let me think about the arrangement. 

OA is one side, OD is 30° away from OA. Then, OC is such that angle DOC is equal to angle AOB. But where is point C located? Since triangle ODC is a rotation of OAB, so point C is the image of B. Therefore, the direction from O to C is the direction of OB rotated by 30° clockwise. So angle between OB and OC is 30°, making angle BOC = 30°, as given. 

But angle AOC is the total angle from OA to OC. To find angle AOC, we can think of it as the sum of angle AOD (30°) and angle DOC (which is equal to angle AOB). But angle AOB is the original angle at O in triangle OAB. However, we also know that angle AOC is given as 100°, so:

angle AOC = angle AOD + angle DOC  
→ 100° = 30° + angle DOC  
→ angle DOC = 70°  

But angle DOC is equal to angle AOB, so angle AOB = 70°. 

Now, we need to find angle DOB. Let's consider angle DOB. This is the angle at O between points D and B. 

To find angle DOB, let's look at the entire configuration. We know several angles around point O. 

First, angle AOD is 30°, angle BOC is 30°, and angle AOB is 70°. 

Additionally, since D lies on AB, the line AB contains points A, D, B. So, the position of D divides AB into segments AD and DB. 

Now, angle DOB can be found by considering the angles around O. Let's consider the full circle around point O. The angles around O add up to 360°. 

But we need to focus on the relevant angles. Let's consider the angles at O involving points A, B, C, D. 

From the given, we have:

- angle AOD = 30°
- angle BOC = 30°
- angle AOB = 70°
- angle DOC = 70° (since angle DOC = angle AOB)

Now, what about angle AOC? It's given as 100°, which we've already used. Also, angle AOC can be expressed as angle AOD + angle DOC (30° + 70° = 100°), which checks out. 

Now, angle DOB is the angle between OD and OB. Let's see how to calculate that. 

Looking at the angles around O, starting from OA, moving through OD (30°), then to OC (which is 70° from OD?), but perhaps we need to find the relationship between OD and OB. 

Alternatively, consider the positions of the points. Since D is on AB, and AB is a straight line. Let's think about the angles involving D. 

Another approach: Since OA is rotated to OD by 30°, and OB is rotated to OC by 30°, then the direction of OC is OB rotated 30° clockwise. So, the angle between OB and OC is 30°, which is angle BOC = 30°. 

Now, angle DOB is the angle between OD and OB. To find this, we can consider the total angle from OD to OB. 

Let me try to map out the angles around point O. Starting from OA, rotating 30° gets us to OD. Then, from OD, we need to go to OB. What's the angle between OD and OB?

Alternatively, consider that angle AOB is 70°, which is the angle between OA and OB. Since OD is 30° from OA, then the angle between OD and OB would be angle AOB minus angle AOD. 

Wait, angle AOB is 70°, angle AOD is 30°, so the remaining angle from OD to OB would be 70° - 30° = 40°. Therefore, angle DOB is 40°. 

But let me verify this. Imagine OA is pointing in some direction. Rotating OA 30° clockwise gives OD. The angle between OA and OB is 70°, so if OD is 30° from OA, then the angle between OD and OB would be 70° - 30° = 40°, assuming that OB is beyond OA in the same direction. But is that accurate?

Yes, because angle AOB is between OA and OB. If OD is 30° from OA towards OB, then the angle between OD and OB is angle AOB - angle AOD = 70° - 30° = 40°. Hence, angle DOB is 40°, which would be answer A. 

But let me cross-check with other methods. Another way: the sum of angles around point O. Suppose we consider all the angles created by the lines OA, OB, OC, OD. 

We know:

- angle AOD = 30°
- angle BOC = 30°
- angle AOB = 70°
- angle DOC = 70°

What about the rest? For instance, angle COB is 30°, angle AOC is 100°, angle AOD is 30°, angle DOC is 70°, angle AOB is 70°, angle BOC is 30°. 

If we consider the full circle around O, the sum of all angles around O should be 360°. But perhaps we don't need that. Alternatively, looking at the angles between different pairs. 

Alternatively, since D is on AB, the line AB passes through D. So, the line AB has points A, D, B in order. Thus, angle ADB is a straight line. 

But focusing back on angles at O. Let me think again. The angle between OD and OB is angle DOB. 

Since OA rotates to OD by 30°, and OB rotates to OC by 30°, then the direction of OC is OB rotated 30° clockwise. So, the vector from O to C is OB rotated 30° clockwise. 

Therefore, the angle between OB and OC is 30°, which is angle BOC = 30°. 

But how does that relate to angle DOB? 

Imagine that from point O, we have four rays: OA, OD, OB, and OC. We know:

- OD is 30° from OA.
- OC is 30° from OB.
- The angle between OA and OB is 70°, so angle AOB = 70°.
- The angle between OB and OC is 30°, so angle BOC = 30°.
- The angle between OD and OC is angle DOC = 70° (since triangle OAB ≅ ODC, so angle DOC = angle AOB = 70°).

Now, to find angle DOB, which is the angle between OD and OB. 

Let me think of the angles around O. If we start from OA, rotate 30° to OD. Then, from OD, to reach OB, we need to cover the angle between OD and OB. 

Alternatively, since OA and OB form a 70° angle, and OD is 30° from OA, then the angle between OD and OB is 70° - 30° = 40°, as previously thought. 

This seems consistent. Therefore, angle DOB is 40°, so the answer should be A. 

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Suppose OA is horizontal, pointing to the right. Rotate OA 30° clockwise to get OD. Then, angle between OA and OD is 30°. The angle between OA and OB is 70°, so OB is 70° from OA. Then, the angle between OD and OB would be 70° - 30° = 40°, yes. 

Thus, the answer is 40°, which corresponds to choice A.
