Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and visualize the figure. 

We have points A, B, C, D forming a quadrilateral ABCD. There's a point O inside this quadrilateral such that OA = OB = OC. Also, angles at ABC and ADC are both 65 degrees. Additionally, O lies on the lines AB, BC, CD, and DA. Wait, that seems conflicting because if O is on those lines, how can it be inside the quadrilateral? Maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, the predicates say PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(A,B)), same for B,C; C,D; D,A. So O is on all four sides of the quadrilateral? That would mean O is the intersection point of all these lines, but a quadrilateral's sides don't intersect except at vertices. Unless the quadrilateral is self-intersecting, but typically, unless specified, we assume convex quadrilaterals. Hmm, maybe O is the center where all these lines meet? But how?

Alternatively, perhaps O is the intersection point of the diagonals? But the diagonals of a quadrilateral usually intersect at one point. However, the given conditions state O lies on each side. Wait, that doesn't make sense unless the quadrilateral is degenerate. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says O is a point in the quadrilateral ABCD. Then, lines OA, OB, OC are given, implying O is connected to each vertex. Also, O lies on the lines AB, BC, CD, DA. That suggests that O is a common point on all four sides. For example, if O is on AB, BC, CD, DA, then it's like O is the intersection point of AB, BC, CD, DA. But in a standard quadrilateral, two adjacent sides share a vertex, so their intersection is the vertex. But if O is on all four sides, it must coincide with all vertices, which isn't possible unless the quadrilateral is collapsed. This seems contradictory. Perhaps there's a misinterpretation here.

Wait, maybe the lines mentioned aren't the sides of the quadrilateral but other lines. Wait, looking back: Line(A,B) is one side, Line(B,C) next, Line(C,D), Line(D,A). So those are the sides of the quadrilateral. Then, O lies on each of these lines. Therefore, O must be the intersection point of all four sides. Which is only possible if all sides pass through O. That would mean that the quadrilateral has all its sides passing through O, making it a star-shaped quadrilateral or something. But normally, a quadrilateral has four sides, each connecting two vertices. If O is on each side, then each side passes through O. That implies that O is a point where all four sides meet, which would require the quadrilateral to be degenerate. For instance, imagine a bowtie shape, but even then, the sides don't all pass through a single interior point. Alternatively, maybe O is the center of some kind of symmetry.

But another possibility is that O is the center of a circle passing through A, B, C, D, but since OA=OB=OC, but OD isn't mentioned. However, the problem states OA=OB=OC, but not OD. Wait, the given equalities are LengthOf(OA)=LengthOf(OB) and LengthOf(OB)=LengthOf(OC). So OA=OB=OC, but OD could be different. Also, O lies on lines AB, BC, CD, DA. So O is on AB, meaning it's somewhere along AB. Similarly, on BC, CD, DA. So O is the common point of all four sides. How is this possible?

Let me think differently. Suppose ABCD is a quadrilateral with O being a point inside such that OA=OB=OC, and O lies on each side. Wait, but if O is on AB, then OA is part of AB. Similarly, O is on BC, so OB is part of BC. But OA and OB would be segments from O to A and O to B. If O is on AB, then OA is a segment from O to A, and OB would be from O to B. But since O is on AB, then OA + OB = AB. But also, OA = OB. So OA = OB implies that O is the midpoint of AB. But then O is the midpoint of AB, but also lies on BC, CD, DA. That seems impossible unless ABCD is a specific type of quadrilateral.

Wait, maybe O is the intersection of the diagonals? In a typical quadrilateral, diagonals AC and BD intersect at O. But according to the given, O lies on AB, BC, CD, DA. So O would have to lie on AB, BC, CD, DA. That's only possible if O is a common point of all four sides. But in a normal quadrilateral, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. The only way for a single point O to lie on all four sides is if the quadrilateral is degenerate, like all sides overlapping at O. But that's not possible unless the quadrilateral is collapsed. 

This contradiction suggests that perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem. Let me check again the given predicates. 

The problem says: Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D). So ABCD is a quadrilateral. Then, Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A) are the sides. Then, PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(A,B)) means O is on AB. Similarly for the others. So O is on AB, BC, CD, DA. Thus, O is the common point of all four sides. Which implies that all four sides pass through O. Hence, O is the intersection point of AB, BC, CD, DA. 

In a non-degenerate quadrilateral, this is only possible if the quadrilateral is self-intersecting, like a bowtie. But even then, the sides would cross at O, but each side would pass through O. For example, consider a self-intersecting quadrilateral where all sides pass through O. But how does that work?

Alternatively, maybe O is the origin of a coordinate system, and the quadrilateral is constructed around it. But without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Given that OA=OB=OC, and O is on AB, BC, CD, DA. Let me try to sketch mentally. Since O is on AB, then OA is part of AB. Let's suppose O is the midpoint of AB. Then OA=OB. But O is also on BC, so moving from B to C, O is somewhere on BC. But if O is already the midpoint of AB, then it's a different position. So unless AB and BC are arranged such that their midpoints align. 

This seems too vague. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's focus on the angles given: Angle ABC and ADC are both 65 degrees. And we need to find angle DAO + angle DCO. 

Since O is on AB, BC, CD, DA, perhaps considering triangles involving O. For example, Triangle(A,O,B) and Triangle(B,O,C) are given. Since OA=OB, Triangle AOB is isoceles with OA=OB. Similarly, OB=OC, so Triangle BOC is also isoceles. 

Also, angles at ABC and ADC are 65 degrees. Let's note that angle ABC is the angle at B between AB and BC. Since O is on AB and BC, then angle ABC is formed by BA and BC. But since O is on AB and BC, perhaps angle ABC relates to angles in triangles involving O. 

Similarly for angle ADC, which is the angle at D between DC and DA. Since O is on DC and DA, that angle is formed by DC and DA. 

Maybe using the fact that OA=OB=OC and the angles at B and D are 65 degrees. Also, considering the sum of angles around point O. 

Alternatively, since O is on all four sides, maybe considering the cyclic nature. Wait, if OA=OB=OC, and O is on AB, BC, CD, DA, then perhaps constructing triangles and using the Law of Sines or Cosines. 

Another thought: Since O lies on AB, BC, CD, DA, then AB, BC, CD, DA are all passing through O. So, for example, AB is a straight line passing through O, as is BC, CD, DA. This suggests that O is the intersection point of all four sides, which would imply that the quadrilateral is made up of two triangles overlapping at O. 

For example, imagine AB and CD intersecting at O, and BC and DA intersecting at O. But in that case, the quadrilateral would be a complete quadrilateral, with O as the intersection point of the diagonals. Wait, but in a complete quadrilateral, there are three diagonals, but here we have four sides. 

Alternatively, considering that O is the intersection point of AB and CD, and also BC and DA. But that would require AB and CD to intersect at O, and BC and DA to intersect at O as well. Which would make O the intersection point of the two diagonals AC and BD. Wait, but then O would be the intersection of the diagonals. However, the given condition says O is on AB, BC, CD, DA. So if O is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD, then O lies on AC and BD, not necessarily on AB, BC, CD, DA. So that contradicts the given. 

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the key is that O is equidistant from A, B, C, but not D. Given OA=OB=OC, and O is on AB, BC, CD, DA. 

Let me try to think about coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Suppose O is at the origin (0,0). Since O is on AB, BC, CD, DA. Let me define AB as a line passing through O. Let’s assume AB is horizontal for simplicity. Let’s set O at (0,0). Let’s take point A at (-a, 0) and B at (b, 0) for some positive a,b. Since O is on AB, which is the x-axis. Now, since O lies on BC, which is another line. Let's say BC goes from B(b,0) to C. Since O is on BC, then C must be such that the line BC passes through (0,0). So parametrize BC: starting at B(b,0), going through O(0,0), then extending to C. Let’s say vector from B to O is (-b, 0), so direction vector is (-b,0). So parametric equation of BC is (b - bt, 0) where t >=0. When t=1, it reaches O. To find C, we can choose t >1. Let's say t=2, so C would be at (b - 2b, 0) = (-b, 0). Wait, but that would place C at (-b, 0), which is same as A if A was at (-a,0). Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe BC is vertical? No, since O is on BC. Let me think again. If O is on BC, then BC passes through O. So coordinates of B is (b,0), O is (0,0). So line BC connects B(b,0) to some C. Let's pick C as (c_x, c_y) such that line BC passes through O. So the line BC goes from B(b,0) through O(0,0) to C. So the parametric form of BC can be written as (b - b*t, 0) where t=0 gives B, t=1 gives O, and t>1 gives beyond O. So for some parameter t>1, C would be at (b - b*t, 0). Wait, but then C would be on the x-axis, same as A and B, making ABCD collapse. Not good. 

This suggests that my assumption of AB being horizontal may not work. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that O is the origin, and OA=OB=OC=r. So A, B, C are points at distance r from O. Since O is on AB, which is a line passing through O. So AB is a line passing through O, and A and B are on opposite sides of O. Similarly, since O is on BC, then B and C are on a line passing through O. Wait, but B is already on AB and BC. So BC is a line passing through B and O. So C is on the line BO extended. Similarly, O is on CD, so C and D are colinear with O. And O is on DA, so D and A are colinear with O. 

So this forms a structure where each pair of consecutive points (A,B), (B,C), (C,D), (D,A) are colinear with O. So the lines AB, BC, CD, DA all pass through O. Thus, the quadrilateral ABCD is formed by four lines passing through O, with each consecutive pair connected. 

This setup resembles a complete quadrilateral with O as the intersection point of the lines AB, BC, CD, DA. Wait, but in a complete quadrilateral, there are four lines, and three diagonals. But here, the lines are AB, BC, CD, DA. So the lines AB and CD intersect at O, and lines BC and DA intersect at O. Thus, O is the intersection of AB and CD, and also of BC and DA. This is the case for a complete quadrilateral, where O is the diagonal point. 

Now, with this configuration, the quadrilateral ABCD is actually a complete quadrilateral with O as the intersection point of its two diagonals. However, in this case, ABCD is not a simple quadrilateral but a self-intersecting one. 

Given that OA=OB=OC, and O is the intersection point of AB, BC, CD, DA. Also, angles at B and D are 65 degrees. Need to find angle DAO + angle DCO. 

Let me try to model this. Let me denote OA=OB=OC=r. Since O is on AB, then OA and OB are parts of AB. Let me assume AB is a line passing through O, with A and B on opposite sides of O. Similarly, BC passes through O, so B and C are on opposite sides of O. Similarly for CD and DA. 

Thus, points are arranged as follows: 

- A and B are on line AB, with O between them (since OA=OB).
- B and C are on line BC, with O between them (since OB=OC).
- C and D are on line CD, with O between them (since OC=OD? Wait, no. The given is OA=OB=OC, but not OD. So OD is not necessarily equal to OA. So C and D are on line CD, but O is on CD. So if O is between C and D, then OC is part of CD, and OD is the other part. But since OA=OB=OC, but not OD, so OD can be different. 

Wait, but the problem says PointLiesOnLine(O, Line(C,D)). So O is on CD. So CD is a line passing through O. So points C and D are on either side of O. But since OC is given as equal to OA and OB, but OD is not specified. So OC is fixed, but OD can vary. 

Now, angles at B and D are given. Angle ABC is 65 degrees. Let's analyze angle ABC. At point B, between points A, B, C. Since B is on line BC (which passes through O) and line AB (also passing through O). So angle ABC is formed by BA and BC. Since O is on AB and BC, then BA is from B to A (opposite direction of BO), and BC is from B to C (opposite direction of BO). So vectors BA and BC are in directions away from B. 

Since O is on AB and BC, then BA is from B to A, which is towards A (on the line AB), and BC is from B to C, which is towards C (on line BC). Given that OA=OB, and OB=OC. 

Let me consider triangle OAB. Since OA=OB, it's an isoceles triangle with base AB and equal sides OA and OB. Wait, but O is on AB. So OA and OB are parts of AB. If O is between A and B, then OA + OB = AB. But OA=OB, so AB = 2*OA. 

Similarly, for triangle OBC, since OB=OC, and O is between B and C. So OB = OC, hence BC = 2*OB. 

Same for OCD: since O is on CD, and OC=OD? No, OC is given, but not OD. Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(O,A),LengthOf(O,B)) and Equals(LengthOf(O,B),LengthOf(O,C)), so OA=OB=OC. So OC is the length from O to C, and since O is on CD, then OD is the remaining part. 

Now, angle ABC is the angle at B between BA and BC. Since BA is from B to A (along AB), and BC is from B to C (along BC). Because O is on AB and BC, we can relate these vectors. 

Let me consider vectors. Let’s take point B. From B, BA goes toward A (which is on the line AB), and BC goes toward C (on line BC). Since O is on AB and BC, the direction of BA is from B to A (away from O), and BC is from B to C (away from O). 

Because OA = OB, and O is on AB, then OA = OB = r. So AB = OA + OB = 2r. Similarly, BC = OB + OC = r + r = 2r. So AB = BC = 2r. 

Now, angle ABC is 65 degrees. In triangle ABC, but wait, ABC is a triangle? Or is it just the angle at B. Since ABC is the angle at B between AB and BC. 

Given that AB and BC are both length 2r, but the angle between them is 65 degrees. Wait, but AB and BC are not necessarily sides of a triangle. Wait, ABC is a triangle? Yes, points A, B, C form triangle ABC. But with AB = 2r, BC = 2r, and angle at B is 65 degrees. So triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = BC = 2r and angle at B is 65 degrees. 

Wait, but AB and BC are sides of the triangle, so yes. So triangle ABC has AB = BC = 2r, and angle at B is 65 degrees. Then, we can compute other angles or sides. 

Similarly, angle ADC is 65 degrees. Let's look at triangle ADC. Points D, A, C. AD and DC are sides. Since O is on DA and DC. DA is from D to A, passing through O. DC is from D to C, passing through O. 

Assuming similar logic: since O is on DA, and OA = r (from earlier, OA = OB = OC = r). Wait, OA is the length from O to A. If DA is a line passing through O, then OD is the length from O to D. So DA = OD + OA = OD + r. Similarly, DC is from D to C, passing through O. OC = r, so DC = OD + OC = OD + r. 

Therefore, DA = DC = OD + r. So DA = DC. So triangle DAC has DA = DC, making it isoceles with DA = DC, and angle at D is 65 degrees. 

Now, the goal is to find angle DAO + angle DCO. Let's break this down. 

Angle DAO is the angle at A between DA and AO. Similarly, angle DCO is the angle at C between DC and CO. 

Let me consider triangle DAO. Point D, A, O. DA is a line from D to A passing through O. AO is from A to O. So angle DAO is the angle at A between DA and AO. Similarly, angle DCO is at C between DC and CO. 

To find these angles, maybe we can use triangle properties or coordinate geometry. Let me try coordinate geometry. 

Let me place point O at the origin (0,0). Since OA = OB = OC = r, let's assign coordinates accordingly. 

First, consider line AB passing through O. Let's set AB horizontally for simplicity. Let me set point O at (0,0). Let me choose coordinates so that A is at (-a, 0), and B is at (a, 0), so that OA = OB = a. Then AB has length 2a. 

Next, consider line BC passing through O. Since B is at (a,0), and O is at (0,0). So line BC goes from B(a,0) through O(0,0) to C. Since OB = OC = a, then OC = a. Since O is between B and C, C should be located at (-a, 0)? Wait, no. Because OB is from O to B, which is a vector from O(0,0) to B(a,0). To have OC = OB = a, point C should be located such that the distance from O to C is a. But since O is on BC, and B is at (a,0), then line BC extends from B through O to C. 

Vector from B to O is (-a, 0). To get point C such that OC = a, we extend from B through O by the same length as BO. Since BO has length a, then OC should also be length a. So from O(0,0), moving in the same direction as from B to O (which is left along the x-axis), we go from O(0,0) to C(-a, 0). Wait, but then C would be at (-a,0), which is the same as point A. That's not possible. 

Ah, here's the issue. If OA = OB = OC, and O is on AB, BC, CD, DA, then placing A at (-a,0), B at (a,0), and C at (-a,0) causes overlap. So this suggests that my initial coordinate assignment is flawed. 

Alternative approach: Let me consider that line BC passes through O, but not aligned with AB. Let me assign coordinates more carefully. 

Let me place O at (0,0). Let me define AB as a line passing through O. Let me take AB as the x-axis, with A at (-1,0) and B at (1,0), so OA = OB = 1. Now, line BC passes through O. Let me define point C such that OC = 1. Let me choose coordinates for C such that line BC passes through O. 

Since B is at (1,0), and O is at (0,0), the line BC goes from B(1,0) through O(0,0) to C. To ensure OC = 1, point C should be in the direction opposite to B from O. So from O(0,0), in the direction opposite to B, which is negative x-axis. Wait, but then C would be at (-k, 0) such that OC = k = 1. So C is at (-1, 0). But that coincides with A, which is at (-1,0). Again, conflict. 

So this suggests that if AB is along x-axis with A(-1,0), B(1,0), and O at (0,0), then line BC passing through O with OC = 1 would put C at (-1,0), which is same as A. Hence, not working. 

Therefore, line BC cannot be collinear with AB. Hence, I need to choose a different orientation for BC. 

Let me instead make line BC not aligned with AB. Let me define line BC as passing through O(0,0) and B(1,0). Let me choose point C such that OC = 1, but not on the x-axis. For example, let me choose C at (0,1). Wait, but then line BC would be from B(1,0) to C(0,1), passing through O(0,0)? No, because the line from B(1,0) to C(0,1) has slope (1-0)/(0-1) = -1. Does this line pass through O(0,0)? Plugging x=0, y=0: the line equation is y = -x + 1. At x=0, y=1, not 0. So O is not on this line. 

To have O on line BC, the line BC must pass through (0,0). So given B(1,0), and O(0,0), the line BC is the line joining B(1,0) and O(0,0), extended to C. So C would be on the line BO extended beyond O. So direction from B to O is (-1,0), so extending past O, point C would be at (-k, 0) for some k. To have OC = 1, since O is at (0,0), the distance from O to C is |OC| = sqrt((-k)^2 + 0^2) = k. So set k = 1, giving C at (-1,0). But this is the same as A, which is at (-1,0). Again, collision. 

This indicates that with AB along x-axis and O at (0,0), choosing C on line BO results in C coinciding with A. Hence, this configuration is invalid. 

Perhaps I need to choose a different coordinate system where AB and BC are not aligned. Let me try assigning coordinates differently. Let me set O at (0,0). Let me choose AB as a line passing through O, but not horizontal. Let me set A at (-1,0) and B at (1,0), as before. Now, line BC must pass through O. Let me define point C such that line BC passes through O and OC = 1. Let me choose a direction for line BC not aligned with AB. For example, let me choose line BC to be in the direction of (0,1). So from B(1,0), the line BC goes through O(0,0) and extends to C. 

Parametrize line BC: starting at B(1,0), passing through O(0,0), and extending. The parametric equations can be expressed as x = 1 - t, y = 0, for t ≥ 0. When t=1, we reach O(0,0). To find C, we need to extend beyond O. Let me choose t=2, so x=1-2=-1, y=0. So point C would be at (-1,0), which is same as A. Again, collision. 

No matter how I choose the direction, if I fix AB and O, then OC would force C to coincide with A. This suggests that the only way for OA=OB=OC with O lying on AB and BC is if points A, B, C are arranged such that they're on different lines through O, not collinear. 

Wait, but the problem states that O lies on all four sides: AB, BC, CD, DA. So each consecutive pair of points defines a line passing through O. So AB, BC, CD, DA are all lines passing through O. Hence, the quadrilateral is formed by four lines through O, with each consecutive pair of points on successive lines. 

This forms a star-like shape, with O as the center. Each line passes through O, and the quadrilateral is formed by connecting A to B, B to C, C to D, D to A. 

In this scenario, the points are arranged such that each consecutive pair is on a line passing through O. So, for example, A and B are on line AB through O; B and C are on line BC through O; C and D on line CD through O; D and A on line DA through O. 

With this setup, the quadrilateral ABCD is made up of four lines through O, and the points are placed such that each line passes through O. 

Now, OA=OB=OC=r. Let me assign coordinates with O at (0,0). Let me define:

- Line AB: let me take A at (-a, 0), B at (b, 0), with O at (0,0). So OA = a, OB = b. Given OA=OB, so a = b. Let me set a = b = r. So A(-r, 0), B(r, 0).

- Line BC: passes through B(r,0) and O(0,0). So line BC is the x-axis. But wait, that would make points B and C on the x-axis, with O at (0,0). So point C would be on the x-axis. Let me choose C at (-s, 0), so that OC = s. Given that OC = OB = r, so s = r. Hence, C is at (-r, 0), which is the same as A. Conflict again! 

Again, this leads to C coinciding with A. This suggests that if AB and BC are both on the same line (the x-axis), then C would overlap with A. Hence, this implies that lines AB and BC must be different lines through O. 

So, line AB is one line through O, and line BC is another line through O. Hence, AB and BC are two distinct lines passing through O. 

Let me redefine. Let me have line AB as the x-axis, with A(-r,0), B(r,0). Line BC is another line through O, say the y-axis. So point C is on the y-axis. Since OB = r, and line BC passes through O, then from B(r,0), line BC goes through O(0,0) and extends to C. To have OC = r, since O is at (0,0), point C should be at (0, r) or (0,-r). Let me choose C at (0,r). Then OC = r, satisfying OC = OB = r. 

Now, line CD must pass through O. Since C is at (0,r), and D is a point such that line CD passes through O. So line CD connects C(0,r) to D, passing through O(0,0). So D is on the line extending from C(0,r) through O(0,0). Let me choose D such that OD = ?. Since OA=OB=OC=r, but OD is not specified. Let me choose D at (0,-d), so that line CD is from C(0,r) through O(0,0) to D(0,-d). Then, OC = r, and OD = d. 

Finally, line DA must pass through O. Since D is at (0,-d) and A is at (-r,0), line DA connects D(0,-d) to A(-r,0) and must pass through O(0,0). Let me verify if this is true. 

Equation of line DA: passing through D(0,-d) and A(-r,0). The slope is (0 - (-d))/(-r - 0) = d / (-r) = -d/r. Equation: y - (-d) = -d/r (x - 0), so y + d = -d/r x → y = -d/r x - d. Does this line pass through O(0,0)? Plug x=0: y = -d. Not zero unless d=0, which is invalid. So this line does not pass through O. Hence, our assumption is wrong. 

To satisfy line DA passing through O, the line DA must pass through O(0,0). So points D, A, and O are colinear. Given D is on line CD (which is the y-axis), and A is at (-r,0). So for line DA to pass through O(0,0), D must be such that O lies on DA. 

Since A is at (-r,0) and D is on line CD (y-axis), let me find D such that O(0,0) lies on DA. 

Let me parametrize line DA: it passes through A(-r,0) and D, which is on y-axis. Let me denote D as (0, k). Then, line DA connects (-r,0) and (0,k). The equation of this line is y = [(k-0)/(0 - (-r))]x + 0 → y = (k/r)x. For O(0,0) to lie on this line, plugging x=0 gives y=0, which it does. So regardless of k, line DA passes through O. Great! 

So D is at (0,k). Now, since line CD passes through O, and C is at (0,r), D is at (0,k). Line CD connects C(0,r) to D(0,k), which is the vertical line x=0. So this satisfies that O is on CD. 

Now, we need to ensure that angle ABC and angle ADC are both 65 degrees. Let's calculate angle ABC first. 

Point B is at (r,0). Angle ABC is the angle at B between points A, B, C. Points A(-r,0), B(r,0), C(0,r). 

Vector BA is from B to A: A - B = (-r - r, 0 - 0) = (-2r, 0). Vector BC is from B to C: C - B = (0 - r, r - 0) = (-r, r). 

The angle between vectors BA and BC is angle ABC. Let's compute this angle using dot product. 

BA • BC = (-2r)(-r) + (0)(r) = 2r² + 0 = 2r². 

Magnitude of BA: sqrt((-2r)^2 + 0^2) = 2r. 

Magnitude of BC: sqrt((-r)^2 + r^2) = sqrt(2r²) = r√2. 

So cos(theta) = (2r²) / (2r * r√2) ) = 2r² / (2r²√2) = 1/√2. Hence theta = 45 degrees. But the given angle ABC is 65 degrees. Contradiction. 

This suggests that with this configuration, angle ABC is 45 degrees, not 65. Hence, this setup is incorrect. 

Where is the error? The problem states angle ABC is 65 degrees, but in this setup, it's 45. So I need to adjust parameters. 

Perhaps the coordinates need adjustment. Let me consider that angle ABC is 65 degrees. Let me recalculate with variables. 

Let me keep A(-r,0), B(r,0), C(0,c), where c is some value. Then vector BA is (-2r, 0), vector BC is (-r, c). 

Dot product: (-2r)(-r) + 0*c = 2r². 

|BA| = 2r, |BC| = sqrt(r² + c²). 

So cos(theta) = 2r² / (2r * sqrt(r² + c²)) ) = r / sqrt(r² + c²). 

Set this equal to cos(65°):

r / sqrt(r² + c²) = cos(65°)

Square both sides:

r² / (r² + c²) = cos²(65°)

=> r² = cos²(65°)(r² + c²)

=> r² = r² cos²(65°) + c² cos²(665°)

Wait, let me rearrange:

r² = cos²(65°)*r² + c² cos²(65°)

=> r² (1 - cos²(65°)) = c² cos²(65°)

=> r² sin²(65°) = c² cos²(65°)

=> (r/c)^2 = cot²(65°)

=> r/c = cot(65°)

=> c = r tan(65°)

So c = r tan(65°). Let me compute tan(65°). Approximately, tan(65°) ≈ 2.1445. So c ≈ 2.1445r. 

Thus, point C is at (0, 2.1445r). 

Now, with this setup, angle ABC is 65 degrees. Good. 

Now, let's move to angle ADC, which is 65 degrees. Point D is at (0,k), as before. Let me find k such that angle ADC is 65 degrees. 

Point D is at (0,k), point A is at (-r,0), point C is at (0, c) = (0, 2.1445r). 

Angle ADC is the angle at D between points A, D, C. 

Vectors DA and DC. 

DA is from D to A: A - D = (-r - 0, 0 - k) = (-r, -k). 

DC is from D to C: C - D = (0 - 0, c - k) = (0, c - k). 

The angle between vectors DA and DC is angle ADC. 

Compute the dot product:

DA • DC = (-r)(0) + (-k)(c - k) = 0 -k(c - k) = -kc + k². 

Magnitude of DA: sqrt(r² + k²). 

Magnitude of DC: sqrt(0² + (c - k)^2) = |c - k|. 

So cos(theta) = (-kc + k²) / [sqrt(r² + k²) * |c - k|]. 

Since angle ADC is 65 degrees, this equals cos(65°). 

Let me simplify the expression. Assume c > k (so c - k is positive). 

Then, numerator: -kc + k² = k(k - c). 

Denominator: sqrt(r² + k²) * (c - k). 

So cos(theta) = [k(k - c)] / [sqrt(r² + k²)(c - k)] = -k / sqrt(r² + k²). 

Thus, cos(theta) = -k / sqrt(r² + k²). 

But theta is 65 degrees, so:

-k / sqrt(r² + k²) = cos(65°). 

However, cosine is positive for acute angles (0-90 degrees), but here the left side is negative, implying theta is obtuse. But angle ADC is given as 65 degrees, which is acute. This is a contradiction. 

What went wrong? Perhaps my assumption about the direction of vectors. Let me recheck. 

Angle ADC is at D, between A-D-C. So vectors DA and DC start at D. 

Vector DA is from D to A: A - D = (-r, -k). 

Vector DC is from D to C: C - D = (0, c - k). 

The angle between these vectors is computed as above. But if the cosine comes out negative, it suggests that the angle is obtuse, but the problem states it's 65 degrees. This implies inconsistency. 

Possible reasons: 

1. My assumption about the location of D is incorrect. 

2. The sign in the calculation. 

Let me reconsider the angle. Maybe I should use vectors from D to A and D to C. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the absolute value. Let me re-express. 

cos(theta) = [DA • DC] / (|DA| |DC|) = [ -kc + k² ] / [ sqrt(r² + k²) * |c - k| ] 

But if angle is 65 degrees, cos(theta) should be positive. Hence, the numerator must be positive. 

Thus, -kc + k² > 0 => k² > kc => k > c (assuming k > 0). 

But earlier, I assumed c > k to have c - k positive. If k > c, then c - k is negative, so denominator becomes sqrt(...) * (k - c). 

So let me redo with k > c. 

Then, c - k = -(k - c), so denominator is sqrt(r² + k²)*(k - c). 

Numerator: -kc + k² = k(k - c). 

Thus, cos(theta) = [k(k - c)] / [sqrt(r² + k²)(k - c)] = k / sqrt(r² + k²). 

Thus, cos(theta) = k / sqrt(r² + k²) = cos(65°). 

So:

k / sqrt(r² + k²) = cos(65°)

Square both sides:

k² / (r² + k²) = cos²(65°)

=> k² = r² cos²(65°) + k² cos²(65°)

=> k² (1 - cos²(65°)) = r² cos²(65°)

=> k² sin²(65°) = r² cos²(65°)

=> (k/r)^2 = cot²(65°)

=> k/r = cot(65°)

=> k = r cot(65°)

cot(65°) = 1/tan(65°) ≈ 1/2.1445 ≈ 0.4663. 

So k ≈ 0.4663r. 

Thus, point D is at (0, 0.4663r). 

Now, with this, angle ADC is 65 degrees. Great. 

Now, we have all points defined:

- A(-r, 0)

- B(r, 0)

- C(0, c) = (0, r tan(65°)) ≈ (0, 2.1445r)

- D(0, k) = (0, r cot(65°)) ≈ (0, 0.4663r)

Now, we need to find angle DAO + angle DCO. 

Let's first find angle DAO. This is the angle at A between D-A-O. 

Point D is (0, k), A is (-r, 0), O is (0,0). 

So vectors AD and AO. Wait, angle DAO is at A, between D-A-O. 

Vector AD is from A to D: D - A = (0 - (-r), k - 0) = (r, k). 

Vector AO is from A to O: O - A = (0 - (-r), 0 - 0) = (r, 0). 

So angle between vectors AD and AO at point A. 

Compute this angle using dot product. 

AD • AO = (r)(r) + (k)(0) = r². 

|AD| = sqrt(r² + k²)

|AO| = sqrt(r² + 0) = r 

Thus, cos(theta) = r² / [sqrt(r² + k²) * r] = r / sqrt(r² + k²) = same as earlier expression. 

Which we know is equal to cos(65°), since earlier we had k = r cot(65°), so:

r / sqrt(r² + k²) = r / sqrt(r² + r² cot²(65°)) = r / [r sqrt(1 + cot²(65°))] = 1 / sqrt(1 + cot²(65°)) = 1 / csc(65°) = sin(65°). 

Wait, because 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ. So this becomes sin(65°). Hence, cos(theta) = sin(65°), which means theta = 90° - 65° = 25°. 

Wait, because cos(theta) = sin(65°) = cos(90° - 65°) = cos(25°). Hence, theta = 25°. So angle DAO is 25 degrees. 

Now, let's compute angle DCO. This is the angle at C between D-C-O. 

Point D(0, k), C(0, c), O(0,0). 

Vectors CD and CO. Wait, angle DCO is at C between D-C-O. 

Vector CD is from C to D: D - C = (0 - 0, k - c) = (0, k - c). 

Vector CO is from C to O: O - C = (0 - 0, 0 - c) = (0, -c). 

So angle between vectors CD and CO at point C. 

These vectors are (0, k - c) and (0, -c). Both are vertical vectors. 

Vector CD is (0, k - c), pointing downward if k < c (which it is, since k = r cot(65°) ≈ 0.4663r and c = r tan(65°) ≈ 2.1445r, so k < c). 

Vector CO is (0, -c), pointing downward. 

The angle between two vertical vectors depends on their directions. Since both are vertical, the angle between them is 0° if they are in the same direction, or 180° otherwise. 

Wait, but vector CD is (0, k - c) = (0, negative number), since k < c. So it's pointing downward. Vector CO is also pointing downward. So the angle between them is 0°, but that can't be right. What's wrong here?

Wait, let me recheck. 

At point C, vectors CD and CO. 

CD is from C to D: D - C = (0, k - c). 

CO is from C to O: O - C = (0 - 0, 0 - c) = (0, -c). 

Both vectors are along the y-axis. Since k < c, vector CD is (0, negative) and vector CO is (0, negative). Hence, they are in the same direction. Thus, angle between them is 0°, which contradicts the problem's requirement. 

Clearly, there's a mistake here. What did I do wrong? 

Ah, angle DCO is the angle at C between D-C-O. So vectors are CD and CO, but perhaps I should consider vectors CD and CC? No, it's angle at C, so vectors are CD and CO. 

Wait, but if both vectors are along the same line, the angle is 0°, which is impossible. This suggests an error in the setup. 

Wait, let's double-check the coordinates. 

Point C is at (0, c) = (0, r tan(65°)). Point D is at (0, k) = (0, r cot(65°)). O is at (0,0). 

So vector CD is from C to D: D - C = (0 - 0, k - c) = (0, k - c). 

Vector CO is from C to O: O - C = (0 - 0, 0 - c) = (0, -c). 

So both vectors are along the y-axis. Since k < c, vector CD is (0, negative), and vector CO is (0, negative). Hence, they are in the same direction. So angle DCO is 0°, which is impossible. 

This suggests a fundamental flaw in the setup. Where is the mistake? 

Ah! I think I mixed up the vectors. The angle at C between D-C-O should involve vectors CD and CO. But CD is from C to D, and CO is from C to O. These are both vectors originating at C. 

But since both are along the same line (the y-axis), the angle between them is indeed 0°, which suggests that points D, C, O are colinear, which they are. Hence, angle DCO is 0°, which can't be. This indicates that my entire approach is incorrect. 

This suggests that the previous assumptions about the placement of points are leading to contradictions. Perhaps the error lies in assuming that line DA passes through O, but in reality, with the current setup, it does. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires a different configuration. Let me try to think geometrically. 

Given that O is inside the quadrilateral, and OA=OB=OC, with O on all four sides. This suggests that O is the intersection of the diagonals of a kite or some symmetric figure. 

But given the angles at B and D are both 65°, and needing to find the sum of angles at A and C, perhaps there's a symmetry or property I'm missing. 

Let me recall that in such configurations, sometimes the sum of certain angles can be found via properties of isosceles triangles or cyclic quadrilaterals. 

Alternatively, since OA=OB=OC, and angles at B and D are 65°, perhaps using triangle properties. 

Let me consider triangles ABO, BCO, CDO, etc. 

In triangle ABO, OA=OB, so it's isoceles with base AB. Angle at B is part of angle ABC = 65°. 

Similarly, in triangle BCO, OB=OC, so it's isoceles with base BC. Angle at B is part of angle ABC = 65°. 

Wait, but how does this help? 

Let me try to find angles in these triangles. 

In triangle ABO: OA = OB, so angles at A and B are equal. Let's call them α. The third angle at O is 180° - 2α. 

But angle at B in triangle ABO is part of angle ABC = 65°. Let me see: angle ABC is composed of angle between AB and BC. Since O is on AB and BC, angle ABC is the angle between BA and BC, which includes the angle at B in triangle ABO and possibly others. 

Wait, in triangle ABO, the angle at B is between BA and BO. Since O is on BC, BO is part of BC. So the angle at B in triangle ABO is the same as the angle between BA and BC, which is angle ABC = 65°. 

Wait, no. Because in triangle ABO, the angle at B is between BA and BO. Since BO is part of BC, then angle ABO is part of angle ABC. Hence, angle ABO = angle ABC = 65°. But in triangle ABO, since it's isoceles with OA=OB, the base angles are at A and B. Wait, no: in triangle ABO, sides OA and OB are equal, so the base is AB, and the equal sides are OA and OB. Hence, the base angles are at A and B. 

Wait, no. In an isoceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Here, OA=OB, so the angles opposite them are at B and A respectively. Wait, OA is opposite angle at B, and OB is opposite angle at A. Wait, no: in triangle ABO, side OA is opposite angle at B, and side OB is opposite angle at A. Since OA=OB, then angles at B and A are equal. 

Thus, in triangle ABO, angles at A and B are equal. Let's denote them as β. Then, angle at O is 180° - 2β. 

But angle at B in triangle ABO is β, and this is part of angle ABC = 65°. Hence, β = 65°? No, because angle ABC is the full angle at B between BA and BC, while β is the angle between BA and BO. Since O is on BC, then angle ABC = β + ... ? Wait, no. If O is on BC, then BO is a segment from B to O on BC. Hence, angle between BA and BC is the same as angle between BA and BO, since BO is part of BC. Hence, angle ABC = angle ABO = β = 65°. 

Thus, in triangle ABO, angles at A and B are 65°, so angle at O is 180 - 2*65 = 50°. 

Similarly, in triangle BCO, since OB=OC, it is isoceles with OB=OC. Angles at B and C are equal. Let's call them γ. The angle at O is 180 - 2γ. 

But angle at B in triangle BCO is part of angle ABC? No, angle ABC is already accounted for in triangle ABO. Wait, angle at B in triangle BCO is the angle between BO and BC. But since O is on BC, this angle is 0°, which doesn't make sense. 

Wait, this suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong. Let me clarify: 

Triangle BCO has sides OB and OC, with OB=OC. The angle at B is between BO and BC. But since O is on BC, BO is part of BC, so the angle at B in triangle BCO is 0°, which is impossible. Hence, this indicates a mistake. 

The error arises because O is on BC, so triangle BCO is degenerate. This suggests that my earlier approach is flawed. 

Perhaps the problem requires a different method, such as considering the total sum of angles around O or using the fact that the sum of certain angles equals 180°. 

Let me try a new approach, focusing on the angles around point O. 

Since O is on all four sides, the lines AB, BC, CD, DA all pass through O. Thus, the quadrilateral is formed by four lines through O, creating a star shape. 

Let me consider the angles at O. 

Each pair of consecutive lines (AB, BC, CD, DA) meet at O. Let's denote the angles between these lines. 

For example, between AB and BC, there is an angle at O, and similarly for other consecutive lines. 

But how does this relate to the given angles at B and D? 

Alternatively, since OA=OB=OC, and O is on AB, BC, CD, DA, perhaps considering triangles AOB, BOC, COD, DOA. 

In triangle AOB, OA=OB, so it is isoceles. Similarly, BOC is isoceles with OB=OC. 

Let me denote the angles at O in these triangles. 

In triangle AOB, angles at A and B are equal. Let's call them α. The angle at O is 180 - 2α. 

In triangle BOC, angles at B and C are equal. Let's call them β. The angle at O is 180 - 2β. 

Similarly, in triangle COD, angles at C and D are equal, let's say γ, and angle at O is 180 - 2γ. 

In triangle DOA, angles at D and A are equal, let's say δ, and angle at O is 180 - 2δ. 

Now, the sum of all angles around point O is 360°. So:

(180 - 2α) + (180 - 2β) + (180 - 2γ) + (180 - 2δ) = 360° 

Simplifying:

720 - 2(α + β + γ + δ) = 360 

→ 2(α + β + γ + δ) = 360 

→ α + β + γ + δ = 180° 

Now, let's relate these angles to the given angles at B and D. 

Angle at B is angle ABC = 65°. This angle is composed of parts from triangles AOB and BOC. 

From triangle AOB, angle at B is α. From triangle BOC, angle at B is β. But wait, in triangle BOC, the angle at B is part of the angle ABC? No, because O is on BC, so the angle at B in triangle BOC is zero, as previously noted. Hence, this approach might not work. 

Alternatively, the angle at B (ABC) is formed by BA and BC. Since O is on BC, this angle is the same as the angle between BA and BO, which is α (from triangle AOB). Hence, α = 65°. 

Similarly, angle ADC is 65°, which is formed by DA and DC. Since O is on DA and DC, this angle is the same as the angle between DA and DO, which is δ (from triangle DOA). Hence, δ = 65°. 

So, α = 65°, δ = 65°. 

Now, from the earlier equation: α + β + γ + δ = 180° 

Substituting α = 65°, δ = 65°: 

65 + β + γ + 65 = 180 → β + γ = 50° 

Now, what about β and γ? 

In triangle BOC, which is isoceles with OB=OC, the base angles at B and C are β and γ? Wait, no. In triangle BOC, sides OB and OC are equal, so the base is BC, and the equal sides are OB and OC. Hence, the base angles are at B and C. Wait, no: in triangle BOC, the sides OB and OC are equal, so the angles opposite them are at C and B, respectively. Wait, side OB is opposite angle at C, and side OC is opposite angle at B. Since OB=OC, then angle at C = angle at B. So β = γ. 

Hence, β = γ, and β + γ = 50° → 2β = 50° → β = 25°, γ = 25°. 

Now, let's consider the angles at A and C. 

In triangle AOB, angle at A is α = 65°. 

In triangle DOA, angle at A is δ = 65°. Wait, no. In triangle DOA, angles at D and A are equal. Wait, earlier I said δ is the angle at A in triangle DOA. But let me clarify. 

In triangle DOA, sides OD and OA are equal? No, OA is given as equal to OB and OC, but OD is not specified. So triangle DOA has sides OD and OA? No, triangle DOA has sides OD, OA, and DA. But unless OD = OA, which is not given. Hence, my earlier assumption that triangle DOA is isoceles is incorrect. 

Ah, here's the mistake. Earlier, I assumed that triangle DOA is isoceles because of OA = OB = OC, but OD is not necessarily equal to OA. Hence, my previous reasoning about δ is incorrect. 

This suggests that the earlier approach needs revision. Let me start over. 

Given that OA = OB = OC, but OD is unspecified. 

In triangle AOB, OA = OB, so it is isoceles with base AB and equal sides OA and OB. Hence, angles at A and B are equal. Let's call them α. The angle at O is 180 - 2α. 

Similarly, in triangle BOC, OB = OC, so it is isoceles with equal sides OB and OC, and base BC. Hence, angles at B and C are equal. Let's call them β. Angle at O is 180 - 2β. 

Now, angle ABC is the angle at B between AB and BC. This angle is composed of the angle between BA and BO (which is α from triangle AOB) and the angle between BO and BC. But since O is on BC, the angle between BO and BC is zero. Wait, no. Since O is on BC, the line BC passes through O, so the angle between BO and BC is zero. Hence, angle ABC is equal to α, which is 65°. So α = 65°. 

Similarly, angle ADC is the angle at D between DA and DC. Since O is on DA and DC, this angle is the angle between DA and DO (let's call it γ) and between DO and DC. But since O is on DC, the angle between DO and DC is zero. Hence, angle ADC is equal to γ, which is 65°. 

Now, let's consider the angles around point O. 

The angles at O from the four triangles: 

- In triangle AOB: angle at O is 180 - 2α = 180 - 130 = 50°. 

- In triangle BOC: angle at O is 180 - 2β. 

- In triangle COD: since OC = OD? No, OC is given, but OD is not specified. So unless OD = OC, which is not stated, we can't assume. Hence, this approach is incomplete. 

This indicates that without knowing OD, it's difficult to proceed. 

But the problem asks for angle DAO + angle DCO. Let me think about these angles. 

Angle DAO is the angle at A between DA and AO. 

Angle DCO is the angle at C between DC and CO. 

Let me consider triangle DAO. It has sides DA, AO, and DO. We know OA = r, but DO is unknown. 

Similarly, triangle DCO has sides DC, CO, and DO. CO = r, but DC is unknown. 

However, since O is on DA and DC, we can express DA and DC in terms of DO and OA, OC. 

For example, DA = DO + OA (if O is between D and A), and DC = DO + OC (if O is between D and C). 

Assuming O is between D and A, and between C and D (since O is on CD). 

Let me assume that O is between D and A, and between C and D. 

So DA = DO + OA, and DC = DO + OC. 

Since OA = OC = r, then DA = DO + r and DC = DO + r. Hence, DA = DC. 

Thus, triangle DAC has DA = DC, making it isoceles with DA = DC. Hence, angle at D is 65°, which is given. 

In triangle DAC, since DA = DC, the base angles at A and C are equal. Let's call them θ. 

The sum of angles in triangle DAC is 180°, so:

65° + θ + θ = 180° → 2θ = 115° → θ = 57.5°. 

So angle at A (DAC) is 57.5°, and angle at C (DCA) is 57.5°. 

Now, angle DAO is part of angle DAC. Specifically, angle DAO is the angle between DA and AO. 

Similarly, angle DCO is part of angle DCA, the angle between DC and CO. 

Let me analyze angle DAO. 

In triangle DAO, we have DA, AO, and DO. We know OA = r, and DA = DO + r. 

Let me denote DO = x. Then DA = x + r. 

Using the Law of Sines in triangle DAO: 

sin(angle DAO)/DO = sin(angle DOA)/DA 

But I need to relate the angles. Alternatively, since DA = x + r and AO = r, and angle at D is part of the larger angle. 

Alternatively, since angle DAC is 57.5°, and angle DAO is part of it. Let me see: 

Angle DAC is the angle at A between DA and CA. But angle DAO is the angle at A between DA and AO. So if I can find the relationship between CA and AO, I can find angle DAO. 

But I don't have information about CA. 

Alternatively, consider triangle AOC. 

Points A, O, C. OA = OC = r. So triangle AOC is isoceles with OA = OC. Hence, angles at A and C are equal. Let's call them φ. 

The angle at O in triangle AOC is 180 - 2φ. 

But what is this angle? It is the angle between OA and OC. 

But how does this relate to other parts? 

Let me try to find φ. 

The angle at O between OA and OC is part of the angles around point O. 

Previously, we had angle at O from triangle AOB as 50°, and from triangle BOC as 180 - 2β. 

But without knowing β, it's hard to proceed. 

However, we know that the sum of all angles around O is 360°. 

Let me list all angles around O: 

1. Angle between AB and BC: this is the angle from AB to BC, which includes the angle from AB to BO (which is 50° from triangle AOB) and from BO to BC (which is 0° since O is on BC). So total is 50°. 

Wait, this is getting too abstract. Perhaps it's time to switch to a different strategy, using the earlier result that in triangle DAC, angles at A and C are 57.5°, and relating this to the desired angles. 

Angle DAO is part of angle DAC (57.5°). If I can find how much of this angle is taken by angle DAO, then I can find it. 

But how? Let me consider triangle DAO. 

In triangle DAO, we have DA = x + r, AO = r, and DO = x. 

Using the Law of Cosines in triangle DAO: 

DA² = AO² + DO² - 2 * AO * DO * cos(angle AOD) 

Wait, angle AOD is the angle at O between AO and DO. 

But I don't know angle AOD. 

Alternatively, using Law of Sines: 

sin(angle DAO)/DO = sin(angle AOD)/DA 

But without knowing angle AOD, this is not helpful. 

This seems too complex. Let me return to the earlier idea that angle DAC is 57.5°, and angle DAO is part of it. If I can find the relation between angle DAO and other known angles. 

Consider that angle DAO is the angle between DA and AO. Since DA is part of the line DA passing through O, and AO is from A to O. 

Let me consider the line DA passing through O, with D, O, A colinear. Hence, angle DAO is the angle between DA and AO, which is 180° minus the angle between DA and AO. Wait, no. At point A, the line DA extends from A through O to D. So angle DAO is the angle between DA (from A to D) and AO (from A to O). Since O is between D and A, the angle DAO is the angle between DA (towards D) and AO (towards O). This is a straight line, so the angle is 180°, but that can't be. 

Wait, no. At point A, DA is a line from A to D, and AO is a line from A to O. Since O is on DA, the angle between DA and AO is 0°, because they are the same line. This suggests another contradiction. 

This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding of the configuration. 

Given the time I've spent and the recurring contradictions, I'll try to recall that in such problems, often the sum of the requested angles is 180° minus the given angles, or some combination. Given the options, and the angles at B and D being 65°, and the need to find the sum, it's likely that the answer is 180 - 2*65 = 50°, but this isn't among the options. Alternatively, 180 - 65 = 115, but that's not an option either. 

Wait, the options are A:90°, B:110°, C:120°, D:165°. 

Given the earlier calculation where angle DAO was 25° and angle DCO was 0°, which didn't make sense, but if I assume that angle DAO is 25° and angle DCO is 25°, their sum would be 50°, not in options. 

Alternatively, if there's symmetry, and the sum is 180 - 65 - 65 = 50°, still not matching. 

Wait, let me think of the total sum of angles around O. Earlier, we had alpha + beta +
