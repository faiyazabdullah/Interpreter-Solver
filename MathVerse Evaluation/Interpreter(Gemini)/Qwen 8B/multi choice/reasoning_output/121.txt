<think>
Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F, P. Lines connecting them: Line(A,B), Line(A,C), Line(A,D), Line(A,P). Then there are other lines like Line(B,E), Line(C,F), Line(D,E), Line(D,F). Also, triangles mentioned: Triangle(A,D,E) and Triangle(A,D,F). Lengths given: AB is 50.0 units, AD is 14.0 units. There are equalities about lengths AE=AF and DE=DF. Also, some angle bisector conditions: Line(AP) bisects angle BAC, and angles at A (BAE and CAF?) are equal. Plus, points B, D, C lie on the same line, since BDC is colinear when the umbrella is open. 

The question asks for the area of oil paper needed, which probably refers to the total area covered by the umbrella's structure. Since it mentions that when opened, BDC is a straight line, maybe the shape involves some triangles or sectors whose areas we need to compute.

Let me start by visualizing the diagram. Point A is connected to B, C, D, P. From the lines, B is connected to E, C to F, D to E and F. Triangles ADE and ADF are present. Given that AE=AF and DE=DF, so triangles ADE and ADF are congruent? Wait, but they share AD, and AE=AF, DE=DF. So if AD is common, then triangles ADE and ADF would be congruent by SSS? Because sides AD, AE, DE vs AD, AF, DF. But since AE=AF and DE=DF, yes. Therefore, those triangles are congruent. Hence, angles at A would be equal? Or maybe not directly, but the congruence implies some symmetry.

Also, AP bisects angle BAC. So point P lies somewhere such that line AP splits angle BAC into two equal parts. Additionally, point D lies on line AP, according to the predicate: PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(A,P)). So D is on AP. Also, since BDC is collinear when opened, meaning points B, D, C are on the same line. Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(B,D,C)) and similarly for D and C. So Line(B,D,C) is a straight line containing B, D, C. Therefore, BD and DC are parts of this line. So D is between B and C? Or could be extended?

But also, from the lines: Line(B,E) and Line(C,F). Points E and F are connected to D via lines DE and DF. And since DE=DF, triangle DEF is isoceles with DE=DF. Also, AE=AF, so triangle AEF is isoceles with AE=AF. 

Now, the main goal is to find the area of the oil paper, which likely refers to the area of certain regions. Since it's a paper umbrella, perhaps the area consists of several triangular sections. Let me think.

Given that when the umbrella is opened, BDC is a straight line. So in the open position, points B, D, C are colinear. Also, since D lies on AP, which is the angle bisector of angle BAC. So AP is the angle bisector, and D is a point on AP. Also, AD is given as 14.0 units, and AB is 50.0 units. Maybe we need to find the length of AP, or use coordinates to calculate areas.

Another thought: since AE=AF and DE=DF, perhaps points E and F are symmetric with respect to AP. Since AP is the angle bisector. Also, since D is on AP, maybe ED and FD are symmetrical around AP. So maybe triangles ADE and ADF are congruent, leading to some symmetry.

Alternatively, considering coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Let me assume that AP is along the x-axis, since it's the angle bisector. Let me define coordinates accordingly.

Since AP is the angle bisector of angle BAC. Let me suppose that angle BAC is split into two equal angles by AP. Let me assign coordinates such that AP is the x-axis. Let me set point A at (0,0). Let me take point D lying on AP, so its coordinates are (d, 0), where d is the distance from A to D, which is given as 14.0. So D is at (14, 0).

Now, since AP is the angle bisector, points B and C are located such that line AB and AC form the angle being bisected by AP. Let me consider AB and AC making angles θ and θ with AP (since AP is the bisector). However, without loss of generality, maybe I can choose coordinates for B and C such that they are symmetric with respect to AP.

Wait, but AB has length 50.0. Let me think. Suppose AP is the x-axis. Let me denote the direction of AP as positive x-axis. Let me assume that angle BAC is split into two equal angles by AP. So, if I take AB and AC such that they are symmetric with respect to AP. For example, if AP is the x-axis, then AB could be in one half-plane and AC in the other, forming equal angles with AP.

But how to model this? Let me try. Let me suppose that angle between AB and AP is α, and angle between AC and AP is also α, so that AP bisects angle BAC. Then, coordinates of B and C can be determined based on these angles.

However, since we know AB = 50.0 and AD = 14.0, and D lies on AP. Also, points E and F are such that AE=AF and DE=DF. Also, lines BE and CF connect to E and F respectively, and D connects to E and F.

Alternatively, since DE = DF, and D is on AP, points E and F are equidistant from D. Also, AE = AF, implying that E and F are equidistant from A. So, points E and F lie on a circle centered at A with radius AE = AF. Also, since DE = DF, they lie on a circle centered at D with radius DE = DF. So the intersection points of these two circles would give E and F.

Moreover, since lines BE and CF are drawn. Given that B, D, C are colinear. So, line BDC passes through D, which is on AP.

This seems complicated, but maybe we can find coordinates for all points.

Let me proceed step by step.

Set up coordinate system:

Let’s place point A at (0, 0).

Let’s take AP as the x-axis. Let’s let D be at (14, 0) because AD = 14.0.

Since AP is the angle bisector of angle BAC, and D lies on AP, so AP is the bisector. Let’s assume that AB and AC are symmetric with respect to the x-axis (AP). So, if AP is the x-axis, then AB and AC make equal angles above and below the x-axis. However, since the umbrella is a flat object, maybe both B and C are on the same side? Wait, but the problem states that when opened, BDC is a straight line. So points B, D, C are colinear. If D is on AP, then AP is part of the line BDC. So, line BDC contains points B, D, C, with D between B and C? Or maybe D is extending beyond B or C?

Assuming that when the umbrella is opened, BDC is a straight line, so line BDC includes points B, D, C. Since D is on AP, which is the angle bisector. Let me imagine that line BDC extends through D, passing through B and C. So, if I have point D at (14, 0), then points B and C are on opposite sides of D along the line BDC. Wait, but since AP is the angle bisector, and B and C are connected to A. So AB and AC are two ribs of the umbrella. So, when the umbrella is open, B and C are separated by the angle bisector AP.

But how do points B and C relate to line BDC? Since B, D, C are colinear, then line BDC is the line that connects B and C through D. So, D is between B and C. So, if I consider line BDC, which passes through D. Let me assume coordinates for B and C such that line BDC passes through D(14, 0). Let me parameterize this line.

Let me suppose that line BDC has some slope m. Let me assign coordinates to B and C such that they lie on this line. Let me denote the coordinates of B as (x1, y1) and C as (x2, y2), lying on the line passing through D(14, 0). Also, since AP is the angle bisector, and points B and C are connected to A(0,0). 

But perhaps there's another way. Since AP is the angle bisector of angle BAC, and D lies on AP. Also, given that AE = AF and DE = DF, which suggests that E and F are reflections over AP? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, since DE = DF and AE = AF, maybe E and F are located such that they are images under reflection across AP? Or some other symmetry.

Alternatively, since AE = AF and DE = DF, triangles AED and AFD are congruent? Wait, earlier thought was that triangles ADE and ADF are congruent by SSS. Because AD is common, AE = AF, DE = DF. So triangles ADE ≅ ADF by SSS. Therefore, corresponding angles would be equal. Thus, ∠DAE = ∠DAF, which implies that AP is the angle bisector, which aligns with the given condition that AP bisects angle BAC. So this seems consistent.

Therefore, points E and F are such that they are located symmetrically with respect to AP. Since AP is the angle bisector, and AE = AF, DE = DF. So, E and F are mirror images over AP.

Now, given that, perhaps E and F are located such that lines BE and CF intersect at some points, but I'm not sure yet.

But the question is about the area of the oil paper required. The oil paper would cover the surfaces of the umbrella. In a typical paper umbrella, there are multiple triangular panels. Since the problem mentions that when opened, BDC is a straight line, and the umbrella is made of paper, so maybe the area is the sum of the areas of certain triangles.

Looking back at the given triangles: Triangle ADE and ADF are mentioned. Also, the lines BE, CF, DE, DF are present. Perhaps the oil paper covers the regions bounded by these lines.

Alternatively, since the umbrella is circular? Wait, the answer options include π terms, so maybe it's involving sectors or circles. But the problem mentions "the area of oil paper", and the options include answers like 70π cm², 2500π cm², etc. So maybe the area is a sector or something related.

Wait, but the given data includes AB = 50, AD = 14, and various equalities. Let me see if I can find the area of a sector or triangle.

Alternatively, since AP is the angle bisector, and D is on AP, maybe we can find the length of AP, and then use that to find some areas.

But first, let's think about triangle ABD and ACD? Wait, but AB is given as 50, AD is 14. If we can find BD and CD, maybe we can find more info.

But since points B, D, C are colinear, and D is between B and C. Let me denote BD as x and DC as y. So BC = x + y. But I don't know x or y yet.

But maybe using the fact that AP is the angle bisector of angle BAC. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of AB to AC equals the ratio of BD to DC. Wait, the Angle Bisector Theorem states that if a bisector of an angle of a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. However, here, AP is the angle bisector of angle BAC, and it intersects BC at D. Wait, but in our case, D is on AP, but does AP intersect BC at D? Wait, the line AP is the angle bisector, and D is a point on AP. However, the line BDC is the line containing B, D, C. So, D is the intersection point of AP and BC. Therefore, applying the Angle Bisector Theorem here: AB / AC = BD / DC.

But wait, in standard Angle Bisector Theorem, if AP is the bisector of angle BAC and meets BC at D, then AB/AC = BD/DC. But in our case, AP is the bisector, and D lies on AP. But does AP meet BC at D? Yes, because line BDC is the line containing B, D, C, so D is the intersection of AP and BC. Therefore, the Angle Bisector Theorem applies here.

Thus, AB / AC = BD / DC. But we don't know AC. However, we might be able to find AC using other information.

But we also have that AE = AF and DE = DF. Let me think about triangles ADE and ADF. Earlier, we said they are congruent. Therefore, angles at D are equal. Also, since DE = DF, triangle DEF is isoceles with base EF and apex at D. 

Additionally, since AE = AF, points E and F lie on a circle centered at A with radius AE = AF. Also, since DE = DF, they lie on a circle centered at D with radius DE. Therefore, points E and F are the intersections of these two circles. So, the location of E and F depends on the positions of A and D.

But how does this help us? Maybe we need to find coordinates of E and F to compute areas.

Alternatively, since AP is the angle bisector, and D is on AP. Let me consider coordinates again.

Earlier, I placed A at (0, 0), D at (14, 0). Let me assume that AP is the x-axis. Now, since AP is the angle bisector of angle BAC, and points B and C are located such that AB = 50.0, AC is unknown. But since D is on AP, which is the angle bisector, and BD/DC = AB/AC.

But we need more relations. Also, given that AE = AF and DE = DF. Let me think about triangles ADE and ADF. They are congruent, so AE = AF, DE = DF, AD is common. So, angle at A is shared? No, because the triangles are ADE and ADF. So angle at A for each triangle is angle DAE and DAF. Since AE = AF and AD is common, and DE = DF, then angles at D are equal. So, angle ADE = angle ADF. Which makes sense due to congruency.

But how to find AE or AF? Maybe using coordinates.

Let me try to parametrize points B and C. Since AP is the angle bisector, and D lies on AP. Let me consider that line BC passes through D(14, 0). Let me denote coordinates for B and C as follows: since line BC passes through D(14, 0), and D divides BC in the ratio AB/AC. 

From the Angle Bisector Theorem: AB / AC = BD / DC. Let me denote AB = 50, AC = c (unknown). Let BD = x, DC = y. Then 50 / c = x / y. Also, BC = x + y. But without knowing x or y, this may not help directly.

But we also have information about points E and F. Since AE = AF and DE = DF. Let me think about coordinates of E and F.

Suppose that point E is located such that AE = AF and DE = DF. So, if I can express coordinates of E and F in terms of variables, maybe I can find equations.

Alternatively, since E and F are points such that AE = AF and DE = DF, and given that lines BE and CF are drawn. 

Alternatively, since DE = DF, triangle DEF is isoceles with DE = DF. So, point D is the apex of this isoceles triangle, and E and F are the base vertices. Also, AE = AF, so points E and F are equidistant from A. 

Maybe we can find coordinates of E and F by solving equations. Let me attempt that.

Let me assume that E has coordinates (e_x, e_y), and F has coordinates (f_x, f_y). Since AE = AF, then sqrt(e_x^2 + e_y^2) = sqrt(f_x^2 + f_y^2). Also, DE = DF: distance from D(14, 0) to E equals distance from D(14, 0) to F. So sqrt((e_x - 14)^2 + (e_y - 0)^2) = sqrt((f_x - 14)^2 + (f_y - 0)^2). Also, lines BE and CF connect B to E and C to F. But without knowing coordinates of B and C, this might be difficult.

Alternatively, since B, D, C are colinear, and D is at (14, 0), let me parametrize line BDC. Let me assume that line BDC has some slope m, and points B and C are located on this line. Let me parametrize B as (14 - t, k*t) and C as (14 + s, k*s), where t and s are parameters. Wait, but this might get too abstract. Alternatively, since D is between B and C, I can write coordinates for B as (14 - p, q) and C as (14 + r, -q), assuming that the line BDC is symmetric with respect to D. Wait, but why would that be the case? Unless there's some symmetry. 

Alternatively, since AP is the angle bisector, and points B and C are such that AB = 50, AC is unknown. But maybe we can find AC using the given information.

Wait, perhaps using Stewart's Theorem on triangle ABC with cevian AD. Stewart's Theorem relates the lengths of the sides of the triangle to the length of a cevian. The formula is AB² * DC + AC² * BD = AD² * BC + BD * DC * BC. 

But since we don't know AC or BD, DC, this might not be helpful directly. However, we might combine this with the Angle Bisector Theorem.

From the Angle Bisector Theorem: AB / AC = BD / DC. Let me denote BD = x, DC = y. So AB / AC = x/y → 50 / AC = x/y → AC = (50y)/x. 

Also, BC = x + y.

Stewart's Theorem gives: AB² * y + AC² * x = AD² * (x + y) + x*y*(x + y)

Plugging in AB = 50, AD = 14, AC = 50y/x:

Left side: 50² * y + ( (50y/x)^2 ) * x = 2500y + (2500y² / x )

Right side: 14² * (x + y) + x*y*(x + y) = 196(x + y) + xy(x + y)

So equation becomes:

2500y + 2500y² / x = 196(x + y) + xy(x + y)

Hmm, this looks complicated. We have two variables x and y, but we need another relation. 

Is there another relation we can derive from the given conditions? 

We also have the information about points E and F. Let me think about triangles ADE and ADF. Since they are congruent, maybe we can find some relations. 

Alternatively, since AE = AF and DE = DF, and D lies on AP. Let me consider coordinates again.

Let me go back to coordinate system with A at (0, 0), D at (14, 0), AP as x-axis. Let me assume that line AP is the x-axis, so P is somewhere along it. Now, points B and C are such that line BDC passes through D(14, 0). Let me assume that line BDC has some slope m. Let me parametrize points B and C as follows: since D is between B and C, I can write B as (14 - t, mt) and C as (14 + t, -mt), making the line BDC pass through D(14,0) with slope m. This assumes that BD = DC, but we don't know if that's true. However, from the Angle Bisector Theorem, AB / AC = BD / DC. If I assume BD = DC, then AB = AC, but that might not hold. So this assumption might not be valid.

Alternatively, since we don't know the slope m or the value of t, this might not help. 

Perhaps another approach: since AE = AF and DE = DF, and D lies on AP, which is the angle bisector. Let me consider triangle ADE and ADF. Since they are congruent, the heights from E and F to AP would be equal. Also, since AE = AF, the distances from E and F to A are equal. 

But how does this help us? Maybe if I can find the coordinates of E and F, then I can find the area of some region.

Alternatively, since AE = AF and DE = DF, points E and F lie on the perpendicular bisector of AD? No, because AE = AF means they're on a circle centered at A, and DE = DF means they're on a circle centered at D. So their intersection points would be E and F.

Let me find the intersection of two circles: one centered at A(0,0) with radius r (which is AE = AF), and another centered at D(14,0) with radius s (DE = DF). The intersection points E and F satisfy:

For circle A: x² + y² = r²

For circle D: (x - 14)² + y² = s²

Subtracting the two equations:

(x - 14)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = s² - r² → x² - 28x + 196 + y² - x² - y² = s² - r² → -28x + 196 = s² - r² → x = (196 - (s² - r²)) / 28

This gives the x-coordinate of E and F. Since AE = AF and DE = DF, r = AE = AF and s = DE = DF. But unless we know r or s, this might not help.

But perhaps there is a relationship between r and s. Let me think about lines BE and CF. For instance, line BE connects B to E, and line CF connects C to F. But without knowing coordinates of B and C, it's hard to proceed.

Wait, but the problem mentions that when the umbrella is opened, BDC is a straight line. So, in the open state, points B, D, C are colinear. Also, the oil paper is required to make the umbrella, which likely refers to the surface area of the umbrella's structure. Since it's a paper umbrella, it might consist of several triangular faces. For example, the main ribs AB, AC, AD, and others, forming various triangles.

Alternatively, since there are triangles ADE and ADF, and possibly others. The area might involve combining these triangles.

Wait, looking back at the given triangles: Triangle(A,D,E) and Triangle(A,D,F). These are two triangles sharing the side AD. If we can find the area of these triangles, and add them together, maybe that contributes to the total area.

But to find the area of these triangles, we need the height or other dimensions. For example, the area of triangle ADE is (AD * h)/2, where h is the height from E to AD. Similarly for ADF. But since AE = AF and DE = DF, maybe these heights are related.

Alternatively, using coordinates, if we can find the coordinates of E and F, we can calculate the area of triangles ADE and ADF.

But to do that, we need more information. Let me think about the given data again.

We know AB = 50, AD = 10.0? Wait, AD is given as 14.0. So AD = 14.0. Also, AP is the angle bisector. Let me recall that in triangle ABC, with angle bisector AD, and AB = 50, AD = 14. 

Wait, but earlier, I considered applying the Angle Bisector Theorem and Stewart's Theorem, but couldn't resolve the variables. Let me revisit that with the current information.

From the Angle Bisector Theorem: AB / AC = BD / DC. Let me call AB = 50, AC = c, BD = x, DC = y. So 50/c = x/y → c = 50y/x.

From Stewart's Theorem on triangle ABC with cevian AD:

AB² * y + AC² * x = AD² * (x + y) + x*y*(x + y)

Substituting AB = 50, AD = 14, AC = 50y/x:

Left side: 50² * y + (50y/x)^2 * x = 2500y + 2500y²/x

Right side: 14² * (x + y) + xy(x + y) = 196(x + y) + xy(x + y)

So:

2500y + (2500y²)/x = 196(x + y) + xy(x + y)

This equation has two variables x and y. To solve, we need another equation. Where can we get another equation?

Recall that DE = DF. Let me think about this. Points E and F are such that DE = DF. Also, since AE = AF, and E and F are points on the circles as discussed earlier. 

Alternatively, since AE = AF and DE = DF, and D lies on AP, which is the angle bisector. Let me think about triangle ADE and ADF. Since they are congruent, then the length AE = AF, and DE = DF, and AD is common. So, the triangles are congruent, hence angles at A are equal, which confirms that AP is the angle bisector.

But how to relate this to the previous equation?

Maybe we can find the coordinates of E and F in terms of x and y?

Alternatively, let's think about the coordinates of E and F. Let me assume that E is on BE and F is on CF. But without knowing coordinates of B and C, it's challenging.

Wait, but since B, D, C are colinear and D is at (14, 0), and line BDC is the line passing through D. Let me assume that line BDC is horizontal for simplicity? No, unless specified. Alternatively, let me consider that since AP is the angle bisector, and points B and C are on either side of AP. Wait, but earlier, I assumed AP is the x-axis, so if AP is the angle bisector, then AB and AC are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Let me try that.

Let me assume that AB makes an angle θ with AP (x-axis), and AC makes the same angle θ on the other side. So, coordinates of B and C would be symmetric with respect to the x-axis.

Let me define coordinates for B and C. Let me say that AB has length 50, so if the angle between AB and AP (x-axis) is θ, then coordinates of B would be (50 cosθ, 50 sinθ). Similarly, coordinates of C would be (50 cos(-θ), 50 sin(-θ)) = (50 cosθ, -50 sinθ). 

Now, line BDC passes through D(14, 0). So, points B, D, C are colinear. Let me check if this holds.

Points B(50 cosθ, 50 sinθ), D(14, 0), and C(50 cosθ, -50 sinθ). Are these three points colinear?

To check if they are colinear, the slope from B to D should be equal to the slope from D to C.

Slope from B to D: (0 - 50 sinθ)/(14 - 50 cosθ)

Slope from D to C: (-50 sinθ - 0)/(50 cosθ - 14) = (-50 sinθ)/(50 cosθ - 14)

For these slopes to be equal:

[ -50 sinθ ] / (14 - 50 cosθ) = [ -50 sinθ ] / (50 cosθ - 14 )

Notice that denominator on left is -(50 cosθ - 14), so the left slope is [ -50 sinθ ] / [ -(50 cosθ - 14) ] = [50 sinθ] / (50 cosθ - 14), which equals the right slope. So yes, the slopes are equal. Therefore, points B, D, C are colinear! Perfect, this satisfies the condition that when the umbrella is opened, BDC is a straight line. Great!

So, this coordinate setup works. Now, with this, we can find θ using the fact that D lies on line BC. Wait, but D is already defined as (14, 0), which is on line BC. So, with this setup, we can find the value of θ.

But how? Let me find the equation of line BC and substitute D(14, 0) into it.

Points B(50 cosθ, 50 sinθ) and C(50 cosθ, -50 sinθ). Wait, but wait, if both B and C have the same x-coordinate, 50 cosθ, then line BC is vertical, x = 50 cosθ. But point D is at (14, 0), so for D to lie on BC, x-coordinate of BC must be 14. Therefore, 50 cosθ = 14 → cosθ = 14/50 = 7/25. 

Ah! So cosθ = 7/25. Therefore, we can find sinθ from this. Since sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, sinθ = sqrt(1 - (7/25)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/625) = sqrt(576/625) = 24/25. So sinθ is ±24/25. Since θ is the angle between AB and AP (x-axis), it can be positive or negative depending on direction, but since we took C as mirrored, it's okay.

So, now we have cosθ = 7/25, sinθ = 24/25.

Now, with this, we can find coordinates of B and C:

B is (50 * 7/25, 50 * 24/25) = (14, 24*2) = (14, 48)? Wait, 50 * 7/25 = (50/25)*7 = 2*7 = 14. Yes. And 50 * 24/25 = 2*24 = 48. So B is (14, 48). Similarly, C is (14, -48). 

Wait, but point D is at (14, 0). So line BC is the vertical line x=14, passing through B(14,48), D(14,0), and C(14,-48). That makes perfect sense! So this setup fits all the conditions.

Great! Now, we have coordinates for points A(0,0), B(14,48), C(14,-48), D(14,0), and AP is the x-axis. Now, we need to find points E and F such that AE = AF and DE = DF. 

Let me recall that AE = AF and DE = DF. Also, lines BE and CF are drawn. Let me find coordinates for E and F.

First, let's find point E. It's on line BE. Line BE connects B(14,48) to E. Similarly, point F is on line CF connecting C(14,-48) to F. Also, AE = AF and DE = DF.

But how to find E and F?

Since AE = AF, points E and F are equidistant from A(0,0). Let me denote E as (x1, y1), F as (x2, y2). Then:

AE = AF → x1² + y1² = x2² + y2².

DE = DF → distance from D(14,0) to E equals distance from D(14,0) to F:

(x1 - 14)^2 + y1^2 = (x2 - 14)^2 + y2^2.

Also, E lies on line BE, and F lies on line CF.

Let me find equations for lines BE and CF.

Line BE goes from B(14,48) to E. But we don't know E yet. Similarly for line CF.

But since E is on BE, let me parametrize line BE. Let me write the parametric equations.

Parametrize line BE: starting at B(14,48), going towards some point E. Let me use a parameter t.

But without knowing where E is, this is tricky. Alternatively, since we know DE = DF and AE = AF, maybe there's a way to find E and F.

Alternatively, since E and F are points such that DE = DF and AE = AF, they are symmetric with respect to AP (the x-axis). Let me check.

Because if we reflect E across the x-axis, we get F, since DE = DF and AE = AF. Let me assume that E is (x, y), then F would be (x, -y). Let me verify this.

If E is (x,y), then F is (x,-y). Then AE = AF since both are sqrt(x² + y²). DE = sqrt((x-14)^2 + y²), and DF = sqrt((x-14)^2 + (-y)^2) = same as DE. So yes, this satisfies DE = DF. 

Thus, E and F are symmetric across the x-axis. So, their coordinates are (x, y) and (x, -y). Now, since E lies on line BE, which connects B(14,48) to E(x,y), and F lies on line CF, which connects C(14,-48) to F(x,-y).

So, let's focus on finding point E(x, y) on line BE.

Equation of line BE: passes through B(14,48) and E(x,y). Let me find parametric equations for this line.

Parametric equations: Starting at B(14,48), moving towards E(x,y). Let me parameterize this line with parameter t:

x(t) = 14 + t(x - 14)

y(t) = 48 + t(y - 48)

When t=0, we are at B; when t=1, we are at E.

But we need to find E such that DE = DF and AE = AF. But since E is (x,y), and F is (x,-y), we need to find x and y such that E lies on line BE and F lies on line CF.

Alternatively, since E lies on line BE, which goes from B(14,48) to E(x,y). So, the line BE can be expressed as passing through B and E. Let me find the equation of line BE.

The slope of BE is (y - 48)/(x - 14). But since E is (x,y), and this line passes through B(14,48), the equation is:

(y - 48) = [(y - 48)/(x - 14)](x - 14), which is trivially true. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, since E lies on line BE, which is the same line as BE. So, we can express E as a point on BE. Let me find the coordinates of E in terms of t.

Let me parametrize line BE with parameter t such that when t=0, it's at B, and when t=1, it's at E. Wait, but I don't know where E is. Alternatively, let me express E as a general point on line BE.

Let me find the equation of line BE. Let me use the two-point form.

The line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(x,y). But since E is unknown, this isn't helpful. Instead, since we know that E is on line BE, which is infinite, but we need to find E such that DE = DF and AE = AF.

Alternatively, since E lies on line BE, and F lies on line CF, which is symmetric. Let me consider that line BE has some relation to the rest of the diagram.

Alternatively, since DE = DF, and D is (14,0), and E is (x,y), F is (x,-y). So, DE = sqrt[(x-14)^2 + y^2]. Also, since E is on line BE, which goes from B(14,48) to E(x,y). Let me find the equation of line BE.

The line BE goes through B(14,48) and E(x,y). So, the vector from B to E is (x-14, y-48). Parametric equations for BE: any point on BE can be written as (14 + k(x-14), 48 + k(y-48)) for k ∈ ℝ.

But E is one of these points, so when k=1, we are at E: (14 + (x-14), 48 + (y-48)) = (x, y). So, this doesn't help directly.

But since E lies on line BE, and we want to find E such that DE = sqrt((x-14)^2 + y^2). Also, AE = sqrt(x² + y²). 

But how to relate this? Maybe using the fact that E lies on BE, so we can write the parametric equation of BE and impose the condition DE = DF, but since F is (x,-y), and DE = DF, which is already satisfied.

Wait, but we need to ensure that E is on BE and F is on CF. Let me try to find E such that it lies on BE and satisfies AE = AF and DE = DF. 

But since F is the reflection of E over x-axis, and F lies on CF. Let me consider line CF. Line CF goes from C(14,-48) to F(x,-y). Since F is (x,-y), this line passes through C(14,-48) and F(x,-y). 

So, for F to be on line CF, which is the same line as CF. But since F is (x,-y), this is automatically true. So, we just need to find E(x,y) such that:

1. E lies on line BE.
2. F(x,-y) lies on line CF.
3. AE = AF (already ensured by symmetry).
4. DE = DF (also ensured by symmetry).

So, the main constraint is that E lies on line BE, and F lies on line CF. But since F is the reflection of E, and line CF is the reflection of line BE over x-axis, this is automatically satisfied. Therefore, we just need to ensure that E lies on line BE, which is already true by definition.

Wait, this seems too vague. How to find E?

Alternatively, since E lies on line BE, and we have coordinates for B and E, maybe we can express the line BE in terms of E's coordinates and use the condition that DE = ... ?

Wait, but DE is fixed once E is chosen. Let me think differently. Since we have coordinates for B and C, and D is at (14,0), maybe we can find the locus of points E such that DE = DF and AE = AF. 

But since AE = AF and DE = DF, and F is the reflection of E, we can focus on finding E such that it lies on line BE, and satisfies DE = something. 

Alternatively, since DE = DF and AE = AF, and D is at (14,0), let me use the distance formula.

For point E(x,y):

Distance from E to D: sqrt[(x-14)^2 + (y)^2]

Distance from A to E: sqrt[x² + y²]

But we don't have a direct relation between these unless we have more constraints. 

Wait, but since E lies on line BE, which goes from B(14,48) to E(x,y). So, E is a point on line BE. Let me find the equation of line BE. 

Line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(x,y). But since we don't know E, let me instead consider that E is a variable point on line BE, and find the condition for DE = DF and AE = AF. 

Wait, but since F is (x,-y), and line CF goes through C(14,-48) and F(x,-y), which is the reflection of line BE over x-axis. So, this suggests that E and F are symmetric, and their positions are determined by the intersection of certain conditions.

Alternatively, since AE = AF and DE = DF, and D is at (14,0), let me consider that E and F are the intersections of two circles: one centered at A with radius r and one centered at D with radius s. But since AE = AF and DE = DF, these radii are r and s. 

But how to find r and s? Maybe using the fact that E lies on line BE and F lies on line CF. 

Let me consider that E lies on line BE. Let me parametrize line BE. Let me write the parametric equations for line BE. 

Parametric equations for BE: starting at B(14,48), and going in some direction. Let me parameterize it with a parameter k. Let me say that E is at a parameter k from B, so that E = B + k*(direction vector of BE). But since we don't know the direction, this is still unclear.

Alternatively, since we know coordinates of B and D, and E is on BE, maybe we can find the coordinates of E in terms of some variable.

Let me find the equation of line BE. Since E is a point on line BE, which goes from B(14,48) to E(x,y). Wait, this is circular. 

Wait, perhaps I can express the line BE in terms of its slope. Let me assume that line BE has slope m. Then, the equation is y - 48 = m(x - 14). Point E(x,y) lies on this line. Also, since E is such that DE = DF and AE = AF, but I still don't see how to proceed.

Let me think about the condition DE = DF. Since DE = DF and F is the reflection of E, this condition is automatically satisfied. So, the main condition is that E lies on line BE. But how to find E?

Wait, but maybe there is a unique point E that satisfies AE = AF and DE = DF. Let me think about this. Since AE = AF and DE = DF, and F is the reflection of E, then the set of points E such that AE = AF is the circle centered at A with radius AE, and the set of points E such that DE = DF is the circle centered at D with radius DE. Their intersection points are E and F. But since F is the reflection of E, this suggests that E is located at the intersection of these circles. 

But to find the exact coordinates, we need to find the intersection of these circles. Let me write the equations:

Circle centered at A(0,0): x² + y² = r².

Circle centered at D(14,0): (x-14)^2 + y² = s².

Their intersection points satisfy:

From the first equation: x² + y² = r².

From the second equation: (x-14)^2 + y² = s².

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

(x-14)^2 + y² - x² - y² = s² - r² → x² - 28x + 196 - x² = s² - r² → -28x + 196 = s² - r² → x = (196 - (s² - r²))/28.

This gives the x-coordinate of E and F. But since E lies on line BE, we can substitute this x into the equation of line BE to find y.

But we need to relate r and s. However, since E lies on line BE, and F lies on line CF, which is the reflection of BE, this might provide a relation.

Alternatively, let me note that since E lies on line BE, which goes from B(14,48) to E(x,y), and we have the x-coordinate of E as x = (196 - (s² - r²))/28. But without knowing r and s, this is still stuck.

Wait, but since E lies on line BE, which passes through B(14,48) and E(x,y), the slope of BE is (y - 48)/(x - 14). Let me denote this slope as m. So, m = (y - 48)/(x - 14).

But also, from the circle equations, x = (196 - (s² - r²))/28. But s = DE = sqrt((x-14)^2 + y²), and r = AE = sqrt(x² + y²). So, s² - r² = [(x-14)^2 + y²] - [x² + y²] = x² - 28x + 196 + y² - x² - y² = -28x + 196. 

So, from earlier, x = (196 - (s² - r²))/28 = (196 - (-28x + 196))/28 = (196 + 28x - 196)/28 = 28x/28 = x. This is a tautology, giving no new information. So this approach isn't helping.

Alternative idea: Since AE = AF and DE = DF, and D is at (14,0), let me consider that E and F are points such that they are located at the intersection of circles centered at A and D. Let me assume that the circles intersect at E and F. Let me find the radical axis of these circles, which is the line containing E and F. The radical axis is given by x² + y² - ((x-14)^2 + y²) = 0 → x² + y² - x² + 28x - 196 - y² = 0 → 28x - 196 = 0 → x = 7. 

So, the radical axis is x = 7. Therefore, points E and F lie on the line x = 7. This is crucial!

So, points E and F are on the vertical line x = 7. So their x-coordinate is 7. Therefore, E is (7, y) and F is (7, -y). 

Now, since E lies on line BE, which goes from B(14,48) to E(7, y). Let me find the equation of line BE.

The line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y). Let me find the equation of this line.

The slope m of BE is (y - 48)/(7 - 14) = (y - 48)/(-7) = (48 - y)/7.

The equation of line BE can be written as:

y - 48 = [(48 - y)/7](x - 14)

But since E(7, y) lies on this line, substituting x = 7, y = y:

y - 48 = [(48 - y)/7](7 - 14) → y - 48 = [(48 - y)/7](-7) → y - 48 = -(48 - y) → y - 48 = -48 + y → 0 = 0. Again, tautology. 

But we can find y by using the fact that E(7, y) is on line BE. Let me parametrize line BE. Let me use parameter t such that when t=0, it's at B(14,48), and when t=1, it's at E(7, y). The parametric equations are:

x = 14 - 7t

y = 48 + (y - 48)t

At t=1, x = 14 - 7(1) = 7, and y = 48 + (y - 48)(1) = y. This is consistent.

But how to find y? We need another condition. Since E(7, y) is also on the circle centered at A(0,0) with radius AE = AF, and also on the circle centered at D(14,0) with radius DE = DF.

Wait, but we already used the radical axis to find x=7. Now, since E is on x=7, let me find y such that it lies on line BE and satisfies the circle conditions.

Let me use the circle centered at A(0,0): x² + y² = r². For point E(7, y), this is 7² + y² = r².

Also, since E is on line BE, and we know B(14,48) and E(7, y), we can find the equation of BE and ensure that E is on it. But since we already know E is on x=7, let me find y.

Let me find the equation of line BE. It passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y). Let me find the slope m = (y - 48)/(7 - 14) = (y - 48)/(-7).

The equation of the line is y - 48 = m(x - 14). Substituting x=7 and y=y, we get:

y - 48 = m(7 - 14) = m*(-7) → y - 48 = -7m → m = (48 - y)/7.

But m is also (y - 48)/(-7) = (48 - y)/7. So this is consistent.

Now, since E(7, y) is on line BE, and we need to find y. But how?

Wait, but we also have that DE = DF, which is already ensured by the radical axis. But we also have that AE = AF, which is already ensured by the circles. But we need to find y such that E(7, y) is on line BE. But this is always true for any y? No, because line BE is defined by B and E, so for any E on line BE, it would satisfy this. So this approach isn't giving us new info.

Wait, but we also know that E is on the circle centered at A(0,0) and the circle centered at D(14,0). Let me use the circle centered at D(14,0) for point E(7, y):

Distance from D(14,0) to E(7, y) is sqrt((7-14)^2 + (y-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + y²). This should be equal to DE, which is the radius of the circle centered at D. But we also have from the circle centered at A: AE = sqrt(7² + y²) = sqrt(49 + y²). So, DE = AE. Wait, this implies that DE = AE. But the problem states that AE = AF and DE = DF. But since DE = AE and DF = DE, this means AF = AE = DE = DF. So, AF = DE.

But how does this help? Let me see. 

Since DE = AE, and D is at (14,0), E is at (7, y). So, DE = sqrt((7-14)^2 + (y-0)^2) = sqrt(49 + y²). And AE is sqrt(7² + y²) = same value. So, this shows that DE = AE, which is consistent. So, this tells us that for any point E on x=7, DE = AE. So, this condition is automatically satisfied for all points on x=7. 

But how to find the specific y? It seems like there are infinitely many points on x=7, but the problem specifies that E is on line BE. So, we need to find the specific point E on x=7 that lies on line BE.

But line BE is defined by points B(14,48) and E(7, y). Let me find the y-coordinate of E such that it lies on this line.

Let me parametrize line BE. Let me write the parametric equations for line BE. Let me let parameter t vary from 0 to 1, where t=0 is at B(14,48) and t=1 is at E(7, y). 

The x-coordinate changes from 14 to 7, so Δx = -7. The y-coordinate changes from 48 to y, so Δy = y - 48.

So, parametric equations:

x = 14 - 7t

y = 48 + (y - 48)t

Wait, but this is recursive. Let me instead express y in terms of t. Let me assume that E is at parameter t=1, so when t=1, x = 14 - 7(1) = 7, and y = 48 + (y - 48)(1) = y. So this is consistent. But how to find y?

Actually, since E is a point on line BE, and we know that E is (7, y), let me find the equation of line BE and solve for y.

The line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y). Let me find the slope m = (y - 48)/(7 - 14) = (y - 48)/(-7). 

The equation of line BE is y - 48 = m(x - 14). Substituting x=7 and y=y, we get:

y - 48 = m(7 - 14) = m*(-7) → y - 48 = -7m → m = (48 - y)/7.

But m is also (y - 48)/(-7) = (48 - y)/7, which is the same as above. So, this doesn't give us new information. 

But since E is on line BE, and we know that E is (7, y), we can find the relation between y and the line. But without additional constraints, this seems underdetermined. 

Wait, but we also know that DE = AE. Wait, DE = AE, which we already used. But this doesn't give us new information. 

Wait, but maybe there's another condition: since E is on line BE, and F is on line CF, and the oil paper requires the area, which might involve the area of triangles ADE and ADF, or other regions. Let me think about the area of triangle ADE.

Since A is (0,0), D is (14,0), and E is (7, y). The area of triangle ADE can be computed using determinant formula:

Area = (1/2)| (Ax(By - Cy) + Dx(Cy - Ay) + Ex(Ay - Dy) ) | ? Wait, better to use coordinates.

Coordinates of A(0,0), D(14,0), E(7,y). Area is 1/2 * base * height. Base AD is 14 units, height is the y-coordinate of E, since AD is along x-axis from (0,0) to (14,0), and E is at (7,y). The height is the vertical distance from E to AD, which is y. So area of ADE is 1/2 * 14 * y = 7y.

Similarly, area of ADF is also 7y, since F is (7,-y), so the height would be |-y| = y, giving the same area. Total area for both triangles is 14y.

But what is y? To find y, we need to use the fact that E lies on line BE. Let me find y by ensuring that E lies on line BE.

Since E is on line BE, which goes from B(14,48) to E(7, y). Let me find the equation of line BE and ensure that E(7, y) lies on it.

The line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y). Let me find the equation of this line. Let me use the two-point form.

The slope m is (y - 48)/(7 - 14) = (y - 48)/(-7).

The equation is y - 48 = m(x - 14). Let me plug in x=7, y=y:

y - 48 = m(7 - 14) → y - 48 = m*(-7) → m = (48 - y)/7.

But this is the same as before. To find y, I need another condition. Wait, but since E is on line BE, and we have no other conditions, this suggests that y can be any value, but this contradicts the uniqueness of the problem. 

Wait, but there must be a specific y that satisfies the conditions of the problem. What am I missing?

Wait, the problem states that when the umbrella is opened, BDC is a straight line, which we've already incorporated. Also, the condition that AP bisects angle BAC, which we've used to set up the coordinates. But perhaps there is another condition: the fact that line AP is the angle bisector, and D is on AP. 

Wait, but AP is the x-axis, and D is at (14,0), which is on AP. So, AP is the x-axis from A(0,0) to P, which is some point. But we don't know where P is. However, since AP is the angle bisector, and we have AB = 50, AC = 50 (wait, no, earlier we found that AC is 50, since AB = 50 and from the Angle Bisector Theorem, but earlier calculations showed that AB = 50, and AC = 50y/x, but with x and y being BD and DC.

Wait, earlier, in this coordinate system, we had points B(14,48) and C(14,-48), so AB is the distance from A(0,0) to B(14,48), which is sqrt(14² + 48²) = sqrt(196 + 2304) = sqrt(2500) = 50, which matches the given AB = 50.0. So AC is the distance from A(0,0) to C(14,-48), which is also 50. So AC = 50. 

Wait, so AB = AC = 50. So triangle ABC is isoceles with AB = AC = 50, and BC is vertical line from (14,48) to (14,-48), so BC has length 96. 

Now, from the Angle Bisector Theorem: AB/AC = BD/DC. Since AB = AC = 50, this implies BD/DC = 1, so BD = DC. Therefore, D is the midpoint of BC. But in our coordinate system, B is (14,48) and C is (14,-48), so midpoint of BC is (14, (48 + (-48))/2) = (14, 0), which is point D(14,0)! So this checks out. 

So, this confirms that D is the midpoint of BC, and BD = DC = 48. Because BC is from (14,48) to (14,-48), so length is 96, so BD = 48, DC = 48. 

Now, returning to finding y. Since E is on line BE, and we know that E is (7, y), let me find y such that this point lies on line BE. 

Let me find the equation of line BE. Since it passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y), let me find the equation of this line. 

Let me use the two-point form. The slope m is (y - 48)/(7 - 14) = (y - 48)/(-7). 

The equation of the line is y - 48 = m(x - 14). 

But since E(7, y) is on this line, substituting x=7, y=y:

y - 48 = m(7 - 14) → y - 48 = m*(-7) → m = (48 - y)/7.

But this is the same as before. To find y, we need another condition. But what is it? 

Wait, since E is on line BE, and we also know that DE = AE. Wait, but DE = AE is already satisfied for any E on x=7, as we saw earlier. So this doesn't give us new information. 

But perhaps there's another condition: the fact that E is such that line BE connects to E, and F is such that line CF connects to F, and the oil paper area is the sum of certain areas. But without knowing y, we cannot compute the area.

Wait, but maybe there is a unique point E such that line BE intersects the circle centered at A and D. But since we already have x=7, and E is on x=7, and on line BE, perhaps there are two points: one is the intersection of line BE with the circle centered at A, and the other is the other intersection. But since E is on x=7, and line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y), let me find the intersection of line BE with the circle centered at A(0,0) and D(14,0). 

Wait, we already know that E is on both circles, so it's the intersection point. But since line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y), and E is on x=7, let me find the y-coordinate by solving for the intersection of line BE with the circle centered at A.

The line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y). Let me find the equation of line BE and find its intersection with the circle x² + y² = r². But since E is on both the line and the circle, this is redundant. 

Wait, but since E is on x=7, let me substitute x=7 into the line BE equation to find y.

The line BE passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y). Let me find the equation of this line. Let me use the two-point form:

(y - 48) = [(y - 48)/(7 - 14)](x - 14)

Wait, this is the same as before. Let me instead use parametric equations. Let me parameterize line BE. Let me let t be a parameter such that when t=0, we are at B(14,48), and when t=1, we are at E(7, y). 

Then, the parametric equations are:

x = 14 - 7t

y = 48 + (y - 48)t

Wait, but this is recursive. Let me instead express y in terms of t. Let me assume that at parameter t, the point is (x, y). At t=0, x=14, y=48. At t=1, x=7, y= y. The change in x is -7, and change in y is y - 48. So, for any t, x = 14 - 7t, y = 48 + (y - 48)t. 

But this is still recursive. Let me instead find the value of t where x=7. Setting x=7 = 14 - 7t → 7t = 14 - 7 → 7t = 7 → t=1. So at t=1, we are at E(7, y). 

But how to find y? We need to use the fact that E is on the circle x² + y² = r². Since E is on x=7, x=7, so 7² + y² = r². Also, since E is on line BE, and B is on the circle? No, B is not on the circle centered at A unless AB is equal to the radius. But AB is 50, so if the circle has radius 50, then B is on it. 

Wait, point B is at (14,48), and AB = 50, so it's on the circle centered at A with radius 50. So, the line BE starts at B (on the circle) and goes to E, which is also on the circle. So, E is another intersection point of line BE with the circle. 

So, line BE intersects the circle at B and E. Since B is (14,48), and E is (7, y), we can find y by solving the intersection of line BE with the circle.

Let me find the equation of line BE. Let me write it in parametric form. Let me use parameter t, with t=0 at B and t=1 at E. 

As before, x = 14 - 7t, y = 48 + (y - 48)t. Wait, this is still recursive. Let me instead use the fact that the line passes through B(14,48) and E(7, y). Let me find the equation of the line in terms of x and y.

The line BE can be expressed as:

(y - 48) = [(y - 48)/(-7)](x - 14)

But this is the same as before. Let me rearrange this equation:

Multiply both sides by -7:

-7(y - 48) = (y - 48)(x - 14)

If y ≠ 48, we can divide both sides by (y - 48):

-7 = x - 14 → x = 7.

Which is consistent with our earlier finding that x=7 for E. So, this shows that line BE is x=7, but this can't be true because it passes through B(14,48). Wait, this suggests that the line BE is x=7, but B is at x=14, which is not on x=7. Contradiction! What went wrong?

Ah! Here's the mistake: I assumed that E is on x=7, and tried to derive the equation of line BE, but this led to a contradiction. This indicates an error in my earlier assumption.

Wait, let me re-examine. Earlier, I found
