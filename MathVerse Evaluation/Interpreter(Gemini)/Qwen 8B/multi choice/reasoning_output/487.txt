MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the domain and range of a piecewise function that goes through the points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5). The answer needs to be in interval notation. 

First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. The function is piecewise, so it probably consists of different segments connecting these points. Since there are three points mentioned, maybe the function has two linear pieces? Let me think. 

Wait, the given points are A(-3,0), B(0,5), C(3,5), and D(7,9). Wait, but the question mentions the function going through (-3,0), (0,5), and (3,5). Oh, but there's also point D(7,9) listed. But the question specifically says the function goes through those first three points. Maybe D is part of another segment? Or perhaps the function continues beyond those points?

But the main thing here is the domain and range. Domain refers to all x-values the function covers, and range is all y-values. Since it's a piecewise function, I need to figure out how the function connects these points. 

Let me plot the points mentally. Point A is at (-3,0), B is at (0,5), C is at (3,5). So from A to B, then from B to C. Are there more points? The other points are D(7,9), but the question doesn't mention D being part of the function. Wait, the initial predicates list points A, B, C, D with lines connecting them. For example, A lies on line AB, B lies on line AB, then B lies on line BC, C lies on line BC, then C lies on CD, D lies on CD. So the line segments are AB, BC, CD. So the entire line would be from A to B to C to D. But the question says the function goes through A, B, and C. So maybe the function is made up of the segments AB, BC, and maybe CD? But the question says "going through" those three points, so maybe the function is AB followed by BC? Then CD isn't part of the function unless specified. 

But the problem states that the function is piecewise and passes through those three points. However, since the points are connected via lines, the function could consist of two parts: from A to B and then from B to C. So the domain would start at x=-3 (point A) and go up to x=3 (point C). But wait, if it's a piecewise function, maybe each segment is a separate piece. 

So the first piece is from A(-3,0) to B(0,5), which is a line segment. The second piece is from B(0,5) to C(3,5), which is a horizontal line. Therefore, the domain would be from x=-3 to x=3. Because the first segment goes from x=-3 to x=0, and the second from x=0 to x=3. So combined, the domain is [-3, 3]. 

Now for the range. The first segment goes from (-3,0) to (0,5). So y starts at 0 and increases to 5. The second segment is horizontal from (0,5) to (3,5), so y remains at 5. Therefore, the range would be from 0 up to 5, including 0 and 5. So the range is [0,5]. 

But wait, does the function have any other parts? The original problem mentions point D(7,9), but the question only asks about the function passing through A, B, and C. Unless the function continues beyond C to D, but the question doesn't specify that. The answer choices aren't given, but according to the instructions, there are no choices. But the user said to provide the answer in interval notation. 

Therefore, based on the given points A, B, and C, the domain is from x=-3 to x=3, so [-3, 3], and the range is from y=0 to y=5, so [0,5]. 

Wait, but the problem says it's a piecewise function. So if the function is defined only between those points, then yes. But maybe there's more? Like, if the function is extended beyond those points? But the question doesn't mention that. It just says the function goes through those points. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is composed of the lines AB, BC, and CD. But the question only mentions going through A, B, C. So CD is part of the same line? Let me check the coordinates. 

Point D is (7,9). Let's see the slope from C(3,5) to D(7,9): the rise is 9-5=4 over run 7-3=4, so slope is 1. The previous segment BC was from B(0,5) to C(3,5), which is horizontal (slope 0). So the function could be AB, BC, CD. But the question says the function goes through A, B, and C. So if the function includes CD, then the domain would extend beyond x=3. But the question didn't mention D. 

Hmm, but the original problem statement says "the piecewise function going through points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5)". So maybe the function stops at point C. Hence, the domain is from x=-3 to x=3. 

Thus, the domain is [-3,3] and the range is [0,5]. 

But the problem says "piecewise function", which usually means it's made of multiple pieces. In this case, two linear pieces: AB and BC. Each piece is a line segment. So the domain is from the leftmost x-value to the rightmost x-value, which is -3 to 3. 

Therefore, the domain is [-3, 3], and the range is [0, 5]. 

Since there are no answer choices provided, but the user instructed to select one of A-D, but since the answer choices are not present, perhaps the intended answer is to write the domain and range as intervals. However, the user might have intended for the answer to be selected from options A to D, but since they're not given, maybe the correct answer is that the domain is [-3, 3] and range [0,5]. 

But the user's instruction says "select the correct answer choice," implying there were choices, but they weren't included. So maybe there's confusion here. However, given the setup, the answer should be domain [-3,3] and range [0,5]. But without answer choices, I can't choose between A-D. However, since the user said to select one of A-D, but there are none, perhaps there was an error. But according to the problem statement, the answer choices are not found. 

In that case, the correct answer is domain [-3,3] and range [0,5]. But since the system requires selecting A-D, but there are no choices, perhaps the intended answer is something else. Alternatively, maybe the function is extended beyond C to D. Let me check. 

If the function continues past point C to D(7,9), then the domain would be from -3 to 7. Let's calculate the equation of CD. From point C(3,5) to D(7,9). Slope is (9-5)/(7-3)=4/4=1. Equation is y -5 = 1*(x-3), so y = x -3 +5 → y = x +2. So for x ≥3, y = x+2. 

Then, combining all three segments:

AB: from x=-3 to x=0, y = (5/3)x +5. Wait, let's compute the equation for AB. Points A(-3,0) and B(0,5). Slope m=(5-0)/(0 - (-3))=5/3. So equation is y = (5/3)(x +3). At x=-3, y=0; at x=0, y=5. 

BC: from x=0 to x=3, horizontal line at y=5. 

CD: from x=3 to x=7, y = x +2. 

So if the function includes all three segments, then the domain is from x=-3 to x=7. Then the range would be from the minimum y-value to maximum. The lowest y is 0 (at A), and highest is 9 (at D). So range [0,9]. 

But the question says the function goes through (-3,0), (0,5), and (3,5). Does that mean it includes the segment CD? The original problem's predicates include point D and line CD, but the question may not require considering D. 

This ambiguity exists because the problem mentions the function passes through those three points, but the given points include D. However, since the question specifies only the first three points, we shouldn't assume the function extends to D unless stated. 

Therefore, sticking strictly to the points mentioned in the question, the function has two segments: AB and BC. Thus, domain is [-3,3], range [0,5]. 

But the problem says "piecewise function", which often implies multiple pieces. However, even if it's two pieces, the domain and range would still be as above. 

But the presence of point D might suggest that the function continues beyond C. Without explicit mention, though, it's safer to consider only the given points. 

Given that, the answer would be domain [-3,3] and range [0,5]. Since there are no answer choices, but the user requires selecting one of A-D, perhaps there was an oversight. However, assuming that the correct answer is expected to be domain [-3,3] and range [0,5], which corresponds to certain choices if they existed. But since they don't, I'll proceed with the conclusion.
