MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So the question is about making a conical hat from a sector of cardboard. The sector has a radius of 24.0 units, and when formed into a cone, the base radius of the cone is 10.0 units. We need to find the area of the original sector.

First, I remember that when you make a cone from a sector, the radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. So the slant height (l) of the cone is equal to the radius of the sector. Here, the sector's radius is 24.0, so l = 24.0.

Next, the circumference of the base of the cone relates to the arc length of the sector. The base radius of the cone is given as 10.0. Let me recall the formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2πr. For the cone's base, the circumference would be 2π*10 = 20π. This should be equal to the arc length of the sector used to make the cone.

Now, the arc length (L) of a sector is given by L = θ*r, where θ is the central angle in radians and r is the radius of the sector. In this case, the arc length is 20π, and the radius is 24.0. So we can set up the equation:

20π = θ * 24

Solving for θ gives θ = 20π / 24 = 5π/6 radians.

Once we have the central angle, the area of the sector can be calculated. The formula for the area of a sector is (1/2)*θ*r². Plugging in the values:

Area = (1/2)*(5π/6)*(24)^2

Let me compute that. First, calculate 24 squared: 24^2 = 576.

Then multiply by 5π/6: (5π/6)*576. Let's divide 576 by 6 first: 576 ÷ 6 = 96. Then multiply by 5: 96*5 = 480. So it's 480π. Then multiply by 1/2? Wait, wait—the formula is (1/2)*θ*r². Wait, θ was already accounted for in the calculation above. Wait, let me redo that step carefully.

Wait, the formula is Area = (1/2) * θ * r². So substituting θ = 5π/6 and r = 24:

Area = 0.5 * (5π/6) * (24)^2

So breaking it down:

First, 24 squared is 576.

Multiply by 5π/6: 576*(5π/6) = (576/6)*5π = 96*5π = 480π.

Then multiply by 0.5: 480π * 0.5 = 240π.

Wait, but hold on. That would give 240π. But let me check if I did that correctly. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it.

Alternatively, since the area of the sector is also equal to (θ/(2π)) * πr², which simplifies to (θ/2)*r². Which is the same as before. So yes, same result.

But let me verify again. The sector area formula is (θ/2)*r². Since θ here is 5π/6, then:

(5π/6)/2 * 24² → Wait no, the formula is (θ/2)*r², so θ is 5π/6, so:

(5π/6) * (24²)/2 ?

Wait, no, the formula is (1/2)*θ*r². So θ is 5π/6, so:

(1/2) * (5π/6) * 24² = (5π/12) * 576 = 5π * (576/12) = 5π * 48 = 240π.

Yes, that's correct. So the area of the sector is 240π cm². Looking at the options, A is 240π, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me cross-validate. Another way to think: when you form the cone, the lateral surface area of the cone is equal to the area of the sector. The lateral surface area of a cone is πrl, where r is the base radius and l is the slant height. Here, r is 10, l is 24. So π*10*24 = 240π. Therefore, the area of the sector is equal to the lateral surface area of the cone, which is 240π. Hence, the answer is A.

That confirms the previous result. So the correct answer is A.
