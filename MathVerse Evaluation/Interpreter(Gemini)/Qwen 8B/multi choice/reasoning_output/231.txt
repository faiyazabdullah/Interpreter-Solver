MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given information and figure out how to find the measure of angle VXW. 

So, we have a circle with center X. The points Z, W, Y, and V are all on this circle because they're mentioned as lying on Circle(X). Also, ZW and YV are diameters of the circle. That means each of these lines passes through the center X, right? Because diameters go through the center and connect two points on the circle.

Now, the problem mentions some angles. Specifically, there's MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,W)) which equals Add(Mul(4,x),15) and MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,V)) which is Add(Mul(2,x),65). Also, it says these two measures are equal. So, setting them equal gives us an equation: 4x + 15 = 2x + 65. Solving for x would give me the value needed to compute the actual angles. Wait, but the question asks for m∠VXW, which is probably one of these angles or related to them. Let me make sure.

Wait, the angles mentioned are ∠YXW and ∠ZXV. But the question is about ∠VXW. Hmm. Let me visualize the diagram. Since ZW and YV are diameters, they cross at the center X. So, points Z and W are endpoints of one diameter, Y and V are endpoints of another. So, connecting those points would form intersecting diameters at X. 

Let me sketch mentally: circle with center X. Diameters ZW and YV intersect at X. So, point Z connected to W, and Y connected to V, crossing at X. Now, angle VXW is the angle at X between points V and W. Wait, so that's the angle formed at the center X by points V and W. But since YV is a diameter, V is one endpoint, and Y is the other. Similarly, ZW is a diameter, so W is one endpoint, Z is the other. 

But how do these points relate? Let me think. Since ZW and YV are diameters, they intersect at X. Therefore, the lines ZW and YV cross at the center X. So, the angle ∠VXW is formed between the lines XV (which is part of diameter YV) and XW (part of diameter ZW). So, this angle is between the two diameters. 

But wait, if ZW and YV are diameters, then they intersect at X. Depending on the position of the diameters, the angle between them could vary. However, the problem gives expressions for two angles: ∠YXW and ∠ZXV, which are equal. Let me parse that again. 

The first angle is ∠YXW, which is at point X, between points Y and W. The second angle is ∠ZXV, at point X between points Z and V. And these two angles are equal. Also, their measures are given as 4x+15 and 2x+65 respectively. Setting them equal gives 4x + 15 = 2x + 65 → 2x = 50 → x=25. Then substituting back, each angle measure would be 4*25 +15 = 115° and 2*25 +65= 115°, confirming equality. 

But the question is asking for m∠VXW. Let me see where that angle is. ∠VXW is at point X, between points V and W. Looking at the diagram, since YV is a diameter, V is one end, Y is the other. ZW is a diameter, so W is one end, Z is the other. The angle between XV (from X to V) and XW (from X to W) is ∠VXW. 

But since ZW and YV are diameters intersecting at X, the angle between them depends on their orientation. However, the problem gives us the measures of ∠YXW and ∠ZXV, which are equal. Let me think about these angles. 

For example, ∠YXW is the angle at X between Y and W. Since Y is on one diameter (YV) and W is on another diameter (ZW). So, if we imagine the two diameters crossing at X, forming vertical angles. Suppose the diameters are not perpendicular. Then, the angles between them would depend on their arrangement. 

But here, since ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are equal, maybe there's a relationship between these angles and the angle we need (∠VXW). Let me try to analyze. 

Since ZW and YV are diameters, the lines ZW and YV pass through X. So, the four points Z, W, Y, V lie on the circle, with X being the center. So, the lines ZW and YV are straight lines passing through X. 

Therefore, the angle between diameters ZW and YV is determined by the angle between lines ZW and YV. Let me consider that. The angle between two diameters would be the angle between their respective lines. For instance, if we look at the angle between ZW and YV at point X, that's the angle between the two diameters. 

But how does that relate to ∠YXW and ∠ZXV? Let's take ∠YXW: this is at X, between Y and W. Since Y is on YV (a diameter) and W is on ZW (another diameter). So, the angle between YX and WX. Similarly, ∠ZXV is at X between Z and V. Z is on ZW and V is on YV. 

But since ZW and YV are diameters, the lines ZW and YV are straight lines through X. Therefore, the angle between ZW and YV is split into several angles around point X. Each pair of adjacent angles would sum up to 180 degrees if they are supplementary. 

Alternatively, since the total around a point is 360 degrees, the sum of all angles around X would be 360. However, since there are two diameters, they divide the circle into four angles. These four angles are either equal or depend on the angle between the diameters. 

Suppose the angle between diameters ZW and YV is θ. Then, the opposite angle would also be θ, and the other two angles would be 180° - θ. Wait, no—if two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. So, if the angle between ZW and YV is θ, then the opposite angle is also θ, and the adjacent angles are 180° - θ. 

But in our case, the problem states that ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are equal. Let me try to identify these angles. 

Take ∠YXW: This is formed by points Y, X, W. So, starting from Y, going to X, then to W. Since Y is on YV (diameter), and W is on ZW (diameter). So, this angle is between YX and WX. Similarly, ∠ZXV is between ZX and VX. 

But since ZW is a diameter, Z and W are endpoints. So, Z is directly opposite W. Similarly, Y and V are endpoints of the other diameter. So, depending on how the diameters are arranged, these angles could be related. 

Let me assume that the two diameters ZW and YV intersect at X. So, the angle between them is some value. Let me denote the angle between ZW and YV as α. Then, the vertical angles formed would be α and its supplement (if they are not overlapping). 

Wait, but perhaps the angles ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are actually the same as the angles between the diameters. Let me think. 

If I consider ∠YXW: since Y is on YV (so XY is half of YV) and W is on ZW (so XW is half of ZW). Therefore, the angle between XY and XW is ∠YXW. Similarly, ∠ZXV is between XZ and XV. Since ZW is a diameter, XZ is a radius opposite to XW. So, XZ and XW are in opposite directions along the same line. Similarly, XV is a radius in the direction of YV. 

Wait, maybe there's symmetry here. Let me try to visualize. Suppose the two diameters ZW and YV cross at X. Then, the angle between them is θ. So, the angle between ZW and YV is θ. Then, the angle between ZW and YV would be θ, and the opposite angle would also be θ. The other two angles would be 180° - θ. 

But how do ∠YXW and ∠ZXV fit into this? Let me take ∠YXW. Point Y is on YV, so XY is part of diameter YV. Point W is on ZW, so XW is part of diameter ZW. Therefore, ∠YXW is the angle between XY (along YV) and XW (along ZW). Which would be one of the angles formed by the intersection of the two diameters. Similarly, ∠ZXV is the angle between XZ (opposite to XW) and XV (along YV). 

But since XZ is opposite to XW, then the angle between XZ and XV would be supplementary to the angle between XW and XV. Wait, maybe. Let me think. If two diameters intersect, then each pair of opposite angles are equal. So, if ∠YXW is one angle, then the opposite angle would be ∠ZXV. Wait, but according to the problem, these two angles are equal. 

Wait, the problem says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(Y,X,W)),MeasureOf(Angle(Z,X,V))). So, ∠YXW equals ∠ZXV. But if these are vertical angles, then they should be equal regardless. But why is that given? Maybe my previous assumption is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are adjacent angles that add up to something. Let me try to calculate. 

Assuming that the two diameters ZW and YV intersect at X, creating four angles around X. Let me call the angle between ZW and YV as α. Then, the vertical angles are α and α, and the other two angles are 180° - α. 

But ∠YXW would be one of these angles. Let me clarify. If I imagine standing at point X, looking towards Y (on YV) and W (on ZW), then ∠YXW is the angle between YX and WX. Depending on the direction, this could be α or 180° - α. Similarly, ∠ZXV would be the angle between ZX (opposite to WX) and XV (same as YX). So, if the angle between YX and WX is α, then the angle between ZX and XV would be the same as the angle between YX and WX, but maybe supplementary. 

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try to assign variables. Let’s say the angle between diameters ZW and YV is θ. Then, the vertical angles are θ and θ, and the other two angles are 180° - θ. 

Now, ∠YXW is formed by points Y, X, W. So, if we consider Y on YV and W on ZW, then ∠YXW is the angle between YX and WX. If the angle between diameters ZW and YV is θ, then this angle could be θ or 180° - θ. Similarly, ∠ZXV is the angle between ZX and XV. Since ZX is the opposite of WX (because ZW is a diameter), then the angle between ZX and XV would be the same as the angle between WX and XV, which would be supplementary to θ. Wait, maybe not. 

Alternatively, suppose the two diameters form angles θ and 180° - θ. Then, ∠YXW could be θ, and ∠ZXV could be 180° - θ. But the problem says these two angles are equal. So, θ = 180° - θ → θ = 90°, making them both right angles. But that contradicts the earlier equations unless x is such that 4x+15=2x+65 leads to x=25, giving angles of 115°, which doesn't align with 90°. So this suggests my initial assumption is incorrect. 

Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine the setup. 

Given that ZW and YV are diameters, so they intersect at X. The problem gives two angles: ∠YXW and ∠ZXV, which are equal. Their measures are given as 4x +15 and 2x +65, leading to x=25, so each angle is 115°. 

But how does this relate to ∠VXW? Let me consider that ∠VXW is the angle at X between V and W. So, points V, X, W. Since V is on YV (a diameter) and W is on ZW (another diameter). So, the angle between XV and XW. 

But XV is part of diameter YV, and XW is part of diameter ZW. So, this angle is the same as the angle between the two diameters ZW and YV. Wait, because XV is along YV, and XW is along ZW. So, ∠VXW is the angle between diameters ZW and YV. 

Earlier, I thought that this angle was θ, and the other angles were 180° - θ. But the problem says that ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are equal. Let me think again. 

Let’s suppose that the angle between diameters ZW and YV is θ. Then, the vertical angles formed are θ and θ, while the other two angles are 180° - θ. 

Now, ∠YXW: if we consider YX (along YV) and WX (along ZW), then this angle would be θ or 180° - θ depending on the direction. Similarly, ∠ZXV would involve ZX (opposite to WX) and XV (along YV). So, ZX is in the opposite direction of WX, so the angle between ZX and XV would be the same as the angle between WX and XV, which would be supplementary to θ. 

Wait, if the angle between WX and XV is 180° - θ, then ∠ZXV would be 180° - θ. But the problem says that ∠YXW equals ∠ZXV. Therefore, θ = 180° - θ → θ = 90°. But earlier calculations gave us angles of 115°, which contradicts this. Hence, my previous reasoning is flawed. 

Maybe I need to re-express the angles in terms of θ. Let me try again. 

Assume that the angle between diameters ZW and YV is θ. At point X, the four angles formed are θ, 180° - θ, θ, and 180° - θ. 

Now, ∠YXW is formed by YX (along YV) and WX (along ZW). Depending on the direction, this angle could be θ or 180° - θ. Similarly, ∠ZXV is formed by ZX (opposite to WX) and XV (along YV). Since ZX is opposite to WX, the angle between ZX and XV would be the same as the angle between WX and XV. 

But the angle between WX and XV would be the same as the angle between ZW and YV. Wait, no. If XV is along YV, and WX is along ZW, then the angle between WX and XV is θ. So, ∠YXW would be θ. Meanwhile, ∠ZXV is the angle between ZX (opposite to WX) and XV (along YV). Since ZX is in the opposite direction of WX, the angle between ZX and XV would be the same as the angle between WX and XV plus 180°, but that doesn’t make sense. 

Alternatively, considering that ∠ZXV is formed by ZX and XV. Since ZW is a diameter, Z is opposite to W. So, the line ZW goes through X, so ZX is a radius in the opposite direction of WX. Therefore, the angle between ZX and XV would be the supplement of the angle between WX and XV. 

Wait, if the angle between WX and XV is θ, then the angle between ZX and XV would be 180° - θ. But the problem states that ∠YXW equals ∠ZXV. So, θ = 180° - θ → θ = 90°. But according to the given expressions, θ is 115°, which conflicts. 

This suggests that my understanding of which angles correspond to which parts is incorrect. Perhaps I need to revisit the definitions of the angles. 

Let me define the angles more carefully. 

∠YXW: This is the angle at X between Y and W. So, segments XY and XW. Since Y is on diameter YV and W is on diameter ZW. So, XY is a radius pointing towards Y, and XW is a radius pointing towards W. The angle between these two radii is ∠YXW. 

Similarly, ∠ZXV is the angle at X between Z and V. So, segments XZ and XV. XZ is a radius pointing towards Z (end of diameter ZW), and XV is a radius pointing towards V (end of diameter YV). 

So, these two angles are formed by different pairs of radii. Let me think of the entire configuration. 

If we have two diameters ZW and YV intersecting at X, then the four points Z, W, Y, V are on the circle. The angle ∠YXW is between YX and WX. The angle ∠ZXV is between ZX and XV. 

But since ZW and YV are diameters, Z is opposite W, and Y is opposite V. 

Let me consider the full circle. The angle between YX and WX would depend on the arc between Y and W. Similarly, the angle between ZX and XV would depend on the arc between Z and V. 

But since ZW and YV are diameters, the arcs they subtend are semicircles. 

However, without knowing the exact positions, maybe there's a relation between these angles. 

But the problem gives us that ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are equal. From earlier, solving 4x +15 = 2x +65 gives x=25, so each angle is 115°. 

So, ∠YXW = 115° and ∠ZXV = 115°. 

Now, the question is to find m∠VXW. As per earlier, this is the angle at X between V and W. So, between XV and XW. 

Let me consider that. The angle between XV (along YV) and XW (along ZW) is ∠VXW. How can I find this angle?

If I know the other angles, maybe I can use the fact that the sum of angles around a point is 360°. 

Let me think: the four angles around point X are ∠YXW, ∠ZXV, and others. Wait, but how many angles are there? When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. So, there are four angles: two of measure α and two of measure β, where α + β = 180°. 

But in this case, we have two angles given: ∠YXW and ∠ZXV, which are equal. So, if these are vertical angles, then they are equal, which fits. Or they could be adjacent angles. 

Wait, but if ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are vertical angles, then they are equal, which matches the given condition. So, that would mean that the two diameters intersect such that the vertical angles are equal, implying that the lines are perpendicular? No, because vertical angles are always equal regardless of the angle between the lines. 

Wait, but if ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are vertical angles, then they are equal, which is consistent. But in that case, the other two angles would be supplementary to them. 

So, the total around point X is 360°. If ∠YXW and ∠ZXV are each 115°, then the other two angles would be 360 - 2*115 = 130°, so each of those angles is 130° / 2 = 65°? Wait, no. Wait, there are two angles of 115° and two angles that are equal. Wait, if two vertical angles are 115°, then the other two vertical angles would be 360 - 2*115 = 130°, so each of those would be 130°, but since they are vertical angles, they are equal. Wait, that would mean that the two angles are 115° and 130°, but that doesn't add up to 360. Wait, 115 + 115 + 130 + 130 = 490°, which exceeds 360. So, that can't be. 

Ah, no. If two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles. So, if one pair is 115°, the other pair must be 180° - 115° = 65°, because the sum of adjacent angles is 180°. 

Wait, yes! When two lines intersect, the sum of adjacent angles is 180°. So, if one angle is 115°, the adjacent angle is 65°, and the vertical angles are equal. So, if ∠YXW is 115°, then the angle adjacent to it is 65°, and the other vertical angle is also 115°, and the remaining angle is 65°. 

So, the four angles around X are 115°, 65°, 115°, 65°, totaling 360°. 

Now, the question is asking for m∠VXW. Let me determine which angle this is. 

∠VXW is the angle at X between V and W. So, points V, X, W. XV is along the diameter YV (since V is on YV), and XW is along diameter ZW. So, this angle is between XV (along YV) and XW (along ZW). 

Looking at the four angles around X, which one corresponds to this? It depends on the arrangement of the diameters. Let me try to imagine: 

Imagine two diameters intersecting at X. One diameter is YV, going from Y to V. Another is ZW, going from Z to W. The angle between XV (part of YV) and XW (part of ZW) would be one of the angles formed by the intersection. 

If ∠YXW is 115°, then that's the angle between YX and WX. Let's assume that YX is along YV towards Y, and WX is along ZW towards W. So, this angle is between YX (towards Y) and WX (towards W). 

Meanwhile, ∠ZXV is between ZX (towards Z) and XV (towards V). Since ZW is a diameter, Z is opposite to W. So, ZX is in the opposite direction of WX. Thus, the angle between ZX and XV would be the same as the angle between WX and XV, but since ZX is opposite to WX, it might be supplementary. 

Wait, but earlier we said that the angles around X are 115°, 65°, 115°, 65°. So, the angle between XV and XW is either 115° or 65°, depending on the arrangement. 

But how to determine which one it is? 

Let me think: if ∠YXW is 115°, that's the angle between YX and WX. So, YX is along YV towards Y, and WX is along ZW towards W. If I'm at point X, facing Y (along YV), then turning towards W (along ZW), the angle between those directions is 115°. 

Then, the angle between XV (which is the same as YX, since YV is a diameter) and XW would be the same as ∠YXW, which is 115°. Wait, but that would imply that ∠VXW is 115°, which would be one of the answer choices (option C). But let me check if that's accurate. 

Wait, ∠VXW is at X between V and W. So, XV is along YV towards V, and XW is along ZW towards W. So, this angle is the same as ∠YXW, which is 115°, because YX is along YV towards Y, and XV is along YV towards V. Wait, but that would mean that the angle between XV and XW is the same as ∠YXW? No, because ∠YXW is between YX (towards Y) and WX (towards W), whereas ∠VXW is between XV (towards V) and XW (towards W). 

But since YV is a diameter, moving from Y to V, so XV is in the direction from X to V, which is the opposite of YX. So, YX and XV are in opposite directions. Therefore, the angle between YX and WX is supplementary to the angle between XV and WX. 

Because if you have two lines: one going from X to Y (YX) and another going from X to V (XV), which are in opposite directions along the same line (YV). So, if ∠YXW is the angle between YX and WX, then the angle between XV and WX would be 180° minus ∠YXW. 

So, since ∠YXW is 115°, then the angle between XV and WX (which is ∠VXW) would be 180° - 115° = 65°. 

Wait, that makes sense. Because YX and XV are opposite directions along the same diameter, so the angle between YX and WX is supplementary to the angle between XV and WX. 

Thus, m∠VXW = 180° - 115° = 65°. 

But wait, let me confirm. If ∠YXW is 115°, then the angle between YX and WX is 115°. Since YX and XV are in opposite directions, the angle between XV and WX would be 180° - 115° = 65°, which is the measure of ∠VXW. 

So, the answer would be 65°, which is option B. 

But let me verify this conclusion with the given data. We found x=25, and ∠YXW = 4x+15 = 115°, which is correct. Then, the angle we want, ∠VXW, is 180° - 115° = 65°, which is option B. 

But wait, the answer options are A:25, B:65, C:115, D:180. So, 65 is option B. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to look at it. Let me check if there's a possibility that the angle is 115°, but that seems conflicting with the calculation above. 

Another way: since the two diameters form angles of 115° and 65°, then ∠VXW could be one of these. If ∠VXW is the smaller angle, then it's 65°, which would be option B. 

Yes, this makes sense. So, the answer is B:65.
