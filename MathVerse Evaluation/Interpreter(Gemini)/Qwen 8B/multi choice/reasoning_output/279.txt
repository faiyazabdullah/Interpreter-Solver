====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have a quadrilateral RQTS. The problem says that angle R equals angle T, both measured as x degrees. Then there are some other angles given in terms of x. Let me parse all the given information step by step.

First, the quadrilateral has four points: R, Q, T, S. The measures of the angles at each vertex are given. Specifically:

- Measure of angle R is x.
- Measure of angle Q is 2x + 5.
- Measure of angle T is x.
- Measure of angle S is 2x + 7.

Also, it's stated that the sum of all these angles equals 360 degrees because they're the interior angles of a quadrilateral. Additionally, it's given that angle R equals angle T, which we already know since both are x. 

So, my goal is to find the measure of angle R, which is x. To do this, I need to set up an equation using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees.

Let me write down the equation:

Angle R + Angle Q + Angle T + Angle S = 360°

Substituting the expressions given:

x + (2x + 5) + x + (2x + 7) = 360

Now, combine like terms. Let's add up the x terms and the constants separately.

For the x terms: x + 2x + x + 2x = 6x

For the constants: 5 + 7 = 12

So the equation becomes:

6x + 12 = 360

To solve for x, subtract 12 from both sides:

6x = 360 - 12  
6x = 348

Then divide both sides by 6:

x = 348 / 6  
x = 58

Wait, but let me check if I did that correctly. 6 times 58 is 348? Let me compute 6*50=300, 6*8=48, so 300+48=348. Yes, that's correct. So x is 58 degrees. But wait, looking at the answer choices, option A is 58. However, sometimes problems can have tricks, so let me make sure I didn't misread anything.

Wait, the problem states that angle R equals angle T, which we used here. Also, the angles for Q and S are expressed as 2x + 5 and 2x +7 respectively. So substituting those gives us the equation above. Let me confirm once again:

Sum of angles: x + (2x+5) + x + (2x+7) = 6x +12 = 360 → 6x=348 → x=58. That seems right.

But wait, the answer options include 58 as option A. So why would there be confusion? Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation?

Alternatively, maybe there's something about the type of quadrilateral? Wait, the problem says Quadrilateral(R,Q,T,S). It doesn't specify if it's a parallelogram, trapezoid, etc., but since the angles are given in terms of x, perhaps it's a general quadrilateral. So the sum of interior angles being 360 is always true regardless of the type. Therefore, the calculation should hold.

Therefore, x is 58 degrees, which corresponds to answer choice A. Hmm. But let me check the answer choices again. The options are A:58, B:60, C:122, D:124. So 58 is option A. But sometimes problems may involve supplementary angles or other relations. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: could there be an error in interpreting the angle measures? For example, maybe angle Q is 2x +5, angle S is 2x +7. Let me recheck the original problem statement. 

Yes, the user wrote:

MeasureOf(Angle(Q),Add(Mul(2,x),5)) → so angle Q is 2x +5.

MeasureOf(Angle(S),Add(Mul(2,x),7)) → angle S is 2x +7.

So adding them up: x (R) + (2x+5) (Q) + x (T) + (2x+7) (S) = total 6x +12. Correct.

Thus, solving gives x=58. Therefore, answer A. But let me check if there's another way this could be approached. For instance, if the quadrilateral was cyclic? Wait, but there's no mention of cyclic quadrilaterals here. Unless the problem implies something else. However, the problem does not state that the quadrilateral is cyclic, so we can't assume that. Hence, the standard sum of interior angles applies.

Another check: suppose x=58. Then angle Q is 2*58 +5 = 116 +5 = 121 degrees. Angle S is 2*58 +7 = 116 +7 = 123 degrees. Summing all angles: 58 + 121 + 58 + 123 = 58+58=116; 121+123=244; total 116+244=360. Perfect, adds up. So that works. Thus, x=58 is correct.

But why is there an option C:122? Maybe someone might think that since angles Q and S are 2x +5 and 2x +7, perhaps there's a relationship where those angles are supplementary or something else. But unless there's more info, that's not applicable. So I think the correct answer is A:58. Therefore, the Final Answer should be A.
