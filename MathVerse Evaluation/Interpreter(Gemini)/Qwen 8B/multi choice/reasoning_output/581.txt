====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the question is about determining whether a certain function has an inverse, given that it passes through the points (0,-2), (3,0), and starts from (-1,-5). Hmm. 

First, I remember that a function has an inverse if and only if it is bijective, which means it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). But since we're dealing with real functions here, maybe the main concern is whether the function is one-to-one, because surjectivity onto the codomain might depend on the context. However, typically, for inverses, the primary condition is being strictly monotonic—either always increasing or always decreasing. Because if a function is strictly increasing or decreasing, it's one-to-one, hence invertible.

But wait, how do we know the behavior of the function? The problem mentions that the graph passes through those three points: (0,-2), (3,0), and starts from (-1,-5). Let me plot these points mentally. Starting at (-1, -5), then going through (0, -2), then (3, 0). Wait, but does that mean the function is continuous? Well, the term "starts from" suggests continuity, perhaps? Or maybe it's just passing through those points. But without knowing the exact nature of the function, like if it's a straight line, quadratic, cubic, etc., it's hard to tell. But the problem says "function graphed below," implying there's a graph, but since I don't have the graph, I need to infer based on the given points.

Wait, but the initial part mentioned some predicates. Let me check again. The user provided some point-on-line predicates and a shape curve. Oh, but maybe the function is a curve? The Shape predicate says Shape(Curve), so it's a curve. But how does that affect things?

So the key thing is whether the function is one-to-one. To check that, we need to see if it's strictly increasing or decreasing over its domain. But with only three points, it's hard to tell unless we can find more information. Let me think. Suppose the function is a straight line. Then, if it passes through (0,-2) and (3,0), it would have a slope of (0 - (-2))/(3 - 0) = 2/3. Then, checking if (-1,-5) lies on that line. Let's calculate. For x=-1, y should be -2 + (2/3)(-1 - 0) = -2 - 2/3 = -8/3 ≈ -2.666..., but the point given is (-1,-5), which is much lower. So that doesn't lie on the line connecting (0,-2) and (3,0). Therefore, the function isn't a straight line. Hence, it's a curve.

Now, considering that the function starts at (-1,-5), goes through (0,-2), then (3,0). Let's imagine the path. From x=-1 to x=0, moving from (-1,-5) to (0,-2): that's an increase in x by 1, and y increases by 3. Then from x=0 to x=3, moving from (0,-2) to (3,0): x increases by 3, y increases by 2. So the slope between (-1,-5) and (0,-2) is ( -2 - (-5) ) / (0 - (-1)) = 3/1 = 3. The slope between (0,-2) and (3,0) is (0 - (-2))/(3 - 0) = 2/3. So the slope changes from 3 to 2/3. That suggests that the function is not linear. But even more importantly, if the function is not monotonic, it could fail the horizontal line test, meaning it's not one-to-one, thus no inverse.

But how can we determine if it's monotonic? Since we have two different slopes between those intervals. Wait, but maybe the function is a cubic or something else. However, even if it's a cubic, depending on its turning points, it could have regions where it increases and decreases. For example, if between x=-1 and x=0 it's increasing with a steep slope, then between x=0 and x=3 it's increasing but less steep. In that case, the entire function is still increasing, so it's one-to-one. But if there's a local maximum or minimum between those points, then it might decrease somewhere, making it not one-to-one.

But how can we know? The problem gives us three points but no information about other points. However, the fact that the function "starts from (-1,-5)" might imply that it's defined for x ≤ 3, but maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the function is a parabola? Let's consider that. Suppose it's a quadratic function. Then, the vertex would be at some point. But with three points, we can fit a quadratic. Let me try that. Let me assume the function is quadratic: f(x) = ax² + bx + c.

We have three points: (-1, -5), (0, -2), (3, 0).

Plugging in (0, -2): f(0) = c = -2.

So c = -2. Now plug in (-1, -5):

a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c = a - b - 2 = -5 → a - b = -3 → equation 1: a - b = -3.

Then plug in (3, 0):

a(9) + b(3) + c = 9a + 3b - 2 = 0 → 9a + 3b = 2 → divide by 3: 3a + b = 2/3 → equation 2: 3a + b = 2/3.

Now solve equations 1 and 2:

From equation 1: a = b - 3.

Substitute into equation 2: 3(b - 3) + b = 2/3 → 3b - 9 + b = 2/3 → 4b = 2/3 + 9 → convert 9 to thirds: 27/3. So 4b = (2 + 27)/3 = 29/3 → b = 29/(3*4) = 29/12 ≈ 2.416...

Then a = b - 3 = 29/12 - 36/12 = -7/12 ≈ -0.583...

So the quadratic would be f(x) = (-7/12)x² + (29/12)x - 2.

Let me check if this quadratic passes through all three points. At x=3: f(3)= (-7/12)(9) + (29/12)(3) - 2 = (-63/12) + (87/12) - 2 = (24/12) - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0. Correct. At x=0, f(0)= -2. Correct. At x=-1: f(-1)= (-7/12)(1) + (29/12)(-1) - 2 = (-7/12 -29/12) -2 = (-36/12) -2 = -3 -2 = -5. Correct. So yes, this quadratic fits the three points.

Now, for a quadratic function, it's a parabola. The direction depends on the coefficient a. Here, a = -7/12 < 0, so it opens downward. Therefore, the function has a maximum at its vertex. The vertex occurs at x = -b/(2a). Let's compute that.

x = -(29/12)/(2*(-7/12)) = -(29/12) / (-14/12) = (29/12) / (14/12) = 29/14 ≈ 2.071.

So the vertex is at x ≈ 2.071. Which is between x=0 and x=3. Therefore, the function increases up to x≈2.071, then decreases afterward. Thus, the function is not monotonic over its entire domain. Therefore, it fails the horizontal line test. For example, there exists some y-value that corresponds to two different x-values. Therefore, it's not one-to-one, so it doesn't have an inverse.

But wait, the original problem didn't specify that the function is a quadratic. It just said it's a curve passing through those points. But assuming it's a quadratic gives us a scenario where it's not one-to-one. However, maybe the function is not a quadratic. What if it's another type of curve? Like a cubic?

Suppose it's a cubic function. Let's say it's a cubic polynomial. But with three points, we can't uniquely determine a cubic; we'd need four points. However, even if it's a cubic, the behavior could vary. For instance, if the cubic is increasing throughout, then it's one-to-one. But if it has turning points, then it's not. However, without more information, we can't be sure. 

But the problem states that the function "starts from (-1,-5)". Maybe that implies that the function is defined starting at x=-1 and extending to the right? Or maybe it's a parametric curve? Without more info, it's hard to tell. However, the key clue here might be that the function passes through those three points and the question is about having an inverse. 

Another way to think: regardless of the function's form, if the function is not strictly increasing or decreasing over its entire domain, it cannot have an inverse. So even if it's a cubic with only one turning point, if it's increasing overall, then it's okay. But if it has any turning points, then it's not strictly increasing/decreasing. 

But how can we determine if there's a turning point? Well, the fact that the function starts at (-1,-5), goes through (0,-2), then (3,0). If the function were strictly increasing, then each subsequent point would have higher x and higher y. Let's check the y-values: from (-1,-5) to (0,-2): y increases from -5 to -2, so positive change. Then from (0,-2) to (3,0): y increases from -2 to 0. So overall, y is increasing. However, the rate of increase changed from 3 units over 1 unit (slope 3) to 2 units over 3 units (slope 2/3). This suggests that the function is increasing but slowing down. But if there's a turning point, the function might start decreasing. 

However, with only three points, we can't definitively say there's a turning point. Unless we can show that the function must have a turning point. For example, if the function is a quadratic, as we saw earlier, there is a turning point. But if it's a different kind of curve, maybe not. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to a function that's a piecewise combination. But without more info, it's tricky. However, the presence of three points with varying slopes suggests that the function might not be monotonic. But how can we conclude that?

Wait, but the problem says "the function graphed below". Since we don't have the graph, but we have three points. Let me think again. The key idea is that for a function to have an inverse, it needs to pass the horizontal line test. If the graph crosses a horizontal line more than once, then it's not one-to-one. Given that the function starts at (-1,-5), goes through (0,-2), then (3,0), we can imagine that between x=-1 and x=3, the function is increasing. But if it's a quadratic, as shown earlier, it peaks around x≈2.07, then decreases. So between x=2.07 and x=3, it's decreasing. Therefore, there's a region where the function is decreasing. Thus, the horizontal line test would fail. For example, take the y-value at x=2.07, which is the maximum. There would be two x-values corresponding to that y: one before the peak and one after. Hence, the function is not injective, so no inverse. 

But if the function is strictly increasing over the entire domain, then it would have an inverse. How can we decide? Well, the problem gives us three points. If the function is strictly increasing, then the slope between any two points should be positive. But we have two different slopes: from (-1,-5) to (0,-2) is positive (slope 3), and from (0,-2) to (3,0) is also positive (slope 2/3). However, this doesn't guarantee that the function is strictly increasing everywhere. For example, the function could have a negative slope between some other points not given. But since we only have three points, we can't be sure. 

But maybe there's another approach. The problem mentions that the function is a curve. If it's a curve that is not a straight line, it might have inflection points or turning points. But again, without more info, it's ambiguous. However, in standard math problems like this, especially in exams, sometimes they expect you to consider the possibility of a quadratic or other standard curves. Since the three points can define a quadratic, and that quadratic has a peak, leading to non-injective, then the answer would be No. 

Therefore, the safest assumption is that the function is not monotonic, hence no inverse. Therefore, the answer should be B: No.
