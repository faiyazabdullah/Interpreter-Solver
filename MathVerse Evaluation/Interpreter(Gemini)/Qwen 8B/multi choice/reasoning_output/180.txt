MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. So, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle O, which means it's a circumscribed circle or circumcircle. The radius of the circle is 1.0 units. 

Looking at the points, there are several lines mentioned: OA, OB, OC, OD, and others. Also, some perpendicularity conditions. For example, Line(O,C) is perpendicular to Line(O,B). Wait, but O is the center of the circle, so OA, OB, OC are radii. Since the radius is 1, each of those segments has length 1. But if OC is perpendicular to OB, that would mean that angle COB is 90 degrees. Similarly, OD is perpendicular to AB. 

OD intersects AC at point E, and since OD is perpendicular to AB, maybe that creates some right triangles. Also, E lies on AC because of the IntersectAt predicate. 

Now, the question asks for AE² + CE². Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe coordinate geometry? Or use vectors? Alternatively, since everything is in a circle, perhaps applying power of a point, or properties of chords?

Wait, since ABC is inscribed in the circle with center O, and O is the circumcenter. But wait, in a triangle, the circumcenter is where the perpendicular bisectors meet. However, here they mention that OC is perpendicular to OB. That suggests that angle COB is 90 degrees. Since OB and OC are radii, triangle COB is a right-angled isoceles triangle? Because OB=OC=1, and angle between them is 90 degrees. Therefore, CB would be sqrt(2) in length. But maybe that's not directly helpful yet.

Also, OD is perpendicular to AB. So OD is an altitude from O to AB? Wait, but O is the center. Wait, but OD is a line starting at O and going through D, which is on AB. Wait, according to the predicate PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(A,B)) — yes, D is a point on AB. And OD is perpendicular to AB. So OD is the perpendicular from O to AB. Therefore, D is the foot of the perpendicular from O to AB. 

Since AB is a chord of the circle, the line OD is the perpendicular from the center to the chord AB. In a circle, the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord. Therefore, AD = DB. Wait, but does that hold here? Wait, but AB is a chord, and OD is perpendicular to AB at D. Then D is the midpoint of AB. So AD = DB. But then, since E is the intersection of OD with AC, maybe there's something about coordinates here.

Alternatively, maybe coordinate system approach. Let me try setting up coordinates. Let’s place O at the origin (0,0). Since OC is perpendicular to OB, and both are radii of length 1. Let me assign coordinates such that O is (0,0). Let me take OB along x-axis and OC along y-axis. So point B is (1,0), point C is (0,1). Then, since ABC is a triangle inscribed in the circle. So points A, B, C lie on the circle centered at O with radius 1. 

But where is point A? Well, since AB is a chord, and D is the foot of perpendicular from O to AB. Also, E is the intersection of OD with AC. Let me find coordinates for point A. Let me assume coordinates for A. Since ABC is a triangle inscribed in the circle. Let me see. Let me suppose point A is somewhere on the circle. Let me parametrize it. Suppose A is (x,y) such that x² + y² = 1. 

Then, line AB connects A(x,y) to B(1,0). The equation of line AB can be found. The slope of AB is (0 - y)/(1 - x) = -y/(1 - x). The line OD is perpendicular to AB, so its slope is the negative reciprocal of that, which is (1 - x)/y. Since OD passes through O(0,0), its equation is y = [(1 - x)/y] * x. Wait, but that seems messy. Alternatively, since D lies on AB and OD is perpendicular to AB. 

Let me compute coordinates of D. Since D is the foot of perpendicular from O(0,0) to AB. The formula for foot of perpendicular from a point to a line. The line AB goes through points A(x,y) and B(1,0). The vector form of AB is (1 - x, -y). The parametric equations for AB can be written as (x + t(1 - x), y + t(-y)), but maybe better to use standard line equation.

Equation of line AB: Let me write it as ax + by + c = 0. But maybe easier to use parametric form. Alternatively, using projection formula. The coordinates of D can be computed as follows:

Given line AB, point O(0,0), find D as the foot of perpendicular from O to AB. 

The formula for the foot of perpendicular from point P(p_x,p_y) to line passing through points M(m_x,m_y) and N(n_x,n_y) is a bit involved, but since O is (0,0), and line AB passes through A(x_A, y_A) and B(x_B, y_B), then the coordinates of D can be found using projection.

Alternatively, since we know that vector OD is perpendicular to AB. Vector AB is (1 - x, -y). Vector OD is (d_x, d_y), which should satisfy (d_x)(1 - x) + (d_y)(-y) = 0. Also, D lies on AB. Parametrize AB: D can be expressed as A + t*(B - A) = (x + t(1 - x), y + t(-y)). So coordinates of D are (x + t(1 - x), y - ty).

So substituting into the dot product condition: OD · AB = 0. So:

[d_x]*(1 - x) + [d_y]*(-y) = 0.

But d_x = x + t(1 - x), d_y = y - ty.

Therefore,

[x + t(1 - x)]*(1 - x) + [y - ty]*(-y) = 0.

Expanding:

x(1 - x) + t(1 - x)^2 - y^2 + t y^2 = 0.

Group terms with t:

t[(1 - x)^2 + y^2] + [x(1 - x) - y^2] = 0.

Solving for t:

t = [y^2 - x(1 - x)] / [(1 - x)^2 + y^2].

Hmm, complicated. But since A lies on the unit circle, x² + y² = 1. Let me substitute that. 

First, denominator:

(1 - x)^2 + y^2 = 1 - 2x + x² + y² = 1 - 2x + (x² + y²) = 1 - 2x + 1 = 2(1 - x).

Numerator: y² - x(1 - x) = y² - x + x². Since x² + y² = 1, replace y² = 1 - x². So numerator becomes (1 - x²) - x + x² = 1 - x² - x + x² = 1 - x.

Thus, t = (1 - x) / [2(1 - x)] ) = 1/2. 

Wow! So regardless of x, t = 1/2. Therefore, D is the midpoint of AB. Wait, that's interesting. Because t = 1/2 implies that D divides AB in half. Hence, D is the midpoint of AB. Which aligns with the property that the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord. 

So D is the midpoint of AB. Therefore, AD = DB. Now, since E is the intersection of OD and AC. So E lies on AC and on OD. 

We need to find AE² + CE². Let me think. Since E is on AC, maybe express AE and EC in terms of coordinates. 

Alternatively, since O is the origin, and D is midpoint of AB, let me try to find coordinates of E. 

Let me consider coordinates again. Let me choose specific coordinates for simplicity. Let me assign coordinates such that O is (0,0), B is (1,0), C is (0,1) as before. Then point A is another point on the unit circle. Let me pick coordinates for A. But since ABC is a triangle, A cannot coincide with B or C. Let me choose coordinates for A such that computations are manageable. 

For example, let me assume A is (cosθ, sinθ). Then AB connects (cosθ, sinθ) to (1,0). The midpoint D of AB would be [(cosθ + 1)/2, (sinθ + 0)/2]. Then line OD connects O(0,0) to D. So parametric equation of OD is t*[(cosθ + 1)/2, sinθ/2], where t ranges over real numbers. 

Now, E is the intersection of OD with AC. Let me find coordinates of E. 

First, find parametric equations for AC. Points A(cosθ, sinθ) and C(0,1). The parametric equation for AC can be written as A + s*(C - A) = (cosθ - s cosθ, sinθ + s(1 - sinθ)). Wait, more accurately: 

Parametric equations for AC: Starting at A and moving towards C. So direction vector is C - A = (-cosθ, 1 - sinθ). So any point on AC can be written as (cosθ - s cosθ, sinθ + s(1 - sinθ)), where s ∈ [0,1].

Alternatively, parameterizing with parameter k: 

E lies on AC, so E = A + k*(C - A) = (cosθ + k*(-cosθ), sinθ + k*(1 - sinθ)).

Also, E lies on OD. So E must satisfy the parametric equation of OD. Let me denote OD as t*D, where D is [(cosθ + 1)/2, sinθ/2]. So E can also be represented as t*[ (cosθ + 1)/2 , sinθ/2 ].

So equate these two expressions for E:

cosθ - k cosθ = t*(cosθ + 1)/2   ...(1)

sinθ + k(1 - sinθ) = t*sinθ / 2    ...(2)

We have two equations with variables k and t. Let me solve for k and t.

From equation (1):

cosθ (1 - k) = t*(cosθ + 1)/2 → t = [2 cosθ (1 - k)] / (cosθ + 1)

From equation (2):

sinθ + k(1 - sinθ) = t sinθ / 2 → substitute t from above:

sinθ + k(1 - sinθ) = [2 cosθ (1 - k) / (cosθ + 1)] * sinθ / 2 

Simplify RHS: [cosθ (1 - k) sinθ ] / (cosθ + 1 )

So:

sinθ + k(1 - sinθ) = [cosθ sinθ (1 - k)] / (cosθ + 1 )

Multiply both sides by (cosθ + 1):

[sinθ + k(1 - sinθ)] (cosθ + 1) = cosθ sinθ (1 - k)

Expand left side:

sinθ (cosθ + 1) + k(1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) 

= sinθ cosθ + sinθ + k[ (1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) ]

Set equal to right side:

sinθ cosθ + sinθ + k[ (1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) ] = cosθ sinθ (1 - k)

Subtract sinθ cosθ from both sides:

sinθ + k[ (1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) ] = cosθ sinθ (1 - k) - sinθ cosθ 

Wait, right side becomes cosθ sinθ (1 -k) - sinθ cosθ = cosθ sinθ (1 -k -1) = -k cosθ sinθ 

So:

sinθ + k[ (1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) ] = -k cosθ sinθ 

Bring all terms to left:

sinθ + k[ (1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) + cosθ sinθ ] = 0 

Compute inside the brackets:

(1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) + cosθ sinθ 

Expand first term:

(1)(cosθ + 1) - sinθ (cosθ + 1) + cosθ sinθ 

= cosθ + 1 - sinθ cosθ - sinθ + cosθ sinθ 

Simplify:

cosθ + 1 - sinθ 

So overall equation:

sinθ + k (cosθ + 1 - sinθ) = 0 

Solve for k:

k (cosθ + 1 - sinθ) = - sinθ 

→ k = [ - sinθ ] / [ cosθ + 1 - sinθ ]

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me check my algebra again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in expanding. Let me re-express:

Original expression after subtracting sinθ cosθ:

Left side was sinθ + ... equals to -k cosθ sinθ ?

Wait, earlier steps may have errors. Let me go back. 

After expanding the left side:

sinθ + k[ (1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) ] = -k cosθ sinθ 

So bringing all terms to left:

sinθ + k[ (1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) ] + k cosθ sinθ = 0 

Factor out k:

sinθ + k [ (1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) + cosθ sinθ ] = 0 

Let me compute the bracketed term again:

(1 - sinθ)(cosθ + 1) + cosθ sinθ 

= (1)(cosθ + 1) - sinθ (cosθ + 1) + cosθ sinθ 

= cosθ + 1 - sinθ cosθ - sinθ + cosθ sinθ 

Ah, the -sinθ cosθ and + cosθ sinθ cancel out. So remaining terms: cosθ + 1 - sinθ 

Yes. So the entire equation becomes:

sinθ + k (cosθ + 1 - sinθ ) = 0 

Hence:

k = - sinθ / (cosθ + 1 - sinθ )

Now, once we have k, we can find E's coordinates. Let me note that E lies on AC, so AE = k * |AC| ? Wait, no. Because in the parametrization, when k=0, E=A; when k=1, E=C. So AE corresponds to the distance from A to E, which would be k times the length of AC? Not exactly, unless the parameter k is normalized. However, since AC is a straight line, and E is a point along AC, the ratio of AE to EC depends on k. But since we're dealing with squares, maybe we can find AE² + CE² without knowing exact coordinates.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me recall that AE² + CE² can be thought of as the square of the sum minus twice the product, but not sure. Alternatively, since E lies on AC, AE + EC = AC. But AE² + CE² = (AE + CE)^2 - 2 AE * CE = AC² - 2 AE * CE. But I don't know if that helps.

Alternatively, since O is the origin, and E lies on OD, which is the line from O to D (midpoint of AB). Perhaps using vectors or coordinate expressions.

But maybe there's a geometric insight here. Since ABC is inscribed in a circle of radius 1, and O is the center. We need to find AE² + CE². 

Another idea: Since O is the origin, and E lies on OD, which is the line from O to D (the midpoint of AB). So E is some point along that line. Let me consider coordinates again. Let me try choosing specific coordinates for A to simplify calculations. For instance, let me choose θ such that calculations become easier. Let me set A at (0,-1). Wait, but then AB would connect (0,-1) to (1,0). Midpoint D would be ((0+1)/2, (-1+0)/2) = (0.5, -0.5). Then line OD is from (0,0) to (0.5, -0.5), which is the line y = -x. Then line AC connects A(0,-1) to C(0,1). This line is vertical line x=0. Intersection E of OD (y=-x) and AC (x=0) is at (0,0). But that would make E=O. But then AE is the distance from A(0,-1) to O(0,0): 1. CE is distance from C(0,1) to O(0,0): 1. Then AE² + CE² = 1 + 1 = 2. Which would be answer B. But is this valid? Wait, but in this case, ABC would have points A(0,-1), B(1,0), C(0,1). Is this triangle inscribed in the circle with center O(0,0)? Yes, since all points are at distance 1 from O. 

But then, what about the other conditions? For example, OC is perpendicular to OB. Here, OC is from O(0,0) to C(0,1), which is vertical line. OB is from O(0,0) to B(1,0), horizontal line. They are perpendicular. So that satisfies the given condition. Also, OD is the line from O to D(0.5,-0.5), which is perpendicular to AB. Let me check: AB connects (0,-1) to (1,0). Slope of AB is (0 - (-1))/(1 - 0) = 1. So line AB has slope 1, so OD has slope -1, which is indeed perpendicular. So that works. 

In this case, E is the intersection of OD (y=-x) and AC (x=0), which is (0,0). Thus, AE is AO, which is 1. CE is CO, which is 1. So AE² + CE² = 1 + 1 = 2. So answer is B. 

But wait, the problem says that OD intersects AC at E. In this case, E is O. But in the problem statement, E is defined via IntersectAt(Line(O,D),Line(A,C),Line(A,C),Point(E)), implying that E is the intersection point. But in this case, E is O. But O is the center. However, in this configuration, E coincides with O. But then, in this case, AE² + CE² = 2. So answer is B. 

But is this generalizable? Does this hold for any position of A? Or did I just get lucky with this particular choice of A?

Let me test another position for A. Let me take A at (1,0), but that would make AB collapse with B. So invalid. How about A at (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2)? Then, A is (approx 0.707, 0.707). Then, AB connects (0.707, 0.707) to B(1,0). Midpoint D is [(0.707 + 1)/2, (0.707 + 0)/2] ≈ (0.8535, 0.3535). Line OD is from (0,0) to (0.8535, 0.3535). Equation of OD: y = (0.3535 / 0.8535)x ≈ (0.414)x. 

Line AC connects A(0.707, 0.707) to C(0,1). Let me find the intersection E between OD and AC. Let me parametrize AC. Parametric equations for AC: starting at A, direction vector is (-0.707, 0.2929). So parametric equations: x = 0.707 - 0.707*t, y = 0.707 + 0.2929*t. 

Find t such that y = 0.414*x. Substituting:

0.707 + 0.2929*t = 0.414*(0.707 - 0.707*t)

Calculate RHS: 0.414*0.707 - 0.414*0.707*t ≈ 0.2929 - 0.2929*t 

So:

0.707 + 0.2929*t = 0.2929 - 0.2929*t 

Bring terms together:

0.707 = 0.2929 - 0.2929*t - 0.2929*t 

→ 0.707 = 0.2929 - 0.5858*t 

→ 0.707 - 0.2929 = -0.5858*t 

→ 0.4141 ≈ -0.5858*t → t ≈ -0.4141 / 0.5858 ≈ -0.707 

Thus, t ≈ -0.707. Plugging back into x and y:

x ≈ 0.707 - 0.707*(-0.707) ≈ 0.707 + 0.5 = 1.207 

Wait, but that would put E outside segment AC. Wait, but in our previous example, E was at O. What's happening here? 

Wait, perhaps in this case, the intersection E is beyond point C? Or maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check again. 

Wait, when t = -0.707, which is less than zero, so the point is extending beyond A in the opposite direction. But since OD starts at O and goes towards D, which is the midpoint of AB, which is in the positive direction. So maybe in this case, the line OD extended backwards passes through E. But in this case, E is not between A and C. However, the problem states that E is the intersection of OD and AC. Depending on where A is, E could be on AC or its extension. But in the problem statement, it's implied that E is on AC, so maybe there's a constraint that ensures E is on segment AC. 

But in this case, with A at (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2), the intersection point E is outside of AC. Which contradicts the assumption. So maybe my initial choice of A was special. Let me think why in the first case, E was at O. Because when A was (0,-1), AC was vertical line x=0, and OD was y=-x. Their intersection was (0,0). But in other cases, like when A is different, E might not be on AC. So perhaps there's a specific position of A that satisfies all the given conditions. 

Wait, but the problem says that triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle O, with OC ⊥ OB, and OD ⊥ AB intersecting AC at E. So perhaps there are constraints on the position of A. 

Wait, but in our first case, where A was (0,-1), the triangle ABC had vertices at (0,-1), (1,0), (0,1). Let me check if this triangle meets all the given conditions. 

Check if ABC is inscribed in circle O: All points are at distance 1 from O, so yes. 

OC is perpendicular to OB: OC is vertical, OB is horizontal, so yes. 

OD is perpendicular to AB: As checked earlier, yes. 

Intersection of OD and AC is E, which is O in this case. So AE is AO, which is 1, CE is CO, which is 1. Thus, AE² + CE² = 2. 

But in this case, E is O. However, the problem mentions point E as the intersection, so maybe E is allowed to be O. 

But in other configurations, like when A is chosen differently, would AE² + CE² still evaluate to 2? Let me try another example. Let me take A at (something else). 

Suppose A is at (1/√2, 1/√2). Then, coordinates:

A: (√2/2, √2/2), B: (1,0), C: (0,1). 

Midpoint D of AB: [(√2/2 + 1)/2, (√2/2 + 0)/2] = [(√2/2 + 1)/2, √2/4]

Line OD goes from O(0,0) to D. Let me parametrize OD as t * D. So any point on OD is t*( (√2/2 + 1)/2 , √2/4 ). 

Line AC connects A(√2/2, √2/2) to C(0,1). Parametric equations for AC: x = √2/2 - s*(√2/2), y = √2/2 + s*(1 - √2/2), where s ∈ [0,1]. 

To find E, solve for t and s such that:

t*( (√2/2 + 1)/2 ) = √2/2 - s*(√2/2) 

and 

t*( √2/4 ) = √2/2 + s*(1 - √2/2 )

This looks complex, but maybe plugging in specific values. Let me attempt solving numerically. 

Let me calculate numerical values:

√2 ≈ 1.414, so √2/2 ≈ 0.707. 

Coordinates of D: x-coordinate: (0.707 + 1)/2 ≈ 1.707/2 ≈ 0.8535, y-coordinate: 0.707 / 2 ≈ 0.3535. 

So line OD: parametric equations x = 0.8535 * t, y = 0.3535 * t. 

Line AC: from A(0.707, 0.707) to C(0,1). Let me parametrize with parameter k: x = 0.707*(1 - k), y = 0.707 + (1 - 0.707)*k. 

So for E to be on both lines:

0.707*(1 - k) = 0.8535 * t 

and 

0.707 + 0.293*k = 0.3535 * t 

Let me solve these equations. From first equation: t = [0.707*(1 - k)] / 0.8535 

Plug into second equation:

0.707 + 0.293k = 0.3535 * [0.707*(1 - k)/0.8535] 

Calculate RHS: 0.3535 / 0.8535 ≈ 0.414. Multiply by 0.707: ≈ 0.414 * 0.707 ≈ 0.293. So:

RHS ≈ 0.293*(1 - k)

Thus, equation becomes:

0.707 + 0.293k = 0.293 - 0.293k 

Bring terms together:

0.707 = 0.293 - 0.293k - 0.293k 

→ 0.707 = 0.293 - 0.586k 

→ 0.707 - 0.293 = -0.586k 

→ 0.414 = -0.586k → k ≈ -0.414 / 0.586 ≈ -0.706 

So k ≈ -0.706. Then, plug into x-coordinate:

x = 0.707*(1 - (-0.706)) = 0.707*(1.706) ≈ 1.207 

Which is greater than 0.707, so outside of AC segment. So E is outside AC. But according to the problem, E is the intersection of OD and AC. So either the problem allows E to be outside AC, or there's a constraint that ensures E is on AC. 

However, in the first example, E was on AC (at O), but in this case, it's not. So perhaps the specific position of A matters. But how do we ensure that E is on AC? 

Wait, perhaps there's a unique position for A that satisfies all the given conditions. Let me think. Given that OC is perpendicular to OB, and OD is perpendicular to AB, and ABC is inscribed in the circle. 

Wait, since OC is perpendicular to OB, angle COB is 90 degrees. So in the circle, the arc from B to C is 90 degrees. Therefore, BC is a chord subtending a right angle at the center. Hence, BC is length √2. 

But also, since OD is perpendicular to AB, and D is the midpoint of AB (as shown earlier), and E is the intersection of OD and AC. 

Maybe there's a relation between AE and EC. 

Alternatively, since O is the circumcenter, and ABC is a triangle with certain properties. 

Alternatively, since AE² + CE² = (AE)^2 + (CE)^2. But since E lies on AC, AE + EC = AC. So (AE)^2 + (EC)^2 = (AC)^2 - 2 AE * EC. But unless we know AE * EC, this might not help. 

Wait, but maybe using coordinate geometry with general A. Let me try to find AE² + CE² in terms of coordinates. 

Earlier, in the specific case where A was (0,-1), AE² + CE² = 1 + 1 = 2. But in another case, it's unclear. However, since the problem gives that the radius is 1, and asks for AE² + CE², and the answer choices are fixed, perhaps the answer is always 2 regardless of the position of A. 

But why? Maybe due to some invariant. 

Let me think of vector approaches. Let me consider O as origin. Vectors OA, OB, OC are all unit vectors. 

Let me denote vectors OA = **a**, OB = **b**, OC = **c**. Since OA, OB, OC are radii, ||**a**|| = ||**b**|| = ||**c**|| = 1. 

Given that OC is perpendicular to OB, so **c** • **b** = 0. 

OD is perpendicular to AB. Vector AB = **b** - **a**. Vector OD is along the line from O to D, which is the midpoint of AB. So vector OD = ( (**a** + **b**) ) / 2. Because midpoint of AB is (A + B)/2. Wait, since D is the midpoint of AB, vector OD is (A + B)/2. 

Wait, vector OD is from O to D, which is the midpoint of AB. So yes, vector OD = (OA + OB)/2. 

But OD is perpendicular to AB. Let me verify: vector OD • vector AB = 0. 

Vector AB = OB - OA = **b** - **a**

Vector OD = (OA + OB)/2 = (**a** + **b**)/2 

Dot product: [(**a** + **b**)/2] • (**b** - **a**) 

= [**a** • **b** - **a** • **a** + **b** • **b** - **b** • **a**]/2 

= [0 - ||**a**||² + ||**b**||² - 0]/2 

Since **a** • **b** = 0 (because OC ⊥ OB? Wait, no. Earlier, it was OC ⊥ OB, which translates to **c** • **b** = 0. But here, we're considering **a** • **b**? Wait, no. Wait, in this scenario, **a** is OA, **b** is OB, and **c** is OC. 

Earlier, we were told that OC ⊥ OB, i.e., **c** • **b** = 0. But what about **a** • **b**? It depends on the position of A. 

But the previous calculation shows that vector OD • AB = [ - ||**a**||² + ||**b**||² ] / 2. Since ||**a**|| = ||**b**|| = 1, this becomes [ -1 + 1 ] / 2 = 0. So this confirms that OD is perpendicular to AB. So this holds true regardless of A's position. 

So this condition is automatically satisfied. 

Now, E is the intersection of OD and AC. Let me express E as a scalar multiple along OD and along AC. 

Let me parameterize E as follows: since E lies on OD, it can be written as E = λ * OD = λ*(**a** + **b**)/2. 

Also, E lies on AC. So E can be expressed as a linear combination of A and C. Let me say E = μ*A + (1 - μ)*C = μ**a** + (1 - μ)**c**. 

So we have:

λ*(**a** + **b**)/2 = μ**a** + (1 - μ)**c** 

Rearranged:

λ/2 **a** + λ/2 **b** - μ**a** - (1 - μ)**c** = 0 

Grouping terms:

(λ/2 - μ)**a** + (λ/2)**b** - (1 - μ)**c** = 0 

Since **a**, **b**, and **c** are vectors from the origin, and assuming they are not colinear, this equation can only hold if coefficients are zero. However, since **a**, **b**, and **c** are not necessarily orthogonal or anything, this might not be straightforward. 

But perhaps we can use the fact that **b** • **c** = 0. Let me take dot product of both sides with **b**:

(λ/2 - μ)(**a** • **b**) + (λ/2)(**b** • **b**) - (1 - μ)(**c** • **b**) = 0 

We know that **b** • **c** = 0, and **b** • **b** = 1. 

Also, **a** • **b** is some value. Let me call it x. 

So:

(λ/2 - μ)x + λ/2 * 1 - (1 - μ)*0 = 0 

→ (λ/2 - μ)x + λ/2 = 0 

Similarly, take dot product with **c**:

(λ/2 - μ)(**a** • **c**) + (λ/2)(**b** • **c**) - (1 - μ)(**c** • **c**) = 0 

Again, **b** • **c** = 0, **c** • **c** = 1. 

So:

(λ/2 - μ)(**a** • **c**) + 0 - (1 - μ)*1 = 0 

→ (λ/2 - μ)(**a** • **c**) - (1 - μ) = 0 

This gives us two equations:

1. (λ/2 - μ)x + λ/2 = 0 

2. (λ/2 - μ)(**a** • **c**) - (1 - μ) = 0 

Where x = **a** • **b** 

Let me denote y = **a** • **c** 

And z = λ/2 - μ 

Then, equation 1 becomes: z * x + λ/2 = 0 → z*x = -λ/2 

Equation 2: z*y - (1 - μ) = 0 → z*y = 1 - μ 

But μ is related to z: z = λ/2 - μ → μ = λ/2 - z 

Substitute into equation 2:

z*y = 1 - (λ/2 - z) = 1 - λ/2 + z 

Rearrange:

z*y - z = 1 - λ/2 

→ z(y - 1) = 1 - λ/2 

From equation 1: z = -λ/(2x) 

Substitute into above:

[-λ/(2x)] (y - 1) = 1 - λ/2 

Multiply both sides by 2x:

-λ(y - 1) = 2x(1 - λ/2) 

Expand:

-λy + λ = 2x - xλ 

Bring all terms to left:

-λy + λ - 2x + xλ = 0 

→ λ(-y + 1 + x) - 2x = 0 

→ λ(1 + x - y) = 2x 

→ λ = 2x / (1 + x - y) 

Now, we need to express x and y in terms of known quantities. Recall x = **a** • **b**, y = **a** • **c**. 

But since **a**, **b**, and **c** are vectors from the origin, and **b** and **c** are perpendicular. Also, all have magnitude 1. 

Let me consider that in the first example, where A was (0,-1), then **a** = (0,-1), **b** = (1,0), **c** = (0,1). So x = **a** • **b** = 0*1 + (-1)*0 = 0. y = **a** • **c** = 0*0 + (-1)*1 = -1. 

Plugging into λ = 2x / (1 + x - y) = 2*0 / (1 + 0 - (-1)) = 0 / 2 = 0. So λ = 0. Then, E = λ*(**a** + **b**)/2 = 0, which means E is at O. 

Then AE is the distance from A to O, which is 1. CE is distance from C to O, which is 1. So AE² + CE² = 2. 

Now, let's try another example where A is arbitrary. Let me take A such that **a** is arbitrary. Let me choose **a** such that it forms a right angle with **b** and **c**. Wait, but **b** and **c** are already perpendicular. Let me choose **a** as a vector making some angle with **b** and **c**. 

Alternatively, since **a**, **b**, and **c** are all unit vectors, and **b** and **c** are perpendicular. Let me express **a** in terms of **b** and **c**. Let me say **a** = α**b** + β**c** + γ(**b** × **c**), but since we're in 2D, the cross product is not applicable. Wait, in 2D, we can represent **a** as a linear combination of **b** and **c**. Since **b** and **c** are perpendicular, they form an orthonormal basis. 

So **a** = p**b** + q**c**, where p and q are scalars. Since ||**a**|| = 1, then p² + q² = 1. 

So x = **a** • **b** = p. 

y = **a** • **c** = q. 

So, substituting into λ = 2p / (1 + p - q). 

Once we have λ, we can find E = λ*(**a** + **b**)/2. 

Now, AE is the distance from A to E. 

Vector AE = E - A = λ*(**a** + **b**)/2 - **a** = [λ/2(**a** + **b**) - **a**] = [ (λ/2 - 1)**a** + (λ/2)**b** ] 

The squared magnitude of AE is:

|AE|² = [ (λ/2 - 1)**a** + (λ/2)**b** ] • [ (λ/2 - 1)**a** + (λ/2)**b** ] 

= (λ/2 - 1)^2 ||**a**||² + (λ/2)^2 ||**b**||² + 2*(λ/2 - 1)*(λ/2)*(**a** • **b**) 

Since ||**a**|| = ||**b**|| = 1, and **a** • **b** = p. 

So:

|AE|² = (λ/2 - 1)^2 + (λ/2)^2 + 2*(λ/2 - 1)*(λ/2)*p 

Similarly, CE is the distance from C to E. Vector CE = E - C = λ*(**a** + **b**)/2 - **c** 

= [λ/2 **a** + λ/2 **b** - **c** ] 

Squared magnitude:

|CE|² = (λ/2)^2 ||**a**||² + (λ/2)^2 ||**b**||² + ||**c**||² + 2*(λ/2)(λ/2)(**a** • **b**) + 2*(λ/2)(-1)(**c** • **b**) + 2*(λ/2)(-1)(**c** • **a**) 

Wait, this might get too complicated. Instead of computing separately, maybe there's a simpler way. 

Alternatively, since AE² + CE² = |AE|² + |CE|². Let me add the two expressions:

|AE|² + |CE|² = [ (λ/2 - 1)^2 + (λ/2)^2 + 2*(λ/2 - 1)*(λ/2)p ] + [ (λ/2)^2 ||**a**||² + ... ] 

This seems too messy. Maybe there's a better approach. 

Wait, since E lies on AC, we can use the section formula. Let me think of E dividing AC in some ratio. Let me say AE : EC = m:n. Then, AE² + CE² = (m² + n²) * (AC²)/(m+n)^2. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, since O is the origin, and E is a point on OD and AC, maybe use coordinates. 

Let me return to the specific case where A is (0,-1), giving AE² + CE² = 2. Since the problem gives a unique answer, likely this is always 2. Hence, the answer is B. 

But to confirm, let me consider another case where A is at (0,1), but that would make C coincide with A, which isn't allowed. Or perhaps A at (1,0), but that would make AB collapse. 

Alternatively, consider a case where A is such that triangle ABC is a right triangle. For example, if A is at (0,1), B at (1,0), C at (0,-1), but then O is at (0,0). Wait, but then OC would be from (0,0) to (0,-1), and OB is from (0,0) to (1,0), which are perpendicular. Then AB is from (0,1) to (1,0), midpoint D is (0.5, 0.5). Line OD is from (0,0) to (0.5, 0.5), which is y=x. Line AC is from (0,1) to (0,-1), which is vertical line x=0. Intersection E of y=x and x=0 is (0,0). So AE is distance from (0,1) to (0,0) = 1, CE is distance from (0,-1) to (0,0) = 1. Again, AE² + CE² = 2. 

So in this case, same result. So it seems that regardless of the position of A, AE² + CE² is always 2. Hence, the answer is B.
