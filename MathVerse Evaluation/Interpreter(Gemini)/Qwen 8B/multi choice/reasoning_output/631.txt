MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the first maximum point of the function y = -5 sin x for x ≥ 0. The given information mentions that the sine function is graphed and passes through certain points like (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), etc., and it's symmetric about the origin. There's also a mention of a black vertex at (90,1).

First, I need to recall the standard sine function. Normally, y = sin x has its maximum at π/2 radians (which is 90 degrees) with a value of 1. The first maximum occurs at 90 degrees, then it goes back down to zero at 180 degrees, then reaches a minimum at 270 degrees (-1), and returns to zero at 360 degrees. But here, the function is transformed: y = -5 sin x. 

So, applying transformations to the sine function. Let me think. The negative sign reflects the graph over the x-axis. That means the maximum of the original sin x becomes a minimum for y = -sin x. Also, the amplitude is multiplied by 5, so instead of oscillating between -1 and 1, it oscillates between -5 and 5. 

But the question is about the first maximum point for x ≥ 0. Since the original maximum of sin x is at 90 degrees, but with the negative sign, the maximum would actually occur where the original minimum was. Wait, because reflecting over the x-axis flips the graph. So the maximum of -sin x would be at the same x-values where sin x is minimized. 

Wait, let me clarify. For y = -sin x, when does it attain its maximum? The maximum value of y is when sin x is at its minimum. Because multiplying by -1 turns minima into maxima. So the original minimum of sin x is at 270 degrees (3π/2 radians), which would become a maximum for y = -sin x. However, wait, maybe there's another consideration here. Let me check with specific points.

Original sin x has maximum at 90 degrees (value 1), minimum at 270 degrees (value -1). So for y = -sin x, plugging in 90 degrees gives y = -1, which is a minimum. Plugging in 270 degrees gives y = -(-1) = 1, which is a maximum. Therefore, the first maximum of y = -5 sin x would be at 270 degrees, but since we're dealing with x ≥ 0, and the period is 360 degrees, the first maximum would be at 270 degrees. But wait, let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the phase shift or other transformations. But in this case, the equation is y = -5 sin x, which is just a vertical reflection and scaling. So the key is to find where the maximum occurs. Since the original maximum of sin x is at 90 degrees, but with the negative sign, that point becomes a minimum. The next maximum would be where the original minimum was, which is at 270 degrees. So the first maximum point for y = -5 sin x is at x = 270 degrees, with y-coordinate 5. 

But wait, the original graph mentioned includes points up to (360,0). Let me check if there's a possibility of another maximum before 270 degrees. For example, could there be a maximum at some other point?

Wait, the function y = -5 sin x is equivalent to y = 5 sin(x + π), because sin(x + π) = -sin x. So shifting the graph of sin x to the left by π radians. But the first maximum of sin(x + π) would be when x + π = π/2 + 2πk, so x = π/2 - π + 2πk = -π/2 + 2πk. For k=1, x = -π/2 + 2π = 3π/2, which is 270 degrees. So yes, the first maximum occurs at 270 degrees. Hence, the coordinates would be (270, 5). 

But the problem says "the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x ≥ 0". So for y = -5 sin x, the first maximum is at x = 270 degrees. However, looking at the answer choices, they might have options like (270,5), but the user hasn't provided answer choices. Wait, the initial prompt said "answer choices" but the user input shows "No choices found." Maybe the answer is supposed to be (270,5), but since the answer choices aren't listed, the assistant needs to choose based on the given info. 

Wait, the original problem mentions that the sine function passes through (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), etc. But for the transformed function y = -5 sin x, the points would be scaled vertically. For example, at x=90 degrees, y = -5*1 = -5. At x=270 degrees, y = -5*(-1) = 5. So the first maximum is at (270,5). Thus, the coordinates would be (270,5). 

However, the problem states that the original graph is symmetric about the origin, which aligns with the sine function being odd. The transformation y = -5 sin x is still an odd function, maintaining symmetry about the origin. 

Therefore, the first maximum point is at (270,5). But since the answer choices are not given, but according to the instructions, the user wants the answer selected among options A-D. However, the initial message says "No choices found," which suggests that maybe the answer is not present. Wait, but the user included "Answer Choices: No choices found." Hmm, that seems confusing. Perhaps the actual answer is (270,5), but without knowing the options, how can I choose? 

Wait, maybe the answer expects the x-value in terms of π. Let me convert 270 degrees to radians. Since π radians is 180 degrees, 270 degrees is 3π/2 radians. But the problem uses degrees in the given points, like (90,1), which corresponds to π/2 radians. So maybe the answer is expected in degrees. 

Assuming that the answer choices are in degrees, the first maximum point is at (270,5). However, the user didn't provide answer choices. Given that, but the system requires selecting one of A-D, but the original answer choices were not given. This might be an error in the setup. But since the user says "No choices found," perhaps the intended answer is (270,5), which would correspond to option... Well, without knowing the options, I can't select. But given the original problem statement, the answer is (270,5). 

Wait, the user might have intended that the answer choices are A to D, but they weren't provided. In such cases, sometimes the answer is inferred. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the x-coordinate as 3π/2, but again, without knowing the options, I can't proceed. However, given that the initial points are given in degrees (like 90, 180, etc.), the answer is likely (270,5). 

Since the user instructed to pick one of A-D, but there are no choices, perhaps there's a mistake. But the assistant is supposed to choose based on the logic. Since the user's last instruction says "select the correct answer choice", even though there are none, but maybe the answer is (270,5), which would be represented as option C if, say, options are ordered. But without knowing the options, this is uncertain. 

Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the answer is (270,5), which is the first maximum point for y = -5 sin x. Therefore, the correct answer would be the option corresponding to (270,5). However, since the answer choices are missing, the system may require choosing based on the available data. But per the instructions, the assistant must select A-D. Assuming that the options are in order, and the answer is (270,5), which would be option C if options are A: (90, something), B: (180,...), C: (270,...), D: ... 

But since I don't know the actual options, I can't be precise. However, the problem states that the original function passes through (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), etc. So for y = -5 sin x, the maximum would be at x=270, y=5. Therefore, the coordinates are (270,5). If the answer choices include this, then that's the answer. But since the user says there are no choices, I'm forced to make an educated guess. 

In many standardized tests, the first maximum of y = -5 sin x would be at 270 degrees, so the answer is (270,5). Therefore, assuming that the answer choices have this as option C, the Final Answer would be C. But since I don't have the actual options, I'm making an assumption. However, given the structure of the problem, the correct answer is (270,5).
