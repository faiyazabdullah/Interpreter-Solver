MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. There's a circle with center G, since PointLiesOnCircle for all these points except D, which is mentioned as an external point. Points A, B, C, E, F are on the circle. Lines connecting D to B and D to C are secants of the circle. Also, there are arcs FE and AB with measures 118° and 108° respectively. Angles at G (angle EGB) is 52°, and angle EFB is 30°. We need to find the measure of arc CF.

First, let me recall some circle theorems that might be helpful here. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, the central angle is equal to the measure of its intercepted arc. Another thing is that the angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circumference relates to the arcs they intercept. Also, there's the property about angles formed by secants or tangents outside the circle.

Since D is an external point, and DB and DC are secants, maybe we can use the external angle theorem which states that the measure of an angle formed by two secants is half the difference of the measures of the intercepted arcs. But first, let's note down all the given arc measures and angles.

Given arc FE is 118°, so the arc from F to E is 118 degrees. Arc AB is 108°, so from A to B is 108 degrees. Then angle EGB is 52°, which is at the center G, so that should be equal to the measure of the arc it intercepts. Since G is the center, angle EGB intercepts arc EB. Therefore, the measure of arc EB is 52°, because the central angle equals the arc measure. Wait, but where is point B? Let me visualize the diagram.

Points A, B, C, E, F are on the circle. Let me try to sketch mentally. Let me think of the circle with center G. Points A, B, C, E, F lie on the circumference. Line DB and DC are secants, so D is outside the circle connected to B and C. Also, lines BE and FE are chords. Arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°, angle EGB is 52°, angle EFB is 30°, and we need to find arc CF.

Let me start by considering the angles given. Angle EGB is a central angle, so it corresponds to arc EB. Hence, arc EB is 52°. That gives us one arc measure. Now, angle EFB is an inscribed angle. Because F and B are points on the circle, and E is another point. So angle EFB intercepts arc EB. Wait, but inscribed angle over arc EB would be half the measure of arc EB. However, angle EFB is given as 30°, which would imply that arc EB is 60°, but earlier we thought arc EB was 52°. Hmm, contradiction here. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, angle EFB is formed by points E, F, B. So vertex at F, with segments FE and FB. So the inscribed angle at F intercepts arc from E to B. Therefore, according to the inscribed angle theorem, the measure of angle EFB is half the measure of arc EB. But angle EFB is 30°, so arc EB should be 60°. But previously, from the central angle EGB being 52°, arc EB is 52°. This inconsistency suggests I need to check my understanding.

Wait, maybe angle EGB isn't necessarily the central angle. Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnCircle(A,Circle(G)), etc., so G is the center. Therefore, angle EGB is indeed a central angle, hence arc EB should be 52°, but angle EFB is 30°, which would correspond to half of arc EB. So if angle EFB is 30°, then arc EB should be 60°, conflicting with the previous. Therefore, there must be something wrong here. Maybe angle EFB does not intercept arc EB?

Wait, let's think again. The inscribed angle at point F, angle EFB, intercepts arc from E to B that doesn't contain F. Wait, but depending on the position of F relative to E and B. If points E and B are on the circle, and F is also on the circle, then angle EFB intercepts arc EB that is opposite to F. But since F is on the circle, the arc EB could be major or minor. However, since the circle is 360°, and arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°, maybe there's more to the arrangement.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle EFB intercepts arc EB that's not directly opposite. Wait, but inscribed angle always intercepts the arc that's opposite the angle. So if angle EFB is formed by chords FE and FB, then it intercepts arc EB. But according to the central angle EGB, arc EB is 52°, so the inscribed angle should be half that, 26°, but the given is 30°. This discrepancy suggests there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps angle EGB is not the central angle? No, because G is the center. So if points E, G, B are colinear? Wait, no. Wait, angle EGB is at point G, so EG and BG are radii. Therefore, yes, angle EGB is a central angle, so arc EB is 52°. But angle EFB is 30°, which would mean that arc EB is 60°, which contradicts. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my assumption.

Wait, maybe angle EFB is not an inscribed angle? Wait, point F is on the circle, so EF and BF are chords. Therefore, angle at F is an inscribed angle. Unless there's some other configuration. Alternatively, maybe the arc intercepted is not EB but another arc. For example, if the angle is formed by two chords, then the intercepted arc is the arc that's not containing the angle. Wait, if angle EFB is at F, then the intercepted arc is EB. But if the arc EB is 52°, then angle EFB should be 26°, but it's given as 30°. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. Which means perhaps my initial conclusion that angle EGB corresponds to arc EB is incorrect?

Wait, angle EGB is at the center G, so it's definitely a central angle. Therefore, arc EB must be equal to angle EGB. Therefore, arc EB is 52°, which would make angle EFB equal to half of that, 26°, but it's given as 30°. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. How to resolve this?

Perhaps there's a misinterpretation of which arc is intercepted. Maybe angle EFB intercepts arc EB, but since the circle has multiple arcs between E and B, perhaps the major arc? Wait, if the arc EB is 52°, then the rest of the circle is 360 - 52 = 308°, which would make the major arc EB 308°, but that seems too large. Alternatively, maybe angle EFB intercepts the other arc EB, which would be the major arc, but then the measure would be half the difference of the arcs? Wait, no. Inscribed angles intercept the arc that's opposite the angle, regardless of major or minor. But if the arc is greater than 180°, the inscribed angle would still be half the measure of that arc. Wait, but angle EFB is 30°, so if it intercepts arc EB of 60°, but according to central angle it's 52°, which is conflicting.

This suggests that perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that angle EGB is the central angle for arc EB. Wait, unless points E, G, B are not in order. Wait, the problem says that G is the center, so EG and BG are radii. Therefore, angle EGB is formed by two radii, making it a central angle. Thus, arc EB is 52°, so angle EFB should be 26°, but given as 30°. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. This implies that either the problem has conflicting data, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps there's another way. Let me consider the possibility that angle EFB intercepts a different arc. Suppose that angle EFB intercepts arc EB that passes through another point, like A or C. But that depends on the position of F. Let me think again about the positions of the points.

We know arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°, and angle EGB is 52°, angle EFB is 30°. Let me try to reconstruct the circle step by step.

Starting with the circle centered at G. Points A, B, C, E, F are on the circle. Let me imagine placing them in order. Let me assume that moving around the circle, starting from A, going counterclockwise, we have B, then maybe C, then E, then F, and back to A? Not sure yet. Alternatively, arrange them such that arcs between certain points are known.

We know arc FE is 118°, so from F to E along the shorter arc is 118°, which would mean that the longer arc FE is 360 - 118 = 242°. Similarly, arc AB is 108°, so the longer arc AB is 360 - 108 = 252°. 

Now, angle EGB is a central angle measuring 52°, so arc EB is 52°, which would be the arc from E to B passing through the side opposite to G. Wait, but if G is the center, then arc EB is determined by the central angle. So arc EB is 52°, which would mean that the arc length from E to B is 52°, so the remaining arcs around the circle add up accordingly.

But then angle EFB is 30°, which should be half the measure of arc EB. But arc EB is 52°, so angle EFB would be 26°, not 30°. Therefore, this suggests that my assumption about which arc EB refers to is wrong. Maybe the arc EB that is intercepted by angle EFB is not the same as the one measured by the central angle. 

Wait, but angle EGB is at the center, so it must be the arc that's directly between E and B. So why is there a discrepancy? Maybe there's an error in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misapplying the theorems. Alternatively, perhaps angle EGB is not directly subtending arc EB. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says: Angle(E,G,B). So the angle is at point G, between points E and B. Therefore, that's the central angle between E and B, so it should correspond to arc EB. So arc EB is 52°. But then angle EFB, which is an inscribed angle, should be half of that arc, implying 26°, but the problem says it's 30°. This inconsistency needs resolution.

Maybe there's a typo in the problem? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the points' positions. Let me think differently. Perhaps the arc EB is not the one directly opposite but another arc? For instance, if the points are arranged such that arc EB goes through another point, making it larger. Wait, but the central angle would still be the smaller arc. Wait, but if the central angle is 52°, then the arc EB is 52°, regardless of direction. So if angle EFB intercepts the other arc EB, which is 360 - 52 = 308°, then the inscribed angle would be half of that, which is 154°, which doesn't match 30°. So that's not it.

Hmm. This is confusing. Let me try to look for another approach. Maybe the key lies in using the fact that D is an external point with secants DB and DC. The measure of angle EDB or something related could be found via the external angle formula. But I don't see immediate connections yet.

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship involving the arcs FE, AB, and others. Given arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°, and we need arc CF. Also, angle EGB is 52°, angle EFB is 30°. Let me try to find relations between these.

Another idea: since angle EFB is 30°, and it's an inscribed angle, it intercepts arc EB. Wait, but earlier calculation suggests that shouldn't be. Alternatively, maybe angle EFB intercepts arc EB plus some other arc? No, inscribed angle intercepts only the arc opposite the angle.

Wait, maybe the problem involves cyclic quadrilaterals or power of a point. Since D is outside the circle, and DB and DC are secants. Power of a point D with respect to circle G would state that DB * DA = DC * DG? Wait, no, power of a point formula for two secants is DB * DD' = DC * DC', where D' and C' are the second intersection points. Wait, but in our case, DB is a secant passing through B and another point. Wait, but the line DB connects D to B, and since B is on the circle, the other intersection point would be... Well, since D is outside, and line DB starts at D, goes through B, and extends beyond. But since B is on the circle, the entire line DB is a secant, so the power of point D is DB * DD_B, where D_B is the distance from D to B, but since B is the only intersection point? Wait, no. A secant from D intersects the circle at two points. But in this case, the line DB starts at D, goes through B, and since D is outside, the secant would pass through B and another point. Wait, but the problem mentions IsChordOf(Line(B,E),Circle(G)) and IsChordOf(Line(F,E),Circle(G)). So line BE is a chord, which connects B and E. Similarly, FE is a chord. 

Wait, maybe I should consider triangle EFB. In triangle EFB, angle at F is 30°, and maybe other angles can be related to arcs. Alternatively, looking at triangle EGB, which is a triangle with G as the center. Since EG and GB are radii, triangle EGB is isoceles with EG=GB. The base angles at E and B would be equal. Wait, angle at G is 52°, so the sum of angles at E and B would be 180 - 52 = 128°, so each base angle is 64°. So angles at E and B in triangle EGB are 64° each. 

Wait, but angle at E in triangle EGB is angle GEB, which is part of the inscribed angle. Let me think. If angle GEB is 64°, then that is an inscribed angle? Or is it part of the circle? Wait, point E is on the circle, and G is the center. So segment GE is a radius, and segment BE is a chord. So angle GEB is formed by radius GE and chord EB. This angle is not necessarily an inscribed angle. However, the measure of angle GEB can be calculated as follows: in triangle EGB, which is isoceles with sides GE=GB (radii), and angle at G is 52°, so the base angles are (180 - 52)/2 = 64°, as before. 

Therefore, angle GEB is 64°. Now, angle GEB is adjacent to angle EFB, which is 30°. Are these angles related? Let me consider line FE and point B. Since F and B are on the circle, and E is also on the circle. So line FE is a chord, and line EB is another chord. At point E, we have angles formed by chords FE and EB. The angle between FE and EB at point E is angle FEB. But how does this relate to other angles?

Alternatively, consider triangle EFB. We know angle at F is 30°, and maybe other angles can be found. For example, angle at E or B. But without knowing more, it's hard to say. However, if we can find other angles in this triangle, maybe we can relate them to arcs.

Alternatively, since angle EFB is 30°, and it's an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB, which we've been trying to reconcile with the central angle of 52°. If I accept that there's a conflict, perhaps the actual arc EB is 60°, which would make angle EFB 30°, and the central angle EGB would be 60°, contradicting the given 52°. But this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the initial assumption that angle EGB is a central angle is wrong? But the problem states that G is the center, so angle EGB must be central. Hence, this contradiction suggests that there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the arc referred to in the measure of angle EGB is not arc EB, but another arc. Wait, angle at G, between E and B. So the angle is between GE and GB, which are radii to points E and B. Therefore, it should be the central angle corresponding to arc EB. So arc EB is 52°, leading to angle EFB being 26°, but given as 30°. This is perplexing.

Perhaps the error is in assuming that the arc FE is 118°, but actually, it's the arc that doesn't pass through another point? Or maybe the arc FE is part of the circle that includes other points. Let me try to map the circle with known arcs.

Let me attempt to assign variables to unknown arcs. Let me denote:

Arc FE = 118° (given).

Arc AB = 108° (given).

Arc EB = 52° (from central angle EGB).

Then, total circle is 360°, so the sum of all arcs should be 360. Let me see if these arcs fit together.

Assuming the circle is divided into arcs AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, but I don't know the exact arrangement. Alternatively, the arcs between points may overlap or connect in various ways.

But with the points A, B, C, E, F on the circle, we need to figure out the order. Let's try to place them in order. Assume that the points are placed clockwise as A → B → C → ... → E → F → A. But this is arbitrary; the actual arrangement affects the arcs.

Alternatively, suppose that arc FE is 118°, so from F to E is 118°, arc AB is 108°, so from A to B is 108°. Also, arc EB is 52°, so from E to B is 52°. Let's try to fit these together.

Imagine starting at point E, going to B is 52°, then from B to A is 108°, so arc BA is 108°. From A to some point, then to F, then to E. But this is getting too vague.

Alternatively, let me consider that arc EB is 52°, arc AB is 108°, and arc FE is 118°. Let me try to compute other arcs.

Suppose we have points arranged as A, B, E, F, C, and back to A? Not sure. Let me try to consider that arc EB is 52°, arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°. Let me try to calculate the remaining arcs.

From E to B is 52°, from B to A is 108°, from A to somewhere, then to F, then to E. The total circle is 360°, so sum of all arcs should be 360. Let me assume that the arc from F to E is 118°, and arc from E to B is 52°, arc from B to A is 108°. What about the rest?

If I go from E to B (52°), B to A (108°), then from A to F, then from F to E (118°). Let me assume that from A to F is some arc x, and from F to E is 118°. Then total would be 52 + 108 + x + 118 = 278 + x = 360 ⇒ x = 82°. So arc AF is 82°. But what about the other arcs? Like from F to C, C to B, etc.? Wait, but I don't know where point C is located.

Alternatively, maybe there's another arc involved. Since point C is also on the circle, and lines DB and DC are secants. Maybe the arc from C to B or something else?

But without knowing the exact placement of point C, it's difficult. However, the question asks for arc CF. So perhaps we need to express arc CF in terms of other arcs.

Alternatively, consider that angle EFB is 30°, which we've been struggling with. If we assume that arc EB is 60°, then angle EFB would be 30°, which fits, and the central angle would be 60°, but the problem says it's 52°. This suggests that there's a miscalculation or misinterpretation.

Wait, maybe angle EGB is not the central angle for arc EB, but instead for a different arc. Wait, angle at G, between E and B. If the points are arranged such that the arc from E to B passing through C is 52°, while the arc passing through F is something else. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the central angle EGB is referring to the reflex angle, i.e., the larger arc. But typically, central angles are considered as the smaller arc unless specified otherwise. However, if angle EGB is the reflex angle, then its measure would be 360 - 52 = 308°, but that wouldn't make sense for an inscribed angle.

This is very confusing. Perhaps I should try to focus on the arcs we know and see if I can derive arc CF.

Given that arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°, and we need arc CF. Let me think about the total circle. If I can find other arcs, I might be able to find arc CF.

Also, since D is an external point with secants DB and DC, maybe applying the external angle theorem: the measure of angle at D is half the difference of the intercepted arcs.

For example, angle EDB or angle CDB. But I don't know which angle at D is relevant here.

Wait, the problem mentions Secant(Line(D,B),Circle(G)) and Secant(Line(D,C),Circle(G)). So line DB is a secant, meaning it intersects the circle at two points: B and another point. Since D is outside, the secant would pass through B and another point, say X. Similarly, line DC passes through C and another point Y. But the problem doesn't mention these other points, so maybe they are related to other points on the circle.

However, since line BE is a chord (IsChordOf(Line(B,E),Circle(G))), and line FE is a chord (IsChordOf(Line(F,E),Circle(G))). So points B and E are connected by a chord, and F and E are connected by a chord.

Maybe the key lies in using the fact that angle EFB is 30°, and angle EGB is 52°, to find relationships between arcs.

Let me try to consider triangle EFB. In this triangle, angle at F is 30°, and we might find other angles. Let me think about the other angles in the triangle.

If I can find the measure of arc EB, then I can relate it to the inscribed angle. But since there's a conflict between the central angle and the inscribed angle, perhaps there's a way to resolve it.

Wait, maybe the arc EB is not directly between E and B, but involves another point. For example, if the arc EB is actually the arc passing through C, making it longer. Let me try to imagine that. If arc EB passing through C is 52°, and arc EB passing through F is the major arc, then the inscribed angle at F would be half the measure of the arc that doesn't contain F. 

Wait, if angle EFB is formed by points E-F-B, then the intercepted arc is the arc EB that does not contain F. So if arc EB contains F, then the intercepted arc would be the other arc. Let me clarify: the inscribed angle at F intercepts the arc that is opposite to F, i.e., the arc that does not contain F. 

So if arc EB that does not contain F is 52°, then angle EFB would be half of that, which is 26°, but it's given as 30°. Alternatively, if the arc EB that contains F is 360 - 52 = 308°, then the inscribed angle would be half of that, 154°, which doesn't match 30°. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another arc involved. Let me think about the full circle. If arc FE is 118°, arc AB is 108°, and arc EB is 52°, then the remaining arcs would add up to 360 - (118 + 108 + 52) = 360 - 278 = 82°. This remaining arc could be arc from F to A or something else. But without knowing the exact positions, it's challenging.

Alternatively, since we need to find arc CF, let's consider that arc CF is part of the circle. If I can express arc CF in terms of other arcs.

Let me try to list all known arcs:

- Arc FE = 118°
- Arc AB = 108°
- Arc EB = 52° (from central angle)
- Need to find arc CF.

Let me assume that the points are arranged such that the order around the circle is F -> E -> B -> A -> C -> F, forming a closed loop. Let's check the sum of arcs:

From F to E: 118°
E to B: 52°
B to A: 108°
A to C: ?
C to F: ?

Total would be 118 + 52 + 108 + arc AC + arc CF = 360. So arc AC + arc CF = 360 - (118+52+108) = 360 - 278 = 82°. So arc AC + arc CF = 82°. But we need to find arc CF, so if we can find arc AC, we can get CF.

But how? Maybe through other relationships. Let's think about point C. Line DC is a secant, so it passes through C and another point. Also, line DC is a secant, so it intersects the circle at two points: D is outside, so the secant goes through C and another point, say X. But without knowing X, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, since line BE is a chord, and line FE is a chord, and point C is also on the circle, perhaps there's a relation between arcs involving C.

Wait, the problem also mentions line DC is a secant, and line DB is a secant. So from point D, two secants: DB and DC. Using the power of a point, we have that DB * DD_B = DC * DD_C, where DD_B and DD_C are the lengths from D to the second intersection points. But without knowing distances, this might not help directly.

Alternatively, maybe the angle at D is related to the arcs. For example, the angle between secants DB and DC at point D is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. But I don't know the measure of that angle.

Wait, but if I could find that angle, it might help. Let me think. The angle between secants DB and DC at D is equal to (arc BC - arc BAC)/2, where arc BC is the arc between B and C not containing D, and arc BAC is the arc passing through A. But without knowing those arcs, this might not help.

Alternatively, if I can find arc BC, then I could relate it to other arcs. But again, I need more information.

Let me return to the earlier issue with angle EFB. If I assume that arc EB is 60°, then angle EFB would be 30°, matching the given value. Even though the central angle EGB is supposed to be 52°, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Perhaps the central angle EGB is not for arc EB, but for a different arc? For example, if the central angle EGB is for arc EC or something else.

Wait, the central angle EGB is at point G, between points E and B. So it must be the arc between E and B. Unless there's a typo in the problem and the angle is at a different point. But the problem states Angle(E,G,B), which is at G, so it must be the central angle for arc EB.

This contradiction suggests that there might be an error in the problem setup, or perhaps I'm missing a key insight. Let me try to think differently.

Suppose that angle EGB is 52°, which is the central angle for arc EB, so arc EB is 52°. Then, angle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB, so it should be half of 52°, which is 26°. But the problem says it's 30°. This suggests that either the given values are inconsistent, or there's a different arc being intercepted.

Wait, what if angle EFB intercepts arc EB plus another arc? No, inscribed angles only intercept one arc. Alternatively, maybe it's an exterior angle, but it's formed by two secants, but in this case, it's formed by two chords.

Wait, maybe angle EFB is not an inscribed angle but an external angle. Wait, no, because F is on the circle. Let me recall: an inscribed angle is formed by two chords with the vertex on the circle. Yes, angle EFB is formed by chords FE and FB, with vertex at F on the circle, so it's an inscribed angle. Therefore, it should intercept arc EB. So why the discrepancy?

Unless the arc EB is not the one directly between E and B, but the arc that goes through another point, making it longer. For example, if arc EB passing through C is 52°, and the arc passing through F is the other arc. But then, the inscribed angle at F would intercept the arc that doesn't contain F, which would be the arc EB passing through C, which is 52°, giving angle EFB as 26°, still conflicting with 30°.

This is really perplexing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me try to use the given arcs and angles to build equations.

Let me denote the following arcs:

Let arc FE = 118° (given).

Let arc AB = 108° (given).

Let arc EB = 52° (from central angle).

Let arc CF = x° (what we need to find).

Other arcs: let's assume the circle is divided into arcs AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, but I don't know the exact arrangement. Alternatively, since points A, B, C, E, F are on the circle, there are several arcs between them.

Let me try to consider that arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°, and arc EB = 52°. Let me try to find other arcs.

If I can find arc BF, then maybe I can relate it to other parts.

But without knowing the exact positions, it's difficult. Let me try to assume a particular ordering of points on the circle. Let me assume the points are ordered as F, E, B, A, C, and back to F. Let's see:

From F to E: 118°

From E to B: 52°

From B to A: 108°

From A to C: y°

From C to F: x° (which is arc CF)

Total: 118 + 52 + 108 + y + x = 360 => y + x = 82°.

So arc CF is x, and arc AC is y, with x + y = 82°. But how to find x?

Maybe there's another relationship involving arc CF. Let me think about angle EFB = 30°. If I can relate this to other arcs.

In this assumed ordering, angle EFB is at point F, between E and B. The arc intercepted by angle EFB is arc EB, which is 52°, so angle EFB should be 26°, but it's given as 30°. So this doesn't work. Hence, my assumption about the arc EB is wrong.

Alternatively, if the arc intercepted by angle EFB is arc EB passing through C, which would be 52° + arc BC. Let me say arc BC is z°, then arc EB passing through C would be 52 + z. Then angle EFB would be half of that, so (52 + z)/2 = 30°, leading to 52 + z = 60 => z = 8°. So arc BC is 8°. Then, in the previous equation, x + y = 82°, and if arc BC is 8°, then arc from B to C is 8°, so y is arc AC, and arc CF is x. But how does this help?

If arc BC is 8°, then arc from B to C is 8°, and from C to F is x, and from F to E is 118°, from E to B is 52°, from B to A is 108°, and from A to C is y. Let me try to visualize this:

Starting from F, going to E (118°), then to B (52°), then to A (108°), then to C (y), then to F (x). Wait, but arc from A to C is y, and from C to F is x. Total arc from A to F is y + x = 82°. Also, arc from B to C is 8°, so from B to C is 8°, and from C to F is x. So the arc from B to F would be arc BC + arc CF = 8 + x. 

But how does this help? Maybe there's another relationship. For example, using the fact that D is an external point with secants DB and DC, and using the power of a point. The power of point D with respect to the circle is equal for both secants: DB * DD_B = DC * DD_C, where DD_B is the length from D to the second intersection of DB with the circle. But since DB is a secant passing through B and another point, let's call it X. Similarly, DC passes through C and another point Y.

But without knowing where X and Y are, it's hard to proceed. However, if we assume that X and Y are points on the circle, maybe related to other points.

Alternatively, since line BE is a chord, and line FE is a chord, maybe D is positioned such that line DB passes through B and another point, and line DC passes through C and another point. But without more info, it's hard to tell.

Let me try to think about the angle at D. The angle between secants DB and DC is equal to half the difference of the intercepted arcs. The formula is: measure of angle = ½ (measure of arc BC - measure of arc BAC), where BAC is the arc that doesn't contain D. But without knowing which arc is which, it's hard to apply.

Alternatively, if I can find arc BC, then I can relate it to other arcs. Earlier, I assumed arc BC is 8°, which came from assuming that angle EFB = 30° = ½ (arc EB passing through C). But this was under the assumption that arc EB passing through C is 52° + arc BC. If arc BC is 8°, then arc EB passing through C is 52 + 8 = 60°, leading to angle EFB = 30°, which matches the given value. This suggests that arc BC is 8°. 

So if arc BC is 8°, then from earlier, x + y = 82°, and arc BC is 8°. But what is y? It's arc AC. So if I can find arc AC, then I can find x = arc CF = 82 - y.

But how to find y? Let me think about other arcs. We have arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°, arc BC = 8°, arc EB = 52°, and arc CF = x, arc AC = y.

Let me try to find other arcs. Let's consider the arc from A to F. It is arc AC + arc CF = y + x = 82°. Also, arc from F to E is 118°, so the total circle is 360°. Let me verify:

arc FE (F to E): 118°

arc EB (E to B): 52°

arc BC (B to C): 8°

arc CA (C to A): y

arc AF (A to F): 82°

Wait, but arc AF is part of the circle, so adding all these: 118 + 52 + 8 + y + 82 = 118 + 52 is 170, plus 8 is 178, plus 82 is 260. But total should be 360, so missing 100°. Where is this missing arc?

Ah, because the arc from A to F is 82°, but also, there's arc from F to E, which is 118°, and arc from E to B, etc. Wait, perhaps I missed some arcs. Let me recheck.

Actually, the circle consists of all arcs between consecutive points. If the points are arranged as F, E, B, C, A, and back to F, then the arcs would be:

F to E: 118°

E to B: 52°

B to C: 8°

C to A: y

A to F: x

Wait, but then total would be 118 + 52 + 8 + y + x = 178 + y + x = 360. But we had earlier that x + y = 82, so substituting: 178 + 82 = 260, which is less than 360. This indicates a mistake in the assumption. 

Wait, this suggests that there's another arc missing. Maybe the arc from A to F is not just x, but also includes other arcs. This indicates that my assumption about the ordering of points is incorrect. 

Perhaps the points are arranged differently. Let me try another arrangement. Suppose the points are arranged as F, E, A, B, C, and back to F. Let's see:

arc FE: 118°

arc EA: ? 

arc AB: 108°

arc BC: ?

arc CF: x

But this is getting too speculative. Without knowing the exact order, it's challenging. 

But let's try to proceed with the earlier assumption that arc BC is 8°, even though it leads to inconsistencies in total arc measures. Maybe there's an error in the way I'm accounting for arcs.

If arc BC is 8°, and arc CF is x, and arc FE is 118°, arc EB is 52°, arc AB is 108°, and arc AC is y = 82 - x, then the total circle would be:

arc FE (118) + arc EB (52) + arc BC (8) + arc CA (y) + arc AF (x) = 118 + 52 + 8 + y + x = 178 + (y + x) = 178 + 82 = 260. Still missing 100°, so there must be another arc. Perhaps I missed arc from C to F? No, arc CF is x. Or perhaps there's an arc from A to F that includes other points?

This suggests that my current assumptions are flawed. Let me try to abandon the arc EB = 52° and instead focus on the angle EFB = 30°. If angle EFB is 30°, then the arc it intercepts is 60°. Let's say that arc EB is 60°, even though the central angle EGB is given as 52°. This would mean there's a contradiction, but perhaps the central angle is not for arc EB but for another arc.

Wait, if angle EGB is 52°, and it's a central angle, then it must correspond to arc EB. But if arc EB is 60°, then the central angle should be 60°, not 52°. This is a contradiction. 

Maybe the problem has a typo, and the angle EGB is 60°, not 52°? Or the arc FE is different? But assuming the problem is correct, I need to find another way.

Let me try to use the fact that angle EFB is 30°, and it's an inscribed angle intercepting arc EB, so arc EB = 60°. Then, the central angle EGB should be 60°, but the problem says it's 52°. This suggests that there's an error in the problem, or perhaps the angle EGB is not the central angle. But the problem states that G is the center, so it must be. 

At this point, I'm stuck with the inconsistency. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that arc EB is 60°, despite the given central angle, and see where it leads. Let's try that.

Assume arc EB = 60°, so central angle EGB is 60°, but the problem says it's 52°. This is conflicting, but let's proceed.

With arc EB = 60°, arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°. Let me try to find other arcs.

Total circle: 360°.

Sum of known arcs: 118 + 60 + 108 = 286°. Remaining: 360 - 286 = 74°. This remaining arc could be arc CF and others. But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say.

If I assume that arc CF is what we need to find, and the remaining arc is arc CF plus other arcs. But without more info, it's hard.

Alternatively, let's use the fact that angle EGB is 52°, and it's a central angle, so arc EB is 52°. Then, angle EFB is 30°, which is an inscribed angle, so it should intercept arc EB, which is 52°, giving 26°, but it's given as 30°. This suggests that the intercepted arc is not EB but another arc. Maybe it's arc EB plus some other arc?

Wait, if the inscribed angle at F intercepts arc EB, but there's another arc that is supplementary? No, inscribed angles only intercept one arc.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mix of arcs. For example, if the angle EFB is formed by two chords, and the intercepted arc is not just EB but includes other points. But I'm not sure.

At this point, I think the key is to use the given arcs and angles to set up equations, even if there's a conflict.

Let me try to write down all given arc measures and see if I can find relationships.

Given:

Arc FE = 118°

Arc AB = 108°

Central angle EGB = 52° ⇒ arc EB = 52°

Angle EFB = 30° ⇒ inscribed angle, so arc EB = 60°

Conflict here: arc EB cannot be both 52° and 60°. This suggests that the problem might have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the angle EFB is not an inscribed angle but an external angle? No, because F is on the circle. Or maybe it's an angle formed by two secants, but in this case, it's formed by two chords.

Wait, let me recall: the measure of an angle formed by two chords intersecting at a point on the circle is half the measure of the intercepted arc. So angle EFB is formed by chords FE and FB, with vertex at F on the circle. Hence, it's an inscribed angle, intercepting arc EB. So it should be half of arc EB. Therefore, arc EB = 60°, but central angle EGB is 52°, which would mean arc EB is 52°, leading to a contradiction.

This suggests that the problem is flawed, or there's a different interpretation. Since this is a hypothetical scenario, perhaps I should proceed with the assumption that there is a mistake in the problem, and arc EB is 60°, leading to angle EFB being 30°, and proceed from there.

Assuming arc EB = 60°, then the central angle EGB is 60°, but the problem says it's 52°. Let's ignore that for now and proceed.

Now, with arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°, arc EB = 60°. Let's try to find other arcs.

Total circle: 360°.

Sum of known arcs: 118 + 108 + 60 = 286°. Remaining: 360 - 286 = 74°. This remaining arc could be arc CF and other arcs. Assuming the points are arranged such that the remaining arc is arc CF and arc something else.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard. Let me try to assume that the remaining arc is arc CF. If arc CF is x, then x = 74°. But this is just a guess. However, the answer choices include 30, 44, 108, 118. 74 is not among them, so this is likely incorrect.

Alternatively, if the remaining arc is split into arc CF and arc something else. For example, if there's an arc from C to B, which is part of the remaining 74°. But without more info, this is guesswork.

Alternatively, let's consider the arc from B to C. Let's call it y. Then, arc from C to F is x. So, arc BC + arc CF = y + x = 74°. But how to find x?

Maybe using other relationships. For example, the angle at D. If D is an external point with secants DB and DC, then the measure of angle at D is half the difference of the intercepted arcs. Let's say the angle at D is θ, then θ = ½ (arc BC - arc BAC), where arc BAC is the arc from B to C passing through A. 

But without knowing θ, this is not helpful. However, if we can find θ, we can set up an equation. But how?

Alternatively, since line BE is a chord, and line FE is a chord, maybe there's a relationship between these lines and point D. But I'm not seeing it.

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should switch strategies and use the given answer choices to test which one fits.

The answer choices are A:30, B:44, C:108, D:118.

Let me assume that arc CF is 44° (choice B). Let me see if this fits with the given data.

If arc CF is 44°, then let's try to calculate other arcs.

Assuming arc FE = 118°, arc AB = 108°, arc CF = 44°, and arc EB = 52° (from central angle). Let's see if the total adds up.

But without knowing the exact arrangement, it's hard to say. Let me try to imagine the circle with these arcs.

If arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 52°, arc AB = 108°, and arc CF = 44°, then the remaining arc would be arc from C to F (already counted as 44°) and other arcs. This is too vague.

Alternatively, let me consider that the sum of arc FE (118) + arc EB (52) + arc BC (let's say z) + arc CA (w) + arc AF (x) = 360. But without knowing z, w, x, it's hard.

At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the given options and the relationships. Since arc FE is 118°, and arc AB is 108°, and angle EFB is 30°, which might suggest that arc CF is related to the difference between these arcs.

Alternatively, since angle EGB is 52°, and angle EFB is 30°, the difference between them is 22°, which might relate to arc CF. But this is too vague.

Another approach: the sum of arcs around the circle. If I consider the arc from C to F, and other arcs.

Let me think about the total circle. If I can express arc CF in terms of other arcs.

Let me recall that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the intercepted arc. If I can find an inscribed angle that intercepts arc CF, then I can find its measure.

For example, if there's an angle at B that intercepts arc CF, or at E, or at some other point.

But I don't have information about such angles. However, the given angle at G is 52°, and angle at F is 30°.

Wait, let me consider triangle EFB. We know angle at F is 30°, and if we can find other angles, maybe we can relate to arcs.

In triangle EFB, angle at F is 30°, angle at E and B are unknown. Let me denote angle at E as α and at B as β. So 30 + α + β = 180 ⇒ α + β = 150°.

These angles are related to the arcs. For example, angle at E (α) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc FB. Similarly, angle at B (β) is an inscribed angle intercepting arc FE.

Wait, let's see:

- Angle at E (α) in triangle EFB: this is formed by chords FE and BE. So it intercepts arc FB. Therefore, α = ½ arc FB.

- Angle at B (β) in triangle EFB: formed by chords FB and EB, so it intercepts arc FE. Therefore, β = ½ arc FE = ½ * 118° = 59°.

So β = 59°, and α = 150 - β = 150 - 59 = 91°.

Thus, α = 91° = ½ arc FB ⇒ arc FB = 182°.

Now, arc FB is 182°, which is a major arc. Let me verify if this makes sense.

Now, let's consider arc FB = 182°, and arc FE = 118°. So the arc from F to E is 118°, and from E to B is arc EB = 52°, as per the central angle. But arc FB is arc from F to B, which would be arc FE + arc EB = 118 + 52 = 170°, but we just calculated arc FB as 182°. This is a contradiction. 

Wait, this suggests that arc FB is 182°, but according to the arc FE + arc EB, it should be 118 + 52 = 170°. This discrepancy implies that arc FB is actually the major arc FB, which is 360 - 170 = 190°, but we calculated it as 182°. This is inconsistent.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-examine.

If angle at B (β) in triangle EFB is an inscribed angle intercepting arc FE, then β = ½ arc FE. But arc FE is 118°, so β = 59°, as before. Then, α = 150 - 59 = 91°, which would mean arc FB is 2*91 = 182°. But arc FB should be arc FE + arc EB = 118 + 52 = 170°, or the other way around. This inconsistency indicates a mistake in the assumption.

Wait, the arc intercepted by angle at B (β) is arc FE, but only if the angle is on the opposite side. If the angle at B is formed by chords BF and BE, then it intercepts arc FE. But if the arc FE is 118°, then β = 59°, as above. But this leads to arc FB being 182°, which would mean that the arc from F to B passing through the other side is 182°, while the direct arc is 170°. This is possible, but it suggests that the arc FB is 182°, which is a major arc.

Now, if arc FB is 182°, then the arc from F to B through the other side is 182°, and the direct arc is 170°. This means that the arc from B to F passing through the other side is 182°, which would imply that the arc from B to F is 182°, and the arc from F to B through the short way is 170°, which is not possible because the total circle is 360°. Wait, 182 + 170 = 352, which is less than 360, so there's a missing 8°, which might be due to other arcs.

But this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to use this information. If arc FB is 182°, and arc FE is 118°, then arc from E to B is arc EB = 182 - 118 = 64°, but this conflicts with the given central angle of 52°. 

This suggests that the arc EB is 64°, which would make the central angle EGB = 64°, but the problem says it's 52°. Again, contradiction.

But if I proceed, arc EB = 64°, then the central angle EGB is 64°, but the problem says it's 52°. This is still conflicting.

However, if I use this arc EB = 64°, then arc from E to B is 64°, and arc from B to F is 182°, which would mean that the arc from B to F passing through E is 64 + 118 = 182°, which matches. 

Now, let's try to find arc CF. Let me consider other arcs. We have arc FE = 118°, arc EB = 64°, arc AB = 108°. Let me try to find arc CF.

Assuming the points are arranged as F, E, B, A, C, and back to F. Let me calculate the arc from C to F.

From F to E: 118°

From E to B: 64°

From B to A: 108°

From A to C: let's say arc AC is x

From C to F: arc CF is y

Total: 118 + 64 + 108 + x + y = 290 + x + y = 360 ⇒ x + y = 70°.

But we need to find y = arc CF.

To find x, let's consider other relationships. For example, if there's an angle at G or elsewhere that relates to arc AC or CF.

Alternatively, since arc FB is 182°, and arc FE is 118°, then arc from F to B through E is 182°, so arc from B to F through E is 182°, which means the arc from B to F through the other side is 360 - 182 = 178°. But this might not help.

Alternatively, since arc AB is 108°, and arc EB is 64°, then arc from A to B is 108°, and from B to E is 64°, so from A to E is 108 + 64 = 172°. But this is the arc from A to E passing through B. The other arc from A to E would be 360 - 172 = 188°.

But I don't see how this helps.

Let me try to use the fact that arc FB is 182°, and arc AB is 108°. Let me see if there's a relationship between these.

If arc FB is 182°, and arc AB is 108°, then the arc from A to B is 108°, and from B to F is 182°, so the arc from A to F is 108 + 182 - arc AB? No, this is unclear.

Alternatively, the arc from A to F would be arc AB + arc BF - arc BB? Not sure.

At this point, I'm running out of ideas. Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the answer choices and the relationships.

Earlier, I found that if arc FB is 182°, and arc FE is 118°, then arc EB is 64°, which would make the central angle EGB = 64°, but it's given as 52°. This suggests that there's a factor of 64 - 52 = 12° difference. Maybe this is related to arc CF.

If arc CF is 44°, then 44 + 52 = 96, which doesn't seem related. Alternatively, if arc CF is 44°, and the difference is 12°, but this is too vague.

Looking at the answer choices, option B is 44. Let me assume that arc CF is 44°, and see if it fits.

If arc CF is 44°, and arc FE is 118°, then the arc from C to F is 44°, and from F to E is 118°, so the arc from C to E is 44 + 118 = 162°. If arc AB is 108°, and arc EB is 52°, then arc from A to B is 108°, and from B to E is 52°, so arc from A to E is 108 + 52 = 160°. This is close to 162°, but not quite. The difference is 2°, which might be due to rounding or miscalculations.

Alternatively, if arc CF is 44°, and the total circle is 360°, let me try to calculate the sum of known arcs:

arc FE = 118°

arc AB = 108°

arc EB = 52°

arc CF = 44°

Let me assume the remaining arc is arc from C to B, which would be 360 - (118 + 108 + 52 + 44) = 360 - 322 = 38°. So arc CB is 38°. 

Now, let's check if this makes sense with other information. For example, in triangle EFB, we had arc FB = 182°, which would be arc from F to B passing through C and A. Let's see: arc from F to C is 44°, from C to B is 38°, so total arc from F to B is 44 + 38 = 82°, but earlier calculation said it should be 182°. This is a contradiction.

This suggests that my assumption is incorrect. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of a clear path, I'll choose the answer that makes the most sense based on the given options and the relationships. Since angle EFB is 30°, which is half of 60°, and if arc CF is 44°, it might be related to other arcs. Alternatively, if arc CF is 44°, and arc FE is 118°, the difference is 74°, which might relate to other arcs.

But I'm not confident. Given the options, and the fact that 118° is already used, and 108° is given, the most plausible answer is B: 44°, as it's a common arc measure in such problems.
