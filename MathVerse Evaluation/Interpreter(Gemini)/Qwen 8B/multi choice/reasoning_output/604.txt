====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two cyclists, Oliver and Justin, whose progress is shown on a graph with time on the x-axis and distance on the y-axis. The question is asking how much faster Oliver is traveling compared to Justin. 

First, I need to recall that in such graphs, the slope of the line represents speed because speed is the rate of change of distance over time. So, if I can find the slopes of the two lines corresponding to each cyclist, I can compare them to see the difference in their speeds.

Looking at the given predicates, there are points named Oliver and Justin, and lines associated with each. Also, there are several PointLiesOnLine statements. Let me parse these. 

The predicates mention that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver) and Line(0,0). Similarly, Point(Justin) lies on Line(Justin) and Line(1,25). Wait, maybe those lines are equations of the form y = mx + b? Because they're referring to lines with coordinates like (0,0) and (1,25). Hmm, but the way it's written might mean different things. For example, Line(0,0) could be the line passing through the origin, and Line(1,25) would be a line that passes through the point (1,25)? Or perhaps these are parametric representations?

Wait, actually, in standard coordinate geometry, a line can be defined by two points. But here, the syntax seems to indicate that Line(0,0) refers to a line with some parameters. Maybe these are lines in the form of y = mx + c? For instance, Line(0,0) might represent the line where when x=0, y=0, so that's the line y = mx. Then Line(1,25) would be a line where when x=1, y=25. But without more info, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, maybe these lines are defined by their slope and intercept. 

But since the problem mentions that the x-axis is Time and the y-axis is Distance, the lines representing their progress should be straight lines starting from the origin (assuming they start at time 0, distance 0). However, the given PointLiesOnLine statements say that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver) and Line(0,0). Wait, that might mean that Oliver's position is on his own line and also on the line (0,0). But that doesn't make much sense unless Line(0,0) is the same as Line(Oliver). Wait, maybe the lines are parametrized differently. 

Alternatively, perhaps Line(0,0) is the line that goes through the points (0,0) and another point. But without knowing the other points, it's tricky. However, the key thing is that the problem involves two linear functions (lines) representing their progress. Each line has a slope, which is their speed. 

Let me think again. Since the x-axis is Time and the y-axis is Distance, each cyclist's progress is represented by a straight line. The slope of each line is their speed. To find how much faster Oliver is than Justin, I need to compute the difference in their slopes. 

So, I need to find the equations of the two lines. For that, I need two points on each line. 

Given that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver) and Line(0,0). Wait, maybe Line(0,0) refers to the line that passes through the origin (0,0). Similarly, Line(1,25) would pass through (1,25). But how do these lines relate to the points? 

Wait, the PointLiesOnLine predicates state:

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(Oliver)) – so Oliver's point is on his own line.

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Justin), Line(Justin)) – same for Justin.

Additionally:

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(0,0)) – Oliver's point is on the line called Line(0,0).

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Justin), Line(1,25)) – Justin's point is on Line(1,25).

Also:

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(5,175)) – Oliver's point is on Line(5,175).

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Justin), Line(5,125)) – Justin's point is on Line(5,125).

Hmm, this suggests that there are multiple lines involved. But how do these lines correspond to the two cyclists' paths? 

Perhaps Line(0,0) and Line(5,175) refer to the lines that Oliver's point lies on. Wait, but each line is defined by two points. For example, Line(0,0) could be a line that passes through the points (0,0) and another point. But how do we know which points?

Alternatively, maybe the lines are defined by their slope and intercept. For instance, Line(a,b) could be a line with equation y = ax + b. So Line(0,0) would be y = 0x + 0 → y = 0, which is the x-axis. That doesn't make sense for a cyclist's progress, since distance can't be zero unless time is zero. But maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe Line(0,0) is a vertical line x=0, but that would be the y-axis. Still, that doesn't fit with the context.

Wait, but if Line(0,0) is the line that passes through (0,0), and Line(5,175) is a line that passes through (5,175), then perhaps these are the lines that Oliver's point lies on. But since each person has their own line, maybe the lines for Oliver and Justin are determined by the points they lie on. 

For example, Oliver's line (Line(Oliver)) includes his point and also lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Wait, that might imply that Oliver's line is the intersection of Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). But that would require that both lines intersect at a point, which would be Oliver's point. Similarly for Justin's line. 

So, if Line(0,0) and Line(5,175) intersect at Oliver's point, then Oliver's line is that intersection. Similarly, Line(1,25) and Line(5,125) intersect at Justin's point. Therefore, the lines for Oliver and Justin are determined by these pairs of lines. 

Therefore, we can find the equations of these lines to find their slopes. 

Let me try to work this out. 

First, for Oliver's line: It lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Assuming that Line(0,0) is the line passing through (0,0), and Line(5,175) is the line passing through (5,175). Wait, but if Line(0,0) is just the line through (0,0), then it's infinitely many lines. Unless Line(0,0) is specifically the line y = mx, where m is some slope. But without knowing the slope, how can we proceed?

Alternatively, perhaps Line(a,b) refers to the line connecting the points (a,b) and (some other point). Wait, but the problem says "the graph with 2 linear functions", so there are two lines: one for Oliver and one for Justin. Each line has a certain slope. 

But the given PointLiesOnLine statements suggest that each point (Oliver and Justin) lies on two lines. For example, Oliver's point lies on Line(Oliver) and Line(0,0). So, Line(Oliver) and Line(0,0) intersect at Oliver's point. Similarly for Justin. 

This implies that Line(Oliver) is the line that contains the point (where Oliver is) and also intersects with Line(0,0). But without knowing the coordinates of Oliver's point, this is challenging. 

Wait, but the problem states that the x-axis is Time and the y-axis is Distance. So, each point (like Point(Oliver)) represents a specific time and distance. For example, if Oliver's point is at (t, d), then that means at time t, he has traveled distance d. 

However, the problem does not directly give us the coordinates of the points, but gives that each point lies on certain lines. 

Wait, but perhaps the lines mentioned in the predicates are the lines representing the cyclists' paths. For instance, Line(Oliver) is Oliver's path, which is a straight line. Similarly, Line(Justin) is Justin's path. Additionally, there are other lines mentioned: Line(0,0), Line(1,25), Line(5,175), Line(5,125). These might be other lines in the graph. 

But how do these lines relate to the cyclists' paths? For example, Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver) and Line(0,0). So, Oliver's point is the intersection of his own line and Line(0,0). Similarly for Justin. 

Assuming that Line(0,0) is the line that passes through the origin (time 0, distance 0), which would be the line representing someone who starts at time 0, distance 0. So, if Oliver's point lies on Line(0,0), that means that at some time t, his distance is d, and this point (t,d) is on Line(0,0), which is the line y = mx, assuming it's a straight line starting from the origin. Wait, but if Line(0,0) is the line through (0,0), then it's a straight line with some slope. But if Oliver's point is on both Line(Oliver) and Line(0,0), then Oliver's line (his path) must intersect Line(0,0) at his point. 

But this is getting complicated. Maybe we need to consider that Line(0,0) is the line that starts at (0,0), which is the origin. So, for example, if Oliver's line passes through (0,0) and another point (say, (5,175)), then his line is determined by those two points. Similarly, Justin's line passes through (1,25) and (5,125). 

Wait, looking back at the predicates: Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver) and Line(0,0). Also, Point(Oliver) lies on Line(5,175). Wait, this suggests that Oliver's point is on three lines: his own line, Line(0,0), and Line(5,175). Which would mean that Line(0,0) and Line(5,175) intersect at Oliver's point. Similarly for Justin. 

So, if Line(0,0) is the line through (0,0), and Line(5,175) is the line through (5,175), then their intersection is Oliver's point. Similarly, Line(1,25) and Line(5,125) intersect at Justin's point. 

Thus, Oliver's line is the line that passes through (0,0) and (5,175), making his path a straight line from the origin to (5,175). Similarly, Justin's line is the line passing through (1,25) and (5,125). 

Wait, but why would Line(0,0) and Line(5,175) be considered as lines? If Line(0,0) is a line that goes through (0,0), and Line(5,175) is a line that goes through (5,175), then their intersection point is Oliver's position. But if Oliver's line is the line connecting (0,0) and (5,175), then that would be his path. Similarly for Justin. 

So, the slope of Oliver's line would be (175-0)/(5-0) = 175/5 = 35 units per unit time. 

For Justin, his line connects (1,25) and (5,125). The slope would be (125-25)/(5-1) = 100/4 = 25 units per unit time. 

Then, the difference in speed is 35 - 25 = 10 units per unit time. Therefore, Oliver is traveling 10 units faster than Justin. 

But wait, the answer choices aren't listed here, but according to the initial instructions, the user hasn't provided options. However, the original question says "Answer Choices: No choices found." So, the user probably expects me to calculate the numerical answer. But since the assistant needs to choose among A-D, but in the problem statement, the answer choices are missing. However, based on the calculation, the difference is 10. 

Wait, but the problem might have different numbers. Let me check again. 

Oliver's line: From (0,0) to (5,175). Slope is 175/5 = 35. 

Justin's line: From (1,25) to (5,125). Slope is (125-25)/(5-1) = 100/4 = 25. 

Difference is 35 - 25 = 10. So, Oliver is traveling 10 units faster. 

But since the answer choices weren't provided, and the user said "No choices found," but the original instruction requires selecting from A-D. However, since the actual answer isn't among the options, but the user's system may expect a specific letter. But in the absence of options, I'm supposed to provide the numerical answer. However, the user instructed to select from A-D. This is confusing. 

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: 

"ANSWER CHOICES:
No choices found."

So, the user didn't provide answer choices, hence the "No choices found." But the original problem likely had options, but they were omitted. However, based on the calculation, the answer is 10. Since the user wants the answer in the format Final Answer: A, B, C, D, but there are no options, perhaps there was a mistake. However, the user might have intended that the answer is 10, and in the original problem, the options included 10 as one of them. But since the user hasn't provided options, I'll assume that the answer is 10, and thus, depending on how the options were labeled, but since there's no way to know, I'll proceed with the calculation. 

But the problem says to select the correct answer choice. Since the options are missing, perhaps the user made an error. However, given the data, the answer is 10. So, if the options were A: 10, then Final Answer: A. But without knowing the options, this is speculative. However, given that the problem is about finding the difference in speed, which is 10, and if the answer choices are A: 10, then that's the answer. 

Since the user's final instruction says to end with exactly one of the four letters, I'll go with the calculated answer being 10, which would correspond to option A if that's the first choice. Hence, Final Answer: A.
