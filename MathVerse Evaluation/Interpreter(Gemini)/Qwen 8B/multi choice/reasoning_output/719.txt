MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem is about two similar spheres, A and B. The smaller one has a radius of 3 cm, and the larger one has a radius of 12 cm. We need to find the ratio of the volume of Sphere A to Sphere B.

First, I remember that when dealing with similar figures, the ratio of their volumes is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. Since they're spheres, their radii are the key linear measure here. 

So, the ratio of the radii would be 3 cm to 12 cm, which simplifies to 1:4. But since volume scales with the cube of the radius, the volume ratio should be (1/4)^3 = 1/64. Wait, but wait—the question asks for the ratio of Sphere A to Sphere B. So if A is the smaller one, then it's 1/64. Let me double-check that.

Alternatively, maybe I should write it as Volume A / Volume B. Since Volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. So if r_A = 3 and r_B = 12, then Volume A is (4/3)π*(3)^3 and Volume B is (4/3)π*(12)^3. Dividing them cancels out the (4/3)π, leaving (3^3)/(12^3) = 27/1728 = 1/64. Yep, that seems right. So the ratio is 1:64, so the answer should be 1/64. But wait, looking back at the problem statement, the user mentioned that the answer choices aren't listed, but according to the initial setup, there were answer choices. However, the user says "No choices found," but maybe that's just part of the setup. Anyway, the calculation leads to 1/64. But the problem mentions "the ratio of the volume of Sphere A to Sphere B"—so A:B is 1:64, so the answer is 1/64. Therefore, if the options included this, that would be the choice. Since the original problem didn't list options, but the user said "No choices found," perhaps the intended answer is 1/64, which would correspond to option A if the choices were labeled accordingly. But without seeing the actual choices, I have to assume that the answer is 1/64, so the Final Answer would be A if that's the first option. Alternatively, maybe the answer is presented differently. Wait, but the problem states that the spheres are similar, which confirms that the scaling factor applies. So yes, the ratio is 1/64.
