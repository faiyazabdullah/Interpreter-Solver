MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So we have triangle ABC with point D being the intersection of the angle bisectors BD and CD. Wait, but hold on, if BD and CD are angle bisectors, then D should be the incenter of the triangle, right? Because the incenter is where all angle bisectors meet. But wait, the problem says D is the intersection of BD and CD, so maybe there's some confusion here. Let me check the given predicates again.

Looking back, the predicates say that Line(B,D) bisects Angle(A,B,C), which is angle B, I think. Wait, no—angle at vertex B? Wait, Angle(A,B,C) would be angle at B, since it's written as A-B-C. Similarly, Line(C,D) bisects Angle(A,C,B), which is angle at C. So BD is the bisector of angle B, and CD is the bisector of angle C. Therefore, D is the incenter of triangle ABC because it lies at the intersection of two angle bisectors. That makes sense.

Given that angle A is 50 degrees. The question asks for angle D, which I assume refers to angle ADC or angle BDC? Or maybe angle BDC? Wait, the problem statement mentions angle D. Hmm. Wait, in triangle ABC, points B and C are connected to D, so D is inside the triangle. The angles around D... Maybe they mean angle BDC? Or angle ADB? Wait, perhaps angle at D, like angle BDC?

Wait, the original problem says "angle D". But in geometry problems, when they refer to angle D without specifying, it could be ambiguous. However, given that D is inside the triangle formed by the angle bisectors, maybe angle BDC? Let me think. Since BD and CD are angle bisectors, then in triangle ABC, D is the incenter. Then, in that case, angle BDC would be something we can compute based on the angles of the triangle.

But first, let me recall that in a triangle, the incenter's angles can be calculated using the formula. For example, angle BDC equals 90 + half of angle A. Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. 

In general, for the incenter, the measure of angle BDC can be found by considering the sum of angles in triangle BDC. Let me think. At point D, which is the incenter, BD and CD are bisectors. So angle DBC is half of angle B, and angle DCB is half of angle C. Then, in triangle BDC, the sum of angles is 180 degrees. So angle BDC = 180 - (half angle B + half angle C). 

Since angle A is 50 degrees, the sum of angles B and C is 180 - 50 = 130 degrees. Therefore, half of angle B plus half of angle C is (B + C)/2 = 130/2 = 65 degrees. Therefore, angle BDC = 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. Wait, that would make angle BDC equal to 115 degrees. Looking at the answer choices, option C is 115°, so that might be the answer. 

Wait, but let me confirm my reasoning. Let me write down the steps properly.

First, in triangle ABC, angles at A, B, C are denoted as ∠A, ∠B, ∠C. Given ∠A = 50°, so ∠B + ∠C = 130°. 

Since D is the incenter, BD and CD are the bisectors of angles B and C respectively. Therefore, in triangle BDC, angles at B and C are each half of the original angles. So angle DBC = (∠B)/2 and angle DCB = (∠C)/2. 

Then, in triangle BDC, the third angle at D is ∠BDC = 180° - [(∠B)/2 + (∠C)/2] = 180° - ( (∠B + ∠C)/2 ) = 180° - (130° / 2) = 180° - 65° = 115°. 

Therefore, angle BDC is 115°, which corresponds to option C. So the answer should be C. 

Wait, but let me check if there's another way this could be interpreted. Could angle D refer to another angle? For example, maybe angle ADC or angle ADB? But the problem states that D is the intersection of BD and CD. So if we consider triangle ADC, but then again, unless specified otherwise, angle D likely refers to the angle at D between BD and CD, which is angle BDC. 

Alternatively, maybe angle ADB? Let me see. Suppose we look at angle ADB. But since D is the incenter, angle ADB would be different. Let me calculate that. 

In triangle ABD, angle at D. Wait, angle ABD is half of angle B, angle BAD is angle A, which is 50°, but wait no. Wait, in triangle ABD, angles at A, B, D. Wait, maybe it's better to use the formula for the angles at the incenter. 

Another formula: The measure of angle between two angle bisectors (like angle BDC) can also be expressed as 90 + (∠A)/2. Let me check that. 

If angle BDC = 90 + (∠A)/2, then substituting ∠A = 50°, gives 90 + 25 = 115°, which matches our previous calculation. Therefore, angle BDC = 115°, which is option C. 

So regardless of whether we compute directly via triangle BDC or use the formula involving angle A, we get 115°, which is option C. Hence, the answer should be C.
