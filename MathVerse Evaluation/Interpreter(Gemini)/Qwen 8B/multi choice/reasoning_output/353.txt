MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the airplane is currently flying 35 degrees south of east. Then it turns 7 degrees to the left. We need to find the new heading, how many degrees south of east it is.

First, I need to visualize this. South of east means the direction is measured from the east axis towards the south. So if you imagine a coordinate system where east is the positive x-axis and north is the positive y-axis, then south would be negative y. But directions like south of east are typically measured clockwise from east? Wait, maybe I should think about standard position angles. In math, angles are usually measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (east). But here, the problem says "south of east," which might mean that the angle is measured clockwise from east towards south. For example, 35 degrees south of east would be pointing 35 degrees downward from east, so in the fourth quadrant if we consider standard position.

Now, the plane is turning 7 degrees to the left. Left from its current direction. Since it was going south of east, turning left would mean changing the angle. Let me think about how the angle changes. If the original direction is 35 degrees south of east, that's equivalent to an angle of 90 + 35 = 125 degrees in standard position? Wait, no. Let me clarify. If you're facing east and turn 35 degrees toward south, that would be 35 degrees below the east axis. In terms of standard position (counterclockwise from positive x-axis), that would be 360 - 35 = 325 degrees? Or wait, maybe not. Because south is 180 degrees from east. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the coordinate systems.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to model this with vectors or coordinate axes. Suppose the initial direction is 35 degrees south of east. That means the angle between the east direction and the plane's path is 35 degrees, measured towards the south. So if you imagine standing at the origin, facing east, then turning 35 degrees towards south (which would be a clockwise turn). So in terms of standard position (mathematical angle), starting from the positive x-axis (east), rotating clockwise by 35 degrees would place the direction in the fourth quadrant. However, in mathematics, angles are typically measured counterclockwise, so a clockwise rotation would correspond to a negative angle. So the standard position angle would be -35 degrees, or equivalently 360 - 35 = 325 degrees.

But when the plane turns left, which way does that go? If the plane is moving along a direction that's 35 degrees south of east (so, say, heading southeast but more towards south), turning left would mean turning towards the west. Wait, depends on the orientation. Let me think again. If the plane is flying south of east, meaning it's going towards the southeast direction. If it turns left, depending on its current direction. For example, if you're facing southeast (like 45 degrees south of east), a left turn would be towards the south. Wait, no. Wait, facing southeast, left would be towards south? No, if you face southeast, left would be towards south? Wait, imagine facing southeast. Your left side is towards the south. So turning left would make you head more south. Wait, maybe not. Let me use coordinates.

Let me define the initial direction. Let's assume that the initial direction is such that the angle between the east direction and the plane's path is 35 degrees towards south. So if we model this as a vector, the direction is 35 degrees below the positive x-axis (east). So in standard position, that's 360 - 35 = 325 degrees. Now, turning left would mean rotating the direction counterclockwise? Wait, when you turn left while moving forward, the direction changes counterclockwise. Wait, suppose the plane is moving along a certain direction. When it turns left, the angle increases counterclockwise. But since the current direction is 325 degrees (or -35 degrees), turning left would add to that angle. Wait, if the plane is moving at 325 degrees, turning left (counterclockwise) would increase the angle. For example, adding 7 degrees. So new angle would be 325 + 7 = 332 degrees. But 332 degrees in standard position is equivalent to -28 degrees. Which would mean 28 degrees south of west? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe my coordinate system is messed up.

Wait, another approach. Let's think of the initial direction as 35 degrees south of east. So, if you draw a line from the origin going east, then the plane is moving 35 degrees towards the south from there. So, if you imagine a protractor, with east as the reference. Turning left would be towards the south. Wait, no. If you are facing east and turn left, you turn towards north. But the plane is already going south of east. Hmm. This is confusing. Maybe it's better to think in terms of compass directions.

Imagine a compass rose. East is to the right. South is down. If the plane is flying 35 degrees south of east, that means it's heading in a direction that is 35 degrees from east towards south. So, if you were to draw this, it's a line going from the origin at 35 degrees below the east axis. So, if you are facing east, and turn 35 degrees towards south (right?), wait, no. If you're facing east and turn towards south, that's a right turn. Wait, no. Facing east, turning left would be towards north, turning right would be towards south. Wait, yes! If you're facing east (right side), turning left (towards north) would be a left turn, but the plane is supposed to turn left. Wait, but the problem states the plane is flying 35 degrees south of east, then turns left. So, if it's going south-east direction, turning left would take it more towards the south. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the direction as a vector.

Suppose the initial direction is 35 degrees south of east. So, relative to the east axis, it's 35 degrees downward. So, if you imagine the direction as a vector, its angle from the east axis is 35 degrees towards the south. Now, turning left would mean rotating the direction counterclockwise. Wait, but in navigation, left turns are considered as decreasing the bearing. Wait, bearings are often measured clockwise from north. But here, the problem refers to angles south of east, so maybe different.

Alternatively, think of the direction as an angle from the east axis. Initially, it's 35 degrees towards south. So, if we consider that as a positive angle measured clockwise from east, then turning left would decrease that angle? No, because turning left would mean increasing the angle towards the north. Wait, this is getting too confused. Let me try to use coordinate systems properly.

Let me set up a coordinate system where the positive x-axis is east, and the positive y-axis is north. So, standard Cartesian coordinates. The initial direction of the plane is 35 degrees south of east. That means it's in the fourth quadrant. To represent this direction as an angle from the positive x-axis, it would be -35 degrees, or equivalently 360 - 35 = 325 degrees. 

Now, the plane turns 7 degrees to the left. What does this mean in terms of the angle? If the plane is moving along a direction of 325 degrees (or -35 degrees), turning left would mean rotating the direction counterclockwise. Wait, in standard position, angles increase counterclockwise. So, if the plane is moving along -35 degrees (which is equivalent to 325 degrees), turning left (counterclockwise) would add to the angle. So, adding 7 degrees to the angle. Therefore, the new angle would be -35 + 7 = -28 degrees, or 360 - 28 = 332 degrees. 

So, the new direction is 332 degrees in standard position. Now, we need to express this as degrees south of east. Wait, how do we convert that back? Let's see. 332 degrees is equivalent to -28 degrees, which means it's 28 degrees below the positive x-axis (east), but in the fourth quadrant. Wait, but that would mean 28 degrees south of east? Wait, no. If the angle is measured clockwise from east, then 28 degrees south of east would be equivalent to 28 degrees below the x-axis, which is the same as -28 degrees in standard position. So, if the new direction is -28 degrees, that's 28 degrees south of east. But wait, the original direction was 35 degrees south of east. After turning left, it becomes 28 degrees south of east. Wait, that seems like it's decreasing the angle, which would mean the plane is now closer to east. But turning left from a direction that's south of eastâ€”does that make sense?

Wait, let me check with an example. Suppose the plane is flying directly east (0 degrees). Turning left would be heading north. If it's flying directly south (180 degrees), turning left would be heading east. So, if the plane is flying south of east, which is between east and south. Turning left would mean turning towards the south. Wait, no. Wait, if you're facing east and turn left, you face north. But if you're facing south of east, like 35 degrees south of east, which is slightly south of east. So, imagine you're moving in a direction that's mostly east but slightly south. Turning left would mean turning towards the north. Wait, but that would make the direction more towards east-north? Wait, this is conflicting with previous calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion arises from the definition of "left" in the context of the plane's movement. When a plane is moving in a certain direction, turning left means the direction changes in the way that the nose of the plane points to the left. So, if the plane is moving 35 degrees south of east, which is a direction that's southeast, then turning left would mean turning towards the south. Wait, no. Let's think of the plane's heading. If you are moving 35 degrees south of east, your heading is towards the southeast. If you turn left, you are turning towards the south. Wait, no. Imagine facing southeast. Turning left would point you more towards the south. For example, if you're facing southeast (45 degrees south of east), turning left would bring you to 45 degrees south of west? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I need to use trigonometry.

Alternatively, maybe the angle between the original direction and the new direction is 7 degrees. The original direction is 35 degrees south of east. If the plane turns left by 7 degrees, then the new direction is 35 - 7 = 28 degrees south of east? Wait, that would make sense. Because turning left from south of east would reduce the angle towards east. Wait, but earlier calculation suggested otherwise. There's inconsistency here. Why?

Because the direction of the turn depends on the orientation. If the plane is heading south of east (say, direction is 35 degrees from east towards south), then turning left would mean turning towards the south. Wait, no. If you are moving east and turn left, you go north. But if you are moving south of east, turning left would depend on which way the left is. Let me think of the plane's movement. If the plane is moving along a path that's 35 degrees south of east, then its direction is such that from the east axis, it's angled 35 degrees towards the south. So, imagine standing at the origin, facing east. You turn 35 degrees towards south, which would be a right turn. Wait, no. If you face east and turn towards south, that's a right turn. But the plane is turning left. So, if the plane is moving south of east, turning left would mean turning towards the north? That would make the angle smaller. Wait, if the original direction is 35 degrees south of east, turning left would make it less south, i.e., closer to east. So, subtracting 7 degrees from 35 gives 28 degrees south of east. That would mean the new course is 28 degrees south of east. So, the answer would be 28 degrees. But why did the previous calculation suggest adding 7 degrees to the angle?

Ah, here's the crux. The confusion comes from whether turning left corresponds to increasing or decreasing the angle. If the plane's direction is measured as an angle from east towards south (clockwise), then turning left would mean decreasing that angle. For instance, if the plane is heading 35 degrees south of east, turning left (which would be towards the north) reduces the angle. So, the new angle would be 35 - 7 = 28 degrees south of east. Hence, the answer is 28 degrees.

But this contradicts the previous calculation where adding 7 degrees gave -28 degrees. So which one is correct? It depends on how the turn is defined. Let me resolve this once and for all.

Assume that the initial direction is 35 degrees south of east. This means the angle between the east direction and the plane's path is 35 degrees, measured towards the south. Now, turning left means the plane is turning towards the north. Therefore, the angle between the east direction and the new path decreases by 7 degrees. Hence, 35 - 7 = 28 degrees south of east. Thus, the new course is 28 degrees south of east.

Therefore, the answer is 28 degrees. So, looking at the options, assuming they have 28 as an option. But the user mentioned that the answer choices are "No choices found." Wait, the original problem didn't provide answer choices. Wait, the user said "ANSWER CHOICES: No choices found." So maybe the answer is 28, and the correct choice is whatever corresponds to that. But since there are no choices listed, the assistant needs to provide the numerical answer. However, according to the instructions, the answer must be selected from the given answer choices, but in this case, there are none. However, the user probably intended that the answer is 28, so the Final Answer should be the corresponding letter. But without knowing the actual choices, I cannot know the letter. However, the problem might have been part of a larger set where the answer is 28, which would be option C, for example. But since the user hasn't provided the choices, I can't select the exact letter. But according to the problem statement, the answer is 28 degrees. So, assuming that the correct answer is 28, the Final Answer would be whichever letter corresponds to 28. But since the answer choices aren't given, maybe the user made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 35-7=28, so the answer is 28 degrees. Hence, the final answer is 28. But since the user's instruction says to pick from the answer choices, but there are none, I'll proceed under the assumption that the answer is 28, and thus the correct choice is whatever represents that. However, the user may have had answer choices labeled A-D, but they are missing. Given that, perhaps the answer is 28, and the correct choice is C, for example. But since I don't have access to the choices, I'll conclude with the numerical answer, but per the instructions, I need to choose a letter. Since the problem likely has answer choices with 28 as an option, and assuming it's option C, the Final Answer would be C. However, without knowing the actual choices, this is speculative. But based on the calculation, the answer is 28 degrees.
