MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

Starting with the geometric shapes mentioned. There's a circle C, and two lines AC and BC, each being radii of the circle. So points A and B are on the circumference of circle C, and C is the center. Both radii have length 11 meters, so AC = BC = 11 m. Also, the lines AC and BC are perpendicular, forming a right angle at point C. That means angle ACB is a right angle. 

Since AC and BC are radii and they're perpendicular, triangle ABC must be a right-angled triangle with legs of 11 m each. Wait, but hold on—triangle ABC? Wait, points A, B, and C form a triangle where two sides are radii and the included angle is 90 degrees. So the triangle ABC has a right angle at C. Therefore, AB would be the hypotenuse. Let me calculate the length of AB. Using Pythagoras: AB² = AC² + BC² = 11² + 11² = 121 + 121 = 242. So AB = sqrt(242) = 11√2 meters. But maybe that's useful later.

Now, there's an arc AB mentioned, which is part of the circle. Then there's a sector CAB, which is the region bounded by the two radii CA, CB, and the arc AB. The area of this sector needs to be calculated. Additionally, there's a square S, and we're told to subtract the area of the square from the area of the sector. Wait, the question says "Sub(AreaOf(S), AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)))" but actually looking back, the original problem states "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S))". Wait, the user wrote "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S))", which probably means subtract the area of the square from the sector's area. Wait, but the problem says "Find the area of the shape shown." Hmm, perhaps the shape is the sector minus the square?

Wait, let me recheck the problem statement. The question says "Find the area of the shape shown," and the answer options are not listed, but the user mentions "answer choices: No choices found." Maybe the actual problem had options, but here it's presented without them. However, the user wants us to find the exact value based on the given predicates. 

So, the key elements are: 
- A circle with radius 11 m.
- Points A and B on the circle such that AC and BC are radii, and angle ACB is a right angle (since they are perpendicular). 
- Arc AB is part of the circle.
- Sector CAB is formed by the two radii and arc AB.
- Square S is involved, with its area subtracted from the sector's area? Or is the shape the sector minus the square?

Wait, the last predicate is "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S))", which suggests that the area we need is the area of the sector minus the area of the square S. But what is the square S? How is the square defined? The problem doesn't explicitly state how the square relates to other elements, but perhaps it's constructed using the triangle or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is inscribed in some way. Wait, since AC and BC are perpendicular radii, and if we consider triangle ABC, which is a right-angled isoceles triangle. If we construct a square on one of its sides... Wait, but the problem mentions "Square(S)", so maybe the square S has sides equal to the radius? Or maybe the square is built on the hypotenuse AB? 

Wait, let me think again. Since AC and BC are radii of length 11 m, and angle at C is 90 degrees, the triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle with legs 11 and 11. The hypotenuse AB is 11√2. Now, if there's a square involved, perhaps the square is constructed on the hypotenuse AB? For example, a square with side AB. But then the area would be (11√2)^2 = 242. Alternatively, maybe the square is constructed on the legs AC and BC. But since AC and BC are both 11, maybe the square has sides of 11? But then area would be 121. 

But the problem mentions "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S))"—so the area of the sector minus the area of square S. To compute that, I need to know the area of the sector and the area of square S. 

First, let's compute the area of the sector CAB. The central angle for the sector is 90 degrees because angle ACB is a right angle. The formula for the area of a sector is (θ/360) × πr². Here θ is 90°, r = 11 m. So area = (90/360) × π × 11² = (1/4) × π × 121 = (121π)/4 ≈ 30.25π. 

Now, what about the square S? The problem doesn't specify how the square is related to the diagram, but since the question asks for the area of the shape shown, and the last predicate involves subtracting the square's area from the sector's area, I need to infer what the square represents. 

Possibly, the square is constructed on the triangle ABC. Since ABC is a right-angled triangle, maybe the square is on the hypotenuse AB. If AB is the hypotenuse, then the square would have side AB = 11√2, making its area (11√2)^2 = 242. Then the area of the sector is 121π/4, and subtracting the square's area would give 121π/4 - 242. But that seems like a possible candidate. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is built on the legs AC and BC. Since AC and BC are both 11 m, if the square is constructed with side equal to 11, then its area is 121. Subtracting that from the sector area gives 121π/4 - 121. 

Which interpretation is correct? The problem mentions "Square(S)" but doesn't define it. However, considering standard geometric problems, sometimes squares are constructed on the sides of triangles. Given that the sector is part of the circle, and the square could be on the same base as the triangle. Another possibility is that the square is inscribed within the sector. But that's less likely. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square whose sides are the radii. Wait, if AC and BC are radii, and they are perpendicular, then maybe constructing a square with sides along AC and BC? That would make a square with vertices at C, A, some point, and another point. But that's unclear. 

Another thought: the problem includes the predicate "Arc(A,B)" and "Sector(C,A,B)". So the sector is the region bounded by arcs AB and the two radii. The square might be inside this sector. But without more info, it's challenging. However, given that the answer requires subtracting the square's area from the sector's area, and the problem mentions "the shape shown," which isn't visible here, we have to rely on the given predicates. 

Wait, maybe the square is the square formed by connecting points A, B, and others. Wait, if we have triangle ABC, which is right-angled, and then construct a square on top of it. For example, extending the legs to form a square. Suppose the square is constructed such that one corner is at C, and sides along AC and BC. That would form a square with side length 11, area 121. Then the sector area is 121π/4, and the difference would be 121π/4 - 121. 

Alternatively, if the square is built on AB, the hypotenuse, then area is 242. Which one is more plausible? Considering that the problem uses the term "shape shown," which might imply that the area is the sector minus the square. In many textbook problems, such configurations involve subtracting a square from a sector. 

Let me check the math again. Let's assume that the square has side length equal to the radius, 11 m. Then its area is 121. The sector area is (1/4)*π*11^2 = (121π)/4. The difference would be (121π)/4 - 121. Factor out 121, that becomes 121*(π/4 - 1). 

Alternatively, if the square is built on AB, which is 11√2, then area is (11√2)^2 = 242. Then the difference would be (121π)/4 - 242. 

But which one is correct? Without seeing the diagram, it's ambiguous. However, considering common geometric problems, the subtraction often refers to a square constructed on one of the sides of the triangle. Since AC and BC are radii, maybe the square is on those legs. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square whose diagonal is equal to the radius. Wait, but that's speculative. 

Wait, another clue: the problem mentions "Square(S)" and "AreaOf(S)". So the square S is a separate entity. Perhaps it's a square with sides equal to the radius? Or maybe the square is formed by the two radii and something else. 

Alternatively, perhaps the square is the square inscribed in the circle. But the circle has radius 11, so diameter 22. The largest square that fits in a circle has its diagonal equal to the diameter. So if the square is inscribed in the circle, its diagonal is 22, hence side length s satisfies s√2 = 22 → s=11√2. Area would be (11√2)^2 = 242. Again, leading to the same calculation as before. 

But the problem says "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(...)), AreaOf(S))", implying that the square is a different entity. If the square is inscribed in the circle, then its area is 242. Then the area of the sector is 121π/4. So the difference would be 121π/4 - 242. 

But which interpretation is correct? Let me try to see if there's another way. 

Looking back at the initial predicates, the only mention of the square is "Square(S)". It's possible that the square is constructed using the triangle ABC. For instance, if we take triangle ABC (right-angled at C), and build a square on the hypotenuse AB. Then the area of the square would be AB² = (11√2)^2 = 242. 

In that case, the area of the sector is 121π/4, and the area of the square is 242. So the desired area would be the sector minus the square: 121π/4 - 242. 

Alternatively, if the square is built on the leg AC or BC, then area is 121. But without knowing the exact construction, it's hard to tell. 

However, given that the problem includes the predicate "Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C))" and "RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B))", which defines the right angle at C, and the square might be related to that. If the square is constructed on the legs AC and BC, then it's a square with sides of 11, area 121. 

But again, without more info, it's ambiguous. However, in many cases, such problems refer to the square constructed on the hypotenuse. Let's proceed with that assumption. 

Thus, assuming the square has area 242, and the sector area is 121π/4, the difference would be 121π/4 - 242. This simplifies to 121(π/4 - 2). 

But wait, let me verify if there's another approach. Alternatively, if the square is the square with side equal to the radius, then area is 121, and the difference is 121π/4 - 121 = 121(π/4 - 1). 

Which one is more plausible? The problem says the figure has a radius of 11 m. If the square is related to the circle, then maybe it's the square inscribed in the circle, giving area 242. 

But another thought: the square may be the square whose sides are the radii. Wait, if you have two radii AC and BC, which are perpendicular, then maybe the square is formed by moving from A to B to some point, but that's not clear. 

Alternatively, think of the square as having sides equal to the length of the radius. For example, if the square has sides of length 11, then area is 121. 

Given that the problem includes the predicate "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(...)), AreaOf(S))", and since the answer is expected to be an exact value, both possibilities are candidates. However, let's look for clues in the problem structure. 

The problem mentions "Arc(A,B)" and "Sector(C,A,B)", so the sector is defined by points A, B, and center C. The square S is mentioned separately. If the square is related to the triangle ABC, then perhaps it's the square with side AB, which would be the hypotenuse. 

But I need to choose between these two possibilities. Let's think of standard problems. For example, a common problem is to find the area of a segment (which is sector minus triangle), but here it's sector minus square. If the square were the triangle, then it would be sector minus triangle, but here it's a square. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square formed by the two radii and parts of the circle. But I'm stuck. 

Wait, perhaps there's another way. Let me recall that the area of the sector is (1/4)πr² = (1/4)π(121) = 121π/4. If the square S has area equal to the area of triangle ABC, then the area of the triangle would be (1/2)*11*11 = 121/2. But the problem says "Square(S)", not triangle. 

Alternatively, if the square is constructed on the triangle's hypotenuse, as in the Pythagorean theorem. For example, if the square has side AB, then area AB² = 242. 

Assuming that, then the area of the shape is sector area minus square area: 121π/4 - 242. To simplify, factor out 121: 121(π/4 - 2). 

But the problem might expect a numerical coefficient. Let me compute 121π/4 - 242. Let's write it as 121π/4 - 242. Is there a simpler way to express this? Well, 242 is 2*121, so 121π/4 - 2*121 = 121(π/4 - 2). 

But the problem asks for an exact value. Depending on the answer choices, but since the user hasn't provided them, I'll assume that this expression is acceptable. However, if the square was instead 11x11, then the answer would be 121π/4 - 121 = 121(π/4 - 1). 

But how to decide? Let me think again. The problem states that the figure has a radius of 11 m. The square's area could be inferred from the given data. Since the problem includes "Square(S)", and the rest of the predicates don't mention anything else about the square, maybe the square is constructed in relation to the triangle ABC. 

For example, if the square is constructed on the legs AC and BC, forming a square with side length 11, then its area is 121. Hence, the area of the shape (sector minus square) is 121π/4 - 121. 

This seems plausible. Let me check units: everything is in meters, so area is in square meters. 

Alternatively, if the square is built on AB, the hypotenuse, then area is 242. 

But without more context, it's hard to say. However, since the problem includes "Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C))" and "RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B))", which defines the right angle at C, maybe the square is formed by extending the sides AC and BC. For instance, creating a square with sides AC and BC as adjacent sides. That would mean the square has side length 11, area 121. 

Therefore, the area of the shape would be the sector area (121π/4) minus the square area (121), resulting in 121π/4 - 121. 

To write this as a single fraction: 121(π/4 - 1) = (121π - 524)/4. 

But unless there's a specific form required, either expression is acceptable. However, since the problem asks for an exact value, and both forms are exact, but perhaps the simplest is 121(π/4 - 1). 

But how does this relate to the answer choices? Since the user said "no choices found," perhaps the answer is simply expressed as 121π/4 - 121, which is equivalent to 121(π/4 - 1). 

But I need to confirm once more. Let me think: if the square is built on the legs AC and BC, which are both 11, then yes, area is 121. So the area of the shape is sector minus square. 

Yes, that seems logical. Thus, the final answer should be 121π/4 - 121. 

But the problem might require combining terms. Let me compute it numerically if needed. But the question says to provide an exact value, so leaving it in terms of π is fine. 

So the exact value is 121π/4 - 121. 

But the answer choices aren't available, so I have to present this as the answer. However, the user instructions say to select from answer choices labeled A-D, but since they are not provided, the assistant is supposed to output the correct letter. But since there are no choices, perhaps the intended answer is one of these expressions, and the user expects me to pick the correct one based on my reasoning. 

But since I have to choose between A, B, C, D, and the user didn't provide them, maybe there's a mistake. However, the original problem might have had specific options, but they are missing here. Assuming that the correct answer is 121(π/4 - 1), which simplifies to (121π - 524)/4, but without knowing the answer choices, I can't map it. 

Wait, but the problem might have been expecting the area of the sector minus the area of the square, where the square has side equal to the radius. So 121π/4 - 121. 

Assuming that this is the case, and the answer is this value, but since the answer choices aren't given, perhaps the correct answer is this expression. 

But according to the instructions, I need to choose from answer choices A-D. Since the user mentioned "No choices found," but the system requires me to select one of A-D, maybe there was an error. However, given that I have to proceed, I'll assume that the answer is 121(π/4 - 1), and if the answer choices included this, it would be the correct one. 

But since I have to choose a letter, and the problem might have had options like A) 121π/4 - 121, B) ... etc., but since I don't have that info, I can't know. However, the user's instruction says "select the correct answer choice," but since there are none, I'm forced to assume that the correct answer is the one I derived. 

Given that, I'll conclude that the answer is 121π/4 - 121, which is equivalent to 121(π/4 - 1). So, if this were one of the choices, it would be selected. Since the user didn't provide choices, but the system requires selecting a letter, I'll assume that this corresponds to option A, B, C, or D. 

But since I cannot know, and the problem originally might have had specific options, but due to the absence of choices, I'll proceed with the answer as per the derivation. However, the final step requires choosing one of the letters. Since I can't determine the exact mapping, but the process leads to the expression above, I'll proceed to finalize with the assumption that this is the correct answer and select the corresponding letter, even though it's arbitrary. 

But given that the problem might have had the answer as 121(π/4 - 1), which is approximately 121*(0.785) - 121 = 95.185 - 121 = negative number, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be. Wait, π/4 is approximately 0.785, so π/4 - 1 is negative. But area can't be negative. So this suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong. 

Ah! Wait, this indicates a critical error. If the area of the sector is 121π/4 and the area of the square is 121, then subtracting the square from the sector would result in a negative number, which is impossible. Therefore, my previous assumption must be incorrect. 

That means the square must have an area smaller than the sector. Let me recalculate. 

If the square's area is larger than the sector, then the subtraction would yield a negative value, which is impossible. Hence, the square must have an area smaller than the sector. 

So, let me reevaluate. If the square is inscribed in the circle, then its area is 242, while the sector area is 121π/4 ≈ 95.03. So 95.03 - 242 is negative, still invalid. 

Wait, this suggests that my entire approach is wrong. What's the issue here? 

Ah! Wait, the problem says "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(...)), AreaOf(S))", which is the sector area minus the square area. If this results in a positive number, then it's valid. 

So, for the sector area to be greater than the square area, the square's area must be less than the sector area. 

So, if the square is constructed on the legs AC and BC (each 11), area is 121. The sector area is 121π/4 ≈ 95.03. So 95.03 - 121 is negative. Still invalid. 

Hmm. This implies that my assumptions about the square are wrong. 

Alternative idea: Perhaps the square is not constructed on the legs or hypotenuse, but elsewhere. 

Wait, the square could be the square whose side is equal to the radius, but placed in a way that its area is less than the sector. 

Wait, if the square has area 121, and the sector area is 121π/4 ≈ 95.03, which is less than 121, so subtraction would be negative. Not possible. 

So, this suggests that my understanding of the square's size is incorrect. 

Maybe the square is not constructed on the radius, but somewhere else. Let me reconsider. 

Wait, the problem mentions "Square(S)", but no further details. Could the square be the square formed by the two radii and the chord AB? No, that would be a rhombus, not a square. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is formed by the intersection of the circle and some lines. 

Wait, perhaps the square is inscribed in the sector? For example, a square inside the sector. But how? 

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square with side equal to the radius, but rotated. 

Wait, another approach: perhaps the square is the square whose diagonal is equal to the radius. So, if the diagonal is 11, then the side s satisfies s√2 = 11 → s = 11/√2. Area is s² = 121/2 = 60.5. Then the sector area is 121π/4 ≈ 95.03, so 95.03 - 60.5 ≈ 34.53, which is positive. 

But why would the square have a diagonal equal to the radius? That's speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the square has side equal to the radius divided by √2, making its area 121/2. 

But this is too much guesswork. 

Wait, going back to the problem statement: the given predicates include "Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C))" and "RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B))", which confirms the right angle at C. The two radii are AC and BC. 

The square S: perhaps it's the square formed by the two radii and two other segments? Or maybe it's the square with side AC, which is 11. 

But if the square has side AC, which is 11, then its area is 121. 

But then, as before, the sector area is ~95, and subtracting 121 would be negative. 

This suggests that the problem's description might have a typo, or I've misinterpreted the relationship between the square and the sector. 

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the area of the sector plus the square? But the predicate says Sub(AreaOf(Sector(...)), AreaOf(S)). 

Alternatively, perhaps the square is outside the sector, and the area is the sector plus the square. But that would contradict the subtraction. 

Wait, let me read the problem again: "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S))". So it's the area of the sector minus the area of the square. 

If this is positive, then the area of the sector must be greater than the area of the square. 

So, let's think: what square has area less than 121π/4 ≈ 95.03? 

For example, if the square has area 60.5, as before, then 95.03 - 60.5 = 34.53. 

But how to derive that? 

Perhaps the square is inscribed in the circle, but with its diagonal equal to the radius. Wait, if the diagonal is 11, then area is (11^2)/2 = 121/2 = 60.5. 

But why would the square have diagonal equal to the radius? 

Alternatively, the square is inscribed in the triangle ABC. For a right-angled triangle, the maximum square that fits inside has a certain area. 

For a right-angled triangle with legs a and b, the area of the largest square that can fit inside with one side on the hypotenuse is (a*b)/(a + b). Here, a = b = 11, so area is (11*11)/(11+11) = 121/22 = 5.5. But this is very small. 

Alternatively, the square could be constructed such that one of its sides is along the altitude of the triangle. But this is getting too complicated. 

At this point, I realize that without knowing the exact configuration of the square S, it's impossible to determine the correct area. However, since the problem is from a standardized test or textbook, there might be a standard interpretation. 

Revisiting the initial problem: the figure has a radius of 11 m. The given predicates include two radii, a right angle, and a sector. The square is mentioned, and the area is the sector minus the square. 

Perhaps the square is the square formed by the two radii and the arc, but that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, another idea: the square could be the square whose sides are the two radii and the chord AB. But that would form a rhombus, not a square. 

Alternatively, the square is the square with side equal to the length of the radius, but placed such that it's partially overlapping the sector. 

But this is too vague. 

Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should consider that the area of the shape is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle ABC. But the problem mentions a square, not a triangle. 

Wait, the problem says "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(...)), AreaOf(S))", so it's definitely the square, not the triangle. 

Maybe the square is the square with side equal to the radius, and the area is 121, and the sector area is 121π/4. Even though the subtraction gives a negative value, perhaps the problem assumes absolute value or there's a different configuration. 

Alternatively, perhaps the square is constructed externally on the sector, and the area is the sector plus the square. But the predicate says subtraction. 

I'm at an impasse. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the area of the sector is 121π/4 and the square's area is 121, and assuming that the problem might have a typo and meant to add instead of subtract, the area would be 121π/4 + 121. But this is speculation. 

Alternatively, if the square is the square with side equal to the radius, and the area is 121, and the problem is asking for the area of the sector plus the square, then the answer would be 121π/4 + 121. 

But since the problem specifies subtraction, I'm forced to reconsider. 

Wait, maybe the square is the square with side equal to the length of the arc AB? No, the arc length is not specified. 

Alternatively, the square is the square with perimeter equal to the circumference of the circle. The circumference is 2πr = 22π, so perimeter of square is 22π, hence side is 22π/4 = 11π/2, area is (11π/2)^2 = 121π²/4. But this seems unlikely. 

At this point, I think I need to revisit the problem from scratch, ensuring I haven't missed any predicates. 

The given predicates are:

- Circle(C)
- IsRadiusOf(Line(A,C), Circle(C))
- IsRadiusOf(Line(B,C), Circle(C))
- LengthOf(Line(A,C),11)
- LengthOf(Line(B,C),11)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)),LengthOf(Line(B,C)))
- Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C))
- RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B))
- Arc(A,B)
- Sector(C,A,B)
- Square(S)
- AreaOf(S)
- AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B))
- Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S))

So, the key entities are:

- Circle C with center at C (wait, no, the circle is named C, but Line(A,C) and Line(B,C) are radii. So the circle's center is point C. So circle C has center at C, and points A and B are on the circumference. 

- Lines AC and BC are radii, so they are from the center C to points A and B on the circle. 

- The angle at C is 90 degrees, as AC ⊥ BC. 

- Arc AB is part of the circle. 

- Sector CAB is the sector defined by points C, A, B. 

- Square S: unspecified, but it's a square. 

- The problem asks for the area of the shape, which is Sub(AreaOf(Sector(...)), AreaOf(S)). 

So, the area is the area of the sector minus the area of square S. 

But to determine the area of S, we need to know what the square is. Since the problem doesn't specify, but all other entities are defined in terms of the circle and points A and B, it's possible that the square is the square with side equal to the radius. 

Even though this leads to a negative area, perhaps the problem assumes that the square is inside the sector, and the area is taken as absolute value, or there's a different configuration. 

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square formed by the two radii and the chord AB. But that would form a kite, not a square. 

Wait, let's calculate the area of the square if it's the square with side equal to the radius. Area is 11² = 121. 

Sector area is (1/4)π(11)² = 121π/4 ≈ 95.03. 

Subtracting gives 95.03 - 121 = -25.97, which is negative. This is impossible. 

Hence, this suggests that the square must have an area less than the sector. 

If the square is inscribed in the circle, its area is 242, which is greater than the sector area, leading to negative. 

If the square is smaller, like with side 11/√2, area is 121/2 = 60.5. Then the area would be 95.03 - 60.5 = 34.53. 

But how to justify this? 

Maybe the square is inscribed in the triangle ABC. For a right-angled triangle with legs 11 and 11, the area of the largest square that can be inscribed with one side on the hypotenuse is (11*11)/(11 + 11) = 121/22 = 5.5. 

But this is too small. 

Alternatively, the square is constructed such that one vertex is at C, and extends along AC and BC. This would form a square with side 11, area 121. 

But this leads to a negative area. 

At this point, I realize that there must be a misunderstanding in interpreting the predicates. Let me re-examine the predicates. 

The predicate "Square(S)" is mentioned, but no further details. Perhaps S is a square with vertices at A, B, and two other points? 

Wait, if the square has vertices at A, B, and two other points on the circle. But without more info, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, the square is the square with vertices at C, A, B, and another point. But since AC and BC are perpendicular, adding a fourth point to form a square would require finding a point D such that CD is perpendicular to AC and BD is perpendicular to BC, but this is speculative. 

Alternatively, the square is the square formed by rotating the triangle ABC. 

This is too vague. 

Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll conclude that the intended answer is the area of the sector minus the area of the square with side equal to the radius, despite the negative result, assuming that the problem might have a mistake. Alternatively, the correct answer is 121π/4 - 121, and the negative value is acceptable in the context of the problem, even though it's not physically meaningful. 

But this is contradictory. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the area of the square minus the sector? If so, then it would be 121 - 121π/4, which is positive. 

Maybe there was a mistake in the predicate order, and it should be Sub(AreaOf(S), AreaOf(Sector(...))). 

If that's the case, then the area would be 121 - 121π/4, which is positive. 

But without knowing, it's impossible to say. 

Given the ambiguity, and since the problem asks for an exact value, I'll proceed with the assumption that the correct answer is 121π/4 - 121, and select the corresponding letter, even though it's possibly negative. 

But since the problem might have intended the subtraction in the other direction, I'll assume that the correct expression is 121 - 121π/4, which is positive. 

However, without knowing the exact configuration, it's impossible to be certain. 

Given the lack of clarity, I'll conclude that the correct answer is 121π/4 - 121, and since the problem might have had this as an option, I'll select it as the answer.
