====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out how they relate to each other. The main goal is to find the value of x, given some conditions about similar triangles and parallel lines.

Starting with the geometric shapes mentioned: there are points A, B, C, D, E. Triangles AEB and ADC are mentioned, along with several lines connecting these points. Also, EB and DC are parallel. 

The key here is the similarity of the two triangles, AEB and ADC. Since they're similar, their corresponding sides should be in proportion. Let me recall the properties of similar triangles: corresponding angles are equal, and the ratios of corresponding sides are equal. Also, since EB is parallel to DC, maybe there's something about the transversals or similar triangles involved here.

Looking at the given lengths: AE is 3 units, AB is 2 units, BC is 6 units. Then ED is given as 2x - 3. There are also equations involving LengthOf(A,D) and LengthOf(A,C). From the predicates, it says Equals(LengthOf(A,D), Add(LengthOf(A,E), LengthOf(E,D))) and Equals(LengthOf(A,C), Add(LengthOf(A,B), LengthOf(B,C))). So, substituting the known values:

For AD: LengthOf(A,D) = LengthOf(A,E) + LengthOf(E,D) => AD = 3 + (2x - 3) = 2x. Similarly, LengthOf(A,C) = LengthOf(A,B) + LengthOf(B,C) => AC = 2 + 6 = 8. So AC is 8 units.

Now, since triangles AEB and ADC are similar, their corresponding sides should be proportional. But first, I need to identify which sides correspond. The triangles share vertex A, so the order of the letters matters. Triangle AEB has vertices A, E, B; Triangle ADC has vertices A, D, C. So, the correspondence would be A to A, E to D, B to C? Or perhaps another correspondence? Wait, because similarity could have different orders, but since EB is parallel to DC, maybe the correspondence is such that angle at A is common? Wait, but both triangles share point A, so maybe the similarity is AA (Angle-Angle)? Let me think.

Since EB || DC, the corresponding angles formed by the transversal lines might be equal. For example, angle at E in triangle AEB corresponds to angle at D in triangle ADC, and angle at B corresponds to angle at C. Alternatively, maybe angle A is common? Wait, both triangles have vertex A, so angle at A is common? Wait, triangle AEB has angle at A between AE and AB, while triangle ADC has angle at A between AD and AC. Are those angles the same? Not necessarily unless the lines are arranged in a certain way. Hmm.

But since the triangles are similar, their corresponding angles must be equal. Let's consider the correspondence. Suppose triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC. That would mean angle A is common, so that's one pair of equal angles. Then, since EB || DC, the corresponding angles might be equal. Let me try to visualize this.

Alternatively, maybe the correspondence is A-E-B corresponding to A-D-C. So, AE corresponds to AD, EB corresponds to DC, and AB corresponds to AC. Wait, but if that's the case, then the ratio of similarity would be AE/AD = EB/DC = AB/AC. Let me check that.

Given that, we can set up proportions. Let's assume the similarity ratio is k. So, AE / AD = AB / AC = EB / DC. We know AE = 3, AD = 2x (from earlier calculation). AB = 2, AC = 8. So, 3/(2x) = 2/8. Solving that gives 3/(2x) = 1/4 → cross-multiplying: 3*4 = 2x → 12 = 2x → x=6. Wait, but let me confirm if this assumption about the correspondence is correct.

Wait, why do I assume that AE corresponds to AD? Because the triangles are AEB and ADC. So, if the correspondence is A→A, E→D, B→C, then AE corresponds to AD, EB corresponds to DC, and AB corresponds to AC. So yes, that seems plausible. Therefore, the ratio of AE/AD should equal AB/AC. Let me verify this.

So, AE is 3, AD is 2x. AB is 2, AC is 8. So setting up the ratio: 3/(2x) = 2/8 → simplifying 2/8 to 1/4. So 3/(2x) = 1/4 → cross multiply: 3*4 = 2x → 12 = 2x → x=6. So x would be 6. Looking at the answer choices, B is 6. But wait, before accepting that, I need to make sure that the correspondence of the triangles is indeed correct.

Another way to check is to look at the parallel lines. Since EB || DC, then the corresponding angles would be equal. In triangle AEB and ADC, if EB || DC, then the angles at E and D would be corresponding angles. So angle AEB equals angle ADC, and angle ABE equals angle ACD. This suggests that the similarity is due to AA similarity, since two angles are equal. Hence, the correspondence would be triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC, making the ratio of sides as above.

Therefore, solving 3/(2x) = 2/8 gives x=6. However, let's also check the other side ratio, like EB/DC. Wait, but we don't know EB or DC directly. However, since EB || DC, and considering the similarity ratio, perhaps we can use that. But since we already used the ratio of AE/AD and AB/AC, which gave us x=6, and that seems consistent, perhaps that's sufficient.

Alternatively, let's check if ED comes into play here. ED is given as 2x -3. Earlier, we found that AD = 2x. Also, from the given, ED is part of the length AD. Wait, AD is composed of AE + ED? Wait, the predicate says Equals(LengthOf(A,D), Add(LengthOf(A,E), LengthOf(E,D))). So AD = AE + ED. Which means ED = AD - AE. Since AD is 2x, and AE is 3, ED = 2x - 3. Which matches the given expression for ED: 2x -3. So that checks out. Therefore, our previous calculation for x=6 would imply ED = 2*6 -3 = 9. But does that affect anything?

But since we already solved for x via the similarity ratio, and that gives x=6, which is one of the options. Let me just double-check that my assumption about the correspondence was correct.

Suppose instead that the similarity ratio was different. For example, if the correspondence was A→A, E→C, B→D. Wait, but then EB would correspond to CD, but since EB || DC, that might not hold. Alternatively, maybe triangle AEB ~ triangle ADC with a different correspondence. Wait, but the order of the letters in the similarity statement is important. The problem states Similar(Triangle(A,E,B), Triangle(A,D,C)), so the order is A-E-B and A-D-C. Therefore, the correspondence is A→A, E→D, B→C. Thus, the sides opposite these angles would correspond. So AE corresponds to AD, EB corresponds to DC, and AB corresponds to AC. Therefore, the ratio AE/AD = AB/AC. Which leads us to x=6. 

Thus, the answer should be B:6. Let me check again if there's any mistake here.

Wait, another way to approach this: since the triangles are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides is constant. Let's compute the ratio of AB to AC, which is 2/8 = 1/4. Therefore, the ratio of similarity between triangle AEB and ADC is 1/4. Therefore, AE/AD should also be 1/4. Since AE is 3, then AD = 3 / (1/4) = 12. But AD is given as 2x, so 2x = 12 → x=6. Yep, same result. So this confirms x=6. Therefore, the correct answer is B.
