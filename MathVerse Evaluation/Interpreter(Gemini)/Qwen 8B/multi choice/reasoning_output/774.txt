MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand what they mean. 

So, the problem states that a + b = 54 degrees, and one of the angles is 126 degrees. We need to find the value of x. The answer choices are A to E, each representing different degree measures.

Looking at the given predicates:

1. Angle(a) and Angle(b) are mentioned. Also, there's an Angle(x). So these are angles labeled a, b, and x.
2. Equals(SumOf(a,b),54): This means that the sum of angles a and b is 54 degrees.
3. Equals(SumOf(Angle(a), Angle(b), 126), 180): Wait, this seems like adding angle a, angle b, and 126 degrees equals 180. But how does that work? Maybe it's saying that angle a + angle b + another angle (which is 126) equals 180? Or perhaps there's a typo here? Let me check again. Oh, maybe it's SumOf(Angle(a), Angle(b), 126)? That would imply that angle a + angle b + 126 = 180. Wait, but earlier we have a + b = 54. So substituting that, 54 + 126 = 180? Which adds up to 180. That checks out. So that equation is confirming that angle a + angle b is 54, and adding 126 gives 180. Therefore, the third angle in some triangle is 126 degrees. 

Then there's Triangle(1) and Triangle(2). MeasureOf(Angle(1), a) and MeasureOf(Angle(2), b). So triangle 1 has an angle measure a, and triangle 2 has an angle measure b. Then Equals(SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)), 180). Wait, SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x))? So that would be a + b + x = 180? But wait, earlier we had a + b = 54, so substituting that in, 54 + x = 180, which would make x = 126. But that contradicts the previous part where one of the angles is 126. Hmm, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the predicates.

Wait, let me re-examine the predicates carefully. 

First, the first two equations:

- Equals(SumOf(a,b),54): So a + b = 54.
- Equals(SumOf(Angle(a), Angle(b), 126), 180): So angle a + angle b + 126 = 180. Since angle a and angle b are measured as a and b, then substituting a + b = 54 into this equation gives 54 + 126 = 180. Which works because 54+126=180. So that tells us that there's a triangle where two angles are a and b, and the third angle is 126 degrees. Because in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180. So that triangle would have angles a, b, and 126. Therefore, those three angles add up to 180. Hence, a + b + 126 = 180 => a + b = 54, which matches the first equation.

Now, looking at the other part about triangles 1 and 2. MeasureOf(Angle(1), a) and MeasureOf(Angle(2), b). So triangle 1 has an angle measuring a, and triangle 2 has an angle measuring b. Then, Equals(SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)), 180). Wait, the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) equals 180. So that would be a + b + x = 180. But since a + b = 54, substituting gives 54 + x = 180 => x = 126. However, that conflicts with the earlier statement that one of the angles is 126 degrees. Wait, but maybe the x is referring to another angle in a different triangle?

Alternatively, perhaps the MeasureOf(x) refers to an angle in another triangle. Let me think again. The problem says "the figure above" but since we don't have the figure, we have to rely solely on the predicates. 

Another possibility: The SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) could refer to combining angles from different triangles. For example, if there's a triangle where two angles are a and b, and another angle x. Wait, but then the sum would be a + b + x = 180. But earlier, we had a + b = 54, so x would be 126. But then why is there a mention of one of the angles being 126? Perhaps that 126 is the same as x? But that would mean x is 126, but the answer options don't include 126. Wait, the answer choices are 72, 70, 68, 66, 64. None of these are 126. So something's wrong here. 

Wait, maybe I misread the predicates. Let me check again. The second equation was Equals(SumOf(Angle(a), Angle(b), 126), 180). So that is angle a + angle b + 126 = 180. Which implies that the sum of angles a, b, and 126 is 180. So that suggests that there is a triangle with angles a, b, and 126 degrees. Thus, those three angles add up to 180. Therefore, angle a + angle b = 54, and the third angle is 126. 

Then, later, there's another equation: Equals(SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)), 180). So that would be angle a + angle b + x = 180. Since a + b = 54, then 54 + x = 180 → x = 126. But if x is 126, then why is that considered as an answer choice? It's not listed. The answer options are lower than that. So there's a contradiction here. Unless I made a mistake in interpreting the predicates.

Wait, perhaps the MeasureOf(x) isn't referring to an angle in the same triangle? Let me think again. The problem mentions Triangle(1) and Triangle(2), with MeasureOf(Angle(1), a) and MeasureOf(Angle(2), b). So triangle 1 has an angle a, triangle 2 has an angle b. Then, the next predicate is Equals(SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)), 180). So this is summing angle a, angle b, and another angle x. Wait, but if x is an angle in another triangle, then maybe that's part of a different triangle? For example, suppose there's a triangle where two angles are a and b, and the third is x. But then that would give a + b + x = 180. But we already know a + b = 54, so x would be 126. Again, leading to the same conclusion. But that's not among the answer choices. 

But the problem also mentions that one of the angles is 126 degrees. So perhaps that 126 is the same as x? But then x would be 126, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the 126 is part of a different triangle? Let me try to visualize this. Suppose there are two triangles: triangle 1 with angles a, and some other angles; triangle 2 with angles b and some other angles. Then, there's another triangle involving x. 

Alternatively, maybe the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) refers to angles from different triangles. For instance, if triangle 1 has angles a and some other angles, and triangle 2 has angles b and some others, and then there's another triangle where x is an angle. 

Wait, perhaps the key lies in the fact that the problem states "one of the angles is 126°". So maybe the 126° is part of a triangle that includes x. Let me try to consider the possibilities again.

Let me start over. Given that a + b = 54. And that in some triangle, angles a, b, and 126° sum to 180. So that triangle has angles a, b, and 126°, hence a + b + 126 = 180 ⇒ a + b = 54. So that's consistent. Now, the question asks for x, given that in another relationship, a + b + x = 180. Wait, but that would mean x = 126. However, that's conflicting with the answer options. So there's a contradiction unless my interpretation is wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) is not a + b + x, but instead the sum of a, b, and another angle x. Wait, but the way it's written is SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)). If MeasureOf(x) refers to the measure of angle x, then yes, it's a + b + x. 

Wait, but maybe there's more to it. Are there multiple triangles involved? Like, perhaps triangle 1 and triangle 2 are parts of a larger figure? For example, maybe triangle 1 has angles a and some other angles, triangle 2 has angles b and some others, and then there's a third triangle involving x. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem involves supplementary angles or exterior angles. Let me think. If a + b = 54, and one angle is 126°, which could be an exterior angle. For example, in a triangle, an exterior angle equals the sum of the remote interior angles. So if 126° is an exterior angle, then it would be equal to a + b. But a + b is 54, so that doesn't fit. Wait, but 126 is the exterior angle, then the remote interior angles would sum to 126. But in our case, a + b = 54, so that wouldn't align. 

Wait, maybe the 126° is an interior angle in a triangle. Suppose there's a triangle with angles a, b, and 126°, making the total 180. So that fits. Then, another triangle where x is an angle. But how does that relate to the rest?

Wait, the last predicate is Equals(SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)), 180). So that's a + b + x = 180. Since a + b = 54, then x = 126. But again, this leads to x being 126, which isn't an option. So maybe the problem is not directly a + b + x = 180, but something else. 

Wait, perhaps there's confusion between the measure of an angle and the actual angle name. For example, MeasureOf(Angle(x), x) might mean that the measure of angle x is x degrees. So if the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) equals 180, then a + b + x = 180. Which again leads to x = 126. 

This suggests that either there's a miscalculation, or I'm misunderstanding the predicates. Let me check the original problem again. 

The problem states: "a+b = 54, and one of the angles is 126°. What is the value of x?" So, the key is that one of the angles is 126°, which could be the third angle in the triangle with angles a and b. So that triangle has angles a, b, and 126°, hence a + b + 126 = 180 ⇒ a + b = 54. Now, the question is about finding x. 

Perhaps x is another angle in a different triangle. For example, maybe there's another triangle where two angles are a and x, or b and x. Let me think. 

But according to the given predicates, there's another equation: Equals(SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)), 180). Which again suggests that a + b + x = 180. So x = 126. But this isn't in the answer choices. 

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to a straight line? If a + b + x = 180, but if x is an external angle or something. Or maybe there's a transversal or something. Alternatively, maybe the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) is not in the same triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves two triangles. For example, triangle 1 has angles a and some other angles, and triangle 2 has angles b and some other angles. Then, there's another triangle where x is an angle. 

Wait, but without seeing the figure, it's challenging. But the problem mentions that one of the angles is 126°. So maybe that 126° is x? But then x would be 126, which isn't in the options. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me try to look for alternative interpretations. 

Wait, the initial problem says: "a+b = 54, and one of the angles is 126°." So, maybe the 126° is not the third angle in the triangle with a and b, but rather another angle elsewhere. 

Suppose there's a triangle with angles a and b, and another angle which is 126°, making the sum a + b + 126 = 180, so a + b = 54. Then, there's another triangle where x is one of the angles. But how does that connect to the rest? 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a linear pair or supplementary angles involved. For example, if one angle is 126°, then its supplement is 54°, which would be a + b. But that's just speculation. 

Wait, but the problem says "the figure above," which we don't have. So perhaps there's a diagram with two triangles sharing a common side or something. 

Given the ambiguity, maybe I should focus on the equations given in the predicates. Let's list them again:

1. a + b = 54
2. a + b + 126 = 180 → confirms a + b = 54
3. a + b + x = 180 → x = 126
4. One of the angles is 126°

But x is supposed to be one of the answer choices. Since none of the options are 126, perhaps I'm missing something. 

Wait, maybe the 126° is the measure of x? But then x would be 126. Or maybe the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) equals 180, but MeasureOf(x) refers to a different angle. Wait, maybe x is not the measure of angle x, but something else. 

Wait, the predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(x), x). So the measure of angle x is x. So that means angle x has measure x degrees. Then, in the equation SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) equals 180, that is a + b + x = 180. So x = 126. But again, not in options. 

Hmm. There's a contradiction here. Unless there's a miscalculation. Let me check again. 

From the first equation: a + b = 54. Second equation: a + b + 126 = 180 → 54 + 126 = 180, which is correct. Third equation: a + b + x = 180 → 54 + x = 180 → x = 126. So x = 126. But the answer choices do not include 126. So either the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting the predicates. 

Wait, perhaps the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) is not a + b + x, but something else. For example, if MeasureOf(x) refers to a different variable. Let me read the predicates again. 

The predicates include MeasureOf(Angle(x), x). So the measure of angle x is x degrees. So the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) would be a + b + x. 

But if that's the case, then x = 126. But since that's not an option, maybe there's a different interpretation. 

Wait, perhaps the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) is referring to angles from different triangles. For example, in triangle 1, there's angle a, and in triangle 2, there's angle b, and then x is an angle in another triangle. But how would that relate? 

Alternatively, maybe the 126° is not part of the same triangle as a and b. Let me think. Suppose there's a triangle with angles a and b, and another triangle with angle 126°, and then x is an angle in yet another triangle. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. However, given the constraints provided, the only equation we have involving x is a + b + x = 180, leading to x = 126. Since that's not in the options, there must be a different approach. 

Wait, maybe the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) is not a + b + x, but something else. For example, if x is an angle in a triangle with angles a and b, but then it would be a + b + x = 180. But again, that gives x = 126. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves a triangle where x is the exterior angle. An exterior angle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles. So if x is an exterior angle, then x = a + b = 54. But that would make x = 54, which isn't an option either. 

Alternatively, if x is an interior angle in a triangle with angles a and b. Wait, but then a + b + x = 180, giving x = 126. 

This is perplexing. Perhaps there's an error in the problem setup, or I'm missing a key detail. Let me try to think differently. 

Wait, the problem says "one of the angles is 126°." So maybe that 126° is x? But then x = 126, which isn't in the options. Or maybe it's part of a different calculation. 

Wait, maybe the equation involving x is not a + b + x = 180, but a + x = 180? No, the predicate says SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) equals 180. 

Alternatively, perhaps the MeasureOf(x) is not x, but another angle. Let me check the predicate: MeasureOf(Angle(x), x). This likely means that the measure of angle x is x degrees. So MeasureOf(x) is x. 

Thus, the equation a + b + x = 180. With a + b = 54, x = 126. 

Since this is not an option, perhaps the question is not asking for x directly, but for something else. Wait, the question says: "What is the value of x?" So x is the measure of the angle. 

But the answer options are all less than 126. So this suggests that my interpretation is incorrect. 

Wait, maybe the equation is not a + b + x = 180, but a + x = 180? How? Let me check the predicate again: Equals(SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)), 180). So that's the sum of a, b, and MeasureOf(x). So if MeasureOf(x) is x, then it's a + b + x = 180. 

Unless there's a typo in the predicate, such as it should be SumOf(a, MeasureOf(x)), which would be a + x = 180. In that case, x = 180 - a. But since a + b = 54, and if there's another relation, like b = 126, then a = 54 - b = 54 - 126 = negative, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, maybe the equation is SumOf(a, MeasureOf(x)) = 180. If so, then a + x = 180. But since a = 54 - b, and if b is 126, then a would be negative. Not possible. 

Wait, but the problem states that one of the angles is 126°. So maybe one of a, b, or x is 126. If a + b = 54, then neither a nor b can be 126. So x must be 126. But again, not in options. 

This is very confusing. Maybe the problem involves supplementary angles. For example, if a + b = 54, and 126° is supplementary to x. So x = 180 - 126 = 54. But 54 isn't in the options either. 

Alternatively, if the 126° is supplementary to a + b, which is 54. So 126 + 54 = 180. But that's just the sum of the two angles. 

Wait, maybe x is the supplement of a + b? But that would be 180 - 54 = 126, which brings us back to x = 126. Still not matching the options. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to see if there's another way. Maybe the problem involves a triangle with angles a, x, and 126°, and another triangle with angles b and x. Or something like that. 

If there's a triangle with angles a and x, and another angle, say, y. Similarly for triangle with angles b and x. But without knowing the relationships, it's difficult. 

Wait, the problem mentions two triangles: Triangle(1) and Triangle(2). MeasureOf(Angle(1), a) and MeasureOf(Angle(2), b). So triangle 1 has an angle measuring a, and triangle 2 has an angle measuring b. So possibly, triangle 1 has angles a and something, and triangle 2 has angles b and something. 

If there's another triangle involving x, perhaps triangle 1 and 2 are connected. For example, if they're part of a larger figure, like a quadrilateral or something. 

For example, if triangles 1 and 2 are adjacent, forming a quadrilateral. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, perhaps x is an exterior angle to one of the triangles. For instance, if x is an exterior angle to triangle 1, then it would be equal to the sum of the remote interior angles. But if triangle 1 has an angle a, then the exterior angle x would be equal to the sum of the other two angles of triangle 1. But we don't know those. 

Wait, if triangle 1 has angles a and some other angles, and x is an exterior angle, then x = sum of the other two angles. But unless we know more about triangle 1, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe the two triangles are part of a larger triangle. For example, if triangle 1 and triangle 2 are combined to form a larger triangle. 

But I'm going around in circles here. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, maybe I should consider that the correct answer is 126, but since that's not an option, perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: 

"Given the predicates... Equals(SumOf(Angle(a), Angle(b), 126), 180)" — this means that angle a + angle b + 126 = 180. So angle a + angle b = 54. 

Then, another predicate: Equals(SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)), 180). Which would be angle a + angle b + x = 180. So x = 126. 

But since x is 126, which isn't an option, perhaps the actual question is asking for the supplement of x? Or maybe there's a different interpretation of the predicates. 

Wait, maybe the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) is not the sum of the three angles, but something else. For example, if a and b are sides, and x is an angle. But the predicates mention angles, so probably not. 

Alternatively, maybe the MeasureOf(x) is not x, but another value. For example, if MeasureOf(x) is the measure of angle x, which is some value. But the predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(x), x), which likely means that the measure of angle x is x degrees. 

At this point, I'm forced to conclude that either there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm missing something. Given the answer choices, and assuming that x is not 126, perhaps the correct answer is 180 - 126 = 54, but that's not an option either. 

Wait, another idea: Maybe the 126° is an exterior angle to the triangle with angles a and b. So the exterior angle is 126°, which equals the sum of the remote interior angles, which are a and b. So a + b = 126. But earlier, we have a + b = 54. Contradiction. 

No, that doesn't fit. 

Wait, maybe the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) is meant to represent something else. Like, if x is an angle in a triangle with angles a and b, but then it would be a + b + x = 180. 

But if one of the angles is 126°, then maybe x is 126°, and a + b = 54. But again, x = 126 is not an option. 

Maybe the problem is asking for the value of x in a different context. For example, if x is an angle in a triangle with angles 126° and another angle. But without more info, it's unclear. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should consider that the intended answer is 180 - 126 = 54, but that's not in options. Or maybe 180 - (a + b) = 180 - 54 = 126. Still no. 

Wait, maybe the correct answer is 180 - 126 - a = 54 - a. But without knowing a, this is not helpful. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles a, x, and 126°, then a + x + 126 = 180. So x = 54 - a. But we don't know a. 

But from the first equation, a + b = 54. If we assume that b is 126, then a = 54 - 126 = -72, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if x is 126, then the sum of a + b + x = 180 would require a + b = 54, which is true. But x = 126 is not in the options. 

Since this is a standardized test question, and the options are A to E, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me think: 

Maybe the problem involves supplementary angles. For example, if a + b = 54, and one of the angles is 126°, which is supplementary to x. So 126 + x = 180 → x = 54. But 54 isn't an option. 

Or, if x is supplementary to a + b, then x = 180 - 54 = 126. Again, not in options. 

Wait, but the answer choices are 72, 70, 68, 66, 64. These are all even numbers decreasing by 2. Maybe there's a calculation where x = 180 - 126 - a, but since a + b = 54, and if b is part of another equation... 

Wait, let's try to consider that one of the angles is 126°, which could be angle x. So x = 126. But not in options. Or maybe x is supplementary to 126°, so x = 54. Still not. 

Alternatively, if the 126° is part of a triangle with x and another angle. For example, if x + 126 = 180, then x = 54. 

But again, not in options. 

At this point, I'm stuck. Given that the only logical conclusion from the given equations is x = 126, but that's not an option, I suspect there might be a mistake in the problem or my interpretation. However, considering the answer choices, perhaps the correct answer is 180 - 126 - a, where a is one of the angles. But without knowing a, this is impossible. 

Wait, maybe the problem involves two triangles: one with angles a, b, and 126°, and another with angles a, x, and some other angle. But without more info, I can't proceed. 

Alternatively, maybe the SumOf(a, b, MeasureOf(x)) is not a + b + x, but a + MeasureOf(x) + b. Wait, that's the same thing. 

I think I've exhausted all possibilities and keep arriving at x = 126, which isn't an option. This suggests either a problem error or a misinterpretation. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is 180 - 126 = 54, but that's not in options. 

Wait, let's check the answer choices again: A.72 B.70 C.68 D.66 E.64. All are multiples of 2, descending by 2. Maybe there's a calculation where x = 180 - 126 - b, and since a + b = 54, then b = 54 - a. But without knowing a or b, this is still unknown. 

Alternatively, if there's a triangle with angles a, x, and b, then a + x + b = 180 → x = 180 - (a + b) = 180 - 54 = 126. Same result. 

Since I'm stuck, I'll assume that the correct answer is 126, but since it's not an option, perhaps there's a typo and the correct answer is 54, but that's not in options either. 

Wait, the answer choices are all below 126, so maybe the actual question is asking for the supplement of x, which would be 180 - x = 126 → x = 54. Still not in options. 

Alternatively, if x is part of a triangle with angles 126 and another angle, then x = 180 - 126 - a. But without knowing a, I can't calculate. 

I think I've tried everything and keep hitting dead ends. Given the time I've invested and the lack of progress, I'll have to go with the only logical conclusion from the given data, even though it's not in the options. But since the user requires selecting from the options, maybe there's a different approach. 

Wait, let me try one more time. The problem says "a+b = 54, and one of the angles is 126°. What is the value of x?" 

Assuming that the 126° is the measure of x, then x = 126. Not in options. 

Alternatively, if the 126° is the sum of a and x, then a + x = 126. Since a + b = 54, then x = 126 - a. But without knowing a, I can't find x. 

But if there's another equation involving a and b, like from the triangles. 

Wait, the problem mentions Triangle(1) and Triangle(2). MeasureOf(Angle(1), a) and MeasureOf(Angle(2), b). So triangle 1 has an angle measuring a, and triangle 2 has an angle measuring b. 

If these are right triangles, then perhaps the other angles can be determined. For example, if triangle 1 is a right triangle with angle a, then the other angle is 90 - a. Similarly for triangle 2. 

But how does this relate to x? 

If x is an angle in a different triangle, say, a triangle formed by combining triangles 1 and 2, or something. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, if x is the third angle in a triangle where two angles are a and b, then x = 126. But again, not in options. 

I'm truly at a loss. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll have to make an educated guess. Since the only feasible calculation leads to x = 126, which isn't an option, but the closest option is 126 - 60 = 66, which is option D. Maybe there's a miscalculation somewhere. 

Wait, let me try to think: If a + b = 54, and one of the angles is 126, which is x. Then, x = 126. But since that's not an option, maybe the question meant that the sum of a and x is 126. So a + x = 126. Since a + b = 54, then x = 126 - a. But without knowing a, we can't find x. 

However, if there's another equation involving a and b, like from the triangles. For example, if triangle 1 has angles a and some other angle, say c, and triangle 2 has angles b and d. But without more info, I can't proceed. 

I think I've used up all possible avenues. I'll choose the closest option, but this is uncertain. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 180 - 126 - a, and since a + b = 54, and if b is 126, then a = -72, which is invalid. 

I'm forced to conclude that there's an error in the problem, but since I must choose from the options, I'll take a chance and pick the closest one, which might be D.66. But this is purely a guess.
