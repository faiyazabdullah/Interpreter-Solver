MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about the graph of y = 2^x and its domain. The options are A through D, each giving different ranges for x. 

First, I need to recall what the domain of a function means. The domain is all the possible x-values that can be input into the function. For exponential functions like y = 2^x, I think the domain is usually all real numbers because you can raise 2 to any real power. But maybe there's something specific here.

Looking at the given predicates: Line(x), Line(y), Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y)), Equals(Pow(2,x),y). Wait, these seem like they're part of some geometric setup. Let me parse them again. Maybe the problem is combining geometric concepts with the equation y=2^x? Or perhaps it's about the graph being represented as two lines that are perpendicular? Hmm, but the equation y=2^x isn't a straight line. It's an exponential curve. 

Wait, maybe the predicates are trying to represent the graph in a coordinate system. Let me think. The first two predicates say Line(x) and Line(y), but in standard math, x and y are variables, not lines. Unless they're referring to axes? Like, the x-axis and y-axis? Then Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y)) would mean the x-axis and y-axis are perpendicular, which they are. That makes sense. So the coordinate system is set up with perpendicular axes. 

Then Equals(Pow(2,x),y) – that seems like the equation y = 2^x. So the graph of this equation is plotted on the coordinate plane where the axes are perpendicular. Now, the question is about the domain of this graph. 

But how does the rest of the predicates relate? Well, the main thing is understanding the domain of y = 2^x. As I thought earlier, exponentials with positive bases (like 2) are defined for all real numbers. So x can be any real number. Therefore, the domain should be all real x. 

But wait, the answer choices have options. Let me check again. The options are A.x ≥ 0, B.x > 0, C.All real x, D.x < 0. So if the domain is all real numbers, then answer C. But why would the problem mention the y-intercept being 1? Because when x=0, y=2^0=1, so that checks out. Also, all values are greater than 0, which is true since 2^x is always positive. 

So the domain is all real numbers. Therefore, the answer should be C. But let me make sure there's no trick here. Sometimes problems might restrict domains for certain reasons, but in this case, since it's just y=2^x, there's no restriction. The graph exists for every real x. So yeah, the domain is all real x. Hence, the correct answer is C.
