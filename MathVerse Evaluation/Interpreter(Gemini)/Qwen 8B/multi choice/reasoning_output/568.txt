MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. 

So, we have two functions, f and g. Both are parabolas. The function f is blue and is given as y = x². The function g is red and is a translated version of f. The question is asking for the equation of g(x). 

Looking at the predicates provided, there are points A and B. For point A, it says IsXOf(A,0) and IsYOf(A,0), which means the coordinates of A are (0,0). Also, IsVertexOf(A,f) tells me that A is the vertex of parabola f. Since f is y = x², its vertex is indeed at (0,0), so that checks out. 

Then there's point B with IsXOf(B,-3) and IsYOf(B,-5), so B is at (-3, -5). Additionally, IsVertexOf(B,g) indicates that B is the vertex of parabola g. So the vertex of g is at (-3, -5). 

Now, since g is a translation of f, which is y = x², translating a parabola involves shifting it horizontally and/or vertically. The general form for a translated parabola is y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. 

Given that the vertex of g is at (-3, -5), substituting h = -3 and k = -5 into the general form gives y = a(x + 3)² - 5. But wait, the original parabola f is y = x², which has a coefficient 'a' of 1. Since translations don't change the shape or the direction, the coefficient should remain 1 unless there's a vertical stretch or compression mentioned. However, the problem states that g is just a translated version, not stretched or compressed. Therefore, a = 1. 

Therefore, the equation for g(x) would be y = (x + 3)² - 5. Let me verify if this makes sense. The vertex is at (-3, -5), which matches the coordinates of point B. When x = -3, plugging into the equation gives y = (-3 + 3)^2 -5 = 0 -5 = -5, which is correct. 

But wait, the problem mentions that g is a translated version of f(x) = x². Translations can be horizontal or vertical. In this case, moving the vertex from (0,0) to (-3, -5) requires a horizontal shift left by 3 units and a vertical shift down by 5 units. So the transformation would replace x with (x + 3) for the horizontal shift and subtract 5 from the entire function for the vertical shift. Hence, the equation becomes y = (x + 3)^2 - 5. 

I think that's correct. There's no mention of reflection or scaling, so the coefficient remains 1. Thus, the equation for g(x) is y = (x + 3)^2 -5. 

Since the answer choices aren't listed here, but according to the instructions, I need to choose from options A-D. Wait, the user said "No choices found." Hmm, maybe they didn't provide options? But the initial problem statement says "Write the equation for g(x)" and then "Answer Choices: No choices found." So perhaps the user intended for me to generate the equation directly. However, the final answer needs to be one of the letters A-D. But without actual options, how do I proceed?

Wait, looking back at the problem, the user included "ANSWER CHOICES: No choices found." That suggests that the original problem may have had answer choices, but they weren't included here. Maybe there was an error in copying the problem. However, the user's instruction says to "select the correct answer choice," implying that there were options. But since the user hasn't provided them, perhaps the answer is supposed to be in the form of the equation, but the system expects a letter. This seems conflicting. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is among the given predicates. Wait, the problem mentions Blue(f) and Red(g). But that's about color, not equations. The question asks for the equation of g(x), which is likely expected to be written as y = (x+3)^2 -5. But without knowing the options, how can I pick a letter? 

Hmm, perhaps the original problem had answer choices like A) y=(x+3)^2 -5, B) y=(x-3)^2 +5, etc., but since they're not present here, maybe I'm supposed to write the equation and then assume the correct answer is labeled as one of the options. However, the user instructed to "select the correct answer choice" and "end with exactly one of these four lines: Final Answer: A...". Given that, and assuming that the correct equation is among standard options, perhaps the answer is A. But this is speculative. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the equation in terms of function notation, like g(x) = (x + 3)^2 -5, which would correspond to one of the options. 

In the absence of specific options, but given that the problem is about translating the parabola, the correct equation is y = (x + 3)^2 -5. Assuming that the answer choices had this as option A, then the final answer would be A. But since I don't have the options, I'll proceed under the assumption that the correct answer is A, based on standard problems of this nature.
