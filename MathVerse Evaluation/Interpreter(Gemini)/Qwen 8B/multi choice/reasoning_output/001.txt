MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. 

So, we have triangle ABC with points D on AB and E on AC. DE is parallel to BC. Also, there are some angle measures given: angle at A is 80 degrees, angle at B is 60 degrees. Then there's mention of similar triangles ADE and ABC, and some relations about angles. The question asks for the measure of angle CED.

Let me start by recalling that if two lines are parallel, like DE and BC here, then corresponding angles are equal. Since DE is parallel to BC, the transversal AB would create corresponding angles. Wait, but DE is part of triangle ADE, so maybe I should consider the similar triangles mentioned.

Given that Triangle ADE is similar to Triangle ABC. Similarity implies that their corresponding angles are equal. So angle A is common to both triangles. Therefore, angle AED corresponds to angle ACB, and angle ADE corresponds to angle ABC. But wait, the problem also states that angle AED equals angle ABC? Let me check the given predicates again.

Looking back, there's a predicate saying Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C))). Wait, angle at A for triangle ADE is the same as angle at A for triangle ABC? Wait, no—wait, the Angle(A,D,E) would be angle at D in triangle ADE. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the correspondence of the similar triangles.

Wait, the similarity is between Triangle ADE and Triangle ABC. So the order matters. So vertex A corresponds to A, D corresponds to B, and E corresponds to C? Or maybe another order? Because similar triangles require matching angles. Let me think.

Since DE is parallel to BC, by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem), AD/AB = AE/AC. Which suggests that triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC by AA similarity because they share angle A and have corresponding angles equal due to DE || BC. So yes, similarity via AA.

Therefore, the angles in triangle ADE correspond to those in ABC. So angle at A is common, angle ADE corresponds to angle ABC, and angle AED corresponds to angle ACB.

But the problem mentions that measure of angle AED equals measure of angle ABC. Wait, according to the given predicates: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C))). Wait, angle(A,D,E) is angle at D in triangle ADE, which would correspond to angle at B in triangle ABC. Wait, maybe my initial assumption about the correspondence was wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the similarity is such that angle at A corresponds to angle at A, angle at D corresponds to angle at B, and angle at E corresponds to angle at C. So angle ADE corresponds to angle ABC. Therefore, angle ADE equals angle ABC. Similarly, angle AED equals angle ACB. But the given predicates say that measure of angle AED equals measure of angle ABC. That seems conflicting unless angle ACB equals angle ABC, which isn't necessarily true here.

Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine the given predicates. There's a predicate that says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C))). So angle(A,D,E) is angle at D in triangle ADE, which would be the same as angle ADE. And angle(A,B,C) is angle at B in triangle ABC. So according to this, angle ADE equals angle ABC. But since DE is parallel to BC, angle ADE should be equal to angle ABC because they are alternate interior angles. Yes! Because DE || BC, and AB is a transversal cutting them, so angle ADE (at D) and angle ABC (at B) are alternate interior angles, hence equal. So that checks out.

Similarly, angle AED would be equal to angle ACB. So angle AED equals angle ACB. Now, since the sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees, and given that angle A is 80 degrees, angle B is 60 degrees, so angle C is 180 - 80 - 60 = 40 degrees. Therefore, angle ACB is 40 degrees, so angle AED is also 40 degrees.

Now, the question is asking for angle CED. Let me visualize triangle CED. Point D is on AB, E is on AC, so connecting D-E. We need to find angle at E, which is angle CED. Wait, angle CED is the angle at point E between points C, E, D. So in triangle CED, angle at E.

Hmm. How do we find that? Let me think about the configuration. Points D on AB, E on AC, DE parallel to BC. So quadrilateral DECB is a trapezoid with DE || BC. Alternatively, considering triangle CED, maybe we can find some relationships.

Alternatively, perhaps looking at triangle CED and triangle something else. Since DE || BC, then maybe triangle CED is similar to another triangle? Or use some properties of parallel lines and transversals.

Alternatively, since we know angles in triangle ADE and triangle ABC, perhaps we can find other angles in triangle CED.

First, let's note down the angles in triangle ABC:

Angle at A: 80°, angle at B: 60°, angle at C: 40°, as computed earlier.

In triangle ADE, since it's similar to triangle ABC, the angles are the same. So angle at A is still 80°, angle at D is equal to angle at B (60°), and angle at E is equal to angle at C (40°). Wait, but angle at E in triangle ADE would be angle AED, which we said is 40°, as per the given equality. So in triangle ADE, angles are 80°, 60°, 40°, adding up to 180°, which works.

Now, looking at point E on AC. So AE is part of AC. Let me try to find coordinates or express ratios. But maybe there's a better way.

We need to find angle CED. Let me look at triangle CED. To find angle at E, which is angle CED. Let's see if we can find other angles in triangle CED or relate it to other parts.

Note that DE is parallel to BC, so the distance between DE and BC is constant. Maybe considering the slopes or vectors, but perhaps more straightforward with angles.

Let me consider the straight line AC. Point E is on AC. So from point E, we have ED going towards D on AB. So angle CED is formed at E between CE and ED.

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle CED. Let's see: points C, E, D. We know EC is part of AC, and ED is the segment from E to D. So angle at E is between EC and ED.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle CEB or something else. Wait, but how?

Another approach: Since DE is parallel to BC, then the ratio of AD/AB = AE/AC. Let's call this ratio k. So AD = k*AB, AE = k*AC. But without knowing the actual lengths, maybe we can assign variables.

Alternatively, since we know angles in triangle ADE, perhaps we can compute sides in terms of ratios. For example, in triangle ADE, angles are 80°, 60°, 40°. In triangle ABC, angles are 80°, 60°, 40°. So the triangles are similar, so their sides are proportional.

But how does that help us find angle CED?

Let me think about the location of point E. Since E is on AC, and DE is parallel to BC. So, if I extend ED beyond D, but maybe not helpful.

Wait, maybe looking at the angles around point E. At point E, we have angle AED (which is 40°, as established earlier) and angle CED. Are these adjacent angles forming a linear pair? Wait, if we consider line EC and ED, then angle AED and angle CED could be supplementary if points A, E, C are colinear and ED forms some relation.

Wait, point E is on AC. So line EC is just the extension from E to C along AC. So at point E, the line ED goes from E to D, and the line EC goes from E to C. So the angle between ED and EC is angle CED. Meanwhile, angle AED is the angle between EA and ED. Since EA and EC are in a straight line (since E is on AC), angle AED + angle CED = 180°, because they form a linear pair along line AC.

Wait, that seems promising! Because at point E, the lines EA and EC are opposite directions (since E is on AC). So angle AED and angle CED are adjacent angles forming a straight line. Hence, their sum is 180 degrees. Therefore, angle CED = 180° - angle AED.

Earlier, we determined angle AED is equal to angle ACB, which is 40 degrees. So angle CED = 180° - 40° = 140°. But wait, that would make angle CED 140°, which is one of the options (option D).

But let me confirm this logic. Since E lies on AC, then the line EC is the same as line AC extended beyond C? No, E is between A and C. So from point E, moving along EC goes towards C. From E, moving along ED goes towards D. So angle between ED and EC is angle CED. The angle between EA and ED is angle AED. Since EA and EC are in a straight line (as E is on AC), then angle AED and angle CED are supplementary. Thus, angle CED = 180° - angle AED.

Yes, that makes sense. So angle AED is 40°, so angle CED is 140°, which would be option D.

But wait, let me double-check. If angle AED is 40°, then angle CED = 180 - 40 = 140°, which is answer D. However, sometimes in such problems, depending on the diagram, the angle might be reflex, but in standard cases, it's the smaller angle. But 140° is obtuse, which is possible.

But let me verify once more. Another approach: in triangle CED, if we can find other angles. For instance, angle at D and angle at C. But we might not have enough info.

Alternatively, since DE is parallel to BC, then the corresponding angles at D and B are equal. So angle ADC (if that exists) equals angle ABC. Wait, but angle at D in triangle ADE is 60°, as per the similarity. But angle ADC is part of triangle ADC. Wait, maybe not directly helpful.

Alternatively, considering triangle CED. Let me think about the angles. At point C, angle ECD is part of angle ACB, which is 40°. But how much of it is taken by angle ECD?

Wait, point E is on AC, so EC is a segment from E to C. So angle at C in triangle CED is angle ECD, which is the same as angle ACB minus angle ECB? Not sure. Wait, since E is on AC, then EC is just the same line as AC from E to C. So angle ECD is part of angle ACB. Wait, but if we're looking at triangle CED, the angle at C is angle ECD, which is the same as angle ACB, because EC is along AC. Wait, no. Wait, angle at C in triangle CED is angle ECD, which is the angle between EC and CD. But CD is a segment from C to D. Wait, but D is on AB. So CD connects C to D on AB. This seems complicated.

Alternatively, maybe focusing back on the previous conclusion. If angle AED is 40°, then angle CED is 140°, making answer D. But let me check if angle AED is indeed 40°.

From the given predicates: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C))). So angle AED (angle at E in triangle ADE) equals angle ABC (which is 60°)? Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, angle(A,B,C) is angle at B in triangle ABC, which is 60°. So according to the given predicate, angle AED equals angle ABC, which is 60°. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought where I thought angle AED equals angle ACB (40°). Where did I go wrong?

Oh no! Here's a mistake. Earlier, I thought angle AED equals angle ACB, but according to the given predicate, angle AED equals angle ABC. Let me re-express this carefully.

The given predicate is: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,D,E)), MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C))).

Angle(A,D,E) refers to angle at D in triangle ADE, which is angle ADE. Wait, no. Wait, angle(A,D,E) is the angle at point D between points A, D, E. Wait, no—the notation MeasureOf(Angle(X,Y,Z)) refers to the angle at Y between X-Y-Z. So Angle(A,D,E) is the angle at D between A-D-E. So that's angle ADE. So the given predicate says that angle ADE equals angle ABC (which is 60°). So angle ADE is 60°, not angle AED.

Earlier, I confused angle ADE with angle AED. So that was my mistake. Let me correct that.

So angle ADE (at D) equals angle ABC (60°). And angle AED (at E) equals angle ACB (40°), based on the similarity of triangles ADE and ABC. Wait, but the similarity of triangles ADE and ABC would mean that angle AED corresponds to angle ACB. So angle AED is 40°, as before. So angle at E in triangle ADE is 40°, which is angle AED.

Then, returning to the earlier idea: at point E, angle AED is 40°, and since E is on AC, the line EC extends from E to C, so the angle between ED and EC (which is angle CED) plus angle AED (between EA and ED) equals 180°, because they are adjacent angles forming a straight line along AC. So angle CED = 180° - angle AED = 180° - 40° = 140°, which would be answer D. But wait, angle AED is 40°, so angle CED is 140°, which is option D. But let me check again.

But wait, why is angle AED equal to angle ACB? Because of the similarity between triangles ADE and ABC. Since triangle ADE ~ triangle ABC, angle AED corresponds to angle ACB. So angle AED = angle ACB = 40°, which is correct. So angle AED is 40°, leading to angle CED being 140°, so answer D.

However, I need to ensure that the similarity is correctly applied. Given that DE is parallel to BC, triangles ADE and ABC are similar by AA similarity, since angle A is common, and the other angles are equal due to the parallel lines. Therefore, angle ADE corresponds to angle ABC (so angle ADE = 60°), and angle AED corresponds to angle ACB (so angle AED = 40°). Thus, angle AED is 40°, leading to angle CED being 140°, which would be option D. 

But wait, another way to check: in triangle CED, what are the angles? Let me consider triangle CED. We know angle at E is 140°, angle at D is... Well, angle at D in triangle CED is angle CDE. What is that?

At point D, angle CDE is part of triangle CDE. Let me think. Point D is on AB. So angle at D in triangle CDE is angle CDE. How to find that?

Alternatively, since DE is parallel to BC, then angle CDE is equal to angle CBD, which is angle at B in triangle ABC, which is 60°, because they are alternate interior angles. Wait, BD is part of AB, so line DE is parallel to BC, and line DC is a transversal. So angle CDE is equal to angle CBD, which is angle at B (60°). Therefore, in triangle CDE, angles are:

At E: 140°, at D: 60°, so the remaining angle at C is 180 - 140 - 60 = -20°, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be. So there's a contradiction here. Which means my assumption is wrong.

Wait, that suggests an error in reasoning. If angle CDE is 60°, then in triangle CDE, angles would be 140° at E, 60° at D, and angle at C would be negative, which is impossible. So there must be an error in assuming angle CDE is 60°. So where is the mistake?

Ah, angle CDE is not angle CBD. Because DE is parallel to BC, and DC is a transversal. But DC connects D to C. So line DC intersects DE and BC. Wait, DE is parallel to BC, and DC is a transversal. So angle between DC and DE (which is angle CDE) is equal to angle between DC and BC, which is angle BCD. Wait, but angle BCD is angle at C in triangle ABC, which is 40°, because angle ACB is 40°. Wait, but angle BCD is the same as angle ACB? No, point D is on AB, so DC connects D to C. So angle between DC and BC would depend on where D is located.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the angles. Let me draw mentally: DE is parallel to BC. So, when line DC crosses DE and BC, the alternate interior angles would be angle CDE and angle DBC. Wait, angle DBC is angle at B, which is 60°, so angle CDE would be equal to that. Hence, angle CDE = angle DBC = 60°, as alternate interior angles. So angle CDE = 60°, as before. But then in triangle CDE, angles would be 140° at E, 60° at D, leaving angle at C as -20°, which is impossible. So clearly, there's a flaw in this reasoning. 

This indicates that my earlier conclusion that angle CED is 140° may be incorrect. Where is the mistake?

Let me backtrack. The problem arises from assuming that angle AED is 40°, leading to angle CED being 140°, but that leads to inconsistency in triangle CDE. So perhaps my assumption that angle AED is 40° is wrong.

Wait, let's re-express the given information. The similarity between Triangle ADE and Triangle ABC. The correspondence of vertices: since DE || BC, and A is common, the similarity would be ADE ~ ABC. So angle at A corresponds to angle at A, angle at D corresponds to angle at B, and angle at E corresponds to angle at C. Therefore:

- angle ADE corresponds to angle ABC => angle ADE = 60°
- angle AED corresponds to angle ACB => angle AED = 40°
- angle at A is common (80°)

Thus, in triangle ADE, angles are 80°, 60°, 40°, which adds up to 180°, correct.

So angle AED is 40°, which is the angle at E in triangle ADE. Now, considering point E on AC, and the line ED. At point E, the line ED forms angle AED (40°) with EA. Since E is on AC, the line EC continues from E to C. Thus, the angle between ED and EC is angle CED. As EA and EC are in a straight line, the sum of angle AED and angle CED must be 180°, making angle CED = 180° - 40° = 140°. But this leads to the problem in triangle CDE. So why is there a contradiction?

Because if angle CDE is 60°, and angle CED is 140°, then angle at C in triangle CDE would be 180 - 140 - 60 = -20°, which is impossible. Hence, there must be an error in assuming angle CDE is 60°. Why did I assume that angle CDE is 60°? Because DE || BC, and DC is a transversal. So angle CDE is equal to angle DBC (alternate interior angles). But angle DBC is angle at B in triangle ABC, which is 60°, so angle CDE should be 60°. But if that's the case, then triangle CDE has angles summing to more than 180°, which is impossible. Therefore, this suggests that my assumption about the correspondence of the similar triangles is wrong.

Wait, maybe the similarity is not ADE ~ ABC, but rather ADE ~ ACB? Or another order? Let me re-examine the given predicates. 

The given predicate is Similar(Triangle(A,D,E), Triangle(A,B,C)). So Triangle ADE is similar to Triangle ABC. So the order of the vertices in the similarity is important. So the correspondence is A -> A, D -> B, E -> C. Hence:

- angle at A corresponds to angle at A
- angle at D corresponds to angle at B
- angle at E corresponds to angle at C

Thus, angle ADE corresponds to angle ABC, angle AED corresponds to angle ACB. Hence, angle ADE = 60°, angle AED = 40°, as before.

But if that's the case, then angle CDE is equal to angle DBC (alternate interior angles), which is angle ABC = 60°, making angle CDE = 60°. But then, in triangle CDE, angles are 140° at E, 60° at D, and angle at C would be 180 - 140 - 60 = -20°, which is impossible. So where's the error?

Ah! Perhaps the line DC is not intersecting BC, because D is on AB, so DC connects D (on AB) to C. But DE is parallel to BC, so DC is not a transversal to BC. Wait, DE is parallel to BC, and DC is a line from D to C. So, DE || BC, and DC is a line from D to C. So, angle CDE is not an alternate interior angle with respect to any transversal. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in identifying the alternate interior angles.

Let me consider DE || BC. The line DC intersects DE at D and BC at C. So, DE and BC are cut by transversal DC. Therefore, the alternate interior angles would be angle CDE and angle BCD. Wait, angle BCD is the angle at C between BC and CD. But angle BCD is part of angle ACB in triangle ABC. Since angle ACB is 40°, and angle BCD is a portion of it, depending on where D is. Wait, but D is on AB, so CD is a cevian from C to D on AB. So, angle BCD is not necessarily equal to angle ABC. 

Wait, but if DE || BC, then the alternate interior angles would be angle CDE and angle BCD. So angle CDE = angle BCD. But angle BCD is part of angle ACB. Let me denote angle BCD as x. Then angle CDE = x. In triangle CDE, angles are at D: x, at E: 140°, and at C: ?

Wait, angle at C in triangle CDE is angle ECD. Which is part of angle ACB. Since angle ACB is 40°, and angle ECD is part of it. Let me denote angle ECD as y. So angle ECD = y. Then, in triangle CDE, the sum of angles is x + 140 + y = 180 → x + y = 40°.

Also, in triangle ABC, angle ACB = 40°, which is composed of angle BCD (x) and angle ECD (y), assuming that E is on AC and D is on AB, so CD splits angle ACB into x and y? Wait, no. Because E is on AC, and D is on AB. CD is a line from C to D. So, angle BCD is part of angle ACB. Wait, point D is on AB, so CD is connecting C to D. So angle at C between BC and CD is angle BCD, which is part of angle ACB. So angle ACB = angle BCD + angle ECD? No, because E is on AC, and CD is from C to D. So, angle at C between BC and CD is angle BCD. Then, angle ECD is the angle between EC and CD. But EC is along AC, so angle ECD is the same as angle ACB minus angle BCD? Or is it?

Actually, since EC is along AC, angle ECD is the same as angle ACB. Wait, no. Because EC is part of AC. So from point C, line CD goes to D, and line CE is along CA. So angle between CD and CE is angle ECD, which is the same as angle ACB. Wait, no. Because angle at C between CB and CD is angle BCD, and angle at C between CD and CE is angle ECD. But since CE is along CA, angle ECD is the supplement of angle BCD? Or depends on the position.

Wait, this is getting too vague. Perhaps instead of trying to calculate angles in triangle CDE, focus back on the earlier conclusion that angle CED = 140°, even though it led to inconsistency. But that suggests an error in assumptions.

Alternatively, maybe angle CED is not 140°, but another value. Let's think differently. 

Since angle AED is 40°, and at point E, we have line EC extending from E to C. So, if we consider triangle AEC, but not sure. Alternatively, consider triangle ADE and triangle CDE.

Wait, let's think about the entire diagram. DE is parallel to BC, so the ratio of AD/AB = AE/AC = k. Let's denote this ratio as k. Then, coordinates might help. Let me assign coordinates to the points to calculate.

Assume coordinate system: Let’s place point A at (0,0), B at (b,0), and C at (c,d). But maybe it's easier to choose specific coordinates for simplicity. Since angle at A is 80°, angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 40°. Let me construct triangle ABC with these angles. 

For simplicity, let me take AB as horizontal axis. Let me set coordinates:

Let’s assume AB is along x-axis, with A at (0,0), B at (1,0). Let me find coordinates of C such that angle at A is 80°, angle at B is 60°, and angle at C is 40°. Using Law of Sines:

a / sin A = b / sin B = c / sin C

Where a is BC, b is AC, c is AB.

But perhaps assigning specific lengths. Let’s assume AB = 1 unit. Then, using Law of Sines:

AB / sin C = BC / sin A = AC / sin B

So AB = 1, angle C = 40°, angle A = 80°, angle B = 60°.

Thus:

BC = (sin A / sin C) * AB = (sin 80° / sin 40°) ≈ (0.9848 / 0.6428) ≈ 1.533

AC = (sin B / sin C) * AB = (sin 60° / sin 40°) ≈ (0.8660 / 0.6428) ≈ 1.347

Now, coordinates of C can be found. Assuming A(0,0), B(1,0). Let's find coordinates of C.

Using Law of Cosines or coordinates. Let me use coordinates. Let’s place point A at origin (0,0), point B at (1,0). Let’s find coordinates of C(x,y).

From angle at A is 80°, so the slope of AC makes an angle of 80° with AB (x-axis). So direction of AC is 80° from x-axis. Length of AC is approximately 1.347 units. So coordinates of C are:

x = AC * cos(80°) ≈ 1.347 * cos(80°) ≈ 1.347 * 0.1736 ≈ 0.233

y = AC * sin(80°) ≈ 1.347 * 0.9848 ≈ 1.327

So C is approximately at (0.233, 1.327). 

Now, point D is on AB, let's say at (d, 0), where 0 < d < 1. Point E is on AC. Since DE || BC, the coordinates of E can be determined based on the ratio.

The vector from A to B is (1,0), and from A to C is (0.233, 1.327). Let’s parameterize points D and E.

Since DE || BC, the slope of DE should equal the slope of BC.

Slope of BC: (y_C - y_B)/(x_C - x_B) = (1.327 - 0)/(0.233 - 1) ≈ 1.327 / (-0.767) ≈ -1.729.

So slope of DE is -1.729. Let's find coordinates of D(d, 0) and E(e_x, e_y) on AC.

Parametrize AC: from A(0,0) to C(0.233, 1.327). Let parameter t be the fraction from A to C. So E is at t*(0.233, 1.327) = (0.233t, 1.327t).

Point D is at (d, 0) on AB. Line DE connects D(d,0) to E(0.233t, 1.327t). The slope of DE is (1.327t - 0)/(0.233t - d) = 1.327t / (0.233t - d). This should equal slope of BC, which is -1.729.

So:

1.327t / (0.233t - d) = -1.729

Solving for d in terms of t:

1.327t = -1.729*(0.233t - d)

1.327t = -1.729*0.233t + 1.729d

Calculate -1.729*0.233 ≈ -0.402

So:

1.327t + 0.402t = 1.729d

1.729t = 1.729d → t = d.

Wait, that suggests t = d. So this implies that the parameter t is equal to d. But how?

Wait, this suggests that for any t, d = t. So, for example, if we set t = d, then the slope condition holds. This means that the ratio of AD/AB = t, since AD = d - 0 = d, and AB = 1, so ratio is d. Similarly, AE/AC = t, since AE = t*AC. Hence, the ratio AD/AB = AE/AC = t, confirming the proportionality from similar triangles.

Therefore, points D and E divide AB and AC respectively in the same ratio t.

Now, with this setup, we can find coordinates of D and E. Let's pick a specific t to simplify calculations. Let's choose t=0.5 for simplicity.

So, t = 0.5, so d = 0.5. Thus, D is at (0.5, 0), and E is at (0.233*0.5, 1.327*0.5) ≈ (0.1165, 0.6635).

Now, we need to find angle CED. Point C is at (0.233, 1.327), E is at (0.1165, 0.6635), D is at (0.5, 0).

To find angle at E between points C, E, D. So angle CED is the angle at E between points C, E, D.

To calculate this angle, we can use vectors. Compute vectors EC and ED, then find the angle between them.

Vector EC = C - E = (0.233 - 0.1165, 1.327 - 0.6635) ≈ (0.1165, 0.6635)

Vector ED = D - E = (0.5 - 0.1165, 0 - 0.6635) ≈ (0.3835, -0.6635)

Now, the angle between vectors EC and ED can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (EC · ED) / (|EC| |ED|)

Compute EC · ED = (0.1165)(0.3835) + (0.6635)(-0.6635) ≈ 0.0447 - 0.4403 ≈ -0.3956

|EC| = sqrt(0.1165² + 0.6635²) ≈ sqrt(0.0135 + 0.4403) ≈ sqrt(0.4538) ≈ 0.6736

|ED| = sqrt(0.3835² + (-0.6635)^2) ≈ sqrt(0.1471 + 0.4403) ≈ sqrt(0.5874) ≈ 0.7664

So cos(theta) ≈ -0.3956 / (0.6736 * 0.7664) ≈ -0.3956 / 0.516 ≈ -0.766

Thus, theta ≈ arccos(-0.766) ≈ 140°, since cos(140°) ≈ cos(180° - 40°) = -cos(40°) ≈ -0.766. Yes!

So angle CED is approximately 140°, which matches our earlier calculation. This confirms that despite the confusion with triangle CDE angles, the calculation using coordinates gives 140°, so the correct answer is D.

The earlier contradiction in triangle CDE angles was due to miscalculating the relationship between the angles. By using coordinates, it becomes clear that angle CED is indeed 140°, so the correct answer is D.
