MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the length of BD given some angles and a side length. Let me start by going through the given information step by step.

First, the points mentioned are A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines connecting them: AB, BC, CA forming triangle ABC; CE, so point E connected to C. Also, AD, BD, DE. Then there are triangles mentioned like ACE, BCE, etc. Also, some perpendicularity conditions: CE is perpendicular to AB, and AD is perpendicular to BC. Plus, right angles at AEC and BDA. Points D lies on BC and on AD, and E lies on AB and CE. 

Given angles: angle CAE is 61 degrees, angle CBE is 73 degrees, and CE has length 25. Need to find BD.

Let me sketch mentally. Since CE is perpendicular to AB, that means CE is an altitude from C to AB? Wait, but E is on AB because PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,B)). So CE is perpendicular to AB, making triangle CEB a right triangle at E? But angle CBE is given as 73 degrees. Hmm. Also, angle CAE is 61 degrees, which would be part of triangle CAE. Also, since CE is perpendicular to AB, angle AEC is 90 degrees, as stated by RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C)).

So, in triangle AEC, angle at E is 90°, angle at A is 61°, so angle at C would be 180 - 90 -61 = 29 degrees. So angle ACE is 29 degrees. Similarly, looking at triangle CBE, since CE is perpendicular to AB, angle at E is also 90°, but angle CBE is 73°, so angle at C in triangle CBE would be 180 - 90 -73 = 17 degrees. Wait, but angle at C here is angle BCE?

Wait, maybe I should consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points could help. Let me try that.

Since CE is perpendicular to AB, and E is on AB. Let me set coordinate system with AB as x-axis. Let me assign coordinates such that point A is at (0,0) and point B is at (b, 0) for some b. Then, since CE is perpendicular to AB, CE is vertical if AB is horizontal. But where is point C? Since CE connects to E, which is on AB. Let me denote E as (e, 0). Then CE is vertical, so point C has coordinates (e, k) for some k. Because CE is vertical, so from E(e,0) up to C(e,k).

But also, there's another condition: AD is perpendicular to BC. And D lies on BC and AD. Also, PointD lies on Line(B,C) and Line(A,D). So AD intersects BC at D.

Also, Triangle ABC is formed by AB, BC, CA. Given that, and other triangles.

Additionally, there's a right angle at Angle(B,D,A), meaning that angle at D between B, D, A is a right angle. So BD is perpendicular to DA? Wait, Angle(B,D,A) is the angle at D, so it's angle between BD and DA. So that implies BD is perpendicular to DA. Therefore, DA is perpendicular to BC, as given by Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)). Wait, yes, the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)), so AD is perpendicular to BC.

Therefore, AD is perpendicular to BC, and BD is perpendicular to DA (since angle at D is right). So BD is perpendicular to DA, which is itself perpendicular to BC. Hence, BD is parallel to BC? Wait, no. If DA is perpendicular to BC, and BD is perpendicular to DA, then BD is parallel to BC? Because if two lines are each perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. Wait, but DA is perpendicular to BC, and BD is perpendicular to DA. So BD is parallel to BC? No, wait. If DA ⊥ BC, then BD ⊥ DA implies BD is parallel to BC? Wait, if DA is perpendicular to BC, then direction of DA is same as direction of BC's normal. Then BD being perpendicular to DA would mean BD is parallel to BC? Not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps coordinates can clarify. Let me proceed with coordinates.

Set coordinate system: Let me take AB as x-axis. Let me assign coordinates:

Let’s fix point A at (0,0). Let’s assume AB is along x-axis. Let’s say point B is at (c, 0). Then E is somewhere on AB, so E is (e, 0). Since CE is perpendicular to AB, CE is vertical, so point C is (e, h) for some h. Then CE has length sqrt( (e - e)^2 + (h - 0)^2 ) = |h| = 25. So h = 25 or -25. Assuming upwards, h = 25. So C is (e, 25).

Now, triangle ABC has points A(0,0), B(c,0), C(e,25). Now, we have angle CAE = 61°, which is the angle at A between CA and AE. Since AE is along AB from A(0,0) to E(e,0). Vector AE is (e,0). Vector AC is from A(0,0) to C(e,25): (e,25). So angle between vectors AE and AC is 61°.

We can compute this angle using dot product. The angle θ between vectors AE and AC is given by:

cosθ = (AE · AC)/(|AE||AC|)

Compute AE · AC = (e)(e) + (0)(25) = e²

|AE| = sqrt(e² + 0) = |e|

|AC| = sqrt(e² + 25²)

Thus,

cos(61°) = e² / ( |e| * sqrt(e² + 625) )

Assuming e > 0 (since E is between A and B?), but not sure yet. Let me suppose e > 0. Then |e| = e. Thus:

cos(61°) = e / sqrt(e² + 625)

Square both sides:

cos²(61°) = e² / (e² + 625)

Multiply denominator:

cos²(61°)(e² + 625) = e²

Expand:

cos²(61°)*e² + cos²(61°)*625 = e²

Bring terms with e² to left:

cos²(61°)*e² - e² = -cos²(61°)*625

Factor e²:

e² [cos²(61°) - 1] = -cos²(61°)*625

Note that cos²θ - 1 = -sin²θ, so:

e² (-sin²(61°)) = -cos²(61°)*625

Multiply both sides by -1:

e² sin²(61°) = cos²(61°) * 625

Divide both sides by sin²(61°):

e² = [cos²(61°)/sin²(61°)] * 625 = cot²(61°) * 625

Take square root:

e = cot(61°) * 25

Calculate cot(61°): cot(61°) = 1/tan(61°). Let me compute tan(61°). Using calculator, tan(60°)=√3≈1.732, tan(61°) ≈ 1.8040. So cot(61°) ≈ 1/1.804 ≈ 0.5543. So e ≈ 0.5543 * 25 ≈ 13.8575. So approximately 13.86 units.

So e ≈ 13.86. Therefore, coordinates of E are (13.86, 0), and C is (13.86, 25).

Now, need to find coordinates of D. Remember that D lies on BC and on AD, and AD is perpendicular to BC. Also, there's a right angle at D between B, D, A (Angle(B,D,A) is right angle). So BD is perpendicular to DA. Wait, earlier we had AD is perpendicular to BC, and BD is perpendicular to DA. So BD is perpendicular to DA, which is already perpendicular to BC. So BD is parallel to BC? Wait, if AD ⊥ BC, and BD ⊥ AD, then BD is parallel to BC? Because if two lines are each perpendicular to the same line, they are parallel. Wait, but AD is perpendicular to BC, and BD is perpendicular to AD. So BD is parallel to BC? That would imply that BD || BC, but since D is on BC, how can BD be parallel to BC? Unless BD is zero length? Wait, that seems contradictory. Maybe my assumption is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine.

AD is perpendicular to BC. BD is perpendicular to DA. So DA is perpendicular to BC, and BD is perpendicular to DA. So BD is parallel to BC? Because if DA is perpendicular to BC, then BD being perpendicular to DA would make BD parallel to BC. However, D lies on BC. So if BD is parallel to BC, then BD would have to be a segment of BC, but since D is on BC, BD is just a part of BC. Wait, but BD can't be parallel to BC unless BD is zero vector. This suggests a contradiction. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the perpendicularity. Let me check the original predicates. It says Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)), which means AD ⊥ BC. And RightAngle(Angle(B,D,A)), which means that at point D, the angle between BD and DA is 90 degrees. So BD ⊥ DA. Therefore, BD is perpendicular to DA, which is itself perpendicular to BC. Therefore, BD is parallel to BC. But BD is a segment starting at B and ending at D on BC. How can BD be parallel to BC? Only if D coincides with B, but that would make BD zero length. Contradiction. Therefore, something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe my coordinate setup is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps D is not between B and C, but extended beyond? Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(B,C)), so D is on line BC, but not necessarily between B and C. So BD could be extending beyond C or before B. But then BD would be parallel to BC? Wait, if BD is parallel to BC, then since BC is a straight line, BD would lie along BC. Which would mean that D is on BC, so BD is a subset of BC. So BD is part of BC. But then BD is parallel to BC? Well, technically, BD is a part of BC, so they are colinear. But parallelism usually refers to non-intersecting lines. So maybe the conclusion is that BD is colinear with BC, hence BD is along BC. But then BD is just a segment of BC. However, since AD is perpendicular to BC, and D is on BC, then AD is the altitude from A to BC? Wait, but in our case, AD is perpendicular to BC, so D is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. Wait, but earlier, we have E as the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB. So perhaps D is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. Let me check.

Yes! Because AD is perpendicular to BC, so D is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. So BD is the segment from B to D, where D is the foot of perpendicular from A onto BC. But then, why does the problem mention BD as needing to be found? Because maybe there are more relations.

But also, there's another condition: PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(A,D)). Wait, that's redundant, since D is on AD. Also, IntersectAt(Line(A,D), Line(B,C), Line(B,D), Point(D)). So the intersection of AD and BC is D. So D is the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. Therefore, BD is the distance from B to the foot of the perpendicular from A to BC. But how do we calculate that?

To find BD, we can use coordinates. We have coordinates for A(0,0), B(c,0), C(e,25), and D is the foot of perpendicular from A to BC.

So first, find equation of line BC. Coordinates of B(c,0) and C(e,25). Let me write parametric equations or find slope.

Slope of BC: m_BC = (25 - 0)/(e - c) = 25/(e - c). So equation of BC: y - 0 = [25/(e - c)](x - c).

Then, the foot of perpendicular from A(0,0) to BC is D. To find coordinates of D, we can use projection formula.

Alternatively, since AD is perpendicular to BC, so the line AD has slope negative reciprocal of m_BC. Slope of AD is -(e - c)/25.

Equation of AD: passes through A(0,0), so y = [-(e - c)/25]x.

Intersection point D is where these two lines meet: BC and AD.

Equation of BC: y = [25/(e - c)](x - c)

Equation of AD: y = [-(e - c)/25]x

Set equal:

[25/(e - c)](x - c) = [-(e - c)/25]x

Multiply both sides by 25(e - c) to eliminate denominators:

25*25(x - c) = -(e - c)^2 x

Which simplifies to:

625(x - c) = - (e - c)^2 x

Expanding:

625x - 625c = - (e^2 - 2ec + c^2)x

Bring all terms to left:

625x - 625c + (e^2 - 2ec + c^2)x = 0

Combine like terms:

[625 + e^2 - 2ec + c^2]x - 625c = 0

Solve for x:

x = [625c] / [625 + e^2 - 2ec + c^2]

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Let me recall that in coordinate geometry, the foot of the perpendicular from a point to a line can be found via formula.

Given line BC: ax + by + c = 0, and point (x0,y0), the foot D can be computed. But perhaps it's easier with vectors.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates for A, B, C, and we know e from earlier, maybe we can substitute values.

Earlier, we found e ≈ 13.86. But we need to relate variables. Wait, we also have angle CBE = 73 degrees. Let me see.

Point B is at (c,0), point E is at (e,0), point C is at (e,25). So BE is the segment from B(c,0) to E(e,0). Wait, but E is on AB, which is from A(0,0) to B(c,0). So if E is between A and B, then e is between 0 and c. Or if E is extended beyond B, then e > c. But earlier calculation gave e ≈ 13.86, assuming AB is longer than that. But we don't know c yet.

But we also have angle CBE = 73 degrees. Let me analyze triangle CBE. In triangle CBE, angle at B is 73 degrees, right angle at E (since CE is perpendicular to AB). Therefore, triangle CBE is right-angled at E, with angle at B being 73 degrees, so angle at C is 180 - 90 -73 = 17 degrees.

Using trigonometry in triangle CBE: tan(angle at B) = opposite/adjacent = CE / BE. So tan(73°) = CE / BE → BE = CE / tan(73°). CE is 25, so BE = 25 / tan(73°). Compute tan(73°): approx 3.2709. So BE ≈ 25 / 3.2709 ≈ 7.64.

Since BE is the length from B to E. Since E is on AB, which goes from A(0,0) to B(c,0). So BE = |c - e|. Assuming E is between A and B, then e < c, so BE = c - e. Therefore:

c - e = BE ≈ 7.64 → c = e + 7.64.

Earlier, we found e ≈ 13.86. Therefore, c ≈ 13.86 + 7.64 ≈ 21.5.

So c ≈ 21.5, e ≈ 13.86.

Now, with these values, we can find coordinates of B as (21.5, 0), E as (13.86, 0), C as (13.86, 25).

Now, need to find D, the foot of perpendicular from A(0,0) to BC.

Coordinates of B: (21.5, 0), C: (13.86, 25). Let me calculate the equation of BC.

Slope of BC: m = (25 - 0)/(13.86 - 21.5) = 25 / (-7.64) ≈ -3.2709. Which matches tan(73°) because earlier BE was 7.64 and CE=25, giving tan(theta)=CE/BE=25/7.64≈3.2709, which corresponds to angle at B being 73°, so slope of BC is negative of that, which is -tan(73°) ≈ -3.2709.

So equation of BC: passing through B(21.5, 0), slope m ≈ -3.2709.

Equation: y - 0 = m(x - 21.5) → y = -3.2709(x - 21.5)

Equation of AD: perpendicular to BC, so slope is reciprocal positive: 1/3.2709 ≈ 0.3057. Since it passes through A(0,0), equation is y = 0.3057x.

Find intersection D between BC and AD.

Set y = -3.2709(x - 21.5) and y = 0.3057x.

So:

0.3057x = -3.2709(x - 21.5)

Expand RHS: -3.2709x + 3.2709 * 21.5

Bring all terms to left:

0.3057x + 3.2709x = 3.2709 * 21.5

Total coefficient for x: 0.3057 + 3.2709 ≈ 3.5766

Thus:

3.5766x = 3.2709 * 21.5

Compute RHS: 3.2709 * 21.5 ≈ 3.2709 * 20 + 3.2709 * 1.5 ≈ 65.418 + 4.906 ≈ 70.324

So x ≈ 70.324 / 3.5766 ≈ 19.66

Then y = 0.3057 * 19.66 ≈ 5.996 ≈ 6.0.

So coordinates of D are approximately (19.66, 6.0). Now, BD is the distance from B(21.5, 0) to D(19.66, 6.0).

Compute BD: sqrt[(21.5 - 19.66)^2 + (0 - 6.0)^2] = sqrt[(1.84)^2 + (-6)^2] ≈ sqrt(3.3856 + 36) = sqrt(39.3856) ≈ 6.276. Rounded to one decimal place, that's 6.3.

But wait, let me verify calculations more accurately, since approximations may have introduced errors.

Let me recalculate with more precise numbers.

First, let me get exact expressions instead of approximate decimals.

Starting over with symbols:

From earlier steps:

We had e = 25 * cot(61°), and BE = 25 / tan(73°). Let me express these symbolically.

Let me define:

Let’s denote angle at A (CAE) as α = 61°, angle at B (CBE) as β = 73°, CE = 25.

For triangle AEC, right-angled at E: tan(α) = CE / AE → AE = CE / tan(α) = 25 / tan(61°)

Similarly, in triangle CBE, right-angled at E: tan(β) = CE / BE → BE = CE / tan(β) = 25 / tan(73°)

Therefore, AE = 25 / tan(61°), BE = 25 / tan(73°)

Since AB = AE + EB (assuming E is between A and B), so AB = AE + BE = 25 [1/tan(61°) + 1/tan(73°)]

But AB is also the distance between A(0,0) and B(c,0), which is c. So c = AB = 25 [cot(61°) + cot(73°)].

Once we have AB = c, and AE = 25 / tan(61°), then coordinates of E are at AE distance from A, so e = AE = 25 / tan(61°). Then BE = c - e = 25 / tan(73°), so c = e + 25 / tan(73°).

But regardless, we need to find BD, which is the length from B to the foot of perpendicular from A to BC.

Alternatively, using coordinate geometry with symbolic expressions.

Let me find coordinates of D, which is foot of perpendicular from A(0,0) to BC.

Coordinates of B: (c, 0), C: (e, 25). So vector BC is (e - c, 25). Parametric equation of BC: any point on BC can be written as B + t*(vector BC) = (c + t(e - c), 0 + t*25), where t ∈ R.

The foot D is the projection of A onto BC. The formula for projection scalar t is:

t = [(A - B) · (C - B)] / |BC|²

Vector A - B is (-c, 0). Vector C - B is (e - c, 25). Their dot product is (-c)(e - c) + 0*25 = -c(e - c) = c(c - e).

|BC|² = (e - c)^2 + 25^2.

Thus, t = [c(c - e)] / [(e - c)^2 + 625] = [-c(e - c)] / [(e - c)^2 + 625] = [ -c(e - c) ] / [ (e - c)^2 + 625 ]

Then coordinates of D are:

x = c + t*(e - c) = c + [ -c(e - c) / ((e - c)^2 + 625) ]*(e - c) = c - c(e - c)^2 / [ (e - c)^2 + 625 ]

y = 0 + t*25 = [ -c(e - c) * 25 ] / [ (e - c)^2 + 625 ]

But this seems complex. Perhaps substituting values for e and c.

Recall that e = 25 / tan(61°), and c = e + 25 / tan(73°). Let me compute these values numerically with higher precision.

First, compute tan(61°):

Using calculator, tan(61°) ≈ 1.80405

So e = 25 / 1.80405 ≈ 13.857

tan(73°) ≈ 3.27085

So BE = 25 / 3.27085 ≈ 7.64

Thus, c = e + BE ≈ 13.857 + 7.64 ≈ 21.497 ≈ 21.5

So c ≈ 21.5, e ≈ 13.857

Now, compute e - c ≈ 13.857 - 21.5 ≈ -7.643

Let me denote delta = e - c = -7.643

Then, |BC|² = delta² + 25² = (-7.643)^2 + 625 ≈ 58.4 + 625 = 683.4

Then t = [ -c * delta ] / (delta² + 625 )

Plugging in:

-c = -21.5

delta = -7.643

Numerator: -c * delta = -21.5 * (-7.643) = 21.5 * 7.643 ≈ 21.5 * 7.643

Compute 20 * 7.643 = 152.86, 1.5 * 7.643 ≈ 11.4645 → total ≈ 164.3245

Denominator: 683.4

So t ≈ 164.3245 / 683.4 ≈ 0.2405

Then coordinates of D:

x = c + t * delta = 21.5 + 0.2405*(-7.643) ≈ 21.5 - 1.837 ≈ 19.663

y = t * 25 ≈ 0.2405 * 25 ≈ 6.0125

So D ≈ (19.663, 6.0125)

Now, BD is the distance from B(21.5, 0) to D(19.663, 6.0125):

Δx = 21.5 - 19.663 = 1.837

Δy = 0 - 6.0125 = -6.0125

BD = sqrt( (1.837)^2 + (6.0125)^2 )

Calculate:

(1.837)^2 ≈ 3.375

(6.0125)^2 ≈ 36.15

Sum ≈ 3.375 + 36.15 = 39.525

sqrt(39.525) ≈ 6.287

Rounded to one decimal place: 6.3

But let me check if there's a more accurate method without relying on approximate values.

Alternative approach: Using coordinates, once we have c and e, we can compute BD using projections.

Alternatively, since AD is the altitude from A to BC, BD is the segment from B to D. In triangle ABC, the length of the altitude from A to BC is given by area / (0.5 * BC). But we need BD, which is a portion of BC.

Alternatively, using coordinates, once we have coordinates of D, compute BD.

But since we've done that numerically and got approximately 6.3, but need to confirm if this is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check with more accurate calculations.

Let me recalculate t with more precision.

First, compute delta = e - c = -7.643 (approximate)

c = 21.5

So numerator: -c * delta = -21.5 * (-7.643) = 21.5 * 7.643

Let me calculate 21.5 * 7.643:

Breakdown:

20 * 7.643 = 152.86

1.5 * 7.643 = 11.4645

Total: 152.86 + 11.4645 = 164.3245

Denominator: delta² + 625 = (-7.643)^2 + 625 = 58.4 + 625 = 683.4 (exact?)

Wait, (-7.643)^2 = 7.643^2. Let me compute 7.643 squared precisely.

7.643^2 = ?

Well, 7.6^2 = 57.76, 0.043^2 = ~0.0018, cross term 2*7.6*0.043 = 0.6568

So total approx 57.76 + 0.6568 + 0.0018 ≈ 58.4186. So delta² ≈ 58.4186

Thus denominator is 58.4186 + 625 = 683.4186

So t = 164.3245 / 683.4186 ≈ 0.2405 (as before)

Thus, x-coordinate of D: c + t * delta = 21.5 + 0.2405 * (-7.643) ≈ 21.5 - 0.2405 * 7.643

Calculate 0.2405 * 7.643:

Approximately 0.24 * 7.643 = 1.834, plus 0.0005 * 7.643 ≈ 0.0038, total ≈ 1.8378

So x ≈ 21.5 - 1.8378 = 19.6622

y = t * 25 ≈ 0.2405 * 25 = 6.0125

Now, BD: distance from B(21.5, 0) to D(19.6622, 6.0125)

dx = 21.5 - 19.6622 = 1.8378

dy = 0 - 6.0125 = -6.0125

BD^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 = (1.8378)^2 + (6.0125)^2

Calculate:

1.8378^2: Let's compute 1.8378^2. Let me note that (1.8378)^2 ≈ (1.8)^2 + 2*1.8*0.0378 + (0.0378)^2 ≈ 3.24 + 0.136 + 0.0014 ≈ 3.3774

(6.0125)^2: Let's compute 6.0125^2. Note that (6 + 0.0125)^2 = 36 + 2*6*0.0125 + (0.0125)^2 = 36 + 0.15 + 0.000156 ≈ 36.150156

So BD^2 ≈ 3.3774 + 36.150156 ≈ 39.527556

Therefore, BD ≈ sqrt(39.527556) ≈ 6.287, which rounds to 6.3 when rounded to one decimal place.

But let me check if there's a more exact analytical method without resorting to numerical approximations.

Let me consider using trigonometry in triangle ABD or other triangles.

Wait, since AD is perpendicular to BC, and we know coordinates or relations between segments.

Alternatively, using the formula for the length of the projection.

But perhaps using areas. Let me think.

Area of triangle ABC can be computed in two ways: one using base AB and height CE, and another using base BC and height AD.

Wait, CE is the altitude from C to AB, which we know is 25. So area of ABC is 0.5 * AB * CE = 0.5 * AB * 25.

Also, area is 0.5 * BC * AD.

But we need to find AD, but we're interested in BD. However, perhaps relating BD to other parts.

Alternatively, using coordinates, once we have AB, BC, etc., we can find BD.

But since we've already arrived at approximately 6.3, and the options were not provided, but the user said to choose from A-D. However, the initial message said "No choices found" but the assistant needs to provide an answer. However, in the absence of actual choices, based on calculation, BD ≈ 6.3. But perhaps there is an exact value.

Wait, let me try to compute analytically.

From earlier, we have:

BD^2 = (c - x_D)^2 + y_D^2, where D is the foot of perpendicular.

But alternatively, since D lies on BC, and BD is the segment from B to D, we can find BD using the ratio of segments.

In general, the length of the projection of AB onto BC gives us something... Wait, perhaps using the formula for the foot of the perpendicular.

Alternatively, since we have coordinates expressions:

We can express BD as follows:

In triangle ABC, with coordinates as above, BD can be expressed in terms of c and e.

But this seems too vague. Alternatively, considering that in triangle ABC, AD is the altitude from A to BC. The length of AD can be calculated as:

AD = (2 * Area of ABC) / BC

But we can compute Area of ABC as 0.5 * AB * CE = 0.5 * AB * 25.

AB is c = AE + BE = 25 / tan(61°) + 25 / tan(73°).

Let me compute AB:

AB = 25 [1/tan(61°) + 1/tan(73°)] = 25 [cot(61°) + cot(73°)].

So Area ABC = 0.5 * AB * 25 = 0.5 * 25 * AB = 12.5 * AB.

Then, AD = (2 * Area) / BC = (2 * 12.5 * AB) / BC = 25 * AB / BC.

But BC length is sqrt( (e - c)^2 + 25^2 ). Earlier, we had delta = e - c = -BE = -25 / tan(73°). So delta = -25 / tan(73°). Therefore:

BC = sqrt(delta^2 + 25^2) = sqrt( (25/tan(73°))^2 + 25^2 ) = 25 * sqrt( 1/tan²(73°) + 1 ) = 25 * sqrt( (1 + tan²(73°))/tan²(73°) )) = 25 * sec(73°) / tan(73°) = 25 / sin(73°).

Because sec(θ)/tan(θ) = 1/sin(θ).

Thus, BC = 25 / sin(73°).

Now, AD = 25 * AB / BC = 25 * [25 (cot(61°) + cot(73°))] / [25 / sin(73°)] = 25 * [cot(61°) + cot(73°)] * sin(73°).

But this expression seems complex. Let me simplify:

AD = 25 * [cot(61°) + cot(73°)] * sin(73°)

cot(θ) = cos(θ)/sin(θ), so:

AD = 25 [ cos(61°)/sin(61°) + cos(73°)/sin(73°) ] * sin(73°)

= 25 [ cos(61°) * sin(73°)/sin(61°) + cos(73°) ]

This still seems complicated, but perhaps we can evaluate numerically:

Compute each term:

First, compute cos(61°) and sin(61°), sin(73°), cos(73°).

Using calculator:

cos(61°) ≈ 0.4848

sin(61°) ≈ 0.8746

sin(73°) ≈ 0.9563

cos(73°) ≈ 0.2924

So:

Term1: cos(61°)*sin(73°)/sin(61°) = (0.4848 * 0.9563) / 0.8746 ≈ (0.4635) / 0.8746 ≈ 0.530

Term2: cos(73°) = 0.2924

Sum: 0.530 + 0.2924 ≈ 0.8224

Thus, AD ≈ 25 * 0.8224 ≈ 20.56

But this is the length of AD, not BD. However, we need BD.

But BD is part of BC. Since AD is the altitude, and in triangle ABC, the feet of the altitude divides BC into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

Wait, there's a formula for the length of the segments created by the foot of the altitude. Specifically, if D is the foot of the altitude from A to BC, then BD = (AB² - AC² + BC²) / (2 * BC). Wait, no, that's for other cases. Alternatively, using the Pythagorean theorem.

In triangle ABD and ADC:

AB² = AD² + BD²

AC² = AD² + CD²

And BC = BD + DC.

But we know AB, AC, AD, and BC.

Wait, we can compute AB, AC, BC.

AB = c = 25[cot(61°) + cot(73°)] ≈ 25[0.5543 + 0.2924] ≈ 25[0.8467] ≈ 21.1675

Wait earlier estimate was c ≈ 21.5, close enough.

AC is the distance from A(0,0) to C(e,25): sqrt(e² + 25²). With e = 25 / tan(61°) ≈ 25 / 1.804 ≈ 13.857, so AC ≈ sqrt(13.857² + 25²) ≈ sqrt(192.0 + 625) ≈ sqrt(817) ≈ 28.58

AD we calculated as ≈20.56

So AB² = 21.1675² ≈ 448.0

AD² ≈ 20.56² ≈ 422.7

BD² = AB² - AD² ≈ 448 - 422.7 ≈ 25.3 → BD ≈ 5.03

Wait, this contradicts the previous calculation of ≈6.3. What's wrong here?

Ah, because this assumes that AB² = AD² + BD², which is true only if angle at D is right angle. But in this case, AD is the altitude, so yes, triangle ABD is right-angled at D. So BD² = AB² - AD². But according to this, BD ≈ sqrt(448 - 422.7) ≈ sqrt(25.3) ≈ 5.03, conflicting with prior calculation of ≈6.3. This inconsistency indicates an error in assumptions.

Where is the mistake?

Let me recheck calculations:

If AD is the altitude from A to BC, then yes, in triangle ABD, right-angled at D, so AB² = AD² + BD². But earlier calculation using coordinates gave BD ≈6.3, while this method gives ≈5.03. Clearly, there's a mistake in one of the methods.

Let me recalculate AB, AD, and BD.

First, AB is c ≈21.5.

AD is calculated as 25 * [cot(61°) + cot(73°)] * sin(73°). Earlier approximation gave AD ≈20.56.

But let's compute AB² and AD²:

AB² = (21.5)^2 = 462.25

AD² = (20.56)^2 ≈ 422.7

BD² = AB² - AD² ≈ 462.25 - 422.7 ≈ 39.55 → BD ≈6.29, which aligns with the coordinate calculation of ≈6.287. Ah, earlier I mistakenly wrote AB² as 448.0, but actually AB is ≈21.5, so AB² is 462.25. My earlier mistake was due to incorrect AB value. So BD ≈ sqrt(39.55) ≈6.29, confirming the coordinate calculation.

So this confirms that BD is approximately 6.3 when rounded to one decimal place.

Hence, the answer should be 6.3. But since the original problem didn't provide choices, and the instruction says to select from A-D, but the user mentioned "No choices found," perhaps there's a mistake. But assuming the answer is 6.3, and if the options included it, the correct choice would be the corresponding letter. However, since no choices are provided, I'll conclude with the calculated value.
