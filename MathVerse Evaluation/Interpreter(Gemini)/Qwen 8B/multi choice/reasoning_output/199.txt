====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given information and figure out how the different elements relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the given predicates and see what they tell us.

We have points O, C, B, D, X. There's a circle with center O. Points C, B, D lie on this circle, so OC, OB, OD are radii. Since all radii of a circle are equal, OC = OB = OD = 13 inches, as given. 

There's a chord CD which is 24 inches long. The line CD is a chord of the circle, and line OB is a radius that's perpendicular to CD at point X. Also, it's mentioned that line OB intersects CD at point X, and that X is the midpoint of CD because it's stated that X is the midpoint. Wait, but there's also a predicate saying IsMidpointOf(Point(X), Line(C,D)), so yes, X is the midpoint of CD. That means CX = XD = 12 inches since CD is 24.

Now, since OB is perpendicular to CD at its midpoint X, this setup suggests that OB is the perpendicular bisector of chord CD. In circle geometry, the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord and creates a right triangle. So, triangle OXC should be a right triangle where angle at X is the right angle. 

Given that, we can use the Pythagorean theorem here. We know OC is the hypotenuse of triangle OXC, which is 13 inches. CX is one leg, which is half of CD, so 12 inches. Then, we can find OX, which would be the other leg. 

So applying Pythagoras: (OX)^2 + (CX)^2 = (OC)^2. Plugging in the numbers: (OX)^2 + 12^2 = 13^2 → OX² = 169 - 144 = 25 → OX = 5 inches. Therefore, the answer should be 5, which corresponds to choice A. 

Wait, let me double-check. The problem says that OB is perpendicular to CD at X, making OX part of the radius OB. But since X is the midpoint of CD, and OB is perpendicular to CD, then OX is indeed the distance from the center to the chord. The formula for the distance from the center to a chord is d = √(r² - (c/2)²), where c is the chord length. Here, r=13, c=24, so c/2=12. Thus, d = √(169 - 144) = √25 = 5. Yep, that confirms OX is 5. So the correct answer is A.
