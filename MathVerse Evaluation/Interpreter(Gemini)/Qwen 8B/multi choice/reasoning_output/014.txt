MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle O. The given information includes that angle OAB is 35 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle ACB. 

First, I should recall some circle theorems. Since ABC is inscribed in circle O, points A, B, and C lie on the circumference of the circle. That means OA, OB, and OC are radii of the circle because O is the center. Wait, the predicates mention that O is the center since there's a Circle(O) and Line(O,A), Line(O,B), etc., which are radii. Also, it says IsRadiusOf(Line(O,A), Circle(O)), so OA, OB, and OC are all radii. Therefore, OA = OB = OC. 

Given that OA and OB are radii, triangle OAB is isosceles with OA = OB. The angle at OAB is given as 35 degrees. Wait, angle OAB is at point A between points O and B. Let me visualize this. Point O is the center, and points A and B are on the circle. So OA and AB are sides of triangle OAB. Wait, but angle OAB is at vertex A, so it's the angle between OA and AB. But OA is a radius, and AB is a chord of the circle. 

Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. Triangle OAB has two sides OA and OB as radii, making it an isosceles triangle with OA=OB. The angle at A (OAB) is 35 degrees. In such a case, the base angles would be at A and B? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle OAB, the two equal sides are OA and OB. Therefore, the base is AB, and the two equal sides are OA and OB. Therefore, the base angles would be at A and B. Wait, but angle OAB is at A. So if triangle OAB is isosceles with OA=OB, then angles at A and B are equal. Wait, but angle OAB is one of those base angles. Wait, but wait—maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again.

In triangle OAB, OA and OB are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite these sides should be equal. Wait, OA is adjacent to angle at B, and OB is adjacent to angle at A. Wait, perhaps I need to label the triangle properly. Let me consider triangle OAB with vertices O, A, B. The sides OA and OB are equal. Therefore, the angles opposite them would be angles at B and A respectively. Wait, side OA is opposite angle at B, and side OB is opposite angle at A. Since OA=OB, then angle at B equals angle at A. Therefore, in triangle OAB, angles at A and B are equal. But the given angle is OAB, which is angle at A, so angle OAB is equal to angle OBA. 

But wait, angle OAB is given as 35 degrees. Therefore, angle OBA is also 35 degrees. Then the third angle at O in triangle OAB would be 180 - 2*35 = 110 degrees. So angle AOB is 110 degrees. 

Now, since points A, B, and C are on the circle centered at O, then OA, OB, and OC are all radii. Therefore, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle. Now, angle ACB is an inscribed angle. The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So angle ACB intercepts arc AB. Wait, but angle at C intercepts arc AB. However, angle AOB is the central angle intercepting the same arc AB. Therefore, the measure of arc AB is equal to the central angle, which is 110 degrees. Therefore, the inscribed angle ACB would be half of that, so 55 degrees. 

Therefore, the measure of angle ACB is 55 degrees, which corresponds to answer choice B. 

Let me check again. Angle at the center is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc. So yes, arc AB is 110 degrees, so angle ACB is half of that, 55 degrees. That seems correct. So answer is B.
