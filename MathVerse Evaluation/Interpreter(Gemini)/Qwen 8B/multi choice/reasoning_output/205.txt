MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right triangle with angles 30°, 60°, and 90°, right? The hypotenuse is x, and the other sides are y and 21. We need to find the value of y. 

First, I remember that in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in a specific ratio. The side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest one, then the side opposite 60°, and the hypotenuse is twice the shortest side. Wait, but here the hypotenuse is given as x. Let me think.

Wait, the problem says the hypotenuse is x, and the other sides are y and 21. But wait, in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side. So if 21 is one of the legs, then either y or 21 could be the shorter leg. But since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. So the side opposite 30° is the shortest, then the other leg is √3 times that, and the hypotenuse is twice the shortest side.

So first, I need to figure out which side corresponds to which angle. Since the angles are 30°, 60°, and 90°, the hypotenuse is opposite the 90° angle. Therefore, the sides adjacent to the 30° and 60° angles are the legs. 

Let me assign variables. Let's say the side opposite the 30° angle is the shorter leg. Then that would be y or 21. Suppose the hypotenuse is x. Then according to the ratios:

Shorter leg (opposite 30°) = x / 2.

Longer leg (opposite 60°) = (x√3)/2.

But wait, in our case, the given sides are y and 21. Which one is which? Hmm. Let's consider possibilities.

Case 1: Suppose the side 21 is the longer leg (opposite 60°). Then the shorter leg would be 21 / √3, and the hypotenuse would be 2*(21 / √3) = 14√3. But then the hypotenuse would be x = 14√3. However, the problem states that the hypotenuse is x, so maybe that's not directly helpful unless we know more.

Alternatively, Case 2: Suppose 21 is the shorter leg (opposite 30°). Then the longer leg would be 21√3, and the hypotenuse would be 2*21 = 42. In this case, the hypotenuse x would be 42, and the other leg y would be 21√3. Wait, but the problem says the other sides are y and 21. So if 21 is the shorter leg, then y would be the longer leg, which is 21√3. That would make sense.

But how do we know which case applies? Because the problem doesn't specify which side is which. Wait, the problem says that the hypotenuse is x, and the other sides are y and 21. So the hypotenuse is x, and the other two sides are y and 21. So in this scenario, the hypotenuse is x, and the legs are y and 21. Therefore, we need to find y based on the given angles.

Since it's a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Let's assume that the side opposite 30° is the shorter leg, and the side opposite 60° is the longer leg. The hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg.

Now, depending on whether 21 is the shorter leg or the longer leg, we get different results. So we need to figure out which one it is. Wait, but perhaps there's another way. Let's use trigonometry. For example, in a right triangle, sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse.

If the angles are 30°, 60°, and 90°, then for the 30° angle, the opposite side is the shorter leg. Let's suppose that the side opposite 30° is 21. Then, sin(30°) = 21 / x. Since sin(30°) is 1/2, so 1/2 = 21/x → x = 42. Then the other leg (opposite 60°) would be sqrt(x² - 21²) = sqrt(42² - 21²) = sqrt((42-21)(42+21)) = sqrt(21*63) = sqrt(1323) = 21*sqrt(3). Alternatively, using the ratio, if the shorter leg is 21, then longer leg is 21√3, hypotenuse is 42. So in this case, the other leg y is 21√3. But looking at the answer choices, option C is 21√3, which would be y. 

Alternatively, if 21 was the longer leg, then the shorter leg would be 21 / √3, and hypotenuse would be 2*(21 / √3) = 14√3. Then the other leg (shorter) would be 21 / √3, but that would mean y is 21 / √3, which is approximately 12.12, but none of the options match that. So that suggests that the correct case is where 21 is the shorter leg, making y = 21√3. Hence, answer C.

But wait, the problem states that the hypotenuse is x. So if the hypotenuse is x, then in this case, x = 42, and y = 21√3. So the answer would be C. Let me check again.

Another way: Using the properties of a 30-60-90 triangle. The sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. So the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. If the given side is 21, which is a leg, then depending on which leg it is. If it's the shorter leg, then hypotenuse is 42, and longer leg is 21√3. If it's the longer leg, then shorter leg is 21 / √3, hypotenuse is 42 / √3 * something? Wait, no. Let me rephrase.

Suppose the longer leg is 21. Then, since longer leg is √3 times the shorter leg. Let shorter leg = s. Then longer leg is s√3 = 21 → s = 21 / √3. Hypotenuse is 2s = 2*(21 / √3) = 42 / √3 = 14√3. But then, the hypotenuse is x = 14√3. However, the problem says that the hypotenuse is x, and the other sides are y and 21. So in this case, the other sides are y = 21 / √3 and 21. But 21 / √3 simplifies to 7√3. Which isn't among the answer choices. So that case is invalid because the answer choices don't include 7√3. Hence, the correct assumption is that 21 is the shorter leg. Thus, the longer leg y is 21√3, which is option C.

Therefore, the correct answer should be C.
