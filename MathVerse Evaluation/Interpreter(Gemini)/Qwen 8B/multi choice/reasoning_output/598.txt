MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about determining if a figure composed of two segments is the graph of a function using the vertical line test. The given predicates mention Shape(Curve1) and Shape(Curve2), and NOT(Function(Union(Curve1, Curve2))). 

First, I need to recall what the vertical line test entails. From what I remember, the vertical line test is used to determine if a graph represents a function. The idea is that if any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, then it's not a function because a function can have only one output (y-value) for each input (x-value). So, applying this test means checking for vertical intersections.

Now, the problem states there are two segments. Let me think—segments are straight lines between two points. If these two segments are part of the same vertical line, then combining them would form a single vertical line, which would definitely fail the vertical line test because every vertical line would intersect at infinitely many points. But wait, the problem says the union of Curve1 and Curve2 isn't a function. That suggests that the combined curves don't satisfy the function property. However, the question is specifically about whether the curve (the union of the two segments) is a function. 

Wait, but the given predicate says NOT(Function(Union(Curve1, Curve2))), so the union isn't a function. Therefore, the answer should be No, meaning the vertical line test would show that there's at least one vertical line intersecting the graph more than once. But how does that relate to the two segments?

Let me visualize two segments. Suppose they are arranged such that they share the same x-coordinate but different y-values. For example, imagine two horizontal segments stacked vertically. Wait, no—if they're horizontal, then a vertical line crossing them would intersect each segment once, but since they're separate, maybe not. Wait, no—if they are horizontal, then a vertical line could cross both segments if they are aligned horizontally. Wait, no—if they are horizontal, they have the same slope (zero), but different y-intercepts. Then a vertical line would intersect each horizontal segment once. But that would mean two intersection points on the same vertical line, making it not a function. So, if two horizontal segments are placed side by side horizontally, then yes, a vertical line passing through their x-coordinates would hit both segments. Wait, no—if they are horizontal, then their x-coordinates vary. Wait, perhaps the two segments are overlapping? Or maybe they cross each other? 

Alternatively, if the two segments are arranged vertically, like forming a 'V' shape. Wait, but two segments can form a V if they meet at a common point. In that case, the vertical line test would depend on where the vertical lines are drawn. For instance, if the two segments are symmetric around the y-axis, then a vertical line at x=0 would intersect only once. But if they cross each other, then depending on their arrangement, some vertical lines might intersect more than once. 

But the key here is that the union of the two segments isn't a function. The original problem gives that NOT(Function(Union(Curve1, Curve2))). So the union is not a function, which implies that there exists at least one vertical line that intersects the union at more than one point. Hence, the answer should be B (No), because the vertical line test fails. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
