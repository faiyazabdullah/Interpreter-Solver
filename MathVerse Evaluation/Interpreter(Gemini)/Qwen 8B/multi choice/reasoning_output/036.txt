Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and visualize the diagram they describe. 

So, we have points A, B, C, D, and O. Circle O is mentioned, so O is the center. Points A, B, C lie on the circle because PointLiesOnCircle(A,Circle(O)) and similarly for B and C. Line AB is the diameter since IsDiameterOf(Line(A,B),Circle(O)). That means AB passes through the center O, which is also confirmed by PointLiesOnLine(O,Line(A,B)). 

Then there's a tangent line CD at point C. The tangent line CD intersects the extended line AB at point D. Also, Line(C,D) is tangent to the circle, so CD touches the circle only at C. Since CD is tangent, the radius OC should be perpendicular to CD. The predicate says Perpendicular(Line(O,C),Line(C,D)), confirming that OC ⊥ CD.

We're told MeasureOf(Angle(D),50.0). Wait, Angle(D)? Hmm, maybe angle at D? Or angle D refers to some other angle. Let me check the predicates again. Oh, there's a RightAngle(Angle(O,C,D)) and MeasureOf(Angle(O,C,D),90.0). So angle OCD is 90 degrees. But angle D is mentioned as 50 degrees. Maybe angle ADC? Or angle at D formed by lines?

Wait, the problem states: "passing point C to draw the tangent of circle O and it intersects the extended line of AB at point D." So CD is the tangent line starting at C and intersecting the extension of AB at D. Therefore, D lies on the line AB extended beyond B or A? Depending on where C is located. Since AB is the diameter, and C is another point on the circle, so triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with AB as diameter. Then, angle ACB would be a right angle because an angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle. Wait, but here we have CD being tangent at C, so OC is perpendicular to CD. 

Now, considering triangle OCD: since OC is radius and CD is tangent, angle OCD is 90 degrees. Also, OA and OB are radii, so OA=OB=OC. Given that IsRadiusOf(Line(O,A),Circle(O)) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,A)),LengthOf(Line(O,C))), so OA=OC, making triangle AOC isosceles. Also, Triangle(A,O,C) is isosceles, which aligns with OA=OC. 

The measure of angle D is given as 50 degrees. Assuming angle D refers to angle ADC or angle at D. Wait, the problem says "angle D = 50.0", but angles are usually denoted by three letters. However, perhaps in the problem's context, angle D refers to angle ADC, which is at point D between points A and C. Alternatively, it could be angle between DC and DA. Let me think about how the points are arranged.

Since CD is tangent at C and meets AB extended at D, then D is outside the circle. The tangent CD creates a right angle with OC. Now, looking at triangle OCD, which has a right angle at C. Also, OA is a radius, and AB is the diameter. 

Let me try to find relations between angles. Since AB is the diameter, and C is on the circle, then angle ACB is 90 degrees. But wait, angle ACB isn't directly part of the current setup. However, connecting AC gives us triangle ACD. 

But the main focus is angle D, which is 50 degrees. Let's consider triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, angle at D is 50 degrees. We need to relate this to other angles. Since CD is tangent at C, and OC is perpendicular to CD, then OC is perpendicular to CD. Also, OA is a radius, so OA equals OC. 

Perhaps we can use power of a point. For point D outside the circle, the square of the tangent length DC equals DA * DB. Because DC² = DA * DB. 

Also, since AB is the diameter, if we let AB = 2r, then OA = OB = r. Let’s denote AB as 2r, so AO = OB = r. Let’s assume coordinates for easier calculation. Let me place the circle with center O at origin (0,0), and AB along x-axis. Let’s say A is (-r, 0), B is (r, 0). Point C is somewhere on the circle. Let’s choose coordinates for C such that angle at C satisfies the tangent condition. 

Since CD is tangent at C, and OC is perpendicular to CD. Suppose point C is at (x,y) on the circle, so x² + y² = r². The slope of OC is y/x, so the slope of CD, being perpendicular, is -x/y. The line CD passes through C and has slope -x/y. This line intersects AB (the x-axis) at point D. 

Parametrize line CD: starting at C(x,y), direction vector proportional to (y, -x). So parametric equations: x + ty, y - tx. To find intersection with AB (y=0). Set y - tx = 0 → t = y/x. Substituting back into x-coordinate: x + t*y = x + (y/x)*y = x + y²/x. Since x² + y² = r², y² = r² - x². Thus, x + (r² - x²)/x = x + r²/x - x = r²/x. Therefore, the x-coordinate of D is r²/x. So point D has coordinates (r²/x, 0). 

Therefore, DA is the distance from D to A, which is |r²/x - (-r)| = |r²/x + r|. Similarly, DB is |r²/x - r|. Since D is on the extension of AB, depending on the position of C. For example, if C is in the upper half, then x could be positive or negative. But assuming standard position, let's take C in the first quadrant, so x > 0. Then, r²/x would be positive. If x < r, then r²/x > r, so D is to the right of B. If x > r, then r²/x < r, but since x² ≤ r² (as C is on the circle), x cannot exceed r. Hence, x ≤ r, so r²/x ≥ r. Therefore, D is to the right of B. 

Thus, DA = r²/x + r, and DB = r²/x - r. By power of a point, DC² = DA * DB. Let's compute DC. Since DC is the tangent from D to the circle, its length squared is DC² = (distance from D to center)^2 - r^2. Coordinates of D are (r²/x, 0), center O is at (0,0). Distance OD is sqrt[(r²/x)^2 + 0] = r²/x. Thus, DC² = (OD)^2 - r^2 = (r^4)/(x²) - r² = r²(r²/x² - 1). 

On the other hand, DA * DB = [r²/x + r][r²/x - r] = (r²/x)^2 - r² = same as above. So that checks out. 

Now, returning to angles. The problem states that angle D is 50 degrees. Assuming angle at D, which is angle ADC. Let's look at triangle ADC. In triangle ADC, angle at D is 50 degrees. We need to find angle at A, which is angle DAC. 

Alternatively, maybe angle at D is angle between AD and CD. Let me confirm. Since D is on AB extended, and CD is tangent, angle ADC would be the angle between DC and DA. 

To find angle at D (angle ADC), we can use trigonometry or triangle properties. Let's consider triangle ADC. We know DC² = DA * DB from earlier, but how does that help with angles? Maybe using Law of Sines or Cosines. 

Alternatively, consider triangle OCD. It is a right triangle at C, with OC = r, CD = sqrt(OD² - r²) = sqrt((r²/x)^2 - r²) = r*sqrt(r²/x² - 1). 

Also, in triangle OCD, angle at C is 90 degrees, angle at O is something, angle at D is something. But how does this relate to angle ADC? 

Wait, angle ADC is part of triangle ADC, which includes point A, D, C. Let's see if we can relate angles in triangle ADC with other parts. 

Another approach: Since AB is diameter, and C is on the circle, then angle ACB is 90 degrees. But point D is outside the circle. Let me consider triangle ACD. 

Alternatively, since CD is tangent at C, then angle between CD and CA is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. That is, the angle between tangent CD and chord CA is equal to the angle subtended by CA in the alternate segment. 

In this case, the angle between CD and CA (which is angle ACD) should be equal to angle CAB. Because angle between tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

So angle ACD = angle CAB. 

Let me verify that. Yes, the Alternate Segment Theorem states that the angle between the tangent and chord at the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. Here, the tangent is CD and chord is CA, so angle between them is angle ACD, which equals angle CAB. 

So angle ACD = angle CAB. 

Let’s denote angle CAB as θ. Then angle ACD = θ. 

Now, in triangle ADC, we have angle at D is 50 degrees, angle at C is angle ACD = θ, and angle at A is what we need to find. Wait, but triangle ADC's angles sum to 180 degrees. So angle at D (50) + angle at C (θ) + angle at A (let's call it φ) = 180. So φ = 180 - 50 - θ = 130 - θ. 

But we need to find φ, which is angle at A, i.e., angle DAC. 

But angle CAB is θ, which is part of angle DAC? Wait, angle CAB is the angle at A between CA and AB. But angle DAC is the angle at A between DA and CA. Since D is on the extension of AB, DA is colinear with AB. So angle DAC is the same as angle CAB. Wait, because DA is along AB extended. So if you look at angle between DA and CA, that's the same as angle CAB. Therefore, angle CAB = angle DAC = φ. 

Wait, but earlier we said angle ACD = angle CAB (from Alternate Segment Theorem). So angle ACD = θ = angle CAB = φ. 

From triangle ADC, we had φ + θ + 50 = 180 → φ + φ + 50 = 180 → 2φ = 130 → φ = 65 degrees. But that contradicts unless my reasoning is wrong. 

Wait, hold on. Let me re-examine. 

Alternate Segment Theorem: angle between tangent CD and chord CA is equal to angle in alternate segment. The alternate segment would be the arc opposite to where the angle is. So angle ACD equals angle CAB. 

Yes, angle between tangent CD and chord CA is angle ACD, and that equals angle CAB (angle in alternate segment, which is the angle subtended by arc CB). 

So angle ACD = angle CAB. 

But angle CAB is part of triangle ABC, which is a right triangle since AB is diameter. So triangle ABC is right-angled at C. Therefore, angle CAB + angle CBA = 90 degrees. 

But how does this relate to our previous equation? 

Earlier, in triangle ADC, angles: angle at D is 50, angle at C is angle ACD = θ = angle CAB, angle at A is angle DAC. Wait, but angle DAC is adjacent to angle CAB? No, because D is on AB extended. So angle DAC is the same as angle CAB. Wait, if you imagine point D on the extension of AB beyond B, then angle DAC is the angle between DA (which is AB extended) and CA. Which is the same as angle CAB. Therefore, angle DAC = angle CAB. 

So in triangle ADC, angles: 
angle at D: 50°
angle at C: angle ACD = angle CAB = θ
angle at A: angle DAC = θ 

Therefore, total angles: 50 + θ + θ = 180 → 2θ = 130 → θ = 65°. Therefore, angle DAC is 65°, which would be the answer. But none of the options is 65. Wait, but the answer choices are A:20°, B:25°, C:.40°, D:50°. So that suggests a mistake in my reasoning. 

Hmm. Where did I go wrong? Let me check again. 

Wait, maybe angle ACD is not equal to angle CAB. Let me recall the Alternate Segment Theorem properly. The angle between tangent and chord is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. So, in this case, the tangent is CD, and chord is CA. The angle between them is angle ACD. The alternate segment would be the arc that doesn't contain the point where the tangent meets the circle. Since the tangent is at C, the alternate segment would be the arc opposite to where the angle is. 

In this case, the angle between tangent CD and chord CA is equal to the angle that the chord CA makes with the circumference in the alternate segment. So angle ACD equals angle CBA, because angle CBA is subtended by arc CA. 

Wait, yes! Because angle CBA is in the alternate segment. So angle between tangent CD and chord CA is equal to angle CBA, not angle CAB. 

That was my mistake earlier. So angle ACD = angle CBA. 

So angle ACD = angle CBA. 

Now, let's redefine variables. Let me denote angle CBA as α. Then angle ACD = α. 

In triangle ABC, since it's right-angled at C (because AB is diameter), then angle CAB + angle CBA = 90°. Let's denote angle CAB as β. So β + α = 90°. 

Now, looking back at triangle ADC. Angles at D is 50°, angle at C is angle ACD = α, angle at A is angle DAC. What is angle DAC? 

Since D is on the extension of AB beyond B, then DA is a straight line from D through B to A. So angle DAC is the angle between DA and CA. Which is the same as angle CAB (β), because angle CAB is between CA and AB, and DA is the extension of AB. Therefore, angle DAC = β. 

Thus, in triangle ADC, angles are: 
at D: 50°
at C: α
at A: β 

Summing up: 50 + α + β = 180. 

But from triangle ABC, β + α = 90°. 

Substitute into the first equation: 50 + (α + β) = 50 + 90 = 140. Wait, that sums to 140, but the total should be 180. There's inconsistency here. 

This implies that my assumption is incorrect. Where's the error? 

Ah, maybe angle at C in triangle ADC is not α. Let me think again. 

Angle at C in triangle ADC is angle ACD. Earlier, I thought it's equal to angle CBA (α). But let me confirm with Alternate Segment Theorem. 

The Alternate Segment Theorem says angle between tangent and chord equals angle in alternate segment. The angle between tangent CD and chord CA is angle ACD. The alternate segment is the arc AC that doesn't contain the point of tangency. The angle in the alternate segment would be the angle subtended by arc AC at the circumference. Which would be angle ABC, since AB is the diameter. Wait, no. Arc AC corresponds to angle subtended at the circumference. 

Actually, the angle in the alternate segment is the angle subtended by the chord CA in the alternate segment. Since the tangent is at C, the alternate segment is the arc AC that doesn't pass through B. Wait, the arc AC that's not containing the point where the tangent is drawn. Wait, the tangent is at C, so the alternate segment would be the arc AC that's opposite to the tangent. 

The angle subtended by arc AC at the circumference would be angle ABC, since AB is diameter. Wait, no. Let me think again. 

When you have a tangent at point C, the angle between tangent CD and chord CA is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. The alternate segment would be the arc AC that doesn't include the point where the tangent is drawn. Wait, actually, the angle in the alternate segment is the angle subtended by the chord CA at any point on the alternate segment. 

For instance, if the tangent is at C, then the alternate segment is the arc AC that is opposite to the tangent. So the angle between CD and CA (angle ACD) is equal to the angle subtended by arc AC at the circumference in the alternate segment. That would be angle ABC, because point B is on the circumference, and arc AC. 

Wait, angle ABC is subtended by arc AC. Since AB is the diameter, angle ABC is an angle in the triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C. So angle ABC is complementary to angle CAB. 

Therefore, angle ACD (between tangent CD and chord CA) equals angle ABC. So angle ACD = angle ABC = α. 

Now, going back to triangle ADC. Its angles are: 
at D: 50°
at C: angle ACD = α
at A: angle DAC = ?

What is angle DAC? As before, since D is on the extension of AB, angle DAC is the same as angle CAB (β). Because DA is extending AB beyond B, so angle between DA and CA is the same as angle between CA and AB, which is angle CAB. 

So, in triangle ADC: angles are 50° (at D), α (at C), and β (at A). Summing these gives 50 + α + β = 180. 

But from triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C, we have α + β = 90°. 

Substituting into the equation: 50 + 90 = 140, which is less than 180. Contradiction. 

This indicates a flaw in the reasoning. Let me reconsider. 

Maybe angle at C in triangle ADC is not just α. Perhaps there's another component. Let me try drawing the diagram mentally. 

Point D is on the extension of AB beyond B. Line CD is tangent at C. So, in triangle ADC, angle at C is angle ACD. From the Alternate Segment Theorem, angle ACD equals angle ABC (α). 

But angle ABC is part of triangle ABC. And angle at A in triangle ABC is β. 

But in triangle ADC, we have angle at A as angle DAC. How is this related to β? 

If you imagine point D on AB extended, then angle DAC is the same as angle CAB, which is β. 

So, in triangle ADC: angles are 50° (at D), α (at C), and β (at A). Their sum is 50 + α + β = 180. 

But from triangle ABC: α + β = 90°. 

So substituting: 50 + 90 = 140, which is missing 40 degrees. Where is the error? 

Ah! Wait, angle at C in triangle ADC is not α alone. Because angle ACD is α, but in triangle ADC, angle at C is angle ACD plus another angle? No, in triangle ADC, angle at C is just angle ACD. Unless there's another angle. 

Wait, no. In triangle ADC, the angles are at A, D, and C. At point C, it's angle between DC and CA, which is angle ACD = α. So why is the sum not adding up? 

This suggests that my understanding of the Alternate Segment Theorem may be incorrect. Let me double-check the theorem. 

According to the Alternate Segment Theorem, the angle between the tangent and the chord at the point of contact is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate segment. So, in this case, angle between tangent CD and chord CA at point C is equal to the angle subtended by chord CA in the alternate segment. 

The alternate segment would be the arc AC that doesn't contain the point where the tangent is drawn. Since the tangent is at C, the alternate segment is the arc AC that is opposite to the tangent. This arc AC subtends an angle at the circumference. 

Which angle does it subtend? The angle subtended by arc AC at any point on the circumference in the alternate segment. For example, point B. Because AB is the diameter, and point B is on the circle. So, the angle subtended by arc AC at point B is angle ABC. 

Therefore, angle between tangent CD and chord CA (angle ACD) equals angle ABC. So angle ACD = angle ABC = α. 

So this still holds. 

Then, in triangle ADC, angles are 50°, α, β, totaling 50+α+β=180. 

But from triangle ABC, α + β = 90°, leading to 50+90=140, which is impossible. 

Clearly, there's a contradiction here, implying an error in assumptions. Let me think differently. 

Maybe angle at C in triangle ADC is not just α. Perhaps there's another angle involved. For example, angle at C in triangle ADC is angle ACD, which is α, but also, there's another angle at C? No, because in triangle ADC, only one angle at point C. 

Wait, perhaps the error is in identifying which angle is which. Let me try to assign variables again. 

Let me denote angle ACD as γ. According to Alternate Segment Theorem, γ = angle ABC = α. 

In triangle ADC, angles are: 
- at D: 50°
- at C: γ = α
- at A: let's call it δ 

So, 50 + α + δ = 180 → δ = 130 - α. 

But angle δ is angle at A in triangle ADC, which is angle DAC. As discussed earlier, this should be equal to angle CAB (β). So δ = β. 

Thus, β = 130 - α. 

But from triangle ABC, since it's right-angled at C, α + β = 90°. 

So we have two equations: 
1. α + β = 90°
2. β = 130 - α 

Substituting equation 2 into equation 1: 
α + (130 - α) = 90 → 130 = 90, which is impossible. 

This contradiction suggests a fundamental error in my approach. 

Alternative idea: Maybe angle at D is not 50°, but another angle. Wait, the problem states "measure Of(Angle(D),50.0)". But what is angle D? It could refer to angle ADC, which we've been assuming. Or perhaps angle at D in another triangle. 

Looking back at the predicates, there's a RightAngle(Angle(O,C,D)) and MeasureOf(Angle(O,C,D),90.0). So angle OCD is 90 degrees. 

Also, there's a line CD, which is tangent at C, and line AB is extended to meet CD at D. 

Let me consider triangle OCD, which is right-angled at C. OC is a radius, CD is tangent, so OC ⊥ CD. 

In triangle OCD, right-angled at C. So angle at C is 90°, angle at O is something, angle at D is something. 

Let me calculate those angles. Let's denote angle at D as θ. Then angle at O is 90 - θ. 

But how does this relate to other parts? 

Also, OA is a radius, so OA = OC = r. 

In triangle OAC, OA = OC, so it's an isosceles triangle with OA = OC. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. Wait, triangle OAC has sides OA and OC equal. So angles at A and C are equal. 

Wait, triangle OAC: vertices O, A, C. OA and OC are both radii, so OA=OC. So triangle OAC is isosceles with base AC and equal sides OA and OC. Therefore, angles at A and C are equal. 

So angle at A (OAC) equals angle at C (OCA). 

Let me denote those angles as φ. 

So, in triangle OAC, angles: at A: φ, at C: φ, at O: 180 - 2φ. 

But angle at O in triangle OAC is angle AOC. 

Now, since AB is the diameter, and O is the center, OA is half of AB. 

But how does this connect with other parts? 

Alternatively, let's look at triangle OCD. Right-angled at C. OC = r, CD is tangent, so CD = sqrt(OD² - OC²). 

But without knowing lengths, maybe using angles. 

Let me try to relate angles in triangle OCD and triangle OAC. 

From triangle OCD: angle at D is θ, angle at C is 90°, angle at O is 90 - θ. 

From triangle OAC: angles at A and C are φ each, and angle at O is 180 - 2φ. 

But angle at O in triangle OAC is angle AOC, which is the central angle corresponding to arc AC. 

Meanwhile, in triangle OCD, angle at O is angle COD. Are these angles related? 

Yes! Because point D lies on line AB extended, and O is the center. So angle COD is the angle between OC and OD. 

But OD is along the line AB extended, since D is on AB extended. So OD is along AB. Therefore, angle COD is the angle between OC and OD, which is the same as angle COB, since OD is along AB. 

Wait, if D is on the extension of AB beyond B, then OD is along AB. So angle COD is the angle between OC and OD, which is the same as angle COB. 

Because OD is aligned with AB, so angle COD is the same as angle COB. 

But angle COB is the central angle corresponding to arc CB. 

Since AB is the diameter, angle AOB is 180°. So angle COB depends on where C is. 

But maybe we can relate angles in triangle OCD and triangle OAC. 

In triangle OCD: angle at O is angle COD = angle COB = let's call it ψ. So angle COD = ψ. 

In triangle OCD: angles are 90° at C, ψ at O, and θ at D. So ψ + θ + 90° = 180° → ψ + θ = 90° → θ = 90° - ψ. 

But ψ is angle COB. 

Now, angle COB is the central angle for arc CB. In triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C, angle at B is α, which corresponds to arc AC. Wait, perhaps we need to relate these angles. 

Alternatively, since OA = OC, and angle OAC = φ, as previously defined. 

In triangle OAC, angle at A is φ, which is angle OAC. 

But angle OAC is also part of triangle ADC. 

Wait, angle OAC is the same as angle CAB (since O is the center, and A is on the circle). 

Wait, angle OAC is the angle between OA and AC. Since OA is a radius, and AC is a chord. 

But angle CAB is the angle between CA and AB. Since OA is along AB, angle OAC is the same as angle CAB. 

Thus, φ = angle CAB = β. 

Also, in triangle OAC, angle at C is φ (angle OCA). 

But angle OCA is part of the right angle at C in triangle OCD. 

Wait, angle OCA is part of line OC, which is perpendicular to CD. So angle between OC and CD is 90°. 

But angle OCA is part of triangle OAC, and also relates to angle between OC and CD. 

Wait, at point C, we have line OC (radius) and line CD (tangent), forming a right angle. Also, line AC is present. So at point C, we have two lines: OC and CD, which form 90°, and line AC. 

So, angle between OC and CD is 90°, and angle between OC and AC is angle OCA = φ. 

Therefore, the angle between AC and CD is angle ACD = angle between AC and CD = angle between AC and CD, which is angle ACD = 90° - φ. 

Wait, because at point C, the angle between OC and CD is 90°, and angle between OC and AC is φ. So the angle between AC and CD would be 90° - φ. 

But earlier, according to the Alternate Segment Theorem, this angle (between AC and CD) should equal angle ABC. So:

angle ACD = 90° - φ = angle ABC = α. 

So α = 90° - φ. 

But φ is angle OAC, which is angle CAB = β. So α = 90° - β. 

But from triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C, we have α + β = 90°. 

So substituting α = 90° - β into α + β = 90° gives (90° - β) + β = 90°, which is true. So no new info. 

Back to triangle ADC. Let me re-express the angles. 

In triangle ADC: 
- angle at D: 50°
- angle at C: angle ACD = α = 90° - β
- angle at A: angle DAC = β 

So sum of angles: 50 + (90 - β) + β = 50 + 90 = 140°, which is still missing 40°. 

Where is this discrepancy coming from? 

Wait, maybe angle at C in triangle ADC is not α. Let me recheck. 

Earlier, we said angle ACD = 90° - φ, where φ = β. So angle ACD = 90° - β. 

But in triangle ADC, angle at C is angle ACD = 90° - β. 

So the angles in triangle ADC are: 
- at D: 50°
- at C: 90° - β
- at A: β 

Sum: 50 + (90 - β) + β = 140°. Still missing 40°. 

This suggests that my identification of the angles is incorrect. 

Let me try to use coordinate geometry. Let's assign coordinates to make calculations concrete. 

Let’s set O at (0,0), A at (-1,0), B at (1,0), so AB is diameter of length 2 units. Let’s choose point C on the circle. Let's pick C at (0,1) for simplicity. Then OC is vertical, and tangent at C would be horizontal line (since OC is vertical, tangent is horizontal). So line CD is horizontal, passing through C(0,1), so it's the line y=1. 

Intersection of y=1 with AB (which is x-axis) is at infinity? No, wait, AB is the x-axis from (-1,0) to (1,0). The line y=1 is horizontal and doesn't intersect AB. Wait, this suggests that if C is at (0,1), then the tangent at C is horizontal, and it doesn't meet AB extended. But according to the problem, CD meets extended AB at D. So this choice of C is invalid. 

Let me choose another point C. Let's say C is at (cosθ, sinθ). Let's choose θ such that the tangent at C meets AB extended at D. 

The tangent at C is perpendicular to OC. If OC has slope m, then tangent has slope -1/m. 

Let me choose C at (1,0), but that's point B. Not helpful. Let me choose C at (cosθ, sinθ) where θ is not 90° or 0°. Let's take θ = 60°, so C is at (0.5, √3/2). 

Slope of OC is (√3/2)/0.5 = √3. So tangent at C has slope -1/√3. Equation of tangent line at C: y - √3/2 = -1/√3 (x - 0.5). 

Find intersection D with AB (y=0). 

Set y=0: 0 - √3/2 = -1/√3 (x - 0.5) → -√3/2 = -1/√3 x + 0.5/√3. Multiply both sides by √3: -3/2 = -x + 0.5 → x = 0.5 + 3/2 = 2. So D is at (2, 0). 

Now, let's compute angle at D, which is angle ADC. Points A(-1,0), D(2,0), C(0.5, √3/2). 

Compute vectors DA and DC. DA is from D to A: (-1-2, 0-0) = (-3, 0). DC is from D to C: (0.5-2, √3/2 - 0) = (-1.5, √3/2). 

Angle at D is between DA and DC. Let's compute this angle using dot product. 

Vector DA: (-3, 0)
Vector DC: (-1.5, √3/2)

Dot product: (-3)(-1.5) + (0)(√3/2) = 4.5 + 0 = 4.5

Magnitude of DA: sqrt((-3)^2 + 0^2) = 3

Magnitude of DC: sqrt((-1.5)^2 + (√3/2)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 3/4) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.75) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732

Cosine of angle at D: (4.5) / (3 * sqrt(3)) = (4.5)/(3*1.732) ≈ 4.5/(5.196) ≈ 0.866. 

Which corresponds to cosine 60°, since cos(60°) = 0.5? Wait, no. Wait 0.866 is approximately cos(30°). Wait, cos(30°) is √3/2 ≈ 0.866. So angle at D is 30°. 

But in this case, angle D is 30°, but the problem states it's 50°. So this suggests that depending on the position of C, angle D varies. 

But in this example, angle D is 30°, and angle at A (angle DAC) is the angle between DA and CA. Let's compute that. 

Point A(-1,0), D(2,0), C(0.5, √3/2). Vector DA is from A to D: (3, 0). Vector AC is from A to C: (0.5 - (-1), √3/2 - 0) = (1.5, √3/2). 

Angle at A (DAC) is between DA and AC. 

Vectors DA: (3, 0) and AC: (1.5, √3/2). 

Dot product: 3*1.5 + 0*(√3/2) = 4.5 

Magnitude of DA: 3 

Magnitude of AC: sqrt(1.5² + (√3/2)^2) = sqrt(2.25 + 0.75) = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732 

Cosine of angle: 4.5 / (3 * sqrt(3)) = same as before, ≈ 0.866 → angle is 30°. 

So in this case, angle at D is 30°, and angle at A is 30°. But in the problem, angle D is 50°, so this suggests that angle A would be different. 

But how do we generalize this? Let's derive a relationship between angle D and angle A. 

Let me consider general case. Let’s suppose point C is at (cosθ, sinθ). Then tangent at C has slope -cotθ, since slope of OC is tanθ, so tangent slope is -cotθ. Equation of tangent: y - sinθ = -cotθ (x - cosθ). 

Intersection with AB (y=0): 

0 - sinθ = -cotθ (x - cosθ) → -sinθ = -cotθ x + cotθ cosθ → sinθ = cotθ x - cotθ cosθ. 

cotθ = cosθ/sinθ, so:

sinθ = (cosθ/sinθ)x - (cosθ/sinθ)cosθ → multiply both sides by sinθ:

sin²θ = cosθ x - cos²θ → rearrange: cosθ x = sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 → x = 1/cosθ. 

So point D has x-coordinate 1/cosθ, y=0. 

So coordinates of D are (1/cosθ, 0). 

Now, angle at D is angle ADC. Let's compute this angle. 

Points: A(-1,0), D(1/cosθ, 0), C(cosθ, sinθ). 

Vectors DA and DC: 

DA: from D to A: (-1 - 1/cosθ, 0 - 0) = (-1 - secθ, 0) 

DC: from D to C: (cosθ - 1/cosθ, sinθ - 0) = (cosθ - secθ, sinθ) 

Angle between DA and DC is angle at D. 

Let me compute this angle using dot product. 

Let’s denote vector DA as v = (-1 - secθ, 0), and vector DC as w = (cosθ - secθ, sinθ). 

Dot product v · w = (-1 - secθ)(cosθ - secθ) + 0*sinθ 

Expand: (-1)(cosθ - secθ) - secθ (cosθ - secθ) 

= -cosθ + secθ - secθ cosθ + sec²θ 

Simplify term by term:

First term: -cosθ 

Second term: +secθ 

Third term: -secθ cosθ = -1 

Fourth term: +sec²θ 

Combine terms: -cosθ + secθ -1 + sec²θ 

Note that secθ = 1/cosθ, so let's express everything in terms of cosθ. 

Let me rewrite:

- cosθ + (1/cosθ) - 1 + (1/cos²θ) 

Let me combine terms:

Let me write as: (1/cos²θ) + (1/cosθ) - cosθ - 1 

This seems complicated, but maybe simplify further. Let's factor terms. 

Alternatively, let's compute magnitude of vectors v and w. 

|v| = sqrt[ (-1 - secθ)^2 + 0 ] = | -1 - secθ | = 1 + secθ (since secθ > 0 if θ is acute) 

|w| = sqrt[ (cosθ - secθ)^2 + sin²θ ]

Expand (cosθ - secθ)^2 = cos²θ - 2 cosθ secθ + sec²θ = cos²θ - 2 + sec²θ 

Add sin²θ: cos²θ - 2 + sec²θ + sin²θ = (cos²θ + sin²θ) - 2 + sec²θ = 1 - 2 + sec²θ = -1 + sec²θ 

So |w| = sqrt(sec²θ - 1) = tanθ 

So |w| = tanθ 

Now, the dot product v · w = (1/cos²θ) + (1/cosθ) - cosθ - 1 

Let me compute this expression:

Let me write all terms with denominator cos²θ:

= (1/cos²θ) + (cosθ/ccos²θ) - (cos³θ/cos²θ) - (cos²θ/cos²θ) 

Wait, this might not be helpful. Let me substitute numerical values for θ to see if it helps. 

Suppose angle D is 50°, and we want to find angle at A. Let me assume that angle at D is 50°, and find θ such that this holds, then compute angle at A. 

However, this might require solving complex equations. 

Alternatively, let me note that in the earlier example with θ = 60°, angle at D was 30°, and angle at A was 30°. So in that case, angle D = angle A. 

Maybe generally, angle at D equals angle at A? If that's the case, then if angle D is 50°, angle A is 50°, but option D is 50°. But in the example, it was 30°, which matched. 

But let me test with another θ. Let's take θ = 45°. 

Then, point C is at (cos45°, sin45°) = (√2/2, √2/2). 

Slope of OC is 1, so tangent slope is -1. Equation of tangent: y - √2/2 = -1(x - √2/2) → y = -x + √2. 

Intersection with AB (y=0): 0 = -x + √2 → x = √2. So D is at (√2, 0). 

Now, compute angle at D. 

Points A(-1,0), D(√2, 0), C(√2/2, √2/2). 

Vectors DA: from D to A: (-1 - √2, 0) 

Vector DC: from D to C: (√2/2 - √2, √2/2 - 0) = (-√2/2, √2/2) 

Dot product: (-1 - √2)(-√2/2) + 0*(√2/2) = (1 + √2)(√2/2) = [√2/2 + (√2 * √2)/2] = √2/2 + 2/2 = √2/2 + 1 

Magnitude of DA: sqrt[(-1 - √2)^2] = 1 + √2 

Magnitude of DC: sqrt[ (-√2/2)^2 + (√2/2)^2 ] = sqrt( (2/4) + (2/4) ) = sqrt(1) = 1 

Cosine of angle at D: [√2/2 + 1] / [(1 + √2) * 1] = [1 + √2/2] / (1 + √2) 

Multiply numerator and denominator by 2: [2 + √2]/[2(1 + √2)] 

Rationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by (1 - √2):

Numerator: (2 + √2)(1 - √2) = 2(1) - 2√2 + √2 - (√2)^2 = 2 - 2√2 + √2 - 2 = (2-2) + (-2√2 + √2) = -√2 

Denominator: 2(1 + √2)(1 - √2) = 2(1 - 2) = 2(-1) = -2 

So overall: (-√2)/(-2) = √2/2 ≈ 0.707, which is cos(45°). So angle at D is 45°. 

And angle at A is angle DAC. Let's compute it. 

Vectors DA: from A to D: (√2 - (-1), 0 - 0) = (1 + √2, 0) 

Vector AC: from A to C: (√2/2 - (-1), √2/2 - 0) = (√2/2 + 1, √2/2) 

Dot product of DA and AC: (1 + √2)(√2/2 + 1) + 0*(√2/2) = (1 + √2)(1 + √2/2) 

Expand: 1*(1) + 1*(√2/2) + √2*(1) + √2*(√2/2) = 1 + √2/2 + √2 + (2/2) = 1 + √2/2 + √2 + 1 = 2 + (3√2)/2 

Magnitude of DA: 1 + √2 

Magnitude of AC: sqrt[(√2/2 + 1)^2 + (√2/2)^2] 

Let me compute:

(√2/2 + 1)^2 = (1 + √2/2)^2 = 1 + √2 + (2/4) = 1 + √2 + 0.5 = 1.5 + √2 

Adding (√2/2)^2 = 0.5 

Total under sqrt: 1.5 + √2 + 0.5 = 2 + √2 

So magnitude of AC is sqrt(2 + √2) 

Thus, cosine of angle at A is [2 + (3√2)/2] / [(1 + √2) * sqrt(2 + √2)] 

This seems complex, but let me evaluate numerically. 

Let me approximate √2 ≈ 1.414. 

Numerator: 2 + (3*1.414)/2 ≈ 2 + 2.121 = 4.121 

Denominator: (1 + 1.414) * sqrt(2 + 1.414) ≈ 2.414 * sqrt(3.414) ≈ 2.414 * 1.847 ≈ 4.452 

So cosine(angle) ≈ 4.121 / 4.452 ≈ 0.926, which is close to cos(22°). Wait, but angle at D was 45°, and angle at A is approximately 22°, which doesn't match. But this contradicts the earlier pattern where angle D = angle A. 

Wait, this suggests that my previous assumption that angle D equals angle A is incorrect. 

This indicates that the relationship between angle D and angle A depends on θ, and thus requires a more careful analysis. 

Given the complexity, perhaps there is a better way using geometric theorems. 

Let me revisit the earlier equations. 

From the Alternate Segment Theorem, angle between tangent CD and chord CA is equal to angle ABC. Let's call this angle α. 

In triangle ADC, angles are: at D: 50°, at C: α, at A: β. 

Sum: 50 + α + β = 180 → α + β = 130. 

But from triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C, we have α + β = 90°. 

Wait, this is conflicting. 

Unless angle α is not angle ABC but another angle. 

Wait, let me re-express: the angle between tangent CD and chord CA is equal to the angle subtended by chord CA in the alternate segment. 

The alternate segment is the arc AC that doesn't contain the point of tangency. This arc AC subtends an angle at the circumference, which would be angle ABC, since AB is the diameter. 

Wait, but if the arc AC is subtended by angle at B, then angle ABC is indeed equal to the angle between tangent and chord. 

So angle between CD and CA is angle ABC. 

But in triangle ABC, angle ABC + angle BAC = 90°. 

Let me denote angle ABC as α, angle BAC as β. 

So in triangle ADC: angles at D: 50°, at C: α, at A: β. 

Sum: 50 + α + β = 180 → α + β = 130. 

But from triangle ABC: α + β = 90. 

Contradiction. 

This suggests that either the Alternate Segment Theorem is applied incorrectly, or there is a misidentification of the angle. 

Let me consult a reference: Alternate Segment Theorem states that the angle between the tangent and chord at the point of contact is equal to the angle in the alternate segment. 

In this case, the angle between tangent CD and chord CA is equal to the angle subtended by chord CA in the alternate segment. 

The alternate segment is the arc AC that is not containing the point where the tangent meets the circle (point C). So the angle in the alternate segment is the angle subtended by arc AC at any point on the circumference in the alternate segment. 

Since AB is the diameter, the alternate segment would include point B. So the angle subtended by arc AC at point B is angle ABC. 

Therefore, angle between CD and CA (angle ACD) = angle ABC = α. 

Thus, in triangle ADC, angle at C is α, angle at D is 50°, angle at A is β. 

Sum: 50 + α + β = 180. 

But from triangle ABC: α + β = 90. 

So 50 + 90 = 140, which is not 180. 

This suggests that my identification of the angles is incorrect. 

Let me think about the possibility that angle at C in triangle ADC is not α but something else. 

Maybe angle at C in triangle ADC is angle ACD, which is angle between AC and CD. Which is equal to angle ABC (α). 

But in triangle ADC, angle at C is angle ACD = α. 

Angle at A is angle DAC. 

But angle DAC is the same as angle BAC (β), because DA is along AB extended. 

So, in triangle ADC, angles are: 50°, α, β. 

Sum: 50 + α + β = 180. 

From triangle ABC: α + β = 90. 

So 50 + 90 = 140, which is not 180. 

This suggests that there is an extra angle somewhere. 

Wait, perhaps angle at C in triangle ADC is not just α, but includes another angle? 

No, because at point C, there is only one angle in triangle ADC, which is angle ACD. 

Unless there is a miscalculation in applying the Alternate Segment Theorem. 

Let me try to think differently. Let's consider the entire diagram and use power of a point. 

Point D lies outside the circle, and DC is tangent to the circle at C. So DC² = DA * DB. 

Let me denote DA = x, DB = y, so DC² = x * y. 

But AB is the diameter, so AB = 2r. Let's assume AB = 2, so r = 1. 

Let me set coordinates with O at (0,0), A at (-1,0), B at (1,0). Let C be at (cosθ, sinθ). 

Then, as before, point D is at (1/cosθ, 0). 

So DA = distance from D to A: 1/cosθ - (-1) = 1/cosθ + 1 = (1 + cosθ)/cosθ 

DB = distance from D to B: 1/cosθ - 1 = (1 - cosθ)/cosθ 

Thus, DC² = DA * DB = [(1 + cosθ)/cosθ] * [(1 - cosθ)/cosθ] = (1 - cos²θ)/cos²θ = sin²θ / cos²θ = tan²θ 

But DC is the length of the tangent from D to the circle, which is sqrt(OD² - r²). 

OD is the distance from O to D: 1/cosθ. So OD = 1/cosθ. 

Thus, DC = sqrt(OD² - r²) = sqrt(1/cos²θ - 1) = sqrt( (1 - cos²θ)/cos²θ ) = sinθ / cosθ = tanθ. 

So DC = tanθ, hence DC² = tan²θ, which matches the earlier calculation. 

Now, let's find angle at D. 

Using the law of sines in triangle ADC. 

In triangle ADC, sides: 

AD = (1 + cosθ)/cosθ 

DC = tanθ 

AC: distance from A to C: sqrt[(cosθ + 1)^2 + (sinθ)^2] = sqrt(cos²θ + 2cosθ + 1 + sin²θ) = sqrt(2 + 2cosθ) = 2cos(θ/2) 

Wait, using identity: cos²θ + sin²θ = 1, so expression becomes sqrt(1 + 2cosθ + 1) = sqrt(2(1 + cosθ)) = 2cos(θ/2) 

So AC = 2cos(θ/2) 

Now, in triangle ADC, using the law of sines: 

sin(angle at D)/AC = sin(angle at C)/AD = sin(angle at A)/DC 

Let me denote angle at D as 50°, angle at C as α, angle at A as β. 

So: 

sin(50°)/AC = sin(α)/AD = sin(β)/DC 

But from earlier, AC = 2cos(θ/2), AD = (1 + cosθ)/cosθ, DC = tanθ. 

Also, from the Alternate Segment Theorem, angle at C (α) = angle ABC. 

In triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C, angle ABC = α = angle between BC and AB. 

Let me compute α in terms of θ. 

Point B is at (1,0), C is at (cosθ, sinθ). 

Vector BC is (cosθ - 1, sinθ - 0) = (cosθ - 1, sinθ) 

Vector BA is (-2, 0) 

Angle ABC is the angle between BC and BA. 

Using dot product: 

cosα = (BC · BA) / (|BC| |BA|) 

BC · BA = (cosθ - 1)(-2) + sinθ * 0 = -2(cosθ - 1) 

|BC| = sqrt((cosθ - 1)^2 + sin²θ) = sqrt(cos²θ - 2cosθ + 1 + sin²θ) = sqrt(2(1 - cosθ)) 

|BA| = 2 

So cosα = [-2(cosθ - 1)] / [sqrt(2(1 - cosθ)) * 2] = [-2(1 - cosθ)] / [2sqrt(2(1 - cosθ))] = -(1 - cosθ)/sqrt(2(1 - cosθ)) = -sqrt(1 - cosθ)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt[(1 - cosθ)/2] 

But (1 - cosθ)/2 = sin²(θ/2), so this becomes -sin(θ/2) 

Thus, cosα = -sin(θ/2) → α = arccos(-sin(θ/2)) 

This is getting complex, but let's proceed. 

Now, back to the law of sines in triangle ADC: 

sin(50°)/AC = sin(α)/AD 

Substitute AC = 2cos(θ/2), AD = (1 + cosθ)/cosθ 

So: 

sin(50°) / (2cos(θ/2)) = sin(α) / [(1 + cosθ)/cosθ] 

Cross-multiplying: 

sin(50°) * (1 + cosθ)/cosθ = 2cos(θ/2) * sin(α) 

But α is arccos(-sin(θ/2)), which is complex to handle. 

Alternatively, let me use specific angle D = 50° to find θ. 

Assume angle at D is 50°, and try to find θ. 

But this requires solving complex equations. 

Alternatively, let's assume that angle at A is what we need to find, and relate it to angle D. 

From earlier examples, when angle D was 30°, angle A was 30°; when angle D was 45°, angle A was approximately 22°. This suggests that angle D and angle A are related but not necessarily equal. 

However, in the first example, with θ = 60°, angle D was 30°, and angle A was 30°. 

Maybe there's a relation where angle D = 2 * angle A, or something like that. 

Let me assume that angle D = 2 * angle A. If angle D is 50°, then angle A would be 25°, which is option B. 

This is plausible. Let me check with the first example: angle D was 30°, angle A was 30°, which doesn't fit. But in the second example, angle D was 45°, angle A was approximately 22°, which also doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle A = 50° - 90°/2 = 50° - 45° = 5°, which is not among the options. 

This suggests that without a clear relationship, it's difficult to proceed. 

Let me return to the initial contradiction: in triangle ADC, angles sum to 140°, but should be 180°. This suggests that there is an additional angle of 40°, which might be the angle at C in triangle ADC. 

Wait, perhaps angle at C is not just α but includes the right angle from the tangent. 

Wait, at point C, we have the tangent CD and the radius OC, which are perpendicular. Also, we have line AC. So at point C, there are two angles: one between OC and CD (90°), and one between OC and AC (φ = β). 

Thus, the angle between AC and CD is 90° - φ = 90° - β. 

But this angle is angle ACD, which is equal to α (from Alternate Segment Theorem). So 90° - β = α. 

From triangle ABC, α + β = 90°, so substituting α = 90° - β into this gives (90° - β) + β = 90°, which is consistent. 

Now, in triangle ADC, angle at C is 90° - β, angle at D is 50°, angle at A is β. 

Sum: (90° - β) + 50° + β = 140°. Still missing 40°. 

Where is this missing 40°? It must be that there is an additional angle, but I'm missing it. 

Wait, perhaps the angle at C in triangle ADC is not 90° - β, but includes the right angle. 

Wait, at point C, the angle between CD and CA is 90° - β, but there is also the angle between OC and CD, which is 90°. But this is not part of triangle ADC. 

I think the issue is that I'm not accounting for the fact that angle at C in triangle ADC is part of the right angle at C. 

Wait, no, in triangle ADC, the angle at C is just angle ACD, which is 90° - β. 

But this leads to the sum of angles being 140°, which is inconsistent. 

This suggests that there is a fundamental error in the assumptions. 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll try to look for another approach. 

Since AB is diameter, and CD is tangent at C, then OC is perpendicular to CD. Also, OA = OC. 

Let me consider triangle ODC. Right-angled at C, with OC = r, OD = ? 

From earlier, OD = 1/cosθ, if C is at (cosθ, sinθ). 

In triangle ODC, right-angled at C, so angle at D is angle ODC. 

Which is equal to angle between OD and DC. 

Let me compute this angle. 

In triangle ODC, angle at D is angle ODC. 

tan(angle ODC) = OC / DC = r / DC. 

But DC = tanθ (from earlier). 

So tan(angle ODC) = r / tanθ. 

But r = 1 (assuming unit circle), so tan(angle ODC) = 1/tanθ = cotθ. 

Thus, angle ODC = arctan(cotθ) = 90° - θ. 

But angle ODC is part of the angle at D in triangle ADC. 

Wait, angle at D in triangle ADC is angle ADC, which is the same as angle ODC. 

Because in triangle ADC, angle at D is between DA and DC, and in triangle ODC, angle at D is between OD and DC. Since DA is along OD (since D is on AB extended), angle ADC is the same as angle ODC. 

Thus, angle ADC = angle ODC = 90° - θ. 

But angle ADC is given as 50°, so 90° - θ = 50° → θ = 40°. 

Now, θ is the angle at C in the circle, which is the central angle for arc AC. 

In triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C, angle at A is β, which is equal to angle OAC. 

Since θ is the central angle for arc AC, the inscribed angle over arc AC is θ/2. 

Wait, the inscribed angle over arc AC is angle ABC, which is α. So α = θ/2. 

But from earlier, α = 90° - β. 

Also, in triangle ABC, β + α = 90°, so β + (θ/2) = 90° → β = 90° - θ/2. 

But we found θ = 40°, so β = 90° - 20° = 70°. 

Wait, but angle at A is β = 70°, which is not among the options. 

But this contradicts the earlier example where θ = 60° gave β = 30°, and angle D = 30°. 

Wait, let me check with θ = 40°. 

If θ = 40°, then angle ADC = 50°, as given. 

Then, β = 90° - θ/2 = 90° - 20° = 70°. 

But this suggests angle at A is 70°, which is not among the options. 

But the options are A:20°, B:25°, C:40°, D:50°. 

This suggests that my calculation is incorrect. 

Let me re-examine. 

We found that angle ADC = 90° - θ = 50° → θ = 40°. 

But θ is the central angle for arc AC. The inscribed angle over arc AC is angle ABC = α = θ/2 = 20°. 

From triangle ABC, α + β = 90° → β = 90° - α = 70°. 

But this is the angle at A, which is β = 70°. 

But this is not among the options. 

However, the problem states that angle D is 50°, and asks for angle A. 

But according to this, angle A is 70°, which is not an option. 

This suggests a mistake in the derivation. 

Wait, let me re-examine the relationship between θ and angle at A. 

θ is the central angle for arc AC, so the inscribed angle over arc AC is θ/2. 

But angle ABC is the inscribed angle over arc AC, so α = θ/2. 

From triangle ABC, α + β = 90°, so β = 90° - α = 90° - θ/2. 

But angle at A is β, which is 90° - θ/2. 

With θ = 40°, β = 90° - 20° = 70°. 

But this is not an option. 

But the problem's options don't include 70°. 

This suggests that there is an error in the relationship between θ and angle at A. 

Let me re-express: 

If θ is the central angle for arc AC, then the inscribed angle over arc AC is θ/2. 

But angle ABC is the inscribed angle over arc AC, so α = θ/2. 

But angle at A in triangle ABC is β = angle BAC. 

In triangle ABC, which is right-angled at C, β + α = 90°. 

So β = 90° - α = 90° - θ/2. 

But angle at A in the problem is angle DAC, which is β. 

But according to this, it is 90° - θ/2. 

With θ = 40°, it's 90° - 20° = 70°, which is not an option. 

But the problem states that angle D is 50°, so θ = 40°. 

But none of the options match 70°. 

This suggests that there is a miscalculation in relating θ to angle at A. 

Let me think about the angle at A. 

Angle at A is angle DAC, which is the angle between DA and CA. 

DA is along AB extended, so it's the same as angle between CA and AB, which is angle CAB = β. 

But in triangle ABC, β = 90° - α = 90° - θ/2. 

But if θ = 40°, then β = 90° - 20° = 70°. 

But this is not an option. 

However, the given options are A:20°, B:25°, C:40°, D:50°. 

Maybe there is a miscalculation in the relationship between θ and angle at A. 

Let me try to find another relation. 

From earlier, in triangle ADC, angle at D is 50°, and angle at C is 90° - β. 

But from the law of sines: 

sin(50°)/AC = sin(90° - β)/AD 

But AC = 2cos(θ/
