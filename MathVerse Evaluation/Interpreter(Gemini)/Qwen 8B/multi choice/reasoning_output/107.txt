MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. 

So, we have a circle O with points A, B, C, D on it. AB is the diameter, so that means points A and B are at opposite ends of the circle. Points C and D are also on the circle. We're told that angle BOD is 130 degrees. The question is asking for the measure of angle ACD.

Let me start by recalling some circle theorems. Since AB is the diameter, any angle subtended by AB on the circumference should be a right angle. Wait, but point C isn't necessarily on AB, though. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Given that angle BOD is 130 degrees. Since O is the center, BO and OD are radii. So triangle BOD is an isosceles triangle because BO = OD (both are radii). The vertex angle at O is 130 degrees, so the base angles at B and D would each be (180 - 130)/2 = 25 degrees. Wait, but angle at B and D? Let me think again. In triangle BOD, angles at B and D are equal because sides BO and OD are equal. So yes, those two angles sum to 50 degrees, each being 25 degrees. So angle OBD and angle ODB are each 25 degrees. Hmm, but how does that relate to other parts?

Now, we need to find angle ACD. Point C is another point on the circle. Let me visualize this. Points A and B are endpoints of the diameter. Points C and D are somewhere on the circumference. The angle at C between points A and D—so angle ACD. That's an inscribed angle. Inscribed angles relate to arcs. Maybe I need to find the arc that corresponds to angle ACD.

Wait, angle ACD is formed by chords AC and DC. So the measure of angle ACD would be half the measure of the arc AD that it intercepts. Wait, no. Wait, inscribed angle theorem says that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. So if angle ACD intercepts arc AD, then angle ACD equals half the measure of arc AD. Alternatively, depending on where the angle is located.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider other arcs. Let me try to find the measure of arc AD first. How can I find that?

Since angle BOD is 130 degrees, and since O is the center, that angle is a central angle. Central angles correspond to the measure of their intercepted arc. Therefore, arc BD measures 130 degrees. Because angle BOD is a central angle intercepting arc BD.

But wait, arc BD is 130 degrees. Now, since AB is the diameter, the entire semicircle from A to B is 180 degrees. Let me see if I can find other arcs.

Also, since AB is a diameter, points A and B are separated by 180 degrees. Let me try to find the position of D relative to other points. Let me imagine the circle with AB as horizontal diameter. Let me place O at the origin. Then, point A is (-r, 0) and B is (r, 0). Point D is somewhere on the circle such that angle BOD is 130 degrees. So starting from point B, rotating 130 degrees towards D around the center O. Depending on direction, clockwise or counterclockwise. Assuming standard position, probably counterclockwise. So if we go from OB to OD, that's 130 degrees. So point D is located 130 degrees counterclockwise from B.

Therefore, the arc BD is 130 degrees. Now, since AB is 180 degrees, the arc from A to B is 180 degrees. To find arc AD, perhaps we can add or subtract arcs. For example, arc AB is 180 degrees. Arc BD is 130 degrees. But arc AD could be arc AB plus arc BD minus something? Wait, depends on the positions. If moving from A to D, passing through B, then arc AD would be arc AB + arc BD? Wait, no. If D is on the same side as B, then arc AD would depend on the direction.

Alternatively, perhaps considering the total circle is 360 degrees. So if arc BD is 130 degrees, then the rest of the circle is 360 - 130 = 230 degrees. But maybe I need to find the arc that relates to angle ACD.

Alternatively, maybe looking at triangle ACD. Let me think about the arcs involved. Angle ACD is an inscribed angle. Which arc does it intercept? The angle at point C, between points A and D. So the intercepted arc would be arc AD that doesn't contain C. Wait, inscribed angle intercepts the arc opposite to the angle. So if angle is at C, then it intercepts arc AD. Therefore, measure of angle ACD is half the measure of arc AD.

So if I can find the measure of arc AD, then divide by 2 to get angle ACD.

So how do I find arc AD?

We know arc BD is 130 degrees. Also, AB is a diameter, so arc AB is 180 degrees. Let me see. Let's consider the positions. Starting from point A, going through B to D. Wait, if arc BD is 130 degrees, then arc AB is 180 degrees. So from A to B is 180 degrees. From B to D is 130 degrees. So total from A to D via B is 180 + 130 = 310 degrees? No, that can't be right because the total circle is 360 degrees. Wait, that suggests that arc AD passing through B is 310 degrees, but the shorter arc would be the other way. However, since angle ACD is an inscribed angle, it depends on which arc AD it intercepts. If the angle is less than 180 degrees, it intercepts the minor arc AD. But if the arc is major, then it would be the major arc.

Wait, but angle ACD is formed by points A, C, D. Depending on where point C is, the intercepted arc could vary. However, since all points are on the circle, perhaps there's a relationship between arcs.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me recall that angle BOD is 130 degrees, which is the central angle for arc BD. Therefore, arc BD is 130 degrees. Then, since AB is a diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. Let me try to find arc AD. Suppose we consider the arc from A to D. If we move from A to B to D, that's arc AB (180 degrees) plus arc BD (130 degrees)? Wait, but that would make arc AD longer than the whole circle. That can't be. So perhaps arc AD is the other way around. Let me think again.

Imagine the circle divided into arcs. AB is a straight line (diameter), so points A and B are 180 degrees apart. If arc BD is 130 degrees, then the position of D is determined relative to B. So if we take point B, and move 130 degrees along the circumference towards the direction that would make D lie on the circle. Let's assume the circle is oriented with AB horizontal. If angle BOD is 130 degrees, then D is above the diameter AB. So from point B, moving counterclockwise 130 degrees to reach D. So the arc BD is 130 degrees. Therefore, from point A, going counterclockwise to D would pass through B, but that would be arc AB (180 degrees) plus arc BD (130 degrees) = 310 degrees, which is more than half the circle. Therefore, the minor arc AD would actually be the other way, going clockwise from A to D, which would be arc AB (from A to B) minus arc BD? Not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps considering that the entire circle is 360 degrees. Arc BD is 130 degrees. So the remaining arcs would be 360 - 130 = 230 degrees. But how does that split? Well, arc AB is 180 degrees. Let me think about the location of D. If AB is the diameter, and D is such that arc BD is 130 degrees, then the arc from B to D is 130 degrees. So the arc from D back to A would be... Let's see. The full circle is 360 degrees. So arc from D to A would be 360 - arc BD - arc BA? Wait, arc BA is part of the diameter. Wait, arc BA is 180 degrees. But if we have arc BD as 130 degrees, then from D to A would be arc DA. Let me consider the positions again. 

From point B, moving counterclockwise 130 degrees gets us to D. So from B to D is 130 degrees. Then, from D back to A, the arc would be the rest of the circle. The total circle is 360 degrees. So arc from D to A would be 360 - arc BD - arc BA? Wait, arc BA is 180 degrees. Wait, no. The arc from B to A is 180 degrees (since AB is a diameter). But arc BD is 130 degrees. So if we go from D to A, that's the arc that goes from D to B to A. Wait, no. Let me think differently. 

Starting at D, going clockwise to A. The arc from D to A would be the arc that goes through the opposite side of the circle. Let me calculate it. Total circle is 360 degrees. Arc BD is 130 degrees. Arc AB is 180 degrees. If I want arc DA, then it's arc from D to A. Depending on direction. Let me imagine that. If we have arc BD = 130 degrees, then the arc from B to D is 130 degrees. The arc from D to A would then be arc DA. Let me think about the positions. If I go from B to D is 130 degrees counterclockwise, then from D to A counterclockwise would be the rest of the circle. So total counterclockwise from D to A would be 360 - arc BD - arc BA? Wait, arc BA is 180 degrees. But arc BD is 130 degrees. So the arc from D to A counterclockwise would be 360 - arc BD - arc BA? No, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should use the fact that the total circumference is 360 degrees. So arc BD is 130 degrees. Arc AB is 180 degrees. So the arc from A to B is 180 degrees. Then, if I want the arc from D to A, it's the arc that goes from D to B to A. Wait, but arc DB is 130 degrees, and arc BA is 180 degrees. So adding them together gives 130 + 180 = 310 degrees. But that seems too much. Wait, but that would mean that the arc DA (passing through B) is 310 degrees, which is the major arc. Therefore, the minor arc DA would be 360 - 310 = 50 degrees. So minor arc DA is 50 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle ACD, which intercepts arc DA, would be half of that, which is 25 degrees. Wait, but that would make angle ACD equal to 25 degrees. But looking at the options, 25 is option C. But wait, let me check again.

Wait, if the arc DA is 50 degrees, then angle ACD would be half of that, which is 25 degrees. So answer C. But let me verify my logic here. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating arc DA. Let me re-express. The arc BD is 130 degrees. The arc from B to D is 130 degrees. The arc from A to B is 180 degrees. So if I want to find arc from D to A, going the other way around the circle. The total circle is 360 degrees. So the arc from D to A would be 360 - arc BD - arc BA? No, that would be 360 - 130 - 180 = 50 degrees. Yes! So arc DA is 50 degrees. Therefore, angle ACD intercepts arc DA, so it's half of that, 25 degrees. Hence, the answer would be 25 degrees, which is option C. 

Wait, but let me confirm. Another way: since angle BOD is 130 degrees, which is a central angle for arc BD. Then, the arc BD is 130 degrees. Now, since AB is a diameter, the arc AB is 180 degrees. Let me think about the position of D. If I draw the circle with AB as diameter, and D is such that arc BD is 130 degrees. Then, the arc from D to A would be arc DA. Let me compute the measure of arc DA. Since the entire circle is 360 degrees, and we have arc BD = 130 degrees, arc AB = 180 degrees. Wait, but arc BD is adjacent to arc AB? Or not? It depends on where D is. Let me think again. If AB is the diameter, and D is on the circle, then the position of D relative to AB determines the arcs. If angle BOD is 130 degrees, then D is positioned such that from point B, moving 130 degrees towards the upper half of the circle (assuming AB is horizontal). So, from point B, moving counterclockwise 130 degrees reaches D. So from point D, moving clockwise to A would cover the arc DA. 

To find the measure of arc DA, we can note that the total circumference is 360 degrees. So arc BD (130 degrees) + arc DA + arc AB? Wait, no. If D is placed such that from B to D is 130 degrees counterclockwise, then from D to A counterclockwise would be the rest of the circle minus arc AB. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the circle as starting at A, going counterclockwise through B to D, then continuing to the rest of the circle. 

But since AB is a diameter, arc AB is 180 degrees. If I go from B to D is 130 degrees, then from D back to A would require going from D to A. If I'm at D, going counterclockwise to A would be arc DA. So the arc from D to A counterclockwise would be 360 - arc BD - arc AB? Wait, no. Let me think of the entire circle. Starting at A, going counterclockwise to B is 180 degrees. From B to D is 130 degrees. So from A to D counterclockwise would be arc AB (180 degrees) + arc BD (130 degrees) = 310 degrees. Therefore, the arc DA that goes the long way around the circle is 310 degrees, making the minor arc DA equal to 360 - 310 = 50 degrees. So the minor arc DA is 50 degrees. Therefore, angle ACD, being an inscribed angle intercepting arc DA, is half of 50 degrees, which is 25 degrees. So angle ACD is 25 degrees, which is option C.

But wait, let me check if angle ACD intercepts arc DA. When you have an inscribed angle at point C, between points A and D, then yes, the intercepted arc is the arc that's opposite to angle C, which is arc AD. Therefore, the measure of angle ACD is half of arc AD. Since arc AD is 50 degrees, angle ACD is 25 degrees. So the answer should be C.

But wait, let me double-check. Is there another way to look at this? For instance, considering triangle COD or something else. Since O is the center, OC and OD are radii. Let me think about triangle OCD. But maybe not necessary.

Another thought: since AB is the diameter, and point C is on the circle, then angle ACB is a right angle. Wait, no, that's if C is on the circle. Wait, yes! Thales' theorem states that any triangle inscribed in a semicircle is a right triangle. So if C is on the circle with AB as diameter, then triangle ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C. But in our case, we're dealing with angle ACD, not angle ACB. So that might not directly help unless we can relate angle ACD to other angles.

Alternatively, perhaps considering triangle ACD. If we can find some relations there. But without knowing where C is, it's hard to say. However, since angle ACD is dependent on arc AD, which we've already determined as 50 degrees, leading to 25 degrees. So unless there's a miscalculation in arc DA.

Wait, let me check once more. If arc BD is 130 degrees, then arc DA is 50 degrees. Therefore, angle ACD is half of that, which is 25 degrees. So the answer is C. 

But let me check the options again. The choices are A:50°, B:30°, C:25°, D:20°. So 25° is option C. Therefore, the answer should be C.
