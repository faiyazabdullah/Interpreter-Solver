MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a quadratic function g that opens downward. It passes through the points (4, -5), (8, -5), and has its vertex at (6, -1). We need to determine if the discriminant of this quadratic is positive, zero, or negative. 

First, I remember that the discriminant of a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 is b² - 4ac. The discriminant tells us about the nature of the roots: if it's positive, there are two distinct real roots; if zero, one real root; and if negative, no real roots. But wait, how does this relate to the graph of the quadratic? Well, the discriminant being positive would mean the parabola crosses the x-axis twice, zero means it touches the axis once (vertex on the x-axis), and negative means it doesn't cross the axis at all. 

But the problem here isn't directly about the roots but about the discriminant's sign. However, maybe I should think about the relationship between the given points and the quadratic's equation. Since the quadratic has a vertex at (6, -1), and opens downward, that gives me some clues. Let's recall that the vertex form of a quadratic is y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Here, h is 6 and k is -1. So substituting those in, the equation becomes y = a(x - 6)² - 1. 

Now, since the quadratic passes through (4, -5) and (8, -5), these points should satisfy the equation. Let me plug in x=4 into the equation to find 'a'. 

Substituting x=4: 
y = a(4 - 6)^2 - 1 = a(-2)^2 -1 = 4a -1. 
We know y is -5 here, so:
4a - 1 = -5 → 4a = -4 → a = -1. 

So the quadratic equation is y = - (x - 6)^2 - 1. Wait, expanding this, let me check. Expanding (x - 6)^2 gives x² -12x +36. Multiply by -1: -x² +12x -36. Then subtract 1: -x² +12x -37. Wait, hold on. Wait, original equation was y = - (x - 6)^2 -1. So expanding (x - 6)^2 is x² -12x +36. Multiplying by -1 gives -x² +12x -36. Then subtract 1: -x² +12x -37. So the standard form is y = -x² +12x -37. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The vertex form is y = a(x-h)^2 +k. So plugging in the vertex (6, -1), it's y = a(x -6)^2 -1. Then using point (4, -5): substitute x=4, y=-5. So:

-5 = a*(4-6)^2 -1 → -5 = a*(4) -1 → -5 +1 = 4a → -4 =4a → a = -1. Correct. So the equation is y = -1*(x-6)^2 -1. Which expands to y = -(x² -12x +36) -1 → -x² +12x -36 -1 → -x² +12x -37. 

So standard form is y = -x² +12x -37. Therefore, comparing to ax² +bx +c, a = -1, b=12, c=-37. 

Then discriminant D = b² -4ac. Plugging in numbers: D = (12)^2 -4*(-1)*(-37). Calculating each part: 12 squared is 144. Then 4ac is 4*(-1)*(-37) = 4*37 = 148. Wait, but discriminant is b² -4ac. So D = 144 - 148 = -4. 

Wait, that's negative. But the question says the quadratic opens downward, which aligns with a being negative (-1), which we've confirmed. So the discriminant here is negative. That would mean the quadratic has no real roots, which makes sense because the vertex is at (6, -1), which is below the x-axis? Wait, no. Wait, the vertex is at (6, -1), which is y-coordinate -1. So the vertex is below the x-axis. And since the parabola opens downward, the entire graph is below the x-axis except for the vertex. Wait, but the vertex is at y=-1, so the minimum point (since it opens downward) is at y=-1. So the maximum point? No, wait, opening downward means the vertex is the highest point. Wait, the vertex is the maximum point because it opens downward. So the vertex is at (6, -1), which is the highest point on the parabola. So the parabola reaches up to y=-1, and then goes down. Therefore, the entire graph is below or at y=-1. Therefore, it never crosses the x-axis. Hence, the discriminant is negative, which matches our calculation. 

Therefore, the discriminant is negative. So the answer should be C: Negative. 

Let me verify again my steps. First, finding the quadratic equation correctly. Vertex form with a=-1, leading to standard form. Then calculating discriminant. Yes, 12^2 is 144, 4ac is 4*(-1)*(-37)=148. So 144-148=-4. Negative. So discriminant is negative. Hence, answer C.
