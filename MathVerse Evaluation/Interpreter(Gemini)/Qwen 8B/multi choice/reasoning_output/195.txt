MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, O, P, and C. There's a circle with center O, and points A and B are on the circle since they're endpoints of a diameter. Also, point C is another point on the circle because it lies on the circle. Then there's a tangent line PC touching the circle at point C. 

First, I need to visualize the setup. Since AB is the diameter of the circle O, and O is the midpoint of AB, that means OA equals OB. The problem states AO = OB = PB = 1.0. Wait, so PB is also 1? Let me note down the given lengths: OA, OB, and PB are each 1 unit long. 

Now, point P is on the extended line AB. Since AB is a diameter, extending it beyond B would place P somewhere along that line. Given that PB is 1, and OB is also 1, maybe P is positioned such that BP = 1. So if O is the midpoint of AB, then AB has length 2 units (since OA and OB are each 1). But if P is on the extension beyond B, then OP would be OB + BP = 1 + 1 = 2 units. Wait, but how does that fit with the rest?

Also, PC is a tangent to the circle at point C. The tangent PC should satisfy the property that OC is perpendicular to PC. That's one of the given predicates: Perpendicular(Line(O,C), Line(P,C)). So triangle OCP is a right triangle with right angle at C.

So, we need to find the length of PC. Let's think about coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates could help here. Let me set up a coordinate system where O is at the origin (0,0). Since AB is a diameter, and O is the midpoint, let's put A at (-1, 0) and B at (1, 0). Because OA and OB are both 1 unit. Now, point P is on the extended line AB beyond B, so its x-coordinate would be greater than 1. Since PB = 1, and B is at (1,0), moving 1 unit further along AB (which is the x-axis) would place P at (2, 0). Wait, because from B at (1,0), adding 1 unit in the same direction (positive x-direction) gives P at (2,0).

Now, point C is on the circle, and PC is tangent to the circle at C. The tangent line PC touches the circle only at C, so by the tangent-secant theorem, the square of the length of the tangent segment PC is equal to the power of point P with respect to the circle. The formula for the power of a point P outside a circle is |PO|² - r², where r is the radius. Here, the radius of the circle is 1 (since OA=1). So PO is the distance from P to O. Since O is at (0,0) and P is at (2,0), PO is 2 units. Therefore, the power of P is 2² - 1² = 4 - 1 = 3. Hence, PC² = 3, so PC = √3. That would make the answer B.

Wait, but let me confirm if my coordinate setup is correct. Let me check again. Points A(-1,0), B(1,0), O(0,0). Point P is at (2,0). The circle has equation x² + y² = 1. The tangent from P(2,0) to the circle. The tangent points C can be found using the tangent formula. Alternatively, since PC is tangent at C, then OC is perpendicular to PC. So vector OC is from O(0,0) to C(x,y), and vector PC is from P(2,0) to C(x,y). Their dot product should be zero.

Let me compute that. Vector OC is (x, y). Vector PC is (x - 2, y - 0) = (x - 2, y). Their dot product is x*(x - 2) + y*y = x² - 2x + y². But since C lies on the circle, x² + y² = 1. Substituting that into the dot product expression gives 1 - 2x = 0 → x = 1/2. So the x-coordinate of point C is 1/2. Then, substituting back into the circle equation: (1/2)^2 + y^2 = 1 → 1/4 + y² = 1 → y² = 3/4 → y = ±√3/2. So point C is (1/2, √3/2) or (1/2, -√3/2). Either way, the distance PC can be computed.

Take C as (1/2, √3/2). Then PC is the distance between (2,0) and (1/2, √3/2). Using distance formula: sqrt[(2 - 1/2)^2 + (0 - √3/2)^2] = sqrt[(3/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2] = sqrt[9/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[12/4] = sqrt(3). So yes, PC is √3. So the answer should be B.

Alternatively, using the power of a point method: Power of P = PO² - r² = 2² - 1² = 3, so PC = sqrt(3). This confirms the result. So the correct answer is B.
