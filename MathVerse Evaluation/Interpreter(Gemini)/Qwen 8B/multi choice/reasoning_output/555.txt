MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a unit circle, and an acute angle θ formed by a radius and the x-axis. We need to find which two expressions are opposites of cosθ. The options are A through D.

First, I remember that in the unit circle, cosine corresponds to the x-coordinate of a point at angle θ. Since θ is acute, it's between 0 and π/2 radians. Now, the question asks for expressions that are opposite (negative) of cosθ. So, we need to find which of these trigonometric expressions evaluate to -cosθ.

Let me recall some trigonometric identities. For example, cos(π + θ) would be -cosθ because adding π to θ reflects the angle to the third quadrant where cosine is negative. Similarly, cos(π - θ) would be -cosθ since π - θ is in the second quadrant where cosine is also negative. Wait, but wait—let me check each option carefully.

Option A: cos(π + θ). Using the identity cos(π + α) = -cosα. So if α is θ, then yes, this becomes -cosθ. That's one candidate.

Option B: cos(π/2 - θ). Hmm, that's equivalent to sinθ, right? Because cos(π/2 - θ) = sinθ. So this is positive sinθ, which isn't directly opposite to cosθ unless there's a relation between sinθ and cosθ here. But since θ is acute, sinθ is positive, so this isn't negative of cosθ. So maybe not B.

Option C: cos(π - θ). Let's think. π - θ would be in the second quadrant. Cosine there is negative. The identity for cos(π - θ) is -cosθ. Yes, because cos(π - θ) = -cosθ. So that's another expression that equals -cosθ. So C is another candidate.

Option D: cos(2π - θ). Let's see. 2π - θ is equivalent to -θ in terms of periodicity. Cosine is even, so cos(-θ) = cosθ. But 2π - θ is co-terminal with -θ, so cos(2π - θ) = cosθ. Therefore, this is just cosθ, not its opposite. So D is not correct.

Wait, but the question says "Which two of the following expressions are OPPOSITE of cos(theta)". So looking back, A and C both give -cosθ. Let me confirm again.

For A: π + θ. So the angle is in the third quadrant. The reference angle is θ, so the cosine there is -cosθ. Correct.

For C: π - θ. This places the angle in the second quadrant. The reference angle is θ, so cosine is negative, hence -cosθ. Correct.

So the two correct answers should be A and C. However, looking at the options given, the choices are A, B, C, D. The answer requires choosing two. But the user instruction says "Choose 2 answers" and the answer choices are A-D. So the correct options are A and C.

But wait, let me check again. What about option D: cos(2π - θ). As mentioned earlier, 2π - θ is same as -θ, so cos(2π - θ) = cosθ. Hence, not opposite. Option B is cos(π/2 - θ) which is sinθ, not opposite. So the opposites are A and C. 

Therefore, the answer should be A and C. Looking at the options, the answer choices are A, B, C, D. So selecting A and C. But the user has to choose two answers. However, the way the question is phrased, they may expect multiple letters. But according to the instructions, the user needs to pick two options. So the correct choices are A and C. So the answer is A and C. But the system requires me to output one of the four letters. Wait, no—the original problem says "Choose 2 answers", but the assistant is supposed to select the correct ones. But the way the answer is presented here, perhaps the options are A, B, C, D. But the user might have intended that the correct answers are A and C. However, the problem states "which two of the following expressions are opposite...", so the answer is A and C. Thus, the correct choices are A and C. Therefore, the Final Answer should be A and C. However, the system requires me to select one of the options. Wait, no, the user wants me to select two answers. But the way the answer is expected here is to list them as separate letters. But according to the initial instructions, the user expects me to provide the answer as one of the four options. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says "Choose 2 answers" but the answer choices are labeled A to D. So the user probably expects that two of the options are correct. So in the original problem, the correct answers would be A and C. So in the answer, I need to select both A and C. But how does the system accept multiple answers? The user's instructions say "select the correct answer choice"—but the problem says "choose 2 answers". Maybe the original problem allows multiple selections. But given that the answer format requires ending with exactly one letter, perhaps the correct answer is A and C. However, the user might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Let me recheck the options again.

Original answer choices:

A: cos(π+θ)

B: cos(π/2−θ)

C: cos(π−θ)

D: cos(2π−θ)

So the correct answers are A and C. Therefore, the correct options are A and C. So the answer should be A and C. But the user's instructions require me to end with exactly one of the four letters. Wait, but that's conflicting. Unless the problem actually had multiple correct answers, but the user's instructions here might have a typo. Wait, perhaps the actual question expects two answers, but the way the answer is formatted here requires selecting two. However, the user's final instruction says to end with exactly one of the four letters. This seems contradictory. But assuming that the original problem allows multiple answers, but the user expects us to select both, but the system here only allows one answer per box. Hmm, perhaps the original problem's answer is A and C, but the system requires me to choose two letters. However, the user's instruction says "provide a complete step-by-step solution... then select the correct answer choice." So perhaps the correct answer is both A and C. But how to represent that? The original problem might have had options where multiple are correct. However, the way the user set up the answer choices, perhaps the correct answers are A and C. So the Final Answer should be A and C. But given the constraints, I need to output one letter. Wait, no, the user said "Choose 2 answers" and the answer choices are A-D. So in the problem, the answer is A and C. So the correct answer is A and C. But in the required output, I can only write one letter. This seems like a contradiction. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and C, so the answer is both A and C. But the system requires me to end with exactly one of the four letters. Maybe the user intended that the answer is A and C, but the system allows only one selection. This is confusing. However, given that the original problem likely expects two answers, but the answer format here is limited, perhaps there's an error. But proceeding with the knowledge that the correct answers are A and C, the answer should be A and C. However, in the absence of being able to select two, perhaps the user intended that the answer is A and C. So the correct options are A and C. Therefore, I'll proceed with that.
