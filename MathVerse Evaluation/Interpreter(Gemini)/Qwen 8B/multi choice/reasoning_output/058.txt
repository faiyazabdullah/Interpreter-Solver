MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have points A, B, C, D, E with certain lines and angles given. The main goal is to find the measure of angle D, which I assume refers to angle at point D. Let me parse the given information carefully.

First, the predicates mention that Line AB is parallel to Line CD. Also, there's a right angle at E for angle CED, so that's 90 degrees. Then angle AEC is 35 degrees. There's also some info about Triangle CDE being a right triangle, since angle CED is 90 degrees. Additionally, Point E lies on lines AB, CE, and DE. Wait, so E is a common point where lines AB, CE, and DE meet? That suggests that E is the intersection point of AB and CE and DE. But since AB is parallel to CD, maybe there's something about transversals here?

Let me sketch mentally. Points C and D form part of line CD, which is parallel to AB. Point E is somewhere such that lines CE and DE are connected, forming triangle CDE, which is right-angled at E. Also, angle AEC is 35 degrees. Since E is on AB, that means line CE intersects AB at E. So CE is a transversal cutting the parallel lines AB and CD. 

Given that AB || CD, and CE is a transversal intersecting them. The angle at E between CE and AB is angle AEC, which is 35 degrees. Because AB || CD, the corresponding angles should be equal. Wait, but CE is a transversal, so the angle formed with AB would correspond to an angle on CD. However, since CD is parallel to AB, and CE meets them, maybe there's a relationship between angles here.

But wait, angle CED is 90 degrees. So in triangle CDE, which is right-angled at E, angle at E is 90 degrees. Then angle at C (angle ECD) and angle at D (angle CDE) must add up to 90 degrees because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180. Wait, but we also know that angle AEC is 35 degrees. How does that relate?

Since E is on AB, and CE is a line from C to E on AB. So angle AEC is formed at E between AE and EC. Let me think about vertical angles or alternate interior angles. Since AB || CD, and CE is a transversal, the angle between CE and AB (which is angle AEC) should be equal to the angle between CE and CD on the other side. Wait, but CD is parallel to AB, so if CE crosses them, then the alternate interior angles would be equal. But angle AEC is 35 degrees, so perhaps angle ECD (at point C between EC and CD) is also 35 degrees? Wait, but angle ECD is part of triangle CDE. Let me check.

In triangle CDE, right-angled at E, angles at C and D must add up to 90 degrees. Also, it's given that angle ECD equals angle AEC, which is 35 degrees. Therefore, angle ECD is 35 degrees. So then angle CDE (the angle at D) would be 90 - 35 = 55 degrees. Wait, but the question asks for the size of angle D. Is angle D referring to angle CDE? If yes, then 55 degrees. But looking at the options, B is 55. But let me make sure.

Wait, let me confirm. In triangle CDE, angle at C is angle ECD = 35 degrees, angle at E is 90 degrees, so angle at D (angle CDE) is 180 - 35 - 90 = 55 degrees. So angle D is 55 degrees. Hence, the answer would be B.

But wait, another possibility: could angle D refer to another angle? For example, if there's another angle labeled D. But according to the given, the points are A, B, C, D, E. The lines mentioned are AB, CD, CE, DE, and others. The triangle is CDE, so angle D would be angle CDE. So yes, that's 55 degrees. So the answer should be B:55°.

Alternatively, maybe there's more to consider. Let me check again. Given that AB is parallel to CD, and angle AEC is 35 degrees. Since AB || CD, and CE is a transversal, then angle AEC (on AB) and angle ECD (on CD) are alternate interior angles. Therefore, they should be equal. Which confirms angle ECD is 35 degrees. Thus, in triangle CDE, angle at C is 35°, right angle at E, so angle at D is 55°, hence answer B.
