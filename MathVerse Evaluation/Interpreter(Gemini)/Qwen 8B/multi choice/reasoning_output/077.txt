MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So the question says that angle 1 equals angle 3, angle 2 is 60 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle 4. The given predicates mention that lines m and n are parallel. Hmm, okay. Let me visualize this. Maybe it's a diagram with two parallel lines cut by a transversal? Or maybe there's a triangle involved?

First, I should recall some basic geometry concepts. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary. Also, the sum of angles around a point is 360 degrees, and in a triangle, the sum is 180 degrees.

Wait, the problem mentions four angles: 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since there are two parallel lines, perhaps these angles are formed by a transversal intersecting them. Let me sketch mentally: imagine two horizontal parallel lines, m and n, with a transversal crossing them. That would form eight angles, but maybe here they're referring to specific ones. Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle with one side being a transversal?

But the problem states angle 1 equals angle 3. If lines m and n are parallel, and there's a transversal creating angles, then maybe angles 1 and 3 are alternate interior angles? Or corresponding? Wait, if angle 1 and angle 3 are equal, that suggests they could be either alternate interior or corresponding angles. But without seeing the diagram, I have to make assumptions based on standard configurations.

Also, angle 2 is given as 60 degrees. Let's think about how angles relate. Suppose angle 2 is part of a triangle or a pair of lines. For example, if there's a triangle where angle 2 is one of the angles, and other angles relate to the parallel lines.

Alternatively, maybe it's a case where two parallel lines are intersected by two transversals, forming a sort of 'Z' shape or 'F' shape. In such cases, certain angles are equal. For instance, if angle 2 is at the intersection of one transversal, and angle 1 and 3 are on the other transversal.

Wait, another thought: if lines m and n are parallel, and there's a transversal creating angles 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's assume that angle 2 is adjacent to angle 1 or 3. Let me try to assign positions.

Let me consider that angle 2 is on one of the parallel lines. For example, suppose there's a transversal cutting line m, creating angle 2 and another angle. Then another transversal cuts line n, creating angles 1 and 3. Wait, but angle 1 equals angle 3. So if those are alternate interior angles, they'd be equal because the lines are parallel. That fits. So maybe angle 2 is an exterior angle?

Alternatively, perhaps angles 1 and 3 are vertical angles? But vertical angles are always equal, so that's possible. However, the presence of angle 2 being 60 degrees complicates things. Let's think of a common scenario where two parallel lines are cut by two transversals, forming several angles. 

Another possibility: there's a triangle formed by the two parallel lines and a transversal. For instance, if line m is horizontal, line n is parallel, and a transversal crosses both, forming a triangle with angles 1, 2, and 3. Wait, but angle 1 and 3 are equal, so maybe it's an isosceles triangle? But angle 2 is 60 degrees. If angle 2 is the vertex angle, then the base angles would be equal. But that's just speculation.

Alternatively, considering that angle 2 is 60 degrees, and angles 1 and 3 are equal. Let's say angles 1 and 3 are same-side interior angles, which would be supplementary. But since they are equal, each would be 90 degrees. But that contradicts unless angle 2 is something else. Wait, maybe angle 2 is an exterior angle?

Wait, let's take a more systematic approach. Since lines m and n are parallel, and assuming that angles 1, 2, 3, 4 are formed by a transversal. Let me label them properly. Imagine two parallel lines m and n, with a transversal that intersects line m at points creating angles 1 and 2, and intersects line n at points creating angles 3 and 4. Wait, but that's too vague. Maybe angles 1 and 2 are on line m, and angles 3 and 4 on line n? Not sure.

Alternatively, think of a 'Z' shape. If lines m and n are parallel, and there's a transversal making a Z, then the top left angle (say angle 1) and bottom right angle (angle 3) are equal. These are alternate interior angles. So angle 1 = angle 3. Then angle 2 could be another angle in the same configuration. Wait, if angle 2 is adjacent to angle 1, then maybe angle 2 is supplementary to angle 1. But angle 2 is given as 60 degrees. So angle 1 + angle 2 = 180 degrees? If that's the case, then angle 1 would be 120 degrees. But then angle 3 is also 120 degrees. Now, what about angle 4? Depending on its position, maybe it's vertical to angle 2 or something else.

Wait, let me think again. If lines m and n are parallel, and a transversal creates angles 1, 2, 3, 4. Let's say the transversal intersects line m at point A, creating angle 1 and angle 2. Then intersects line n at point B, creating angle 3 and angle 4. If angle 1 and angle 3 are equal (alternate interior angles), then angle 1 = angle 3. Angle 2 and angle 4 could be corresponding angles, so angle 2 = angle 4. Wait, but angle 2 is given as 60 degrees, so angle 4 would be 60 degrees. But that would make answer A. But wait, maybe angle 4 is different?

Wait, but maybe angle 2 is not corresponding to angle 4. Let me clarify. If the transversal crosses line m at point A, forming angle 1 (at the top) and angle 2 (at the bottom). Then crosses line n at point B, forming angle 3 (top) and angle 4 (bottom). So angle 1 and angle 3 are alternate interior angles (equal). Angle 2 and angle 4 are corresponding angles (equal). Therefore, if angle 2 is 60 degrees, then angle 4 is also 60 degrees. But that would make answer A. However, the options include 60° as option A. But wait, maybe the diagram isn't set up like that. What if angle 4 is a different angle?

Alternatively, maybe angle 2 is a vertical angle with another angle. Wait, if angle 2 is on line m, then its vertical angle would be another angle at the same intersection. But if lines m and n are parallel, then maybe there's another transversal? Or perhaps angle 4 is on line n, adjacent to angle 3. So angle 2 and angle 4 are supplementary? Because they might be consecutive interior angles.

Wait, let me try again. Suppose we have two parallel lines, m and n. A transversal cuts them, forming angles. Let me name the angles. At the intersection of the transversal with line m, we have angles 1 and 2. At the intersection with line n, angles 3 and 4. If angle 1 is equal to angle 3 (because they are alternate interior angles), then angle 1 = angle 3. Angle 2 and angle 4 would be corresponding angles, hence equal. But angle 2 is given as 60°, so angle 4 would be 60°, making answer A. But maybe the diagram shows a different arrangement?

Wait, another possibility: angle 2 is an exterior angle. For example, if the transversal forms angles where angle 2 is outside the parallel lines. Then angle 2 could be an exterior angle, and angle 4 could be an interior angle. But without the diagram, it's hard to tell. However, the problem states angle 1 = angle 3, angle 2 = 60°, and asks for angle 4. Let me check if there's another way.

Suppose there's a triangle formed by the two parallel lines and a transversal. For example, imagine triangle ABC where AB is parallel to CD, and AC is a transversal. Wait, this is getting too vague. Let me think of a different approach.

Since angle 1 = angle 3, and angle 2 is 60°, maybe these angles are part of a triangle. For example, if angle 1 and angle 3 are two angles in a triangle, and angle 2 is the third. But then angle 1 + angle 2 + angle 3 = 180. Given that angle 1 = angle 3, then 2*angle1 + 60 = 180 → 2*angle1 = 120 → angle1=60. So angle1=angle3=60°, then angle4...? Not sure yet.

Wait, but where does angle4 come into play? If angle4 is another angle in the same triangle? Or maybe it's an external angle. For example, if angle4 is an exterior angle to the triangle, then it equals the sum of the remote interior angles. If angle4 is an exterior angle at the vertex where angle2 is, then angle4 = angle1 + angle3. But angle1 and angle3 are both 60°, so angle4 would be 120°, which is option C. But that depends on the configuration.

So here's a conflict between possibilities. If the setup involves a triangle with angles 1, 2, 3, then angle4 as an exterior angle would be 120°, leading to answer C. But earlier thinking suggested angle4 could be 60°, answer A. Which one is correct?

I need to reconcile this. Let me consider the possibility that the angles are part of a transversal with parallel lines. Suppose lines m and n are parallel, and there are two transversals creating angles 1, 2, 3, 4. For example, imagine a 'Z' shape with two transversals. Wait, perhaps angle 2 is a vertical angle with another angle, and angle 4 is supplementary to angle2.

Alternatively, let's use the fact that angle1 = angle3 and angle2 = 60°, and that lines m and n are parallel. Let's suppose that angles 1 and 3 are alternate interior angles, so they are equal. Then, if angle2 is a corresponding angle to angle4, then angle4 would equal angle2, which is 60°, making answer A. But if angle4 is a consecutive interior angle with angle2, then they would be supplementary, so angle4 = 180 - 60 = 120°, making answer C. 

Which scenario is more likely? Well, depending on where angle4 is located. Without the diagram, it's ambiguous, but often in such problems, if angle2 is given as 60°, and angle4 is opposite or supplementary, the answer might be 120°. However, I need to verify.

Wait, another idea: if lines m and n are parallel, and there's a triangle formed by a transversal. Suppose angle2 is one angle of the triangle, and angles1 and 3 are other angles. But since lines are parallel, maybe there's some relationship. For example, if a transversal creates angles that are parts of a triangle. Let me think.

Imagine a triangle where one side is a transversal intersecting parallel lines. For example, line m is horizontal, line n is parallel, and a transversal slants upwards, forming a triangle with the two parallel lines. In this case, angle2 could be an angle of the triangle, and angles1 and 3 could be other angles. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, consider a trapezoid with bases m and n (parallel sides), and legs as transversals. The angles at the bases could be related. But again, without knowing the specific configuration, it's challenging.

Wait, maybe I should consider that angle1 and angle3 are vertical angles. If they are vertical angles, then they are equal, which is given. Then angle2 is adjacent to angle1, so they form a linear pair. Thus, angle1 + angle2 = 180°, so angle1 = 180 - 60 = 120°, and angle3 is also 120°. Then angle4 could be vertically opposite to angle2, so angle4 = angle2 = 60°, making answer A. But that's conflicting with previous thoughts.

Alternatively, if angle4 is supplementary to angle3, then angle4 = 180 - 120 = 60°, again answer A. But if angle4 is part of a different relationship...

Wait, this seems inconsistent. Let me try to structure this logically. Given that lines m and n are parallel, and angles 1 and 3 are equal. Angle 2 is 60°. Need to find angle4.

Assuming that angles 1 and 3 are alternate interior angles due to parallel lines, so they are equal. Let's assume that angle2 is a corresponding angle to angle4, making them equal. Hence, angle4 = 60°, answer A. But if angle4 is a consecutive interior angle with angle2, then they add up to 180°, so angle4 = 120°, answer C.

To decide between these, I need to know the position of angle4 relative to the other angles. But without the diagram, it's tricky. However, in many standard problems, when you have two parallel lines and a transversal, the angles formed can be categorized as corresponding, alternate interior, or consecutive interior. If angle2 is a corresponding angle to angle4, then answer A. If it's consecutive, answer C.

Another approach: let's look at the total sum of angles around a point. If angle2 is 60°, and it's adjacent to angle1, then angle1 = 120°, as before. Then, angle3 is also 120°. Now, if angle4 is a vertical angle to angle2, then it's 60°, answer A. If angle4 is a vertical angle to angle1, then it's 120°, answer C. But which is it?

Wait, perhaps angle4 is on the other side of line n. For example, if angle2 is on line m, and angle4 is on line n, then they could be corresponding angles. So angle4 would equal angle2, 60°, answer A. But if angle4 is a consecutive interior angle with angle2, then angle4 would be 120°, answer C.

Given that the problem gives angle1 = angle3, and angle2 = 60°, I think the most probable scenario is that angle1 and angle3 are alternate interior angles, making them equal. Then, angle2 and angle4 are corresponding angles, making them equal. So angle4 = 60°, answer A. However, another possibility is that angle4 is supplementary to angle2, making it 120°, answer C.

Hmm, this is confusing. To resolve this, maybe looking at the sum of angles in a triangle. Suppose angles 1, 2, and 3 are part of a triangle. Since angle1 = angle3, then 2*(angle1) + angle2 = 180. With angle2 = 60°, then angle1 = (180 - 60)/2 = 60°, so angle1 = angle3 = 60°, and angle4 would be an external angle. If angle4 is an external angle, it equals the sum of the remote interior angles, which would be angle1 + angle3 = 60 + 60 = 120°, making angle4 = 120°, answer C. This scenario fits if angle4 is an external angle.

But why would angle4 be an external angle? If the diagram has a triangle with vertices on the parallel lines, then angle4 could be an external angle. Alternatively, if there's a transversal forming a triangle with the parallel lines.

This suggests that answer C is possible. However, without seeing the diagram, it's ambiguous. But given the options, and the fact that angle1 = angle3, angle2 = 60°, and needing to find angle4, the answer could be either 60° or 120°, depending on the configuration.

Wait, let me think of another way. If lines m and n are parallel, and there's a transversal creating angles 1, 2, 3, 4. Assume that angle2 is at the intersection of the transversal with line m, and angle4 is at the intersection with line n. If angle1 and angle3 are alternate interior angles, then angle1 = angle3. Angle2 and angle4 would be corresponding angles, so angle4 = angle2 = 60°, answer A. But if angle2 is an exterior angle and angle4 is an interior angle, then they are supplementary, giving angle4 = 120°, answer C.

But which is more likely? In many textbooks, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are equal. So if angle2 is on one line, angle4 is on the other, and they correspond, then angle4 = 60°. But sometimes, depending on how the transversal is drawn, angle2 could be a consecutive interior angle with angle4, making them supplementary.

Without the diagram, I need to rely on typical problem setups. Often, problems involving parallel lines and transversals focus on corresponding or alternate interior angles. If angle2 is given as 60°, and angle4 is its corresponding angle, then answer A. But if it's a consecutive interior angle, answer C.

However, since angle1 = angle3, and those are likely alternate interior angles, then angle1 and angle3 are equal. This implies that the transversal creates angles with the parallel lines, and the other angles (like angle2 and angle4) may be corresponding or consecutive. 

Wait, if angle2 is an exterior angle, then its corresponding angle (angle4) would be equal. If angle2 is an interior angle, then its consecutive angle (angle4) would be supplementary. 

But how do we determine whether angle2 is interior or exterior? It depends on where it's placed. If the transversal intersects line m, then angle2 could be either interior or exterior. If angle2 is on the same side as the other angles, it might be an interior angle. 

In this case, since angle1 and angle3 are equal (and thus alternate interior angles), angle2 is likely an exterior angle. So angle2 and angle4 would be corresponding angles, making them equal. Thus, angle4 = 60°, answer A. 

But another perspective: if the angles are arranged such that angle2 and angle4 are on the same side of the transversal, they would be consecutive interior angles, thus supplementary. So angle4 = 180 - 60 = 120°, answer C. 

Now I'm really torn. How to choose between A and C?

Maybe the key lies in the fact that angle1 = angle3. If angle1 and angle3 are alternate interior angles, then the transversal creates them. In that case, the angles adjacent to angle2 would be supplementary to angle1 and angle3. 

For example, if angle2 is adjacent to angle1, then angle1 + angle2 = 180°, so angle1 = 120°, making angle3 = 120°. Then, angle4 would be a corresponding angle to angle2, making it 60°, or a consecutive interior angle, making it 120°. 

Wait, if angle2 is 60°, and angle1 is 120°, then angle4 could be either 60° or 120°, depending on its position. 

If angle4 is a corresponding angle to angle2, then it's 60°, answer A. If it's a consecutive interior angle with angle2, then 120°, answer C. 

But how to determine which? Maybe by considering that angle4 is supplementary to angle3. Since angle3 is 120°, then angle4 would be 60° if they are supplementary. Wait, no: consecutive interior angles are supplementary. So if angle3 and angle4 are consecutive interior angles, then angle3 + angle4 = 180°, so angle4 = 60°. But angle3 is 120°, so angle4 would be 60°, which is answer A. 

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier thought. Let me re-express:

If lines m and n are parallel, and a transversal intersects them, forming angles. Let's say the transversal intersects line m at point A, creating angles 1 and 2. It intersects line n at point B, creating angles 3 and 4. 

If angle1 and angle3 are alternate interior angles, then they are equal. Let's assume angle1 = angle3 = x. 

At point A, angle1 and angle2 are supplementary (since they are adjacent along line m). So x + angle2 = 180°. Given angle2 = 60°, then x = 120°, so angle1 = angle3 = 120°. 

Now, at point B, angles 3 and 4 are supplementary if they are adjacent along line n. Wait, angle3 is at point B, so it's adjacent to angle4. So angle3 + angle4 = 180°, since they are adjacent along line n. Since angle3 is 120°, then angle4 = 60°, answer A. 

Ah! So angle4 is adjacent to angle3 along line n, making them supplementary. Thus, angle4 = 180 - 120 = 60°, answer A. 

This aligns with the first scenario where angle4 is supplementary to angle3, giving 60°. 

But earlier, I considered angle4 as corresponding to angle2, which would also give 60°, but that's the same result. 

Therefore, the correct answer should be A. But why did I previously think of 120°? Because of confusion between different scenarios. 

Thus, the correct answer is A: 60°. But wait, let me confirm once more. 

If angle1 and angle3 are alternate interior angles (each 120°), then angle2 is 60°, and angle4 is supplementary to angle3 (since they are adjacent along line n), making angle4 = 60°. Yes, that makes sense. 

Therefore, the answer should be A.
