MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points O, A, B, C. The given conditions say that OA equals OB equals OC, so O is equidistant from A, B, and C. That suggests that O is the center of a circle passing through A, B, and C. Also, there's a triangle ABC, and angle ACB is 30 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle AOB.

First, since OA, OB, and OC are radii of the same circle, points A, B, and C lie on a circle centered at O. Therefore, triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle with center O. Now, angle ACB is given as 30 degrees. In circle theorems, there's something about inscribed angles and central angles. Remember, the central angle subtended by an arc is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.

So, angle ACB is an inscribed angle. Let me think. The arc that it subtends would be arc AB. Wait, because point C is opposite the arc AB. So the measure of angle ACB is half the measure of the central angle AOB. Because the central angle over the same arc AB would be twice the inscribed angle. 

Given angle ACB is 30 degrees, so the central angle AOB should be 2 times 30, which is 60 degrees. Therefore, angle AOB is 60 degrees. That seems straightforward. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.

Wait, another thought: maybe I need to consider triangle ABC and other angles? Let me check again. Since O is the center, OA=OB=OC. So triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle with OA=OB. Similarly for other triangles. However, the key relationship here is between the inscribed angle and the central angle. 

Yes, angle at the center is twice the inscribed angle. So if angle ACB is 30 degrees, then the central angle AOB is 60 degrees. So the answer should be 60 degrees, which is option C. 

Let me verify once more. Suppose we have points A, B, C on a circle with center O. Then angle ACB is formed by chords CA and CB. The intercepted arc is AB. The central angle for arc AB is angle AOB. By the inscribed angle theorem, angle ACB = ½ angle AOB. Hence, angle AOB = 2 × 30° = 60°. Yep, that checks out. So the answer should be C.
