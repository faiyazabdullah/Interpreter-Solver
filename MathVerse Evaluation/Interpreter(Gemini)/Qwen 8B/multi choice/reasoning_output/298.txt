MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the length of JK, given some points on a line and circles with certain radii. Let me start by understanding the setup.

First, the points A, B, C, D are all on the same line, which is Line AD. Also, there are two circles, J and K. Points J and K are also on Line AD because PointLiesOnLine(J, Line(A,D)) and PointLiesOnLine(K, Line(A,D)). That means J and K are points on the same line where the circles are centered. 

Now, Circle J has a radius of 10 units, as per IsRadiusOf(Line(A,J), Circle(J)) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,J)),10). Similarly, Circle K has a radius of 8 units since IsRadiusOf(Line(K,C), Circle(K)) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(K,C)),8). Wait, but Line(K,C) is a radius? Let me check again. The predicates say IsRadiusOf(Line(K,C), Circle(K)), so that implies that the line segment KC is a radius of circle K. Therefore, the length of KC is 8 units. Similarly, AJ is a radius of circle J, so AJ is 10 units. 

Also, point B lies on both Circle J and Circle K. Because PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(J)) and PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(K)). Similarly, D is on Circle K. So BD is part of the line AD, and maybe there are other relations here. 

We also have BC = 5.4 units. The question asks for JK, the distance between centers J and K on the line AD.

Let me try to visualize the points on line AD. Since all points A, B, C, D are on line AD, and J and K are also on this line. Let me think about the order of these points. 

Since J is on line AD, and AJ is a radius of circle J, so J is located such that AJ = 10 units. Similarly, K is on line AD, and KC is a radius of circle K, so KC = 8 units. But we need to figure out where exactly J and K are placed relative to each other and the other points.

Let me consider coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to points on line AD would make it easier. Let me set up a coordinate system where line AD is the x-axis. Let me assign coordinates to points A, B, C, D, J, K accordingly.

Assume line AD is horizontal. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since J is on line AD and AJ is 10 units, if we assume direction, J could be at (10, 0) if moving from A towards D. However, depending on the position of other points, this may vary. Alternatively, maybe J is somewhere else. Wait, but since B is on both circles J and K, and D is on circle K. Let me think.

First, let's note that B is on circle J. So the distance from B to center J is the radius of circle J, which is 10. Similarly, B is on circle K, so the distance from B to center K is the radius of circle K, which is 8. Also, D is on circle K, so KD = 8 units. 

So, perhaps I should model the positions algebraically. Let me denote the coordinates of points on line AD as follows: Let’s assume line AD is the x-axis. Assign coordinates:

Let’s suppose A is at coordinate 0. Let me define variables for positions of J and K. Let me denote the coordinate of J as x_J and K as x_K. Since they are on line AD, their coordinates are along the x-axis.

But first, we know that AJ = 10. Since A is at 0, then J is at x_J = 0 + 10 = 10, assuming J is to the right of A. Or maybe to the left? Well, depends on the configuration. But given that B is on circle J, and also on circle K, and D is on circle K, perhaps the points are arranged in a particular way.

Alternatively, maybe J is between A and B, or B is between J and something else. Let me try to work through this.

Given that B is on circle J, which has center J and radius 10. So the distance from B to J is 10. Similarly, B is on circle K, so distance from B to K is 8. Also, D is on circle K, so distance from D to K is 8.

Moreover, points A, B, C, D are colinear on line AD. Let me think about the positions of B and C. We know that BC = 5.4 units. Also, C is on line AD, and since KC is a radius of circle K (so KC = 8), so the distance from K to C is 8. 

So, if I can express the positions of B, C, D, J, K in terms of coordinates, maybe I can find the distance between J and K.

Let me proceed step by step.

Let’s fix coordinate system:

Let’s take line AD as the x-axis. Let’s assign coordinates:

Let’s let A be at 0. Let’s denote the coordinate of J as j, and K as k. Both j and k are real numbers representing positions on the x-axis.

Since AJ is a radius of circle J, which is 10 units. So the distance from A (which is at 0) to J (at j) is |j - 0| = |j|. This equals 10, so j = ±10. Depending on direction. Let's assume that J is to the right of A, so j = 10. But we don't know yet; maybe it's to the left. Hmm, but since B is on circle J, and also on circle K, perhaps the positioning depends on other points.

Similarly, for circle K, KC is a radius of 8 units. So the distance from K (coordinate k) to C (coordinate c) is |c - k| = 8. So c = k ± 8.

Additionally, D is on circle K, so distance from D to K is 8. So if D is at coordinate d, then |d - k| = 8. So d = k ± 8.

Also, points A, B, C, D are on line AD. So their coordinates are along the x-axis. Let me denote their coordinates as:

A: 0

B: b

C: c

D: d

All these are points on the x-axis.

Now, since B is on circle J, which has center at j (position j) and radius 10. Therefore, the distance from B to J is |b - j| = 10.

Similarly, B is on circle K, which has center at k and radius 8, so |b - k| = 8.

Also, D is on circle K, so |d - k| = 8.

Also, BC = 5.4, so |c - b| = 5.4.

Moreover, points A, B, C, D are on line AD. So their order could be A --- B --- C --- D or some permutation. But we need to figure out the arrangement.

Let me try to write equations based on the above.

From the previous info:

Equation 1: |b - j| = 10 → b - j = ±10.

Equation 2: |b - k| = 8 → b - k = ±8.

Equation 3: |c - k| = 8 → c - k = ±8.

Equation 4: |d - k| = 8 → d - k = ±8.

Equation 5: |c - b| = 5.4 → c - b = ±5.4.

Also, since all points are on line AD, which includes A, B, C, D. So the order of points on the line can vary. Let me try to find relations between these variables.

But we need more constraints. Let me see if there are other relations.

We also know that points A, B, C, D are on line AD. So, the order could be A---J---... but J is a point on the line. Wait, but J is a point on line AD, so maybe J is one of the points? No, J is the center of circle J. Wait, the problem says Point(J) and Point(K), so J and K are points on line AD. So J and K are just points on the line AD, not necessarily the same as A, B, C, D. So A, B, C, D are four distinct points on line AD, and J and K are two more points on the same line.

So, for example, J could be between A and B, or between B and C, etc. Similarly for K.

But how do we determine the positions?

Let me try to assume some orderings. Let me consider that since B is on both circles J and K, and D is on circle K. Also, C is on line AD and connected to K via KC being a radius. Let me try to imagine possible configurations.

Suppose that J is to the right of A, so j = 10. Then, since B is on circle J, the distance from B to J is 10, so B is either 10 units to the left or right of J. So if J is at 10, then B could be at 0 (which is A) or at 20. But A is already at 0, so if B were at 0, that would coincide with A, but since B is another point, probably not. Hence, B would be at 20. But then, since B is on circle K, which has radius 8, and K is another point on line AD. So the distance from B to K is 8, so K would be at 20 ± 8, i.e., 12 or 28. Also, D is on circle K, so distance from D to K is 8. Let me think.

But then we also have point C, which is on line AD, with BC = 5.4. If B is at 20, then C is 5.4 units away from B. So C could be at 20 + 5.4 = 25.4 or 20 - 5.4 = 14.6. Also, since C is on circle K (since KC is a radius of circle K), which has center K. So if K is at 12 or 28, then the distance from K to C is 8. Let me explore possibilities.

Case 1: Suppose K is at 12. Then, since KC = 8, C is at 12 + 8 = 20 or 12 - 8 = 4. If C is at 20, then BC would be 20 - 20 = 0, which contradicts BC = 5.4. If C is at 4, then BC would be |20 - 4| = 16, which doesn't match 5.4. So this case is invalid.

Case 2: K is at 28. Then, C is at 28 + 8 = 36 or 28 - 8 = 20. If C is at 20, then BC = |20 - 20| = 0 again. Not good. If C is at 36, then BC = |20 - 36| = 16, still not 5.4. So this case also fails.

Hmm, so if J is at 10 and B is at 20, then this leads to inconsistency with C's position. So maybe my assumption that J is at 10 is wrong. Perhaps J is to the left of A?

Wait, if J is to the left of A, then j = -10. Then, B is 10 units away from J, so B would be at -10 + 10 = 0 (same as A) or -10 - 10 = -20. Again, B cannot be at 0 (A), so B would be at -20. Now, B is at -20. Then, since B is on circle K, which has radius 8, so distance from B (-20) to K is 8. Thus, K is at -20 + 8 = -12 or -20 - 8 = -28. 

Then, D is on circle K, so distance from D to K is 8. So D is at K ± 8. Let's consider K at -12 first. Then D is at -12 + 8 = -4 or -12 - 8 = -20. If D is at -4, then D is at -4. If D is at -20, that would be same as B. Not possible. So D is at -4. 

Now, point C is on line AD, and BC = 5.4. B is at -20, so C is at -20 + 5.4 = -14.6 or -20 -5.4 = -25.4. Also, since C is on circle K (KC is a radius of circle K, which is 8 units). Let's check if C is at -14.6 or -25.4. 

K is at -12. So distance from K (-12) to C is |c - (-12)| = |c + 12| = 8. So c + 12 = ±8 → c = -12 + 8 = -4 or c = -12 -8 = -20. Wait, but earlier we thought C was at -14.6 or -25.4. There's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that if K is at -12, then C must be at -4 or -20. But according to BC = 5.4, C is at -14.6 or -25.4. These don't align unless my assumptions are wrong. So this case also seems inconsistent.

Hmm, maybe my initial assumption that J is at 10 or -10 is incorrect. Perhaps the positions aren't directly aligned with A's coordinate? Or maybe the line AD isn't starting at A=0, but I assigned coordinates arbitrarily. Let me think differently.

Alternative approach: Let's use variables without fixing A at 0. Let me denote the positions of points A, B, C, D, J, K on line AD as follows:

Let me call the coordinate of A as 0, as before. Let me let J be at position x, and K be at position y. Then, since AJ is a radius of circle J, which is 10 units, so |x - 0| = 10 → x = ±10. Similarly, for circle K, KC is a radius, so |y - c| = 8, where c is the coordinate of C. Also, D is on circle K, so |y - d| = 8, where d is the coordinate of D.

Points A, B, C, D are on line AD. Let me denote their coordinates as a=0, b, c, d respectively.

We know that BC = |c - b| = 5.4.

Also, B is on circle J: |b - x| = 10.

B is on circle K: |b - y| = 8.

D is on circle K: |d - y| = 8.

So, we have several equations here. Let me try to combine them.

Let me consider possible scenarios for the positions of J and K. Let me assume that J is to the right of A (x = 10). Then, B is either at 10 + 10 = 20 or 10 - 10 = 0. But if B is at 0, that's A, which isn't allowed. So B is at 20. Then, B is at 20. Now, since B is on circle K, which has center y and radius 8, so |20 - y| = 8 → y = 20 ± 8 → y = 28 or 12.

Let me consider both possibilities.

Subcase 1: y = 28. Then, D is on circle K, so |d - 28| = 8 → d = 28 ± 8 → d = 36 or 20. If d = 36, then D is at 36. If d = 20, then D coincides with B, which isn't allowed. So D is at 36.

Now, point C is on line AD. We need to find c such that |c - b| = |c - 20| = 5.4 → c = 20 + 5.4 = 25.4 or 20 - 5.4 = 14.6. Also, since C is on circle K (because KC is a radius of circle K), which has center at 28. So |c - 28| = 8 → c = 28 ± 8 → c = 36 or 20. But from earlier, c is 25.4 or 14.6. None of these match 36 or 20. Contradiction. So this subcase is invalid.

Subcase 2: y = 12. Then, D is on circle K: |d - 12| = 8 → d = 12 ± 8 → d = 20 or 4. If d = 20, then D coincides with B, which is invalid. So d = 4. Now, point C is such that |c - 20| = 5.4 → c = 25.4 or 14.6. Also, since C is on circle K (center at 12, radius 8), so |c - 12| = 8 → c = 20 or 4. Again, none of these match 25.4 or 14.6. Contradiction again. So this scenario is invalid.

Therefore, assuming J is at x = 10 leads to contradictions. Let me try J at x = -10 (left of A).

So J is at -10. Then, B is on circle J: |b - (-10)| = |b + 10| = 10 → b + 10 = ±10 → b = 0 or b = -20. If b = 0, that's point A. Not allowed, so b = -20. So B is at -20.

Then, since B is on circle K: |b - y| = |-20 - y| = 8 → |y + 20| = 8 → y = -20 + 8 = -12 or y = -20 - 8 = -28.

Consider Subcase 1: y = -12. Then, D is on circle K: |d - (-12)| = |d + 12| = 8 → d = -12 + 8 = -4 or -12 -8 = -20. If d = -20, it's same as B, invalid. So d = -4.

Now, point C is such that |c - b| = |c - (-20)| = |c + 20| = 5.4 → c = -20 + 5.4 = -14.6 or -20 -5.4 = -25.4. Also, since C is on circle K (center at -12, radius 8): |c - (-12)| = |c +12| = 8 → c = -12 + 8 = -4 or -12 -8 = -20. But c is either -14.6 or -25.4. Neither of these match -4 or -20. Contradiction again.

Subcase 2: y = -28. Then, D is on circle K: |d - (-28)| = |d + 28| = 8 → d = -28 + 8 = -20 or -28 -8 = -36. If d = -20, same as B, invalid. So d = -36.

Now, point C: |c - (-20)| = 5.4 → c = -20 + 5.4 = -14.6 or -20 -5.4 = -25.4. Check if C is on circle K: |c - (-28)| = |c +28| = 8 → c = -28 + 8 = -20 or -28 -8 = -36. Again, neither -14.6 nor -25.4 matches. Contradiction.

Hmm, this suggests that assuming J is at ±10 (based on AJ = 10) leads to inconsistencies. What's wrong here?

Wait, perhaps my assumption that AJ is 10 implies that J is at distance 10 from A, but maybe J is not aligned with the direction of the line AD? No, because J is on line AD, so it must lie along the line. So AJ is a straight line segment on AD. So the absolute value of the difference in coordinates is 10.

Wait, maybe I missed something. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem states: "the diameters of ⊙J and ⊙K are on the same line with points A, B, C, and D." Wait, does this mean that the diameters themselves are on the line, or that the line containing the diameters is the same line as AD? Probably the latter. So the centers J and K are on line AD, since the diameter of a circle lies on its line. Wait, the diameter is a line segment passing through the center. So the entire line containing the diameter is the same as the line AD. Which we've been assuming. So J and K are on line AD.

But then why are there contradictions in the equations? Perhaps there's an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says that the diameters of the circles J and K are on the same line as points A, B, C, D. So the line containing the diameters is the same as line AD. Therefore, J and K are on line AD, as the centers of the circles. So my previous assumptions hold.

But then why the contradictions? Let me check if there are other possibilities for the positions of points.

Perhaps the points are ordered in a different way. For instance, maybe J is between A and B, or between B and C, etc. Let me try to consider different arrangements.

Let me try to think of the positions of J and K relative to A, B, C, D. Since B is on both circles J and K, and D is on circle K. Also, C is connected to K via KC = 8.

Let me try to consider that K is between C and D, or something like that. Let me attempt to draw a diagram mentally.

Let me assume that the order of points on line AD is A, then J, then B, then C, then K, then D. But this is arbitrary. Let me try to find relations.

Alternatively, since B is on both circles J and K, and D is on circle K, perhaps B and D are on opposite sides of K?

Let me consider that B is to the left of K, and D is to the right of K, so that BK = 8 and DK = 8. So total distance from B to D would be 16. But we also have BC = 5.4. Not sure.

Alternatively, since B is on circle K, then B and D are both at distance 8 from K. So B and D are on a circle around K with radius 8. Hence, BD could be less than or equal to 16 (if they are on opposite ends), or anything depending on their positions.

But we also have BC = 5.4. Let me think about this.

Let me go back to the equations. From earlier, we had:

For B: |b - x| = 10 (where x is position of J)

and |b - y| = 8 (where y is position of K)

And for C: |c - y| = 8 (since KC = 8)

And for D: |d - y| = 8 (since KD = 8)

Also, BC = |c - b| = 5.4.

Let me try to express variables in terms of others.

From the equation for C: c = y ± 8. Similarly, D is at d = y ± 8.

But we also have BC = 5.4, so |c - b| = 5.4.

Let me substitute c = y ± 8 into this:

| (y ± 8) - b | = 5.4 → |y - b ± 8| = 5.4.

But from B's position, we have |b - x| = 10 → b = x ± 10.

So substituting b = x ± 10 into the above:

|y - (x ± 10) ± 8| = 5.4 → |y - x ∓ 10 ± 8| = 5.4.

This gives us expressions involving y and x. But we need more relations.

However, we also have that D is at d = y ± 8. Are there any constraints on D? It's on line AD, but we don't have direct info about its relation to other points except through K.

But we also know that points A, B, C, D are on line AD. So their positions are along the same line, but we don't know the order. Perhaps we can relate them.

Alternatively, maybe there's another relationship. Let me think about the fact that all points A, B, C, D are on line AD. So the positions of these points are ordered in some way. For example, A < B < C < D or some other order.

But without knowing the order, it's hard to tell. However, we can consider that the positions of B and C are related by BC = 5.4.

Let me try to consider that the points are ordered as A, B, C, D. Let me assume that. So A < B < C < D. Then, B is between A and C, and C is between B and D.

In this case, since B is on circle J, which has center J. If J is to the left of B, then AJ = 10. But if A is to the left of B, then J could be to the left of A or between A and B.

Wait, but this is getting too vague. Let me try to find another approach.

Let me recall that in such problems, sometimes the centers J and K are positioned such that the distance between them is the sum or difference of their radii if they're tangent, but since B is common to both circles, the distance between J and K is equal to the difference of radii or sum, depending on whether they are externally or internally tangent. Wait, but since B is a point on both circles, that implies that the distance between J and K is equal to the sum or difference of the radii. Let me check.

The distance between centers J and K is |JK|. For B to lie on both circles, the distance between J and K must satisfy |r_J ± r_K| ≤ |JK|. In our case, since B is a common point, it means that |JK| = r_J ± r_K, depending on if the circles are externally or internally tangent. But wait, if two circles intersect at B, then the distance between centers is less than the sum of radii and greater than the difference. But since B is a single point, it could be that the circles are tangent at B, making |JK| = r_J ± r_K. 

But in our case, since B is on both circles, and the circles have radii 10 and 8. So if they are externally tangent, |JK| = 10 + 8 = 18. If internally tangent, |JK| = 10 - 8 = 2. But we need to determine which case applies.

However, we also have other information, like BC = 5.4 and the position of D on circle K. Let me see.

If the circles are externally tangent, then |JK| = 18. But let's see if this fits with the other data.

Alternatively, if they are internally tangent, |JK| = 2. But then, considering the other data, like BC = 5.4, it's unclear. Let me see if this helps.

But how can we determine if they're externally or internally tangent? Well, since B is a common point, it could be either. But we need more information.

Let me think about the coordinates again, but this time not assuming positions for J and K.

Let me denote:

Let me let the distance between J and K be x, which is what we need to find (JK = x).

We also know that B is on both circles, so the distance between J and K is equal to sqrt(r_J^2 + r_K^2 - 2*r_J*r_K*cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between JB and KB. But since B is a common point, this might not help directly.

Wait, but if we consider triangle JKB, with JB = 10, KB = 8, and JK = x. By the law of cosines:

x² = 10² + 8² - 2*10*8*cos(angle at B).

But we don't know the angle. However, if the circles are tangent, then the angle is 180 degrees or 0 degrees. If they are externally tangent, the angle is 180°, giving x = 10+8=18. If internally tangent, angle is 0°, giving x = 10-8=2. But without knowing the angle, this doesn't help directly. However, we have another piece of information: BC = 5.4.

Let me try to relate this. Let me think about the positions of B, C, and K.

Since C is on circle K, and KC = 8, and BC = 5.4, then the distance between B and C is 5.4, and C is 8 units from K. Let me consider triangle BCK, where BK = 8 (since B is on circle K), KC = 8, and BC = 5.4. So we have a triangle with sides BK = 8, KC = 8, and BC = 5.4. Let me compute the angle at K or something.

Wait, triangle BCK has sides BK = 8, KC = 8, BC = 5.4. So it's an isoceles triangle with BK = KC = 8, base BC = 5.4. Let me calculate the angle at K using the Law of Cosines.

Law of Cosines: BC² = BK² + KC² - 2*BK*KC*cos(angle at K).

Plugging in:

5.4² = 8² + 8² - 2*8*8*cos(angle K)

Calculate:

5.4² = 29.16

8² + 8² = 64 + 64 = 128

So:

29.16 = 128 - 128*cos(angle K)

Rearranged:

128*cos(angle K) = 128 - 29.16 = 98.84

cos(angle K) = 98.84 / 128 ≈ 0.7721875

Thus, angle K ≈ arccos(0.7721875) ≈ 39.7 degrees.

Not sure if this helps directly, but it shows that angle at K is acute. But how does this relate to the rest?

Alternatively, since we know the positions of B, C, and K, perhaps we can find the distance between J and K using other relations.

But I'm stuck here. Let me try to return to the coordinate approach, but this time allowing for general positions.

Let me assume that J is at position x, K is at position y, and the points A, B, C, D are on the line AD. Let me define the coordinates as follows:

Let me set A at 0. Let me denote the coordinates of B as b, C as c, D as d. All on the x-axis.

From the given:

- B is on circle J: |b - x| = 10 → b = x ± 10

- B is on circle K: |b - y| = 8 → b = y ± 8

- C is on circle K: |c - y| = 8 → c = y ± 8

- D is on circle K: |d - y| = 8 → d = y ± 8

- BC = |c - b| = 5.4

Let me try to combine these equations. From B's position, we have:

From B's position on J: b = x ± 10

From B's position on K: b = y ± 8

So combining these, x ± 10 = y ± 8 → x - y = ±8 ∓ 10. Let me consider possible combinations.

Let me consider the signs. Let me assume that the plus sign in both cases: x + 10 = y + 8 → x - y = -2.

Or x + 10 = y - 8 → x - y = -18.

Or x - 10 = y + 8 → x - y = 18.

Or x - 10 = y - 8 → x - y = 2.

So possible differences between x and y are -2, -18, 18, or 2.

Now, also, from C's position: c = y ± 8.

From BC = 5.4: |c - b| = 5.4. Since c = y ± 8 and b = x ± 10, let me substitute:

| (y ± 8) - (x ± 10) | = 5.4 → |y - x ± 8 ∓ 10| = 5.4.

But from earlier, x - y = Δ, where Δ is -2, -18, 18, or 2. Let's substitute Δ = x - y = -(y - x). So y - x = -Δ.

Let me rewrite the expression:

|y - x ± 8 ∓ 10| = | -Δ ± 8 ∓ 10 | = | ±8 ∓ 10 - Δ | = 5.4.

Let me analyze each possible Δ:

Case 1: Δ = -2 → x - y = -2 → y - x = 2

Then, the expression becomes |±8 ∓10 - 2| = 5.4.

Let's evaluate the possibilities for ±8 and ∓10:

Possibility 1: +8 and -10 → |8 - 10 - 2| = |-4| = 4 ≠ 5.4 → No.

Possibility 2: +8 and +10 → |8 + 10 - 2| = |16| = 16 ≠ 5.4 → No.

Possibility 3: -8 and -10 → |-8 -10 - 2| = |-20| = 20 ≠ 5.4 → No.

Possibility 4: -8 and +10 → |-8 + 10 - 2| = |0| = 0 ≠ 5.4 → No.

No valid solutions in this case.

Case 2: Δ = -18 → x - y = -18 → y - x = 18

Expression: |±8 ∓10 - 18| = 5.4.

Evaluate possibilities:

Possibility 1: +8 and -10 → |8 - 10 - 18| = |-20| = 20 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 2: +8 and +10 → |8 + 10 - 18| = |0| = 0 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 3: -8 and -10 → |-8 -10 -18| = |-36| = 36 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 4: -8 and +10 → |-8 +10 -18| = |-16| = 16 ≠ 5.4

No solution here.

Case 3: Δ = 18 → x - y = 18 → y - x = -18

Expression: |±8 ∓10 - (-18)| = |±8 ∓10 + 18| = 5.4

Evaluate:

Possibility 1: +8 and -10 → |8 -10 + 18| = |16| = 16 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 2: +8 and +10 → |8 +10 +18| = |36| = 36 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 3: -8 and -10 → |-8 -10 +18| = |0| = 0 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 4: -8 and +10 → |-8 +10 +18| = |20| = 20 ≠ 5.4

No solution.

Case 4: Δ = 2 → x - y = 2 → y - x = -2

Expression: |±8 ∓10 - (-2)| = |±8 ∓10 + 2| = 5.4

Evaluate:

Possibility 1: +8 and -10 → |8 -10 +2| = |0| = 0 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 2: +8 and +10 → |8 +10 +2| = |20| = 20 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 3: -8 and -10 → |-8 -10 +2| = |-16| = 16 ≠ 5.4

Possibility 4: -8 and +10 → |-8 +10 +2| = |4| = 4 ≠ 5.4

Still no solution. So none of the cases give us 5.4. This suggests there's an error in my assumptions.

Wait, this indicates that there is no solution under these assumptions, which is impossible because the problem exists. Where am I going wrong?

Ah! I assumed that the expressions for c and b are using the same sign for ±. But actually, when we derive c = y ± 8 and b = x ± 10, the signs could be different. Let me reconsider the substitution.

Earlier, I said that for c = y ± 8, and b = x ± 10, but the signs for the ± could be independent. So instead of assuming both are + or -, they could be different.

Let me redo the substitution with this in mind. Let me denote:

From B's position: b = x + 10 or x - 10.

From B's position on K: b = y + 8 or y - 8.

So combining these, x ± 10 = y ± 8. This gives four possibilities:

1. x + 10 = y + 8 → x - y = -2

2. x + 10 = y - 8 → x - y = -18

3. x - 10 = y + 8 → x - y = 18

4. x - 10 = y - 8 → x - y = 2

These are the same as before. Now, for each case, we need to consider the expression for BC = |c - b| = 5.4, where c = y ± 8, and b = x ± 10.

But since c = y ± 8, and b = x ± 10, we can write:

c - b = (y ± 8) - (x ± 10) = (y - x) ± 8 ∓ 10.

So the absolute value |c - b| = |(y - x) ± 8 ∓ 10| = 5.4.

Now, since y - x is known from each case (as -Δ, where Δ is x - y):

Case 1: y - x = 2 → (y - x) = 2

So |2 ± 8 ∓ 10| = 5.4

Let me evaluate all combinations of signs:

Option 1: +8 and -10 → |2 +8 -10| = |0| = 0 → No

Option 2: +8 and +10 → |2 +8 +10| = 20 → No

Option 3: -8 and -10 → |2 -8 -10| = |-16| = 16 → No

Option 4: -8 and +10 → |2 -8 +10| = |4| = 4 → No

No solution.

Case 2: y - x = 18 → |18 ± 8 ∓ 10| = 5.4

Options:

Option 1: +8 and -10 → |18 +8 -10| = |16| = 16 → No

Option 2: +8 and +10 → |18 +8 +10| = 36 → No

Option 3: -8 and -10 → |18 -8 -10| = |0| = 0 → No

Option 4: -8 and +10 → |18 -8 +10| = |20| = 20 → No

No solution.

Case 3: y - x = -18 → | -18 ± 8 ∓ 10 | = 5.4

Options:

Option 1: +8 and -10 → |-18 +8 -10| = |-20| = 20 → No

Option 2: +8 and +10 → |-18 +8 +10| = |0| = 0 → No

Option 3: -8 and -10 → |-18 -8 -10| = |-36| = 36 → No

Option 4: -8 and +10 → |-18 -8 +10| = |-16| = 16 → No

No solution.

Case 4: y - x = -2 → | -2 ± 8 ∓ 10 | = 5.4

Options:

Option 1: +8 and -10 → |-2 +8 -10| = |-4| = 4 → No

Option 2: +8 and +10 → |-2 +8 +10| = |16| = 16 → No

Option 3: -8 and -10 → |-2 -8 -10| = |-20| = 20 → No

Option 4: -8 and +10 → |-2 -8 +10| = |0| = 0 → No

No solution. Still no luck.

This suggests that there's an error in the approach. Perhaps the assumption that c = y ± 8 and b = x ± 10 is missing something? Let me revisit the original predicates.

Original predicates: PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(J)) and PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(K)). So B is on both circles, so the distance from B to J is 10 (radius of J) and from B to K is 8 (radius of K). So yes, |b - x| = 10 and |b - y| = 8. Correct.

PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(K)): So C is on circle K, so |c - y| = 8. Correct.

But what about point D? PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(K)) → |d - y| = 8. Correct.

So the equations are correct. But why is there no solution? This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup or in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the diameters of the circles are on the same line as points A, B, C, D. Does this mean that the line AD contains the diameters, i.e., the line AD is the same as the line containing the diameters, which is true since the centers J and K are on line AD. So no issue there.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the combination of signs? Let me try to consider that when I wrote |c - b| = 5.4, I should consider all possible combinations of signs.

Wait, let me take a different approach. Let me assume that the centers J and K are positioned such that the distance between them is x, and try to find x using the given BC = 5.4.

Since B is on both circles, and C is on circle K, let's consider triangle BCK, where BK = 8 (since B is on circle K), KC = 8 (since C is on circle K), and BC = 5.4. As I calculated earlier, this forms an isosceles triangle with sides 8, 8, 5.4. The height of this triangle can be calculated, and maybe it relates to the position of J.

Let me calculate the height h from K to BC in this triangle. Using Pythagoras:

h = sqrt(8² - (5.4/2)^2) = sqrt(64 - 14.55) = sqrt(49.45) ≈ 7.03.

But how does this help? If I can relate this to the position of J.

Alternatively, since J is on line AD, and B is on circle J, which has radius 10, then the distance from J to B is 10. Let me think about the position of J relative to B and the triangle BCK.

If I can find the distance between J and K, which is what we need, perhaps using the distances from J to B and from K to B, and the distance between J and K.

Let me consider the triangle JKB, where JB = 10, KB = 8, and JK = x. We can use the Law of Cosines here, but we need an angle. However, if we can find the angle between JB and KB, it might be related to the triangle BCK.

But how?

Alternatively, if I can find the coordinates of J and K in relation to B and C.

Let me assume that line AD is the x-axis, and let me place point B at the origin for simplicity. Let me set B at (0, 0). Then, since C is 5.4 units away from B, let me place C at (5.4, 0). Now, since C is on circle K, which has center at K, and KC = 8. So K is somewhere on the x-axis such that the distance from K to C is 8. Let me denote K as (k, 0). Then, the distance from K to C is |k - 5.4| = 8 → k = 5.4 + 8 = 13.4 or k = 5.4 - 8 = -2.6.

So K is at 13.4 or -2.6.

Now, B is on circle K, so the distance from B (0,0) to K is 8. Let me verify:

If K is at 13.4, then distance from B (0) to K (13.4) is 13.4, which is not 8. Contradiction. So this is invalid.

If K is at -2.6, then distance from B (0) to K (-2.6) is 2.6, which is not 8. Also invalid. So this suggests that placing B at (0,0) is not compatible with the conditions. Why? Because B is on both circles J and K, and C is on circle K. So if B is at (0,0), and C is at (5.4, 0), then K must be at distance 8 from both B and C, which is only possible if the intersection of two circles with centers at B and C and radii 8 and 8. The intersection points would be at certain locations, but in this case, the distance between B and C is 5.4, which is less than 16 (sum of radii), so there are two intersection points. Let me calculate the coordinates of K.

Let me set B at (0,0) and C at (5.4, 0). The circle around B with radius 8 has equation x² + y² = 64. The circle around C with radius 8 has equation (x - 5.4)^2 + y² = 64. Subtracting the two equations:

(x - 5.4)^2 + y² - (x² + y²) = 0 → x² - 10.8x + 29.16 - x² = 0 → -10.8x + 29.16 = 0 → x = 29.16 / 10.8 = 2.7.

So x = 2.7. Substituting back into first equation: (2.7)^2 + y² = 64 → 7.29 + y² = 64 → y² = 56.71 → y ≈ ±7.53.

So the possible positions for K are (2.7, ±7.53). But since all points are on line AD, which is the x-axis, K must be on the x-axis. But this calculation shows that K is not on the x-axis, which contradicts the condition that K is on line AD. Hence, this suggests that my assumption of placing B at (0,0) and C at (5.4, 0) is invalid, because it forces K off the x-axis, which is not allowed.

This indicates that the points B, C, and K cannot be collinear on the x-axis with K on the x-axis, unless the triangle BCK is degenerate. But since BC = 5.4 and BK = KC = 8, it's possible only if the triangle is non-degenerate, which requires K to be off the line BC, hence off the x-axis, which contradicts the condition that K is on line AD (the x-axis). This suggests a fundamental contradiction, implying that my initial assumptions are wrong.

Wait, but the problem states that all points A, B, C, D are on line AD, and J and K are also on line AD. So K is on line AD, which is the x-axis. So if B and C are on the x-axis, and K is also on the x-axis, then the triangle BCK is degenerate, meaning that all three points are on the x-axis. But then, for K to be on the x-axis, and BK = 8, KC = 8, and BC = 5.4, this would require that B and C are symmetrically placed around K, or something like that.

Let me try this. Let me assume that K is between B and C, or outside.

Let me suppose that K is between B and C. Then, BK + KC = BC. But BK = 8, KC = 8, so BC = 16, but given BC = 5.4, this is impossible. So K cannot be between B and C.

If K is to the left of B, then BK = distance from K to B is 8, and KC = distance from K to C is 8 + BC = 8 + 5.4 = 13.4. But since K is on line AD, and B and C are on the same line, this would mean that the distance from K to C is 13.4, which is possible. Let me calculate the position.

Let me set B at 0, C at 5.4. Let K be to the left of B, at position -8 (distance from B is 8). Then, distance from K to C is 5.4 - (-8) = 13.4, which is not 8. So this doesn't work.

If K is to the right of C, then distance from K to B is BK = 8, and distance from K to C is KC = 8. So let me set K at position x. Then, x - 0 = 8 → x = 8. Then, distance from K to C is |x - 5.4| = |8 - 5.4| = 2.6, which is not 8. Not valid.

If K is to the left of B, but at a position where KC = 8. Let me set K at position x, then:

Distance from K to B: |x - 0| = 8 → x = -8 or 8.

Distance from K to C: |x - 5.4| = 8. Let's check x = -8: |-8 - 5.4| = 13.4 ≠ 8. x = 8: |8 - 5.4| = 2.6 ≠ 8. No good.

If K is to the right of C, then distance from K to C is |x - 5.4| = 8 → x = 5.4 + 8 = 13.4 or x = 5.4 - 8 = -2.6. Let's check distance from K to B (0): |13.4 - 0| = 13.4 ≠ 8, and |-2.6 - 0| = 2.6 ≠ 8. No good.

So it appears that it's impossible to have K on the x-axis such that both BK = 8 and KC = 8, given BC = 5.4. This suggests a contradiction, which implies that there's a mistake in the problem setup, or my understanding of it.

Wait, but the problem says that C is on line AD, and KC is a radius of circle K. So KC = 8. And B is on circle K, so BK = 8. So BK = KC = 8, and BC = 5.4. This forms a triangle with sides 8, 8, 5.4, which is possible, but the problem is that if all points are on the same line, this is only possible if the triangle is degenerate, which it is not. Hence, this suggests that the points B, C, and K are not collinear, but the problem states that all points are on line AD, including K. This is a contradiction.

Wait, but K is on line AD, and B and C are also on line AD. So B, C, and K are all on line AD, which means they are collinear. But then, if BK = 8 and KC = 8, and BC = 5.4, this is only possible if B and C are on opposite sides of K, such that BK + KC = BC. But 8 + 8 = 16, which is not 5.4. Alternatively, if K is between B and C, then BC = BK + KC = 16, which is not 5.4. Or if K is outside the segment BC, then BC = |BK - KC| = |8 - 8| = 0, which is not 5.4. Hence, this is impossible.

This suggests that there's an error in the problem, or perhaps I misinterpreted the predicates.

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement to ensure I didn't miss anything.

Problem statement: "The diameters of ⊙J and ⊙K are on the same line with points A, B, C, and D. Circle J has a radius of 10 units, ⊙K has a radius of 8 units, and BC = 5.4 units. Find JK."

Wait, the phrase "diameters of ⊙J and ⊙K are on the same line with points A, B, C, and D" might mean that the diameters are on the same line as the line containing points A, B, C, D. So the diameters are lines, and they are on the same line as AD. Hence, the centers J and K are on line AD, which we've been assuming. So no error there.

But the contradiction remains: if B, C, and K are on line AD, and BK = 8, KC = 8, then BC must be 0 or 16, but it's given as 5.4. This suggests that there is no solution, which is impossible. Hence, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.

Wait, let me check the predicates again. The problem says:

PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(J))

PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(J))

PointLiesOnCircle(B, Circle(K))

PointLiesOnCircle(D, Circle(K))

So A is on circle J, B is on circle J and K, D is on circle K.

So A is on circle J, which has center J and radius 10. So the distance from A to J is 10.

Similarly, D is on circle K, so distance from D to K is 8.

So, perhaps the points A, B, C, D are not all on the same line, but the line AD contains them, and the diameters of the circles are on the same line as AD. Wait, but the problem says "the diameters of ⊙J and ⊙K are on the same line with points A, B, C, and D". So the line containing the diameters is the same line as the line containing points A, B, C, D. Hence, line AD is the line containing the diameters, so J and K are on line AD.

But then, with the previous contradiction, it's impossible. This suggests that the problem might have a typo, or I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think: perhaps the line AD is not the same as the line containing the diameters? No, the problem says "the diameters of ⊙J and ⊙K are on the same line with points A, B, C, and D", which likely means that the line containing the diameters (i.e., the line passing through J and K) is the same as the line containing points A, B, C, D. So line AD is the same line as the line containing J and K.

But this brings us back to the same contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the line AD is not the same as the line containing J and K, but the diameters are on the same line as the points A, B, C, D. But this would mean that line AD is the same line as the line containing the diameters, so J and K are on AD.

I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, perhaps I should look for another approach.

Let me consider the possibility that the distance between J and K is the sum of the radii minus BC or something. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, since B is on both circles, and we know the radii, maybe the distance between J and K is |10 - 8| = 2 or 10 + 8 = 18, but this doesn't account for BC = 5.4.

Wait, let me think about the positions of J and K. Since B is on both circles, the line connecting J and K passes through B. Because if two circles intersect at B, the line joining their centers passes through the intersection points. So line JK passes through B.

Thus, J, B, K are collinear, with JB = 10, BK = 8. So the distance between J and K is JB + BK = 10 + 8 = 18, or |JB - BK| = 2, depending on the position of B relative to J and K.

If B is between J and K, then JK = JB + BK = 10 + 8 = 18.

If J and K are on the same side of B, then JK = |JB - BK| = 2.

But how does this relate to BC = 5.4?

Let me assume that B is between J and K. So J----B----K, with JB = 10, BK = 8. So JK = 18.

Now, C is on circle K, so KC = 8. So from K, move 8 units to C. If K is at position x, then C is at x + 8 or x - 8. Let me assume that C is in the direction from K away from B. So if B is between J and K, then C could be on the same side as J or on the other side.

Let me assume that C is on the line extending from K away from B. So from K, move 8 units in the direction opposite to B. Let me define coordinates.

Let me set B at 0. Let me set J at -10 (since JB = 10), and K at +8 (since BK = 8). So J is at -10, B at 0, K at 8. Then, C is on circle K, so KC = 8. So C is at 8 + 8 = 16 or 8 - 8 = 0. If C is at 16, then BC = |16 - 0| = 16, which is not 5.4. If C is at 0, it's same as B, which is invalid. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, if C is on the other side of K, but in the direction towards J. So from K at 8, move towards J (which is at -10), so C is at 8 - 8 = 0, again same as B.

No good.

Alternatively, if B is not between J and K. Let's say J and K are on the same side of B. For example, J is at -10, B is at 0, K is at -2 (so that BK = 8? No, distance from B to K is |0 - (-2)| = 2, not 8. To have BK = 8, K would be at -8. So J at -10, B at 0, K at -8. Then, distance from J to K is |-10 - (-8)| = 2, which is |10 - 8| = 2. Now, C is on circle K, so KC = 8. So from K at -8, C is at -8 + 8 = 0 or -8 - 8 = -16. If C is at 0, it's same as B, invalid. If C is at -16, then BC = |0 - (-16)| = 16, not 5.4.

Again, no good.

This suggests that regardless of the configuration, BC cannot be 5.4 if K is on the line AD and KC = 8, and B is on both circles.

This implies that there's a mistake in the problem, or I'm missing a critical insight.

Wait, let me think about the possibility that C is not on the line AD. But the problem says "points A, B, C, and D are on the same line," so C is on line AD. So this is not possible.

At this point, I'm stuck and unable to resolve the contradiction. Given that this is a math problem, there must be a solution, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the beginning.

Let me try to look at the answer choices and see if any of them make sense. The options are 12.6, 14.6, 20.6, 30.6.

If I consider that the distance between J and K is 10 + 8 = 18, but BC is 5.4, which is much smaller. Alternatively, if it's 10 - 8 = 2, but 2 is not among the choices. Or if it's 10 + 8 - 5.4 = 12.6, which is option A. Or 10 + 8 + 5.4 = 23.4, not in choices. Or 10 + 5.4 = 15.4, not in choices. Or 8 + 5.4 = 13.4, not in choices. Or 10 - 5.4 = 4.6, no. 

Wait, the answer choices include 12.6, which is 10 + 2.6, or 8 + 4.6. Not sure. But if I assume that the distance between J and K is 10 + 8 - 5.4 = 12.6, which is option A. This might be the intended answer, even though the reasoning is flawed. Perhaps the problem assumes that the distance between J and K is the sum of radii minus BC, which is 18 - 5.4 = 12.6.

Given that, the answer would be A: 12.6.

But this is purely guesswork. However, since the problem is designed, and given the answer choices, this might be the expected solution.
