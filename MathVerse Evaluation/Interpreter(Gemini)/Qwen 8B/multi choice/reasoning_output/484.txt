====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question mentions there's a curve passing through three points: (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2). Also, it notes that the points (-5,2) is solid and (3,2) is hollow. But wait, the main goal is to find the domain and range of the function represented by this curve. 

Looking at the given predicates, they mention several points lying on different lines. Let me parse those. For example, Point A lies on the x-axis and y-axis? Wait, no—actually, the predicates say Point A lies on Line(x,-axis) and Line(y,-axis)? That doesn't make sense because a single point can't lie on both axes unless it's the origin. Wait, maybe there's a typo. Let me check again. Oh, perhaps the predicates are indicating that each point lies on specific lines. Let me re-express them properly.

Wait, the user wrote:

PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(x,-axis)) – so maybe that means point A lies on the x-axis? Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(y,-axis)) would mean point A lies on the y-axis. But if a point lies on both x-axis and y-axis, it must be the origin (0,0). However, looking at the other points, like B and C. Let me check the rest of the predicates.

For Point B: Lies on Line(x,-axis) and Line(y,-axis)? So same thing—point B would have to be the origin. But then later, there are more specific lines mentioned. For instance, Point A lies on Line(x=-5,y=2)—so that's a vertical line at x=-5 and horizontal line y=2? No, wait, Line(x=-5,y=2) is actually a point, since x=-5 and y=2 defines a single point (-5,2). Wait, but how can a line be defined by x=-5 and y=2? That seems contradictory because a line requires either x or y to vary. Maybe there was a mistake in the predicate names. Alternatively, perhaps the Line(x=-5,y=2) refers to a line where x is -5 and y varies, or vice versa. Wait, that's confusing. Maybe the Line(x=-5,y=2) is meant to represent the line x = -5 and y = 2, which is just the point (-5,2). But that can't be a line. Therefore, there's likely a misunderstanding here. 

Alternatively, perhaps the Line(x=-5,y=2) is intended to be the line that passes through the point (-5,2) and has some slope? Or maybe it's a misinterpretation of the parameters. This part is unclear. However, the next part says PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(x=-1,y=0)), which would imply that point B lies on the line x=-1 and y=0, which is the point (-1,0). Similarly, Point C lies on Line(x=3,y=2), which is the point (3,2). 

So putting this together: Points A, B, and C are located at (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2) respectively. Because Point A lies on the line x=-5, y=2 (which is the point (-5,2)), Point B lies on x=-1, y=0 (the point (-1,0)), and Point C lies on x=3, y=2 (the point (3,2)). 

Therefore, the curve in question passes through these three points. Now, the question asks for the domain and range of the function. Since the curve passes through these three points, we need to figure out what kind of function this could be. 

First, note that two of the points have the same y-coordinate: (-5,2) and (3,2). These are symmetric around x= -1, since (-5 + 3)/2 = -1. Wait, (-5,2) and (3,2) are horizontally aligned at y=2. The third point is (-1,0). So the curve connects these three points. 

Now, considering that the curve goes through these points, what type of function could this be? It could be a quadratic function (parabola), since three points can define a parabola. Let's assume it's a parabola opening upwards or downwards. Let me try to find its equation. 

Let me denote the general form of a quadratic function as y = ax² + bx + c. We can plug in the three points to find a, b, c. 

First, plugging in (-5,2): 
2 = a(-5)^2 + b(-5) + c → 2 = 25a -5b + c. 

Second, plugging in (-1,0):
0 = a(-1)^2 + b(-1) + c → 0 = a - b + c. 

Third, plugging in (3,2):
2 = a(3)^2 + b(3) + c → 2 = 9a + 3b + c. 

So we have three equations:

1. 25a -5b + c = 2  
2. a - b + c = 0  
3. 9a + 3b + c = 2  

We can solve this system of equations. Let's subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

Equation 1 minus Equation 2:  
(25a -5b + c) - (a - b + c) = 2 - 0  
→ 24a -4b = 2 → Simplify by dividing by 2: 12a - 2b = 1. Let's call this equation 4.

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 3:  
(9a +3b +c) - (a - b +c) = 2 - 0  
→ 8a +4b = 2 → Divide by 2: 4a + 2b = 1. Call this equation 5.

Now, we have equations 4 and 5:

Equation 4: 12a - 2b = 1  
Equation 5: 4a + 2b = 1  

Adding equations 4 and 5:  
(12a -2b) + (4a +2b) = 1 + 1  
→ 16a = 2 → a = 2 / 16 = 1/8. 

Substitute a = 1/8 into equation 5:  
4*(1/8) + 2b = 1 → 0.5 + 2b = 1 → 2b = 0.5 → b = 0.25 = 1/4. 

Now, substitute a = 1/8 and b = 1/4 into equation 2:  
a - b + c = 0 → (1/8) - (1/4) + c = 0 → (-1/8) + c = 0 → c = 1/8. 

Thus, the quadratic equation is y = (1/8)x² + (1/4)x + 1/8. 

To simplify, multiply all terms by 8 to eliminate denominators:  
8y = x² + 2x + 1 → x² + 2x +1 = 8y → (x+1)^2 = 8y. 

This is a parabola that opens upward, vertex at (-1, 0), which matches the given point (-1,0). 

Now, the domain of a quadratic function is typically all real numbers unless restricted. However, since the problem states that the curve goes through these three points, and assuming it's a standard parabola, the domain should be all real numbers. However, sometimes problems may consider only the visible portion, but without restrictions, the domain is (-∞, ∞). 

But wait, the question is about the domain and range of the function. The domain is all x-values for which the function is defined. Since it's a parabola extending infinitely, the domain is all real numbers. The range, however, depends on the direction it opens. Since it opens upward, the minimum value is at the vertex (-1, 0). Thus, the range is [0, ∞). 

However, let me confirm. The vertex is at (-1, 0), which is the lowest point. So yes, the range starts at y=0 and increases. Therefore, the domain is (-∞, ∞) and the range is [0, ∞). 

But wait, the problem mentions that (-5,2) is solid and (3,2) is hollow. Does that affect anything? Maybe the curve isn't a full parabola, but perhaps something else? Like a cubic? But three points can define a quadratic, and the given points fit a parabola. Unless there's another constraint. 

Alternatively, could the curve be a semicircle? Let me check. The three points are (-5,2), (-1,0), (3,2). Let's see if they lie on a circle. To find the equation of a circle passing through these three points. 

General equation of a circle: x² + y² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Plugging in each point:

For (-5,2): (-5)^2 + (2)^2 + D*(-5) + E*(2) + F = 0 → 25 +4 -5D +2E +F = 0 → 29 -5D +2E +F = 0 → Equation 1: -5D +2E +F = -29.

For (-1,0): (-1)^2 + 0^2 + D*(-1) + E*0 + F = 0 → 1 - D + F = 0 → Equation 2: -D + F = -1.

For (3,2): 3² + 2² + D*3 + E*2 + F = 0 → 9 +4 +3D +2E +F = 0 → 13 +3D +2E +F = 0 → Equation 3: 3D +2E +F = -13.

Now, we have three equations:

1. -5D +2E +F = -29  
2. -D + F = -1  
3. 3D +2E +F = -13  

Let me solve these equations. From equation 2: F = D -1. Substitute F into equations 1 and 3:

Equation 1 becomes: -5D +2E + (D -1) = -29 → -4D +2E -1 = -29 → -4D +2E = -28 → divide by 2: -2D + E = -14 → Equation 1': E = 2D -14.

Equation 3 becomes: 3D +2E + (D -1) = -13 → 4D +2E -1 = -13 → 4D +2E = -12 → divide by 2: 2D + E = -6 → Equation 3': 2D + E = -6.

Now, from Equation 1' and 3':

From Equation 1': E = 2D -14  
Plug into Equation 3': 2D + (2D -14) = -6 → 4D -14 = -6 → 4D = 8 → D = 2.

Then, E = 2*2 -14 = 4 -14 = -10.

F = D -1 = 2 -1 = 1.

So the equation of the circle is x² + y² + 2x -10y +1 = 0. Let me rearrange it to standard form by completing the squares.

Group x and y terms:

x² + 2x + y² -10y = -1.

Complete the square for x: x² + 2x +1 = (x+1)^2. Subtract 1:  
For y: y² -10y +25 = (y-5)^2. Subtract 25: 

So adding 1 and 25 to both sides:

(x+1)^2 -1 + (y-5)^2 -25 = -1 → (x+1)^2 + (y-5)^2 = 25.

So the circle has center at (-1,5) and radius 5. Check if all three points lie on this circle:

Check (-5,2):

Distance squared from center (-1,5): (-5 +1)^2 + (2 -5)^2 = (-4)^2 + (-3)^2 = 16 +9=25. Yes.

Check (-1,0): distance squared: (-1 +1)^2 + (0 -5)^2 = 0 +25=25. Correct.

Check (3,2): (3 +1)^2 + (2-5)^2 = 16 +9=25. Correct. 

So the three points lie on a circle centered at (-1,5) with radius 5. 

But the problem says there's a curve going through these points. Which one is it? The question didn't specify whether it's a parabola or a circle. However, the initial analysis suggested a quadratic function, but there's also a circle. How do we know which one?

Wait, the problem says "there is a curve". Both a parabola and a circle are curves. However, the term "function" implies that each x-value maps to one y-value. A circle is not a function unless it's split into two functions. But the problem mentions "the function", implying a single-valued function. Hence, the parabola is the correct interpretation, since it's a function, while the circle is not a function (it fails the vertical line test). 

Therefore, the curve is the parabola (x+1)^2 = 8y, which is a function. 

So, returning to domain and range. As discussed earlier, the domain is all real numbers because the parabola extends infinitely left and right. The range is from the vertex y=0 up to infinity, hence [0, ∞).

But wait, the problem mentions that the points (-5,2) and (3,2) are solid and hollow. Could that indicate something about the graph? For example, maybe the curve is only part of the parabola? But the problem states it's a curve going through those three points, so the entire parabola would pass through them. Unless there's a restriction. But the problem doesn't state any restriction. 

Therefore, the domain is all real numbers, written as (-∞, ∞), and the range is [0, ∞). 

But looking back, the answer choices were supposed to be selected from options A-D, but the original message said "No choices found." Hmm. The user might have made a mistake in providing answer choices, but according to the instructions, I'm to provide the answer as per my calculation. 

Since the answer requires selecting from options, but there are none listed, perhaps the expected answer is based on the domain and range. 

Wait, the question says "Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation." So the answer should be Domain: (-∞, ∞), Range: [0, ∞). 

Assuming that the answer choices are labeled A, B, C, D, and the correct answer corresponds to one of them, but since the actual choices aren't given, I'll proceed based on the calculation. 

Given that the domain is all real numbers and the range is from 0 to infinity, the Final Answer would depend on the options provided. Since there are no options, but the user instructed to pick one of A-D, I need to infer. But since I don't have the options, I'll proceed with the conclusion that the domain is (-infty, infty) and range [0, infty). 

But since the user hasn't provided options, perhaps the answer is simply stating the domain and range. However, the instruction says to choose from answer choices, but since there are none, I think the intended answer is based on the parabola's domain and range. 

In that case, the correct answer would be domain: (-∞, ∞), range: [0, ∞). Assuming that one of the options corresponds to this, but without seeing the options, I cannot select. However, the user might have had options like:

A. Domain: (-∞, ∞); Range: [0, ∞)

B. Domain: [-5, 3]; Range: [0, 2]

C. Domain: (-∞, ∞); Range: [0, 2]

D. Domain: [-5, 3]; Range: [0, ∞)

But since I don't know, I'll go with the correct mathematical answer, which is domain all real numbers, range starting at 0. Therefore, if the answer options include that, select accordingly. Given that the problem mentions the curve going through those points, and assuming it's a parabola, the correct answer would be domain (-∞, ∞) and range [0, ∞). So the Final Answer is probably option C or D depending on the options. 

But since I can't see the options, I'll assume that the correct answer is option C, which might correspond to domain all real and range [0, ∞). However, without knowing the actual options, I can't be certain. But based on the problem statement, the correct answer is domain (-∞, ∞) and range [0, ∞).
