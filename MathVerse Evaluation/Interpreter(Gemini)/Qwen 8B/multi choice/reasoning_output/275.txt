MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rhombus ABCD with diagonals AC and BD intersecting at point E. We need to find the measure of angle AEB. 

First, I remember that in a rhombus, all sides are equal. Also, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Wait, but here they mention that the diagonals intersect at E, and there are several predicates about perpendicularity. Let me check the given predicates again.

Looking back, there's a predicate stating that Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,D)). That means the diagonals are perpendicular to each other. Also, since it's a rhombus, the diagonals should bisect each other, so E is the midpoint of both diagonals. The IsMidpointOf predicates confirm that E is the midpoint of both AC and BD.

Now, the question gives AB = 2x + 3 and BC = 5x. But since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, AB must equal BC. Let me set up the equation: 2x + 3 = 5x. Solving for x, subtract 2x from both sides: 3 = 3x, so x = 1. Then substituting back, AB = 2(1) + 3 = 5 units. So each side of the rhombus is 5 units long.

Next, since the diagonals bisect each other at right angles, triangle AEB is formed by half of diagonal AC and half of diagonal BD. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, triangle AEB is a right triangle with legs being half of each diagonal. However, wait, the problem asks for angle AEB, which is the angle between the two diagonals at their intersection. But since the diagonals are perpendicular, angle AEB should be 90 degrees. But let me make sure.

Wait, the problem mentions several right angles. For example, RightAngle(Angle(A,E,B)) and others. So angle AEB is a right angle. Therefore, the measure is 90 degrees. But looking at the answer choices, option C is 90. But let me check if there's more to it.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. In a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, so yes, the angle between them is 90 degrees. So regardless of the side lengths, the angle between the diagonals is always 90 degrees. Therefore, angle AEB is 90 degrees. Hence, the answer should be C.

But wait, the problem gives some equations involving x. Did I use all the information? Let me verify. They said AB = 2x+3 and BC=5x, and since it's a rhombus, AB=BC. So solving for x gives x=1, but does that affect the angle? No, because the angle between diagonals depends on the properties of the rhombus, not the length of the sides. So even though we found x=1, that was just to confirm the side lengths, but the angle remains 90 degrees. 

Therefore, the answer should be C: 90.
