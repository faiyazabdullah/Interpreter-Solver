====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have two lines AB and CD intersecting at point O. There's a line OM that bisects angle AOC, and another line ON that's perpendicular to OM. We're told angle AOC is 70 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle CON. The answer choices are A:65°, B:55°, C:45°, D:35°.

First, I'll start by visualizing the diagram based on the given predicates. Points A, B, C, D are on lines AB and CD respectively, intersecting at O. Line OM bisects angle AOC, so it splits angle AOC into two equal parts. Since angle AOC is 70 degrees, each part would be half of that, so 35 degrees each. That means angle AOM and angle COM are each 35 degrees because OM is the bisector.

Then there's line ON, which is perpendicular to OM. So angle MON is 90 degrees. Now, we need to find angle CON. Let me think about how these points relate. Point N is on line ON, which is perpendicular to OM. Wait, but where exactly is point N located? From the predicates, ON is a line starting at O, so N is some point along that line. But since ON is perpendicular to OM, which is the angle bisector, maybe we can form a right angle there.

Let me try to break down the angles around point O. Since angle AOC is 70 degrees, and OM bisects it into two 35-degree angles. Then, ON is perpendicular to OM, so angle between OM and ON is 90 degrees. Let's consider angle CON. Point C is on line CD, which passes through O. So angle CON is formed between OC and ON. 

Wait, perhaps I should look at triangle CON. To find angle CON, maybe I need to find other angles in that triangle or use some properties. Alternatively, since ON is perpendicular to OM, maybe we can express angle CON in terms of other known angles.

Let me consider the angles around point O. The total around point O should add up to 360 degrees, but since we're dealing with angles formed by intersecting lines, maybe focusing on the angles within the figure is better. 

We know angle AOC is 70 degrees, and OM bisects it, so angle AOM is 35 degrees. Since ON is perpendicular to OM, angle MON is 90 degrees. So if we consider the line ON, starting from O, going perpendicularly away from OM. Now, looking at angle CON, which is between OC and ON. Let me see. 

From point O, OC is one side of angle AOC. The line ON is forming a right angle with OM. Since OM is the bisector, splitting angle AOC into two 35-degree angles. So angle COM is 35 degrees. Now, if ON is perpendicular to OM, then angle between OM and ON is 90 degrees. Therefore, angle CON could be angle COM plus angle MON minus something? Wait, maybe not. Let me draw this mentally.

Imagine standing at point O. OC is going off in some direction. OM is splitting angle AOC into two 35-degree angles. So from OC, moving towards M, which is in the direction of the bisector. Then ON is perpendicular to OM, so from OM, turning 90 degrees to get to ON. Depending on the direction of the perpendicular, ON could be either on one side or the other of OM. However, since ON is a line starting at O, and given the way the problem is set up, probably extending in such a way that it forms a right angle with OM.

Assuming that ON is drawn in the direction such that it creates a right angle with OM. So, from point O, OM is the bisector of angle AOC (so going towards the middle of angle AOC). Then ON is perpendicular to OM, which would mean that ON is forming a 90-degree angle with OM. Let me try to find angle CON.

Since angle COM is 35 degrees (as OM bisects angle AOC into two 35s), and ON is perpendicular to OM, then angle between OM and ON is 90 degrees. So if we consider angle CON, which is between OC and ON. Let me imagine that. Starting from OC, going to O, then to N. So angle CON would be angle between OC and ON. Let me think of the directions here.

Alternatively, maybe considering triangle CON. If we can find other angles in that triangle. But without knowing more sides or angles, maybe that's not helpful yet. Another approach: since ON is perpendicular to OM, and OM is the bisector, maybe angle CON relates to those angles.

Wait, let's think of the angles around point O. The line ON is perpendicular to OM, so if we consider the direction of ON relative to OC. Let me try to compute angle CON. Since angle COM is 35 degrees (from the bisector), and ON is perpendicular to OM, then the angle between OM and ON is 90 degrees. So depending on the direction of ON, angle CON could be angle COM plus or minus the angle between OM and ON. But direction matters here.

Suppose angle between OC and OM is 35 degrees (since OM bisects angle AOC into two 35s). Then, ON is perpendicular to OM, so if we go from OM towards ON, which is 90 degrees. So from OC, to OM is 35 degrees, then from OM to ON is 90 degrees. So the total angle from OC to ON would be 35 + 90 = 125 degrees? But that seems too much. Or maybe the other way?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing directions. Let me clarify. If angle AOC is 70 degrees, and OM bisects it, then angle AOM and angle COM are each 35 degrees. Now, ON is perpendicular to OM. So if we take the direction of OM, then ON is either going upwards or downwards from OM. Assuming standard position, let's assume that ON is in the direction that forms a right angle with OM. For example, if OM is going towards the middle of angle AOC, then ON could be going into the plane such that it's perpendicular.

But how does that affect angle CON? Let's say from point O, OC is one side of angle AOC. The line OM is splitting that angle into two 35-degree parts. So angle between OC and OM is 35 degrees. Then, ON is perpendicular to OM, so from OM, turning 90 degrees. So if we imagine standing at O facing along OM, then turning left or right 90 degrees to face ON. Depending on which way the perpendicular goes, the angle CON would vary.

But since the problem states that ON is perpendicular to OM, and the answer is likely unique, so we need to figure out the correct configuration.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make this clearer. Suppose point O is at the origin (0,0). Let me define line OM as lying along the x-axis for simplicity. Since angle AOC is 70 degrees, and OM is its bisector, so angle between OA and OM is 35 degrees, and between OC and OM is also 35 degrees. Wait, no—if OM is the bisector of angle AOC, then OA and OC are on opposite sides of OM. So if OM is the bisector, then OA and OC are symmetric with respect to OM. So if I place OM along the positive x-axis, then OA could be making a 35-degree angle above the x-axis, and OC making a 35-degree angle below the x-axis? Wait, but angle AOC is the angle between OA and OC, which would be 70 degrees. So yes, that makes sense. So OA is at +35 degrees from OM (x-axis), and OC is at -35 degrees from OM.

Now, ON is perpendicular to OM. Since OM is along the x-axis, ON would be vertical (along y-axis). But wait, perpendicular to x-axis is y-axis. So ON is along the y-axis. So point N is somewhere along the y-axis. Now, angle CON is the angle between OC and ON. OC is at -35 degrees from x-axis (assuming OM is x-axis), and ON is along the positive y-axis (if we take the upward direction). So the angle between OC and ON would be the angle between the line OC (which is pointing downward at 35 degrees below x-axis) and the positive y-axis.

To calculate that angle, we can think of the direction of OC. If OC is at -35 degrees from x-axis (i.e., pointing to the fourth quadrant), and ON is along positive y-axis (pointing straight up). So the angle between them would be 90 degrees (from x-axis to y-axis) minus the angle between OC and x-axis. Wait, OC is at -35 degrees from x-axis. So the angle between OC and y-axis would be 90 degrees - (-35 degrees)? Wait, no. Let me visualize.

If OC is pointing at 35 degrees below the x-axis (i.e., in the fourth quadrant), then the angle between OC and the positive y-axis would be measured from OC to y-axis. So, from OC (which is at -35 degrees from x-axis) to the positive y-axis (which is 90 degrees from x-axis). So the difference between 90 degrees and (-35 degrees) is 125 degrees? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, angles are typically measured as the smallest angle between two lines. So, the angle between OC and ON (y-axis) would be the acute or obtuse angle between them.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute using coordinate system. Let me consider vectors. The direction of OC is 35 degrees below x-axis, so its slope is tan(-35 degrees). The direction of ON is along positive y-axis, which is 90 degrees from x-axis. So the angle between OC and ON is the difference between 90 degrees and (-35 degrees), which is 125 degrees. But that's larger than 90 degrees, which would be the reflex angle. But we want the smaller angle between them. So the actual angle between OC and ON is 180 - 125 = 55 degrees? Because the angle between two lines is the smallest angle between them.

Wait, if OC is at -35 degrees (pointing to fourth quadrant) and ON is at 90 degrees (positive y-axis), then the angle between them is 90 - (-35) = 125 degrees, but since that's greater than 90, the smaller angle would be 180 - 125 = 55 degrees. Hence, angle CON is 55 degrees. Which corresponds to answer B.

So according to this calculation, angle CON is 55 degrees. Let me check again. If OM is the bisector, then angle between OA and OC is 70 degrees. ON is perpendicular to OM, so in this coordinate system, ON is along y-axis. OC is at -35 degrees. The angle between OC and ON is 55 degrees. So answer B:55°.

Another way to think: since angle between OC and OM is 35 degrees, and ON is perpendicular to OM, then angle between OM and ON is 90 degrees. So the total angle between OC and ON would be angle between OC and OM plus angle between OM and ON, but only if they are in the same rotational direction. Wait, but depending on the direction of ON. If ON is on the other side of OM relative to OC, then it might be different.

Wait, in my coordinate system, OC is pointing to the fourth quadrant (below x-axis), OM is along x-axis, and ON is along positive y-axis. So from OC to OM is 35 degrees clockwise, then from OM to ON is 90 degrees counterclockwise. So the total angle from OC to ON would be 35 degrees clockwise plus 90 degrees counterclockwise, which wraps around. Hmm, maybe I need to think of it as the sum of the angles.

Alternatively, using vector math: the angle between OC and ON. Let me represent OC as a vector. Let’s suppose unit vectors. Let’s say OC has direction θ = -35 degrees (from x-axis). ON is along positive y-axis, which is θ = 90 degrees. The angle between them is |θ_ON - θ_OC| = |90 - (-35)| = 125 degrees. But since angles between lines are considered as the smallest angle, we subtract from 180 if it's over 90. So 125 degrees is obtuse, so the acute angle between them is 180 - 125 = 55 degrees. Hence, angle CON is 55 degrees, which is answer B.

Therefore, the correct answer should be B:55°.
