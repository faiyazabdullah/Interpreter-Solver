QUESTION:
In the right triangle with hypotenuse length 74 and two sides length 24 and x, use a Pythagorean Triple to find x.

CHOICES:
A:66
B:68
C:70
D:72

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right triangle with hypotenuse 74 and one leg is 24. We need to find the other leg, which is labeled as x. The options are A:66, B:68, C:70, D:72. 

First, I remember the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. The formula is a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse. 

Given that, here the hypotenuse is 74, so c = 74. One of the legs is 24, so let's call that a = 24. The other leg is x, so b = x. Plugging these into the Pythagorean theorem gives us 24² + x² = 74². 

Now, I need to calculate 24 squared. Let me do that first. 24 times 24... 24*20 is 480, and 24*4 is 96, so adding those together gives 480+96=576. So 24² is 576. Then, 74 squared. Hmm, 70 squared is 4900, and 4 squared is 16. But wait, that's if it were (70+4)². Wait, actually, 74 squared is (70 + 4)^2. Let me compute that correctly. 

Expanding (a+b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So 70² + 2*70*4 + 4² = 4900 + 560 + 16 = 4900 + 560 is 5460, plus 16 is 5476. So 74² equals 5476. 

So substituting back into the equation: 576 + x² = 5476. To find x², subtract 576 from both sides. So x² = 5476 - 576. Let me calculate that. 

Subtracting 576 from 5476: 5476 minus 500 is 4976, then minus 76 more would be 4976 - 76 = 4900. Wait, that seems too clean. Let me check again. 5476 - 576. Let's break down 576 as 500 + 76. So 5476 - 500 = 4976, then subtract 76: 4976 - 76 = 4900. Yes, that's correct. So x² = 4900. 

Taking the square root of both sides, x = sqrt(4900). What's sqrt(4900)? Well, sqrt(49*100) = sqrt(49)*sqrt(100) = 7*10 = 70. So x is 70. 

Looking at the answer choices, option C is 70. Therefore, the correct answer should be C. 

Wait, but let me verify once more. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the squares? Let me confirm 74 squared again. 70^2 is 4900, 4^2 is 16, and the cross term is 2*70*4=560. Adding them up: 4900 + 560 = 5460, plus 16 is 5476. Correct. Then 24^2 is indeed 576. Subtracting 576 from 5476 gives 4900. Square root of 4900 is definitely 70. Yep, that checks out. So the answer is C.
