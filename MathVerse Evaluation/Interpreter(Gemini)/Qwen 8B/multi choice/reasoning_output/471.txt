MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the equation of a semicircle that passes through the points (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), and (7,0). The given predicates mention that all these points lie on a circle centered at O, which is (0,0). Also, the radius of the circle is 7 units since the distance from O to each point is 7. 

First, I need to confirm the center and radius of the circle. Since all points A, B, C, D, E are on the circle with center O at (0,0), and each has a length of 7 from O. For example, point A is (-7,0), so the distance from O (0,0) to A is sqrt[(-7-0)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt(49) = 7. Similarly, checking point C (0,7): sqrt[(0-0)^2 + (7-0)^2] = 7. Same for E (7,0), D (5,5): sqrt[(5)^2 + (5)^2] = sqrt(25+25)=sqrt(50)? Wait, wait, hold on! Wait, the problem says that the points are on a circle with radius 7. But if point D is (5,5), then the distance from O would be sqrt(5² +5²) = sqrt(50) ≈7.07, which isn't exactly 7. Hmm, but according to the given predicates, PointLiesOnCircle(D,Circle(O)) and LengthOf(Line(O,D)) is 7? Wait, there's a contradiction here. Let me check again.

Wait, looking back at the given data: The user provided coordinates for O as (0,0), and points A=(-7,0), B=(-5,5), C=(0,7), D=(5,5), E=(7,0). Then they mentioned that all these points lie on Circle(O), and the length of OA, OC, OE is 7. However, for point D (5,5), the distance from O is sqrt(5² +5²) = sqrt(50) ≈7.07, which is not 7. But according to the predicates, PointLiesOnCircle(D,Circle(O)) and IsRadiusOf(Line(O,D),Circle(O))? Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the coordinates provided are different?

Wait, the user wrote: "LengthOf(Line(O,A),7)" and same for others. So according to the given data, the length from O to each point is 7. But in reality, for point D (5,5), the distance should be sqrt(50) which is approximately 7.07. This suggests that either the coordinates are incorrect, or there's some misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe the points aren't all on the same circle? But the problem states it's a semicircle passing through those points. 

Wait, but the problem says "the following graph shows a semicircle which passes..." implying that the points are on the semicircle. However, the given coordinates may have inconsistencies. Let me recheck the coordinates:

Points given:

A=(-7,0), which is 7 units left of O (0,0). Correct.

B=(-5,5): distance from O is sqrt(25 +25)=sqrt(50)≈7.07. But according to the predicates, this should be on the circle with radius 7. That's conflicting. Similarly for D=(5,5), same distance. C=(0,7): distance is 7, correct. E=(7,0): same as A. So there's inconsistency here. But the problem statement says that all points lie on the circle. Maybe the coordinates provided are not accurate? Or maybe the problem uses approximate values?

Alternatively, perhaps the points are not all on the same circle? But the problem states it's a semicircle passing through them. This seems contradictory. Unless the problem has a typo. But assuming that the given data is correct, perhaps the coordinates are different. Wait, maybe I misread the coordinates. Let me check again.

Original problem says:

A=(-7,0)

B=(-5,5)

C=(0,7)

D=(5,5)

E=(7,0)

O=(0,0)

But according to these coordinates, points B and D are not at distance 7 from O. Therefore, there's a conflict. However, the given predicates say that Line(O,B) is a radius of the circle, so its length should be 7. Hence, the coordinates provided might be wrong? Or perhaps the problem is using a different coordinate system?

Alternatively, maybe the points are not all on the same circle. Wait, but the problem says it's a semicircle passing through these points. So perhaps the actual circle has a different radius? But the given predicates state that the radii are 7. So this seems like a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe the points are on a semicircle, so only half of the circle? But even so, the distance from O to each point should still be the same. So unless the semicircle is part of a larger circle. But the problem says it's a semicircle, so it's half of a full circle. 

This seems confusing. However, given that the problem asks for the equation of the semicircle, and the given points are supposed to lie on it, perhaps we need to find the equation regardless of the given coordinates' discrepancies. Or perhaps the coordinates provided in the problem are illustrative, and we should rely on the predicates rather than the coordinates. 

Let me focus on the predicates instead of the coordinates. According to the predicates, O is the center, and OA, OC, OE are radii of length 7. Points B and D also lie on the circle, so their distances from O should also be 7. But according to the coordinates given, B and D are at (−5,5) and (5,5), which have distance sqrt(50) ≈7.07. This discrepancy suggests that either the coordinates are incorrect, or the problem expects us to use the predicates over the coordinates. 

Assuming that the predicates take precedence, perhaps the coordinates provided are just examples, and the actual positions of B and D are such that they are 7 units from O. For instance, point B could be at (-√(7² -5²), something?), but this complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the problem intended for points B and D to be at (−√(7² -5²), y) such that their distance from O is 7. 

But without more info, perhaps the problem wants us to consider that O is (0,0), and the circle has radius 7. Then, the equation of the circle would be x² + y² = 49. However, the semicircle would be either upper or lower half. Given that points like (0,7) and (7,0) are on the circle, the semicircle is likely the upper half (since (0,7) is topmost point). 

But then the points (-5,5) and (5,5) would lie on the circle. Let's check if they satisfy x² + y² = 49. For point B (-5,5): (-5)^2 +5^2=25+25=50≠49. So this doesn't fit. Hence, there's a contradiction. 

Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake in the coordinates, but given that the predicates say that all points lie on the circle with radius 7, we need to proceed accordingly. 

Wait, another thought: maybe the circle is not centered at O=(0,0)? Wait, the problem says that Circle(O), which implies O is the center. But if O is (0,0), then the points must be at distance 7 from O. But the coordinates given don't align. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that O is not at (0,0)? Wait, the problem says O=(0,0). 

Hmm. This is very confusing. However, since the problem gives specific coordinates for points and says they lie on the circle, but mathematically they don't, I think there's an error in the problem setup. However, as a solver, I need to work with the given information. 

Perhaps the key is that despite the coordinates appearing inconsistent, we are to assume that O is the origin and the circle has radius 7. Thus, the equation of the full circle is x² + y² = 49. The semicircle would then be the upper half (since point C is (0,7), which is on the positive y-axis). Therefore, the equation of the semicircle is x² + y² = 49 with y ≥ 0. 

But the given points B and D do not satisfy this equation. However, since the problem mentions a semicircle passing through those points, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the semicircle is not the upper half but another orientation? Like, perhaps it's the right half, but then points like (-7,0) wouldn't be included. 

Alternatively, maybe the semicircle is the one where the diameter is from (-7,0) to (7,0), making the center at (0,0) and radius 7. In that case, the equation would indeed be x² + y² = 49 with y ≥ 0. However, points B and D would not lie on this semicircle. 

Given this confusion, I think the problem might have a mistake in the coordinates provided for points B and D, but based on the given predicates that all points lie on a circle centered at O with radius 7, the equation of the circle is x² + y² = 49. Since it's a semicircle, the equation would depend on which half is considered. Since the points include (0,7), which is the topmost point, the semicircle is the upper half. 

Thus, the answer would be the equation of the circle x² + y² = 49, restricted to y ≥ 0. But the answer choices are not listed, and the user said "No choices found." But the original instruction said to choose from A-D. Wait, but in the initial problem description, the answer choices were not provided, hence the user said "No choices found." However, the user's last message includes the instruction to provide the answer as Final Answer: A/B/C/D. 

Since the problem requires selecting the correct answer choice, but the user didn't provide options, perhaps the original question had options, and the assistant is to infer based on the given data. Assuming that the correct answer is the equation x² + y² = 49, but since the answer choices are missing, I'm supposed to pick the corresponding letter. However, without knowing the options, this is challenging. 

Alternatively, considering that the semicircle is the upper half, the equation is x² + y² = 49 with y ≥ 0. So if the answer choices included this equation, the correct choice would be the one matching it. Since the user hasn't provided options, but the instructions require choosing A-D, perhaps the intended answer is the standard circle equation, so the answer is the equation x² + y² = 49, and the semicircle is the upper half. 

However, since the user's final answer must be a single letter (A-D), and without knowing the options, it's impossible to know. But perhaps the original problem had options like A: x² + y² = 49, B: ... etc. Assuming that the correct answer is option A, I'll go with that. Hence, the Final Answer: A.
