MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the radius of a semicircle that passes through the points (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), and (7,0). The question mentions these points lie on a semicircle, so they're all on the circumference of a circle, but since it's a semicircle, maybe it's half of a full circle? Wait, but the problem says "semicircle," so perhaps it's a circle that's been cut in half? Or maybe the semicircle is part of a larger circle?

First, I should check if all these points lie on the same circle. Since they mention a semicircle, maybe the circle has its diameter along the x-axis from (-7,0) to (7,0)? Let me see. The points given are symmetric around the y-axis because (-7,0) and (7,0) are mirror images, (-5,5) and (5,5) are also mirrors, and (0,7) is on the y-axis. That symmetry suggests that the center of the circle might be at the origin (0,0), since those points are symmetric with respect to the origin. 

Wait, the problem includes some predicates about Line(D, (0,0)) where D is (0,7). So point D is (0,7), and there's a line from D to (0,0), which is the vertical line along the y-axis. Then, the radius of that line is mentioned as 7 units. Because the length of Line(D, (0,0)) is 7, since D is at (0,7) and (0,0) is the origin. So that line's length is 7, which would imply that the radius of the circle is 7. But wait, the circle passing through all these points—let me verify if all points are 7 units away from the origin.

Let's calculate the distance from each point to the origin (0,0):

For (-7,0): sqrt((-7)^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(49) = 7. Okay, that's 7.

For (-5,5): sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07. Hmm, that's more than 7. Wait, that doesn't fit. So if the radius was 7, then (-5,5) wouldn't lie on the circle centered at the origin. But according to the given predicates, PointLiesOnCircle(B,C) where B is (-5,5) and C is the circle. Similarly for E (5,5). So if the circle's center isn't at the origin, maybe?

Wait, maybe the circle isn't centered at the origin. Let's think again. The problem states that there's a semicircle passing through those five points. Maybe the semicircle is drawn with diameter from (-7,0) to (7,0), making the center at (0,0), and radius 7. However, the other points like (-5,5) and (5,5) would have to lie on that circle. But earlier calculation shows that (-5,5) is sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07, which is longer than 7. So that contradicts. Therefore, my assumption about the center being at the origin must be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the center is somewhere else. Let me try finding the circumcircle of three non-collinear points. For example, take points A(-7,0), D(0,7), and F(7,0). Let's find the circumradius of these three points.

First, find the perpendicular bisectors of two sides of triangle ADF.

Midpoint of AF: between (-7,0) and (7,0) is (0,0). The slope of AF is (0-0)/(7 - (-7)) = 0, so horizontal line. The perpendicular bisector is vertical line through midpoint (0,0), so equation x=0.

Midpoint of AD: between (-7,0) and (0,7) is (-3.5, 3.5). The slope of AD is (7-0)/(0 - (-7)) = 7/7 = 1. The perpendicular bisector would have slope -1. Equation: y - 3.5 = -1(x + 3.5). Simplify: y = -x -3.5 + 3.5 → y = -x.

So intersection of x=0 and y=-x is (0,0). So the center is at (0,0). Wait, but then the radius would be distance from (0,0) to A(-7,0) is 7, but as before, distance from (0,0) to D(0,7) is 7. So that works. But then why does (-5,5) not lie on this circle? Let me check. Distance from (-5,5) to (0,0) is sqrt(25+25)=sqrt(50)≈7.07, which is more than 7. So that point is outside the circle. Contradiction. So something's wrong here.

But according to the given predicates, PointLiesOnCircle(B,C) where B is (-5,5). So maybe the circle isn't centered at (0,0). How come?

Wait, maybe the circle isn't centered at (0,0). Let me try another approach. Suppose the circle passes through points A(-7,0), B(-5,5), D(0,7), E(5,5), F(7,0). Let's find the equation of the circle passing through these points.

General equation of a circle: (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2.

Plug in point A(-7,0): (-7-h)^2 + (0 -k)^2 = r^2 → (h+7)^2 + k² = r².

Point F(7,0): (7-h)^2 + k² = r².

Subtracting equations: (7-h)^2 - (h+7)^2 = 0. Expand:

[49 -14h + h²] - [h² +14h +49] = 49 -14h + h² -h² -14h -49 = -28h = 0 → h=0. So the x-coordinate of the center is 0. So center is (0,k).

Now plug in point D(0,7): (0-0)^2 + (7 -k)^2 = r² → (7 -k)^2 = r².

Also, point A(-7,0): (-7-0)^2 + (0 -k)^2 = r² → 49 +k² = r².

Set equal: 49 +k² = (7 -k)^2 → expand RHS: 49 -14k +k². Subtract 49 +k² from both sides:

0 = -14k → k=0. So center is (0,0), radius squared is 49 +0 =49 → radius is 7. But then point B(-5,5) would be at distance sqrt( (-5)^2 +5^2 )=sqrt(50) which is not 7. So contradiction again. Hence, how can the points B and E lie on the circle? There must be a mistake here.

Wait, but the problem says that the semicircle passes through those points. Could it be that the semicircle is not the entire circle? For instance, maybe it's a semicircle with diameter from (-7,0) to (7,0), and the other points lie on the upper semicircle. But then the radius would still be 7, but the points B and E would not lie on the circle. Alternatively, maybe the circle is different. Perhaps the semicircle is not the standard one. Maybe the circle is not centered at (0,0). Wait, but according to the given predicates, there are several radii mentioned. For example, RadiusOf(Line(D, (0,0)),C) is stated, and LengthOf(Line(D, (0,0)),7). So the line from D(0,7) to (0,0) has length 7, and that line is a radius of circle C. So that implies that the radius is 7. Which would mean that the circle has radius 7. But then the previous calculation shows that points B and E are not on that circle. So there's inconsistency here. Unless there's a misunderstanding of the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the circle is not centered at (0,0). Let me re-examine the given predicates. There's a predicate: IsRadiusOf(Line(A,(0,0)),C). And LengthOf(Line(A,(0,0)),7). So the line from A(-7,0) to (0,0) has length 7, which is the radius of the circle C. So that means that the radius of the circle is 7. Thus, the circle C has radius 7. Therefore, all the points lying on circle C must be at distance 7 from the center. But the center of the circle is not necessarily (0,0). Wait, but the line from A(-7,0) to (0,0) is a radius. So that means that the center of the circle is at (0,0)? Because the radius is the line from the center to the circumference. So if Line(A,(0,0)) is a radius, then (0,0) must be the center. Because the radius connects the center to the point on the circle. So if A is on the circle, then the center would be at (0,0). So that would make the center (0,0), and radius 7. But then point B(-5,5) is not on that circle. This seems contradictory.

But the problem states that PointLiesOnCircle(B,C), so B must lie on the circle. So there's a contradiction unless my understanding is wrong. Maybe the line from A to (0,0) is not the radius, but just a line whose length equals the radius. Wait, the predicate says "RadiusOf(Line(A,(0,0)),C)" and "LengthOf(Line(A,(0,0)),7)". So the length of the line from A to (0,0) is 7, and that line is a radius of the circle C. So that would imply that the center of circle C is at (0,0), because the radius is a line segment from the center to the circumference. So if the line from A to (0,0) is a radius, then (0,0) is the center, and A is a point on the circle. Therefore, the radius is 7. But then how do points B, D, E, F lie on the circle?

Wait, let's check point D(0,7). The distance from (0,0) to D is 7, so yes, it lies on the circle. Point F(7,0) is also at distance 7. Point A(-7,0) is also at distance 7. So points A, D, F are on the circle. What about B(-5,5)? Its distance from (0,0) is sqrt(25 +25) = sqrt(50) ≈7.07, which is longer than 7. So it shouldn't be on the circle. But the problem states that PointLiesOnCircle(B,C). So this is conflicting. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. How can this be resolved?

Ah! Maybe the line from A to (0,0) is not the radius, but the length of that line is equal to the radius. So the radius is 7, but the center is not (0,0). Let me think. The line from A(-7,0) to (0,0) has length 7. If this line is a radius, then the center could be at (0,0), but that leads to the contradiction. Alternatively, maybe the center is elsewhere. For example, suppose the radius is 7, and the line from A(-7,0) to some point (which may not be the center) has length 7. But that doesn't directly tell us where the center is. Wait, the predicate says "RadiusOf(Line(A,(0,0)),C)", which likely means that the line segment from A to (0,0) is a radius of circle C. So that would imply that (0,0) is the center of the circle, because a radius is a line segment from the center to the circumference. Therefore, if the line from A to (0,0) is a radius, then (0,0) must be the center, and A is on the circle. So that gives the radius as 7. But then other points like B(-5,5) are not on the circle. So either there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the circle is not the standard one. Let me consider that the semicircle is not the full circle. For example, if the semicircle is drawn with diameter from (-7,0) to (7,0), then the center is at (0,0), radius 7, and the semicircle would be the upper half (since points D(0,7) are on the top). But points B(-5,5) and E(5,5) would lie on the semicircle. Wait, but their distance from (0,0) is sqrt(50), which is greater than 7. So they would be outside the circle. Hence, not on the semicircle. So this is impossible.

This suggests that there's an error in the initial assumptions. Let me go back to the given predicates. It says "RadiusOf(Line(D, (0,0)),C)" and "LengthOf(Line(D, (0,0)),7)". So the line from D(0,7) to (0,0) has length 7, and that line is a radius of circle C. So this implies that the radius of the circle is 7, and the line from D(0,7) to (0,0) is a radius. Therefore, the center of the circle is at (0,0), since the radius is from the center to the circumference. So the center is at (0,0), and the radius is 7. But then again, points B and E are not on the circle. So how can they be on the circle? This seems like a contradiction. Perhaps the problem is referring to a different circle?

Wait, the problem says "the following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0)". So maybe the semicircle is not the full circle, but just a semicircle, and the points are arranged such that they lie on the semicircle. For example, the semicircle could be the upper half of a circle with diameter from (-7,0) to (7,0), but then the other points would have to lie on the arc. But again, the distance from (0,0) to (-5,5) is sqrt(50), which is larger than 7. So they wouldn't lie on the semicircle.

Alternatively, maybe the semicircle is not centered at (0,0). Let me try to find the circle that passes through all five points. Let me use the general equation of a circle passing through A(-7,0), B(-5,5), D(0,7), E(5,5), F(7,0). As before, since points A and F are symmetric about the y-axis, and points B and E are symmetric, and D is on the y-axis, the center must lie on the y-axis. So center is (0,k). Let's plug in points A(-7,0) and D(0,7) into the circle equation.

Equation: x² + (y - k)^2 = r².

For point A(-7,0): (-7)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r² → 49 + k² = r².

For point D(0,7): 0^2 + (7 - k)^2 = r² → (7 - k)^2 = r².

Setting equal: 49 + k² = (7 - k)^2 → expand RHS: 49 -14k +k².

So 49 +k² = 49 -14k +k² → subtract 49 +k² from both sides: 0 = -14k → k=0.

So center is (0,0), radius squared is 49 +0 =49 → radius is 7. But then point B(-5,5) is at distance sqrt(25 +25) = sqrt(50), which is not 7. So this is impossible. Hence, the only way for all points to lie on the circle is if the circle has a radius larger than 7. But according to the given predicates, the radius is 7. So there's a contradiction.

Wait, maybe the circle is not unique? Or perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me double-check the distance from (-5,5) to (0,0): sqrt( (-5)^2 +5^2 ) = sqrt(25 +25) = sqrt(50) ≈7.07. So indeed, it's longer than 7. Hence, unless there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the circle is not the one with center at (0,0), but another circle. Let me try to find the circle passing through points A(-7,0), B(-5,5), D(0,7), E(5,5), F(7,0). Let's assume that the center is at (h,k). Using points A and F, since they are symmetric across the y-axis, the center must lie on the y-axis (because the perpendicular bisector of AF is the y-axis). So h=0. Now, the center is (0,k).

Using points A(-7,0) and D(0,7):

Distance from center (0,k) to A: sqrt( (-7 -0)^2 + (0 -k)^2 ) = sqrt(49 +k²).

Distance from center to D(0,7): sqrt( (0 -0)^2 + (7 -k)^2 ) = |7 -k|.

These distances must be equal:

sqrt(49 +k²) = |7 -k|.

Square both sides:

49 +k² = (7 -k)^2 → 49 +k² = 49 -14k +k² → cancel terms → 0 = -14k → k=0.

Again, leading to center at (0,0), radius 7. So this suggests that the only circle passing through A, D, F is the one with center at (0,0) and radius 7. But then points B and E are not on it. So how can they be on the circle?

Unless the problem statement has a typo, or I misread it. Wait, looking back, the problem says "a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0)". Maybe the semicircle is not the full circle, but only part of it. For example, maybe it's the upper semicircle of a larger circle. Let me assume that the circle has a larger radius. Let me try to find the circle passing through all five points.

Take points A(-7,0), B(-5,5), D(0,7), E(5,5), F(7,0). Let me use points A, B, D to find the circle.

General equation: (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2.

Plugging in A(-7,0): (-7-h)^2 + (0 -k)^2 = r^2 → (h+7)^2 +k² = r².

Plugging in B(-5,5): (-5-h)^2 + (5 -k)^2 = r².

Plugging in D(0,7): (0-h)^2 + (7 -k)^2 = r² → h² + (7 -k)^2 = r².

So now we have three equations:

1. (h+7)^2 +k² = r²

2. (-5-h)^2 + (5 -k)^2 = r²

3. h² + (7 -k)^2 = r²

Set equation 1 equal to equation 3:

(h+7)^2 +k² = h² + (7 -k)^2

Expand left side: h² +14h +49 +k²

Right side: h² + 49 -14k +k²

Subtract right side from left: 14h = -14k → h = -k.

So h = -k.

Now substitute h = -k into equation 3 and equation 2.

From equation 3: h² + (7 -k)^2 = r². With h = -k, it becomes:

k² + (7 -k)^2 = r².

From equation 1: (h+7)^2 +k² = r² → (-k +7)^2 +k² = r² → (7 -k)^2 +k² = r². Same as equation 3. So consistent.

Now use equation 2: (-5 -h)^2 + (5 -k)^2 = r². Substitute h = -k:

(-5 - (-k))^2 + (5 -k)^2 = r² → (-5 +k)^2 + (5 -k)^2 = r².

Note that (-5 +k)^2 = (k -5)^2, and (5 -k)^2 = (k -5)^2. So total is 2*(k-5)^2 = r².

But from equation 3, r² = k² + (7 -k)^2.

Thus:

2*(k-5)^2 = k² + (7 -k)^2.

Expand both sides:

Left: 2(k² -10k +25) = 2k² -20k +50.

Right: k² + (49 -14k +k²) = 2k² -14k +49.

Set equal:

2k² -20k +50 = 2k² -14k +49.

Subtract 2k² from both sides:

-20k +50 = -14k +49.

Bring all terms to left:

-20k +50 +14k -49 = 0 → -6k +1 = 0 → -6k = -1 → k = 1/6.

Thus, k = 1/6. Since h = -k, h = -1/6.

Now compute r² from equation 3: k² + (7 -k)^2.

k = 1/6:

k² = (1/6)^2 = 1/36.

7 -k = 7 - 1/6 = 41/6. Squared: (41/6)^2 = 1681/36.

Total r² = 1/36 + 1681/36 = 1682/36 = 841/18 ≈46.722...

Then r = sqrt(841/18) = 29/sqrt(18) = 29/(3√2) ≈ 29/4.2426 ≈6.83.

So the radius is approximately 6.83 units, which is less than 7. But the given predicates say that the radius is 7. This contradicts. So what's going on here?

Wait, but the problem says that there are several predicates indicating that the radius is 7. Like, for example, the line from D(0,7) to (0,0) has length 7, and that line is a radius. So according to the problem's predicates, the radius is 7. But our calculation shows that to pass through all five points, the radius must be 29/(3√2), which is approximately 6.83. So this is inconsistent. 

This suggests that there's either an error in the problem setup or in the given predicates. But assuming that the problem is correctly formulated, perhaps the confusion comes from the fact that the semicircle is not the full circle. Let me think again.

If the semicircle is part of the circle with radius 7, then maybe the points B and E are on the semicircle, even though they are not on the full circle. But how? If the circle has radius 7, then points B and E would not lie on it. So this seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the semicircle is not a standard semicircle. For example, it could be a semicircle with diameter from (-7,0) to (0,7), but that would make the diameter longer than 7. Let me calculate the length of that diameter. From (-7,0) to (0,7): distance is sqrt(7² +7²) = 7√2 ≈9.899. So the radius would be half that, 7√2 /2 ≈6.93. Close to our previous calculation. But the given predicates say the radius is 7. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the semicircle is constructed differently. For example, taking the diameter as from (-7,0) to (7,0), making radius 7, and the semicircle is the upper half. Points A(-7,0), F(7,0), D(0,7) are on the semicircle. Points B(-5,5) and E(5,5) would be inside the circle, not on the semicircle. So this doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the semicircle is the lower half? No, because D is at (0,7), which is on the upper half.

Hmm. Given the contradictions arising from the given predicates, perhaps the correct radius is 7, as per the predicates, and the points B and E are actually on the circle despite the distance calculation. But how?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the distance from B(-5,5) to (0,0). Let me recalculate:

Distance squared is (-5)^2 +5^2 =25 +25 =50. Square root is √50 ≈7.07. Yes, that's correct. So it's not on the circle with radius 7. So the problem must have an error, or there's a different interpretation.

Wait, the problem says it's a semicircle, not a full circle. Maybe the semicircle is not the usual upper or lower half. Maybe it's a semicircle formed by connecting certain points. For example, if the semicircle is part of a larger circle, but only a portion is considered. However, without knowing the exact construction, it's hard to say.

Given the provided predicates, including that the radius is 7, and the presence of the line from D(0,7) to (0,0) being a radius, I think the intended answer is 7, despite the apparent contradiction with point B. Perhaps the problem assumes that the points are on the circle, and the radius is 7, ignoring the inconsistencies in coordinates. Or perhaps there's a different circle.

Wait, another possibility: the circle is defined such that the line from D(0,7) to (0,0) is a radius, but the center is not at (0,0). For example, if the line from D(0,7) to some other point is a radius. Wait, the predicate says "RadiusOf(Line(D, (0,0)),C)". So the line segment from D to (0,0) is a radius of circle C. So that means that the center of the circle is at (0,0), because the radius is a line from the center to the circumference. Hence, the center is (0,0), and the radius is 7. But then points B and E are not on the circle. 

This seems to suggest that there's an inconsistency in the problem, but since the question asks to state the radius based on the given predicates, and the predicates explicitly state that the length of Line(D, (0,0)) is 7, and that it is a radius, then the radius must be 7. Even though the points don't seem to align, perhaps the problem expects us to trust the given predicates over the coordinate calculations. 

In that case, the answer is 7 units.
