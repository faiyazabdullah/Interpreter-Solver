====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So the question is about finding the equation of a vertical blue line in a graph, given some predicates. Let me start by understanding the given information.

First, the predicates listed are:

- PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x,0))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(0,y))
- Line(x,0)
- Line(0,y)
- Perpendicular(Line(x,0), Line(0,y))
- Equals(0,0)

Hmm, these seem like they're defining certain lines and their properties. Let me break them down one by one.

Starting with the first two: PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x,0)) and similarly for Line(0,y). Wait, maybe there's a typo here? Because Line(x,0) would typically represent a horizontal line if x is varying, but usually, lines are defined by equations. Maybe the notation here is different. Let me think. In standard coordinate geometry, a horizontal line has the form y = k, and a vertical line is x = h. But the way these lines are written here seems off. For example, Line(x,0) could be interpreted as a line where y=0, which is the x-axis. Similarly, Line(0,y) would be the y-axis. But how does that work with variables?

Wait, perhaps the Line(x,0) refers to a general line where y = 0, which is the x-axis. Similarly, Line(0,y) is the y-axis. Then, the Perpendicular predicate says that these two lines are perpendicular. That makes sense because the x-axis and y-axis are perpendicular. 

But then there's also the Equals(0,0). That probably means that the origin point (0,0) is being referenced here. Also, the PointLiesOnLine statements indicate that the origin (0,0) lies on both the x-axis (Line(x,0)) and the y-axis (Line(0,y)). Which is true since the origin is where they intersect.

Now, the question asks for the equation of a vertical blue line. Since vertical lines have equations of the form x = constant. But we need to find which one it is. However, the given predicates don't mention a specific point that the vertical line passes through. Wait, unless there's something missing here. Let me check again.

Looking at the given predicates, the only points mentioned are the origin (0,0). The lines are the x-axis and y-axis. There's no other points specified. So the problem states that there's a vertical blue line in the graph. But without more information, such as a specific point it passes through or its slope, how can we determine the equation?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The problem mentions "a vertical blue line," but perhaps it's referring to one of the existing lines mentioned in the predicates. The vertical line would be the y-axis, which is Line(0,y). But the y-axis is vertical, so its equation is x=0. Alternatively, if there's another vertical line, but the given predicates only mention the x-axis and y-axis.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. Since the given predicates already define the y-axis as a vertical line (Line(0,y)), which is x=0. Therefore, the equation of the vertical blue line is x=0. But the answer choices aren't provided here, but the user said "No choices found." However, according to the instructions, the answer must be selected from options A-D, but since there are none, maybe the answer is inferred from the given data.

Wait, the original problem might have had answer choices, but the user hasn't included them. But according to the problem statement, the answer choices are "No choices found." But that's part of the problem setup. Wait, looking back:

The user wrote:

"ANSWER CHOICES:
No choices found."

So the actual answer choices were not provided, hence why it's "No choices found." But the task is to provide the answer based on the given info. However, the user wants us to pick from A-D even though there are no choices. Wait, maybe the original problem had answer choices, but they weren't included here. Hmm, but regardless, the system requires choosing between A-D. But the user's instruction says to "select the correct answer choice" but since there are no choices, perhaps the answer is inferred.

Wait, maybe the vertical line is the y-axis, whose equation is x=0. So the answer is x=0. But how to map that to the answer choices? Since there are no choices, but the user wants the assistant to choose from A-D. But the original problem might have had answer choices, but they are missing here. However, the user instructed to proceed regardless.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing the knowledge that vertical lines are of the form x=a, and since the given lines include the y-axis (x=0), that's the answer. Hence, the equation is x=0. If the answer choices were, say, A: x=0, B: y=0, etc., then the answer would be A. But since the answer choices are not present, but the user's instruction requires selecting from A-D, perhaps the intended answer is A, assuming that the vertical line is the y-axis (x=0).

Therefore, following the reasoning, the equation of the vertical line is x=0, which corresponds to answer choice A. Hence, the Final Answer should be A.
