====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have triangle ABC with an inscribed circle centered at point I. The points D, E, F are the points where the incircle touches the sides AB, BC, and AC respectively. We're told that angle DEF is 52 degrees, and we need to find the measure of angle A.

First, I need to recall some properties about incircles and contact points. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors of triangle ABC. The points D, E, F are the points where the incircle touches the sides, so ID, IE, IF are radii of the incircle and are perpendicular to the respective sides. That means ID ⊥ AB, IE ⊥ BC, and IF ⊥ AC.

Now, looking at the given information, angle DEF is 52 degrees. Points D, E, F are on the sides of the triangle, but they also form triangle DEF. Wait, how does triangle DEF relate to triangle ABC?

I remember there's something called the contact triangle or the intouch triangle, which is formed by connecting the points where the incircle touches the sides. In this case, DEF is the contact triangle. The angles of the contact triangle relate to the original triangle's angles.

But how exactly? Let me think. Each angle in the contact triangle DEF would depend on the angles of ABC. Maybe there's a formula connecting them. Alternatively, perhaps considering the excentral triangle or other centers, but maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, since D, E, F are points of tangency, maybe we can use coordinates or trigonometry. But since it's a synthetic geometry problem, probably there's a relationship using angles.

Let me consider triangle DEF. Since each of ID, IE, IF are radii and are perpendicular to the sides, those segments are perpendicular to AB, BC, AC respectively. Therefore, lines ID, IE, IF are altitudes of the contact triangle DEF? Not sure. Or maybe considering the angles between these radii.

Wait, another idea: The angles at points D, E, F in triangle DEF can be expressed in terms of the angles of ABC. For example, angle at D in triangle DEF. Let me try to visualize.

Since D is the touch point on AB, and ID is perpendicular to AB. Similarly, E is the touch point on BC, so IE is perpendicular to BC. Then, DE connects points D and E. To find angle at E in triangle DEF, maybe we can look at the angles between ED and EF.

Alternatively, since DEF is the contact triangle, there might be known relations. Let me check my memory. In the contact triangle, each angle is π minus twice the corresponding angle of the original triangle. Wait, no. Wait, maybe it's half the difference of two angles?

Alternatively, let me think about the angles of triangle DEF. Let me denote the angles of ABC as α (angle at A), β (at B), γ (at C). Since I is the incenter, angles at the incenter are related to the angles of ABC.

But how does that connect to triangle DEF?

Another approach: Let's consider the angles of triangle DEF. For instance, take angle at E. Point E is the touch point on BC. The lines IE is perpendicular to BC. Also, ED and EF are lines from E to D and E to F. Let me see.

Since D lies on AB and F lies on AC, then ED connects D (on AB) to E (on BC), and EF connects E (on BC) to F (on AC). So, triangle DEF has vertices on the sides of ABC.

To compute angle at E, which is angle DEF. Wait, the problem says angle DEF is 52 degrees. So angle at E in triangle DEF is 52 degrees. How can we express that in terms of angles of ABC?

Let me try to find expressions for angles of DEF. For example, angle at E (DEF) can be found by considering the lines ED and EF. Let me think about the directions of ED and EF.

Since ID is perpendicular to AB and IE is perpendicular to BC. Let me consider the direction of ED. From point E (touch point on BC), line ED goes towards D on AB. Similarly, line EF goes towards F on AC.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Suppose triangle ABC with incenter I. Let me assume coordinates such that I is at origin (0,0), but maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, use barycentric coordinates, but that might be too involved.

Wait, here's a better idea. Since ID, IE, IF are radii and perpendicular to the sides, then the lines ID, IE, IF are perpendicular to AB, BC, AC respectively. Thus, the angles between these radii correspond to angles between the sides of ABC.

Alternatively, since DEF is the contact triangle, the angles of DEF can be determined using the formula involving the angles of ABC. Let me search my mind for that formula. 

I recall that in the contact triangle, each angle is equal to π/2 minus half the corresponding angle of the original triangle. Wait, not sure. Let me think again. 

Take angle at E in DEF. At point E, which is the touch point on BC. The lines ED and EF meet at E. The line IE is perpendicular to BC. Now, ED connects E to D on AB, and EF connects E to F on AC. Let me consider the angles around E.

At point E, the line IE is perpendicular to BC. Also, the lines ED and EF form angles with IE. Let me consider triangle IDE and IFE. Since ID and IE are radii, they are equal in length. However, maybe that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, let's note that in triangle ABC, the distances from the inradius r. The points D, E, F divide the sides into segments. For example, AD = AF = (AB + AC - BC)/2. But maybe that's not immediately useful.

Wait, another thought: The triangle DEF is called the incentral triangle, and its angles can be computed as follows. The angles of DEF are π - 2α', where α' is the angle between the internal angle bisector and the side. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, consider that the angles of DEF are related to the angles of ABC via the formula:

∠DEF = 90° - (∠ABC)/2

Wait, let me test this. Suppose ∠ABC is β. Then, since IE is perpendicular to BC, and E is the touch point. The line ED connects E to D on AB. What's the angle between ED and IE?

Wait, maybe using the fact that in triangle IDE, which is right-angled at D because ID is perpendicular to AB. Similarly, triangle IEF is right-angled at F. So, maybe angle between ED and EF can be found by combining angles from these right triangles.

Alternatively, consider that in triangle DEF, angle at E is formed by lines ED and EF. These lines are connected to points D and F, which lie on AB and AC. 

Wait, here's a method: The points D, E, F are the feet of the inradius. So, the lines ED and EF can be considered as lines from E to the touch points on AB and AC. Maybe using the fact that in triangle ABC, the angles at D, E, F relate to the angles of ABC.

Alternatively, think of the angles of triangle DEF. Let me consider that angle at E (which is angle DEF) is equal to 90° minus half of angle B. Wait, why? Because IE is perpendicular to BC, and the angle between IE and BE is half of angle B. Wait, not sure.

Wait, since I is the incenter, the angles between the angle bisectors. For example, angle BIE is equal to 90° + (∠A)/2. Wait, yes! There's a formula for angles at the incenter. The measure of angle BIE is 90° plus half of angle A. Wait, let me verify that.

In triangle ABC, the incenter I. The angles at the incenter can be calculated. For example, angle BIC equals 90° + (∠A)/2. Similarly, angle BIC = 90° + (α)/2, where α is angle A. Wait, is that correct?

Yes, I remember that formula. For example, angle BIC = 90° + (α)/2. Similarly, angle BIC = 180° - (∠B + ∠C)/2 = 180° - (180° - α)/2 = 180° - 90° + α/2 = 90° + α/2. Yes, that's correct.

So angle BIC = 90° + α/2. But how does that relate to our problem?

Wait, in our case, angle DEF is given as 52°, which is angle at E in triangle DEF. Let me try to express angle DEF in terms of angles of ABC.

Looking at triangle DEF. Let me consider the lines DE and FE. Since D is on AB, E is on BC, F is on AC. So, angle at E is between ED and EF. 

Now, since IE is perpendicular to BC, and ED connects to D on AB, and EF connects to F on AC. Let me think about the angles between ED and IE, and between EF and IE.

Since ID is perpendicular to AB, and IE is perpendicular to BC. Let me consider the angle between ED and IE. 

From point E, line ED goes to D on AB. Since ID is perpendicular to AB, then ED forms some angle with ID. Similarly, EF forms some angle with IE.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me place triangle ABC such that BC is horizontal, and I is somewhere inside. But this might get complicated without knowing specific lengths.

Wait, here's another idea. The triangle DEF is similar to the medial triangle? No, not necessarily. But maybe there's a relation between their angles.

Alternatively, since DEF is the contact triangle, the angles of DEF can be expressed in terms of the angles of ABC. Let me try to derive one of them.

Consider angle at E (angle DEF). This angle is formed by the lines ED and EF. Let me consider the lines ED and EF. Since D is on AB and F is on AC, and E is on BC.

Now, from point E, the line ED meets AB at D, and line EF meets AC at F. Let me consider the angles between ED and EF. 

But how do these relate to the angles of ABC? Let me think about the slopes or directions of these lines. Alternatively, using vectors.

Alternatively, since IE is perpendicular to BC, and ID is perpendicular to AB, and IF is perpendicular to AC. Let me consider the angles between these perpendiculars.

For example, angle between IE and ID. Since IE is perpendicular to BC and ID is perpendicular to AB. So the angle between IE and ID is equal to the angle between BC and AB. Which is angle B. Wait, because if two lines are perpendicular to two other lines, then the angle between them is equal to the angle between the original lines.

Yes, that seems correct. So, angle between IE and ID is equal to angle B. Because IE ⊥ BC and ID ⊥ AB, so angle between IE and ID is same as angle between BC and AB, which is angle B.

Similarly, the angle between IE and IF would be equal to angle C, since IF ⊥ AC and IE ⊥ BC.

But how does that help us with angle DEF?

Wait, angle DEF is the angle at E between ED and EF. Let me consider triangle IDE and IFE. Wait, but not sure.

Alternatively, since angle between IE and ID is angle B. And ED is part of the line from E to D. Let me imagine extending IE to meet AB at some point? Wait, no, IE is already perpendicular to BC.

Wait, maybe considering triangle EID. Since ID is perpendicular to AB, and IE is perpendicular to BC. The angle between ID and IE is angle B. But in triangle EID, we have two sides ID and IE which are radii of the incircle. Wait, but ID and IE are both radii, so they are equal in length. So triangle IDE is isoceles with ID=IE, and the angle between them being angle B. So, angle at E in triangle IDE is (180° - angle B)/2.

But wait, angle at E in triangle IDE is angle IED. Let me clarify. In triangle IDE, we have points I, D, E. ID and IE are legs of a right triangle? No, because ID is perpendicular to AB, and IE is perpendicular to BC. Unless AB and BC are perpendicular, which they aren't generally.

Wait, this approach may not be straightforward. Let me think differently.

We know that angle DEF = 52°, and we need to relate this to angle A. Let me recall that in the contact triangle DEF, the angles are related to the angles of ABC. 

After some research in my mind, I recall that the angles of the contact triangle DEF are equal to π/2 - (original angles)/2. Wait, let me check. For example, angle at D in DEF would be π/2 - (β)/2, angle at E would be π/2 - (γ)/2, and angle at F would be π/2 - (α)/2. But adding up these angles would give 3π/2 - (α+β+γ)/2 = 3π/2 - π/2 = π, which works. So that suggests that each angle of DEF is π/2 - half the opposite angle of ABC. Wait, but how does that fit?

Wait, suppose angle at D in DEF is π/2 - (β)/2, angle at E is π/2 - (γ)/2, angle at F is π/2 - (α)/2. Then sum is π/2*3 - (α+β+γ)/2 = 3π/2 - π/2 = π, which is correct. So angle DEF would be π/2 - (γ)/2, assuming angle at E corresponds to angle γ. Wait, but in triangle ABC, angle at E would be angle B, but in triangle DEF, angle at E is angle DEF. Wait, confusion arises here. Let me re-examine.

Actually, the contact triangle DEF has vertices at the touch points. So, the angle at E in DEF corresponds to the angle between the lines ED and EF. To find this angle, we need to relate it to the angles of ABC.

Let me think again. Since IE is perpendicular to BC, and ED connects E to D on AB, and EF connects E to F on AC. So, at point E, we have line IE perpendicular to BC. Also, the lines ED and EF make certain angles with IE.

Let me consider the direction of ED and EF. Since D is on AB and F is on AC, then ED is going from E (on BC) to D (on AB), and EF is going from E (on BC) to F (on AC).

The angle between ED and EF at E is angle DEF. To find this angle, perhaps we can express it in terms of the angles of ABC.

Let me consider that the lines ED and EF are the lines from E to the touch points on AB and AC. These lines are related to the angle bisectors. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the incenter I lies on the angle bisectors. So, line EI is the angle bisector of angle B. Wait, no. Wait, I is the incenter, so it lies on the angle bisectors of all three angles. So, line BI is the angle bisector of angle B, and line EI is along BI, since E is on BC. Wait, no. Wait, E is the touch point on BC, so IE is perpendicular to BC. So IE is perpendicular to BC, hence, IE is the altitude from I to BC, but since I is the incenter, IE is also along the angle bisector of angle B. Because the incenter lies on the angle bisector of angle B, so line BI is the angle bisector, and since IE is perpendicular to BC, then the angle between BI and BC is angle between BI and BC, which is half of angle B. 

This seems promising. Let me formalize this.

At point E, IE is perpendicular to BC. Also, BI is the angle bisector of angle B. So, the angle between BI and BC is half of angle B. Let me denote angle ABC as β. Then, the angle between BI and BC is β/2. But IE is perpendicular to BC, so the angle between BI and IE is 90° - β/2.

Similarly, the line ED connects E to D on AB. Since D is the touch point on AB, and ID is perpendicular to AB. So, the line ID is perpendicular to AB. Similarly, the line BI is the angle bisector of angle B, so the angle between BI and AB is β/2. 

Therefore, the angle between ID and BI would be β/2. Wait, because ID is perpendicular to AB, and BI is making an angle of β/2 with AB. So, the angle between BI and ID would be 90° - β/2, similar to earlier.

But how does this relate to angle DEF?

Let me consider triangle IDE. In this triangle, we have ID and IE as radii of the incircle, so they are equal in length. So triangle IDE is isoceles with ID = IE. The base angles at D and E would be equal. Wait, but earlier we said the angle between BI and IE is 90° - β/2. Wait, maybe I need to consider the angles within triangle IDE.

Alternatively, since angle between BI and BC is β/2, and IE is perpendicular to BC, then angle between BI and IE is 90° - β/2. Similarly, the angle between BI and ID is β/2 (since ID is perpendicular to AB, and BI is the angle bisector of angle B, making angle β/2 with AB). 

But this seems getting tangled. Perhaps I should use coordinates. Let me set up coordinate system.

Let me place point B at (0,0), point C at (c,0), and point A somewhere in the plane. The incenter I has coordinates based on the sides. But this might be too calculation-heavy without specific values.

Alternatively, consider the fact that in triangle DEF, angle at E is 52°, and we want to relate that to angle A. Let me use the formula I thought before: angle DEF = π/2 - (γ)/2, where γ is angle at C. Wait, but earlier assumption was angle at E in DEF is π/2 - γ/2. If that's true, then:

Given angle DEF = 52° = π/2 - γ/2 → converting to degrees, 52 = 90 - γ/2 → γ/2 = 38 → γ = 76°. So angle C is 76°. Then, since angles in triangle ABC add up to 180°, we have α + β + γ = 180°. But how does that help us find angle A?

Wait, but we don't know anything about angle B or angle C yet. But if angle DEF = 90 - γ/2, then angle C is 76°, as above. But then, how do we find angle A?

Wait, unless there's another relation. Wait, if angle DEF is related to angle C, then angle at E in DEF is related to angle C. But what about angle at D and F?

Alternatively, if angle DEF is related to angle B, or angle A?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in associating angle DEF with angle C. Let me reconsider.

In triangle ABC, the contact triangle DEF has its angles related to the angles of ABC. Let me refer back to the formula. For instance, angle at D in DEF is equal to π/2 - (angle B)/2. Angle at E is π/2 - (angle C)/2, and angle at F is π/2 - (angle A)/2. Then, the sum of angles in DEF is π/2 * 3 - (A + B + C)/2 = 3π/2 - π/2 = π, which checks out.

Thus, angle at E (which is angle DEF) is π/2 - (angle C)/2. Given that angle DEF is 52°, we have:

52° = 90° - (angle C)/2 → angle C = (90° - 52°)*2 = 38° * 2 = 76°. So angle C is 76°.

Then, since the sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180°, we have angle A + angle B + angle C = 180°. But we still need more info to find angle A. However, there's another relation. 

Wait, the problem gives us that angle DEF is 52°, leading us to angle C = 76°. But how do we find angle A? Is there another relation involving angle A?

Wait, perhaps angle at F in DEF is π/2 - (angle A)/2. But we don't know angle at F. But we could write equations for angles of DEF:

angle D + angle E + angle F = 180°

Which becomes:

[π/2 - (angle B)/2] + [π/2 - (angle C)/2] + [π/2 - (angle A)/2] = π

As before, which simplifies correctly. But since we know angle E (DEF) is 52°, which is π/2 - (angle C)/2, giving us angle C = 76°, but we need another equation to find angle A. However, there might be another condition.

Wait, but what if angle at D or angle at F relates to other angles? Without more information, we cannot determine angle A directly. But the problem states that angle DEF is 52°, and asks for angle A. This implies that there is enough information to determine angle A uniquely. Hence, there must be another relation that I'm missing.

Wait, perhaps there's a property I haven't considered yet. Let me think again. Since DEF is the contact triangle, and angle at E is related to angle C, but what about the other angles?

Alternatively, perhaps angle at D is related to angle B, and angle at F is related to angle A. If we can find another angle in DEF, we can set up equations. But we only know one angle.

Wait, but maybe there's symmetry or other constraints. Wait, if we can find the other angles in DEF, but without more data, it's impossible. Unless there's an implicit relation. Wait, but the problem doesn't provide other angles of DEF, only one. So how can we proceed?

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the formula. Let me double-check the relationship between the contact triangle's angles and the original triangle's angles.

An alternative approach: In triangle ABC, the contact triangle DEF. Let me consider the angles of DEF. Since D, E, F are points of tangency, the lines from D, E, F to I are perpendicular to the sides. So, the lines ID, IE, IF are perpendicular to AB, BC, CA respectively.

Now, consider triangle IDE. It has ID ⊥ AB and IE ⊥ BC. So, the angle between ID and IE is equal to the angle between AB and BC, which is angle B. Hence, in triangle IDE, the angle at I is angle B. Wait, no. Wait, angle between ID and IE is equal to the angle between AB and BC, which is angle B. But triangle IDE has angle at I equal to angle between ID and IE, which is angle B. Since ID and IE are perpendicular to AB and BC respectively, the angle between them is indeed angle B.

In triangle IDE, we have angle at I equal to angle B, and sides ID and IE are equal (both are radii of the incircle). So triangle IDE is isoceles with ID=IE and vertex angle B. Therefore, the base angles at D and E are equal. Let's call them x. So:

angle at I: B  
angles at D and E: x each  
Thus, B + 2x = 180°  
=> x = (180° - B)/2  

But what is x? The angle at D in triangle IDE is angle IDE. But angle IDE is adjacent to angle D in DEF. Wait, not sure.

Wait, angle IDE is part of angle at D in triangle DEF. Let me think. Point D is connected to E and F in triangle DEF. So, angle at D in DEF is angle EDF. But how does it relate to triangle IDE?

Alternatively, focusing on angle at E in triangle IDE, which is x = (180° - B)/2. But angle at E in triangle IDE is angle IED, which is adjacent to angle DEF. Let me try to visualize.

At point E, we have several angles: angle IED (from triangle IDE), angle IEF (from triangle IEF), and angle DEF (the angle we care about). 

Wait, angle DEF is the angle between ED and EF at point E. Let me consider that line ED is part of triangle IDE, and line EF is part of triangle IEF. So, the total angle at E (angle DEF) would be the sum of angles IED and IEF, or something like that?

No, because ED and EF are two separate lines from E. The angle between ED and EF is angle DEF. However, IE is perpendicular to BC, and ED and EF are connected to D and F. 

Alternatively, since in triangle IDE, angle at E is x = (180° - B)/2. Similarly, in triangle IEF, angle at E would be y = (180° - C)/2, since IE is perpendicular to BC and IF is perpendicular to AC, so angle between IE and IF is angle C, making triangle IEF isoceles with angle at I equal to C, and base angles y = (180° - C)/2.

Wait, if angle between IE and IF is angle C, then in triangle IEF, which has IE=IF (radii), the base angles at E and F would be (180° - C)/2. So, angle at E in triangle IEF is (180° - C)/2.

Now, at point E, the angle between ED and EF is angle DEF, which is composed of angle IED (from triangle IDE) and angle IEF (from triangle IEF)? No, because IE is a common side. Wait, at point E, the lines ED and EF meet. The line IE splits the angle at E into two parts: one between ED and IE, and another between IE and EF. So, angle DEF = angle between ED and EF = angle IED + angle IEF.

Wait, no. Because angle between ED and IE is x = (180° - B)/2, and angle between IE and EF is y = (180° - C)/2. So, total angle at E (angle DEF) is x + y = [(180° - B)/2] + [(180° - C)/2] = [360° - B - C]/2 = 180° - (B + C)/2.

But in triangle ABC, B + C = 180° - A. So substituting:

angle DEF = 180° - (180° - A)/2 = 180° - 90° + A/2 = 90° + A/2.

Wait, but according to this derivation, angle DEF = 90° + A/2. But in the problem statement, angle DEF is 52°, which would imply:

90° + A/2 = 52° → A/2 = -38° → A = -76°, which is impossible. Clearly, there's a mistake in this derivation.

Hmm, this indicates an error in my reasoning. Let me go back.

Earlier, I assumed that angle between IE and IF is angle C. But IE is perpendicular to BC, and IF is perpendicular to AC. So, the angle between IE and IF is the angle between two lines perpendicular to BC and AC, respectively. Which would be equal to the angle between BC and AC, which is angle C. Wait, no. If two lines are perpendicular to BC and AC, then the angle between them is equal to the angle between BC and AC, which is angle C. Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Suppose we have two lines: one is perpendicular to BC, and the other is perpendicular to AC. The angle between these two lines is equal to the angle between BC and AC. Because if you have two lines, their perpendiculars will form the same angle. So, yes, the angle between IE (perp to BC) and IF (perp to AC) is equal to the angle between BC and AC, which is angle C. So, in triangle IEF, which has sides IE and IF (equal radii), the angle at I is angle C. Hence, the base angles at E and F are (180° - C)/2 each.

Similarly, in triangle IDE, the angle at I is angle B, so the base angles at D and E are (180° - B)/2.

Now, at point E, the angle between ED and EF is angle DEF, which is the sum of the angles between ED and IE, and between IE and EF. Wait, no. If you have ED and EF meeting at E, and IE is a line from E to I, then angle DEF is split into two angles by IE: one between ED and IE, and another between IE and EF. So, angle DEF = angle between ED and IE + angle between IE and EF.

From triangle IDE, the angle at E (between ED and IE) is (180° - B)/2.

From triangle IEF, the angle at E (between IE and EF) is (180° - C)/2.

Thus, angle DEF = [(180° - B)/2] + [(180° - C)/2] = [360° - B - C]/2 = 180° - (B + C)/2.

But in triangle ABC, B + C = 180° - A. Substituting:

angle DEF = 180° - (180° - A)/2 = 180° - 90° + A/2 = 90° + A/2.

But this leads to angle DEF = 90° + A/2. According to the problem, angle DEF is 52°, which would mean:

90° + A/2 = 52° ⇒ A/2 = -38° ⇒ A = -76°, which is impossible. This contradiction suggests that my earlier assumption is wrong.

Where is the mistake here? Let me check again.

Ah! Wait, the angle between IE and IF is not angle C. Because IE is perpendicular to BC, and IF is perpendicular to AC. So, the angle between IE and IF is supplementary to angle C. Let me explain.

Imagine two lines: one is perpendicular to BC (IE), and the other is perpendicular to AC (IF). The angle between these two lines depends on the orientation. If angle between BC and AC is angle C, then the angle between their perpendiculars would be 180° - angle C. Because if two lines intersect, the angle between their perpendiculars is either equal or supplementary depending on the direction. 

Wait, suppose two lines intersect at an angle θ. Then, the angle between their perpendiculars would be θ or 180° - θ, depending on which way you draw the perpendiculars. So, in this case, if angle between BC and AC is angle C, then the angle between their perpendiculars (IE and IF) would be 180° - angle C. Hence, in triangle IEF, the angle at I is 180° - angle C, not angle C. This changes the previous calculation.

So, correcting this:

In triangle IEF, the angle at I is 180° - angle C. Since IE and IF are radii, triangle IEF is isoceles with IE = IF. Hence, the base angles at E and F are (180° - (180° - C))/2 = C/2 each.

Similarly, in triangle IDE, the angle at I is 180° - angle B, making the base angles at D and E each equal to (180° - (180° - B))/2 = B/2.

So, at point E, the angle between ED and IE is B/2, and the angle between IE and EF is C/2. Hence, angle DEF = B/2 + C/2 = (B + C)/2.

But in triangle ABC, B + C = 180° - A, so angle DEF = (180° - A)/2 = 90° - A/2.

Given that angle DEF is 52°, we have:

90° - A/2 = 52°  
=> A/2 = 90° - 52° = 38°  
=> A = 76°.

Thus, angle A is 76°, which corresponds to choice C.

Wait, this makes sense! Earlier mistake was assuming the angle between IE and IF was angle C instead of 180° - C. Correcting that led to angle DEF = (B + C)/2 = (180° - A)/2 = 90° - A/2. Solving 90° - A/2 = 52° gives A = 76°, which is option C.

Therefore, the measure of angle A is 76°, so the answer is C.
