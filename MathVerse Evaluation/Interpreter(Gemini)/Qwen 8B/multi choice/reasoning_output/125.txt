QUESTION:
As shown in a sector iron sheet OAB, it is known that OA = 30.0, angle AOB = 120.0, the worker master combines OA and OB to form a conical chimney cap (the joints are ignored), then the radius of the bottom circle of the chimney cap is ()

CHOICES:
A:5cm
B:12cm
C:10cm
D:15cm

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a sector OAB where OA and OB are both 30 units long, and the angle at O is 120 degrees. The worker forms a cone by joining OA and OB, making a conical chimney cap. We need to find the radius of the base of this cone.

First, I remember that when you make a cone from a sector, the radius of the original sector becomes the slant height of the cone. Here, OA and OB are radii of the sector, so they should be the slant height (l) of the cone. Given OA = 30, so l = 30.

Next, the circumference of the base of the cone relates to the arc length of the sector. The arc AB of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let me recall the formula for the arc length. Arc length (L) is θ times r, where θ is the central angle in radians. But here, the angle is given in degrees, so I need to convert that.

Original angle AOB is 120 degrees. To convert to radians, multiply by π/180. So θ_rad = 120 * π/180 = (2π)/3 radians. Then arc length L = θ_rad * R, where R is the radius of the sector, which is 30. So L = (2π/3)*30 = 20π.

This arc length becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. The circumference of a circle is 2πr, where r is the radius of the base of the cone. Setting them equal: 2πr = 20π. Dividing both sides by 2π gives r = 10. So the radius of the base is 10 cm. Looking at the options, that's choice C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The sector's radius is the slant height of the cone, yes. The arc length becomes the circumference. So calculations seem right. 120 degrees converted properly. Yes, 120*(π/180)= 2π/3. Multiply by 30 gives 20π. Divide by 2π gives 10. So answer is C, 10 cm.
