MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, the question says that lines a and b are intercepted by line c, and they mention that line b is parallel to line a. Wait, actually, wait—the given predicates say Parallel(a,b). So line a is parallel to line b. Then there's angle 1 which measures 50 degrees, and we need to find angle 2.

First, I need to visualize the setup. Since lines a and b are cut by line c, which is another transversal. Because a and b are parallel, and c is a transversal, so we have some corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, maybe consecutive interior angles here.

But the problem mentions angle 1 and angle 2. Let me think about how these angles are positioned. In typical parallel line problems, when a transversal crosses two parallel lines, several pairs of angles are formed. For example, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

Now, the measure of angle 1 is given as 50 degrees. Depending on where angle 1 and angle 2 are located, their relationship changes. But since the problem refers to them as angle 1 and angle 2, perhaps they are related via one of these properties.

Wait, if angle 1 is one of the angles formed by the transversal c with line a or b, then angle 2 could be either a corresponding, alternate, or consecutive angle. Let me try to sketch mentally.

Assuming that angle 1 is on line a and angle 2 is on line b. Since lines a and b are parallel, if angle 1 is, say, an alternate interior angle with angle 2, then they would be equal. Alternatively, if they are consecutive interior angles, they would add up to 180 degrees. Or if they are corresponding angles, they'd be equal.

But without seeing the diagram, I need to rely on standard configurations. However, the problem states that angle 1 is 50 degrees. Let me consider common scenarios. Suppose angle 1 is an acute angle formed by the transversal c with line a. Then angle 2 could be its corresponding angle on line b, making it also 50 degrees. But that would make answer A. However, sometimes angle 2 might be a vertical angle or something else.

Alternatively, if angle 1 is on one side, and angle 2 is on the other side. For instance, if angle 1 is an interior angle on one side, then angle 2 could be an exterior angle. Wait, but depending on the position, maybe they are supplementary.

Another possibility: if angle 1 is a corresponding angle to angle 2, then they're equal. If they are same-side interior angles, then they sum to 180. But the problem doesn't specify the exact positions, but in many standard problems, angle 1 and angle 2 are often set up such that they are supplementary. For example, if angle 1 is an interior angle and angle 2 is an exterior angle on the same side, then they'd add up to 180. 

Wait, but the problem says that a and b are intercepted by line c. So line c is a transversal cutting lines a and b. Therefore, there are eight angles formed. Now, angle 1 and angle 2 could be different types. But given that angle 1 is 50 degrees, and assuming that angle 2 is a consecutive interior angle, then angle 2 would be 180 - 50 = 130 degrees, which would be answer B. But if they are alternate interior angles, then angle 2 would be 50 degrees, answer A. 

So how do I know which one it is? The problem mentions that line b is parallel to line a. So the key is to identify the relationship between angle 1 and angle 2. Without the diagram, it's a bit ambiguous, but typically in such problems, angle 1 and angle 2 are considered to be consecutive interior angles. For example, if angle 1 is on line a and angle 2 is on line b, both on the same side of the transversal, then they would be consecutive interior angles. Hence, adding up to 180 degrees. Thus, angle 2 would be 130 degrees, which is answer B. 

Alternatively, if angle 1 and angle 2 are vertical angles or corresponding, they'd be equal. But given that the options include 50 and 130, and the presence of parallel lines, it's more likely that they are consecutive interior angles. Therefore, angle 2 would be 130 degrees. So the answer should be B.
