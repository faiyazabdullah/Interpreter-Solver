MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have points A, B, and C all on a circle with center O. The measure of arc AC is 122 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle B, which is angle ABC. 

First, I remember that when dealing with circles and angles, there are some key theorems. One important one is about inscribed angles. An inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted arc. Also, if a triangle is inscribed in a circle where one side is the diameter, then the angle opposite that side is a right angle. But here, the given angle is ABC, so maybe it's an inscribed angle intercepting some arc?

Wait, the problem mentions that angle ABC is inscribed in the circle. Wait, but angle ABC is formed by three points on the circle. Let me visualize this. Points A, B, and C are all on the circle. So triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle. Now, angle at B, which is angle ABC, would intercept an arc. Which arc? In an inscribed angle, the angle intercepts the arc opposite to it. So angle ABC intercepts arc AC. Because the vertex is at B, so the sides BA and BC go to A and C, so the intercepted arc is AC. 

But wait, according to the given, the measure of arc AC is 122 degrees. And the problem states that the measure of angle ABC is half of the measure of arc AC. Wait, the predicate says Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C)), HalfOf(MeasureOf(Arc(A,C)))). So that directly gives us that angle ABC is half of 122 degrees. That would make angle ABC equal to 61 degrees. But let me check again because sometimes arcs can be major or minor arcs. 

But since they mentioned the radius angle of AC is 122 degrees. Wait, maybe that refers to the central angle? Wait, the term "radius angle" isn't standard. Maybe it's referring to the central angle subtended by arc AC. Since the points are on the circle, the central angle would correspond to the arc AC. So if the central angle is 122 degrees, then the arc AC measures 122 degrees. Then, the inscribed angle over the same arc would be half that. So angle ABC, being an inscribed angle intercepting arc AC, should be half of 122, which is 61 degrees. Therefore, the measure of angle B is 61 degrees. Looking at the options, that's choice C. 

Wait, but let me confirm. Another thought: if the arc AC is 122 degrees, then depending on where point B is located, could there be another arc? For example, if B is on the opposite side, maybe the arc AC that's intercepted is actually the rest of the circle. But the problem says that the measure of arc AC is 122 degrees, so that's probably the arc that's less than 180 degrees unless specified otherwise. However, in the case of an inscribed angle, the intercepted arc is the arc that's not containing the angle. Wait, no. The inscribed angle intercepts the arc that's opposite. So if B is on the circumference, then the intercepted arc is AC, which is 122 degrees. Thus, the angle at B would be half of that. 

Therefore, angle B is 61 degrees. So the answer should be C.
