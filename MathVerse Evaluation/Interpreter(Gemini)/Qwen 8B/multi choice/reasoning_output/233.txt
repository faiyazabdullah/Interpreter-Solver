MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have an isosceles triangle RST. The given information says that angle SRT is 70 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle RST. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I should recall what an isosceles triangle is. An isosceles triangle has two sides that are equal in length, and the angles opposite those sides are also equal. The problem mentions that the triangle RST is isosceles, and specifically, the lengths of RS and RT are equal because they say Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(R,T))). Wait, actually, looking back at the given predicates, there's a statement that Equals(LengthOf(Line(R,S)), LengthOf(Line(R,T))), so that means sides RS and RT are equal. Therefore, the triangle has two equal sides: RS and RT. 

Now, in an isosceles triangle, the base angles are equal. But wait, which angles are those? The base angles are the ones opposite the equal sides. Wait, if RS and RT are equal, then the base would be ST, and the two equal sides are RS and RT. That means the base angles would be angles at S and T. Wait, noâ€”wait, let me think again. In a triangle, the angles opposite equal sides are equal. So if RS = RT, then the angles opposite them would be equal. The side RS is opposite angle T, and the side RT is opposite angle S. Wait, no. Let me clarify: In triangle RST, each side is named by its opposite vertex. So side RS is opposite angle T, side RT is opposite angle S, and side ST is opposite angle R. So if RS equals RT, then the angles opposite them, which are angles T and S respectively, are equal. Therefore, angles at S and T are equal. 

Wait, but the problem states that MeasureOf(Angle(S,R,T)) is 70 degrees. Let me parse that. Angle(S,R,T) is the angle at point R, between points S and T. So that's angle at R, which is angle SRT. So angle at R is 70 degrees. Since the triangle is isosceles with RS = RT, the base angles are at S and T, which are equal. 

So the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. So angle at R is 70 degrees, and the other two angles (at S and T) are equal. Let's call each of those angles x. Then:

70 + x + x = 180  
70 + 2x = 180  
2x = 110  
x = 55  

Therefore, each of the base angles (angles at S and T) is 55 degrees. But the question asks for angle RST. Wait, angle RST is the angle at point S. Because angle RST is formed by points R, S, T, so it's the angle at S. Which is one of the base angles, so it's 55 degrees. 

Looking at the answer choices, A is 55. So the answer should be A. Let me check again to make sure I didn't mix up the angles. 

Angle SRT is at R, which is given as 70 degrees. The triangle is isosceles with RS = RT, so sides RS and RT are equal. Thus, angles opposite these sides are equal. The side RS is opposite angle T, and RT is opposite angle S. So angles at S and T are equal. Hence, angles at S and T are each 55 degrees. Therefore, angle RST is angle at S, which is 55 degrees. Yes, that seems correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I confused the labeling. Let me visualize the triangle. Points R, S, T. The triangle is RST. The sides RS and RT are equal. So vertex R is connected to S and T, with RS = RT. Therefore, the triangle is symmetric about the altitude from R to ST. Therefore, angles at S and T are equal. So angle at S (RST) is equal to angle at T (RTS). Given angle at R is 70, so the other two angles sum to 110, each being 55. Therefore, angle RST is 55 degrees. So answer A.
