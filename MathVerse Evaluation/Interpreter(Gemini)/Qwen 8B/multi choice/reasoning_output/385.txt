MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, we have a right-angled triangle where one of the acute angles is 30 degrees, and one leg is √10. We need to find the length of another side, denoted as x. 

First, I'll recall some properties of right-angled triangles, especially those with a 30-degree angle. In a right-angled triangle, if one of the angles is 30 degrees, the sides are in a specific ratio. From what I remember, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, and 90° are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. That means the side opposite 30° is the shortest one, then the other leg is √3 times longer, and the hypotenuse is twice the shortest side.

But wait, the problem mentions that one leg is √10. Let me make sure which leg that is. Since it's a right-angled triangle, there are two legs and a hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is always opposite the right angle, so the other two sides are the legs. Now, the problem states that one of the acute angles is 30°, so the sides adjacent to that angle would be the legs. Let me visualize the triangle: suppose angle at T3 is the right angle, making T1-T3 and T2-T3 the legs, and T1-T2 the hypotenuse? Wait, but the predicates mention IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2),Triangle(...)), so Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the hypotenuse is between points T1 and T2. Then the legs are T1-T3 and T2-T3. 

Given that, the right angle is at T3 because the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Wait, no. Wait, in a triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So if the hypotenuse is Line(T1,T2), then the right angle must be at T3. Because the hypotenuse connects the two vertices that aren't the right angle. So, the right angle is at T3. Therefore, the legs are T1-T3 and T2-T3. 

Now, the problem says MeasureOf(Angle(T3,T2,T1),30). Let me parse that. Angle(T3,T2,T1) is the angle at point T2, between points T3, T2, T1. So that angle is at vertex T2. So angle at T2 is 30 degrees. Since the triangle is right-angled at T3, the angles at T1 and T2 must add up to 90 degrees. One of them is 30°, so the other must be 60°. Therefore, angle at T1 is 60°, angle at T2 is 30°, right angle at T3.

So, in such a triangle, the sides opposite these angles would follow the ratios. The side opposite the 30° angle is the shorter leg. Which angle is which? Let's see. The angle at T2 is 30°, so the side opposite to that angle would be T1-T3. Wait, because the angle at T2 is formed by sides T2-T3 and T2-T1. The side opposite to angle T2 is T1-T3. So T1-T3 is opposite the 30° angle. Therefore, that should be the shorter leg. 

Alternatively, maybe I should label the sides properly. Let me assign labels. Let's denote:

- Right angle at T3.
- Hypotenuse is T1-T2 (since IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2), Triangle(...))).
- Therefore, the legs are T1-T3 and T2-T3. 
- The angle at T2 is 30°, so the side opposite to T2 is T1-T3. So T1-T3 is opposite the 30° angle. Therefore, that side is the shorter leg. The other leg is T2-T3, which is adjacent to the 30° angle. 

Wait, but the problem states LengthOf(Line(T2,T3),x). So the length of T2-T3 is x. And LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)). Wait, the hypotenuse is Line(T1,T2), whose length is sqrt(10)? Or is that the length of another side?

Wait, the predicate says LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)). So the hypotenuse has length sqrt(10). But according to the standard 30-60-90 triangle ratios, if the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Wait, let me clarify.

In a 30-60-90 triangle:

- The side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, let's call it 'a'.
- The side opposite 60° is longer leg, 'a√3'.
- The hypotenuse is '2a'.

So here, since angle at T2 is 30°, the side opposite to it (T1-T3) is the shorter leg. The hypotenuse is T1-T2, which is given as sqrt(10). Therefore, hypotenuse = 2a = sqrt(10). So a = sqrt(10)/2. Then the longer leg (opposite 60° angle at T1) would be a√3 = (sqrt(10)/2)*√3 = sqrt(30)/2. However, the problem asks for the length of T2-T3, which is the other leg. Wait, which leg is which?

Wait, the legs are T1-T3 and T2-T3. The hypotenuse is T1-T2. The angle at T2 is 30°, so the side opposite to that angle (which is T1-T3) is the shorter leg. Then the other leg, T2-T3, is adjacent to the 30° angle. So the longer leg is adjacent to the 30° angle? Wait, no. Wait, the longer leg is opposite the larger angle. The angles are 30°, 60°, and 90°. The side opposite 30° is shorter leg. The side opposite 60° is longer leg. The hypotenuse is opposite 90°. 

So, in our case, the angle at T2 is 30°, so the side opposite to it (T1-T3) is shorter leg. The angle at T1 is 60°, so the side opposite to it (T2-T3) is the longer leg. Therefore, the longer leg is T2-T3, which is x. So we need to find x.

We know the hypotenuse is sqrt(10). So hypotenuse = 2a, where a is the shorter leg (T1-T3). Therefore:

hypotenuse = 2a => sqrt(10) = 2a => a = sqrt(10)/2.

Then, the longer leg (T2-T3) is a√3 = (sqrt(10)/2) * sqrt(3) = sqrt(30)/2. Therefore, x equals sqrt(30)/2. But let me check again if this aligns with the given data.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning which leg is which. Let me verify using trigonometry. For angle at T2 being 30°, the adjacent side would be T2-T3 (adjacent to angle T2), and the hypotenuse is T1-T2. So cos(30°) = adjacent / hypotenuse = (T2-T3)/hypotenuse. Therefore:

cos(30°) = x / sqrt(10)

Since cos(30°) is sqrt(3)/2, so:

sqrt(3)/2 = x / sqrt(10)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(10):

x = sqrt(10) * sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(30)/2.

Yes, same result. So x is sqrt(30)/2. However, the answer options weren't listed, but the user mentioned that the answer choices are labeled A-D, but they were not provided. However, the original problem statement says "Answer Choices: No choices found." So perhaps the user intended to provide answer choices but forgot? But regardless, according to my calculation, x is sqrt(30)/2. So if the answer choices included this, then that would be the correct answer. Since the user hasn't provided options, but the system requires selecting between A-D, but without knowing the options, I can't directly choose. However, assuming that the answer is supposed to be in terms of radicals, sqrt(30)/2 is likely the answer. Hence, depending on the options, but since the user said "no choices found," perhaps the answer is simply sqrt(30)/2. But since the instruction says to pick one of the four letters, but since no options are given, perhaps the system expects me to just state the answer as per the calculation. However, the initial setup says "answer choices" are not present, but the user's last message includes "ANSWER CHOICES: No choices found." So maybe the actual answer is to be written as per the calculation, but the final answer needs to be selected as one of the four letters. But without knowing the options, how can I proceed? Maybe the original problem had options like A: sqrt(10), B: sqrt(30)/2, etc., but since it's missing, I have to assume that the answer is sqrt(30)/2. Therefore, if that's one of the options, say option B, then Final Answer: B. But since the user hasn't provided options, perhaps the answer is simply sqrt(30)/2, but the instructions require choosing between A-D. This seems conflicting. However, given that the problem is about finding x, which is the length of T2-T3, and based on the calculation, the answer is sqrt(30)/2, so I'll go with that. Assuming that option B corresponds to this, the answer would be B. Alternatively, if the options are different, but given the lack of info, I have to proceed with the calculation.
