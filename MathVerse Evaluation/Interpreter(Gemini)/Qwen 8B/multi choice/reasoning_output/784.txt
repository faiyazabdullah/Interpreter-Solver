MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have two circles, both centered at point O. The first circle (Circle 1) has a circumference of 36. The second circle (Circle 2) has a radius that's half of the radius of the first circle. The question asks for the length of the darkened arc, which I assume is the arc CD on Circle 2. 

Let me start by recalling the formula for the circumference of a circle: C = 2πr. Since the circumference of Circle 1 is 36, I can find its radius. Let me compute that first. 

Given CircumferenceOf(1) equals 36, so 2πr₁ = 36. Solving for r₁ gives r₁ = 36/(2π) = 18/π. But wait, maybe I don't need the actual numerical value yet. 

Next, the radius of the small circle (Circle 2) is half of the radius of the large one. So, radius of Circle 2, r₂ = r₁ / 2 = (18/π)/2 = 9/π. 

Now, the problem mentions points A, B on Circle 1, and points C, D on Circle 2. Also, there's an angle mentioned: Angle(A, O, B) measures 80 degrees. Since OA and OB are radii of Circle 1, they are equal in length. Therefore, triangle AOB is an isosceles triangle with OA = OB. The angle at O is 80 degrees. 

But how does this relate to the arc CD? Wait, the arc CD is part of Circle 2. Maybe there's a relationship between the angle at O and the arc CD? Let me think. 

Wait, the problem says Arc(C, D). So, that's an arc on Circle 2. To find the length of arc CD, I need the measure of the central angle subtended by CD, multiplied by the radius of Circle 2. 

But where does the 80-degree angle come into play here? Let me check the predicates again. There's also points C and D lying on Circle 2, and OC and OD are radii of Circle 2. So, angle COD would be the central angle for arc CD. However, I don't see a direct mention of angle COD. 

Wait, but perhaps there's another connection. Points A and B are on Circle 1, and OA and OB are radii. Then, since O is the center of both circles, maybe there's some relationship between angles in Circle 1 and Circle 2? 

Alternatively, maybe the angle AOB (which is 80 degrees) relates to some other angle in the diagram. For example, could there be a triangle involving points C and D connected to points A and B? Or perhaps there's an inscribed angle or something else? 

Wait, looking back at the predicates, there's a RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(O,C)), LengthOf(Line(O,A))) equals HalfOf(1). Since Line(O,A) is a radius of Circle 1 (so length r₁), and Line(O,C) is a radius of Circle 2 (so length r₂). Given that ratio is ½, which matches our earlier calculation because r₂ = r₁/2. That checks out. 

So, the key here is probably to find the measure of angle COD, which would allow us to calculate arc CD's length. But how do we find angle COD? 

Hmm. Is there any relation between angle AOB (80 degrees) and angle COD? Let me visualize the diagram. Points A and B are on Circle 1, while C and D are on Circle 2. All these points are connected via radii from O. 

Wait, unless there's a way that angle COD is related to angle AOB. For instance, if points C and D are constructed in a way that connects to points A and B? But the problem doesn't explicitly state such connections. 

Wait, but the problem says "the darkened arc" — maybe it's referring to arc CD, which is part of Circle 2. If I can find the measure of angle COD, then arc length is θ * r₂, where θ is in radians. But first, I need to find θ. 

Alternatively, if angle COD is equal to angle AOB, then the arc length would be (80 degrees) converted to radians times r₂. But why would those angles be equal? Unless there's some symmetry or construction that links them. 

Wait, but maybe angle COD is actually supplementary or complementary to angle AOB? Without more info, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, maybe there's another way. Let me re-examine all the given data. 

We know that points A and B lie on Circle 1. OA and OB are radii of Circle 1, each of length r₁. The angle between them is 80 degrees. Now, points C and D lie on Circle 2, with OC and OD being radii of Circle 2, each of length r₂ = r₁/2. 

Is there a possibility that points C and D are positioned such that angle COD corresponds to the same angle as angle AOB? Like, maybe the arcs AB and CD are related somehow? 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a triangle or quadrilateral connecting these points. For example, maybe points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral, but without knowing how they're arranged, it's unclear. 

Wait, another thought: if the angle at O between OA and OB is 80 degrees, and points C and D are on Circle 2, maybe there's an inscribed angle or something else. Alternatively, could there be a triangle involving points A, C, D? Not sure. 

Wait, maybe the arc CD is related to the angle AOB. Suppose that angle COD is equal to angle AOB, which is 80 degrees. Then, the arc length would be 80 degrees in radians times r₂. Let me try that approach. 

First, convert 80 degrees to radians: π/180 * 80 = (4π)/9 radians. Then, multiply by r₂. 

Earlier, we found that r₂ = r₁ / 2. And since the circumference of Circle 1 is 36, which is 2πr₁ = 36 → r₁ = 18/π. Thus, r₂ = 9/π. 

Then, arc length CD would be (4π/9) * (9/π) = 4. So, the length would be 4 units. Looking at the answer choices, D is 4. 

But wait, this assumes that angle COD is 80 degrees, which isn't stated directly. Why would angle COD be 80 degrees? Because the problem didn't specify that. So this assumption might be wrong. 

Hmm. Where did I get the idea that angle COD is 80 degrees? Maybe there's another relationship. Let me think again. 

Wait, the problem states that there's an arc CD. In the predicates, there's Arc(C,D), which might imply that the arc CD is part of Circle 2. But how do we determine its measure? 

Unless the arc CD corresponds to the same central angle as angle AOB. But why? Maybe there's a missing piece here. 

Wait, maybe the points C and D are constructed in such a way that the angle COD is equal to the angle AOB. For instance, if there's a rotation or reflection that maps points A and B to C and D. But without explicit information, this is speculative. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a triangle or another angle involved. For example, if lines AC and BD intersect at some point, creating certain angles. But again, without more details, this is guesswork. 

Wait, but let's consider that the problem gives a ratio between the radii. Since the radius of Circle 2 is half of Circle 1's radius, and the circumference of Circle 1 is 36, which gives us the radius of Circle 1 as 18/π. 

But perhaps the arc CD is related to the angle AOB. For example, if the arc CD is a portion of Circle 2 corresponding to the same angle as AOB. 

Alternatively, perhaps angle COD is half of angle AOB. If angle COD was 40 degrees, then the arc length would be (40° in radians)*r₂. Let's test this. 

Converting 40° to radians: π/180*40 = (2π)/9. Multiply by r₂=9/π: (2π/9)*(9/π)=2. Which is answer E. But that's just a guess. 

Alternatively, if angle COD is twice angle AOB, then 160 degrees. Converting to radians: 160*(π/180)= (4π)/9. Multiply by r₂=9/π gives 4. Again, leading to answer D. 

But why would angle COD be related to angle AOB? This seems like a stretch without more information. 

Wait, maybe there's an inscribed angle somewhere. For example, if points A and B are on Circle 1, and points C and D are on Circle 2, maybe there's an inscribed angle over arc CD that relates to angle AOB. But without knowing the configuration, it's challenging. 

Wait, perhaps the problem involves overlapping circles or some other relationship. For instance, if points C and D are the midpoints of OA and OB, but that's not stated. 

Alternatively, considering the ratio of radii, maybe the arc CD corresponds to the same angle as angle AOB scaled down. But again, without knowing the exact relationship, this is unclear. 

Wait, but maybe the key lies in the fact that points A and B are on Circle 1, and points C and D are on Circle 2, with OC and OD being radii of Circle 2. Since the radius of Circle 2 is half that of Circle 1, then if there's a transformation (like scaling) that takes Circle 1 to Circle 2, then the arc lengths would scale accordingly. 

But angle measures remain the same under scaling. So, if angle AOB is 80 degrees, and if angle COD is the same, then arc CD would be (80 degrees) * (radius of Circle 2). 

But how do we confirm that angle COD is 80 degrees? 

Wait, the problem mentions "darkened arc", which might be a specific arc. Perhaps in the original diagram, the arc CD is formed by the same central angle as angle AOB. But without seeing the diagram, this is an assumption. 

However, given that the answer options include 4, which is the result of assuming angle COD is 80 degrees, and given that the problem includes a ratio of radii, I think that's the intended approach. 

Therefore, proceeding with that assumption: angle COD is 80 degrees, so arc length is 80° * r₂. 

Convert 80 degrees to radians: 80° * (π/180) = (4π)/9 radians. 

Multiply by r₂: (4π/9) * (9/π) = 4. Hence, the arc length is 4. 

Looking at the answer choices, D is 4. So the answer should be D.
