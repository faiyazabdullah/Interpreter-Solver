QUESTION:
A polynomial function p is graphed, which goes through (-5,0), (-1.5,0), (2,0). What could be the equation of p?

CHOICES:
A:p(x)=(x+5)(2 x+3)(x-2)
B:p(x)=(x-5)(2 x-3)(x+2)
C:p(x)=(-5 x)\left(-\frac{3}{2} x\right)(2 x)
D:p(x)=(5 x)\left(\frac{3}{2} x\right)(-2 x)

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the equation of a polynomial function p that passes through the points (-5, 0), (-1.5, 0), and (2, 0). The answer choices are given as options A to D. 

First, I remember that if a polynomial has roots at certain points, those points correspond to factors of the polynomial. Since all three given points have a y-coordinate of 0, that means each of these x-values are roots of the polynomial. So, the polynomial should have factors corresponding to each root.

For example, if a polynomial has a root at x = a, then (x - a) is a factor. But wait, looking at the x-coordinates here: -5, -1.5, and 2. So, the factors would be (x + 5), because plugging in -5 gives zero, (x + 1.5) since -1.5 is the root, but maybe they want it written differently? Or perhaps they prefer integer coefficients? Let me think. 

Wait, the answer choices show different forms. For instance, option A is (x+5)(2x+3)(x-2). Let me check if these factors correspond to the roots. Let's expand each term:

For (x + 5): root at x = -5. Correct.

For (2x + 3): setting that equal to zero gives x = -3/2, which is -1.5. That's one of the given points. 

Then (x - 2): root at x = 2. Yes, that's the third point. So that seems to fit. So option A would have roots at -5, -1.5, and 2, which matches the given points. 

But let me check the other options just to be sure. Option B is (x - 5)(2x - 3)(x + 2). The roots here would be x=5, x=3/2, and x=-2. Those don't match the given points. So B is out. 

Option C: (-5x)(-3/2 x)(2x). Let's see. Each factor is linear. Let me find the roots. The first factor is -5x, so root at x=0. Second factor is -3/2 x, root at x=0 again. Third factor is 2x, root at x=0. So all roots are at zero. Not matching the given points. So C is wrong. 

Option D: (5x)(3/2 x)(-2x). Similarly, each factor is proportional to x. Roots at x=0 again. So same issue. So D is also incorrect. 

Therefore, the correct answer must be A. Wait, but let me confirm. The original points are (-5,0), (-1.5,0), (2,0). So the factors must be (x +5), (x + 1.5), and (x - 2). However, in option A, the second factor is (2x + 3). Let me check that. Solving 2x +3 =0 â†’ x = -3/2, which is indeed -1.5. So yes, that works. Therefore, option A is correct. 

So the answer is A.
