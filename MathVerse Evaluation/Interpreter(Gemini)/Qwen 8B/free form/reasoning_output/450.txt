Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is asking for the equation of a line that passes through the points (0,5) and (2.5,0). Hmm, right. Let me recall how to find the equation of a line given two points. 

First, I know that the general form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since we have two points, I can calculate the slope first. The formula for slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Let me plug in the given points here. 

The points are A(0,5) and B(2.5,0). So, substituting into the slope formula: m = (0 - 5)/(2.5 - 0) = (-5)/2.5. Calculating that gives m = -2. Wait, because dividing 5 by 2.5 is 2, but since it's negative, the slope is -2. That seems right. 

Now that I have the slope, I need to find the y-intercept, b. Since one of the points is (0,5), which is on the y-axis, the y-intercept should be 5. Because when x=0, y=b, so plugging in point A(0,5) gives y = -2*0 + b => 5 = b. Therefore, b is 5. 

Wait, let me verify with the other point to make sure. Using point B(2.5,0): y = -2*(2.5) + 5. That would be -5 +5 = 0, which matches the y-coordinate of point B. Perfect, that checks out. 

So putting it all together, the equation of the line is y = -2x + 5. Let me just confirm once more. If x=0, y=5, correct. If x=2.5, y=-5 +5=0, correct. And the slope between those two points is indeed -2. Yep, that looks solid. 

I think that's all there is to it. No need for any other theorems or predicates here since it's straightforward linear equations. The given points directly give the slope and intercept. No complications with perpendicularity or anything else. Just a simple calculation.
