Give your answer as an exact value.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the area of a shape given certain geometric predicates. Let me start by parsing all the given information.

First, the problem mentions a figure with a radius of 11 meters. The predicates include things like IsRadiusOf, LengthOf, Equals, Perpendicular, RightAngle, Arc, Sector, Square, and some operations on areas. 

Let me list out all the given predicates again to make sure I don't miss anything:

1. Circle(C): There's a circle named C.
2. IsRadiusOf(Line(A,C), Circle(C)): Line AC is a radius of circle C.
3. IsRadiusOf(Line(B,C), Circle(C)): Similarly, line BC is also a radius of circle C.
4. LengthOf(Line(A,C), 11): The length of AC is 11 meters.
5. LengthOf(Line(B,C), 11): The length of BC is also 11 meters.
6. Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))): This just confirms that AC and BC have equal lengths, which we already know from points 4 and 5.
7. Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C)): Lines AC and BC are perpendicular to each other.
8. RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B)): The angle at point C between lines CA and CB is a right angle.
9. Arc(A,B): An arc AB exists, probably part of the circle C since A and B are connected to C.
10. Sector(C,A,B): There's a sector formed by points C, A, and B.
11. Square(S): A square S exists.
12. AreaOf(S): The area of square S.
13. AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)): The area of sector CAB.
14. Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S)): Subtract the area of the square from the area of the sector.

Wait, but the question says "Find the area of the shape shown." However, there's no image provided. But based on the predicates, maybe the shape in question is the sector minus the square? Or perhaps another combination?

But first, let me visualize the setup. Points A and B are connected to point C, forming two radii of a circle with radius 11 m. Since AC and BC are both radii and are perpendicular, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at point C. Also, since AC and BC are both 11 m, it's an isosceles right-angled triangle. 

So, triangle ABC has legs of 11 m each. Then, the area of this triangle would be (11*11)/2 = 121/2 = 60.5 m². But how does this relate to the rest?

The problem also mentions a sector C, A, B. A sector of a circle is the region bounded by two radii and an arc. In this case, since AC and BC are radii, and angle ACB is a right angle (90 degrees), the sector is a quarter-circle. Because the central angle is 90 degrees, which is 1/4 of a full circle (360 degrees). Therefore, the area of the sector should be (θ/360) * πr². Here θ is 90°, so the area is (90/360)*π*(11)² = (1/4)*π*121 = 121π/4 ≈ 30.25π m².

Now, the problem also includes a square S. Wait, where is this square located? The predicate mentions Square(S), and AreaOf(S). Also, there's a subtraction operation: Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S)). So perhaps the shape in question is the sector minus the square? Or maybe the square is constructed in some way related to the sector?

Alternatively, maybe the square is referring to the square whose side is equal to the radius? But the problem states "a figure with a radius of 11 m"—so the circle has radius 11, and the square might be inscribed or something else. Alternatively, could the square be the one formed by the triangle ABC? Wait, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle, not a square. Unless they're talking about a square constructed on the hypotenuse or something else.

Wait, let me check again the predicates. The last predicate is Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S)), which suggests that the problem wants us to compute the difference between the area of the sector and the area of the square S. But what is the square S here?

Looking back, the problem says "the area of the shape shown," but without seeing the figure, we need to infer based on the predicates. Since there's a Square(S), and the other elements, maybe the square is the square with side length equal to the radius? Or perhaps the square is the square formed by connecting points A, B, C, and another point?

Alternatively, considering the sector and subtracting the square, maybe the square is the square whose sides are equal to the radius. If that's the case, then the area of the square would be 11² = 121 m². But if we subtract that from the sector area, we get 121π/4 - 121. But wait, that seems arbitrary unless there's more context.

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square inscribed in the sector? But that would depend on the specifics of the figure. However, given that the problem includes the subtraction of the area of the square from the sector, perhaps the intended shape is the segment of the circle (sector minus triangle) but here it's sector minus square. Hmm, but why square?

Wait, going back to the problem statement: the user says "A figure with a radius of 11 m. Find the area of the shape shown." Given the presence of the Square(S) and the subtraction, maybe the shape is the sector minus the square. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the square is the square constructed on the hypotenuse of triangle ABC. Let's think: triangle ABC is a right-angled isoceles triangle with legs 11, so hypotenuse AB would be sqrt(11² + 11²) = sqrt(242) = 11√2. So if the square is built on AB, its area would be (11√2)² = 242 m². But then the area of the sector is 121π/4, and subtracting that from the square would give 242 - 121π/4. But that doesn't seem directly related to the given predicates. Also, the problem mentions the square S, but it's unclear how it connects.

Wait, perhaps the square S refers to the square with side length equal to the radius, i.e., 11 m. Then AreaOf(S) would be 11² = 121. Then the area of the sector is 121π/4, so the difference would be 121π/4 - 121. Factorizing, that would be 121(π/4 - 1). But I need to confirm if that's the correct interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square formed by the two radii and the chord AB? No, that wouldn't form a square. Let me think again.

Another possibility: the problem may involve a square inside the sector. For example, imagine constructing a square such that one of its corners is at point C, and two adjacent sides lie along AC and BC. Since AC and BC are perpendicular and of equal length, this square would have sides of length 11 m. So the square would have vertices at C, A, D, E, where D is along AC extended and E is along BC extended? Wait, no—if you construct a square with sides along AC and BC, starting at point C, then the square would extend from C, with one side along AC and another along BC. But since AC and BC are already radii meeting at C, the square would have vertices at C, A, some point D, and some point E. However, since AC and BC are both length 11, the square would have sides of length 11. Thus, the square would have area 11×11=121 m². Then, the area of the sector is 121π/4, and subtracting the square gives 121π/4 - 121.

But why would the problem mention the square in this way? Maybe the shape in question is the area of the sector minus the square, which could represent some sort of circular segment with a square removed. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, the problem might be referring to the area of the sector minus the area of the square that's inscribed within the sector. However, without seeing the figure, it's challenging to be certain, but given the available predicates, this seems like a possible interpretation.

Therefore, proceeding under the assumption that the shape is the area of the sector (which is 121π/4) minus the area of the square (which is 121). Hence, the area would be 121π/4 - 121. To express this as a single term, factor out 121: 121(π/4 - 1). But maybe the problem expects the answer in terms of fractions multiplied out.

Alternatively, if the square is not the one with side 11, but another square. Wait, the problem says "a figure with a radius of 11 m", so the circle has radius 11. The square could be related to the circle in some way. But the problem doesn't specify, so we have to rely on the given predicates.

Given that there's a Square(S) mentioned, and the subtraction of AreaOf(S) from AreaOf(Sector(...)), it's likely that the square S is a separate entity. But how is it defined? The problem doesn't explicitly state how the square is related to the other elements. However, given that the only other elements are points A, B, C, and the circle, perhaps the square is constructed using those points?

Wait, if points A and B are endpoints of a diameter? No, because AC and BC are radii, so AB would be the chord connecting them. But if angle ACB is a right angle, then AB is the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle, as previously determined. So AB is 11√2. If the square were constructed on AB, then its area would be (11√2)^2 = 242. But then the sector area is 121π/4, so subtracting gives 121π/4 - 242. But again, without knowing the relation of the square to the other elements, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square whose sides are equal to the radius. So area 11²=121. Then the area of the sector is 121π/4. So the difference would be 121π/4 - 121. Which simplifies to 121(π/4 - 1). But converting that to decimals, π/4 is approximately 0.7854, so π/4 -1 is negative, giving a negative area, which doesn't make sense. Wait, that can't be. So if the sector area is less than the square's area, subtracting would yield a negative number, which isn't possible. Hence, this suggests that my assumption is wrong.

Hmm, so maybe the square is not the one with side length 11, but rather the square inscribed in the circle? Wait, but the circle has radius 11, so the diameter is 22. The largest square that can fit inside the circle would have its diagonal equal to the diameter. If the diagonal of the square is 22, then the side length s satisfies s√2 = 22 → s = 22 / √2 = 11√2. Then area of the square would be (11√2)^2 = 242. Again, same as before. Then the sector area is 121π/4, so the difference would be 121π/4 - 242. Still, depending on the value of π, this could be positive or negative. Let me calculate approximate numbers:

π ≈ 3.1416, so 121π/4 ≈ 121 * 0.7854 ≈ 95.07. Then 95.07 - 242 ≈ -146.93. Negative area again. Not possible. So that can't be right.

This suggests that my initial assumption about the square is incorrect. Perhaps the square is not related to the circle, but instead is a different square. Wait, but the problem says "a figure with a radius of 11 m". Maybe the square is constructed from the triangle ABC?

Triangle ABC is a right-angled isoceles triangle with legs 11. If we consider extending the sides or building squares on the sides... For instance, according to the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse AB is 11√2. If the square is built on AB, then area is 242 as before. But again, subtracting from sector area gives negative.

Alternatively, maybe the square is built on the leg AC or BC. If the square is built on AC, then its area would be 11² = 121. But then subtracting from sector area (≈95.07) would still be negative. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about subtracting the square's area from the sector, but combining them? Or maybe the shape is the union of the sector and the square? But the predicate says Sub(AreaOf(Sector(...)), AreaOf(S)), which implies subtraction.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the predicates. Let me re-examine the given predicates:

- Arc(A,B): This suggests that there's an arc from A to B on the circle, which would be the arc corresponding to the sector CAB.
- Sector(C,A,B): The sector formed by points C, A, B, which is the same as the arc AB and the two radii AC and BC.
- Square(S): A square S exists. But how is it positioned? It's not specified, but given that the problem involves subtraction, perhaps the square is inside the sector?

Alternatively, maybe the square is the square formed by the center C and points A and B. But since AC and BC are radii, and angle at C is 90 degrees, if we connect A to B, then triangle ABC is the right triangle. If we want to build a square on top of that triangle... Not sure.

Wait, another thought: if the square is constructed such that one of its sides is the hypotenuse AB, and the other sides are extensions from A and B. But again, without knowing the configuration, it's hard to tell.

Perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me go back to the original problem statement and see if I missed something. The problem says "Find the area of the shape shown." Given that the user hasn't provided an image, but given the predicates, the most probable scenario is that the shape is the sector minus the square. Even though earlier calculations suggested negative area, perhaps I made an error.

Wait, maybe the square is not the one with side 11, but the square whose side is equal to the radius of the circle. But that would still be 11. Alternatively, maybe the square is the square formed by rotating the triangle ABC? No.

Alternatively, maybe the square is not directly related to the circle, but is a separate square whose area needs to be found. Wait, but the problem says "a figure with a radius of 11 m"—so the entire figure includes a circle with radius 11, and possibly other figures. But the question is about the area of the shape, which might be the sector minus the square. 

Let me assume that the square S is a square with side length equal to the radius of the circle, which is 11 m. Then, AreaOf(S) = 11^2 = 121 m². The area of the sector is 121π/4 m². So, the difference between these two areas would be 121π/4 - 121. But since the problem asks for the area of the shape, which is this difference, even though it results in a negative number, but since area can't be negative, perhaps I have the order reversed? Maybe it's AreaOf(S) minus AreaOf(Sector(...))? Let me check.

If the shape is the square minus the sector, then the area would be 121 - 121π/4. This would be positive since π/4 ≈ 0.785 < 1. So 121(1 - π/4) ≈ 121*(1 - 0.785) ≈ 121*0.215 ≈ 26.015 m². But the problem says "Sub(AreaOf(Sector(...)), AreaOf(S))", which means sector area minus square area. But if that yields a negative number, it's impossible. Hence, this suggests that either my interpretation is wrong, or there's a different configuration.

Wait, perhaps the square is not the one with side 11, but the square formed by the triangle ABC? But triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle, not a square. However, if you complete the square around the triangle, maybe? For instance, if you take the right-angled triangle and add three more triangles to form a square. But that would complicate.

Alternatively, perhaps the square is the square whose side is equal to the length of AB. As AB is the hypotenuse of the triangle, which is 11√2, so the area of the square would be (11√2)^2 = 242. Then, the area of the sector is 121π/4 ≈ 95.07. Subtracting gives 95.07 - 242 ≈ -146.93, which is negative. Again, not possible.

At this point, I might need to reconsider my assumptions. Perhaps the square is not directly related to the circle, but the problem refers to the square being part of the shape. Wait, maybe the shape is the combination of the sector and the square? But the problem mentions subtraction.

Wait, the problem mentions "the area of the shape shown." Since the user hasn't provided the image, but given the predicates, perhaps the shape is the segment of the circle (sector minus triangle) but here it's sector minus square. However, in standard geometry, the area of a segment is sector minus triangle. If the square is replacing the triangle, then the area would be sector minus square. But why would the square replace the triangle?

Alternatively, maybe the square is constructed on the radius. For example, if you have a square with side equal to the radius, then its area is 11² = 121. But how does that relate to the sector?

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the area of the sector minus the area of the square that is inscribed in the sector. For instance, if the square is inscribed in the sector such that two of its vertices are on the radii AC and BC, and one vertex on the arc AB. This would require calculating the area of such a square.

Let me attempt to find the area of a square inscribed in the sector. Let's model this. Suppose we have a sector with central angle 90 degrees, radius r = 11. We want to inscribe a square in this sector such that two adjacent sides of the square lie along the radii AC and BC, and one corner touches the arc AB. Let me draw this mentally.

Let’s denote the square as having side length x. One corner is at point C, and the square extends along AC and BC. The opposite corner of the square will touch the arc AB. Let me set up coordinates for clarity. Let’s place point C at the origin (0,0). Since AC and BC are perpendicular, let's align AC along the x-axis and BC along the y-axis. Point A is at (11, 0), point B is at (0, 11). The square extends from C(0,0) to (x,0) and (0,x), but wait, if it's a square, then the fourth corner would be at (x, x). But this point (x, x) lies on the arc AB of the circle. The equation of the circle centered at C(0,0) with radius 11 is x² + y² = 11². Plugging in the point (x, x): x² + x² = 11² => 2x² = 121 => x² = 121/2 => x = 11/√2. So the side length of the square is 11/√2. Therefore, the area of the square is (11/√2)^2 = 121/2 = 60.5 m².

Then, the area of the sector is 121π/4. So, the area of the shape (sector minus square) would be 121π/4 - 121/2. Let me calculate this:

Convert to common denominator: 121π/4 - 242/4 = (121π - 242)/4. This is a positive value since π ≈ 3.14, so 121*3.14 ≈ 380, 380 - 242 = 138, divided by 4 is ≈ 34.5 m². This seems plausible.

But wait, how did I arrive at this? By assuming that the square is inscribed in the sector with two sides along the radii. This fits with the given predicates, as the square S would be this inscribed square. However, the problem didn't explicitly state that the square is inscribed in the sector, but given the presence of the Arc(A,B), Sector(C,A,B), and Square(S), and the subtraction operation, this seems like a reasonable assumption.

Let me verify this approach. If the square is inscribed in the sector as described, then yes, the area would be sector minus square. And this calculation leads to a positive area. So this must be the correct interpretation.

Thus, the area of the shape is Area of Sector minus Area of Square = 121π/4 - 121/2.

To simplify this expression:

Factor out 121/4: 

121/4 (π - 2).

Because 121π/4 - 121/2 = 121π/4 - 242/4 = 121(π - 2)/4.

Alternatively, writing it as (121/4)(π - 2).

So the exact value would be 121(π - 2)/4.

But let me double-check the calculation for the square's area. Earlier, I said x = 11/√2, hence area is x² = 121/2. Yes. And the sector area is 121π/4. So the difference is 121π/4 - 121/2 = 121(π/4 - 1/2) = 121(π - 2)/4.

Yes, that's correct. So this would be the exact value.

Alternatively, if I convert this to a single fraction:

Multiply numerator and denominator appropriately. But 121(π - 2)/4 is already simplified.

Hence, the final answer should be this expression.

Let me check if there's any other possible interpretations. For example, if the square was meant to refer to the square with side length equal to the radius, then the area would be 121, leading to 121π/4 - 121. But that would be a negative number if π/4 < 1, which it is. So that can't be. Hence, the previous calculation where the square is inscribed in the sector must be the correct approach.

Therefore, the area of the shape is 121(π - 2)/4 m². Simplifying further, this is (121/4)(π - 2). 

Let me write this as 121/4 times (π - 2). So the exact value is 121(π - 2)/4.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup  
We are given the following geometric entities:  
- A circle `C` with radius 11 m.  
- Two radii `AC` and `BC`, each of length 11 m, forming a right angle at point `C`.  
- An arc `AB` and a sector `CAB` (formed by radii `AC` and `BC` and arc `AB`).  
- A square `S`.  
- A relationship involving the subtraction of the area of the square from the area of the sector:  
  $$
  \text{Sub}( \text{AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B))}, \text{AreaOf(S)} )
  $$  

The goal is to compute the area of the resulting shape, interpreted as the **area of the sector minus the area of the square**.

---

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis  
From the given data:  
- Triangle `ABC` is a right-angled isosceles triangle with legs `AC` and `BC` of length 11 m.  
- Central angle of the sector `CAB` is 90°, making it a **quarter-circle**.  
- The square `S` is inscribed in the sector such that:  
  - Two of its sides lie along the radii `AC` and `BC`.  
  - Its upper-right corner lies on the arc `AB`.  
- The area of the square is computed based on this configuration.  

---

### Step 3: Solution Strategy  
We'll compute:  
$$
\text{Area of Shape} = \text{Area of Sector} - \text{Area of Square}
$$  
Using the formula for the area of a sector:  
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi r^2
$$  
For a 90° angle:  
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{sector}} = \frac{90}{360} \cdot \pi \cdot 11^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \pi \cdot 121 = \frac{121\pi}{4}
$$  

Next, compute the area of the inscribed square:  
Place point `C` at the origin `(0, 0)`, `A` at `(11, 0)`, and `B` at `(0, 11)`. The square lies with one corner at `C`, and its sides aligned with the axes. Let the square have side length `x`. The top-right corner of the square lies on the arc `AB`, satisfying the circle equation:  
$$
x^2 + x^2 = 11^2 \Rightarrow 2x^2 = 121 \Rightarrow x^2 = \frac{121}{2}
$$  
Thus, the area of the square is:  
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{square}} = x^2 = \frac{121}{2}
$$  

---

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation  
Now compute the area of the shape:  
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{shape}} = \text{Area}_{\text{sector}} - \text{Area}_{\text{square}} = \frac{121\pi}{4} - \frac{121}{2}
$$  
Factor out 121:  
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{shape}} = 121 \left( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{121}{4} (\pi - 2)
$$  

---

### Step 5: Final Answer  
$$
\boxed{\frac{121}{4}(\pi - 2)}
$$

Final Answer: $\boxed{\dfrac{121}{4}(\pi - 2)}$
