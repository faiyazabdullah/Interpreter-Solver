QUESTION:
The Cosine function is graphed. It passes through (0,1), (90,0), (180,-1), (270,0), and (360,1). It is symmetric about the y-axis. A black vertex labeled on the function at (0,1). Consider the graph of $y=\cos x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(0^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=\cos \left(x+45^{\circ}\right)$

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the first maximum point of the function y = cos(x + 45°) for x ≥ 0. We know that the standard cosine function y = cos(x) has its first maximum at (0°, 1). Now, we need to consider how the transformation affects this maximum point.

First, I remember that transformations of trigonometric functions involve shifts, reflections, stretches, or compressions. In this case, the function is y = cos(x + 45°). This looks like a horizontal shift. The general form for a horizontal shift is y = cos(Bx - C), where the phase shift is C/B. But here, it's written as cos(x + 45°), which can be rewritten as cos(x - (-45°)). So comparing to the standard form, B is 1, and C is -45°, so the phase shift would be -45° / 1 = -45°. Wait, but phase shift direction can be confusing. Let me recall: if you have cos(B(x - D)), then the shift is D units to the right. If there's a negative sign inside, like cos(B(x - D)) becomes cos(Bx - BD), so if the original is cos(x + 45°), that's equivalent to cos(x - (-45°)), so D is -45°, meaning the shift is to the left by 45°. 

So the graph of y = cos(x + 45°) is the graph of y = cos(x) shifted 45° to the left. That means every point on the original cosine curve moves 45° to the left. Therefore, the maximum point that was originally at (0°, 1) would now be at (-45°, 1). However, since we're looking for the first maximum point for x ≥ 0, we need to find the next maximum after shifting. Wait, but if we shift left by 45°, the maximum that was at 0° is now at -45°, which is not in the domain x ≥ 0. So the next maximum would be the one that was originally at 360°, which is also a maximum. Wait, no—the original cosine function has maxima at 0°, 360°, 720°, etc., because cosine repeats every 360°. So if we shift left by 45°, then the new maxima would be at 0° - 45° = -45°, 360° - 45° = 315°, 720° - 45° = 675°, etc. 

Therefore, the first maximum for x ≥ 0 would be at 315°, since -45° is negative and not allowed. So the first maximum point occurs at x = 315°, y = 1. Let me verify that. 

Alternatively, maybe another way to think about it is: the maximum of cos(x + 45°) occurs when x + 45° = 0° + 360°k, where k is integer. Solving for x gives x = -45° + 360°k. To find the smallest non-negative x, set k=1: x = -45° + 360° = 315°. Yes, that seems correct. So the first maximum point is at (315°, 1). 

Wait, but let me check with the given points. The original function y = cos(x) has maxima at multiples of 360°, but the first maximum at x ≥ 0 is 0°, then next is 360°, etc. When we shift left by 45°, the first maximum would be at x = -45°, which is not in our domain. Then the next maximum would be when x + 45° = 360°, so x = 360° - 45° = 315°, which is positive. Therefore, the first maximum point for x ≥ 0 is indeed (315°, 1).

Another way: The standard maximum of cos(x) is at x=0. After shifting left by 45°, the maximum occurs where x + 45° = 0 → x=-45°, but since we want x≥0, the next occurrence is when x + 45° = 360°, leading to x=315°. Thus, the coordinates are (315°, 1). 

I should confirm if there are any other transformations. The problem mentions that the original cosine graph is symmetric about the y-axis, but that's just part of the given info. The transformation here is only a horizontal shift. So the conclusion is that the first maximum point is at (315°, 1).
