QUESTION:
Consider the following hemisphere with a radius of 8. Find the total surface area.

Round your answer to three decimal places.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the total surface area of a hemisphere with a radius of 8. Let me start by recalling what a hemisphere is. A hemisphere is half of a sphere, right? So if I imagine cutting a sphere exactly in half, you get two hemispheres. Now, the total surface area would include both the curved part and the flat circular base, I think.

Wait, but sometimes people might confuse total surface area with just the curved part. But let me make sure. In geometry, the total surface area of a hemisphere should account for all surfaces. Since it's half of a sphere, the curved surface area would be half of the sphere's surface area. And then there's the flat circular face where it was cut. So yes, adding those two together gives the total surface area.

Let me check the formula for the surface area of a sphere first. The surface area of a full sphere is 4πr². Therefore, the curved surface area of a hemisphere would be half of that, so 2πr². Then, the flat circular base has an area of πr². So adding them together, the total surface area would be 2πr² + πr² = 3πr². Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me confirm this because sometimes different sources might have different conventions, like whether they include the base or not.

But according to standard definitions, the total surface area of a hemisphere includes both the curved surface and the base. If it were just the curved part, it would be called the lateral surface area or something similar. So yeah, total surface area is 3πr². 

Given that the radius r is 8, substituting that into the formula: 3π*(8)². Let me compute that. First, square the radius: 8 squared is 64. Multiply by 3: 64*3 is 192. Then multiply by π. So the total surface area is 192π. But wait, the question says to round to three decimal places. Hmm, so I need to calculate the numerical value of 192π.

Calculating 192 multiplied by π. Let me recall that π is approximately 3.1415926535... So multiplying 192 by π. Let me do that calculation. Let's see, 200π is about 628.3185..., but since it's 192π, subtract 8π from that. 8π is about 25.1327. So 628.3185 minus 25.1327 equals approximately 603.1858. Wait, but maybe I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, compute 192 × 3.1415926535. Let me break it down. 200 × π = 628.3185307, subtract 8 × π ≈ 25.13274123. So 628.3185307 - 25.13274123 = 603.1857895. Rounded to three decimal places, that would be 603.186. 

But wait, let me verify using another method. Alternatively, use calculator-like multiplication. Let me write out 192 × π:

First, note that π ≈ 3.14159265. So:

Multiply 192 × 3.14159265.

Breakdown:

Compute 192 × 3 = 576.

Then 192 × 0.14159265.

Calculate 192 × 0.1 = 19.2

192 × 0.04 = 7.68

192 × 0.00159265 ≈ ?

Well, 192 × 0.001 = 0.192, and 192 × 0.00059265 ≈ 192 × 0.0005 = 0.096, plus 192×0.00009265≈ approx 0.01777. So total of approx 0.192 + 0.096 + 0.01777 ≈ 0.30577.

So adding up the parts:

First part: 19.2 + 7.68 = 26.88

Plus 0.30577 ≈ 27.18577.

Therefore, total is 576 + 27.18577 ≈ 603.18577. Which matches the earlier approximation. So rounding to three decimal places, it's 603.186.

But let me check with a calculator for accuracy. Well, assuming that my manual calculation is correct here. However, perhaps I made a mistake in breaking down the multiplication. Alternatively, maybe I can use fractions. Wait, but since the problem requires rounding to three decimals, the precise value is 192π, which numerically is approximately 603.185789... So 603.186 when rounded to three decimal places.

But let me also consider if the formula is indeed 3πr². Another way to think: surface area of sphere is 4πr², so half of that is 2πr² for the curved part. Then the base is a circle with area πr². Adding them gives 3πr². Yes, that's correct. So with r=8, 3π(8)^2 = 3π*64 = 192π ≈ 603.185789...

Hence, the total surface area is approximately 603.186 when rounded to three decimal places.

I think that's the correct approach. Let me just ensure that there isn't a misunderstanding about whether the base is included. Some problems might ask for the surface area excluding the base, but the question specifically says "total surface area," which usually includes all surfaces. So yes, including the base. Hence, the answer is 192π ≈ 603.186.
