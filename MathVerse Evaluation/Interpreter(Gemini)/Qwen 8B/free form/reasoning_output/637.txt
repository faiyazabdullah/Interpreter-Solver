<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the length of diagonal DF in a square prism with given side lengths. Let me start by understanding the given information and visualizing the figure.

First, the problem mentions a square prism with sides 11 cm, 11 cm, and 15 cm. Wait, prisms have two congruent bases connected by rectangles. Since it's a square prism, I think that means the base is a square. But wait, the sides are given as three different lengths? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. A square prism typically has two square bases and rectangular faces. If it's a square prism, perhaps two of its dimensions are squares, but the third is different. However, the problem states "sides of length 11cm, 11cm and 15cm". That suggests that the prism has edges of these lengths. 

But looking at the predicates provided, there are points labeled A to H, and several lines connecting them. Also, there are rectangles mentioned: Rectangle(D,C,G,F) and Rectangle(A,B,F,E). Additionally, there are some line segments with specific lengths. Let me try to parse through the given predicates more carefully.

Starting with the points: Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Then lines connecting them: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,A) forming one rectangle, probably ABCD. Similarly, Line(E,F), Line(F,G), Line(G,H), Line(H,E) forming another rectangle EFGH. Then there are connections between these rectangles: Line(A,E), Line(B,F), Line(C,G), Line(D,H). Also, Line(D,F) and Line(D,H) again. 

Wait, the problem says "a square prism", so maybe these two rectangles are the top and bottom bases of the prism, connected by vertical edges. Let me imagine that. Let's say ABCD is the base rectangle, and EFGH is the top rectangle. Then, connecting each corresponding vertex: A to E, B to F, C to G, D to H. These would be the vertical edges of the prism. 

Given that, the prism has two square bases? Or not necessarily? Wait, if ABCD is a rectangle, then EFGH is also a rectangle. But since it's called a square prism, maybe the bases are squares. However, the problem mentions sides of length 11cm, 11cm, and 15cm. So, perhaps the base is a square with sides 11cm, and the height of the prism is 15cm? But how does that fit with the given line lengths?

Looking at the LengthOf predicates: LengthOf(Line(A,B),11), LengthOf(Line(B,F),11), LengthOf(Line(F,G),15). Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)),LengthOf(Line(A,B))), so DC is equal to AB, which is 11cm. Similarly, Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))). So, FG equals BC. And since FG is 15cm, BC must also be 15cm. Wait, but earlier, Line(B,F) is 11cm. So, BF is 11cm, which is one of the vertical edges. So, if ABCD is a rectangle, then AB and DC are 11cm, while AD and BC are... Wait, but BC is part of the rectangle ABCD. Wait, Line(B,C) connects B to C. In the rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are opposite sides, and BC and DA are the other pair. Wait, but if ABCD is a rectangle, then AB and DC are equal, and BC and AD are equal. 

But according to the given, LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 11cm, so AB=11cm. Then, Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)),LengthOf(Line(A,B))) implies DC=AB=11cm. Therefore, DC is 11cm. Now, Line(B,C) is part of the rectangle ABCD. So, BC is another side of the rectangle. But from the LengthOf(Line(B,F))=11cm, which is the vertical edge from B to F. So BF is 11cm. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))). Since Line(F,G) is part of the rectangle EFGH, which is connected via the vertical edges. So FG is 15cm, hence BC must be 15cm. Therefore, BC=15cm. Thus, in rectangle ABCD, AB=DC=11cm, and BC=AD=15cm. Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle with sides 11cm and 15cm. Wait, but the problem refers to it as a square prism. Maybe there's confusion here. Because a square prism usually has square bases, but in this case, the base seems to be a rectangle. Alternatively, maybe the term used is 'square prism' meaning a cuboid where two adjacent sides are squares? Not sure. But regardless, the given data shows that the base ABCD is a rectangle with sides 11cm and 15cm. 

Then, the vertical edges like BF, CG, DH, etc., are 11cm? Wait, no. Wait, Line(B,F) has length 11cm. But if ABCD is a rectangle with AB=11cm and BC=15cm, then the vertical edges from B to F, C to G, etc., should be the height of the prism. But in this case, BF is 11cm, which might mean that the height is 11cm. But then FG is 15cm, which was given as the length of Line(F,G). Wait, Line(F,G) is part of the top face EFGH. So, if EFGH is a rectangle, then FG would be equal to EH, and EF would be equal to GH. But since FG is 15cm, and from the equality Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))), which is BC=15cm. So BC is 15cm. Therefore, the vertical edges BF, CG, etc., are 11cm. 

So, the prism has two rectangular bases: ABCD and EFGH. Each base has sides of 11cm and 15cm. The vertical edges connecting them (like BF, CG, etc.) are 11cm. Wait, but then the height of the prism is 11cm. But then, why is the problem referring to it as a square prism? Maybe because two of its dimensions are equal? Like, if the base is a square, but in this case, the base is a rectangle. Alternatively, perhaps the term 'square prism' here refers to a cube, but that doesn't fit the given lengths. 

Alternatively, maybe the prism is such that two of its dimensions are squares. For example, the base could be a square with side 11cm, and the height is 15cm. But then, in that case, the vertical edges would be 15cm. However, in our case, the vertical edge BF is 11cm. So that contradicts. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine the given data.

The problem states: "A square prism has sides of length 11cm, 11cm and 15cm as shown." So, the prism has three distinct dimensions: two of them are 11cm, and one is 15cm. In standard terms, a square prism would have two square faces, so if it's a square prism, then two of its dimensions are equal. For example, if the base is a square with side length a, and the height is b. Then, the prism would have dimensions a×a×b. But here, the given sides are 11, 11, and 15. So, that fits with a square base (since two sides are equal) and a height of 15. Therefore, the prism has a square base with sides 11cm, and height 15cm. 

However, in our case, the given lines show that the base ABCD has AB=11cm and BC=15cm. Which would make ABCD a rectangle, not a square. This seems contradictory. Unless there's a misunderstanding. Wait, maybe the prism isn't aligned such that the base is a square. Let me think again. Perhaps the prism has a square cross-section along one axis, but the way the lines are drawn, the base is a rectangle. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses "square prism" to refer to a cube, but that's inconsistent with the given lengths. Alternatively, perhaps the prism has two square faces and rectangular faces. For instance, if the base is a square, and the lateral edges are of different length. But in that case, the vertical edges would be the same length. 

This seems conflicting. Let me check the given line lengths again. From the given LengthOf(Line(A,B),11), LengthOf(Line(B,F),11), LengthOf(Line(F,G),15). Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)),LengthOf(Line(A,B))) → DC=AB=11cm. Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))) → FG=BC. Since FG is 15cm, then BC is 15cm. So, BC is 15cm. Therefore, in rectangle ABCD, AB=11cm, BC=15cm. Hence, ABCD is a rectangle with sides 11 and 15. So, it's not a square. Therefore, maybe the term 'square prism' here is being used differently, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the prism is formed by moving a square along a direction, making the vertical edges 11cm. 

But regardless of the terminology, the key is to find the length of DF. Given that D is connected to F. Let me visualize the points. Let's assume that ABCD is the lower base, and EFGH is the upper base. So, A connected to E, B to F, C to G, D to H. Then, DF connects point D to point F. 

So, point D is part of the lower base, and F is part of the upper base. To find DF, which is a space diagonal. But since the prism is a cuboid (rectangular prism), the space diagonal can be found using the formula sqrt(a² + b² + c²), where a, b, c are the lengths of the edges. 

Wait, but in this case, the edges are AB=11cm, BC=15cm, and BF=11cm. Wait, BF is the vertical edge from B to F. So, the three dimensions of the prism are AB=11cm (length), BC=15cm (width), and BF=11cm (height). Wait, but that would make the space diagonal DF computed as sqrt(AB² + BC² + BF²)? No, actually, the space diagonal would depend on the specific coordinates. Let me think.

Let me assign coordinates to the points to model this. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0,0). Since AB is 11cm, and assuming AB is along the x-axis, then point B would be at (11, 0, 0). Then, BC is 15cm. Since ABCD is a rectangle, and AB is horizontal, BC would be vertical in the y-direction. Wait, but in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, if AB is along x-axis, then BC would be along y-axis. So, point C would be at (11, 15, 0). Then, point D would be at (0,15,0). 

Now, the vertical edges connect each base point to the upper base. Since BF is 11cm, point F is vertically above B. So, point F would be at (11, 0, 11). Similarly, point E would be directly above A, so E is (0,0,11). Point G is above C: (11,15,11). Point H is above D: (0,15,11). 

Now, DF connects point D (0,15,0) to point F (11,0,11). The distance between D and F is sqrt[(11-0)^2 + (0-15)^2 + (11-0)^2]. So that's sqrt(121 + 225 + 121) = sqrt(467). Calculating that, sqrt(467) ≈ 21.61 cm. 

But let me verify if this matches with the given data. Let me check if the given line lengths match. For example, Line(A,B) is AB which is 11cm. Correct. Line(B,F) is from (11,0,0) to (11,0,11): length is 11cm. Correct. Line(F,G) is from (11,0,11) to (11,15,11): length is 15cm. Correct. So yes, this setup aligns with the given lengths. 

Therefore, DF is indeed the space diagonal between D (0,15,0) and F (11,0,11). So, the calculation would be sqrt((11-0)^2 + (0-15)^2 + (11-0)^2) = sqrt(121 + 225 + 121) = sqrt(467). 

Calculating sqrt(467): Let me compute that. 21^2 is 441, 22^2 is 484. So sqrt(467) is between 21 and 22. Let me calculate 21.6^2 = 466.56. Close to 467. So, 21.6^2 = 466.56, difference is 467 - 466.56 = 0.44. So, approximate value is 21.6 + 0.44/(2*21.6) ≈ 21.6 + 0.44/43.2 ≈ 21.6 + 0.0102 ≈ 21.6102. Rounded to two decimal places, that's approximately 21.61 cm. 

But wait, the problem mentions that the prism is a square prism. Earlier, I thought that the base is a rectangle, but the term 'square prism' might imply that the base is a square. However, in the given data, the base ABCD has sides 11 and 15, which are unequal. There's a contradiction here. How do I resolve this? 

Perhaps the problem uses 'square prism' to mean that the lateral faces are squares. Wait, but in that case, the lateral edges (BF, CG, etc.) would be equal to the sides of the base. For example, if the base is a square with side length a, and the lateral edges are also length a, making all faces squares. But in our case, the lateral edges (BF) are 11cm, and the base sides are 11 and 15. So that doesn't hold. 

Alternatively, maybe the term 'square prism' here is a misnomer, and it's just a rectangular prism. Or perhaps there's an error in the problem statement. Regardless, based on the given data, the correct approach is to consider the three dimensions as 11cm, 15cm, and 11cm, leading to the space diagonal DF as sqrt(11² + 15² + 11²) = sqrt(467) ≈ 21.61 cm. 

Another way to confirm: The problem mentions that the prism has sides of length 11cm, 11cm, and 15cm. So, those are the three dimensions. Therefore, the space diagonal would be sqrt(11² + 11² + 15²). Wait, but in the coordinate system I set up earlier, the three dimensions were AB=11, BC=15, and BF=11. So, the three dimensions are 11, 15, 11. So the space diagonal is sqrt(11² + 15² + 11²) = sqrt(121 + 225 + 121) = sqrt(467) ≈ 21.61 cm. 

Thus, the answer should be sqrt(467) ≈ 21.61 cm. 

But let me check if there's another way to get DF. For instance, maybe DF is not a space diagonal but lies within a plane. Wait, in the given diagram, points D and F are connected by a line. Looking back at the lines provided: Line(D,F) is present, and it's noted that IsDiagonalOf(Line(D,F),Rectangle(D,C,G,F)). Wait, the predicate says IsDiagonalOf(Line(D,F),Rectangle(D,C,G,F)). So, the line DF is a diagonal of the rectangle DCGF. 

Wait, rectangle DCGF: points D, C, G, F. Let me see. From the given lines: Line(D,C), Line(C,G), Line(G,F), Line(D,F). So, DCGF is a rectangle. Therefore, DF is a diagonal of this rectangle. 

But if DCGF is a rectangle, then DF would be the diagonal of that rectangle. So, to find DF, we can compute the diagonal of rectangle DCGF. 

In that case, the sides of the rectangle DCGF are DC and DG. Wait, DC is 11cm (from earlier). What is DG? Wait, point D is connected to C and H. Wait, in the rectangle DCGF, the sides are DC and DG? Or DC and CF? Wait, the rectangle DCGF has sides DC, CG, GF, FD. So, DC is one side, CG is another. Since DCGF is a rectangle, DC and CG are adjacent sides. 

Earlier, we had DC=11cm, and CG is equal to BF, which is 11cm? Wait, no. Wait, from the given, Line(F,G) is 15cm. Wait, the rectangle DCGF: Line(C,G) is part of it. From the given, Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))). Since Line(F,G)=15cm, then Line(B,C)=15cm. So, BC=15cm. 

In rectangle DCGF, Line(C,G) is one side. So, CG is 15cm? Wait, Line(C,G) is part of the rectangle DCGF. Wait, Line(C,G) is from C to G. Earlier, we said that BC is 15cm. But CG is part of the rectangle DCGF. Wait, in the rectangle DCGF, the sides are DC, CG, GF, FD. So, DC is 11cm (as per earlier), CG is another side. What is CG's length? 

Since CG is part of the line from C to G. From the given, Line(C,G) is connected to Line(F,G) which is 15cm. Wait, but Line(C,G) is part of the rectangle DCGF. So, in rectangle DCGF, DC and CG are adjacent sides. Therefore, DC=11cm and CG=?. 

But how do we find CG? Well, in the prism structure, point C is connected to G. Since the vertical edges are from B to F, C to G, etc. So, CG is a vertical edge? Wait, no. If the prism is made by translating the base ABCD upwards, then each vertical edge is from a base point to the corresponding upper point. So, point C is connected to G. So, CG is a vertical edge. Therefore, CG should be equal to the height of the prism. 

But in the given data, the vertical edges are BF=11cm. Are all vertical edges equal? For example, BF, CG, DH, EA. If the prism is a right prism, then all vertical edges are equal. Therefore, CG should also be 11cm. 

But earlier, we had Line(F,G) is 15cm. Line(F,G) is part of the top face EFGH. So, FG is 15cm. In the rectangle DCGF, FG is one side, and CG is another. Wait, but in the rectangle DCGF, the sides are DC, CG, GF, FD. So, DC and GF are opposite sides, CG and FD are opposite sides. Since DC=11cm, GF is equal to DC, so GF=11cm. But earlier, we were told that Line(F,G)=15cm. Wait, that's conflicting. 

Hold on, there's a contradiction here. Let me re-examine. 

From the given, Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))). Since Line(F,G) is 15cm, then Line(B,C) is also 15cm. Therefore, BC=15cm. 

In rectangle DCGF, Line(C,G) is one of the sides. So, Line(C,G) is equal to Line(B,C)? Wait, no. Line(C,G) is a vertical edge. If the prism is a right prism, then CG should be equal to BF, which is 11cm. But according to the given, Line(F,G) is 15cm, which is a horizontal edge on the top face. 

Wait, in the top face EFGH, Line(F,G) is a horizontal edge, so FG is 15cm. Therefore, in the rectangle DCGF, which includes points D, C, G, F. So, DC is a vertical edge? Or horizontal? 

Wait, in the rectangle DCGF, the sides are DC, CG, GF, FD. Let me think about the orientation. If DCGF is a rectangle, then DC and CG are adjacent sides. So, DC is from D to C, and CG is from C to G. 

If DC is part of the lower base, then DC is horizontal. Then, CG would be vertical. So, DC is horizontal, CG is vertical. Therefore, DC=11cm, CG=11cm (as vertical edge). Then, GF is horizontal, equal to DC=11cm. But earlier, we were told that Line(F,G)=15cm. Contradiction. Therefore, something is wrong here. 

Ah! Wait, maybe the rectangle DCGF is not aligned with the vertical edges. Let me check the given data again. 

The given says: Rectangle(D,C,G,F). So, the rectangle is formed by points D, C, G, F. So, the sides are DC, CG, GF, FD. 

We know that DC is 11cm (from Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)),LengthOf(Line(A,B)))), which is 11cm. 

Also, Line(F,G) is 15cm, which is part of the rectangle DCGF. So, GF is 15cm. Therefore, in rectangle DCGF, DC and GF are opposite sides, so they should be equal. But DC is 11cm, GF is 15cm. That implies that DC ≠ GF, which would contradict the fact that they are opposite sides of a rectangle. Therefore, there must be an error in my assumptions. 

This suggests that my previous assumption about the structure of the prism is incorrect. Let me go back. 

Alternative approach: Since DCGF is a rectangle, then DC must be equal to GF, and CG equal to DF. Wait, no. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, DC = GF and CG = DF. Wait, no. DC and GF are opposite sides, so DC = GF. CG and DF are the other pair of opposite sides, so CG = DF. 

But according to the given data, GF is 15cm (since Line(F,G) is 15cm). Therefore, DC must also be 15cm. But earlier, we had DC = AB = 11cm. This contradiction indicates that there's a miscalculation. 

Let me retrace. The given data includes: 

- LengthOf(Line(A,B),11)
- LengthOf(Line(B,F),11)
- LengthOf(Line(F,G),15)
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(D,C)),LengthOf(Line(A,B))) → DC = AB = 11cm
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))) → FG = BC. Since FG is 15cm, BC = 15cm.

So, BC = 15cm. 

In the rectangle DCGF, DC = 11cm, and GF = 15cm. But in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Therefore, DC should equal GF. But here, DC=11cm and GF=15cm, which is impossible unless the rectangle is not a rectangle, which contradicts the given predicate. 

This inconsistency suggests that my interpretation of the structure is wrong. Maybe the rectangle DCGF is not a rectangle? But the predicate says it is a rectangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not aligned as I thought. Let me try to reconstruct the figure step by step using the given lines and rectangles. 

Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. Lines: 

Lower base: A-B-C-D-A (forming rectangle ABCD). Upper base: E-F-G-H-E (forming rectangle EFGH). Vertical edges: A-E, B-F, C-G, D-H. 

Additionally, Line(D,F) exists, and it is a diagonal of rectangle DCGF. So, rectangle DCGF consists of points D, C, G, F. Let me check the connections: 

- Line(D,C) is part of the lower base.
- Line(C,G) is a vertical edge from C to G.
- Line(G,F) is part of the upper base.
- Line(F,D) is the diagonal connecting F to D. 

Wait, but for DCGF to be a rectangle, the order of the points matters. Let me think of the rectangle DCGF as having sides DC, CG, GF, FD. So, DC is from D to C, CG from C to G, GF from G to F, and FD from F to D. 

So, DC is one side (length 11cm), CG is another side (unknown), GF is another side (given as 15cm), and FD is the fourth side. 

For DCGF to be a rectangle, DC must be equal to GF, and CG equal to FD. Therefore, DC = GF → 11cm = 15cm? Which is impossible. So, this suggests that there is a fundamental error in the setup. 

But the problem states that DCGF is a rectangle, so this must hold. Therefore, my earlier conclusion that DC=11cm and GF=15cm must be wrong. Where is the mistake?

Wait, the given says Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))). So, Line(F,G) equals Line(B,C). We know Line(F,G) is 15cm, therefore Line(B,C) is also 15cm. 

But Line(B,C) is part of the lower base rectangle ABCD. So, in rectangle ABCD, AB=11cm, BC=15cm. Therefore, ABCD is a rectangle with sides 11 and 15. 

Now, considering rectangle DCGF: DC is 11cm, CG is ? , GF is 15cm, FD is ?. For DCGF to be a rectangle, DC must equal GF, which would require 11=15, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. 

This suggests that either the problem has an error, or my understanding of the figure is incorrect. Let me consider alternative interpretations. 

Maybe the rectangle DCGF is not made by the points D, C, G, F in that order? Perhaps the rectangle is D, C, F, G? Let me check the lines: Line(D,C), Line(C,G), Line(G,F), Line(F,D). If the rectangle is D-C-G-F-D, then DC, CG, GF, FD. But that still requires DC=GF. 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is D, G, F, C? Let me see: Line(D,G), Line(G,F), Line(F,C), Line(C,D). But the given lines include Line(D,C), Line(C,G), Line(G,F), and Line(D,F). So, if the rectangle is DCGF, then the sides are DC, CG, GF, FD. 

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is DCFG, with sides DC, CF, FG, GD. But then, Line(C,F) would be a diagonal, which is not given. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is D, C, F, G, with diagonals DF and CG. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, the predicate says IsDiagonalOf(Line(D,F),Rectangle(D,C,G,F)). So, DF is a diagonal of the rectangle DCGF. In a rectangle, the diagonals are equal. So, DF would be equal to CG. 

But in this case, if DF is a diagonal of the rectangle DCGF, then DF can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem if we know the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. 

Let me denote the sides of rectangle DCGF as DC and CG. Then, the diagonal DF would be sqrt(DC² + CG²). 

From earlier, DC is 11cm. What is CG? 

CG is the segment from C to G. In the prism structure, point C is connected to G via a vertical edge. So, CG is a vertical edge, which should be equal to the height of the prism. 

What is the height of the prism? The vertical edges like BF, CG, DH, etc., are all equal. From the given, Line(B,F) is 11cm, so BF=11cm. Therefore, CG=11cm. 

Thus, in rectangle DCGF, DC=11cm and CG=11cm. Therefore, the diagonal DF would be sqrt(11² + 11²) = sqrt(242) ≈ 15.556 cm. 

But this conflicts with the earlier assertion that Line(F,G) is 15cm. Wait, Line(F,G) is part of the top face EFGH. So, FG is a horizontal edge on the top face. If the top face is a rectangle, then FG should be equal to EH and equal to the length of the base. 

But earlier, we had BC=15cm, and since BC is part of the lower base, which is a rectangle, then the top face should have edges equal to the corresponding base edges. So, if BC=15cm, then FG should also be 15cm. 

But if CG=11cm (the vertical edge), and FG=15cm (horizontal edge), then in the rectangle DCGF, DC=11cm, CG=11cm, GF=15cm. Wait, but GF is a side of the rectangle DCGF? No, GF is part of the top face, and in the rectangle DCGF, GF is a side. Wait, if DCGF is a rectangle, then GF should be equal to DC. But DC=11cm, and GF=15cm. This is still a contradiction. 

I'm stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's forget about the prism for a moment and focus on the given predicates. 

We have two rectangles: ABCD and EFGH. They are connected via vertical edges AE, BF, CG, DH. 

Line(D,F) is a diagonal of rectangle DCGF. So, in rectangle DCGF, DF is a diagonal. Therefore, the length of DF can be found if we know the lengths of the sides of the rectangle. 

To find the sides of rectangle DCGF, note that it has sides DC and CG. 

From the given, DC is equal to AB=11cm. CG is the vertical edge from C to G, which is equal to BF=11cm. Therefore, CG=11cm. 

Thus, the rectangle DCGF has sides DC=11cm and CG=11cm, making it a square. Therefore, the diagonal DF would be 11√2 ≈ 15.556 cm. 

But this contradicts the given Line(F,G)=15cm. How is this resolved? 

If FG is 15cm, which is a side of the top face EFGH. Since EFGH is a rectangle, FG should be equal to EH, and equal to the length of the corresponding side of the base. Since BC=15cm (from earlier), FG should be equal to BC=15cm. 

But in this scenario, FG is a side of the top face, and in the rectangle DCGF, GF is a side. Wait, if DCGF is a rectangle, then GF is a side, which should be equal to DC. But DC=11cm, and GF=15cm. This suggests that my assumption about CG is incorrect. 

Wait, perhaps CG is not a vertical edge? Let me reconsider. 

If DCGF is a rectangle, then DC and CG are adjacent sides. If DC=11cm, and CG is another side, then CG can be determined. But how? 

We know that Line(F,G)=15cm, which is part of the top face EFGH. So, FG=15cm. If DCGF is a rectangle, then GF is a side of the rectangle, so GF=DC=11cm. But this contradicts FG=15cm. 

Unless the rectangle DCGF is not aligned with the vertical edges. For example, maybe CG is not a vertical edge. Let me think. 

If DCGF is a rectangle, then the sides DC and CG must be perpendicular. DC is part of the lower base, which is a rectangle. Assuming DC is horizontal, then CG must be vertical. But then CG would be the vertical edge from C to G, which is 11cm. So, GF would be horizontal, equal to DC=11cm, but the given says FG=15cm. Conflict. 

Alternatively, if DC is vertical, then CG would be horizontal. But then DC would be a vertical side of the lower base. But in the lower base ABCD, AB is horizontal, BC is vertical. So, if DC is vertical, then the lower base would have AB=11cm (horizontal), BC=15cm (vertical), CD=11cm (vertical?), which would make it a parallelogram, not a rectangle. 

This is getting too tangled. Maybe I need to abandon trying to interpret the figure as a prism and instead focus on the given data and the required diagonal DF. 

Given that DF is a diagonal of rectangle DCGF, and we need to find its length. To do this, we need the lengths of the sides of the rectangle DCGF. 

We know DC = 11cm (from the equality with AB). What about CG? 

CG is the segment from C to G. From the given, Line(C,G) is part of the rectangle DCGF. Also, from the predicate Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))), which gives FG=BC=15cm. 

If we can express CG in terms of other quantities, we can find DF. 

Let me consider the coordinates again, but this time account for all given data. 

Assume point A is at (0,0,0). AB is 11cm, so B is at (11,0,0). BC is 15cm, so C is at (11,15,0). D is at (0,15,0). 

Now, vertical edges: BF is 11cm, so F is at (11,0,11). 

Point G is connected to F via Line(F,G)=15cm. So, from F(11,0,11), moving to G. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and F is at (11,0,11), then G should be at (11,15,11), since FG is horizontal in the top face. Thus, G is at (11,15,11). 

Now, CG is the line from C(11,15,0) to G(11,15,11). This is a vertical line of length 11cm. So, CG=11cm. 

Now, rectangle DCGF has points D(0,15,0), C(11,15,0), G(11,15,11), and F(11,0,11)? Wait, no. Wait, D is (0,15,0), C is (11,15,0), G is (11,15,11), and F is (11,0,11). Connecting these points: DC is from (0,15,0) to (11,15,0), CG is from (11,15,0) to (11,15,11), GF is from (11,15,11) to (11,0,11), and FD is from (1,0,11) to (0,15,0). Wait, but FD is from F(11,0,11) to D(0,15,0). 

Wait, but in this case, DCGF is a quadrilateral with points D(0,15,0), C(11,15,0), G(11,15,11), and F(11,0,11). Let me check if this forms a rectangle. 

Check if all angles are right angles. 

Vector DC is from D to C: (11-0, 15-15, 0-0) = (11, 0, 0). 
Vector CG is from C to G: (11-11, 15-15, 11-0) = (0, 0, 11). 
These vectors are perpendicular (dot product 11*0 + 0*0 + 0*11 = 0). So, angle at C is right. 

Vector CG is (0,0,11), vector GF is from G to F: (11-11, 0-15, 11-11) = (0, -15, 0). Dot product with CG: 0*0 + 0*(-15) + 11*0 = 0. Right angle at G. 

Vector GF is (0,-15,0), vector FD is from F to D: (0-11, 15-0, 0-11) = (-11,15,-11). Dot product with GF: 0*(-11) + (-15)*15 + 0*(-11) = -225 ≠ 0. Wait, this suggests that the angle at F is not a right angle. Therefore, DCGF is not a rectangle. 

But the predicate says it is a rectangle. This implies that my current coordinates are incorrect. 

Where is the mistake? Let me recheck. 

If DCGF is a rectangle, then the sides DC and CG must be perpendicular, and CG and GF must be perpendicular. 

From earlier, DC is (11,0,0), CG is (0,0,11), which are perpendicular. GF is from G to F: if G is (11,15,11), then F is (11,0,11), so GF vector is (0,-15,0). This is perpendicular to CG (0,0,11). So, angle at G is right. 

Now, vector FD is from F to D: D is (0,15,0), F is (11,0,11). Vector FD is (-11,15,-11). Vector GF is (0,-15,0). Are these perpendicular? Their dot product is (-11)(0) + (15)(-15) + (-11)(0) = -225 ≠ 0. So, angle at F is not right. 

This suggests that DCGF is not a rectangle, which contradicts the given predicate. 

But the predicate says IsDiagonalOf(Line(D,F),Rectangle(D,C,G,F)), so DCGF must be a rectangle. Therefore, my coordinate assignment is wrong. 

Let me try to adjust the position of point G. Since FG=15cm, and F is at (11,0,11), then G should be somewhere such that the distance from F to G is 15cm. Let me assume that in the top face EFGH, FG is horizontal. If FG is horizontal, then G would be at (11 + 15, 0, 11) = (26, 0, 11), but then CG would be from C(11,15,0) to G(26,0,11). Let's calculate CG length: sqrt((26-11)^2 + (0-15)^2 + (11-0)^2) = sqrt(225 + 225 + 121) = sqrt(571) ≈ 23.89, which complicates things. 

Alternatively, if FG is vertical? No, because in the top face EFGH, FG should be horizontal. 

Alternatively, perhaps the top face is rotated. This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should use the given data to find the length of DF directly. 

Given that DF is a diagonal of rectangle DCGF, and we know DC=11cm. If we can find CG, then DF=sqrt(DC² + CG²). 

How to find CG? CG is the length from C to G. 

From the given, Line(C,G) is part of the rectangle DCGF. Also, from the predicate Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,G)),LengthOf(Line(B,C))), which gives FG=BC=15cm. 

If we can relate CG to other known lengths. 

Let me think about the entire structure. The prism has vertical edges of length BF=11cm. So, the vertical edges are 11cm. Thus, CG is also 11cm (since it's a vertical edge). 

Thus, in rectangle DCGF, DC=11cm, CG=11cm, so DF=sqrt(11² + 11²) = 11√2 ≈ 15.556 cm. 

But this contradicts the given Line(F,G)=15cm. How? 

If FG is part of the top face, and it's 15cm, then in the top face EFGH, which is a rectangle, FG should be equal to EH and equal to the length of the corresponding side on the base. Since BC=15cm, FG should be 15cm. 

But if CG is 11cm, then in the top face, FG is 15cm, which is independent. 

Thus, even though DCGF is a rectangle with sides 11 and 11, making DF=11√2, the existence of FG=15cm is separate. 

This suggests that the earlier contradiction was due to a misinterpretation of the rectangle DCGF. It is possible that DCGF is a rectangle with sides DC=11cm and CG=11cm, and FG=15cm is a different side. 

Wait, in the rectangle DCGF, if DC=11cm and CG=11cm, then FG would be equal to DC=11cm. But the given says FG=15cm. This is still a contradiction. 

At this point, I realize that there might be an error in the problem statement or in my understanding. Given the time I've spent and the need to arrive at an answer, I'll proceed with the assumption that DF is the space diagonal of the prism, calculated as sqrt(11² + 15² + 11²) = sqrt(467) ≈ 21.61 cm, as initially calculated. 

Alternatively, if DCGF is a rectangle with sides 11 and 15, making DF=sqrt(11² + 15²) = sqrt(346) ≈ 18.6 cm. But how to justify this? 

Wait, if DCGF is a rectangle with DC=11cm and CG=15cm, then DF=sqrt(11² + 15²). How to find CG? 

If CG is the vertical edge, which is 11cm, then no. But if CG is 15cm, then it would mean that the vertical edge is 15cm. But the given Line(B,F)=11cm, so BF=11cm. This would suggest that the vertical edges are 11cm, not 15cm. 

This is very confusing. Given the time constraints, I'll go with the first approach where DF is the space diagonal of the prism with dimensions 11, 15, 11, giving y = sqrt(11

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $BF=11cm. This would suggest that the vertical edges are 11cm, not 15cm$
