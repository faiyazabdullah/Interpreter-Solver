QUESTION:
The radius of the sphere is 8.8 centimeters. Find the volume of the sphere, giving your answer correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. The problem says that the radius of the sphere is 8.8 centimeters, and we need to find the volume of the sphere, correct to two decimal places. Alright, so first, I remember that the formula for the volume of a sphere involves π and the radius cubed. Let me recall the exact formula.

Wait, yes, the volume V of a sphere is given by V = (4/3)πr³. Right? So since they've given the radius, r is 8.8 cm. So I just need to plug that into the formula and calculate it. But wait, let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem mentions some predicates like Circle(S), RadiusOf(r,S), LengthOf(r,S), and Equals(LengthOf(r,S),8.8). Hmm, maybe those are just ways to represent the given information in a formal logic system, but the actual problem is straightforward once we parse it.

So translating the given predicates: Circle(S) means S is a circle (or sphere, since we're talking about radius and volume). RadiusOf(r,S) would mean r is the radius of S. Then LengthOf(r,S) probably refers to the length of the radius, which is a line segment from the center to the circumference. And Equals(LengthOf(r,S),8.8) tells us that this length is 8.8 cm. So essentially, the radius r is 8.8 cm. 

Therefore, the problem reduces to calculating the volume of a sphere with radius 8.8 cm. So applying the formula V = (4/3)πr³. Let me compute that step by step.

First, cube the radius: 8.8³. Let me calculate that. 8.8 multiplied by itself three times. Let me do 8.8 × 8.8 first. 8 × 8 is 64, 8 × 0.8 is 6.4, 0.8 × 8 is another 6.4, and 0.8 × 0.8 is 0.64. Wait, actually, maybe it's easier to compute 8.8 squared. Alternatively, 8.8 × 8.8 = ?

Let me compute 8.8 × 8.8:

Breakdown: 8.8 × 8.8 = (8 + 0.8)(8 + 0.8) = 8² + 2×8×0.8 + 0.8² = 64 + 12.8 + 0.64 = 64 + 12.8 is 76.8, plus 0.64 gives 77.44. So 8.8 squared is 77.44. Then multiply by 8.8 again to get the cube.

So 77.44 × 8.8. Let me compute that. Breaking down:

First, 77.44 × 8 = 619.52

Then 77.44 × 0.8 = 61.952

Adding them together: 619.52 + 61.952 = 681.472. Therefore, 8.8³ = 681.472 cm³.

Now plug that into the volume formula: V = (4/3) × π × 681.472.

Compute 4 divided by 3 first. That's approximately 1.333333... So multiplying 681.472 × 1.333333...

Alternatively, compute 4 × 681.472 = 2725.888, then divide by 3. Let me check:

Yes, because (4/3)*something is same as 4*(something)/3. So 4 × 681.472 = 2725.888. Divided by 3 gives 2725.888 / 3 ≈ ?

Dividing 2725.888 by 3:

Well, 3 × 900 = 2700. So 2725.888 - 2700 = 25.888. So 25.888 / 3 ≈ 8.629333... So total is 900 + 8.629333... ≈ 908.629333...

So approximately 908.629333... cm³. Now, multiply by π. Wait, hold on! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because the formula is (4/3)πr³. So after computing r³, which is 681.472, you multiply by π and then by 4/3. Wait, earlier steps were wrong. Wait, I said 4/3 × π × r³. So my previous calculation was wrong. I did 4 × r³ divided by 3, but actually, it should be (4/3) × π × r³. Oh no, I forgot the π factor. So my mistake was not including π in the calculation. Let me redo that part.

So after getting r³ = 681.472, then Volume = (4/3) × π × 681.472. So first compute (4/3) × 681.472, then multiply by π.

Wait, so let me recalculate that. First compute (4/3) × 681.472. Which is same as 4 × 681.472 ÷ 3.

As before, 4 × 681.472 = 2725.888. Divided by 3 equals approximately 908.629333... So then multiply that by π.

So Volume ≈ 908.629333... × π. Now, π is approximately 3.1415926535...

So let me compute 908.629333 × π. Let me approximate this.

First, note that π ≈ 3.1416. So multiplying 908.629333 × 3.1416.

To compute that, perhaps break it down:

Let me write 908.629333 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

We can approximate this as follows:

First, take 900 × 3.1416 = 2827.44

Then, 8.629333 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Calculate 8 × 3.1416 = 25.1328

Then 0.629333 × 3.1416 ≈ approx 0.629333 × 3.14 ≈ 1.976. Let me compute more accurately:

0.629333 × 3.1416:

Multiply 0.6 × 3.1416 = 1.88496

0.029333 × 3.1416 ≈ 0.029333 × 3 ≈ 0.088, and 0.029333 × 0.1416 ≈ ~0.00415. Total ≈ 0.088 + 0.00415 ≈ 0.09215. So total for 0.629333 × 3.1416 ≈ 1.88496 + 0.09215 ≈ 1.9771.

Thus total for 8.629333 × π ≈ 25.1328 + 1.9771 ≈ 27.1099.

Therefore, total Volume ≈ 2827.44 + 27.1099 ≈ 2854.5499 cm³.

But let me check if that's accurate enough. However, since I approximated π as 3.1416 and also broke down the numbers, there could be some error. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach here, but since I have to do it manually, let me try another way.

Alternatively, use the exact value of π as 3.14159265...

So Volume ≈ 908.629333 × π. Let me compute this multiplication more precisely.

Let me consider that 908.629333 × π ≈ ?

Well, using a calculator method:

Take 908.629333 × 3.14159265 ≈ ?

But without a calculator, I need to estimate. Let me use the fact that π ≈ 22/7 ≈ 3.142857, which is slightly larger than π. So if I use 22/7, then Volume ≈ 908.629333 × 22/7.

But let me compute that:

First, 908.629333 ÷ 7 = ?

Well, 7 × 129 = 903. So 908.629333 - 903 = 5.629333. So 5.629333 / 7 ≈ 0.80419. Thus, 908.629333 ÷ 7 ≈ 129.80419. Then multiply by 22: 129.80419 × 22.

Compute 129.80419 × 20 = 2596.0838

Plus 129.80419 × 2 = 259.60838

Total ≈ 2596.0838 + 259.60838 ≈ 2855.69218 cm³.

But since 22/7 overestimates π, the real value would be slightly less. Let me adjust. Since π is approximately 3.1416, which is about 3.1416 vs 22/7 ≈ 3.142857. The difference is about 0.00126. So the error introduced by using 22/7 instead of π is roughly 0.00126 × 908.629 ≈ 1.145 cm³. So subtract that from 2855.69 to get approx 2855.69 - 1.145 ≈ 2854.545 cm³. Which matches our prior estimate of around 2854.55 cm³.

However, for higher accuracy, let me try another approach. Maybe use the Taylor series or another approximation?

Alternatively, accept that manual computation has limitations, but proceed with the approximate value. However, considering that the problem asks for two decimal places, we need a precise enough calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should carry out the calculation with more precise intermediate steps. Let me attempt that.

Original Volume = (4/3) × π × r³, where r = 8.8.

So let me recompute r³:

r = 8.8 cm. So r³ = 8.8 × 8.8 × 8.8.

Earlier computed 8.8 × 8.8 = 77.44. Then 77.44 × 8.8:

Let me compute 77.44 × 8.8:

Breakdown:

77.44 × 8 = 619.52

77.44 × 0.8 = 61.952

Add them together: 619.52 + 61.952 = 681.472 cm³. Correct.

So r³ = 681.472 cm³.

Then Volume = (4/3) × π × 681.472.

Compute (4/3) × 681.472 first:

As before, 4 × 681.472 = 2725.888.

Divide by 3: 2725.888 ÷ 3 = 908.629333... cm³.

Now multiply by π:

So Volume ≈ 908.629333 × π.

Using π ≈ 3.1415926535.

So let me compute 908.629333 × 3.1415926535.

Let me write this as:

= 908.629333 × 3 + 908.629333 × 0.1415926535

Compute each part:

First part: 908.629333 × 3 = 2725.888

Second part: 908.629333 × 0.1415926535.

Hmm, need to calculate this second part.

Let me approximate 0.1415926535 as approximately 0.1416 for simplicity.

So 908.629333 × 0.1416 ≈ ?

Let me compute 908.629333 × 0.1 = 90.8629333

908.629333 × 0.04 = 36.3451733

908.629333 × 0.0016 = ?

First, 908.629333 × 0.001 = 0.908629333

Multiply by 1.6: 0.908629333 × 1.6 ≈ 1.453806933

So adding up:

0.1 part: 90.8629333

0.04 part: +36.3451733 → total so far: 90.8629333 + 36.3451733 = 127.2081066

Then add the 0.0016 part: +1.453806933 → total ≈ 127.2081066 + 1.453806933 ≈ 128.6619135

So total second part ≈ 128.6619135

Therefore, overall Volume ≈ 2725.888 + 128.6619 ≈ 2854.5499 cm³.

So approximately 2854.55 cm³ when rounded to two decimal places. Wait, but let me check the precision. However, since we approximated the second part as 0.1416 instead of the exact value, there might be slight errors. Let me see how much difference that makes.

The exact multiplier is π - 3 = approximately 0.14159265... So using 0.1416 introduces an error of 0.1416 - 0.14159265 = 0.00000735. Multiply that by 908.629333 gives an error of approx 908.629333 × 0.00000735 ≈ 0.00667 cm³. So negligible for two decimal places.

Therefore, the Volume ≈ 2854.55 cm³. But let me verify with another approach.

Alternatively, use a better approximation for π. Let me take π ≈ 3.14159265.

So Volume = 908.629333 × 3.14159265.

Let me perform this multiplication more accurately.

Let me write 908.629333 × 3.14159265.

Break this down as:

First, multiply 908.629333 × 3 = 2725.888

Then, multiply 908.629333 × 0.14159265.

Let me compute this part precisely.

Let me denote x = 908.629333

and y = 0.14159265

So x × y.

Let me express y as 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.00159265.

So:

x × 0.1 = 90.8629333

x × 0.04 = 36.3451733

x × 0.00159265 ≈ ?

Compute 908.629333 × 0.00159265.

First, note that 0.00159265 is approximately 0.00159265.

So 908.629333 × 0.001 = 0.908629333

Then, 0.00059265 × 908.629333 ≈ ?

Compute 908.629333 × 0.0005 = 0.4543146665

Then, 908.629333 × 0.00009265 ≈ ?

Approximate 0.00009265 × 908.629333 ≈ 0.00009265 × 900 = 0.083385, and 0.00009265 × 8.629333 ≈ ~0.000796. So total ≈ 0.083385 + 0.000796 ≈ 0.084181.

Thus, total for 0.00059265 × 908.629333 ≈ 0.4543146665 + 0.084181 ≈ 0.5384956665.

So total for x × y is:

90.8629333 + 36.3451733 + 0.5384956665 ≈ 

First add 90.8629333 + 36.3451733 = 127.2081066

Then add 0.5384956665 → 127.2081066 + 0.5384956665 ≈ 127.7466022665.

So total Volume ≈ 2725.888 + 127.7466022665 ≈ 2853.634602 cm³.

Wait, previously I had 2854.55 cm³, but now this more precise calculation gives ≈ 2853.63 cm³? There seems inconsistency due to different breakdowns. This suggests that my manual computations are error-prone. To resolve this, maybe I should use another method.

Alternatively, use the exact value of r³ and compute the entire expression numerically with more care.

Given r = 8.8 cm, so:

V = (4/3) * π * (8.8)^3

Let me compute this step by step with decimals.

First, compute 8.8³:

As before, 8.8 * 8.8 = 77.44

Then 77.44 * 8.8:

Let me do this multiplication more carefully.

77.44 × 8.8:

Break down 8.8 into 8 + 0.8.

So:

77.44 × 8 = 619.52

77.44 × 0.8 = 61.952

Summing these: 619.52 + 61.952 = 681.472. Correct.

So r³ = 681.472 cm³.

Now compute (4/3) * π * 681.472.

Let me compute 4/3 * 681.472 first:

4/3 * 681.472 = (4 * 681.472) / 3 = 2725.888 / 3 = 908.629333... cm³.

Now multiply by π:

So Volume = 908.629333... × π.

If I use π ≈ 3.1415926535, then:

Let me use a calculator-like approach:

Let me write 908.629333 × π.

Assuming access to a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, I'll use known decimal expansions.

Alternatively, use the fact that π ≈ 3.141592653589793.

So, let's approximate:

Let me consider that 908.629333 × π ≈ 908.629333 × 3.141592653589793.

This is a standard multiplication. But without a calculator, it's hard. However, I can use linear approximation or other methods. Alternatively, refer back to known values.

For instance, knowing that π × 900 = 2827.433388...

And π × 8.629333 ≈ ?

Let me compute π × 8.629333.

Which is approximately 8.629333 × 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Again, breaking down:

8 × π = 25.132741228

0.629333 × π ≈ 1.977 (as before)

So total ≈ 25.132741228 + 1.977 ≈ 27.109741228

Therefore, total Volume ≈ 2827.433388 + 27.109741 ≈ 2854.543129 cm³.

Ah, this aligns with our initial estimation of approximately 2854.54 cm³. So rounding to two decimal places, it would be 2854.54 cm³. But let me confirm with another angle.

Alternatively, use the exact fraction.

Alternatively, recognize that sometimes calculators give more precise results. For example, if I had a calculator, entering 4/3 * π * 8.8³ would yield the precise value. But since I don't, I need to rely on approximations.

But given that various methods are leading me towards approximately 2854.54 cm³, I can proceed with that.

But let me cross-validate using another method. Suppose I use π ≈ 22/7, which is commonly used for approximations. Let me see:

Volume ≈ 908.629333 × 22/7 ≈ ?

As before, 908.629333 ÷ 7 = approx 129.80419...

Then multiply by 22: 129.80419 × 22 = ?

129.80419 × 20 = 2596.0838

129.80419 × 2 = 259.60838

Total = 2596.0838 + 259.60838 = 2855.69218 cm³.

But since π is less than 22/7, the actual value is less than this. How much less?

Difference between 22/7 and π is about 0.001264, so the error is approximately 0.001264 × 908.629333 ≈ 1.147 cm³. So subtract that from 2855.69218 to get ≈ 2855.69218 - 1.147 ≈ 2854.545 cm³. So that confirms the approximate value of 2854.55 cm³.

Therefore, rounding to two decimal places, it would be 2854.55 cm³. However, depending on the exactness of the approximation, it might round to 2854.54 or 2854.55. To ensure correctness, perhaps I need to carry more decimal places.

Alternatively, use a better approximation for π. Let me take π ≈ 3.14159265.

Let me compute 908.629333 × 3.14159265.

Let me do this multiplication step by step.

First, write 908.629333 × 3.14159265.

Let me separate this into:

= 908.629333 × 3 + 908.629333 × 0.14159265

As before, first term is 2725.888.

Second term: 908.629333 × 0.14159265.

Let me compute this as follows:

Note that 0.14159265 = 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.00159265.

As before, compute:

A = 908.629333 × 0.1 = 90.8629333

B = 908.629333 × 0.04 = 36.3451733

C = 908.629333 × 0.00159265.

Let me calculate C:

First, compute 908.629333 × 0.001 = 0.908629333

Then, 908.629333 × 0.00059265 = ?

Let me compute 908.629333 × 0.0005 = 0.4543146665

Then, 908.629333 × 0.00009265 ≈ ?

This is approximately 908.629333 × 0.00009 = 0.08177664, and 908.629333 × 0.00000265 ≈ 0.002400.

So total for 0.00009265 × 908.629333 ≈ 0.08177664 + 0.0024 ≈ 0.08417664.

Thus, total for 0.00059265 × 908.629333 ≈ 0.4543146665 + 0.08417664 ≈ 0.5384913065.

So C ≈ 0.908629333 + 0.5384913065 ≈ 1.4471206395.

Wait, no. Wait, C is 908.629333 × 0.00159265 = (908.629333 × 0.001) + (908.629333 × 0.00059265).

Which is 0.908629333 + 0.5384913065 ≈ 1.4471206395.

So total for A + B + C = 90.8629333 + 36.3451733 + 1.4471206395 ≈ 

First add A and B: 90.8629333 + 36.3451733 = 127.2081066

Then add C: 127.2081066 + 1.4471206395 ≈ 128.65522724.

Thus, the second term is approximately 128.65522724.

Therefore, total Volume ≈ 2725.888 + 128.65522724 ≈ 2854.54322724 cm³.

So approximately 2854.5432 cm³.

Rounded to two decimal places, look at the third decimal place, which is 3. Since it's less than 5, we round down. Hence, 2854.54 cm³.

Wait, but earlier estimates suggested 2854.55, but this one gives 2854.54. Why the discrepancy? Because in this last calculation, I got 2854.5432, which rounds to 2854.54. However, earlier when using π ≈ 3.14159265, the value was around 2854.543, which would round to 2854.54.

But to confirm, let me check with another approach. Suppose I use more precise decimal places for π.

Let me take π as 3.141592653589793.

So Volume = 908.629333 × π ≈ 908.629333 × 3.141592653589793.

Let me use the fact that 908.629333 × π = ?

If I have access to a calculator, this would be straightforward, but since I don't, I'll assume that the precise value is approximately 2854.543 cm³, which would round to 2854.54 when keeping two decimal places.

However, to ensure accuracy, perhaps I should check using another method. Let me consider that the exact value of r³ is 681.472, and then multiply by 4π/3.

Alternatively, use fractions. Let me try expressing everything as decimals with more precision.

But honestly, given the manual calculations, it's challenging to get beyond three decimal places. Given that, I think the best approximation is around 2854.54 cm³. But to verify, perhaps I can reference standard formulas or known values.

Wait, alternatively, let me use the exact value of r = 8.8 cm and use the formula directly with more precise computation.

Let me compute 8.8³ = 681.472 cm³, as established.

Now compute 4/3 * π * 681.472.

Let me compute 4 * π * 681.472 / 3.

First compute 4 * 681.472 = 2725.888.

Then multiply by π: 2725.888 * π.

Divide by 3: (2725.888 * π) / 3.

Now, if I can compute 2725.888 * π / 3.

Let me approximate π as 3.14159265.

So 2725.888 * 3.14159265 = ?

Let me compute this as follows:

First, note that 2725.888 × 3 = 8177.664

Then, 2725.888 × 0.14159265 = ?

Let me calculate this part:

2725.888 × 0.1 = 272.5888

2725.888 × 0.04 = 109.03552

2725.888 × 0.00159265 ≈ ?

But to ensure there are no miscalculations, let me check once more.

Alternatively, use an online calculator (pretending I can do that). If I input 4/3 * π * 8.8³, what would it be?

Let me compute 8.8³ = 681.472, then 4/3 * π * 681.472 = (4 * π * 681.472)/3.

Calculating 4 * 681.472 = 2725.888.

Then 2725.888 * π ≈ 2725.888 * 3.14159265 ≈ let's say approximately 8563.63 (from earlier calculation).

Divide by 3: 8563.63 / 3 ≈ 2854.543, which rounds to 2854.54.

Yes, that seems consistent.

Hence, the volume of the sphere is approximately 2854.54 cubic centimeters.
