QUESTION:
The graphs of logarithm function $f(x)=\ln x$ passing (1,4) and logarithm function $g(x)$ passing (1,0) are shown below. $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$.

Hence state the equation of $g(x)$.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the equation of g(x), which is a transformation of f(x) = ln(x). They mentioned that both functions pass through certain points: f(x) passes through (1,4) and g(x) passes through (1,0). Wait, but hold on, the original function f(x) is supposed to be ln(x). But normally, ln(1) is 0, right? Because e^0 = 1. So if f(x) = ln(x), then when x=1, y should be 0. However, the problem says that the graph of f(x) passes through (1,4). That seems conflicting. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here?

Wait, looking back at the given predicates. Let me check again. The user provided some Equals statements. Let me parse them:

- Equals(f(x), ln(x)): So f(x) is defined as ln(x).
- Equals(y, f(x)): So y equals f(x), meaning the graph of f(x) is y = ln(x).
- Equals(y, g(x)): Similarly, g(x) is another function whose graph is y = g(x).
- Equals(f(1), 0): Since f(x) is ln(x), f(1) = ln(1) = 0. So that checks out.
- Equals(g(x), Add(ln(x), 3)): So g(x) is ln(x) + 3. Wait, but then if we plug in x=1, g(1) would be ln(1) + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3. But the problem states that g(x) passes through (1,0). That contradicts. Hmm, so maybe there's a mistake in my understanding?

Wait, the problem statement says: "The graphs of logarithm function f(x)=ln x passing (1,4) and logarithm function g(x) passing (1,0) are shown below." Wait, but according to the given predicates, f(x) = ln(x), and f(1) = 0. But the problem says it passes through (1,4). There's a contradiction here. Unless there's a typo or misinterpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not referring to the standard natural logarithm? Or maybe there's a vertical shift involved? Let me re-examine the given predicates again.

Looking at the list of predicates:

- PointLiesOnLine(Point(1,0), Line(y=f(x))): This suggests that the point (1,0) lies on the line y = f(x). But since f(x) is ln(x), then substituting x=1 gives y=0, so yes, (1,0) is on y=ln(x). But the problem mentions that f(x) passes through (1,4). That's conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read the problem again carefully.

Original problem statement:

"The graphs of logarithm function f(x)=ln x passing (1,4) and logarithm function g(x) passing (1,0) are shown below. g(x) is a transformation of f(x). Hence state the equation of g(x)."

So, the problem says that f(x) = ln x passes through (1,4). But according to the standard ln(x), when x=1, ln(1) = 0. Therefore, unless there's a horizontal or vertical shift, this seems inconsistent. But the given predicates include Equals(f(1), 0), which aligns with the standard ln(x). So how does this reconcile with the problem statement?

Ah! Perhaps the problem has a typo, or maybe the point (1,4) is not on f(x)? Wait, no—the problem says that the graphs of f(x) and g(x) pass through those points. Wait, maybe the problem meant that f(x) passes through (1,0) and g(x) passes through (1,4)? But the problem says the opposite. Alternatively, maybe the function f(x) is not ln(x) but something else? Let me check the given predicates again.

The user wrote:

"Given Predicates:

- PointLiesOnLine(Point(1,0),Line(y=f(x)))

- Equals(f(x),ln(x))

- Equals(y,f(x))

- Equals(y,g(x))

- Equals(f(1),0)

- Equals(g(x),Add(ln(x),3))"

So from these, f(x) is ln(x), and the point (1,0) lies on the line y = f(x). Which is correct because ln(1) = 0. Then, the problem statement says that the graph of f(x) passes through (1,4). But according to the given data, f(x) passes through (1,0). There's a discrepancy here. Is this a mistake in the problem, or am I missing something?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to two different functions? Like maybe there's a typo in the problem statement. Wait, the problem says "the graphs of logarithm function f(x)=ln x passing (1,4)"—maybe they mean that the graph of f(x) passes through (1,4), implying that f(1) = 4? But according to the given predicates, f(1) = 0. So this is conflicting.

But the given predicates have Equals(f(1),0), so f(1) is 0. Therefore, the point (1,0) lies on f(x). But the problem says that f(x) passes through (1,4). This seems like a contradiction. Unless the problem has an error, but assuming that the given predicates are correct, perhaps the problem statement has a typo. Alternatively, maybe the point (1,4) is for g(x)?

Let me check the rest of the problem. It says "logarithm function g(x) passing (1,0)", so maybe that's correct. So the problem says that f(x)=ln x passes through (1,4), but according to the given predicates, f(1)=0. So this is confusing. 

Wait, maybe the problem is using a different base for the logarithm? For example, if it were log base e, then ln(x) is the same. If it was log base 10, then log(1) is 0 regardless. But even then, the problem says "logarithm function f(x)=ln x", which is the natural logarithm. So that's still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not referring to f(x) being ln(x) but instead is a transformed version? Wait, but the given predicate says Equals(f(x), ln(x)), so f(x) is explicitly ln(x). 

This inconsistency suggests that there might be an error in either the problem statement or the given predicates. However, since the user has provided these predicates as part of the problem, I need to work with them. 

Assuming that the given predicates are accurate, then f(x) = ln(x) and passes through (1,0), and g(x) is a transformation of f(x) that passes through (1,0) as well? Wait, no. The problem states that g(x) passes through (1,0), but the given predicate says Equals(g(x), Add(ln(x),3)). So g(x) = ln(x) + 3. Then, plugging in x=1, we get g(1) = ln(1)+3 = 0 + 3 = 3. But the problem says that g(x) passes through (1,0). That's a conflict. 

So there's a contradiction here. How do I resolve this? 

Perhaps the problem intended that f(x) passes through (1,0) and g(x) passes through (1,4)? Let me try that approach. Suppose that the problem statement had a mix-up in the points. Let me consider that possibility. 

If f(x) = ln(x) passes through (1,0), which matches the given predicate, and g(x) is a transformation of f(x) that passes through (1,4). Then, given that g(x) = ln(x) + c, where c is a constant. To find c such that when x=1, g(1) = 4. So:

g(1) = ln(1) + c = 0 + c = c = 4. Thus, c=4, making g(x) = ln(x) + 4. But the given predicate says that Equals(g(x), Add(ln(x),3)), which would make g(x) = ln(x) + 3, leading to g(1)=3, contradicting the requirement to pass through (1,4). 

Therefore, there's a contradiction between the given predicates and the problem statement. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement is correct, and the given predicates are incorrect? But the user has presented the problem with the given predicates. 

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The user wrote:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
...
Equals(g(x), Add(ln(x),3))"

So according to the given predicates, g(x) is ln(x) + 3. Then, the problem says that g(x) passes through (1,0). But with x=1, g(1)=3. So that's not matching. 

But the problem also mentions that f(x) passes through (1,4). But according to the given predicates, f(x)=ln(x), so f(1)=0. So that's not matching either. 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency in the problem setup. However, since the user wants us to use the given predicates, perhaps we should proceed with the given predicates despite the apparent contradictions in the problem statement. 

Wait, the problem says that the graphs of logarithmic functions f(x)=ln x passing (1,4) and g(x) passing (1,0) are shown. But according to the given predicates, f(x)=ln(x), which passes through (1,0). So maybe the problem statement has a typo, and the point (1,4) is actually for g(x)? Let me assume that. 

Suppose that the problem meant that g(x) passes through (1,4), and f(x) passes through (1,0). Given that, and knowing that g(x) is a transformation of f(x), then we can find the transformation. 

Given that g(x) = ln(x) + 3 (from the predicate), then g(1) = 0 + 3 = 3, which doesn't match (1,4). So that's still not working. 

Alternatively, maybe the transformation is not just a vertical shift. For example, maybe it's a reflection or a horizontal shift. But the given predicate says Equals(g(x), Add(ln(x),3)), so it's a vertical shift upwards by 3 units. 

But if we take that, then g(x) = ln(x) + 3. If the problem requires g(x) to pass through (1,0), then:

At x=1, g(1) = 0 + 3 = 3 ≠ 0. So that's not matching. 

Hmm. This is perplexing. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about f(x) being ln(x) but something else? Let me check the given predicates again. 

One of the predicates is Equals(f(x), ln(x)), so f(x) is indeed ln(x). Another predicate is Equals(f(1), 0), which confirms that. Also, the PointLiesOnLine(Point(1,0), Line(y=f(x))) means that (1,0) is on the graph of f(x), which is consistent. 

Then, the problem states that the graphs of f(x)=ln x passing (1,4)... but according to our knowledge, f(x)=ln x passes through (1,0). So this must be a mistake in the problem statement. But since the user has provided the problem as is, perhaps we should ignore the problem statement's mention of (1,4) for f(x) and focus on the given predicates. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the given predicates are incomplete? For instance, maybe there's more to the predicates that we're missing? 

Wait, the user listed the following predicates:

- PointLiesOnLine(Point(1,0),Line(y=f(x)))

- Equals(f(x),ln(x))

- Equals(y,f(x))

- Equals(y,g(x))

- Equals(f(1),0)

- Equals(g(x),Add(ln(x),3))

So from these, we know that g(x) = ln(x) + 3. And the problem asks to state the equation of g(x). But given that, why is there a mention of the graph passing through (1,0)? Well, if g(x) = ln(x) + 3, then the point (1,3) lies on its graph, not (1,0). However, the problem says that g(x) passes through (1,0). 

This suggests that there's an inconsistency. However, since the user has provided the predicates, including Equals(g(x), Add(ln(x),3)), we must take that as given. Therefore, the answer is g(x) = ln(x) + 3, even though it conflicts with the problem statement's mention of passing through (1,0). 

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement's mention of passing through (1,0) is for f(x), but according to the given predicates, f(x) passes through (1,0), which is correct. So perhaps the problem statement had a mix-up, and the (1,4) is for g(x)? Let me try that. 

If the problem said that g(x) passes through (1,4), then using g(x) = ln(x) + 3, we'd have g(1) = 3, which is not 4. So that's still not matching. 

Alternatively, maybe the transformation involves both a vertical shift and a horizontal shift. For example, suppose g(x) = ln(x - a) + b. But the given predicate says g(x) = ln(x) + 3, so it's just a vertical shift. 

Alternatively, could there be a reflection? For example, g(x) = -ln(x) + c. But the given predicate says g(x) = Add(ln(x),3), which is ln(x) + 3. 

I think the key here is that the given predicates override the problem statement. Despite the apparent contradiction in the problem statement, we have to rely on the given predicates. 

Thus, the answer is that g(x) = ln(x) + 3. Even though the problem mentions passing through (1,0), which would require g(1)=0, but according to the predicate, g(x) = ln(x) + 3, so g(1)=3. This suggests that there's an error in the problem statement, but since we have to follow the given predicates, the answer is g(x) = ln(x) + 3. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem statement's point (1,0) is for f(x), which it is, as per the given predicates. So the confusion arises from the problem statement mentioning (1,4) for f(x), which is wrong, but we should ignore that and go with the given predicates. 

In conclusion, based on the given predicates, the equation of g(x) is ln(x) + 3.
