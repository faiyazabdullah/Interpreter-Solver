QUESTION:
The volume of a cylinder is given by $V=\pi r^{2} h$. The radius of its circle face is 6cm. The height of it is 8cm. 

Find the volume of the cylinder shown, rounding your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the volume of a cylinder. The given information includes the radius of the circular face being 6 cm and the height being 8 cm. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is V equals π times r squared times h. Alright, so I need to plug in those values into the formula.

First, let me recall the formula correctly. Volume of a cylinder is indeed πr²h. So, the radius here is 6 cm, and the height is 8 cm. Let me make sure I have the correct numbers. The problem states that the radius is 6 cm, so r = 6. The height is 8 cm, so h = 8. 

Now, substituting these into the formula. Let's compute each part. First, square the radius. 6 squared is 36. Then multiply that by the height, which is 8. So 36 times 8. Let me calculate that. 36 multiplied by 8... Well, 30*8 is 240 and 6*8 is 48, so adding them together gives 240 + 48 = 288. Then multiply by π. So the volume should be 288π cubic centimeters. But wait, the problem says to round the answer to two decimal places. Hmm, okay, so I need to convert that into a numerical approximation. 

Since π is approximately 3.1415926535..., multiplying that by 288. Let me do that calculation. Let's see, 288 * 3.1416. Breaking it down: 288 * 3 = 864, 288 * 0.1416. Wait, maybe a better way is to compute 288 * π directly. Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach. But since I need to do this manually, let me think. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that π ≈ 3.1416, so 288 * 3.1416. Let me compute 288 * 3 = 864, 288 * 0.1416. Let's compute 0.1 * 288 = 28.8, 0.04 * 288 = 11.52, 0.0016 * 288 = 0.4608. Adding those up: 28.8 + 11.52 = 40.32, plus 0.4608 is 40.7808. Then total volume is 864 + 40.7808 = 904.7808 cm³. Rounding to two decimal places would give 904.78 cm³. Wait, but let me check if my multiplication was accurate. Maybe there's a more precise way. 

Alternatively, using a calculator method, 288 × π. If I take π as 3.14159265, then 288 × 3.14159265. Let me compute that. Let's break it down:

First, 200 × π = 628.3185307...
Then 80 × π = 251.3274123...
Then 8 × π = 25.13274123...

Adding those together: 628.3185307 + 251.3274123 = 879.645943, then add 25.13274123 gives 904.778684 cm³. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 904.78 cm³. So that seems correct.

Wait, but sometimes different approximations of π can lead to slightly different results. However, since the problem asks to round to two decimal places, 904.78 is accurate. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately 904.78 cubic centimeters.

Let me just confirm once again. The formula is correct? Yes, for a cylinder, volume is πr²h. Radius is 6, so squared is 36. Multiply by height 8: 36×8=288. Multiply by π: yes, 288π. Converting to decimal, 288×π≈904.778684..., which rounds to 904.78. Yep, that seems right. No mistakes detected here. So the final answer should be 904.78 cm³.
