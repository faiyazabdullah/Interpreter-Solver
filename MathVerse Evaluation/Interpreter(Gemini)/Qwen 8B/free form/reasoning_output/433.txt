QUESTION:
There is a blue rectangular with four vertexes (-6,5), (-6,-1), (10,5), (10,-1). The two diagonals are red and intersect with each other at (2,2). Find the coordinates of the midpoint for each diagonal.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle with vertices at (-6,5), (-6,-1), (10,5), and (10,-1). The diagonals are red and intersect at point E, which is given as (2,2). We need to find the midpoint of each diagonal.

First, I remember that in a rectangle, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other. That means they should intersect at their midpoints. Wait, but the problem says the diagonals intersect at (2,2), so that point E must be the midpoint of both diagonals. Therefore, the midpoint of each diagonal should be (2,2). But maybe I need to verify this?

Let me think again. The diagonals of a rectangle do bisect each other, so their intersection point is indeed the midpoint of both diagonals. So regardless of the rectangle's position, the midpoint of each diagonal is the same point where they cross. Since the problem states that the diagonals intersect at (2,2), then that must be the midpoint for both diagonals.

But wait, maybe the question is just confirming that? Let me check the coordinates given for the rectangle. The vertices are (-6,5), (-6,-1), (10,5), (10,-1). Let me plot these mentally. The rectangle has sides from x=-6 to x=10, so width is 10 - (-6) = 16 units. The y-coordinates go from -1 to 5, so height is 5 - (-1) = 6 units. 

Now, the diagonals would connect opposite corners. One diagonal connects (-6,5) to (10,-1), and the other connects (-6,-1) to (10,5). Let me calculate the midpoint of one of these diagonals. Take the first diagonal from (-6,5) to (10,-1). The midpoint formula is ((x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2). So x-coordinate: (-6 + 10)/2 = 4/2 = 2. Y-coordinate: (5 + (-1))/2 = 4/2 = 2. So the midpoint is (2,2). Similarly, the other diagonal from (-6,-1) to (10,5): midpoint x: (-6 +10)/2 = 2, y: (-1 +5)/2 = 4/2 = 2. Same midpoint (2,2). So that confirms it. Therefore, the midpoints of both diagonals are (2,2).

Wait, but the problem mentions "the coordinates of the midpoint for each diagonal." Since both diagonals share the same midpoint, which is given as (2,2), then the answer is simply (2,2) for both. However, perhaps there's a trick here? Maybe the problem expects us to compute it using the given points? But since the diagonals' midpoints are already determined by the rectangle's properties, and the intersection point is given as (2,2), which matches our calculation.

Therefore, the coordinates of the midpoint for each diagonal are both (2,2). Hence, the answer is (2,2) for both diagonals.
