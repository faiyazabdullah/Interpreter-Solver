QUESTION:
The side profile of a bridge is overlapped with the coordinate axes such that $(x, y)$ represents a point on the arc that is $x$ meters horizontally from one end of the bridge and $y$ meters vertically above the road. The bridge meets the road at coordinates $(0,0)$ and $(100,0)$, with the vertex at (50,50).

Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the question is about finding the average steepness of the climb over the interval [0,20] on a bridge whose profile is a parabola. The bridge meets the road at (0,0) and (100,0), with the vertex at (50,50). 

First, I need to understand the setup. The bridge's side profile is a parabola. Since it's a parabola opening downward (because the vertex is the highest point), the equation should be something like y = ax² + bx + c. But given the points, maybe there's a simpler way to write it.

The vertex is at (50,50). For a parabola in standard form, if the vertex is at (h,k), the equation is y = a(x - h)² + k. Here, h is 50 and k is 50, so substituting those gives y = a(x - 50)² + 50. Now we need to find 'a'.

We know that the parabola passes through (0,0). Let me plug in x=0, y=0 into the equation:

0 = a(0 - 50)² + 50  
0 = a*(2500) + 50  
So, 2500a = -50  
Therefore, a = -50 / 2500 = -1/50. 

Thus, the equation of the parabola is y = (-1/50)(x - 50)² + 50. Let me check another point to make sure. For example, when x=100, y should be 0:

y = (-1/50)(100 - 50)^2 + 50 = (-1/50)*(2500) + 50 = -50 + 50 = 0. Correct. Also, the vertex at x=50, y=50. Perfect.

Now, the problem asks for the average steepness over the interval [0,20]. Steepness here probably refers to the slope of the tangent line, but since they mention "average steepness," maybe it's the average rate of change? Wait, but average steepness could be interpreted as the average value of the derivative over the interval. Or maybe average slope? Hmm.

Wait, if you're climbing the arch, the steepness would relate to the slope of the bridge at each point. The average steepness might mean the average of the slopes over the interval [0,20]. Alternatively, sometimes average rate of change is calculated as (change in y)/(change in x) over the interval. But since the path is curved, the average steepness might require integrating the slope over the interval and dividing by the length of the interval. However, the term "steepness" can be ambiguous here.

But let me think again. If someone is climbing the bridge, their climb's steepness would depend on the slope of the bridge at each point. So, perhaps the question wants the average value of the derivative (slope) of the parabola over the interval from x=0 to x=20. That makes sense because average steepness could be the average slope.

Alternatively, if they consider the total vertical gain divided by horizontal distance, which would be the average rate of change. Let me check both possibilities.

First, let's compute the average value of the derivative (the slope) over the interval [0,20]. The derivative of the parabola is dy/dx. Let me compute that.

Given y = (-1/50)(x - 50)^2 + 50. Taking derivative:

dy/dx = 2*(-1/50)(x - 50) = (-2/50)(x - 50) = (-1/25)(x - 50)

So the slope at any point x is (-1/25)(x - 50). To find the average value of this slope from x=0 to x=20, we integrate the derivative from 0 to 20 and divide by (20 - 0).

Average slope = [ ∫₀²⁰ (-1/25)(x - 50) dx ] / 20

Let me compute that integral.

First, expand the integrand:

(-1/25)x + (50)/25 = (-1/25)x + 2

Wait, no. Let me re-express the original function:

Original derivative is (-1/25)(x - 50) = (-1/25)x + (50)/25 = (-1/25)x + 2. Yes.

So the integral becomes ∫₀²⁰ [ (-1/25)x + 2 ] dx

Compute antiderivative:

Integral of (-1/25)x dx is (-1/25)*(x²/2) = -x²/(50)

Integral of 2 dx is 2x

So overall antiderivative is -x²/50 + 2x evaluated from 0 to 20.

At x=20:

- (20)^2 / 50 + 2*20 = -400/50 + 40 = -8 + 40 = 32

At x=0:

-0 + 0 = 0

So the integral is 32 - 0 = 32

Then average slope is 32 / 20 = 1.6

Wait, but the problem says "average steepness of the climb over the interval [0,20]". But slope here is rise over run, so if the average slope is 1.6, then that would mean that for every meter horizontally, the climb increases by 1.6 meters vertically. But wait, the units here are meters. Let me check if that makes sense.

But let me verify with another approach. Suppose instead of average slope, they want the average rate of change, which is (Δy)/(Δx). From x=0 to x=20, the vertical change is y(20) - y(0). Let's calculate that.

Earlier, we had the equation y = (-1/50)(x - 50)^2 + 50.

At x=0: y = (-1/50)(-50)^2 + 50 = (-1/50)(2500) + 50 = -50 + 50 = 0. Which matches the given point (0,0).

At x=20: y = (-1/50)(20 - 50)^2 + 50 = (-1/50)(-30)^2 + 50 = (-1/50)(900) + 50 = -18 + 50 = 32. So Δy = 32 - 0 = 32. Δx is 20 - 0 = 20. So average rate of change is 32/20 = 1.6, same as before.

So whether we take the average value of the derivative or the average rate of change, we get the same result here. Because the average value of the derivative over [a,b] is equal to (Δy)/(Δx). Wait, yes! Because the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that the average value of f'(x) over [a,b] is equal to (f(b)-f(a))/(b-a). Therefore, both approaches give the same answer. Hence, the average steepness is 1.6.

But wait, the problem mentions that pedestrians are climbing the full arch. But the question is specifically about the interval [0,20]. So the answer is 1.6? But let me check if there's any other interpretation.

Alternatively, could "average steepness" refer to the average of the absolute values of the slope? But that seems less likely unless specified. The problem doesn't mention absolute value, so I think it's safe to assume it's just the average slope, which could be positive or negative. However, since we're talking about climbing upwards, the steepness is positive. In our case, from x=0 to x=20, the slope is positive because the parabola is increasing in that interval. Let me confirm.

The derivative dy/dx = (-1/25)(x - 50). At x=0, slope is (-1/25)(-50) = 2. At x=20, slope is (-1/25)(-30) = 1.2. So the slope decreases from 2 to 1.2 over the interval. Therefore, the average slope is 1.6, which is between 1.2 and 2. That seems correct.

But let me also think about units. The problem says "x meters horizontally from one end", so the horizontal distance is in meters, and y is meters vertically. Therefore, the slope is rise over run, so units would be meters per meter, which is dimensionless. However, the answer is 1.6, which is a number. So the answer would be 1.6, which is 8/5. But let me check if they want it as a fraction or decimal. The problem didn't specify, but in math problems, fractions are often preferred unless decimals are specified. However, the given data has numbers like 20,32 which are integers. But 1.6 is 8/5. Let me see if the calculation was correct.

Yes, the integral gave us 32 over 20, which simplifies to 8/5 or 1.6. So either is acceptable. However, since the problem uses decimal numbers (like 20,32), maybe decimal is okay. But let me check if there's any mistake in my steps.

Wait, let me recheck the integral calculation. The integral of the derivative from 0 to 20 is 32, divided by 20 gives 1.6. Correct. And that's the same as the average rate of change. So that's right.

Another thought: Maybe they want the average steepness as the average of the instantaneous steepness, which would be the average value of the derivative. But as we saw, that's the same as the average rate of change here. Therefore, the answer is 1.6. So converting that to a boxed expression, it would be \boxed{1.6}. But let me check if there's a different way.

Wait, the problem mentions "the average steepness of the climb over the interval [0,20]". If they consider steepness as the magnitude of the slope, then the average of |slope|. But that would complicate things. However, since the entire interval is where the bridge is going up, the slope is positive, so the average steepness would be the same as the average slope. Therefore, 1.6 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of percentage or something else? But no, the question says "average steepness", and in the context of a bridge, steepness is typically expressed as a ratio of rise over run, which is what we computed. So 1.6 means for every meter you move horizontally, you go up 1.6 meters vertically. That seems high, but considering the bridge goes up to 50 meters at x=50, so the slope starts at 2 (at x=0) and decreases to 1.2 at x=20. So the average being 1.6 makes sense.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is 1.6. Converting that to LaTeX, it would be \boxed{1.6}. Alternatively, if fractional form is needed, 8/5 is 1.6. Either is fine, but since the problem includes decimal numbers like 20,32, maybe decimal is better.

Wait, but let me check once more. The problem says "Find the average steepness of the climb over the interval [0,20]." If the answer is 1.6, then that's the average slope. However, in some contexts, average steepness might be interpreted differently. Let me check if there's a possibility of misunderstanding.

Suppose someone thinks that "steepness" refers to the maximum steepness, but no, the question says average. Another possible confusion: Is the interval [0,20] along the curve or along the x-axis? Well, the problem says "over the interval [0,20]" and mentions that x is horizontal distance, so it's along the x-axis. Thus, the average steepness is indeed the average slope over x from 0 to 20, which we found as 1.6. 

Hence, I'm confident the answer is 1.6.
</think>

To determine the **average steepness** of the climb over the interval $[0, 20]$, we analyze the geometry of the bridge, which is modeled as a parabola. Given the key points:

- The bridge spans from $(0, 0)$ to $(100, 0)$,
- The vertex of the parabola lies at $(50, 50)$,

we begin by deriving the equation of the parabola.

---

### Step 1: Equation of the Parabola

A general quadratic equation with vertex at $(h, k)$ is:

$$
y = a(x - h)^2 + k
$$

Substituting $h = 50$, $k = 50$, we have:

$$
y = a(x - 50)^2 + 50
$$

Using the known point $(0, 0)$, substitute into the equation:

$$
0 = a(0 - 50)^2 + 50 \Rightarrow 0 = 2500a + 50 \Rightarrow a = -\frac{1}{50}
$$

So the equation of the parabola becomes:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{50}(x - 50)^2 + 50
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine Average Steepness

**Steepness** refers to the **rate of change** — in this context, the **slope** of the parabola. We are asked to find the **average steepness** over the interval $[0, 20]$. This corresponds to the **average value of the derivative** of the function over this interval.

#### Derivative of the Parabola

Differentiate the parabola’s equation:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{1}{25}(x - 50)
$$

This represents the slope (or steepness) at any point $x$.

---

### Step 3: Compute the Average Value of the Slope

The **average value of a function** $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ is given by:

$$
\text{Avg} = \frac{1}{b - a} \int_a^b f(x)\,dx
$$

Apply this to the derivative:

$$
\text{Average slope} = \frac{1}{20} \int_0^{20} -\frac{1}{25}(x - 50)\,dx
$$

Evaluate the integral:

$$
\int_0^{20} -\frac{1}{25}(x - 50)\,dx = -\frac{1}{25} \int_0^{20} (x - 50)\,dx
$$

Break down the integration:

$$
\int_0^{20} (x - 50)\,dx = \left[\frac{x^2}{2} - 50x\right]_0^{20} = \left(\frac{400}{2} - 1000\right) - 0 = 200 - 1000 = -800
$$

Multiply by $-\frac{1}{25}$:

$$
- \frac{1}{25} \cdot (-800) = 32
$$

Divide by the interval length (20):

$$
\text{Average slope} = \frac{32}{20} = 1.6
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{1.6}
$$
