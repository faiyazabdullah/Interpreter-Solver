MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. Let me start by listing out all the given information.

We have points A, B, and C forming a triangle ABC. It's specified as a right-angled triangle. The RightAngle predicate applies to Angle(A,B,C), so that means the right angle is at point B because the angle is formed by points A-B-C. Wait, no—the notation Angle(A,B,C) typically denotes the angle at point B, with segments BA and BC. So the right angle is at vertex B. 

Next, there are some length measurements. The LengthOf(Line(A,B)) is 4 units. Then, the LengthOf(Line(A,C)) is Mul(4, SqrtOf(2)). Since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, multiplying by 4 gives about 5.656. But we'll keep it symbolic for accuracy.

Also, the MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B)) is theta. That angle is at point C, since the middle letter is C. Wait, Angle(A,C,B) would be the angle at point C, formed by points A-C-B. So theta is the measure of angle at C. 

Additionally, there's a Perpendicular relationship between Line(A,B) and Line(B,C). Since AB and BC are perpendicular, that confirms that the triangle is right-angled at B, which aligns with the RightAngle predicate. Also, IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)) indicates that AC is the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Therefore, AC is opposite the right angle, which makes sense because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle. So sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse.

Another thing mentioned is Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)), LengthOf(Line(B,C))). This tells us that AB equals BC. Both legs are equal in length. Given that AB is 4 units, then BC is also 4 units. 

Now, the problem asks us to find the measure of angle theta, which is angle at C. Since we know the lengths of the sides, maybe we can use trigonometry here. In a right-angled triangle, the tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent. Let me visualize the triangle: right angle at B, so AB and BC are the legs, each 4 units. The hypotenuse AC is 4√2. 

Wait, if AB and BC are both 4, then the hypotenuse should be √(AB² + BC²) = √(16 + 16) = √32 = 4√2. Which matches the given length of AC. So that checks out. 

So angle theta is at point C. In triangle ABC, angle at C. Let me think. In triangle ABC, with right angle at B, the other two angles are at A and C. Since AB = BC, the triangle is not just right-angled but also isoceles? Wait, AB and BC are the legs. If they are equal, then yes, the triangle is an isosceles right-angled triangle. Therefore, the two non-right angles are equal. Each of them would be 45 degrees. 

But wait, angle at C is one of those. So theta should be 45 degrees. However, let me confirm using trigonometry. 

Let me consider angle at C. The sides relative to angle C: the opposite side is AB, which is 4 units. The adjacent side is BC, which is 4 units. So tan(theta) = opposite / adjacent = AB / BC = 4 / 4 = 1. Therefore, theta = arctan(1) = 45 degrees. 

Alternatively, since the triangle is isosceles right-angled, the two acute angles are each 45 degrees. Hence theta is 45 degrees. 

Therefore, the answer should be 45 degrees. 

Let me check again. All given info aligns with this conclusion. The legs are equal, hypotenuse is 4√2, so it's a standard 45-45-90 triangle. Thus, angle at C is indeed 45 degrees. 

I don't see any conflicting information here. The perpendicularity, the lengths, everything fits. So theta is 45 degrees.
