Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the true bearing of point A from point O, given that the angle between line OA and the north direction is 31 degrees. 

First, I need to recall what a true bearing means. From what I remember, bearings are measured clockwise from the north direction. So, if something has a bearing of θ degrees, it means you start at north and turn θ degrees towards the east. But wait, sometimes bearings can also be measured from different directions, but in standard terms, it's usually clockwise from north. Let me confirm that. Yes, in navigation, true bearing is typically measured clockwise from the north. So, if the angle between OA and north is 31 degrees, that would directly relate to the bearing.

Wait, but the problem says "the angle between line OA and the north direction is 31°". So, if we imagine standing at point O, looking north, then turning towards point A, the angle between north and OA is 31 degrees. That would mean that the bearing of A from O is 31 degrees. Wait, but maybe I need to consider the direction. If the angle is measured from north towards OA, then depending on which way the angle is measured, it could be east or west. Hmm. Let me visualize this.

Let me sketch mentally. Suppose O is the origin. North is upwards. Line OA goes from O to A. The angle between OA and north is 31 degrees. So, if I'm facing north and turn towards OA, the angle between my original north direction and the line OA is 31 degrees. Depending on whether A is to the east or west of north, the bearing would be different. But since the angle is positive and not specified as east or west, perhaps we assume it's measured clockwise? Or maybe the problem defines it as such.

Wait, in standard bearings, if you have a bearing of θ degrees, it's measured clockwise from north. So, if the angle between OA and north is 31 degrees, then the bearing of A from O would be 31 degrees. However, sometimes angles in geometry problems might be measured differently. For example, in some contexts, angles are measured counterclockwise from a reference axis. But here, the problem mentions "north direction," so it's likely that the angle is measured clockwise from north. Therefore, the true bearing should be 31 degrees. But let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a confusion between the angle being measured from north towards the line OA. Let's think about coordinate systems. In mathematics, angles are often measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (east). But in navigation, bearings are measured clockwise from north. So, if we have a line OA making an angle of 31 degrees with north, then converting that to a standard mathematical angle would require adjusting.

Wait, suppose north is the positive y-axis. Then, the angle between OA and the positive y-axis is 31 degrees. If the angle is measured clockwise, then the standard mathematical angle (from positive x-axis) would be 90 degrees minus 31 degrees, which is 59 degrees. But that depends on the direction of the angle. Wait, no—if the angle is measured clockwise from north (positive y-axis), then the standard position angle (counterclockwise from positive x-axis) would be 90° - θ if θ is measured clockwise from north. Wait, let me clarify.

Imagine the standard coordinate system where east is the positive x-axis and north is the positive y-axis. If a line makes an angle θ clockwise from north, then its standard angle φ from the positive x-axis would be 90° - θ. Because starting from the positive y-axis (north), rotating clockwise by θ degrees would place the line in the first quadrant if θ is less than 90°. So, the standard angle φ would be 90° - θ. But in this case, the problem states that the angle between OA and north is 31°, so θ = 31°, hence φ = 90° - 31° = 59°. But wait, that would make the bearing θ = 31°, but the standard mathematical angle is 59°. However, the question asks for the true bearing, which is θ, not the standard angle. 

Wait, the true bearing is defined as the angle measured clockwise from north. Therefore, if the angle between OA and north is 31°, then the true bearing of A from O is 31°. But I need to ensure that there isn't a misunderstanding here. Let me re-express the problem.

The problem says: "the angle between line OA and the north direction is 31°." This phrasing suggests that if you take the line OA and compare it to the north direction, the angle between them is 31°. Since bearings are measured from north, moving clockwise, then if the line OA is 31° clockwise from north, that would mean the bearing is 31°. However, if the angle was measured counterclockwise from north, then the bearing would be 360° - 31°, but that seems unlikely unless specified. Typically, angles in such contexts are measured clockwise. 

But wait, another thought: in geometry, when they talk about angles between two lines, unless specified otherwise, it's the smallest angle between them. So, if the angle between OA and north is 31°, that would imply that the angle is measured in one direction (say, clockwise) and is the smaller angle. Hence, the bearing would be 31°. However, sometimes in navigation, bearings can be more than 90°, but since 31° is less than 90°, it's straightforward. 

Therefore, putting it all together, the true bearing of point A from O is 31°. But wait, let me verify once more. Suppose O is at the origin. North is up. If point A is located such that the line OA forms a 31° angle with north, then the bearing is indeed 31°. So, yes, the answer should be 31 degrees. 

However, I want to check if there's any chance that the angle is measured in the other direction. For instance, if the angle between OA and north is measured counterclockwise, then the bearing would be 360° - 31° = 329°, but that's not typical. Unless the problem specifies that the angle is measured in a particular direction. But since the problem doesn't mention direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), we have to assume the standard convention for bearings, which is clockwise from north. Hence, the answer is 31°. 

So, the final answer should be 31 degrees, written as 31°, which in LaTeX is $31^\circ$. Therefore, the true bearing is 31 degrees.
