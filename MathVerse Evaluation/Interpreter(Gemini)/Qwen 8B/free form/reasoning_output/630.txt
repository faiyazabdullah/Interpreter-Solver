QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of y=\sin x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(90^\circ ,1\right).

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=5\sin x

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the first maximum point of the function y = 5 sin x for x ≥ 0. Let me start by recalling what I know about the sine function. 

First, the standard sine function y = sin x has its maximum value at π/2 radians, which is 90 degrees. At that point, the sine function reaches 1. So the first maximum occurs at (90°, 1) as given in the problem. But here, the function is scaled vertically by a factor of 5. That means the amplitude of the sine wave is multiplied by 5. 

Wait, the amplitude of y = a sin x is |a|. So if the original function is y = 5 sin x, the amplitude becomes 5. Therefore, the maximum value of the function would be 5 instead of 1. However, the x-coordinate where the maximum occurs should remain the same because the vertical scaling doesn't affect the period or the phase shift. 

Let me verify this. The general form of a sine function is y = a sin(bx + c) + d. In this case, our function is y = 5 sin x, so a = 5, b = 1, c = 0, d = 0. The period of the function is 2π / |b|, which is still 2π. Since there's no horizontal shift (c = 0), the graph isn't shifted left or right. The maximum occurs at the same x-value as the original sine function but scaled vertically. 

So the maximum value of y = 5 sin x is 5, achieved at the same x-value where sin x reaches its maximum. The original maximum was at x = π/2 radians (90 degrees). Therefore, the first maximum point for y = 5 sin x should still be at x = 90 degrees, but with y-coordinate 5. 

But wait, let me check if there's any other transformation. The problem mentions that the original sine function passes through those points, like (0,0), (90,1), etc. So in the original function, when x is 90 degrees, sin(90°) = 1. So multiplying by 5 would make it 5*1 = 5. Therefore, the point (90°, 5) should be the first maximum. 

Is there a possibility that the period has changed? No, since the coefficient inside the sine is 1, so the period remains 360 degrees. Thus, the maxima occur every 360 degrees, starting at 90°, then 450°, etc. So the first maximum for x ≥ 0 is indeed at 90°, with y = 5. 

Therefore, the coordinates of the first maximum point are (90°, 5). Wait, but the question says "for x ≥ 0", so we just need the first occurrence. Since the original sine function had its first maximum at 90°, scaling vertically doesn't change that x-value. Hence, the answer should be (90°, 5). 

I think that's correct. Let me double-check. If I plug x = 90° into y = 5 sin x, then sin(90°) is 1, so y = 5*1 = 5. Yes, that gives the maximum value. And since there's no horizontal compression or stretch, the x-coordinate stays the same. 

No other transformations are mentioned, so the conclusion holds. Therefore, the first maximum point is at (90°, 5).
