Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse the given geometric predicates and figure out how they relate to the scenario described. 

The problem involves a fighter jet flying at an altitude of 2000 meters, measuring angles of depression to a target at two different times. The angles are 13° and 16°, and we need to find the distance the jet traveled in one minute. 

Looking at the given predicates, there are several points mentioned: A, B, C, Airport. Lines connecting them, angles, and some right angles. Also, there are specific length and angle measures. Let me try to visualize this.

First, the altitude is 2000 meters, so maybe point C is the airport? Wait, the line CAirport has a length of 2000, and it's stated that LengthOf(C, Airport) equals 2000. So that suggests that the vertical distance from point C (which might be the airport?) to the jet's position is 2000 meters. But wait, the jet is flying at altitude, so perhaps the jet is at point A or B? Hmm.

Wait, the problem mentions angles of depression. Angle of depression is measured from the horizontal down to the line of sight. In the diagram, if the jet is at point A, looking down to the target (maybe point C?), forming an angle of depression. Similarly for point B after moving. 

Let me look at the given predicates more carefully:

- Point(A), Point(B), Point(C), Point(Airport)
- Line(A,B), Line(B,Airport), Line(C,Airport), Line(A,Airport)
- Angle(A,Airport,C), Angle(B,Airport,C)
- Triangle(A,C,Airport), Triangle(B,C,Airport)
- RightAngle(Angle(C,Airport,B)), RightAngle(Angle(A,C,Airport))
- LengthOf(C,Airport)=2000
- MeasureOf(Angle(A,A,Airport))=13°, MeasureOf(Angle(B,B,Airport))=16°
- Perpendicular(Line(C,Airport),Line(A,C)), Perpendicular(Line(C,Airport),Line(B,C))

Hmm, this seems complicated. Let me try to sketch mentally. 

First, the Airport is a point. Points A, B, C are other points. There are lines AB, BAirport, CAirport, AAirport. So, point A is connected to B and to Airport. Point C is connected to Airport. Also, there's a line from C to Airport. 

Angles mentioned: Angle(A, Airport, C) – that would be the angle at Airport between points A and C. Similarly, Angle(B, Airport, C) is the angle at Airport between points B and C. Then, there are right angles: Angle(C, Airport, B) is a right angle, meaning that the lines CB and CAirport form a right angle? Wait, no. The angle at Airport between points C and B? Or is it the angle at point B?

Wait, the notation Angle(X,Y,Z) denotes the angle at Y between points X, Y, Z. So Angle(A, Airport, C) is the angle at Airport between A and C. Similarly, Angle(B, Airport, C) is the angle at Airport between B and C. 

Also, there are right angles: RightAngle(Angle(C, Airport, B)). That would mean the angle at Airport between points C and B is a right angle. Wait, but earlier there was another right angle: RightAngle(Angle(A,C,Airport)), which is the angle at C between A and Airport. 

So, the angle at C between A and Airport is a right angle. So, triangle A-C-Airport has a right angle at C. Similarly, the angle at Airport between C and B is a right angle. 

Moreover, there are perpendicular lines: Line(C, Airport) is perpendicular to Line(A, C) and Line(B, C). Since Line(C,Airport) is perpendicular to Line(A,C), which means that at point C, the lines AC and CAirport are perpendicular. Similarly, Line(C,Airport) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), so at point C, BC and CAirport are also perpendicular. Therefore, point C is such that lines AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport. Which would imply that lines AC and BC are parallel to each other since they're both perpendicular to the same line. 

But wait, if both AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport, then AC and BC are parallel. However, unless points A and B lie along the same line relative to C. 

Alternatively, considering that the line CAirport is perpendicular to both AC and BC, implying that AC and BC are both vertical lines if CAirport is horizontal. But maybe this setup forms a coordinate system where Airport is the origin, and CAirport is along the y-axis, while AC and BC are along the x-axis? Not sure yet.

But given that the altitude is 2000 meters, which corresponds to LengthOf(C, Airport) = 2000. So the distance from point C to Airport is 2000. If CAirport is vertical, then the altitude is 2000. 

Now, the angles of depression: when the pilot measures the angle of depression to the target (point C?), which is the airport? Wait, but the problem says the target is being approached, so maybe the target is point C? 

Wait, the problem states that the jet is approaching a target. So initially, the jet is at point A, then moves to point B after one minute. The angles of depression are measured from the jet's position to the target, which is point C (the airport)? Because the line CAirport is given. 

But the angle of depression would be the angle between the horizontal line from the jet and the line of sight to the target. So, if the jet is at point A, looking down to point C (the airport), the angle of depression would be the angle between the horizontal and the line AC. 

But according to the given, the measure of Angle(A, A, Airport) is 13°. Wait, that notation: MeasureOf(Angle(A,A,Airport))=13. Wait, Angle(A,A,Airport) would be the angle at point A between points A, A, and Airport. Wait, that doesn't make sense because you can't have two points named A. Maybe that's a typo? Wait, looking back:

Original predicates say:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,A,Airport))=13

Wait, that would be Angle(A, A, Airport), which is the angle at point A between points A, A, and Airport. But two points are the same, so that's not valid. Maybe it's a mistake in the predicate names? Alternatively, perhaps it's supposed to be Angle(A, Airport, A)? Or maybe a misprint. 

Wait, maybe it's Angle(A, Airport, something else). Let me check again. The original list includes:

MeasureOf(Angle(A,A,Airport))=13

MeasureOf(Angle(B,B,Airport))=16

This seems like a mistake. Because an angle cannot be formed with two identical points. Unless it's a typo and should be Angle(A, Airport, C) or something else. 

Wait, but given that there are other angles defined, like Angle(A, Airport, C), which is the angle at Airport between A and C. So perhaps these measures refer to different angles. 

Alternatively, maybe the first measure refers to Angle(Airport, A, A), which would be zero, but that's not helpful. This seems confusing. 

Alternatively, maybe the measure is for the angle at A between lines AAirport and something else. Wait, but the notation is ambiguous. Perhaps there's an error in the problem statement. 

But given that the problem mentions angles of depression, which are measured from the horizontal to the line of sight. So, if the jet is at point A, looking down to point C (the target), then the angle of depression would be the angle between the horizontal line from A to the horizon and the line from A to C. 

Assuming that the horizontal line from A is parallel to the ground, and since the jet is flying at altitude, the line from A to C (the airport) would form an angle with the horizontal. 

Given that, if we consider the right triangle formed by the jet's position (A), the projection onto the ground (let's call it D), and the airport (C). Wait, but in the given predicates, there's a line CAirport (assuming Airport is point C?), but the length CAirport is 2000. Wait, earlier, LengthOf(C,Airport) is 2000. So, the distance between C and Airport is 2000. So, if the jet is at point A, and looking down to point C (Airport), then the vertical distance (altitude) is the height, and the horizontal distance would be the adjacent side of the angle of depression. 

But in the given, there's a right angle at C between A and Airport. So triangle A-C-Airport is a right triangle with right angle at C. Therefore, the legs are AC and CAirport, and hypotenuse is AAirport. Wait, but the length of CAirport is 2000. 

Wait, if the jet is at point A, then the altitude is the vertical distance from A to the ground, which would be the length of CAirport, assuming that C is the point directly below the jet. But the problem states the jet is flying at 2000 meters altitude, so that would correspond to the length CAirport being 2000. 

Therefore, in the right triangle A-C-Airport, the leg CAirport is 2000 meters, and the other leg is AC. The hypotenuse would be AAirport. 

But then, the angle of depression from A to C is the angle between the horizontal line from A and the line AC. Since AC is perpendicular to CAirport (as per the right angle at C), then the angle of depression would be complementary to the angle at A in triangle A-C-Airport. 

In other words, in triangle A-C-Airport, angle at A is the angle between AAirport and AC. Since AC is vertical (assuming CAirport is horizontal), then the angle of depression would be the complement of angle at A. 

Wait, maybe I need to draw this. Let me think: 

If we have point C (airport) on the ground, and the jet is at point A, directly above point C? No, because the line CAirport is 2000 meters, so if the jet is at A, then the vertical distance from A to C is 2000 meters. Wait, but in the right triangle A-C-Airport, the right angle is at C, so sides AC and CAirport are perpendicular. Therefore, AC is the vertical leg (height), and CAirport is the horizontal leg (distance from C to Airport). Wait, but the airport is a point, so maybe the airport is at point C? Or is the airport a separate point? 

Wait, the predicates mention Point(Airport), so Airport is a distinct point. Let me clarify:

There are four points: A, B, C, and Airport. 

Lines:

- Line(A,B): connects A and B
- Line(B,Airport): connects B to Airport
- Line(C,Airport): connects C to Airport
- Line(A,Airport): connects A to Airport

Triangles:

- Triangle(A,C,Airport): connects A, C, Airport
- Triangle(B,C,Airport): connects B, C, Airport

Angles:

- RightAngle(Angle(C,Airport,B)): so the angle at Airport between C and B is a right angle. 
- RightAngle(Angle(A,C,Airport)): angle at C between A and Airport is a right angle.

So, in triangle A-C-Airport, angle at C is right. Therefore, triangle A-C-Airport is a right triangle with right angle at C. Thus, AC and CAirport are the legs, and AAirport is the hypotenuse. Given that LengthOf(C,Airport) is 2000, so CAirport = 2000 meters. 

Similarly, in triangle B-C-Airport, angle at C is right (since RightAngle(Angle(A,C,Airport))? Wait no, the RightAngle(Angle(A,C,Airport)) refers to the angle at C between A and Airport, which is the same as angle at C in triangle A-C-Airport. So, triangle A-C-Airport and triangle B-C-Airport both have right angles at C. 

Additionally, the lines CAirport are perpendicular to both AC and BC. So, lines AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport, implying that AC and BC are parallel. 

But since both AC and BC are perpendicular to the same line (CAirport), they must be parallel to each other. Therefore, points A and B lie along lines that are both perpendicular to CAirport, meaning that A and B are aligned vertically with respect to CAirport. Wait, but if CAirport is a horizontal line (if we imagine the airport at point C, and CAirport extending horizontally), then AC and BC would be vertical. 

However, the problem states that the jet is flying at an altitude of 2000 m, so if the jet is at point A, then the vertical distance from A to the ground (point C) is 2000 m. Therefore, the length of AC is the vertical leg of the right triangle, and CAirport is the horizontal leg (distance from C to Airport). 

But then, the angle of depression from the jet at A to the target (which is point C?) would be the angle between the horizontal line from A (which is parallel to CAirport) and the line of sight to C. Since AC is vertical, the angle of depression would be 90 degrees minus the angle at A in triangle A-C-Airport. Wait, no. Let me think again.

In triangle A-C-Airport, right-angled at C. The angle at A is opposite to the side CAirport. So tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent = CAirport / AC. But we don't know AC. However, the angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal (from A) and the line of sight to C. Since the horizontal direction from A is the same as the direction of CAirport (since CAirport is horizontal, as it's the base of the triangle). 

Wait, the horizontal line from A would be parallel to the ground. Since the jet is at A, and the ground is at point C, then the horizontal line from A would be the same direction as CAirport. Therefore, the angle of depression from A to C is the angle between the horizontal (direction of CAirport) and the line AC. But since AC is vertical (because triangle A-C-Airport is right-angled at C), then the angle between the horizontal and AC is 90 degrees. That can't be correct. 

Wait, there must be confusion here. Let me re-express.

If the jet is at point A, and the target is at point C (on the ground), then the line of sight from A to C is AC. The angle of depression is measured from the horizontal line at A down to the line AC. Since AC goes straight down from A to C, the angle of depression would be 90 degrees, which contradicts the given angle of 13 degrees. So my assumption that the target is at point C must be wrong. 

Alternative possibility: The target is at point Airport? Because the problem mentions "approaching a target," and the angles of depression are to the target. So maybe the target is at point Airport? 

If that's the case, then the angle of depression from A to Airport would be the angle between the horizontal line from A and the line AAirport. 

But in that case, triangle A-C-Airport is a right triangle with right angle at C. So, if the jet is at A, then the horizontal line from A would be parallel to CAirport. The line AAirport would be the hypotenuse of the triangle. 

Let me think: Suppose point C is somewhere on the ground, and the jet is at point A, which is vertically above point C (so AC is vertical, length 2000 m). Then, the horizontal line from A would be parallel to CAirport. If the target is at point Airport, then the line of sight from A to Airport would be the line AAirport. The angle of depression would be the angle between the horizontal (parallel to CAirport) and the line AAirport. 

But how does that relate to the given angle measures? 

Alternatively, maybe the target is at point Airport, and the jet is flying towards it. So, initially, at time t1, the jet is at point A, and measures the angle of depression to the target (Airport) as 13°, and after moving to point B, measures it as 16°. 

Then, the angle of depression from A to Airport would be the angle between the horizontal and the line AAirport. 

In triangle A-C-Airport, right-angled at C. So, AC is vertical (length 2000), CAirport is horizontal (distance from C to Airport), and AAirport is the hypotenuse. 

Let me denote:

Let’s assume point C is the foot of the perpendicular from A to the ground. So AC is vertical, length 2000. The horizontal distance from C to Airport is CAirport = 2000 meters? Wait, no. The given LengthOf(C,Airport) is 2000. So the distance between C and Airport is 2000 meters. 

Therefore, if the jet is at A, then the horizontal distance from A to Airport would be the hypotenuse of the triangle A-C-Airport. Wait, no. The horizontal distance from A to Airport would be the horizontal component from A's position to Airport. Since AC is vertical, and CAirport is horizontal, then the horizontal distance from A to Airport is the sum of AC_horizontal and CAirport? No, not necessarily. 

Actually, the horizontal distance from A to Airport would depend on the position of C. If C is between A and Airport, then the horizontal distance from A to Airport would be AC_horizontal + CAirport. But without knowing where C is located relative to Airport, it's hard to tell. 

Alternatively, maybe point C is the projection of the jet's position onto the ground. Wait, but the problem says the jet is flying at altitude, so its position is directly above the ground, and the target is on the ground. So, if the jet is at A, then the target is at point C? But then, the angle of depression would be from A to C, which is vertical, leading to 90 degrees, which conflicts with the given 13 degrees. 

This suggests that my initial assumption about the target location is incorrect. Maybe the target is at point Airport? Let me try that. 

Suppose the target is at point Airport. So, when the jet is at point A, it looks down to the target (Airport), making an angle of depression of 13°. Similarly, after moving to point B, the angle of depression is 16°. 

Then, the angle of depression from A to Airport is the angle between the horizontal line from A and the line AAirport. In this case, we can model this as a right triangle where the vertical leg is the altitude (AC = 2000 meters), and the horizontal leg is the distance from A's projection to Airport. 

Wait, but in this case, the line AAirport would be the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the altitude (AC), the horizontal distance from A's projection to Airport, and the line AAirport. 

But in the given predicates, there is a right angle at C between A and Airport. So, triangle A-C-Airport is a right triangle with right angle at C. Hence, AC and CAirport are perpendicular. 

Therefore, if the target is at Airport, then the horizontal distance from A to Airport would be the length of CAirport (which is 2000 meters), and the vertical distance is AC (also 2000 meters)? Wait, no. Wait, if triangle A-C-Airport is right-angled at C, then AC and CAirport are the legs, and AAirport is the hypotenuse. 

So, if the jet is at A, and the target is at Airport, then the horizontal distance from A to Airport is CAirport, and the vertical distance is AC. But the vertical distance is the altitude, which is given as 2000 meters. So AC = 2000 meters. 

Thus, the angle of depression from A to Airport would be the angle between the horizontal (line CAirport) and the line AAirport. In triangle A-C-Airport, this angle at A would be the angle between AAirport and AC. Wait, but the angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight. Since the horizontal is CAirport, and the line of sight is AAirport, then the angle of depression is the angle at A between AAirport and the horizontal (CAirport). 

Wait, but in the right triangle A-C-Airport, the angle at A is between AAirport and AC. Since AC is vertical, and CAirport is horizontal, then the angle at A is between the hypotenuse AAirport and the vertical leg AC. The angle of depression would be the angle between the horizontal (CAirport) and the line of sight (AAirport), which is complementary to the angle at A. 

Because, if we consider the right triangle, the angle at A plus the angle at Airport equals 90 degrees. The angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal (CAirport) and AAirport, which is the same as the angle at Airport in triangle A-C-Airport. 

Wait, let me clarify. Let's denote:

In triangle A-C-Airport, right-angled at C. The angle at A is θ, which is the angle between AC (vertical) and AAirport (hypotenuse). The angle at Airport is φ, which is the angle between CAirport (horizontal) and AAirport (hypotenuse). These two angles θ and φ add up to 90 degrees. 

The angle of depression from the jet at A to the target (Airport) would be φ, since it's the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight. 

Given that, the measure of φ is the angle of depression, which is given as 13 degrees at the first instance and 16 degrees at the second. 

So, for the first instance, at point A, the angle of depression is 13°, so φ₁ = 13°. 

For the second instance, at point B, the angle of depression is 16°, so φ₂ = 16°. 

We need to find the distance the jet traveled from A to B in one minute. 

To do this, we can compute the horizontal distances from A to Airport and from B to Airport, then subtract them. 

Let me formalize this. 

At point A: 

tan(φ₁) = opposite / adjacent = AC / CAirport 

Wait, but in triangle A-C-Airport, the right angle is at C. So, the sides are:

- AC: vertical leg (opposite to angle at Airport)
- CAirport: horizontal leg (adjacent to angle at Airport)
- AAirport: hypotenuse

So, for angle at Airport (φ₁), which is the angle of depression, tan(φ₁) = opposite / adjacent = AC / CAirport. 

But we know AC is the vertical distance, which is the altitude, 2000 meters. And CAirport is the horizontal distance from C to Airport. 

Wait, but in this case, the horizontal distance from A to Airport would be the horizontal distance from A's projection to Airport, which is CAirport. 

Wait, if the jet is at A, then the horizontal distance from A to Airport is the same as the horizontal distance from C to Airport, because A is vertically above C. So, CAirport is the horizontal distance from A to Airport. 

Thus, tan(φ₁) = AC / CAirport = 2000 / d₁, where d₁ is the horizontal distance from A to Airport. 

Similarly, at point B, the horizontal distance from B to Airport is d₂, so tan(φ₂) = 2000 / d₂. 

We can solve for d₁ and d₂:

d₁ = 2000 / tan(φ₁)

d₂ = 2000 / tan(φ₂)

Then, the distance the jet traveled from A to B is the difference between d₁ and d₂, since the jet flew from A to B, reducing the horizontal distance from d₁ to d₂. 

Wait, but wait: if the jet is flying toward the target (Airport), then the horizontal distance decreases. So, the distance flown is d₁ - d₂. 

Yes. 

So, substituting the given angles:

φ₁ = 13°, φ₂ = 16°

Compute d₁ = 2000 / tan(13°)

Compute d₂ = 2000 / tan(16°)

Distance flown = d₁ - d₂ = 2000*(1/tan(13°) - 1/tan(16°))

Let me calculate this numerically. 

First, compute tan(13°):

Using calculator, tan(13°) ≈ 0.230868

So, 1/tan(13°) ≈ 4.3315

Similarly, tan(16°) ≈ 0.286745

So, 1/tan(16°) ≈ 3.4903

Thus, the difference is approximately 4.3315 - 3.4903 ≈ 0.8412

Multiply by 2000: 2000 * 0.8412 ≈ 1682.4 meters

Rounded to the nearest meter, that would be 1682 meters. 

But wait, let me double-check the calculation with precise values.

Alternatively, using exact computation:

Calculate tan(13°) and tan(16°).

Using calculator:

tan(13°) ≈ tan(π*13/180) ≈ tan(0.22689 radians) ≈ 0.230868

tan(16°) ≈ tan(0.27925 radians) ≈ 0.286745

Therefore:

d₁ = 2000 / 0.230868 ≈ 2000 / 0.230868 ≈ let's compute that:

Divide 2000 by 0.230868:

≈ 2000 ÷ 0.230868 ≈ 2000 * (1 / 0.230868) ≈ 2000 * 4.3315 ≈ 8663 meters

Similarly, d₂ = 2000 / 0.286745 ≈ 2000 * 3.4903 ≈ 6980.6 meters

Difference: 8663 - 6980.6 ≈ 1682.4 meters

So, approximately 1682 meters. Rounded to the nearest meter, that's 1682 meters.

But wait, the problem mentions that the jet flies for one minute. So, this would give the distance covered in one minute as approximately 1682 meters. 

But let me verify if my assumption that the horizontal distance is CAirport is correct. Earlier, I assumed that the horizontal distance from A to Airport is CAirport, but in reality, the horizontal distance from A to Airport would be the horizontal distance from the projection of A (which is point C) to Airport. So yes, since CAirport is the horizontal distance from C to Airport, and A is directly above C, then the horizontal distance from A to Airport is indeed CAirport. 

Therefore, the calculation holds. 

But let me check if there are any errors in the interpretation of the given predicates. 

One thing I noticed was the presence of multiple points: A, B, C, Airport. And the fact that both triangles A-C-Airport and B-C-Airport are right-angled at C. Also, lines AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport, which implies that AC and BC are both vertical, hence A and B are vertically aligned over point C. Therefore, the jet moves from A to B along a vertical line, maintaining altitude, and the horizontal distance from the jet to the Airport changes as it approaches. 

Wait, but if both AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport, then points A and B are both vertically above point C. So, moving from A to B would be along the same vertical line, but that would mean the horizontal distance from the jet to Airport remains constant, which contradicts the changing angles of depression. 

Wait, this is a contradiction! Earlier assumption that AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport implies that points A and B are both vertically above point C. So, if the jet is at A, then it's directly above C, and when it moves to B, it's still directly above C. So the horizontal distance from the jet to Airport is always CAirport, which is fixed. Hence, the angle of depression wouldn't change. But in the problem, the angles change from 13° to 16°, implying that the horizontal distance is decreasing. 

This inconsistency suggests a flaw in my previous assumptions. Where did I go wrong? 

Ah! The line CAirport is not necessarily horizontal. Wait, the problem states that the jet is flying at an altitude of 2000 meters, so the vertical distance from the jet to the ground is 2000. However, the line CAirport is a segment between C and Airport, and the right angles suggest that CAirport is perpendicular to AC and BC. 

So, if both AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport, then AC and BC are parallel to each other, and both are perpendicular to CAirport. This implies that CAirport is a common perpendicular to AC and BC. So, if the jet is at A, then AC is perpendicular to CAirport, meaning that AC is vertical, and CAirport is horizontal. Similarly, BC is also perpendicular to CAirport, so BC is also vertical. Therefore, points A and B are both vertically above point C, and thus moving from A to B along the same vertical line. But then, the horizontal distance from the jet to Airport would remain the same, which contradicts the changing angles of depression. 

This indicates that my understanding of the configuration is incorrect. 

Perhaps the line CAirport is not horizontal, and the right angles are not indicating vertical/horizontal directions. Maybe the triangle is oriented differently. 

Let me reconsider the geometric configuration based on the given predicates. 

We have:

- RightAngle(Angle(C, Airport, B)): the angle at Airport between C and B is a right angle. So, in triangle C-Airport-B, the angle at Airport is 90°. 

- RightAngle(Angle(A, C, Airport)): the angle at C between A and Airport is a right angle. So, in triangle A-C-Airport, angle at C is 90°. 

Also, Perpendicular(Line(C,Airport), Line(A,C)) and Perpendicular(Line(C,Airport), Line(B,C)). 

So, line CAirport is perpendicular to both AC and BC. This means that AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport, hence AC || BC. 

So, points A and B are positioned such that both are connected to C via lines AC and BC, which are both perpendicular to CAirport. Therefore, AC and BC are parallel. 

Let me imagine this: suppose CAirport is a line segment from C to Airport. Both AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport, so they are both perpendicular to the same line, hence parallel. Therefore, points A and B are on either side of CAirport, such that AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport. 

But how does this fit with the jet flying from A to B? 

If the jet starts at point A, then moves to point B, passing through the air. The line from A to B would be along the line AB. The angles of depression are measured from the jet's current position to the target, which might be point C or Airport. 

Wait, the problem states that the jet is approaching a target. If the target is point C, then the angle of depression from A to C would be... but earlier calculations showed contradictions. 

Alternatively, the target is Airport. So, when the jet is at A, it measures the angle of depression to Airport, which is 13°, and when it moves to B, measures 16°. 

Let me try to model this. 

Let me define:

- CAirport is a line segment from C to Airport. 
- AC is perpendicular to CAirport, so AC is perpendicular to the line CAirport. 
- Similarly, BC is perpendicular to CAirport. 

Therefore, points A and B are both lying on lines perpendicular to CAirport at point C. Wait, no: if AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport, then they are both perpendicular to the same line. So, AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport, hence they are parallel. 

But if CAirport is a line, then AC and BC are both perpendicular to it, meaning they are both in the same plane and parallel. So, points A and B could be on opposite sides of CAirport, or on the same side. 

However, the jet is flying from A to B, so likely moving along a path that brings it closer to the target (Airport). 

Let me consider coordinates to better visualize. 

Let me place point C at the origin (0, 0). Let me take CAirport as the x-axis, so Airport is at some point along the x-axis. Let's say CAirport has length 2000, so if C is at (0, 0), then Airport is at (2000, 0). 

Since AC is perpendicular to CAirport (which is the x-axis), AC is vertical. So, point A is at (0, y) for some y. Similarly, BC is perpendicular to CAirport, so BC is also vertical. Therefore, point B is at (0, z) for some z. 

Wait, but if both AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport, then both AC and BC are vertical lines. So, if C is at (0, 0), then A is at (0, y) and B is at (0, z). 

But then, the jet is flying from A to B, moving along the vertical line x=0, from (0, y) to (0, z). The target is at Airport (2000, 0). 

When the jet is at A (0, y), the angle of depression to the target (2000, 0) would be the angle between the horizontal (x-axis) and the line of sight from A to Airport. 

The line of sight from A(0, y) to Airport(2000, 0) has slope (0 - y)/(2000 - 0) = -y/2000. The angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal and this line, which is arctangent of |slope|, i.e., arctan(y/2000). 

Wait, but the angle of depression is measured from the horizontal down to the line of sight. So, if the jet is at (0, y), looking down to (2000, 0), the angle of depression θ satisfies tanθ = opposite/adjacent = y / 2000. 

Wait, but the vertical distance is y, and the horizontal distance is 2000. So, tanθ = y / 2000 => y = 2000 tanθ. 

But the altitude of the jet is the vertical distance from the jet to the ground, which in this case would be y. But the problem states the altitude is 2000 meters. So, y = 2000. 

Wait, this suggests that the vertical distance from A to the ground (which is the x-axis) is y = 2000 meters. So, point A is at (0, 2000). 

Then, the horizontal distance from A to Airport is 2000 meters (since Airport is at (2000, 0)), and the angle of depression would be tan⁻¹(2000 / 2000) = tan⁻¹(1) = 45°, which contradicts the given 13°. 

Clearly, there's a misunderstanding here. 

Wait, perhaps the altitude is not the vertical distance from A to the ground, but rather the vertical distance from the jet's position to the target. But the target is at Airport, which is on the ground. So, if the jet is at A, then the vertical distance is the altitude, which is 2000 meters. 

But in this coordinate system, if the jet is at (0, 2000), then the horizontal distance to Airport is 2000 meters, giving an angle of depression of 45°, which is not matching. 

This suggests that my assumption that the horizontal distance is 2000 is incorrect. Instead, the horizontal distance depends on the position of the jet. 

Wait, but the problem states that the altitude is 2000 meters, so the vertical distance from the jet to the ground is 2000 meters. So, if the jet is at A, then the vertical distance from A to the ground (which is the x-axis in this coordinate system) is 2000 meters. 

Thus, if the jet is at A(0, 2000), the horizontal distance from A to Airport(2000, 0) is 2000 meters, giving tanθ = 2000 / 2000 = 1 → θ = 45°, which is inconsistent with the given 13°. 

This indicates a fundamental flaw in the setup. What's wrong here?

Maybe the line CAirport is not the horizontal distance from the jet to the target. Perhaps the horizontal distance is different. 

Let me revisit the given predicates. One of the predicates is LengthOf(C,Airport) = 2000. So, the distance between C and Airport is 2000 meters. 

In the coordinate system I set up, C is at (0, 0), Airport is at (2000, 0), so CAirport is 2000 meters. 

The jet is at point A, which is vertically above C, so A is at (0, y). The vertical distance from A to the ground (at C) is y, but the problem states the altitude is 2000 meters. So, y = 2000, making A at (0, 2000). 

But then, the horizontal distance from A to Airport is 2000 meters, leading to angle of depression of 45°, which doesn't match the given 13°. 

This suggests that the target is not at Airport. Maybe the target is at point C? 

If the target is at C, then when the jet is at A, the angle of depression to C is the angle between the horizontal and the line AC. Since AC is vertical, this angle would be 90°, which again doesn't match. 

This is very confusing. Let me try to reinterpret the problem using the given predicates. 

Given that there are two right triangles: A-C-Airport and B-C-Airport, both right-angled at C. And the lines AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport. 

So, if I consider CAirport as a common perpendicular to AC and BC, then AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport, hence parallel. 

Let me consider CAirport as a line segment, and AC and BC as lines perpendicular to it at point C. So, point C is the common endpoint, and AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport. 

Wait, if CAirport is a line segment from C to Airport, and both AC and BC are perpendicular to CAirport at point C, then AC and BC are both perpendicular to CAirport at C, meaning they are in the same plane and extend from C in opposite directions. 

So, if CAirport is a line segment from C to Airport, then AC is a line starting at C and going in a direction perpendicular to CAirport, and similarly for BC. 

Thus, the jet is moving from A to B, where A and B are points on lines perpendicular to CAirport at C. 

But then, the jet's movement from A to B would be along a path that is not directly towards the target, unless the target is at Airport. 

Let me try to define coordinates again. 

Let me place point C at (0, 0). Let me let CAirport be along the x-axis, so Airport is at (a, 0) for some a. The length CAirport is 2000, so if C is at (0, 0), then Airport is at (2000, 0). 

Now, since AC is perpendicular to CAirport (which is the x-axis), AC is vertical. So, point A is at (0, y). Similarly, BC is perpendicular to CAirport, so it's also vertical. So, point B is at (0, z). 

Now, the jet is moving from A(0, y) to B(0, z). The target is at Airport(2000, 0). 

When the jet is at A(0, y), the angle of depression to the target (2000, 0) is the angle between the horizontal (x-axis) and the line of sight from A to Airport. 

The line of sight from A(0, y) to Airport(2000, 0) has slope (0 - y)/(2000 - 0) = -y/2000. The angle of depression θ satisfies tanθ = y/2000. 

Similarly, when the jet is at B(0, z), the angle of depression is tanθ = z/2000. 

But the problem states that the altitude is 2000 meters. If the jet is at A, the vertical distance from A to the ground (which is at C(0,0)) is y. So, y = 2000. 

But then, tanθ = 2000/2000 = 1 → θ = 45°, which again doesn't match the given angles of 13° and 16°. 

This suggests that my assumption that the vertical distance from the jet to the ground is y is incorrect. Perhaps the altitude is not the vertical distance from the jet to the ground, but the vertical distance from the jet to the target, which is at Airport. 

Wait, but the target is on the ground, so the vertical distance from the jet to the target is the same as the altitude. 

Alternatively, maybe the target is at point C, and the altitude is the vertical distance from the jet to point C. 

If the target is at C, then when the jet is at A, the angle of depression to C is the angle between the horizontal and the line AC. Since AC is vertical, this angle is 90°, which is not matching. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to focus on the given predicates and see if there's a way to derive relations. 

We have:

- RightAngle(Angle(A,C,Airport)): so in triangle A-C-Airport, right-angled at C. 

- LengthOf(C,Airport) = 2000. 

- MeasureOf(Angle(A,A,Airport)) = 13°. Wait, this is likely a typo. It should probably be MeasureOf(Angle(A, Airport, A)) = 13°, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, it might be MeasureOf(Angle(A, Airport, C)) = 13°, which is one of the given angles. 

Wait, looking back, the user provided:

"MeasureOf(Angle(A,A,Airport))=13"

Which likely is a typo and should be MeasureOf(Angle(A, Airport, C)) = 13°, since Angle(A, Airport, C) is one of the defined angles. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(B,B,Airport))=16 is likely MeasureOf(Angle(B, Airport, C)) = 16°. 

Assuming this correction, let's proceed. 

So, the measure of Angle(A, Airport, C) is 13°, and MeasureOf(Angle(B, Airport, C)) is 16°. 

This makes sense. So, in triangle A-C-Airport, which is right-angled at C, the angle at Airport is 13°, and in triangle B-C-Airport,
