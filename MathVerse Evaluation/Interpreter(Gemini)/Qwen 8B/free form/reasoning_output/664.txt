MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the surface area of the sphere given that the radius is 11 cm. 

First, I remember that the surface area of a sphere is calculated using a specific formula. Wait, what's the formula again? I think it's something like 4πr². Let me confirm that. Yeah, right, the surface area (SA) of a sphere is 4 times π times the radius squared. So SA = 4πr². 

The problem states that the radius is 11 cm. So I need to plug that into the formula. Let me write that down. 

Given r = 11 cm. Then substituting into the formula, SA = 4 * π * (11)². Let me compute that step by step. First, calculate 11 squared. 11 times 11 is 121. Then multiply by 4. 121 times 4... let me do that. 120*4 is 480, and 1*4 is 4, so total is 484. So SA = 484π cm². But wait, the question says to round to two decimal places. Hmm, but π is approximately 3.1416. So I need to calculate 484 multiplied by π and then round it. 

Let me compute that. Let me get my calculator. 484 * π ≈ 484 * 3.1415926535. Let me do that multiplication. Well, 484 * 3 is 1452. Then 484 * 0.1415926535. Wait, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, since π ≈ 3.1416, so 484 * 3.1416. Let me break it down:

First, 484 * 3 = 1452

Then 484 * 0.1416. Let me compute 484 * 0.1 = 48.4

484 * 0.04 = 19.36

484 * 0.0016 = ?

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me just do 484 * 3.1416 directly.

Alternatively, I can note that π is approximately 3.1416, so multiplying 484 * π gives roughly:

Well, 484 * 3 = 1452, 484 * 0.1416 ≈ 484 * 0.14 = 67.76, plus 484 * 0.0016 ≈ 0.7744. Adding those together, 67.76 + 0.7744 ≈ 68.5344. Then total SA ≈ 1452 + 68.5344 = 1520.5344 cm². Rounding to two decimal places would give 1520.53 cm². 

But wait, let me check if I did that correctly. Because 484 * π is more accurately computed using a calculator. Let me verify. If I take π ≈ 3.14159265, then 484 * π ≈ 484 * 3.14159265. Let me compute this precisely. 

Using a calculator, 484 × π equals approximately 1520.530844... So rounding to two decimal places, it's 1520.53 cm². Therefore, the surface area is approximately 1520.53 square centimeters. 

Wait, but sometimes problems might expect the answer in terms of π, but the question says to round to two decimal places, so they probably want the numerical value. So the final answer should be 1520.53 cm². 

Let me double-check the formula once more. Yes, surface area of a sphere is indeed 4πr². Radius is 11 cm, so squared is 121, times 4 is 484. Multiply by π gives about 1520.53. Yep, that seems correct. 

I don't see any other steps here. The problem was straightforward once knowing the formula. The predicates given were about the radius being 11 cm, so applying the formula directly. No need for complex geometric reasoning beyond recalling the formula. 

So the final answer should be 1520.53 cm², rounded to two decimal places.
