MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the geometric setup. Let me list out each predicate and see how they connect.

We have a triangle ABC. It's mentioned that it's a right-angled triangle. Also, there's a RightAngle predicate at Angle(A,B,C). Wait, so the right angle is at point B? Because the angle is formed by points A, B, C, so vertex at B. So Triangle ABC is right-angled at B. 

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A), 30). Wait, Angle(B,C,A) would be the angle at point C, between points B, C, A. Wait, no—angle notation is usually the middle letter being the vertex. So Angle(B,C,A) is the angle at point C, with segments CB and CA. But since the triangle is right-angled at B, maybe that angle is one of the acute angles. Then another measure says MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C), 60). That angle is at point A, between points B, A, C. Wait, so angle at A is 60 degrees? Wait, but if the triangle is right-angled at B, then the other two angles should add up to 90 degrees. If one of them is 30 and the other is 60, that adds up to 90. So maybe angle at C is 30 degrees, angle at A is 60 degrees. Let me confirm.

So the triangle ABC is right-angled at B. Therefore, angles at A and C are complementary. Given that MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)) is 60 degrees. Wait, Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at A, because the middle letter is A. So angle at A is 60 degrees. Then angle at C would be 30 degrees, since total angles sum to 180. That makes sense. So angle at A is 60°, angle at B is 90°, angle at C is 30°.

Next, LengthOf(Line(B,C), x). So BC has length x. LengthOf(Line(A,C), SqrtOf(10)). So AC has length √10. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)). Since AB and BC are perpendicular, which confirms that the right angle is at B. 

Also, IsHypotenuseOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)). So AC is the hypotenuse. Which makes sense because in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at B, the hypotenuse is AC. So AC is the hypotenuse, which has length √10. 

Additionally, CosOf(30, RatioOf(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), LengthOf(Line(A,C)))). So cos(30°) equals the ratio of BC over AC. Since BC is x, and AC is √10, this gives us cos(30°) = x / √10. 

Wait, that seems like a key equation here. So we can solve for x directly. Let me write that down. 

cos(30°) = x / √10. Therefore, x = √10 * cos(30°). Now, cos(30°) is √3 / 2. So substituting that in, x = √10 * (√3 / 2) = (√30)/2. 

But wait, let me check if that aligns with the triangle's sides. In a right-angled triangle, with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Here, the hypotenuse is AC = √10. Let me think about which side corresponds to which. 

In a standard 30-60-90 triangle, the side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, then the side opposite 60° is longer, and the hypotenuse is twice the shortest leg. 

In our case, angle at C is 30°, so the side opposite angle C is AB. Wait, angle at C is 30°, so opposite side is AB. Wait, let me clarify:

In triangle ABC, right-angled at B. So sides:

- Opposite angle A (which is 60°): BC
- Opposite angle C (which is 30°): AB
- Hypotenuse AC.

Therefore, according to the ratios, the side opposite 30° (AB) is half the hypotenuse. Wait, no—the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. The shorter leg is opposite 30°, so AB is the shorter leg. Then hypotenuse AC = 2 * AB. However, in our case, the hypotenuse AC is √10, so AB would be √10 / 2. But in our problem, BC is the side adjacent to the 30° angle at C. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-examine.

Alternatively, since angle at A is 60°, angle at C is 30°, right angle at B. So the sides:

- Side opposite angle A (60°): BC
- Side opposite angle C (30°): AB
- Hypotenuse AC.

Thus, in terms of ratios:

For a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are 1 (opposite 30°), √3 (opposite 60°), and 2 (hypotenuse).

So here, the side opposite 30° is AB, which should be the shortest side. The hypotenuse AC is twice that. So AB = (AC)/2. But in our case, AC is √10, so AB = √10 / 2. However, the problem states that BC is the side with length x. What's BC?

BC is the side adjacent to angle C (30°) and opposite angle A (60°). So in the standard ratios, BC would correspond to the longer leg (since angle A is 60°, opposite BC). So the longer leg is BC, which is √3 times the shorter leg (AB). 

So if AB is the shorter leg (opposite 30°), then BC = AB * √3. And hypotenuse AC = 2 * AB. 

Given that AC = √10, then AB = √10 / 2. Then BC = (√10 / 2) * √3 = √30 / 2. Which matches the earlier calculation where x = √10 * cos(30°). Since cos(30°) is adjacent over hypotenuse, which would be BC / AC. Therefore, BC = AC * cos(30°) = √10 * (√3 / 2) = √30 / 2. 

So x is √30 divided by 2. Therefore, the exact value of x is √30 / 2. 

Let me verify once more. Using trigonometry, in triangle ABC, angle at C is 30°, so cos(angle C) = adjacent / hypotenuse. Adjacent to angle C is BC, hypotenuse is AC. So cos(30°) = BC / AC → BC = AC * cos(30°). Plugging in AC = √10, gives BC = √10 * (√3 / 2) = √30 / 2. Yes, that's correct. 

Alternatively, using the 30-60-90 ratios, since hypotenuse is √10, the sides are √10 / 2 (shorter leg, AB), √10*(√3)/2 (longer leg, BC), and hypotenuse √10. So BC is indeed √30 / 2. 

Therefore, the value of x is √30 divided by 2.
