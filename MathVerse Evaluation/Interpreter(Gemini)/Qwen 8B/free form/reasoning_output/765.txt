<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this geometry problem. So, we have a rectangle QRSP. Wait, the points are Q, R, S, P. Let me visualize that. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Also, there's a point T on PS such that the area of triangle RST is 7, and PT is 2/5 of PS. We need to find the area of PQRS, which I think is the same as the area of the rectangle QRSP.

First, let me recall that in a rectangle, the area is length times width. But maybe I can relate the given information about triangle RST to find these dimensions. 

So, the rectangle has sides QR, RS, SP, and PQ. Since it's a rectangle, QR is parallel and equal to SP, and RS is parallel and equal to PQ. Also, since T lies on PS, then PS is one of the sides. Let me consider coordinates to make this clearer. Maybe assigning coordinates to each point would help.

Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let's place point Q at the origin (0,0). Then, since QR is a side of the rectangle, let me suppose that R is at (a, 0) because QR is horizontal. Then, since it's a rectangle, moving up from Q to P, so if QR is horizontal, then PQ should be vertical. Wait, but the problem mentions that Line(Q,R) is parallel to Line(P,S). Also, Line(Q,P) is parallel to Line(R,S). Let me check.

Wait, Rectangle QRSP. So the order of the letters matters. If it's rectangle QRSP, then the vertices are connected as Q-R-S-P-Q? Or maybe Q-R-S-P? Let me confirm the connections. In a rectangle, consecutive points are connected. So if it's Q, R, S, P, then the sides are QR, RS, SP, and PQ. So, connecting Q to R, R to S, S to P, P back to Q. Therefore, QR and SP are opposite sides, RS and PQ are opposite sides.

Also, given that RightAngle(Angle(Q,R,S)) – that means angle at R between Q, R, S is a right angle. Similarly, other angles are right angles. So, yes, that confirms it's a rectangle.

Now, since T lies on PS. So PS is one of the sides. Let me assign coordinates again. Let me set coordinate system:

Let’s take Q at (0, 0). Since QR is a horizontal side, then R would be at (a, 0). Now, since RS is vertical upwards from R, because angle at R is right angle. Wait, no. Wait, if QR is horizontal from Q(0,0) to R(a, 0), then RS would go upward from R(a, 0). But since it's a rectangle, RS should be perpendicular to QR. So QR is along x-axis, so RS would be vertical. Thus, S would be at (a, b), where b is the height of the rectangle. Then P would be at (0, b), completing the rectangle. Because from S(a,b) to P(0,b)? No, wait. Wait, if you go from R(a,0) to S(a,b), then from S(a,b) to P... Well, since PQ connects back to Q(0,0). So from S(a,b) to P, which should connect back to Q(0,0). Wait, maybe my initial assumption is wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is labeled differently. Let me think again. If the rectangle is Q-R-S-P-Q, then the sides are QR, RS, SP, and PQ. So starting at Q, going to R, then to S, then to P, then back to Q. So, QR and SP are opposite sides, RS and PQ are opposite sides.

In that case, vectors QR and SP should be equal. So vector QR is R - Q, and vector SP is P - S. So if I assign coordinates accordingly.

But maybe it's easier to assign coordinates with Q at (0, 0), R at (a, 0), S at (a, b), and P at (0, b). That makes QRSP a rectangle with length QR = a, height RS = b. Then, PS is the side from P(0, b) to S(a, b), so that's horizontal? Wait no, if S is at (a, b), then PS goes from P(0, b) to S(a, b), which is horizontal. Wait, but earlier, I thought RS was vertical. Yes, in this setup, RS is vertical from R(a, 0) to S(a, b). Then SP is horizontal from S(a, b) to P(0, b)? Wait, no. From S(a, b) to P, which would be to (0, b)? That would mean SP is from (a, b) to (0, b), so leftward. So that's correct.

So the rectangle QRSP has coordinates Q(0,0), R(a,0), S(a,b), P(0,b). Then PS is the top side from P(0,b) to S(a,b). Wait, no, if S is at (a,b), then PS is from P(0,b) to S(a,b). So that's the top side. Then T is a point on PS. So T is somewhere along the line from P(0,b) to S(a,b). So parametrize that line. Let me denote T as (t, b), where t is between 0 and a. Because moving from P(0,b) to S(a,b), x-coordinate increases from 0 to a, y remains b.

Given that PT = 2/5 * PS. Wait, PT is the length from P to T, and PS is the entire length of PS. Since PS is horizontal, its length is a units (from x=0 to x=a). So PS length is a. Then PT is 2/5 * a. Therefore, since PT is from P(0,b) to T(t,b), the distance is |t - 0| = t. So t = 2/5 a. Therefore, T is at ( (2a/5), b ). 

Now, the area of triangle RST is 7. Let's compute that. Points R(a,0), S(a,b), T(2a/5, b). So triangle RST. Let me sketch mentally. R is at (a, 0), S is at (a, b), T is at (2a/5, b). So the base of the triangle could be RS, which is vertical from (a,0) to (a,b), length b. The base RS is vertical, and the third point T is to the left of S on the top side. Alternatively, we can calculate the area using coordinates.

Using coordinates, area of triangle with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3):

Area = | (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2 |.

Plugging in R(a,0), S(a,b), T(2a/5, b):

Area = | a*(b - b) + a*(b - 0) + (2a/5)*(0 - b) | / 2

Compute term by term:

First term: a*(b - b) = a*0 = 0

Second term: a*(b - 0) = a*b

Third term: (2a/5)*(0 - b) = (2a/5)*(-b) = -2ab/5

Sum: 0 + ab - 2ab/5 = (5ab - 2ab)/5 = 3ab/5

Take absolute value and divide by 2: |3ab/5| / 2 = 3ab/(10)

Wait, wait, no. Wait the formula is |sum| divided by 2. Wait the formula is already divided by 2. Wait original formula:

Area = | [x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)] / 2 |.

So in our calculation, sum inside is 0 + ab - 2ab/5 = 3ab/5. Then divide by 2: 3ab/10. So area is 3ab/10. And according to the problem, this equals 7. So:

3ab/10 = 7 → ab = 70/3.

But ab is the area of the rectangle QRSP, because area of rectangle is length × width, which here is QR (length a) multiplied by RS (height b). So area of rectangle is ab. Therefore, ab = 70/3 ≈ 23.333...

Wait but the question asks for the area of PQRS, which is the same as the rectangle QRSP. So the answer would be ab = 70/3. However, let me verify my calculation again, because sometimes mistakes happen in coordinate assignments.

Alternative approach: Let's compute area of triangle RST another way. Since RS is vertical from (a,0) to (a,b). Point T is at (2a/5, b). So the base RS has length b. The height relative to base RS would be the horizontal distance from T to the line RS. Since RS is the vertical line x=a, and T is at x=2a/5. So the horizontal distance is a - 2a/5 = 3a/5. Hence, area of triangle is ½ × base × height = ½ × b × 3a/5 = 3ab/10. Which matches previous result. Therefore 3ab/10 = 7 → ab = 70/3. Therefore area of rectangle is ab = 70/3. 

But wait, the problem says "the area of triangle RST is 7". So 3ab/10 = 7 ⇒ ab = 70/3. So the area of the rectangle is 70/3. Is that the answer? But let me check once more if I didn't mix up any steps.

Wait, but the problem mentions that PT = 2/5 * PS. PS is the length from P to S, which in our coordinate system is a. So PT = 2/5 * a. Since P is at (0,b), and T is at (2a/5, b), then PT is indeed 2a/5. So that part checks out. 

Therefore, solving 3ab/10 = 7 gives ab = 70/3. Therefore, area of rectangle is 70/3. But let me check if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe the rectangle is named differently. Suppose the rectangle is Q, R, S, P in order, but maybe the sides are different. Wait, but based on the given right angles, the structure seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the coordinates. Let me try another approach without coordinates.

Since QRSP is a rectangle, so PS is congruent to QR, and RS is congruent to QP. Given that T is on PS, and PT = 2/5 PS. Let me denote PS = x. Then PT = (2/5)x, so TS = PS - PT = x - (2/5)x = (3/5)x.

The area of triangle RST. Let's see. In rectangle QRSP, RS is one side, and PS is another. So triangle RST has base RS and height? Wait, not sure. Wait, if we consider base as RS, then the height would depend on where T is. Alternatively, since T is on PS, maybe we can think of triangle RST with base ST and height something else.

Alternatively, considering coordinates again might be safer. But given that in coordinates, we arrived at ab = 70/3, which would be the area of the rectangle. But 70/3 is approximately 23.333..., but maybe there's a simpler fraction or perhaps I messed up the ratio.

Wait, let me re-express the area of triangle RST. If PS is of length x, then in the coordinate system, x = a (since PS is from (0,b) to (a,b)). Then PT = 2/5 x, so T divides PS into PT = 2/5 x and TS = 3/5 x. 

Then, triangle RST: points R, S, T. RS is vertical with length equal to the height of the rectangle, say h. Wait, in the coordinate system, RS was from (a,0) to (a,b), so length b. So if I call the height of the rectangle as h, then RS = h. Then, the base of triangle RST could be RS (length h), and the height corresponding to this base would be the horizontal distance from T to the line RS. Since RS is vertical line at x = a, and T is located at x = 2a/5 (if PS is length a). So the horizontal distance is a - 2a/5 = 3a/5. Therefore, area of triangle RST is ½ * h * (3a/5). But since in the rectangle, the length a is the length of PS, which is equal to QR. Also, in the rectangle, the sides QR and PS are both equal to a. The height h is equal to RS, which is equal to PQ. 

But in terms of the rectangle's area, it's a*h. So if we have ½ * h * (3a/5) = 7. Then multiply both sides by 2: h*(3a/5) = 14. Then, area of rectangle is a*h = ?

If I write a*h = (something). Let me denote A = a*h. Then, from the equation:

h*(3a/5) = 14 → (3/5)(a*h) = 14 → (3/5)A = 14 → A = 14 * (5/3) = 70/3. Same result as before. So regardless of how I approach it, the area of the rectangle is 70/3. 

But the problem says "What is the area of PQRS?" So that's the same as the area of the rectangle QRSP, which is 70/3. Therefore, the answer is 70/3. However, I should check whether there's a miscalculation here. Let me verify once more.

Another way: Let me suppose specific numbers. Suppose a = 5, then PT = 2/5 * 5 = 2. So T is 2 units away from P along PS. Then, the horizontal distance from T to RS is a - PT = 5 - 2 = 3. Then area of triangle RST is ½ * base * height. Here, base RS is h, height is 3. So area is ½ * h * 3 = (3/2)h. According to the problem, this equals 7. Therefore, (3/2)h = 7 → h = 14/3. Then the area of the rectangle is a*h = 5*(14/3) = 70/3. Yep, same result. So seems correct.

Thus, the area of PQRS is 70/3. Therefore, the answer should be \boxed{\dfrac{70}{3}}.

But let me check if there's a possibility that the problem refers to PQRS as a different shape. Wait, the problem says "the graph consists of the rectangle QRPS and the line segment RT", so maybe the rectangle is named QRPS, meaning Q, R, P, S? Wait, but in that case, the order would affect the shape. Wait, if it's rectangle QRPS, then the order is Q-R-P-S-Q? That would make QR and RP adjacent sides? Wait, no. Let me think again. The rectangle is defined by four points, so the order is important. If it's QRPS, then the sides are QR, RP, PS, SQ? That would not form a rectangle unless certain conditions hold. But given that there are right angles at Q, R, S, P, as per the constraints. 

Wait, looking back at the problem statement:

"RightAngle(Angle(Q,R,S))
RightAngle(Angle(R,S,P))
RightAngle(Angle(S,P,Q))
RightAngle(Angle(P,Q,R))"

These indicate that at each vertex, there's a right angle. So, Angle(Q,R,S) is the angle at R between Q, R, S — which implies that QR and RS meet at R with a right angle. Similarly, Angle(R,S,P) is the angle at S between R, S, P — implying RS and SP meet at S with a right angle. So continuing around the rectangle, each corner has a right angle. Therefore, the rectangle is ordered Q-R-S-P-Q, forming a closed loop with right angles at each corner. Therefore, the rectangle is Q-R-S-P-Q, making the sides QR, RS, SP, and PQ. 

So, in this case, the rectangle's sides are QR, RS, SP, and PQ. Therefore, the coordinates assigned earlier are correct. So the area of the rectangle is QR * RS, which is a * b, leading us to 70/3. 

Hence, I think the answer is 70/3. Therefore, Final Answer: \boxed{\dfrac{70}{3}}

To determine the **area of quadrilateral PQRS**, which is confirmed to be a **rectangle** due to the presence of right angles at all vertices and parallel opposite sides, we proceed systematically through geometric reasoning and coordinate-based calculations.

### Step 1: Assigning Coordinates

We define the rectangle QRSP with the following coordinates:

- Let **Q** be at the origin: $ Q = (0, 0) $
- Let **R** lie horizontally from Q: $ R = (a, 0) $
- Let **S** be vertically above R: $ S = (a, b) $
- Finally, **P** completes the rectangle vertically from Q: $ P = (0, b) $

This configuration ensures that the sides of the rectangle are:

- $ QR = a $
- $ RS = b $
- $ SP = a $
- $ PQ = b $

Thus, the total **area of the rectangle** will be:

$$
\text{Area}_{QRSP} = a \cdot b
$$

---

### Step 2: Understanding the Triangle RST

It is given that:

- Point **T** lies on segment **PS**
- $ PT = \frac{2}{5} PS $, i.e., $ PT = \frac{2}{5}a $
- Therefore, the x-coordinate of **T** is $ x_T = \frac{2}{5}a $, while its y-coordinate is the same as **P** and **S**, namely $ y_T = b $
- So, the coordinates of **T** are:  
  $$
  T = \left( \frac{2a}{5}, b \right)
  $$

With the three points:

- $ R = (a, 0) $
- $ S = (a, b) $
- $ T = \left( \frac{2a}{5}, b \right) $

We compute the **area of triangle RST** using the standard determinant formula for the area of a triangle given three vertices:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
$$

Substituting:

- $ x_1 = a, y_1 = 0 $
- $ x_2 = a, y_2 = b $
- $ x_3 = \frac{2a}{5}, y_3 = b $

We get:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| a(b - b) + a(b - 0) + \frac{2a}{5}(0 - b) \right|
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + ab - \frac{2ab}{5} \right|
= \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3ab}{5}
= \frac{3ab}{10}
$$

We are told this area is **7**:

$$
\frac{3ab}{10} = 7 \Rightarrow ab = \frac{70}{3}
$$

---

### Step 3: Compute the Area of Rectangle QRSP

From the earlier definition, the area of the rectangle is:

$$
\text{Area}_{QRSP} = ab = \frac{70}{3}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\dfrac{70}{3}}
$$
