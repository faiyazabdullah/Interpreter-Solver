QUESTION:
Given the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at 9 and -9 and with y-axis at 3 and -3, determine its equation.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the equation of an ellipse that intersects the x-axis at 9 and -9, and the y-axis at 3 and -3. Hmm, ellipses... Right, the standard form of an ellipse centered at the origin (since the points are symmetric around O, which is (0,0)) would be something like (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1. Wait, but the points given are where it crosses the axes. 

Wait, the major axis is along the x-axis because the x-intercepts are farther out than the y-intercepts. So, the major axis length is 2a, and minor axis is 2b. Let me recall: for an ellipse, the distance from the center to the vertices along the major axis is 'a', and along the minor axis is 'b'. Since the ellipse passes through (9,0), plugging that into the equation gives (9²)/a² + 0 = 1 → 81/a² = 1 → a² = 81. Similarly, plugging (0,3) gives 0 + (3²)/b² = 1 → 9/b² = 1 → b² = 9. Therefore, the equation should be x²/81 + y²/9 = 1. But wait, let me check if there's more to it. 

But the problem mentions that O is the center, which is (0,0). So yes, the standard form applies here. Also, the foci are located along the major axis, but since they didn't mention foci, maybe we don't need that. The question just asks for the equation, so I think that's sufficient. Let me verify with the given points. If x=9, then substituting into the equation: (81)/81 + y²/9 = 1 → 1 + y²/9 = 1 ⇒ y=0, which matches the intercept. Similarly for y=3, x=0: x²/81 + 9/9 = 1 ⇒ 0 + 1 = 1. Correct. And the same for negative counterparts. So yeah, that seems right. 

Alternatively, could there be another form? Like if the ellipse was rotated? But the problem says it intersects the axes at those points, implying that the major and minor axes are aligned with the coordinate axes. Hence, no rotation. So the standard form is correct. Therefore, the equation is x²/81 + y²/9 = 1. To write it in a more expanded form, multiply both sides by 81*9 to eliminate denominators? But usually, the standard form is acceptable. Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator, but the simplest way is the standard form. 

So the final answer should be x squared over 81 plus y squared over 9 equals 1. In LaTeX, that's \frac{x^2}{81} + \frac{y^2}{9} = 1. Let me make sure I didn't mix up a and b. Since the major axis is along x, a is larger than b. Here, a² is 81, so a=9, and b² is 9, so b=3. That's consistent with the intercepts. Yep, that's correct.
