QUESTION:
For the following exercises, use the graph in Figure 7, which shows the profit, y, in thousands of dollars, of a company in a given year, t, where t represents the number of years since 1980. The line chart is begin from (15,150) and goes to (25,130).

Find the linear function  y,  where  y  depends on  t,  the number of years since 1980.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the linear function y that depends on t, where t is the number of years since 1980. The given points are A(15,150) and B(25,130), which are points on the line chart showing profit over time. 

First, I need to recall that a linear function has the form y = mt + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since we have two points on the line, we can find the slope first. The slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Here, the points are (15,150) and (25,130). Let me calculate the slope.

So, plugging in the values: m = (130 - 150)/(25 - 15) = (-20)/10 = -2. That gives us the slope as -2. Now, we need to find the y-intercept, b. To do that, we can use one of the points. Let's take point A (15,150). Plugging into the equation: 150 = -2*(15) + b. Calculating that, -2*15 is -30, so 150 = -30 + b. Adding 30 to both sides gives b = 180. 

Wait, but let me check with the other point to make sure. Using point B (25,130): 130 = -2*(25) + b → 130 = -50 + b → b = 180. Yep, same result. So the equation should be y = -2t + 180. But wait, let me think again. Wait, the x-coordinate here is t, right? Because t represents the number of years since 1980. So the points are (t, y), meaning that when t=15, y=150, and t=25, y=130. Therefore, our calculation is correct. 

But just to ensure there's no confusion, maybe I should write it as y = -2t + 180. Let me verify once more. At t=15, y would be -2*15 + 180 = -30 + 180 = 150, which matches point A. At t=25, y = -2*25 + 180 = -50 + 180 = 130, which matches point B. So that seems right. 

Therefore, the linear function is y = -2t + 180. So the final answer should be presented in LaTeX as y = -2t + 180. But let me check if there's any other consideration. The problem mentions the graph starts at (15,150) and goes to (25,130). So those are two points on the line, and we've correctly used them to find the equation. No other points are given, so this should be sufficient. 

I don't see any other geometric elements here besides the line connecting the two points. The rest of the predicates like PointLiesOnLine are just confirming that A and B are on the line AB, which is already accounted for in the problem setup. So the main task was to find the linear equation passing through those two points, which we did. 

Another thing to consider: the problem says "the line chart is begin from (15,150) and goes to (25,130)". Wait, does that mean that t starts at 15? Or is t the number of years since 1980, so t=0 corresponds to 1980. Therefore, the points given are for t=15 (which would be 1995) and t=25 (which would be 2005). But regardless, the linear function is determined purely by the two points given, so even if t is offset, the equation remains the same. 

No, actually, the problem states that t is the number of years since 1980. So the x-axis is t, and the points are (15,150) and (25,130). So the line is defined for these t-values. Therefore, the linear model is correct as found. 

Thus, the final answer is y = -2t + 180. In LaTeX, that would be written as y = -2t + 180, enclosed within the required format.
