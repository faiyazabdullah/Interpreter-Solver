QUESTION:
On the following unit circle, $\theta$ is in radians and $\tan (\theta)=\frac{0.98}{0.2}=4.9$. Without a calculator, evaluate the following expressions to the nearest hundredth or as an exact ratio.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a unit circle with point O at (0,0) and another point P at (0.2, 0.98). We're told that the line OP is a radius of the circle, so its length should be 1. Let me check that first. 

Calculating the distance between O(0,0) and P(0.2, 0.98): the formula is sqrt((0.2-0)^2 + (0.98-0)^2). That would be sqrt(0.04 + 0.9604) = sqrt(1.0004). Wait, that's approximately 1.0002, but since it's supposed to be a unit circle, maybe there's some rounding? But the problem says "unit circle," so maybe they approximated the coordinates of P?

But the main thing here is that tan(theta) = 4.9, where theta is the angle formed at the origin between points X and P. Wait, looking back, the question mentions angle(X, O, P), which I think means the angle at point O between points X and P. Since O is the center of the circle, and both X and P are points on the circle because they are radii. 

Given that, we need to find theta such that tan(theta) = 4.9. However, since we're dealing with a unit circle, the coordinates of P are (cos(theta), sin(theta))? Wait, no. Wait, if theta is the angle from the positive x-axis to the point P, then yes, P would be (cos(theta), sin(theta)). But in our case, the coordinates of P are given as (0.2, 0.98). Let me verify that.

If theta is the angle corresponding to point P, then cos(theta) = 0.2 and sin(theta) = 0.98. Then tan(theta) would be sin(theta)/cos(theta) = 0.98 / 0.2 = 4.9, which matches the given condition. So theta is the angle whose tangent is 4.9. Therefore, we need to find theta in radians such that tan(theta) = 4.9. 

But the question asks us to evaluate the expressions without a calculator. Hmm. How do we find theta given tan(theta) = 4.9? Well, perhaps we can relate this to a right triangle where the opposite side is 4.9 and adjacent is 1, making the hypotenuse sqrt(1^2 + 4.9^2). Wait, but how does that help us find theta?

Alternatively, maybe we can use known trigonometric identities or approximate the angle using series expansions? But without a calculator, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, since we know that tan(theta) = 4.9, and we need to find theta in radians. But the problem states that theta is in radians and we need to evaluate it. Wait, but maybe the question isn't directly asking for theta, but something else? Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the original problem says: "Without a calculator, evaluate the following expressions to the nearest hundredth or as an exact ratio." But what expressions? Wait, the user hasn't specified which expression to evaluate. Wait, looking back, the initial problem statement says: "evaluate the following expressions" but the actual text after that seems to refer to theta. Wait, maybe there was a formatting issue. Let me check again.

The user wrote: "On the following unit circle, θ is in radians and tan(θ)=0.98/0.2=4.9. Without a calculator, evaluate the following expressions..." Wait, maybe the question is actually to evaluate θ, given that tan(theta) = 4.9? Or perhaps to find the measure of angle XOP, which is theta?

Yes, since the angle mentioned is Angle(X, O, P), which is the angle at O between points X and P. Given that both X and P lie on the unit circle centered at O, and since X is given as (1, 0), which is the point (cos(0), sin(0)) = (1, 0). So point X is at angle 0 radians, and point P is at some angle theta where tan(theta) = 4.9. So the angle between X (which is along the positive x-axis) and P is theta. Thus, we need to find theta such that tan(theta) = 4.9. But how?

Since tan(theta) = 4.9, we can think about constructing a right triangle with opposite side 4.9 and adjacent side 1, so the hypotenuse would be sqrt(1 + 4.9²) = sqrt(1 + 24.01) = sqrt(25.01) ≈ 5.001. But how does that help us find theta? 

Alternatively, maybe we can use known angles. For example, tan(pi/2) approaches infinity, so theta is approaching pi/2 from below. Let me recall some standard angles. For instance, tan(pi/3) = √3 ≈ 1.732, tan(pi/4) = 1, tan(pi/2 - small epsilon) would be large. But 4.9 is quite large. So theta is close to pi/2. Let's see, maybe we can express theta as pi/2 - ε, where ε is a small angle. Then tan(theta) = tan(pi/2 - ε) = cot(ε) ≈ 1/ε. So setting 1/ε = 4.9 gives ε ≈ 1/4.9 ≈ 0.204 radians. Then theta ≈ pi/2 - 0.204. 

Pi is approximately 3.1416, so pi/2 is about 1.5708. Subtracting 0.204 gives roughly 1.5708 - 0.204 ≈ 1.3668 radians. To convert this to decimal, but wait, is there a better way? Let me compute 1.5708 - 0.204 = 1.3668. But how accurate is this approximation? Because tan(theta) = 4.9 implies that theta is slightly less than pi/2, but this method gives an approximate value. However, since the problem says to evaluate without a calculator, this seems like the intended approach. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Taylor series expansion for arctangent around pi/2? Not sure. Alternatively, use the fact that tan(theta) = 4.9, so theta = arctan(4.9). But without a calculator, how do we compute arctan(4.9)? Maybe we can relate it to known values. For example, knowing that tan(1.36 radians) is... Let me try estimating. 

Let me recall that tan(1.36 radians). Let me think. 1 radian is about 57.3 degrees, so 1.36 radians is roughly 77.8 degrees. Let me check tan(77.8 degrees). Since tan(75 degrees) is about 3.732, tan(80 degrees) is about 5.671. So 4.9 is between 75 and 80 degrees. Let's say theta is between 75 and 80 degrees. Converting 75 degrees to radians is 75 * pi/180 ≈ 1.308 radians. 80 degrees is 80 * pi/180 ≈ 1.396 radians. Our earlier estimate was 1.3668 radians, which is between these two. 

So let's take theta ≈ 1.3668 radians. But how precise can we get? If we need to round to the nearest hundredth, that would be two decimal places. Let's suppose that 1.3668 rounds to 1.37 radians. But how to confirm this? Alternatively, maybe we can use more accurate methods. 

Another idea: use the identity that tan(theta) = 4.9, so we can write theta = arctan(4.9). If we consider a right triangle with opposite side 4.9 and adjacent 1, the hypotenuse is sqrt(1 + (4.9)^2) = sqrt(1 + 24.01) = sqrt(25.01) ≈ 5.001. Now, if we consider the sine and cosine of theta. 

sin(theta) = opposite/hypotenuse = 4.9 / 5.001 ≈ 0.98. Similarly, cos(theta) = adjacent/hypotenuse = 1 / 5.001 ≈ 0.2. Which matches the coordinates of point P given in the problem: (0.2, 0.98). So this confirms that theta corresponds to the angle whose coordinates are (cos(theta), sin(theta)) = (0.2, 0.98). 

Therefore, theta is the angle whose cosine is 0.2 and sine is 0.98. But how to find theta in radians? Since we don't have a calculator, but we know that in radians, the relationship between sine and cosine. However, unless there's a known exact value for this angle, we might need to approximate. 

Alternatively, since we know that theta is in the first quadrant (since both sine and cosine are positive), and that it's close to pi/2. Let me use the inverse function. Suppose we want to find theta such that cos(theta) = 0.2. Then theta = arccos(0.2). Similarly, since cos(theta) = 0.2, and we know that cos(pi/2) = 0, so theta is just slightly less than pi/2. 

But again, how to calculate arccos(0.2) without a calculator? There's no standard angle with cosine 0.2. So maybe we need to approximate it. One method is to use the Taylor series expansion of arccos around a certain point. But that might be complicated. Another approach is to use iterative methods or known approximations. 

Alternatively, considering that we can relate this to the previous estimation. Earlier, we estimated theta ≈ 1.3668 radians. Let's check what tan(1.3668) is. But since we can't compute it without a calculator, maybe we can use the relation that tan(theta) = 4.9, and thus theta ≈ arctan(4.9). 

But if we have to give an answer without a calculator, maybe the question expects recognizing that theta is the angle corresponding to the coordinates (0.2, 0.98), which is the same as the angle whose tangent is 4.9. So, the problem might be expecting us to recognize that theta is arctan(4.9), and since we can't compute it numerically without a calculator, perhaps the answer is simply expressed as arctan(4.9), but the question says "to the nearest hundredth". 

Wait, but the problem says "evaluate the following expressions to the nearest hundredth or as an exact ratio." Since tan(theta) is given as 4.9, which is a rational number, but theta itself is irrational. However, the problem might expect us to use the known values of coordinates to find theta. 

Wait, but the coordinates of P are (0.2, 0.98), which correspond to cos(theta) = 0.2 and sin(theta) = 0.98. Therefore, theta can be found using either arcsin(0.98) or arccos(0.2). Again, without a calculator, how to compute these? 

Perhaps there's a trick here. Let me think. Since we know that tan(theta) = 4.9, and we can also note that in the unit circle, the coordinates satisfy x = cos(theta), y = sin(theta). Also, we know that tan(theta) = y/x = 0.98 / 0.2 = 4.9. So theta is the angle whose tangent is 4.9. 

However, since the problem asks to evaluate theta (or an expression involving theta) without a calculator, and to round to the nearest hundredth, maybe the expected approach is to use an approximation technique. 

One common method for approximating arctangent values without a calculator is to use the Taylor series expansion around a known point. For example, expanding arctan(x) around x=0, but that converges slowly for large x. Alternatively, using Padé approximants or other methods. 

Alternatively, since tan(theta) = 4.9, and we can use the identity that theta = pi/2 - epsilon, where epsilon is small. As before, tan(theta) = tan(pi/2 - epsilon) = cot(epsilon) = 1/tan(epsilon). So, if tan(theta) = 4.9, then tan(epsilon) = 1/4.9 ≈ 0.20408. 

Now, for small angles, tan(epsilon) ≈ epsilon. So, epsilon ≈ 0.20408 radians. Therefore, theta ≈ pi/2 - 0.20408. Pi/2 is approximately 1.5708 radians. So subtracting 0.20408 gives theta ≈ 1.5708 - 0.20408 = 1.3667 radians. Rounded to the nearest hundredth, that would be 1.37 radians. 

To check the accuracy of this approximation, let's consider that tan(epsilon) = 0.20408. Using the Taylor series for tan(epsilon) around epsilon=0: tan(epsilon) = epsilon + epsilon³/3 + 2*epsilon^5/15 + ... So if we take tan(epsilon) ≈ epsilon + epsilon³/3. Setting this equal to 0.20408:

Let’s assume epsilon is approximately 0.20408, but with a correction term. Let’s denote e = epsilon. So,

e + e³/3 ≈ 0.20408

We can start with e₀ = 0.20408. Compute e₀ + e₀³/3:

First, e₀ = 0.20408

Compute e₀³ = (0.20408)^3 ≈ 0.20408 * 0.20408 = ~0.04165 * 0.20408 ≈ 0.00849. Then divide by 3: ~0.00283. So total is 0.20408 + 0.00283 ≈ 0.20691. This is larger than 0.20408, so our initial guess overestimates. 

So we need to adjust e. Let's set up the equation:

e + e³/3 = 0.20408

Let’s make an initial guess e₁ = 0.20408 - adjustment. Let me rearrange:

e³/3 = 0.20408 - e

Assuming e is close to 0.204, let's try e = 0.204. Then e³/3 ≈ (0.204)^3 /3 ≈ (0.00849) /3 ≈ 0.00283. So 0.204 + 0.00283 ≈ 0.20683, which is higher than 0.20408. So need to decrease e. 

Suppose we take e = 0.204 - delta. Let's plug into the equation:

(0.204 - delta) + [(0.204 - delta)^3]/3 = 0.20408

Expanding [(0.204 - delta)^3] ≈ 0.204³ - 3*(0.204)^2 * delta + ... 

This seems getting too involved. Perhaps instead, since the difference is small, we can iterate once more. Let me take e = 0.204 - x, where x is small. 

From e + e³/3 = 0.20408, substituting e = 0.204 - x:

(0.204 - x) + [(0.204 - x)^3]/3 ≈ 0.20408

Approximate [(0.204 - x)^3] ≈ (0.204)^3 - 3*(0.204)^2*x. 

Thus:

0.204 - x + [ (0.204)^3 - 3*(0.204)^2*x ] / 3 ≈ 0.20408

Simplify:

0.204 - x + (0.204)^3 /3 - (3*(0.204)^2 *x)/3 ≈ 0.20408

Which becomes:

[0.204 + (0.204)^3 /3] - x - (0.204)^2 *x ≈ 0.20408

Calculate [0.204 + (0.204)^3 /3]:

Earlier, we had 0.204 + 0.00283 ≈ 0.20683. So:

0.20683 - x*(1 + 0.204^2) ≈ 0.20408

So:

0.20683 - x*(1 + 0.0416) ≈ 0.20408 → 0.20683 - x*1.0416 ≈ 0.20408

Subtract 0.20408 from both sides:

0.20683 - 0.20408 = x*1.0416 → 0.00275 = x*1.0416 → x ≈ 0.00275 / 1.0416 ≈ 0.00264

Thus, e ≈ 0.204 - 0.00264 ≈ 0.20136 radians.

So, epsilon ≈ 0.20136 radians. Therefore, theta ≈ pi/2 - 0.20136 ≈ 1.5708 - 0.20136 ≈ 1.3694 radians. Rounding to the nearest hundredth is 1.37 radians. 

Alternatively, if we take more iterations, we could get closer, but given the constraints of doing this manually, 1.37 radians seems reasonable. 

But let's check another approach. Suppose we use the small-angle approximation for epsilon. If we take tan(epsilon) ≈ epsilon + epsilon^3/3, and set that equal to 0.20408, and solve for epsilon numerically. 

Let me define f(e) = e + e³/3 - 0.20408 = 0. Starting with e₀ = 0.204, f(e₀) = 0.204 + (0.204)^3 /3 - 0.20408 ≈ 0.204 + 0.00283 - 0.20408 ≈ 0.00275. 

Next iteration: Newton-Raphson method. f'(e) = 1 + e². So next estimate is e₁ = e₀ - f(e₀)/f'(e₀) = 0.204 - 0.00275/(1 + (0.204)^2) ≈ 0.204 - 0.00275/(1 + 0.0416) ≈ 0.204 - 0.00275/1.0416 ≈ 0.204 - 0.00264 ≈ 0.20136, as before. 

Then compute f(e₁) = 0.20136 + (0.20136)^3 /3 - 0.20408. Calculate (0.20136)^3 ≈ 0.00815. Divide by 3: ≈0.002717. So total is 0.20136 + 0.002717 = 0.204077, which is very close to 0.20408. Hence, e ≈ 0.20136 radians. Therefore, theta ≈ pi/2 - e ≈ 1.5708 - 0.20136 ≈ 1.3694 radians. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 1.37 radians. 

Therefore, the value of theta is approximately 1.37 radians. 

But let's cross-validate this. If theta ≈ 1.37 radians, what is tan(theta)? Let's use the approximation. Theta ≈ 1.37 radians. Let's use the identity tan(pi/2 - e) = cot(e) = 1/tan(e). Here, e = pi/2 - theta ≈ 0.20136 radians. So tan(theta) = 1/tan(e). Since e ≈ 0.20136, tan(e) ≈ e + e³/3 ≈ 0.20136 + (0.20136)^3 /3 ≈ 0.20136 + 0.00272 ≈ 0.20408. Thus, tan(theta) ≈ 1/0.20408 ≈ 4.9, which matches the given condition. So this confirms that our approximation is correct. 

Hence, the measure of angle theta is approximately 1.37 radians when rounded to the nearest hundredth.
