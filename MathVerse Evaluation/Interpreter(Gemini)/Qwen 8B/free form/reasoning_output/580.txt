QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about how much Lucy forgot each day compared to the previous day. The context is a memory study where people remember content over days, and each day, Maximilian forgets 15% of what he remembered the day before. We need to find the percentage that Lucy forgot each day.

First, I need to parse the given geometric predicates. Wait, but how do these relate to the problem? Let me check again. The user mentioned that there are graphs representing the percentage of content remembered by Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) after t days. The axes are labeled with "days" on the x-axis and "recall percentage" on the y-axis. Also, there are some predicates given like points lying on lines, perpendicularity, and sides of shapes.

Hmm, maybe the graph is represented geometrically here. The predicates mention Line(recall percentage axis) and Line(days axis). So, the x-axis is the days axis, and the y-axis is the recall percentage axis. They also say that the two lines (days and recall percentage axes) are perpendicular. That makes sense because the x and y axes in a coordinate system are perpendicular.

The PointLiesOnLine predicates indicate that specific points lie on these axes. For example, Point(100) lies on the recall percentage axis, and Point(0) lies on both the days axis and the recall percentage axis. But wait, maybe those points are just markers? Like, the origin (0,0) is on both axes. The other point, Point(100), might be on the y-axis at (0, 100)? Not sure yet.

But the main thing is that the graphs are plotted with days on the x-axis and recall percentage on the y-axis. The question is about the rate at which Lucy forgets each day. Since Maximilian forgets 15% of the previous day's content, that means he retains 85% each day. So his recall percentage decreases by 15% daily. 

Wait, but the problem says "Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten 15% of what he could recount the day before." So if he had R% on day n, then on day n+1, he has R - 0.15R = 0.85R. Therefore, the retention rate is 85% per day. So the percentage forgotten each day is 15%, but the question is about Lucy. How does Lucy's data fit in?

The problem states that the graphs represent Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black). The question is asking, for Lucy, what percentage of the previous day's content did she forget each day? So we need to find the daily forgetting rate for Lucy, similar to Maximilian's 15%.

But how do we get that from the given geometric predicates? Maybe the graph's structure gives us clues. The predicates mention IsSideOf(Line(recall percentage axis), Shape(graph boundary)) and similarly for the days axis. This suggests that the graph's boundaries are formed by these axes. So the graph is likely a coordinate system where the x-axis is days and y-axis is recall percentage, with the graph boundary being the area covered by the curves for Maximilian and Lucy.

But how does that relate to the percentages? If we consider that the recall percentage decreases exponentially over time, since it's a decay process. For Maximilian, the formula would be R(t) = R0 * (0.85)^t, where R0 is the initial recall percentage. However, the problem doesn't give explicit equations, so perhaps we need to infer from the geometric setup.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in the perpendicularity of the axes. Since the axes are perpendicular, the graph is a standard Cartesian plane. The fact that the lines are perpendicular might not directly affect the calculation unless there's more to it. But the problem mentions that the graphs represent the percentage of content remembered, so the actual numerical values are on the axes. 

Wait, but the question is about the rate of forgetting. Since Maximilian's rate is given as 15% per day, but Lucy's rate isn't stated. However, the problem says that the graphs represent both Maximilian and Lucy's data. If we assume that the graphs follow the same pattern, but perhaps different rates? Or maybe there's a way to derive Lucy's forgetting rate from the graph's properties?

Wait, but without specific data points, how can we calculate it? Unless there's something missing here. Let me re-examine the problem statement. It says that each day, Maximilian forgets 15% of the previous day's content. So his recall decreases by 15% each day. The question is about Lucy, so maybe the graph shows that Lucy's recall follows a similar exponential decay, but with a different rate. However, the problem doesn't provide specific data points for Lucy. 

Wait, but maybe the geometric predicates have hidden information. Let me think again. The given predicates include that the lines (days axis and recall axis) are perpendicular. Also, certain points lie on these lines. For instance, Point(0) is on both the days axis and recall axis. Point(100) is on the recall axis. Maybe these points correspond to specific values on the graph. For example, the origin (0,0) is on both axes, and Point(100) is (0,100) on the recall axis. But how does that help?

Alternatively, maybe the graph boundary refers to the shape of the curve. If the graph boundary is defined by the axes and the curves, then the curves are functions. But without knowing the equation of Lucy's curve, how can we find her forgetting rate?

Wait, the problem may be expecting us to realize that since Maximilian's forgetting rate is 15% per day, and assuming that Lucy's graph is similar but with a different rate, but the problem doesn't give enough info. However, the presence of the geometric predicates might suggest another approach.

Wait, the question is about the percentage forgotten each day. For Maximilian, it's 15%. So the formula for his recall on day t is R(t) = R0*(1 - r)^t, where r is the daily forgetting rate. Here, r = 0.15. Therefore, the percentage forgotten each day is r*previous day's content. But the problem asks for Lucy's rate. If the graphs are given, but no specific data points, perhaps there's an assumption that both follow the same model? But that's not indicated.

Wait, but maybe the geometric predicates imply that the graph is linear? No, because the recall percentage decreases exponentially. Alternatively, if the graph were linear, the forgetting rate would be constant. But in reality, it's exponential decay.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Since Maximilian forgets 15% each day, the question is about Lucy. But the problem doesn't state anything about Lucy's forgetting rate. Unless the graph's slope indicates the rate. However, without seeing the graph, how can we know?

Wait, but the problem is presented in a geometric context with given predicates, so perhaps there's a way to deduce it from the given information. Let me look back at the predicates again:

- PointLiesOnLine(Point(100),Line(recall percentage axis)): So the line called 'recall percentage axis' passes through the point (100). Assuming that the recall percentage axis is the y-axis, then the y-axis goes through (0,0) and (100,0)? Wait, no. In standard coordinates, the y-axis has x=0. If the Line(recall percentage axis) is the y-axis, then points on it have x-coordinate 0. But the point (100) is said to lie on it. That seems odd unless the point is (0,100). Wait, maybe the coordinates are written differently. For example, maybe the Line(recall percentage axis) is the vertical axis (y-axis), and the point (100) is (0,100). Similarly, Point(0) lies on both axes, implying that the origin is (0,0).

If that's the case, then the graph is plotted with days on the x-axis and recall percentage on the y-axis. The recall percentage decreases over days. For Maximilian, each day he forgets 15% of the previous day's content, so his recall percentage is multiplied by 0.85 each day. So the function for Maximilian is R(t) = R0 * (0.85)^t.

Now, for Lucy, if her graph is similar but with a different decay factor, we'd need more information. However, the problem doesn't give specific data points for Lucy. But maybe the question assumes that both follow the same model? That seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the geometric setup implies that the graphs are straight lines, leading to a constant rate of forgetting, but that contradicts the exponential decay.

Wait, but the problem says that the graphs represent the percentage of content remembered after t days. If the graphs are exponential decays, then the percentage forgotten each day is the same fraction of the previous day's amount. For Maximilian, it's 15%, so the question is asking for Lucy's equivalent rate.

But without additional data, how can we determine Lucy's rate? There must be something else. Let me re-examine the predicates again.

The predicates mention that the two lines (days axis and recall axis) are perpendicular. Also, the shapes (graph boundary) have sides on these lines. Maybe the graph boundary is a rectangle or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is testing understanding of exponential decay models, and the geometric predicates are just context. Given that, the answer is that Lucy's forgetting rate is the same as Maximilian's, but that seems incorrect. Or maybe the problem expects that since the axes are perpendicular, the rate is determined by the slope of the line... but without specific data, it's unclear.

Wait, the problem might be a trick question. Since Maximilian forgets 15% each day, the question is about Lucy. But if the graphs are given, and assuming that Lucy's graph is similar, but the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the answer is 15%? But that seems too straightforward. Or maybe the question is a misdirection, and the answer is 15% regardless of who it is.

Wait, but the problem says "each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten 15%..." So the question is about Lucy. If the graphs show that Lucy's recall follows the same pattern, then the answer is 15%, but that's not necessarily true. Without more information, we can't assume that. But given that the problem includes geometric predicates, maybe there's a clue.

Wait, looking back at the predicates:

- PointLiesOnLine(Point(0),Line(days axis)) → So the days axis passes through (0, something?), but the days axis is the x-axis. So Point(0) is on the days axis, which would mean it's (0, y) on the x-axis? No, the x-axis is horizontal. Points on the x-axis have y=0. So Point(0) is (0,0). Then, Point(0) also lies on the recall percentage axis (y-axis), which would make sense as the origin.

Point(100) lies on the recall percentage axis, which is the y-axis, so that point would be (0, 100). So the y-axis goes from (0,0) up to (0,100). The days axis is the x-axis, going from (0,0) onwards.

Then, the lines are perpendicular, which they are in a standard coordinate system.

Now, the question is about the percentage forgotten each day. Suppose that the graph for Maximilian is an exponential decay curve starting at (0,100%) and decreasing by 15% each day. Similarly for Lucy, but with a different rate. But since we don't have Lucy's data, how can we find her rate?

Wait, but maybe the problem is designed such that the graphs are straight lines, implying a constant rate of forgetting. For example, if the graph is linear, then the decrease is constant each day. But that's not consistent with exponential decay. However, if the graph is linear, then the percentage forgotten each day would be the same, but the problem states that Maximilian's forgetting is 15% of the previous day's content, which is exponential.

This is confusing. Perhaps the key lies in the fact that the axes are perpendicular, and the graph boundary is formed by them. If the graph boundary is a right angle, then maybe the rate is determined by the slope? But again, without specific data, I can't see how.

Alternatively, since the problem is presented in a geometric context, maybe it's a matter of interpreting the axes. The y-axis is recall percentage, and the x-axis is days. So the graph's vertical axis measures recall percentage, and the horizontal axis measures time. The question is about the rate of change of recall percentage over time, which would be the derivative of the recall function. But since we're dealing with discrete days, it's a difference quotient.

For Maximilian, the recall on day t is 0.85^t times initial. So the difference between day t and t-1 is R(t) - R(t-1) = R(t-1)(0.85 - 1) = -0.15*R(t-1). So the percentage decrease is 15% of the previous day's value. Thus, the percentage forgotten each day is 15%.

But the question is about Lucy. If the graph for Lucy is similar, but we don't have specifics, but the problem says that the graphs represent both. If the problem assumes that both follow the same model, then Lucy's rate is also 15%. But that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup, and the answer is 15%.

But why provide the geometric predicates then? Maybe the geometric setup is a red herring, or perhaps the problem is testing understanding of exponential decay models in a geometric context. Since the axes are perpendicular, and the points lie on them, but the actual calculation relies on the exponential decay formula.

Given that, the answer is 15%, same as Maximilian. But why would the question ask about Lucy then? Unless there's more to it.

Wait, maybe the problem is referring to the fact that Lucy's graph is a straight line, implying a constant rate. For example, if the recall percentage decreases by a fixed amount each day, rather than a percentage. But the problem states that Maximilian forgets 15% of the previous day's content, which is a percentage, not a fixed amount. So if Lucy's graph is a straight line, then the rate would be a fixed percentage of the initial amount, not of the previous day's. Hence, different from Maximilian.

But without knowing Lucy's graph details, we can't compute her rate. This suggests that either the problem is missing information, or there's an implicit assumption.

Wait, maybe the problem is designed to test the understanding that the percentage forgotten each day is the same for both participants, but that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the answer is 15%, as given for Maximilian, assuming that the graphs are similar. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, since the problem mentions that the graphs are for Maximilian and Lucy, and that the axes are perpendicular, maybe the slopes of the lines represent the forgetting rates. But without specific data points, we can't determine the slope.

At this point, I think the intended answer is 15%, as the problem might be testing the understanding that the percentage forgotten is the same for both, even though it's only explicitly given for Maximilian. Or maybe the geometric predicates are irrelevant, and the answer is simply 15%.

But that feels off. Let me think again. The problem says that each day, Maximilian forgets 15% of what he could recount the day before. This means that the percentage forgotten is 15% of the previous day's content. So, for example, if he had 100% on day 0, then day 1 is 85%, day 2 is 85% of 85% = 72.25%, etc. The percentage forgotten each day is always 15% of the previous day's amount. 

So, for Lucy, if her graph follows the same pattern, then the answer would be 15%. But the problem doesn't state that Lucy follows the same model. However, since the question is about the percentage forgotten each day, and the only given information is about Maximilian, maybe the answer is still 15%? Or is there a way to derive it from the geometric predicates?

Alternatively, the problem might involve calculating the slope of the line for Lucy's graph. If the graph is a straight line, then the slope would represent the rate of change. But since the recall percentage decreases, the slope would be negative. However, the problem states that the recall decreases by a percentage of the previous day's amount, which is exponential, not linear. So a straight line would imply a constant absolute decrease, not relative.

Given that, I'm stuck. The geometric predicates don't seem to provide the necessary information to calculate Lucy's forgetting rate. The only given data is about Maximilian's rate, and the question is about Lucy. Unless the answer is 15%, despite the lack of information.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. Since the axes are perpendicular, and the recall percentage decreases, the rate is determined by the slope of the line. But again, without specific data points, this is impossible.

Wait, perhaps the problem is testing the concept that the percentage forgotten is the same as the rate of decrease in the graph. For example, if the graph for Lucy is a straight line from (0, 100) to (1, 85), then the slope would be -15, indicating a 15% decrease. But this would be a linear model, not exponential. However, the problem states that Maximilian's forgetting is 15% of the previous day's content, which is exponential. So if Lucy's graph is linear, then the answer would differ.

But without knowing Lucy's graph, I can't proceed. Given that, perhaps the correct answer is 15%, assuming that both follow the same model. Even though the problem doesn't state this, it might be implied. Alternatively, the problem might expect that the percentage forgotten is the same as Maximilian's, hence 15%.

Since the problem provides geometric predicates, but none seem to link to the forgetting rate, I'll go with the assumption that the answer is 15%, as it's the only given rate, and the question might be testing the understanding that both follow the same pattern. Therefore, the answer is 15%.
