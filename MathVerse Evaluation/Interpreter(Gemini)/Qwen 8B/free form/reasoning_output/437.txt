QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (-1,3) and (-1,-3). It's center is at (-1,0) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at (-1,$3\sqrt{2}$) and (-1, -$3\sqrt{2}$). Find the equation of the hyperbola.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think>
Okay, so I need to find the equation of a hyperbola given some specific points. Let me start by recalling what I know about hyperbolas. 

First, the standard form of a hyperbola depends on whether it's opening vertically or horizontally. Since the vertices are at (-1, 3) and (-1, -3), both have the same x-coordinate, which is -1. That means the transverse axis is vertical. So the hyperbola opens up and down. 

The general equation for a vertical hyperbola is ((y - k)^2)/a^2 - ((x - h)^2)/b^2 = 1, where (h, k) is the center. The vertices are located at (h, k ± a). 

Looking at the given vertices: (-1, 3) and (-1, -3). The center of the hyperbola should be midway between the vertices. The midpoint between (-1, 3) and (-1, -3) would be (-1, 0). So the center (h, k) is (-1, 0). That matches the information given that the center is at (-1, 0).

Now, the distance from the center to each vertex is 'a'. The vertices are 3 units above and below the center. So a = 3. Therefore, a² = 9.

Next, the foci of a hyperbola are located at (h, k ± c), where c is the distance from the center to each focus. The foci given here are at (-1, 3√2) and (-1, -3√2). So c is 3√2. Thus, c² = (3√2)² = 9*2 = 18.

For hyperbolas, the relationship between a, b, and c is c² = a² + b². We can solve for b² using this formula. 

Plugging in the known values:

c² = a² + b²  
18 = 9 + b²  
So, b² = 18 - 9 = 9. Wait, that gives b² = 9? But then b would be 3. Hmm, but let me check again. Wait, no. Wait, if c² is 18, and a² is 9, then yes, b² = c² - a²? No! Wait, wait. Wait, for hyperbolas, it's c² = a² + b². So solving for b², we get b² = c² - a². 

Wait, so if c² = 18, and a² = 9, then b² = 18 - 9 = 9. So b² = 9. So then the equation becomes:

((y - k)^2)/a² - ((x - h)^2)/b² = 1  
Substituting h = -1, k = 0, a² = 9, b² = 9:

(y - 0)^2 / 9 - (x - (-1))^2 / 9 = 1  
Which simplifies to:

y²/9 - (x + 1)^2 / 9 = 1  

But wait, let me double-check. Because sometimes I mix up the formulas for hyperbola and ellipse. For hyperbola, yes, c² = a² + b². So if the vertices are along y-axis, then the equation is as above. However, let me confirm the coordinates of the foci. 

The foci are at (-1, 3√2) and (-1, -3√2). Given that the center is (-1, 0), then the distance from the center to each focus is c = 3√2, which squares to 18. And since a² is 9, then indeed b² = c² - a² = 18 - 9 = 9. 

Therefore, substituting all into the equation:

[(y - k)^2]/a² - [(x - h)^2]/b² = 1  
[(y - 0)^2]/9 - [(x - (-1))^2]/9 = 1  
Simplifying:

y²/9 - (x + 1)^2 / 9 = 1  

Alternatively, multiplying numerator and denominator, maybe we can write it as:

(y²)/(9) - [(x + 1)^2]/9 = 1  

But perhaps we can simplify further. If we multiply both sides by 9, we get:

y² - (x + 1)^2 = 9. 

But the standard form is usually left as fractions. However, depending on how the question wants the answer. Let me check if there's any mistake here. 

Wait, but let me verify with another approach. Let me recall that for a vertical hyperbola, the equation is ((y - k)^2)/a² - ((x - h)^2)/b² = 1. 

Given that the center is at (-1, 0), so h = -1, k = 0. Then the vertices are at (h, k ± a). Which would be (-1, 0 + 3) and (-1, 0 - 3), i.e., (-1, 3) and (-1, -3). That's correct. 

Foci are at (h, k ± c). Here, they are at (-1, 0 + 3√2) and (-1, 0 - 3√2). Correct. 

Then, since c² = a² + b² => 18 = 9 + b² => b² = 9. So the equation is:

(y - 0)^2 / 9 - (x - (-1))² / 9 = 1  
Which simplifies to:

y²/9 - (x + 1)² / 9 = 1  

Alternatively, combining terms:

[ y² - (x + 1)^2 ] / 9 = 1  
Multiply both sides by 9:

y² - (x + 1)^2 = 9  

But either form is acceptable. However, the standard form is typically written with denominators. So the first version is more standard. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the answer in the form that expands the terms. Let me see. 

But the problem says "Find the equation of the hyperbola." In most cases, unless specified otherwise, the standard form is preferred. So the equation would be:

(y²)/9 - [(x + 1)^2]/9 = 1  

Or, simplifying the denominators, since both denominators are 9, it can be written as:

(y² - (x + 1)^2)/9 = 1  

But perhaps even more simplified, expanding the numerator:

y² - (x² + 2x + 1) = 9  
y² - x² - 2x - 1 = 9  
Then bringing 9 to the left side:

y² - x² - 2x - 1 - 9 = 0  
y² - x² - 2x - 10 = 0  

But this might not be necessary. The standard form is better. Let me check if my calculation of b² is correct. 

Yes, because c² = a² + b². Given that c = 3√2, so c² = 18. a² = 9. Hence, b² = 18 - 9 = 9. So that part is correct. 

Another way to think: Maybe the hyperbola could be written as y²/a² - (x + 1)^2/b² = 1. With a=3, b=3. 

Thus, the equation is y²/9 - (x + 1)^2/9 = 1. 

Alternatively, if we factor out 1/9, it's [(y²) - (x + 1)^2]/9 = 1. 

Either way, the answer is correct. 

I don't see any errors in this reasoning. The key steps were identifying the orientation based on the vertices, finding the center, calculating a and c, then solving for b², and plugging into the standard form. 

Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is y²/9 - (x + 1)^2/9 = 1. 

But just to make sure, let me test one of the foci. Take the point (-1, 3√2). Plugging into the equation:

Left-hand side: [(3√2)^2]/9 - [(-1 + 1)^2]/9 = (9 * 2)/9 - 0 = 2 - 0 = 2 ≠ 1. Wait, that's not equal to 1. What did I do wrong?

Oh no! Wait, that suggests an error. Let me re-examine. 

If the equation is y²/9 - (x + 1)^2 /9 = 1, then plugging in the focus (-1, 3√2):

y² term: ( (3√2)^2 ) /9 = (9 * 2)/9 = 2  
(x + 1)^2 term: [(-1 + 1)^2]/9 = 0  
So total is 2 - 0 = 2 ≠ 1. Which contradicts the equation. 

That means there's a mistake here. Where did I go wrong? 

Ah! Wait, the standard form for hyperbola is ((y - k)^2)/a² - ((x - h)^2)/b² = 1. But if the foci are along the y-axis, then the formula is correct. However, the calculation of b² was done incorrectly. Wait, earlier I said that c² = a² + b². But in this case, the value of c is sqrt(a² + b²). 

Wait, let me redo that. 

We had c = 3√2, so c² = 18. 

a² is 9. 

So, according to the formula c² = a² + b², then b² = c² - a² = 18 - 9 = 9. 

So that part is still correct. 

But why does plugging in the focus give 2 instead of 1? Because the foci are not on the hyperbola, right? The hyperbola equation doesn't require the foci to satisfy the equation. The foci are points related to the hyperbola's properties, not lying on it. So my mistake was testing the focus in the equation, which isn't supposed to lie on the hyperbola. 

Therefore, the equation is correct. The confusion came from testing a focus in the hyperbola equation, which is incorrect. 

Hence, the equation remains y²/9 - (x + 1)^2/9 = 1. 

Alternatively, if I want to write it as:

(y^2)/9 - [(x + 1)^2]/9 = 1

Which is equivalent to:

(y^2 - (x + 1)^2)/9 = 1

Multiplying both sides by 9:

y^2 - (x + 1)^2 = 9

But that's also correct. Either form is acceptable. Depending on the required answer format. 

Since the problem mentions the hyperbola is in blue with given points, and asks for the equation, either form is okay. However, often the standard form is preferred. 

Let me check once again. Suppose we take a vertex at (-1, 3). Plug into the equation:

y²/9 - (x + 1)^2 /9 = (9)/9 - 0 = 1. Correct. 

Similarly, for the other vertex (-1, -3): y²/9 is 9/9 = 1. Correct. 

So the equation works for the vertices. 

Therefore, the correct equation is y²/9 - (x + 1)^2 /9 = 1. 

Alternatively, simplifying further, we can write it as:

(y² - (x + 1)^2) = 9

But the standard form with denominators is probably better. 

So the final answer is \boxed{\dfrac{y^2}{9} - \dfrac{(x + 1)^2}{9} = 1}
</think>

To determine the equation of the hyperbola, we begin by analyzing the geometric configuration provided:

---

### **Step 1: Identify the Orientation**

The vertices of the hyperbola are given as `(-1, 3)` and `(-1, -3)`. These points share the same **x**-coordinate, indicating that the transverse axis lies **vertically**, and thus the hyperbola opens **upward and downward**.

This tells us the general form of the hyperbola will be:

$$
\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1
$$

Where:
- `(h, k)` is the center,
- `a` is the distance from the center to the vertices,
- `c` is the distance from the center to the foci,
- `b` relates to the conjugate axis via the identity: $ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $

---

### **Step 2: Determine Key Parameters**

#### **Center**
The center is the midpoint of the vertices:
$$
\left(\frac{-1 + (-1)}{2}, \frac{3 + (-3)}{2}\right) = (-1, 0)
$$

So, the center is at `(-1, 0)`.

#### **Vertices**
Distance from center to each vertex is:
$$
|3 - 0| = 3 \Rightarrow a = 3 \Rightarrow a^2 = 9
$$

#### **Foci**
Foci are at `(-1, 3√2)` and `(-1, -3√2)`, so:
$$
c = 3\sqrt{2} \Rightarrow c^2 = 18
$$

Using the identity $ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 $, compute $ b^2 $:
$$
b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 18 - 9 = 9
$$

---

### **Step 3: Write the Equation**

Plug in the values into the standard form:

$$
\frac{(y - 0)^2}{9} - \frac{(x - (-1))^2}{9} = 1
$$

Simplify:

$$
\frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{(x + 1)^2}{9} = 1
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{\dfrac{y^2}{9} - \dfrac{(x + 1)^2}{9} = 1}
$$
