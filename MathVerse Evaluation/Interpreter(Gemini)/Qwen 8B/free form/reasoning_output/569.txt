QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the equation for function g, which is a translated version of f(x) = x². The problem gives some predicates that we need to use. Let me start by going through each part step by step.

First, the given predicates mention that f and g are both parabolas. Also, Blue(f) and Red(g), so f is blue and g is red. The Equals(f, Pow(x,2)) means that f is y = x². Then there's VerticalTranslation(g, f). So vertical translation implies that g is shifted vertically compared to f. But wait, vertical translations affect the y-value. However, sometimes people refer to vertical shifts as moving up or down. But maybe I should check other clues.

The IsVertexOf(Point(A), f) and IsVertexOf(Point(B), g). Point A is (0,0) because Equals(A, (0,0)), and Point B is (0,-2) since Equals(B, (0,-2)). So the vertex of parabola f is at point A, which is (0,0). That makes sense because the standard parabola y = x² has its vertex at (0,0). 

Now, for parabola g, its vertex is at point B, which is (0,-2). Since vertical translation moves the vertex up or down, if the original vertex is at (0,0) and the new one is at (0,-2), that suggests that g is shifted down by 2 units. Therefore, the equation of g would be taking the original f(x) = x² and subtracting 2, resulting in g(x) = x² - 2. Wait, but let me make sure there isn't a horizontal shift involved here. The problem mentions VerticalTranslation(g, f), so it's specifically a vertical shift, not horizontal. So no horizontal component. Hence, the equation should just be y = x² - 2.

Let me cross-check with the other predicates. There's also PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x,y)) and PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(x,y)), but I'm not sure how that relates directly. Maybe those lines are something else? Or perhaps they're referring to the axes? Wait, Line(x,y) could be the coordinate system's axes. But since A is (0,0) and B is (0,-2), they lie on the y-axis. So Line(x,y) might represent the y-axis? Not sure if that affects the parabola equations. But since the vertical translation is already accounted for by shifting the vertex down 2 units, that seems sufficient.

Another thing to consider: the problem states that g is a translated version of f. Since vertical translation is specified, and the vertex is moved from (0,0) to (0,-2), the transformation is a vertical shift downward by 2 units. Thus, substituting into the equation, the equation for g(x) would indeed be x squared minus 2. 

I think that covers all the given information. The key points were identifying the vertices of both parabolas and understanding the vertical translation. No horizontal shifts are mentioned, so the equation remains simple.
