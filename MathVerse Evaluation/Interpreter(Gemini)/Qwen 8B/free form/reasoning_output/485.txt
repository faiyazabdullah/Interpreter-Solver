MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question says there's a curve starting from the solid point (1,0) with an end arrow going through (-4,4). We need to find the domain and range of the function using interval notation. 

First, I need to parse the given predicates. There are points A and B defined. Point A is (1,0), and Point B is (-4,4). Also, there's a line L such that point B lies on line L. The domain is given as (-∞,1] and the range as [0, ∞). Wait, but the question is about finding the domain and range of the function represented by this curve. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the curve is a function? Since it starts at (1,0) and goes through (-4,4), perhaps we're supposed to model this as a function. But how? Let me think.

If the curve is a function, then each input x has one output y. The domain would be all x-values where the function is defined, and the range would be all y-values. The problem mentions that the curve starts at (1,0) and ends at (-4,4). Wait, but usually functions have domain and range based on their definition. However, since the curve starts at (1,0) and passes through (-4,4), maybe it's a function whose domain includes x-values from some minimum up to 1, and the range includes y-values from 0 upwards?

But wait, the problem states "the curve starts from a solid point (1,0) with an end arrow going through (-4,4)". That wording suggests that the curve begins at (1,0) and extends towards (-4,4), possibly implying that the domain starts at x=1 and goes to x=-4? But that doesn't make sense because x decreases from 1 to -4. Wait, but if the curve is a function, then x is the independent variable, so the domain would be the set of x-values covered by the curve. If the curve starts at x=1 and goes through x=-4, then the domain would be from -4 to 1? But the problem mentions the domain as (-∞,1]. Maybe I'm misunderstanding something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the curve is part of a function whose domain is restricted. Wait, the original problem gives the domain as (-∞,1] and range as [0, ∞). Wait, no—the user wrote that the domain is (-inf,1] and range is [0, inf). But the question is to write the domain and range of the function using interval notation. Wait, but the problem statement says "Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation." So maybe the function's domain and range are already given? No, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe the problem is that the curve is a function, and based on the points (1,0) and (-4,4), we need to deduce its domain and range. But how?

Wait, maybe the curve is a straight line? Because there's a line L mentioned, and point B lies on line L. If the curve is the line segment from (1,0) to (-4,4), then the domain would be from x=-4 to x=1. But the problem mentions an end arrow, which could imply that the curve continues beyond the endpoint. Wait, but if it's a line extending infinitely, then the domain would be all real numbers, but the given domain is (-∞,1]. So that contradicts. Alternatively, maybe the curve is a ray starting at (1,0) and passing through (-4,4), extending infinitely in the direction away from (1,0). In that case, the domain would be x ≤1, since it starts at x=1 and goes leftward. Similarly, the range would depend on the slope of the line.

Let me check. If the curve is a straight line starting at (1,0) and passing through (-4,4), then the line's equation can be found. Let's calculate the slope first. The slope m between (1,0) and (-4,4) is (4 - 0)/(-4 - 1) = 4 / (-5) = -4/5. Then the equation of the line can be written using point-slope form. Using point (1,0):

y - 0 = -4/5 (x - 1)

So y = -4/5 x + 4/5.

Now, if the curve is a ray starting at (1,0) and going through (-4,4), then the domain would be all x-values less than or equal to 1, since it starts at x=1 and extends to the left (since moving from (1,0) towards (-4,4) is decreasing x). Therefore, the domain would be (-∞,1]. 

For the range, since the line has a negative slope, as x decreases (goes to -infty), y increases. At x approaching -infty, y approaches infinity. At x=1, y=0. So the range would be [0, ∞). 

Therefore, combining these, the domain is (-∞,1] and the range is [0, ∞). Which matches the given domain and range in the problem statement. Wait, but the problem says "there is a curve start from a solid point (1,0) with an end arrow going through (-4,4)"—so maybe the curve is the entire line, but the domain is restricted to x ≤1? Or maybe the curve is just the portion from (1,0) onwards along the line. 

Given that the problem asks us to write the domain and range of the function, and the given domain and range are (-∞,1] and [0, ∞), respectively, then the answer should be those intervals. But why does the problem mention the curve going through (-4,4)? Because the line passes through (-4,4), which is part of the domain. But the domain is all x ≤1, so x can go to -infinity, hence the domain is (-∞,1]. And since the line has a negative slope, as x decreases, y increases without bound, so the range is [0, ∞).

Thus, the answer should be domain (-∞,1] and range [0, ∞).
