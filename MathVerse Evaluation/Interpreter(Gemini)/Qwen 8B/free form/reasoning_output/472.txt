State the centre of the semicircle.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the center of the semicircle that passes through these points: (-7,0), (-5,-5), (0,-7), (5,-5), and (7,0). Hmm, so first, since all these points lie on a circle, the center should be equidistant from all of them. Wait, but it's a semicircle, so maybe the diameter is along some line? Or maybe the semicircle is part of a full circle?

Wait, the problem mentions a semicircle, but all the given points are on a circle. Maybe the semicircle is just half of that circle? So the center would still be the same as the center of the full circle. Let me check.

First, I need to find the center of the circle passing through these five points. But wait, normally three non-collinear points determine a unique circle. However, here there are five points. If they are all on the same circle, then the center can be found by solving equations based on two points, then verifying with others.

Let me start by taking two points and finding the perpendicular bisectors. Let's pick points A(-7,0) and E(7,0). These are symmetric about the y-axis. The midpoint between A and E is ((-7+7)/2, (0+0)/2) = (0,0). The line AE is horizontal, so its perpendicular bisector is the vertical line through (0,0), which is the y-axis. So the center lies somewhere on the y-axis? Wait, no—the perpendicular bisector of AE is the y-axis. Therefore, the center has coordinates (0, k) for some k.

Now let's take another point, say B(-5,-5). Since the center is (0,k), the distance from the center to B should equal the radius. Similarly for other points.

So distance squared from center (0,k) to B(-5,-5) is (-5 - 0)^2 + (-5 - k)^2 = 25 + (k + 5)^2.

Similarly, distance squared from center to A(-7,0) is (-7 - 0)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = 49 + k².

Since both distances must be equal:

25 + (k + 5)^2 = 49 + k²

Expanding (k + 5)^2: k² + 10k + 25

So left side becomes 25 + k² + 10k + 25 = k² + 10k + 50

Set equal to right side: k² + 10k + 50 = 49 + k²

Subtract k² from both sides: 10k + 50 = 49 → 10k = -1 → k = -1/10.

Wait, so the center is at (0, -1/10)? Let me check with another point to confirm.

Take point C(0,-7). Distance squared from center (0, -1/10) to C(0,-7):

(0 - 0)^2 + (-7 - (-1/10))^2 = 0 + (-7 + 1/10)^2 = (-69/10)^2 = (69/10)^2 = 4761/100 = 47.61

Check with point A(-7,0): distance squared is (-7)^2 + (0 - (-1/10))² = 49 + (1/10)^2 = 49 + 0.01 = 49.01

Wait, but earlier calculation said that the distance squared from B to center was 25 + (k + 5)^2 where k=-1/10:

So k + 5 = -1/10 + 5 = 49/10. Then square is (49/10)^2 = 2401/100 = 24.01. Adding 25 gives 25 + 24.01 = 49.01. Which matches with point A's distance squared. But for point C, we had 47.61? That doesn't match. There's a contradiction here. So my assumption that the center is (0, -1/10) must be wrong.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when I took points A(-7,0) and E(7,0), their midpoint is (0,0). The perpendicular bisector is the y-axis, so center is on y-axis. Then taking point B(-5,-5), distance squared from center (0,k) to B(-5,-5) is (-5)^2 + (-5 - k)^2 = 25 + (k +5)^2.

Distance squared from center to A(-7,0) is (-7)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = 49 + k².

Setting them equal:

25 + (k +5)^2 = 49 + k².

Expand (k +5)^2: k² +10k +25. Thus:

25 + k² +10k +25 = 49 + k² → combine terms:

k² +10k +50 = k² +49 → subtract k²:

10k +50 = 49 → 10k = -1 → k= -1/10. So that seems correct. But then why does point C not satisfy?

Let me compute the distance from center (0, -1/10) to point C(0,-7):

The difference in y-coordinates is -7 - (-1/10) = -7 + 1/10 = -69/10. Squared is (69/10)^2 = 4761/100 = 47.61.

But the distance squared from center to A is 49 + (1/10)^2 = 49 + 0.01 = 49.01. Which is different from 47.61. So something's wrong here. That suggests that either my approach is incorrect, or perhaps the points do not lie on the same circle? But the problem says they are on a semicircle, which implies they are on a circle. So maybe I made an error in calculation?

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider more points. Let me check with point D(5,-5). Let's calculate distance squared from center (0, -1/10) to D(5,-5):

x-coordinate difference: 5 - 0 = 5, squared is 25. y-coordinate difference: -5 - (-1/10) = -5 + 1/10 = -49/10. Squared is (49/10)^2 = 2401/100 = 24.01. Total distance squared: 25 + 24.01 = 49.01, same as point A. So that works. But for point C(0,-7), it's giving 47.61. So inconsistency here. Hence, my previous conclusion is invalid. So perhaps my initial assumption that the center is on the y-axis is wrong?

Wait, how did I get that? Because points A and E are symmetric over the y-axis. So the perpendicular bisector of AE is the y-axis, hence the center must lie on the y-axis. Therefore, if the center is on y-axis, then the distances to A and E are same. However, the distance to C is not matching. Therefore, there's a contradiction. Which means either there's an error in calculation, or maybe the points are not lying on a circle? But the problem states they are on a semicircle. So there must be something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I misread the coordinates of point C? Let me check again. The user wrote:

Equals(C,(0,-7))

Yes, so point C is (0,-7). Let me recalculate the distance squared from center (0, -1/10) to C(0,-7):

Difference in y-coordinate: -7 - (-1/10) = -7 + 0.1 = -6.9. Square is (-6.9)^2 = 47.61. While for point A(-7,0), distance squared is (-7)^2 + (0 - (-1/10))^2 = 49 + 0.01 = 49.01. Which is larger than 47.61. Therefore, unless I made an error, this suggests that point C is not on the circle passing through A,B,D,E. Which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, my approach must have an error.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the semicircle is only part of the circle, so maybe the points are arranged such that the semicircle is only half of the circle, so the diameter is the line segment connecting two endpoints? For example, maybe points A and E are endpoints of the diameter, making the semicircle above or below?

Wait, if A(-7,0) and E(7,0) are endpoints of the diameter, then the center would be the midpoint of AE, which is (0,0). Then radius would be 7 units. Let me check if the other points lie on this circle. The equation of the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 7 is x² + y² = 49.

Check point B(-5,-5): (-5)^2 + (-5)^2 = 25 + 25 = 50 ≠ 49. Not on the circle. So that doesn't work.

What if the diameter isn't AE? Let me think. Alternatively, maybe the diameter is from A(-7,0) to C(0,-7)? Let's see. Midpoint would be (-3.5, -3.5). The radius would be half the distance between A and C. Let's compute distance AC: sqrt[ (0 - (-7))² + (-7 - 0)^2 ] = sqrt(49 + 49) = sqrt(98) ≈ 9.899. Radius would be ~4.949. Then checking point B(-5,-5): distance from midpoint (-3.5, -3.5) to B(-5,-5): sqrt[ (-5 +3.5)^2 + (-5 +3.5)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-1.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 ] = sqrt(2.25 + 2.25) = sqrt(4.5) ≈ 2.121, which is way less than radius. So that's not working.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to use another method. Let's consider that all five points lie on a circle. To find the center, I can set up equations using three points and solve.

Let me choose points A(-7,0), B(-5,-5), and C(0,-7).

General equation of a circle: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.

Plugging in A: (-7 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2 → (h +7)^2 + k² = r² ...(1)

Plugging in B: (-5 - h)^2 + (-5 - k)^2 = r² → (h +5)^2 + (k +5)^2 = r² ...(2)

Plugging in C: (0 - h)^2 + (-7 - k)^2 = r² → h² + (k +7)^2 = r² ...(3)

Now, subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

[(h +5)^2 + (k +5)^2] - [(h +7)^2 + k²] = 0

Expand each term:

(h² +10h +25) + (k² +10k +25) - [h² +14h +49 +k²] = 0

Simplify:

h² +10h +25 +k² +10k +25 -h² -14h -49 -k² = 0

Combine like terms:

(10h -14h) + (25 +25 -49) + (10k) = 0 → (-4h) + (1) +10k = 0 → -4h +10k +1 = 0 → 4h -10k = 1 ...(a)

Similarly, subtract equation (2) from equation (3):

[h² + (k +7)^2] - [(h +5)^2 + (k +5)^2] = 0

Expand:

h² + k² +14k +49 - [h² +10h +25 +k² +10k +25] = 0

Simplify:

h² +k² +14k +49 -h² -10h -25 -k² -10k -25 = 0

Combine terms:

(14k -10k) + (49 -25 -25) -10h = 0 → 4k + (0) -10h = 0 → -10h +4k = 0 → 10h -4k = 0 ...(b)

Now, we have two equations:

(a) 4h -10k = 1

(b) 10h -4k = 0

Let me solve this system. From equation (b): 10h = 4k → k = (10h)/4 = (5h)/2.

Plug into equation (a):

4h -10*(5h/2) = 1 → 4h -25h = 1 → -21h = 1 → h = -1/21.

Then, k = (5*(-1/21))/2 = (-5/21)/2 = -5/(42).

So center at (h, k) = (-1/21, -5/42). Let me verify if this satisfies the equations.

But before proceeding, let me check if this makes sense. Let me plug back into equation (b): 10h -4k = 10*(-1/21) -4*(-5/42) = -10/21 + 20/42 = -10/21 + 10/21 = 0. Correct.

Now, check equation (a): 4h -10k = 4*(-1/21) -10*(-5/42) = -4/21 + 50/42 = convert to common denominator:

-4/21 = -8/42, so total is -8/42 + 50/42 = 42/42 = 1. Correct.

So center is (-1/21, -5/42). Now, let's check if this center also satisfies point D(5,-5) and E(7,0). 

First, compute the radius squared using point A: (-7 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2.

h = -1/21, so -7 - h = -7 +1/21 = (-147 +1)/21 = -146/21. Squared: (146/21)^2.

Similarly, k = -5/42, so 0 - k = 5/42. Squared: (5/42)^2.

Thus, radius squared is (146²)/(21²) + (5²)/(42²). Let me compute this numerically.

But maybe instead of calculating directly, let's check point D(5,-5):

Distance squared from center to D(5,-5):

x: 5 - (-1/21) = 5 + 1/21 = 106/21.

y: -5 - (-5/42) = -5 + 5/42 = (-210 +5)/42 = -205/42.

So squared distance: (106/21)^2 + (-205/42)^2.

Let me compute this value and compare with radius squared from point A.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate whether these values are equal.

Alternatively, maybe there's a computational error. This seems complex. Let me try plugging numbers:

Compute h = -1/21 ≈ -0.0476, k = -5/42 ≈ -0.1190.

So center approximately at (-0.0476, -0.1190).

Check distance squared from center to point A(-7,0):

Δx = -7 - (-0.0476) = -6.9524, Δy = 0 - (-0.1190) = 0.1190.

Squared distance: (-6.9524)^2 + (0.1190)^2 ≈ 48.33 + 0.0142 ≈ 48.3442.

Check distance squared to point B(-5,-5):

Δx = -5 - (-0.0476) = -4.9524, Δy = -5 - (-0.1190) = -4.881.

Squared distance: (-4.9524)^2 + (-4.881)^2 ≈ 24.53 + 23.82 ≈ 48.35. Close enough considering rounding errors.

For point C(0,-7):

Δx = 0 - (-0.0476) = 0.0476, Δy = -7 - (-0.1190) = -6.881.

Squared distance: (0.0476)^2 + (-6.881)^2 ≈ 0.0023 + 47.34 ≈ 47.34. Wait, this is different from the previous 48.34. So discrepancy here. That suggests inconsistency. What's wrong?

Wait, this indicates that the center calculated from points A, B, C does not satisfy point C. Which shouldn't happen. Did I make a mistake in solving equations?

Wait, let me redo the equations. Earlier steps:

From points A, B, C, we derived:

Equation (a): 4h -10k = 1

Equation (b): 10h -4k = 0

Solving:

From (b): 10h = 4k ⇒ k = (10/4)h = (5/2)h.

Substitute into (a):

4h -10*(5/2 h) = 4h -25h = -21h = 1 ⇒ h = -1/21. Then k = (5/2)(-1/21) = -5/42. So that's correct.

So the center is (-1/21, -5/42). Let me check for point C(0,-7):

Distance squared from center to C: (0 + 1/21)^2 + (-7 + 5/42)^2.

Calculate:

First term: (1/21)^2 = 1/441 ≈ 0.00227.

Second term: -7 + 5/42 = -7 + 5/42 = -(7*42/42 - 5/42) = -(294 -5)/42 = -289/42 ≈ -6.88095...

Square of that is (289/42)^2. Let me compute 289² = 83521, 42²=1764. So 83521 / 1764 ≈ 47.34. Adding the first term gives approx 47.34 + 0.00227 ≈ 47.342. Whereas for point A, we had approx 48.34. So this suggests inconsistency. Which means that there's an error in the assumption that all five points lie on the same circle. But the problem states they are on a semicircle. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me check the original problem again. It says "the following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,-5), (0,7), (5,-5), (7,0)." Wait, hold on! In the problem description, one of the points is (0,7), but in the initial list, the user mentioned Equals(C,(0,-7)). Wait, perhaps there was a typo? Let me check.

Original input:

"PointLiesOnCircle(A,1)
PointLiesOnCircle(B,1)
PointLiesOnCircle(C,1)
PointLiesOnCircle(D,1)
PointLiesOnCircle(E,1)
Equals(A,(-7,0))
Equals(B,(-5,-5))
Equals(C,(0,-7))
Equals(D,(5,-5))
Equals(E,(7,0))"

Ah, so point C is (0,-7), not (0,7). So the problem statement might have a typo? Or maybe the user intended point C to be (0,7)? Because otherwise, the points don't form a circle. Let me assume that maybe there was a typo and point C is (0,7). Let me try that.

Assume that point C is (0,7). Let me redo the equations with points A(-7,0), B(-5,-5), C(0,7).

So general circle equation:

For point A: (-7-h)^2 + (0-k)^2 = r² → (h+7)^2 + k² = r² ... (1)

For point B: (-5-h)^2 + (-5 -k)^2 = r² ... (2)

For point C: (0-h)^2 + (7 -k)^2 = r² ... (3)

Subtract (1) from (2):

[(h+5)^2 + (k +5)^2] - [(h+7)^2 + k²] = 0

Expand:

(h² +10h +25) + (k² +10k +25) - [h² +14h +49 +k²] = 0

Simplify: 10h +25 +10k +25 -14h -49 = 0 → -4h +10k + (25+25-49)= -4h +10k +1 = 0 → 4h -10k = 1 ...(a)

Subtract (2) from (3):

[h² + (7 -k)^2] - [(h+5)^2 + (k +5)^2] = 0

Expand:

h² + (49 -14k +k²) - [h² +10h +25 +k² +10k +25] = 0

Simplify:

h² +49 -14k +k² -h² -10h -25 -k² -10k -25 = 0

Combine terms:

-10h -14k -10k + (49 -25 -25) = -10h -24k + 1 = 0 → 10h +24k = 1 ...(b)

Now, we have:

(a) 4h -10k = 1

(b) 10h +24k = 1

Let me solve this system.

Multiply equation (a) by 5: 20h -50k = 5

Multiply equation (b) by 2: 20h +48k = 2

Subtracting the new equation (b)*2 from (a)*5:

(20h -50k) - (20h +48k) = 5 - 2 → -98k = 3 → k = -3/98 = -3/98 ≈ -0.0306.

Then substitute back into (a): 4h -10*(-3/98) = 1 → 4h + 30/98 = 1 → 4h = 1 - 30/98 = (98/98 - 30/98) = 68/98 → h = (68/98)/4 = 68/(98*4) = 17/98 ≈ 0.1735.

So center at (17/98, -3/98). Let me simplify fractions:

17/98 can be reduced? 17 is prime, 98 = 14*7. No common factors. So h = 17/98, k = -3/98.

Now, check if this center works for point C(0,7):

Distance squared from center to C(0,7):

(0 - 17/98)^2 + (7 - (-3/98))^2 = (17/98)^2 + (7 + 3/98)^2.

Compute 7 + 3/98 = 686/98 + 3/98 = 689/98. Squared is (689/98)^2.

Also, for point A(-7,0):

Distance squared is (-7 - 17/98)^2 + (0 + 3/98)^2. Let's calculate:

-7 -17/98 = -7 - 0.1735 ≈ -7.1735. Squared is around 51.46.

But let me check with exact values.

Alternatively, let me check if this center also satisfies point D(5,-5) and E(7,0). But this is getting complicated. However, assuming that the problem may have had a typo, and point C should be (0,7), then this could be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the original points include (0,7), but in the initial data, it was mistyped as (0,-7). Let me check the original problem again.

Looking back, the user provided:

"PointLiesOnCircle(A,1)
PointLiesOnCircle(B,1)
PointLiesOnCircle(C,1)
PointLiesOnCircle(D,1)
PointLiesOnCircle(E,1)
Equals(A,(-7,0))
Equals(B,(-5,-5))
Equals(C,(0,-7))
Equals(D,(5,-5))
Equals(E,(7,0))"

So the points are indeed: A(-7,0), B(-5,-5), C(0,-7), D(5,-5), E(7,0). So point C is (0,-7). But then, as previously, the circle through A, B, C, D, E would not exist, since the calculations don't align. This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I need to consider that the semicircle is not part of a full circle, but rather a semicircle with diameter AB or something else.

Wait, let me try another approach. Suppose the semicircle is drawn with diameter AE, from (-7,0) to (7,0). Then the center would be at (0,0), and the semicircle would be the upper half or lower half. But the other points B(-5,-5), C(0,-7), D(5,-5) are below the x-axis. If the semicircle is the lower half, then the circle would have center at (0,0) and radius 7. But as checked earlier, point B(-5,-5) is at distance sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07, which is greater than 7, so it's outside the circle. Hence, not on the semicircle.

Alternatively, maybe the semicircle is not part of a full circle, but constructed differently. Or perhaps the points are on a semicircle with a different diameter.

Wait, let me consider that the semicircle is the lower half of a circle. Let me assume that the circle has center at (0, k), and the semicircle is the lower half. Let me try to find k such that all points are on the circle.

Using points A(-7,0), B(-5,-5), C(0,-7), D(5,-5), E(7,0). All these points should satisfy (x)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2.

For point A: (-7)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = 49 + k² = r².

For point B: (-5)^2 + (-5 - k)^2 = 25 + (k +5)^2 = r².

Set equal: 49 + k² = 25 + (k +5)^2.

Expand RHS: 25 + k² +10k +25 = k² +10k +50.

Set equal to LHS: 49 + k² = k² +10k +50 → 49 = 10k +50 → 10k = -1 → k = -1/10.

So center at (0, -1/10). Now check point C(0,-7):

Distance squared from center: (0)^2 + (-7 - (-1/10))^2 = (-7 + 1/10)^2 = (-69/10)^2 = 4761/100 = 47.61.

Radius squared from point A is 49 + (1/10)^2 = 49 + 0.01 = 49.01. So 47.61 ≠ 49.01. So point C is not on the circle. Hence, contradiction.

But the problem says all points are on the semicircle. So there must be an error in assumptions.

Wait, maybe the semicircle is not part of a full circle, but constructed with a different diameter? For example, if the semicircle is from B to D, with center somewhere else?

Alternatively, maybe the semicircle is part of a circle with diameter BC or something? Let me try with points B(-5,-5) and D(5,-5). Midpoint is (0,-5). The center would be (0,-5), radius would be 5 units. Check if other points are on this circle.

Circle equation: (x - 0)^2 + (y +5)^2 = 25.

Check point A(-7,0): (-7)^2 + (0 +5)^2 = 49 +25 = 74 ≠ 25. Nope.

Check point C(0,-7): (0)^2 + (-7 +5)^2 = 0 + 4 = 4 ≠ 25. No.

Not working. How about diameter from A(-7,0) to C(0,-7)? Midpoint is (-3.5, -3.5). Radius is half the distance between A and C. Distance AC: sqrt((7)^2 + (7)^2) = 7√2, so radius is (7√2)/2. Equation: (x +3.5)^2 + (y +3.5)^2 = (49*2)/4 = 49/2.

Check point B(-5,-5): (-5 +3.5)^2 + (-5 +3.5)^2 = (-1.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 = 2.25 + 2.25 = 4.5 = 9/2. But 9/2 is 4.5, while radius squared is 49/2 = 24.5. Not equal. So no.

This is really perplexing. Given the time I've spent without success, maybe I should revisit the original problem statement. The user mentioned that it's a semicircle passing through those points. Perhaps the semicircle is part of a circle, and the points are arranged such that they are on a semicircle, not necessarily all on the full circle. But how?

Wait, maybe the semicircle is drawn with diameter from A(-7,0) to E(7,0), and the points B, C, D are on the semicircle. Let me check if they lie on the lower semicircle.

The full circle would have center at (0,0), radius 7. The lower semicircle would be y ≤ 0. Points B(-5,-5), D(5,-5), and C(0,-7) are on the lower semicircle. Let me check if they lie on the circle:

For B(-5,-5): x² + y² = 25 + 25 = 50 > 49, so not on the circle. Hence, not on the semicircle. But the problem says they are on the semicircle. So this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, maybe the semicircle is part of a different circle. Let me try to find the circle passing through points B(-5,-5), C(0,-7), D(5,-5), and E(7,0). Let's use three points: B, C, D.

Points B(-5,-5), C(0,-7), D(5,-5).

Let me set up equations for the circle passing through these three points.

General equation: (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r².

For B: (-5 - h)^2 + (-5 - k)^2 = r² ...(1)

For C: (0 - h)^2 + (-7 - k)^2 = r² ...(2)

For D: (5 - h)^2 + (-5 - k)^2 = r² ...(3)

Subtract (1) from (3):

[(5 - h)^2 + (-5 - k)^2] - [(-5 - h)^2 + (-5 - k)^2] = 0

Simplify: (5 - h)^2 - (-5 - h)^2 = 0.

Expand both squares:

(25 -10h + h²) - (25 +10h + h²) = 25 -10h + h² -25 -10h - h² = -20h = 0 → h = 0.

So the x-coordinate of the center is 0. Now, with h = 0, let's use points B and C to find k.

From equation (1): (-5 - 0)^2 + (-5 - k)^2 = r² → 25 + (k +5)^2 = r² ...(1)

From equation (2): (0 - 0)^2 + (-7 - k)^2 = r² → (k +7)^2 = r² ...(2)

Set equal: 25 + (k +5)^2 = (k +7)^2

Expand: 25 + k² +10k +25 = k² +14k +49

Simplify: 25 +10k +25 = 14k +49 → 50 +10k = 14k +49 → 50 -49 = 14k -10k → 1 = 4k → k = 1/4.

So center at (0, 1/4). Let's verify with point D(5,-5):

Distance squared from center (0, 1/4) to D(5,-5): (5-0)^2 + (-5 - 1/4)^2 = 25 + (-21/4)^2

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $center at (0, 1/4). Let's verify with point D(5,-5):$
