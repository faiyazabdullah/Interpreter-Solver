QUESTION:

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the domain and range of each function using interval notation, given some points and a line. Wait, but the problem mentions a line going through a hollow point (2,8) and a solid point (8,6). Hmm, maybe they're talking about a linear function? Because if there's a line connecting those two points, then perhaps we need to find the equation of that line, and then determine its domain and range?

First, I need to parse the given predicates. Let me go through them again. 

The user mentioned several predicates like Point(A), Point(B), PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(A,B)), etc. But then there are also Equals(2,A), Equals(8,B), Equals(8,A), Equals(6,B). Then Points PointA and PointB with Equals(PointA, 2, 8) and Equals(PointB, 8, 6). And Line(PointA, PointB).

Wait, maybe these are coordinate points? Like PointA is at (2,8) and PointB is at (8,6)? That seems likely because the problem says "a line goes through a hollow point (2,8) and a solid point (8,6)". So the line passes through these two points. 

So, if I have two points, (2,8) and (8,6), then the line connecting them would have a certain slope. To find the equation of the line, I can calculate the slope first. The slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Plugging in the points: (6 - 8)/(8 - 2) = (-2)/6 = -1/3. So the slope is -1/3.

Then, using point-slope form, y - y1 = m(x - x1). Let's take PointA (2,8) as our reference. So the equation becomes y - 8 = (-1/3)(x - 2). Simplifying that, y = (-1/3)x + 2/3 + 8. Converting 8 to thirds, it's 24/3, so total is 26/3. Therefore, the equation of the line is y = (-1/3)x + 26/3.

Now, the question asks for the domain and range of each function. Wait, but the line itself isn't a function unless we consider it as a relation. However, since it's a straight line, technically, the domain is all real numbers because a line extends infinitely in both directions. Similarly, the range is also all real numbers. But wait, maybe the problem is referring to the line as a function? But a vertical line isn't a function, but this line has a slope of -1/3, so it's not vertical. So yes, it's a function. So the domain and range would be all real numbers. But the problem says "each function", implying there might be more than one function? Or maybe just this line?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering parametric equations or something else? Wait, no. The problem states "Write the domain and range of each function using interval notation." Since there's only one line given here, perhaps the function is the line itself. So the domain is all real numbers, and the range is also all real numbers. But in interval notation, that's (-∞, ∞) for both. But maybe the problem expects something different?

Wait, but maybe there's confusion here. If the line is part of a larger context where other functions are involved, but according to the given information, there's only the line passing through those two points. Unless there's another function implied? Maybe not. The problem mentions "each function," but without additional info, I think the only function here is the line defined by those two points. So the domain and range would be all real numbers.

But let me check again. The original problem says "the domain and range of each function". If there's only one function (the line), then both domain and range are all real numbers. But maybe the problem is expecting something else? Let me think again. Maybe the question is referring to the linear function represented by the line? In that case, yes, the domain is all real numbers, and the range is all real numbers.

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the setup? For example, if the line is considered as a function, then yes. But if it's a general line, then technically, it's not a function unless restricted. But since there's no restriction mentioned, the domain is still all real numbers. 

Therefore, the final answer should be domain and range both as (-∞, ∞). But I need to confirm if there's anything else. The problem mentions "hollow" and "solid" points—maybe those terms refer to something else? Like maybe the hollow point is not on the line? But the problem says the line goes through both points. So maybe the points are just labeled as hollow and solid for distinction, but they are both on the line. 

No, I think my initial thought is correct. The line passes through (2,8) and (8,6), so the function is y = -1/3 x + 26/3. Thus, domain is all real numbers, range same. So in interval notation, that's (-infty, infty) for both. 

But wait, sometimes people might consider the domain and range of a line segment between two points. But the problem doesn't mention a segment, just a line. So unless specified otherwise, the line is infinite. Hence, the domain and range are all real numbers. 

I think that's the conclusion here. So the answer is domain and range both being (-∞, ∞).

FINAL RESPONSE:

Final Answer: The domain and range of the function representing the line are both all real numbers, expressed in interval notation as $(-\infty, \infty)$.  
Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } (-\infty, \infty), \quad \text{Range: } (-\infty, \infty)$
