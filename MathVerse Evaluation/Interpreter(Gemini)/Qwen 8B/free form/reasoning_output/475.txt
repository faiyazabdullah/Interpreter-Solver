MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question says there's a point at 4, and a blue arrow goes to the left from that point. We need to write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation. 

First, I need to parse the given predicates. Let me recall the given predicates:

- Point(4): This probably means there's a point labeled 4 on the number line.
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(4), Line($1,$2)): This suggests that the point 4 lies on some line defined by two points, maybe the line connecting points 1 and 2? Wait, but the variables here are $1 and $2. Maybe those are placeholders for actual points?
Wait, the original problem mentions "a blue arrow goes to left from that point." So the blue arrow is a line segment starting at point 4 and going to the left. Since it's an arrow, perhaps it's indicating direction, so maybe it's a ray?

But the problem also mentions LengthOf(Line($3,$4)). Hmm, maybe these are parameters for lines. But since we're dealing with a number line, perhaps the line is the real number line itself. 

Let me think again. The main elements are:

1. There's a point at position 4 on the number line.
2. A blue arrow starts at this point and goes to the left. So the arrow is pointing towards decreasing numbers, i.e., negative direction from 4.
3. The question asks for the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation. Wait, does that mean the entire number line? Or something else? Maybe the blue arrow indicates a certain interval?

Wait, if the arrow is going to the left from point 4, maybe it's indicating that the blue line extends infinitely to the left from 4. So the blue arrow could represent a ray starting at 4 and going leftwards. Therefore, the set of numbers would be all real numbers less than or equal to 4? Because the arrow starts at 4 and goes left, so including 4 and everything to the left. But wait, arrows usually indicate direction. If it's an arrow pointing to the left, then it's a ray starting at 4 and extending infinitely to the left. So the interval would be (-∞, 4]. But wait, the problem says "the set of numbers represented on the number line". But how do we know the rest of the number line is included? Unless the blue arrow is the entire number line? No, because the blue arrow starts at 4 and goes left. Maybe the blue arrow is just part of the number line?

Alternatively, maybe the blue arrow is a segment from 4 to some other point. But the problem says "goes to left from that point," which implies it's a direction, not necessarily a finite length. However, without more information about where the arrow ends, how can we determine the interval?

Wait, the problem mentions "blue arrow goes to left from that point." In many contexts, an arrow on a number line might represent a directed line segment, but since it's called an arrow, maybe it's a ray. But in standard terms, a ray starts at a point and extends infinitely in one direction. So if the arrow is going to the left from point 4, then the ray starts at 4 and continues left indefinitely. Thus, the set of numbers would be all real numbers less than or equal to 4. Hence, the interval notation would be (-∞, 4].

But why does the problem mention the blue arrow? Is there more information? Let me check the given predicates again. The user mentioned Blue(Line($3,$4)), but I don't have specific info about what points 3 and 4 are. Wait, the initial point is 4, which is a point. Then the blue arrow is Line($3,$4). Wait, maybe the blue arrow is a line segment from point 3 to point 4? But point 4 is already given. If the blue arrow goes to the left from point 4, maybe point 3 is another point such that the line from 3 to 4 is horizontal (since it's a number line), and the arrow is pointing left, implying that 3 is to the left of 4. But without knowing where exactly, how can we determine the interval?

Alternatively, perhaps the blue arrow is a vector, indicating direction. But in the absence of more specific information, like the length of the arrow or specific coordinates, maybe the problem is simpler. The question is about the set of numbers on the number line. If the blue arrow starts at 4 and goes left, then the numbers on the number line would include all numbers from negative infinity up to 4. But why would the presence of the blue arrow affect the entire number line? Unless the blue arrow defines a particular interval. But without additional constraints, I'm confused.

Wait, maybe the blue arrow is indicating that the number line has been marked from 4 to the left, implying that the numbers represented are from negative infinity up to 4. But in standard problems, unless specified otherwise, the entire number line is considered. However, maybe the problem is referring to the portion covered by the blue arrow. But since the arrow is infinite, the interval would still be (-∞, 4].

Alternatively, maybe the blue arrow is a specific segment. Suppose the blue arrow is from point 4 to another point, say, point 3, which is to the left. But without knowing where point 3 is, we can't determine the exact interval. However, since the problem doesn't give specific coordinates for other points, maybe the answer is simply the interval starting at 4 and going to the left infinitely. 

Another thought: In some contexts, especially in coordinate geometry, a number line with a point at 4 and an arrow pointing left might imply that the numbers to the left of 4 are being considered. But again, without more constraints, the entire number line is still valid. However, if the arrow is indicating the direction, maybe the interval is from negative infinity up to 4. 

Since the problem asks for the set of numbers represented on the number line, and given that there's a point at 4 and a blue arrow going to the left, I think the intended answer is all real numbers less than or equal to 4. Hence, the interval notation would be (-∞, 4]. 

I should verify if there's any missing information. The problem states "Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation." If the blue arrow is the only mark, then the numbers represented would be from negative infinity up to 4. So yes, (-∞, 4].
