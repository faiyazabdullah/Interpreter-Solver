QUESTION:
The radius of the figure is $22.1\mathrm{~m}$. Calculate the area of the following sector.

Round your answer to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the area of a sector given some predicates. Let me start by understanding what's given.

First, the problem mentions a Sector(O, A, B). That means we have a sector of a circle with center O, and points A and B on the circumference. Then there's a measure of the angle at O, which is Angle(A, O, B) equals 74 degrees. Also, the lengths of OA and OB are both 22.1 meters. They also mention that OA and OB are radii of the circle centered at O. 

So, putting this together, we have a circle with center O, two radii OA and OB forming an angle of 74 degrees, creating a sector. The radius of the circle is given as 22.1 meters. The task is to calculate the area of this sector.

Now, I need to recall the formula for the area of a sector. From my geometry classes, I remember that the area of a sector is a fraction of the area of the entire circle, corresponding to the central angle. The formula is (θ/360) × πr², where θ is the central angle in degrees and r is the radius. Alternatively, if θ is in radians, it's (1/2)θr². Since the angle here is given in degrees (74°), I should use the first formula.

Let me confirm the formula again. Yes, for sectors, the area depends on the central angle. If the angle is θ degrees, then the area is (θ/360) multiplied by the area of the whole circle. So, substituting the values here, θ is 74°, radius is 22.1 m.

But wait, let me check if there are other ways to compute it. Maybe using the length of the arc? But since they ask for the area, not the arc length, the formula with θ over 360 seems correct.

So, plugging in the numbers: Area = (74/360) × π × (22.1)^2. Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the square of the radius: 22.1 squared. Let me do that. 22.1 times 22.1. Hmm, 22 squared is 484, 0.1 squared is 0.01, and cross terms. Wait, maybe better to compute directly:

22.1 × 22.1. Let me think. 22 × 22 is 484. Then, 22 × 0.1 is 2.2, 0.1 × 22 is another 2.2, and 0.1 × 0.1 is 0.01. So total would be 484 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 0.01 = 484 + 4.4 + 0.01 = 488.41. Wait, but actually, expanding (a + b)^2 where a=22, b=0.1: (22 + 0.1)^2 = 22² + 2*22*0.1 + 0.1² = 484 + 4.4 + 0.01 = 488.41. Yes, so 22.1² is 488.41.

Then multiply by π. Let me note that π is approximately 3.1416. So 488.41 × π ≈ 488.41 × 3.1416. But before multiplying, we also have to multiply by 74/360. Let me see if I can simplify fractions first.

Alternatively, perhaps compute the numerical value step by step. Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute 74 divided by 360. Let me calculate that. 74 ÷ 360. Well, dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 37/180. Which is approximately... Let me compute 37 divided by 180. Let me divide 37 by 180. Since 180 goes into 37 zero times, add decimal: 0. So 0. something. Multiply numerator and denominator by 10: 370 / 180 = 1.833...? Wait no, that's not helpful. Let me just compute 37 ÷ 180. Let me note that 1/5 is 0.2, 1/10 is 0.1, so 37/180 is roughly (approximate decimal). Let me compute 37 ÷ 180:

Well, 180 × 0.2 = 36. So 0.2 is 36/180, so 37/180 is 0.2 + 1/180 ≈ 0.2 + 0.005555... ≈ 0.205555...

So approx 0.205555...

Therefore, the area is approximately 0.205555... × π × 488.41.

Let me compute that. First, multiply 488.41 × π. Let me take π ≈ 3.1416.

So 488.41 × 3.1416. Let me compute that:

First, 488.41 × 3 = 1,465.23

Then, 488.41 × 0.1416. Let me compute that part.

Breaking down 0.1416 into 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016.

Compute 488.41 × 0.1 = 48.841

488.41 × 0.04 = 19.5364

488.41 × 0.0016 = ?

First, 488.41 × 0.001 = 0.48841, so ×1.6 is 0.48841 × 1.6 = approx 0.781456

Adding those three parts: 48.841 + 19.5364 = 68.3774 + 0.781456 ≈ 69.158856

So total of 488.41 × 3.1416 ≈ 1,465.23 + 69.158856 ≈ 1,534.388856

So approximately 1,534.39 m²?

Wait, but that's the product of π × r². Then multiply by 0.205555...

So now, multiply 1,534.39 × 0.205555...

Let me compute that. Let me approximate 0.205555 as 0.205555...

Let me consider that 0.2 × 1,534.39 = 306.878

Then, 0.005555... × 1,534.39. Let me compute 0.005555... is 1/180, because 0.005555... is 1/180 ≈ 0.005555...

Wait, earlier we had 74/360 = 37/180 ≈ 0.205555..., so the remaining after subtracting 0.2 is 0.005555... which is 1/180. Therefore, the total multiplier is 0.2 + 1/180. So the total area is 0.2 × πr² + (1/180) × πr². Wait, but maybe easier to compute 0.205555... × πr².

Alternatively, since 0.205555... is 74/360, so the exact calculation would be (74/360) × π × r². However, since we already computed πr² as approx 1,534.39, then multiplying by 74/360 gives us the area.

But maybe instead of breaking it down like that, let me compute 74 × 488.41 first, then divide by 360, then multiply by π?

Wait, let me re-express the formula:

Area = (θ/360) × πr² = (74 × π × 22.1²)/360

Which is equivalent to (74 × π × 488.41)/360.

So compute 74 × 488.41 first.

Let me compute 74 × 488.41.

Hmm, that's going to be a big number. Let me break it down.

First, note that 70 × 488.41 = 70 × 488.41.

Compute 70 × 488.41:

Well, 70 × 400 = 28,000

70 × 88.41 = ?

Wait, maybe better to compute 488.41 × 70:

Breakdown:

488.41 × 70 = 488.41 × 7 × 10

Compute 488.41 × 7:

Calculate 400 × 7 = 2800

80 × 7 = 560

8.41 × 7 = 58.87

Total: 2800 + 560 = 3360 + 58.87 = 3418.87

Multiply by 10: 34,188.7

Then, 4 × 488.41 = 1,953.64

So total of 74 × 488.41 = 70×488.41 + 4×488.41 = 34,188.7 + 1,953.64 = 36,142.34

So 74 × 488.41 = 36,142.34

Then divide by 360:

36,142.34 / 360 ≈ Let me compute that division.

Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 18,071.17 / 180 ≈ 

Now, divide 18,071.17 by 180. Let me see how many times 180 fits into that.

180 × 100 = 18,000

Subtract 18,000 from 18,071.17: remainder is 71.17

So total is 100 + (71.17 / 180)

Compute 71.17 / 180 ≈ 0.395...

So total is approximately 100.395...

Thus, the value is approximately 100.395...

Then, multiply by π to get the area?

Wait, no! Wait, earlier steps were:

Area = (74 × π × 22.1²)/360, which was broken down as (74 × 488.41 × π)/360. So we found that 74 × 488.41 = 36,142.34. Then divide by 360, giving approx 100.395..., then multiply by π?

No, wait, no! Because π was already factored into the previous steps? Wait no. Let me backtrack.

Earlier, I calculated π × r² as approx 1,534.39, then multiplied by 74/360. But that's not accurate because I had separated π into separate steps. Actually, the correct way is:

Area = (θ/360) × πr² = (74/360) × π × (22.1)^2.

So, in order to compute that, I need to compute (74 × π × 22.1²)/360. So earlier steps where I calculated π × r² as ~1,534.39, then multiplied by 74/360 would be correct. But earlier, I thought that 74 × 488.41 / 360 × π? No, sorry, that's confusing.

Let me redo that. Let me compute (74 × π × 488.41)/360.

We have 74 × 488.41 = 36,142.34 as before.

Then divide that by 360: 36,142.34 / 360 ≈ 100.395...

Then multiply by π? Wait no, because π was already included in the multiplication. Wait, no. Wait, no. Let me clarify:

Original formula: Area = (θ/360) × πr². So θ is 74 degrees, r is 22.1.

So, Area = (74/360) × π × (22.1)^2.

So, the computation is:

First, compute (74/360) × (22.1)^2 × π.

So, (74/360) × 488.41 × π.

So, first compute 74/360 × 488.41. Which we did as approximately 100.395...

Then multiply by π.

So, 100.395... × π ≈ ?

π is approximately 3.1416. So 100.395 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Let me compute that:

First, 100 × 3.1416 = 314.16

Then, 0.395 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Compute 0.3 × 3.1416 = 0.94248

0.09 × 3.1416 = 0.282744

0.005 × 3.1416 = 0.015708

Add them up: 0.94248 + 0.282744 = 1.225224 + 0.015708 ≈ 1.240932

So total area ≈ 314.16 + 1.240932 ≈ 315.400932 m².

So approximately 315.4 m².

But wait, let me verify these calculations again because rounding errors could accumulate.

Alternative approach: Let me use calculator-like steps with more precise intermediate values.

First, compute r²: 22.1^2 = 488.41 (exact).

Then compute θ/360 = 74/360 ≈ 0.2055555556.

Multiply that by π × r²:

So, 0.2055555556 × π × 488.41.

Let me compute π × 488.41 first:

π × 488.41 ≈ 3.14159265 × 488.41.

Let me compute that:

First, 488.41 × 3 = 1,465.23

488.41 × 0.14159265 ≈ ?

Compute 488.41 × 0.1 = 48.841

488.41 × 0.04 = 19.5364

488.41 × 0.00159265 ≈ ?

Approximating 0.00159265 ≈ 0.0016.

So 488.41 × 0.0016 ≈ 0.781456

Adding up: 48.841 + 19.5364 = 68.3774 + 0.781456 ≈ 69.158856

So total π × r² ≈ 1,465.23 + 69.158856 ≈ 1,534.388856

Then multiply by 0.2055555556:

So 1,534.388856 × 0.2055555556 ≈ ?

Let me compute this:

First, note that 0.2 × 1,534.388856 = 306.8777712

Then, 0.0055555556 × 1,534.388856 ≈ ?

Since 0.0055555556 is approximately 1/180 ≈ 0.005555555...

So 1,534.388856 / 180 ≈ ?

Dividing 1,534.388856 by 180:

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 153.4388856 / 18 ≈ 

Divide 153.4388856 by 18:

18 × 8 = 144 → 153.438... - 144 = 9.438...

So 8 + 9.438... / 18 ≈ 8 + 0.5243 ≈ 8.5243

So total of 0.2 × ... plus 0.005555... × ... is 306.8777712 + 8.5243 ≈ 315.40207...

So total area ≈ 315.402 m².

Rounded to one decimal place, that would be 315.4 m².

Wait, but let me check once more for accuracy. Maybe I made a mistake in the approximation steps. Let me try another method.

Alternatively, use decimal multiplication:

Let me calculate the exact value of 74 × 488.41 / 360 × π.

But perhaps using calculator input:

If I have access to a calculator, but since I'm doing it manually, let me try to find a better way.

Another idea: Since 74/360 simplifies to 37/180, so the area is (37/180) × π × 22.1².

Calculating 37 × 22.1² / 180 × π.

Compute 22.1² = 488.41.

So 37 × 488.41 = ?

Let me compute 37 × 488.41:

Break it down as (30 + 7) × 488.41 = 30×488.41 + 7×488.41.

Compute 30×488.41 = 14,652.3

Compute 7×488.41 = 3,418.87

Total = 14,652.3 + 3,418.87 = 18,071.17

Then divide by 180: 18,071.17 / 180 ≈ 100.3953889...

Multiply by π: 100.3953889 × π ≈ ?

As before, π ≈ 3.14159265.

So 100.3953889 × 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Let me compute 100 × π = 314.159265

Then 0.3953889 × π ≈ ?

Compute 0.3953889 × 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Well, 0.4 × π ≈ 1.256637, subtract 0.0046111 × π ≈ 0.01447.

So approx 1.256637 - 0.01447 ≈ 1.242167.

So total area ≈ 314.159265 + 1.242167 ≈ 315.401432 m².

So approximately 315.4 m² when rounded to one decimal place.

Therefore, the area of the sector is approximately 315.4 square meters.

But let me check if there's any chance I messed up the formula. Another way: sometimes people confuse the formula with radians. But the angle is given in degrees, so the formula is definitely (θ/360)*πr².

Yes, that's correct. If the angle were in radians, it would be (1/2)θr². But since it's 74 degrees, the degree-based formula applies.

Another sanity check: the area of the full circle is π*(22.1)^2 ≈ 3.1416*488.41 ≈ 1,534.39 m². The sector is 74/360 of that. 74/360 is roughly 0.2055, so 0.2055 * 1,534.39 ≈ 315.4 m². Which matches our prior result. So that seems consistent.

Hence, the answer should be 315.4 m² when rounded to one decimal place.
