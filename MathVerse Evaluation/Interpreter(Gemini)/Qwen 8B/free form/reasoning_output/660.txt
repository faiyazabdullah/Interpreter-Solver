QUESTION:
A cylinder has a surface area of 54105(mm)^2 and a radius of 79 mm.

What must the height $h$ mm of the cylinder be?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the height h of a cylinder given its surface area and radius. Let me start by recalling the formula for the surface area of a cylinder. Hmm, I think the total surface area includes both the top and bottom circles plus the side. Wait, right, the formula is 2πr² + 2πrh. That's because the two circular bases each have an area of πr², so combined they're 2πr², and the lateral surface area is the circumference times the height, which is 2πr multiplied by h.

Given that the radius r is 79 mm and the total surface area is 54105 mm². So I can plug these values into the formula and solve for h. Let me write that down:

Total Surface Area (SA) = 2πr² + 2πrh

Plugging in the known values:

54105 = 2π(79)² + 2π(79)h

First, let me calculate 2πr². Let me compute 79 squared first. 79*79... 70² is 4900, 9² is 81, and cross terms 2*70*9=1260. So (70+9)² = 70² + 2*70*9 + 9² = 4900 + 1260 + 81 = 6241. So 79² is 6241. Then multiply by 2π: 2π*6241. Let me compute that numerically. 

But maybe I should keep it symbolic for now. Let me rearrange the equation to solve for h. Subtract 2πr² from both sides:

54105 - 2πr² = 2πrh

Then divide both sides by 2πr:

h = (54105 - 2πr²) / (2πr)

Alternatively, factor out 2πr from the original SA formula:

SA = 2πr(r + h). Wait, no, that would be if you factor 2πr from 2πr² + 2πrh, which is 2πr(r + h). But wait, that doesn't seem correct. Wait, let me check:

Original SA is 2πr² + 2πrh. Factor out 2πr? No, factoring 2πr would leave r + h, but actually:

Wait, 2πr² + 2πrh = 2πr(r) + 2πr(h) = 2πr(r + h). Yes! So SA = 2πr(r + h). Therefore, solving for h:

SA = 2πr(r + h) => divide both sides by 2πr:

SA/(2πr) = r + h

Therefore, h = SA/(2πr) - r

That seems simpler. Let me verify this algebra. Starting from SA = 2πr² + 2πrh, subtract 2πr²: SA - 2πr² = 2πrh. Then divide by 2πr: h = (SA - 2πr²)/(2πr). Which is equivalent to SA/(2πr) - r. Yep, same thing. Either way works.

So plugging numbers in:

First compute SA/(2πr):

SA is 54105, r is 79. Let me compute that division.

But before I proceed with numbers, maybe I can compute it step by step. Alternatively, since I know the numerical values, let me calculate each part.

Let me compute 2πr² first. As earlier, r² is 6241, so 2π*6241 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 6241. Let me compute 2 * 6241 = 12482. Multiply by π ≈ 3.1416. Let me approximate that. 12482 * π. Let me compute 12482 * 3.1416. Let me see:

Well, 12482 * 3 = 37446

12482 * 0.1416 ≈ ?

First, 12482 * 0.1 = 1248.2

12482 * 0.04 = 499.28

12482 * 0.0016 = approx 19.9712

Adding those together: 1248.2 + 499.28 = 1747.48 + 19.97 ≈ 1767.45

So total 12482 * π ≈ 37446 + 1767.45 ≈ 39213.45. Let me check with calculator steps. Wait, perhaps my approximation is off. Alternatively, maybe I should just do precise calculation with decimals.

Alternatively, maybe I can use more accurate methods. However, since I'm supposed to compute h, maybe I should use exact expressions first and then compute numerically.

But given that the problem says to round to the nearest whole number, perhaps I can carry out the computation step by step with decimals.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula h = (SA - 2πr²)/(2πr). Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Compute numerator: SA - 2πr² = 54105 - 2π*(79)^2

We already found that 79² is 6241, so 2π*6241 ≈ 2 * 3.1415926535 * 6241. Let me compute that precisely:

First, compute 2 * 6241 = 12482.

Multiply by π: 12482 * π ≈ 12482 * 3.1415926535.

Let me compute this multiplication. Let me note that π ≈ 3.1415926535.

So 12482 * π ≈ ?

Well, 12482 * 3 = 37446

12482 * 0.1415926535 ≈ ?

Let me break it down:

First, 12482 * 0.1 = 1248.2

12482 * 0.04 = 499.28

12482 * 0.0015926535 ≈ ?

Approximate 0.0015926535 as approximately 0.0016.

So 12482 * 0.0016 = 19.9712

So adding up:

1248.2 + 499.28 = 1747.48 + 19.9712 ≈ 1767.4512

So total π*12482 ≈ 37446 + 1767.4512 ≈ 39213.4512

Thus, the numerator is 54105 - 39213.4512 ≈ 54105 - 39213.45 = 14891.55

Now compute denominator: 2πr = 2π*79 ≈ 2 * 3.1415926535 * 79

Calculate 2 * 79 = 158.

Multiply by π: 158 * π ≈ 158 * 3.1415926535 ≈ ?

Again, 150 * π ≈ 471.2389, and 8 * π ≈ 25.1327. Total ≈ 471.2389 + 25.1327 ≈ 496.3716

So denominator ≈ 496.3716

Thus, h ≈ 14891.55 / 496.3716 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division.

Divide 14891.55 ÷ 496.3716.

First estimate how many times 496 goes into 14891. Let me compute 496 * 30 = 14,880. So 496 * 30 = 14,880. Which is very close to 14,891.55. So 30 times gives 14,880, and the difference is 14891.55 - 14880 = 11.55. So 11.55 / 496.3716 ≈ ~0.023. Thus total h ≈ 30.023. So approximately 30.02 mm.

Wait, but that seems low? Let me check again. Because if the surface area is 54105, and radius is 79 mm, which is quite large. Maybe my calculation is wrong. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, the surface area formula: SA = 2πr² + 2πrh. Given SA = 54105, r = 79. So substituting, we get 54105 = 2π(79)^2 + 2π(79)h. Let me check the calculation of 2πr² again.

Earlier, I computed 2πr² as approx 39213.45. Then 54105 minus that is 54105 - 39213.45 = 14891.55. Then divided by 2πr which was approx 496.37. So 14891.55 / 496.37 ≈ 30.02. So h ≈ 30.02 mm. Rounding to the nearest whole number is 30 mm. But let me confirm with more accurate calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I made an error in calculating 2πr². Let me recalculate 2πr² where r=79.

r² = 79² = 6241. Correct.

2πr² = 2 * π * 6241. Let me compute that with more precision. Let me take π as 3.1415926535.

So 2 * π * 6241 = 2 * 6241 * π = 12482 * π. Now, π ≈ 3.1415926535. So multiplying:

Let me compute 12482 * π. Let me use calculator-like steps. Well, 12482 * π ≈ ?

Using a calculator (pretending I can do this accurately), but since I don't have one here, let me try another way. Let me consider that π ≈ 22/7 ≈ 3.142857, but that's not super accurate. Alternatively, use more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that π ≈ 3.1415926535.

So 12482 × 3.1415926535.

Breakdown:

First, 12482 × 3 = 37446.

Then, 12482 × 0.1415926535.

To compute 0.1415926535 × 12482:

Let me write 0.1415926535 as approximately 0.14159265.

So compute 12482 × 0.14159265.

Let me split this into 12482 × 0.1 + 12482 × 0.04 + 12482 × 0.00159265.

As before:

12482 × 0.1 = 1248.2

12482 × 0.04 = 499.28

12482 × 0.00159265 ≈ ?

Well, 0.00159265 × 12482 ≈ 12482 × 0.0016 = 19.9712, but slightly less since 0.00159265 is 0.0016 - 0.00000735. So subtract 12482 × 0.00000735 ≈ 12482 × 7.35e-6 ≈ approx 12482 * 0.00000735 ≈ 0.0916.

So approx 19.9712 - 0.0916 ≈ 19.8796.

So total of the three parts: 1248.2 + 499.28 = 1747.48 + 19.8796 ≈ 1767.3596.

Thus, total 12482 × π ≈ 37446 + 1767.3596 ≈ 39213.3596.

So the numerator is 54105 - 39213.3596 ≈ 14891.6404.

Denominator is 2πr = 2π×79 = 158π ≈ 158 × 3.1415926535 ≈ ?

Let me compute 158 × π. Again, breaking down:

150 × π ≈ 471.2389

8 × π ≈ 25.1327

Total ≈ 471.2389 + 25.1327 ≈ 496.3716

So denominator ≈ 496.3716.

So h ≈ 14891.6404 / 496.3716 ≈ ?

Let me perform this division more carefully. Let me write 14891.6404 ÷ 496.3716.

First, note that 496.3716 × 30 = 14,891.148. Which is extremely close to 14891.6404. So 30 times gives 14,891.148. The difference between numerator and this is 14891.6404 - 14891.148 = 0.4924.

So then, 0.4924 / 496.3716 ≈ 0.000992. So total h ≈ 30 + 0.000992 ≈ 30.000992. So approximately 30.001 mm. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 30 mm.

But wait, this suggests h ≈ 30 mm. However, let me check once more with more precise calculations. Perhaps there was some rounding errors in intermediate steps?

Alternatively, maybe I should use exact fractions. Let me attempt to compute using more precise decimal expansions.

Alternatively, use calculator-like computations. Suppose I have access to exact decimal values. Let me recompute 2πr² and 2πr with higher precision.

But since I'm doing this manually, let me try another approach. Let me use the exact formula:

h = (SA - 2πr²)/(2πr)

Plug in the numbers:

SA = 54105, r = 79.

So,

Numerator: 54105 - 2π*(79)^2

Denominator: 2π*79

So h = [54105 - 2π*6241]/[2π*79]

Let me compute 2π*6241 = 12482π

Similarly, 2π*79 = 158π

So h = [54105 - 12482π]/(158π)

This can also be written as h = 54105/(158π) - 12482π/(158π) = 54105/(158π) - 12482/158

Simplify 12482/158: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 6241/79. Since 79*79=6241, so 6241/79 = 79. Hence, the second term is 79.

Therefore, h = 54105/(158π) - 79

So compute 54105/(158π) - 79.

Let me compute 54105 divided by 158π.

First, compute 54105 / 158 ≈ ?

Let me divide 54105 by 158. Let me compute:

158 × 300 = 47,400

Subtract that from 54,105: 54,105 - 47,400 = 6,705

Now, 158 × 42 = 158 × 40 + 158 × 2 = 6,320 + 316 = 6,636

Subtract that from 6,705: 6,705 - 6,636 = 69

So total is 300 + 42 = 342, with remainder 69. So 54105 / 158 ≈ 342 + 69/158 ≈ 342 + 0.4367 ≈ 342.4367.

So 54105 / 158 ≈ 342.4367. Then divide by π:

So 342.4367 / π ≈ 342.4367 / 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Compute that. Let me recall that π ≈ 3.1416.

So 342.4367 / 3.1416 ≈ ?

Well, 3.1416 × 100 = 314.16

3.1416 × 109 = 3.1416 × 100 + 3.1416 × 9 = 314.16 + 28.2744 = 342.4344

Wow! That's very close to our numerator of 342.4367. So 3.1416 × 109 ≈ 342.4344, which is nearly equal to 342.4367. The difference is 342.4367 - 342.4344 = 0.0023. So the value is approximately 109 + 0.0023 / 3.1416 ≈ 109 + 0.00073 ≈ 109.00073.

So 54105/(158π) ≈ 109.00073

Then subtract 79: h ≈ 109.00073 - 79 = 30.00073 mm.

So h ≈ 30.00073 mm. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 30 mm. So the height is approximately 30 mm.

But let me check with more precise calculation for confirmation. If 3.1416 × 109 = 342.4344, and our value is 342.4367, which is 0.0023 larger. To find how much more than 109, we can do:

Let x = 109 + δ such that 3.1416 × x = 342.4367.

We know that at x=109, 3.1416*x=342.4344. We need to find δ such that:

3.1416*(109 + δ) = 342.4367

Which implies:

3.1416*δ = 342.4367 - 342.4344 = 0.0023

Thus, δ = 0.0023 / 3.1416 ≈ 0.000732.

Hence, x ≈ 109.000732. Therefore, 54105/(158π) ≈ 109.000732, so h ≈ 109.000732 - 79 = 30.000732 mm. So indeed, h ≈ 30.0007 mm, which rounds to 30 mm.

Therefore, the height h is approximately 30 mm when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Wait, but let me double-check with another method. Suppose I use more accurate value of π. Let me take π as 3.1415926535.

So let me compute 54105 / (158 * π).

First compute 158 * π: 158 * 3.1415926535.

Let me compute 158 * 3.1415926535:

First, compute 100 * π = 314.15926535

Then 50 * π = 157.07963267

Then 8 * π = 25.132741228

Add them together: 314.15926535 + 157.07963267 = 471.23889802 + 25.132741228 ≈ 496.37163925

So 158π ≈ 496.37163925

Then 54105 / 496.37163925 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division. Let me do long division.

Dividing 54105 by 496.37163925.

First, approximate how many times 496.37 fits into 54105.

Since 496.37 * 100 = 49637.

So 496.37 * 100 = 49,637.

Subtract that from 54,105: 54,105 - 49,637 = 4,468.

Bring down decimal places (but since it's integer division, we can continue).

Now, 496.37 * 9 = 4,467.33.

So 496.37 * 9 ≈ 4,467.33, which is almost 4,468. So total multiplier is 100 + 9 = 109, with a small remainder.

So 496.37 * 109 = 496.37 * 100 + 496.37 * 9 = 49,637 + 4,467.33 = 54,104.33.

Compare with 54,105. The difference is 54,105 - 54,104.33 = 0.67.

So the value is 109 + 0.67 / 496.37 ≈ 109 + 0.00135 ≈ 109.00135.

Therefore, 54105 / (158π) ≈ 109.00135. Then subtract 79 gives h ≈ 109.00135 - 79 = 30.00135 mm. So approximately 30.00135 mm, which rounds to 30 mm. So this confirms the previous result.

Thus, the height h is approximately 30 mm when rounded to the nearest whole number.

I think this is solid. All methods lead to around 30.001 mm, so 30 mm is the correct answer.
