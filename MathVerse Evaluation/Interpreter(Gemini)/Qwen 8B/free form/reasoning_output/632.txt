QUESTION:
The Cosine function is graphed. It passes through (0,1), (90,0), (180,-1), (270,0), and (360,1). It is symmetric about the y-axis. A black vertex labeled on the function at (0,1). Consider the graph of y=\cos x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(0^\circ ,1\right).

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.
y=\cos \left(x+45^\circ \right)

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the first maximum point of the function y = cos(x + 45°) for x ≥ 0. Let me start by recalling some basics about cosine functions and their transformations.

First, the standard cosine function y = cos(x) has its maximum points at x = 0°, 360°, 720°, etc., because cosine starts at 1 when x=0, goes down to -1 at 180°, back up to 1 at 360°, and so on. So the maximum occurs every 360°, but since we're looking for the first maximum after x ≥ 0, it's at (0°, 1).

Now, the given function is y = cos(x + 45°). This looks like a horizontal shift of the original cosine function. The general form for a horizontally shifted cosine function is y = cos(Bx - C) + D, where the phase shift is C/B. But in our case, the equation is y = cos(x + 45°), which can be written as y = cos(x - (-45°)). Comparing to the general form, B is 1 here, so the phase shift is -45°, meaning the graph shifts to the left by 45°.

Wait, let me make sure. If you have y = cos(x + 45°), that's equivalent to y = cos(x - (-45°)), so the phase shift is -(-45°)/B = 45°? Wait, no. Let me recall the formula again. The phase shift is calculated as C/B when the function is y = A*cos(B(x - C)) + D. So if we have y = cos(x + 45°), that can be rewritten as y = cos(1*(x - (-45°))). Therefore, the phase shift is -45°, meaning the graph shifts to the left by 45°. 

So shifting the original cosine graph left by 45°. That means all the points on the original graph move 45° to the left. Therefore, the maximum points of the original function, which were at x = 0°, 360°, etc., would now be at x = -45°, 360° - 45° = 315°, etc. But we need the first maximum for x ≥ 0. 

So the original maxima at x = 0° shifted left by 45° would be at x = -45°, which is not in the domain x ≥ 0. Then the next maximum would be the original maximum at x = 360° shifted left by 45°, giving x = 360° - 45° = 315°. But wait, maybe there's another maximum between -45° and 315°? Wait, the cosine function has period 360°, so after shifting, the function repeats every 360°. So the first maximum after x ≥ 0 would be at x = 315°, since the previous one was at x=-45°, which is negative. 

But let me verify this. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when the argument of the cosine is 0°, because cos(θ) reaches maximum at θ = 0°. So set x + 45° = 0°, solving for x gives x = -45°, which again is negative. So the next time the argument is 0° would be when x + 45° = 360°, leading to x = 360° - 45° = 315°. Hence, the first maximum point for x ≥ 0 is at x = 315°, y = 1. 

Therefore, the coordinates would be (315°, 1). Let me check if this makes sense. For example, when x = 315°, plugging into the function: cos(315° + 45°) = cos(360°) = 1, which is correct. Also, between x=0° and x=315°, does the function reach a maximum? Let's think. The function y = cos(x + 45°) is just the standard cosine curve shifted left by 45°, so it should still have maxima every 360°, but shifted. So the first maximum after x ≥ 0 would indeed be at x = 315°, as previously determined. 

Another way to think about it: the maximum of cos(θ) occurs when θ = 0° + 360°k, k integer. Here, θ = x + 45°, so setting θ = 0° gives x = -45°, which is invalid. Next, θ = 360°, so x + 45° = 360° ⇒ x = 315°, which is valid. Thus, the first maximum is at (315°, 1).
