MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is asking for the equation of the line that passes through the points A(-2, -6) and B(2, -3). Hmm, right. Let me recall how to find the equation of a line given two points.

First, I think I need to find the slope of the line. The formula for slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Let me plug in the coordinates here. 

So point A is (-2, -6), so x1 is -2 and y1 is -6. Point B is (2, -3), so x2 is 2 and y2 is -3. Calculating the numerator: y2 - y1 is (-3) - (-6) which equals -3 + 6 = 3. Then denominator is x2 - x1, which is 2 - (-2) = 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, the slope m is 3/4. Wait, that seems straightforward. 

Now that I have the slope, I can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The point-slope formula is y - y1 = m(x - x1). I can use either point A or B. Maybe I'll pick point B because the numbers are smaller? Let me check. Using point B (2, -3): y - (-3) = (3/4)(x - 2). Simplifying that gives y + 3 = (3/4)x - (3/4)*2. Which is y + 3 = (3/4)x - 3/2. Then subtract 3 from both sides: y = (3/4)x - 3/2 - 3. Converting 3 to halves: 3 is 6/2, so -3/2 - 6/2 = -9/2. So the equation would be y = (3/4)x - 9/2. 

Wait, but maybe I should verify this with another method. Alternatively, using point A. Let's try that. Using point A (-2, -6): y - (-6) = (3/4)(x - (-2)) → y + 6 = (3/4)(x + 2). Expanding that gives y + 6 = (3/4)x + (3/4)*2 → y + 6 = (3/4)x + 3/2. Subtract 6: y = (3/4)x + 3/2 - 6. Convert 6 to halves again: 6 is 12/2, so 3/2 - 12/2 is -9/2. Same result. So that checks out. 

Alternatively, maybe convert it to standard form Ax + By = C. Starting from y = (3/4)x - 9/2. Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate fractions: 4y = 3x - 18. Rearranging terms: -3x + 4y = -18. Multiply both sides by -1: 3x - 4y = 18. That could also be written as 3x - 4y - 18 = 0. But the question says "Write an equation that represents the line." It doesn't specify the form, so slope-intercept is acceptable. However, sometimes standard form is preferred. Let me see if there's a way to present it neatly. 

But let me check if my calculation was correct. Another way: Let's confirm if both points satisfy the equation. Take point A (-2, -6). Plugging into y = (3/4)x - 9/2: Left side y is -6. Right side: (3/4)*(-2) - 9/2 = -3/2 - 9/2 = -12/2 = -6. Correct. Now point B (2, -3): Right side: (3/4)*2 - 9/2 = 3/2 - 9/2 = -6/2 = -3. Correct. So yes, the equation works. 

Therefore, the equation of the line is y = (3/4)x - 9/2. Alternatively, if they prefer integers, multiplying by 4 gives 4y = 3x - 18, so 3x - 4y = 18. Either form is correct. The question says "exact numbers," so fractional coefficients are okay. Slope-intercept form is probably the most direct answer here. 

I think that's all. Let me make sure there's no mistake in calculating the slope. Points A(-2,-6) and B(2,-3). Rise over run: (-3 - (-6))/(2 - (-2)) = (3)/4. Yes, correct. So slope is indeed 3/4. Then intercept calculation is correct. So the equation is correct.
