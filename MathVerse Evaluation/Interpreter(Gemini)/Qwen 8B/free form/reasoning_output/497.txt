QUESTION:
There is a linear function with a y-intercept of 3 and a x-intercept of 2. Determine the function expression of f shown in the figure.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding the linear function f that has a y-intercept of 3 and an x-intercept of 2. Hmm, linear functions... I remember they're straight lines, right? And the general form is something like f(x) = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Wait, the problem says the y-intercept is 3, so that means b = 3. That part seems straightforward.

But we also have an x-intercept of 2. The x-intercept is where the line crosses the x-axis, which happens when y = 0. So if I plug in x = 2 into the equation, the output should be 0. Let me write that down. If the point (2, 0) is on the line, then substituting x=2 gives 0 = m*2 + b. Since we already know b is 3, that becomes 0 = 2m + 3. Solving for m would give m = -3/2. 

Wait, let me check that again. If the x-intercept is 2, then the point (2, 0) lies on the line. Using the equation f(x) = mx + b, plugging in x=2 and y=0 gives 0 = m*2 + b. We know b is 3, so 0 = 2m + 3 → 2m = -3 → m = -3/2. Yeah, that seems right. So the slope is -3/2 and the y-intercept is 3. Therefore, the equation should be f(x) = (-3/2)x + 3. 

Let me verify if this works. When x=0, f(0) = 3, which matches the y-intercept. For the x-intercept, set f(x)=0: 0 = (-3/2)x + 3 → (-3/2)x = -3 → x = (-3)/(-3/2) = 2. Yep, that checks out. So the function is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it using the two points given. The problem mentions points A and B with coordinates (0,3) and (2,0). So those are the intercepts. Then the line AB connects these two points. The slope between A(0,3) and B(2,0) is (0-3)/(2-0) = -3/2, same as before. So the equation of the line is indeed y = -3/2 x + 3. 

So putting it all together, the function f(x) is -3/2 times x plus 3. In LaTeX, that would be written as f(x) = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3. I need to make sure there are no calculation errors here. Let me recheck the slope calculation once more. From (0,3) to (2,0), change in y is 0-3=-3, change in x is 2-0=2. Slope is rise over run, so -3/2. Correct. Then using point-slope form, but since we have the y-intercept, it's straightforward. 

Another way to express this could be converting it to standard form, but the question asks for the function expression, which typically refers to slope-intercept form. So yeah, f(x) = -3/2 x + 3 is the right answer. No other steps seem necessary here. All the given predicates align with this conclusion. The points A and B are correctly placed at the intercepts, and the line connecting them has the required slope and intercepts. Everything checks out.
