Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's given and what needs to be found. 

So, the problem states we have a right-angled triangle ABC, with a right angle at B because of the Perpendicular predicate between Line(A,B) and Line(B,C). Also, one of the acute angles measures 60 degrees, specifically Angle(B,A,C) is 60°, as per MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C),60). One leg, Line(B,C), has length 11. We need to find the length of Line(A,C), denoted as w.

Let me visualize the triangle. Since it's a right-angled triangle at B, sides AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but the problem mentions Line(A,C) as the unknown w. So if the right angle is at B, then AC would be the hypotenuse. However, the given leg is BC with length 11. Let me confirm the points: Points A, B, C form Triangle(A,B,C), with right angle at B. Therefore, AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. But wait, the angle mentioned is Angle(B,A,C), which is the angle at point A? Wait, no. The notation Angle(B,A,C) refers to the angle at point A between points B and C. Wait, no—angle notation is typically the middle letter being the vertex. So Angle(B,A,C) is the angle at point A between BA and CA. Wait, but since the triangle is right-angled at B, the right angle is at B, so angles at A and C are acute. Given that MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C),60), so angle at A is 60 degrees. That means angle at A is 60°, angle at B is 90°, so angle at C must be 30°, since the angles in a triangle add up to 180°. So angles are 90°, 60°, 30°.

Now, the sides opposite these angles: in a right-angled triangle, the side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse. The side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest leg, and the side opposite the 60° angle is longer. Wait, but here the given leg is BC. Let me clarify the triangle structure.

Since the right angle is at B, the legs are AB and BC, and hypotenuse AC. The angle at A is 60°, so the side opposite angle A is BC. Because in triangle ABC, angle at A is between AB and AC. Wait, maybe I should draw this mentally. Point B is the right angle, so AB and BC are perpendicular. Then, angle at A is 60°, so angle between AB and AC is 60°. Wait, perhaps I should assign labels properly.

Let me denote the triangle ABC with right angle at B. Therefore, AB ⊥ BC. The angles are at A, B, C. Given that angle at A is 60°, so ∠BAC = 60°, and since it's a right-angled triangle, the other acute angle at C would be 30°. Now, the sides: in such a triangle, the side opposite the 30° angle is half the hypotenuse. Wait, but which angle corresponds to which side?

If angle at A is 60°, then the side opposite angle A is BC. Because in triangle ABC, side opposite angle A is BC. Similarly, side opposite angle B (the right angle) is AC (hypotenuse). Side opposite angle C is AB.

Given that, since angle at A is 60°, the side opposite (BC) is BC = 11. Then, according to trigonometric ratios, in a right-angled triangle, sin(θ) = opposite / hypotenuse. Alternatively, tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent.

But let's think about the sides. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where the side opposite 30° is the shortest, then opposite 60°, then hypotenuse.

Wait, here angle at A is 60°, so the side opposite angle A is BC = 11. Then, angle at C is 30°, so the side opposite angle C is AB. The hypotenuse is AC.

Therefore, BC (opposite 60°) corresponds to the longer leg, and AB (opposite 30°) is the shorter leg. Hypotenuse AC is twice the shorter leg.

But let me verify. Let's recall that in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

- Opposite 30°: x

- Opposite 60°: x√3

- Hypotenuse: 2x

So if angle at A is 60°, then the side opposite angle A (which is BC) is x√3, and the side opposite angle C (which is AB) is x. The hypotenuse AC is 2x.

But given that BC = 11, which is opposite the 60° angle. Therefore:

BC = x√3 = 11 → x = 11 / √3.

Then, AB, the shorter leg, is x = 11 / √3.

The hypotenuse AC is 2x = 22 / √3.

But the question asks for the length of AC, which is w. So w = 22 / √3. However, rationalizing the denominator, that becomes (22√3)/3. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to compute it using trigonometry. Let's check with tangent. At angle A (60°), the tangent is opposite over adjacent. The opposite side is BC = 11, and the adjacent side is AB. So tan(60°) = BC / AB → tan(60°) = 11 / AB. Since tan(60°) is √3, then √3 = 11 / AB → AB = 11 / √3. Then, using Pythagoras, AC² = AB² + BC². Let's compute that:

AB² = (121)/(3)

BC² = 121

Thus, AC² = 121/3 + 121 = 121/3 + 363/3 = 484/3 → AC = sqrt(484/3) = 22 / √3 = same as before, which simplifies to (22√3)/3.

So w = 22√3 / 3. 

Alternatively, maybe using sine. Since angle at A is 60°, sin(60°) = opposite / hypotenuse = BC / AC. So sin(60°) = 11 / AC. Therefore, AC = 11 / sin(60°). Sin(60°) is √3/2, so AC = 11 / (√3/2) = 11 * 2 / √3 = 22 / √3 = same as before. Rationalized, 22√3 / 3.

Hence, the value of w is 22√3 divided by 3. 

I need to make sure that I didn't mix up the sides. Let me recheck. If angle at A is 60°, then the side opposite is BC. So yes, BC is opposite angle A, so BC = 11. Then, hypotenuse AC is opposite the right angle at B. So using the ratios for 30-60-90 triangle, BC (opposite 60°) is longer leg, AB (opposite 30°) is shorter leg. Hence, hypotenuse AC is twice the shorter leg. 

Alternatively, using the Law of Sines. In triangle ABC, angles are 90°, 60°, 30°. So Law of Sines says:

AB / sin(angle at C) = BC / sin(angle at A) = AC / sin(angle at B)

Angle at C is 30°, angle at A is 60°, angle at B is 90°.

So AB / sin(30°) = BC / sin(60°) = AC / sin(90°).

We know BC = 11. Let's compute AC.

From BC / sin(60°) = AC / sin(90°):

AC = BC * sin(90°) / sin(60°) = 11 * 1 / (√3 / 2) ) = 11 * 2 / √3 = 22 / √3, which again gives us 22√3 / 3 after rationalization.

Yes, consistent across methods. So the answer is 22√3 divided by 3. Thus, the value of w is 22√3⁄3.
