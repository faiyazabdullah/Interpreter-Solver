QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the triangular prism shown. The height is 21 cm. The base is an isosceles triangle with waist length of 10 cm and base length of 12 cm.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the surface area of a triangular prism. The problem says the base is an isosceles triangle with waist lengths of 10 cm and a base length of 12 cm. The height of the prism is 21 cm. Let me start by recalling what a triangular prism is. It's a three-dimensional shape with two congruent triangular bases connected by three rectangular faces. The surface area would then be the sum of the areas of these two triangular bases and the three rectangular sides.

First, let me confirm the details about the triangular base. The base is an isosceles triangle, so two sides are equal. The problem mentions "waist length" which I think refers to the legs of the isosceles triangle, so those two equal sides are each 10 cm. The base of the triangle is 12 cm. So the triangle has sides of 10 cm, 10 cm, and 12 cm.

To find the surface area of the prism, I need to calculate the area of the two triangular bases and the lateral surface area (the areas of the three rectangles). 

Starting with the triangular base. Since it's an isosceles triangle with sides 10, 10, and 12, I can compute its area. But wait, maybe I need to find the height of the triangle first? Because the area of a triangle is (base * height)/2. The base here is 12 cm. To find the height, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. If I split the isosceles triangle along its altitude, it divides the base into two equal parts of 6 cm each. Then, the altitude forms a right triangle with one of the equal sides (10 cm) as the hypotenuse, and the base of 6 cm. So the height h satisfies:

h² + 6² = 10²  
h² + 36 = 100  
h² = 64  
h = 8 cm

So the height of the triangular base is 8 cm. Therefore, the area of one triangular base is (12 * 8)/2 = 48 cm². Since there are two bases, their combined area is 2 * 48 = 96 cm².

Next, the lateral surfaces. These are three rectangles. Each rectangle corresponds to a side of the triangular base. The heights of these rectangles are the same as the height of the prism, which is given as 21 cm. The widths of these rectangles are equal to the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

The three sides of the triangle are 10 cm, 10 cm, and 12 cm. Therefore, the areas of the three rectangles are:

1. Two rectangles with width 10 cm and height 21 cm: each has area 10*21 = 210 cm². So together, they contribute 2*210 = 420 cm².
2. One rectangle with width 12 cm and height 21 cm: area is 12*21 = 252 cm².

Adding these up: 420 + 252 = 672 cm².

Now, the total surface area of the prism is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the three rectangular sides. That is:

Total Surface Area = 96 (from triangles) + 672 (from rectangles) = 768 cm².

Wait, but let me double-check if I missed anything. The problem mentions an altitude of 8 cm for the triangle, which matches my calculation. Also, the height of the prism is 21 cm, which is used for the rectangles. All the given data aligns with this. So adding them up gives 96 + 672 = 768 cm².

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the perimeter of the base triangle multiplied by the height of the prism gives the lateral surface area. Wait, no—actually, the lateral surface area for a prism is indeed the perimeter of the base times the height of the prism. Let me check that formula. Yes, because each side of the base becomes a rectangle with height equal to the prism's height. So perimeter of base is 10 + 10 + 12 = 32 cm. Multiply by 21 cm: 32 * 21 = 672 cm². Then add twice the area of the base (which was 48 * 2 = 96). Total surface area is 672 + 96 = 768 cm². Yep, same result. So that seems correct.

Therefore, the surface area should be 768 square centimeters.
