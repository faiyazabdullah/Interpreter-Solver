====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the surface area of a pyramid. The base is a square with each side measuring 10 mm, and the perpendicular height of the pyramid is 8 mm. Alright, first things first, I should recall how to calculate the surface area of a pyramid. 

From what I remember, the surface area of a pyramid includes the area of the base plus the areas of all the triangular faces. Since it's a square pyramid, there are four triangular faces. But wait, do I need to include the base? The question says "include all faces," so yes, that means the base is part of the surface area. Wait, but sometimes people refer to lateral surface area without the base. Hmm, but the problem specifically says "include all faces," so I think that means the total surface area, including the base.

So, first, let me break down the components. The base is a square with side length 10 mm. The area of the base would be straightforward: side squared. Then, each of the four triangular faces needs to have their areas calculated. To find the area of each triangular face, I need the base length and the slant height of the pyramid. Wait, the problem gives the perpendicular height (which is the vertical height from the apex to the base), not the slant height. So I'll need to compute the slant height using the Pythagorean theorem because the slant height is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid and half the base length.

Let me visualize the pyramid. The base is a square, so if I take one of the triangular faces, its base is 10 mm. The slant height is the distance from the apex of the pyramid to the midpoint of one of the base edges. Let me confirm that. Yes, since the pyramid is square, the slant height can be found by considering the right triangle where one leg is the height of the pyramid (8 mm), and the other leg is half the length of the base's side. Wait, no. Wait, the base of the pyramid is a square with side 10 mm. The distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of one side is half of the side length divided by... Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The apex of the pyramid is directly over the center of the square base because the height is perpendicular to the base. Therefore, if I consider the slant height, it's the distance from the apex to the midpoint of one of the base edges. To find that, imagine cutting the pyramid along the plane that goes through the apex and the midpoint of one of the base edges. That forms a right triangle where one leg is the height of the pyramid (8 mm), and the other leg is half the length of the base edge. Wait, no. Wait, the horizontal distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of a side is half the length of the side divided by something?

Wait, the base is a square. The distance from the center of the square to the midpoint of one of its sides is half the length of the side. Because the square has side length 10 mm, so half of that is 5 mm. Wait, no. Let me think again. The center of the square is at (5,5) if the square is from (0,0) to (10,10). The midpoint of one of the sides, say the top side, would be at (5,10). The distance from the center (5,5) to (5,10) is 5 mm vertically. So yes, that horizontal distance is 5 mm. Therefore, the slant height is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 8 mm (height) and 5 mm (half the base side length). Wait, no, that would be if the horizontal distance was from the center to the midpoint of the side. Wait, but actually, when calculating the slant height for a square pyramid, the formula involves the height and half the base length. Wait, maybe I'm confusing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the slant height can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem where one leg is the pyramid's height (8 mm), and the other leg is half the length of the base's side. Wait, no. Wait, the slant height corresponds to the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge. Let me draw a diagram mentally. The apex is straight above the center of the square base. If I take one of the triangular faces, its base is the side of the square (10 mm), and the slant height is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of that base edge. So, the line from the apex to the midpoint of the base edge is the slant height. 

To find that slant height, we can consider the right triangle formed by the pyramid's height, half the base length, and the slant height. Wait, but the horizontal component isn't half the base length. Wait, the horizontal distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of a side is indeed half the length of the side divided by something? Wait, no. Let me get precise. The center of the square base is at the intersection point of its diagonals. The midpoint of one of the sides is located at a distance of half the side length from the corner. Wait, but the horizontal distance from the center to the midpoint of a side is half of the side length divided by √2? No, that's for the diagonal. Wait, no. Let me think numerically. Suppose the square has side length 10 mm. The coordinates of the square could be considered with vertices at (0,0), (10,0), (10,10), (0,10). The center of the square is at (5,5). The midpoint of the bottom side is at (5,0). The distance from (5,5) to (5,0) is 5 mm. So that horizontal distance is 5 mm. Therefore, the slant height is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 8 mm (height) and 5 mm (horizontal distance). Therefore, slant height l = sqrt(8² + 5²) = sqrt(64 + 25) = sqrt(89) ≈ 9.433 mm.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Because the slant height is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of the base edge. However, the apex is directly above the center of the base. So, if you connect the apex to the midpoint of a base edge, that line is the slant height. So yes, forming a right triangle with the height of the pyramid (8 mm) and the horizontal distance from the center to the midpoint of the base edge (which is 5 mm). Therefore, slant height l = sqrt(8² + 5²) = sqrt(89). 

Therefore, each triangular face has a base of 10 mm and a height of sqrt(89) mm. So the area of one triangular face is (base × slant height)/2 = (10 × sqrt(89))/2 = 5 × sqrt(89). There are four such triangular faces, so total lateral surface area is 4 × 5 × sqrt(89) = 20 × sqrt(89). Then add the area of the base, which is 10×10=100 mm². Therefore, total surface area is 100 + 20√89. 

But let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the slant height. Another way to think about it: In a square pyramid, the slant height can also be calculated using the formula l = sqrt(h² + (s/2)²), where h is the height of the pyramid and s is the side length of the base. Wait, but is that correct? Wait, if the base is a square, then the distance from the center of the base to the midpoint of a side is indeed s/2. Wait, in our case, s=10 mm, so s/2 is 5 mm. Therefore, yes, slant height l = sqrt(8² + 5²) = sqrt(89). So that seems correct. 

So proceeding with that, then the area of each triangular face is (base × slant height)/2 = (10 × sqrt(89))/2 = 5*sqrt(89). Multiply by 4 for all four sides: 4*(5*sqrt(89)) = 20*sqrt(89). Then add the base area, 100. So total surface area is 100 + 20√89. Now, we need to compute this numerically and round to two decimal places. 

First, calculate sqrt(89). Let me compute that. sqrt(81)=9, sqrt(100)=10, so sqrt(89)≈9.43398113... Let me verify with calculator steps. Well, 9.43398113² = 89. So approximately 9.43398. 

Then, 20 multiplied by that is 20 * 9.43398 ≈ 188.6796. Adding the base area of 100, total surface area ≈ 100 + 188.6796 = 288.6796 mm². Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 288.68 mm². 

Wait, but let me check once more if the slant height calculation is correct. Because another way to think about it: Maybe I confused the slant height with the apothem or something else. Wait, in a regular pyramid, the slant height is the distance from the apex to the midpoint of a base edge, which is indeed what we computed. So that's correct. 

Alternatively, sometimes people confuse the slant height with the height of the triangular face. Wait, but in this case, the slant height is the height of the triangular face. Because the triangular face has a base of 10 mm, and its height is the slant height. Therefore, the area of each triangular face is (10 * slant height)/2. So that's correct. 

Another check: Let me compute the numerical value again. Let me compute sqrt(89):

Using calculator approximation: sqrt(89) ≈ 9.433981132...

Multiply by 20: 9.433981132 * 20 = 188.67962264

Add 100: 188.67962264 + 100 = 288.67962264 mm². Rounded to two decimal places: 288.68 mm². 

But wait, let me make sure that the formula for surface area is correct. Total surface area is base area plus lateral surface area. The lateral surface area for a square pyramid is (perimeter of base × slant height)/2. Wait, that formula is for any regular pyramid. Wait, perimeter of base is 4*s, where s is the side length. So, lateral surface area = (4*s * l)/2 = 2*s*l. Which in this case, s=10 mm, l=sqrt(89). So lateral surface area is 2*10*sqrt(89) = 20*sqrt(89). Then adding base area 100. So same as before. Therefore, yes, that formula confirms our previous calculation. 

So, the total surface area is 100 + 20*sqrt(89). Numerically approximated to 288.68 mm². 

But let me cross-validate this with another method. Let's compute each triangular face separately. Each triangular face has base 10 mm and height sqrt(89). So area per face is (10 * sqrt(89))/2 = 5*sqrt(89). Four faces: 4*5*sqrt(89) = 20*sqrt(89). Add base area: 100. Same result. 

Alternatively, if someone mistakenly thought that the slant height was different, like using half the base length instead of the full, but no, that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to ask for lateral surface area without the base. But the question says "include all faces", so the base is included. Therefore, the answer should be 288.68 mm². 

Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if there's another interpretation. For example, maybe the pyramid is not a right pyramid? But the problem states that the height is perpendicular to the base, so it's a right pyramid. Therefore, the slant heights are all equal. 

Yes, everything checks out. So the surface area is approximately 288.68 mm² when rounded to two decimal places.

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation  
#### 1. Slant Height Calculation  
Given:  
- Pyramid height $ h = 8 \, \text{mm} $  
- Half the base length $ \frac{s}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{mm} $  

$$
\text{Slant Height} = \sqrt{h^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{8^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{64 + 25} = \sqrt{89} \approx 9.43398 \, \text{mm}
$$

#### 2. Area of One Triangular Face  
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times \sqrt{89} = 5\sqrt{89}
$$

#### 3. Total Lateral Surface Area  
$$
\text{Lateral SA} = 4 \times 5\sqrt{89} = 20\sqrt{89}
$$

#### 4. Base Area  
$$
\text{Base Area} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \, \text{mm}^2
$$

#### 5. Total Surface Area  
$$
\text{Total SA} = 100 + 20\sqrt{89}
$$

Numerical Evaluation:  
$$
\sqrt{89} \approx 9.43398 \Rightarrow 20\sqrt{89} \approx 20 \times 9.43398 \approx 188.6796
$$
$$
\text{Total SA} \approx 100 + 188.6796 \approx 288.6796 \, \text{mm}^2
$$

Rounded to **two decimal places**:  
$$
\text{Total SA} \approx 288.68 \, \text{mm}^2
$$
