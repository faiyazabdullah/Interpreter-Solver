QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (2,-3) and (-8,-3). It's center is at (-3,-3) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at ($-3-5\sqrt{2}$,-3) and ($-3+5\sqrt{2}$,-3). Find the equation of the hyperbola.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the equation of the hyperbola given the points. So, first, I need to recall what information defines a hyperbola. From what I remember, a hyperbola has two vertices, a center, and foci. The standard form of a hyperbola depends on whether it's opening horizontally or vertically. Since the vertices here are at (2, -3) and (-8, -3), they have the same y-coordinate, so the hyperbola must open left and right, meaning it's a horizontal hyperbola. 

The center of the hyperbola is the midpoint between the vertices. Let me check the given points. The vertices are at (2, -3) and (-8, -3). To find the midpoint, I average the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates. The midpoint's x-coordinate would be (2 + (-8))/2 = (-6)/2 = -3. The y-coordinate is (-3 + (-3))/2 = -3. So the center is indeed (-3, -3), which matches the given point. That checks out.

Now, the distance between the center and each vertex is 'a' for a horizontal hyperbola. Let me calculate that. The distance from the center (-3, -3) to the vertex (2, -3) is |2 - (-3)| = 5 units. So, a = 5.

Next, the foci are located at a distance 'c' from the center along the transverse axis. The given foci are at (-3 - 5√2, -3) and (-3 + 5√2, -3). So, the distance from the center to each focus is 5√2. Therefore, c = 5√2.

For hyperbolas, there's a relationship between a, b, and c: c² = a² + b². So, if I know a and c, I can solve for b. Let me compute that. 

First, compute a²: a = 5, so a² = 25. Then c² = (5√2)² = 25*2 = 50. Then plugging into the formula: 50 = 25 + b² → b² = 50 - 25 = 25. Therefore, b = 5. Wait, but since b is squared, maybe it's positive? Either way, b² is 25.

So, the standard form of a horizontal hyperbola centered at (h, k) is ((x - h)²/a²) - ((y - k)²/b²) = 1. Here, h is -3, k is -3, a² is 25, and b² is 25. Plugging those in, the equation should be [(x + 3)²]/25 - [(y + 3)²]/25 = 1. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me verify if the foci are correctly placed. For a horizontal hyperbola, the foci are located at (h ± c, k). Given the center is (-3, -3), so the foci are at (-3 ± 5√2, -3), which matches the given points. So that seems correct. Also, the vertices are at h ± a, which is -3 ± 5, giving us -3 +5=2 and -3-5=-8, which matches the given vertices. So everything checks out.

Therefore, the equation is [(x + 3)^2]/25 - [(y + 3)^2]/25 = 1. But wait, is there a simpler way to write this? Maybe factor out something? Or perhaps combine terms? Alternatively, since both denominators are the same, we could write it as (x + 3)^2 - (y + 3)^2 = 25. But the standard form usually keeps them separate. However, sometimes people prefer to write it as ((x + 3)^2)/(25) - ((y + 3)^2)/(25) = 1. 

Alternatively, maybe simplifying further, but I think that's as simplified as it gets. Let me confirm once more. The standard form requires the denominators to be a² and b², so yes, they are both 25. Therefore, the equation is correct.
