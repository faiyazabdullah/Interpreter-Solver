MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the equation of a vertical blue line in a graph, given some predicates. Let me start by understanding the given predicates and how they relate to each other.

First, the predicates listed are:

- PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x,0))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(0,y))
- Line(x,0)
- Line(0,y)
- Perpendicular(Line(x,0), Line(0,y))
- Equals(0,0)

Hmm, okay. Let me parse these one by one. 

Starting with PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x,0)). This seems to indicate that the point (0,0) lies on the line defined by Line(x,0). Wait, but Line(x,0) is probably a general form of a horizontal line? Because if you have y=0, that's the x-axis. But here, maybe it's parameterized differently. Similarly, Line(0,y) would be a vertical line? Wait, no. If I think of standard linear equations, a vertical line has the form x = constant, and a horizontal line is y = constant. So Line(x,0) could represent a horizontal line where y=0, which is the x-axis. Similarly, Line(0,y) would be a vertical line where x=0, which is the y-axis. Wait, but the way they're written here is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Line(x,0) refers to a line in the form of y = mx + b, but with specific parameters. Alternatively, maybe the notation is different. For example, sometimes lines are represented parametrically, but maybe in this case, Line(a,b) refers to the line ax + by = c? Or maybe it's a different notation. However, since there's also a Predicate called Perpendicular(Line(x,0), Line(0,y)), which suggests that these two lines are perpendicular. So, if Line(x,0) and Line(0,y) are perpendicular, then they must be the x-axis and y-axis, which are indeed perpendicular. Therefore, Line(x,0) is likely the x-axis (y=0) and Line(0,y) is the y-axis (x=0). 

But wait, the way the Line is written as Line(x,0) might not be correct. Maybe there's confusion here. Let me try to clarify. Suppose Line(x,0) is a horizontal line passing through the origin, so its equation is y = 0. Similarly, Line(0,y) would be a vertical line passing through the origin, so its equation is x = 0. Then, the Perpendicular predicate says these two lines are perpendicular, which is true because the x-axis and y-axis are perpendicular. That makes sense. Also, the PointLiesOnLine predicates state that the origin (0,0) lies on both lines, which aligns with them being the axes. 

Now, the question asks for the equation of a vertical blue line. Since we know that vertical lines have equations of the form x = k, where k is a constant. Given that the existing lines mentioned are the x-axis (y=0) and y-axis (x=0), which are both horizontal and vertical respectively. However, the problem mentions a vertical blue line, which is not specified further. Wait, but the question is just asking for the equation of a vertical line, given the predicates. Wait, but maybe there's more to it. Let me check again.

The user hasn't provided specific points or additional conditions except the ones listed. Wait, the question says "A vertical blue line in the graph. What is the equation of the line?" But the given predicates include Line(x,0) and Line(0,y), which are the x and y axes. But the question is about another vertical line. However, without additional information like a specific point it passes through or slope, how can we determine its equation?

Wait, maybe there's something missing. Let me re-examine the problem statement. The user provided several predicates, including PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x,0)) and similar for Line(0,y). Also, Perpendicular(Line(x,0), Line(0,y)) and Equals(0,0). So, perhaps the vertical line in question is related to these. But the problem states "a vertical blue line in the graph" â€” but the given information includes the y-axis (x=0) as a vertical line. Is the question referring to that? But maybe there's ambiguity.

Alternatively, perhaps the vertical line is the same as Line(0,y)? Wait, Line(0,y) was mentioned earlier. Wait, if Line(0,y) is a vertical line, then its equation would be x=0. But the problem says "a vertical blue line," which could be the y-axis. However, the problem may be expecting us to derive that based on the given predicates. But the question doesn't mention any other points or conditions. Hmm, maybe the answer is simply x=0, which is the y-axis. But why would the question ask for it if it's already given? Unless there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the predicates.

Let me go back. The predicates include Line(x,0) and Line(0,y). If Line(x,0) is the x-axis (y=0) and Line(0,y) is the y-axis (x=0), then the vertical line in question could be the y-axis. But the problem states "a vertical blue line," which might refer to the y-axis. However, without explicit information, maybe the answer is supposed to be derived from the given data. But the problem is phrased as "What is the equation of the line?" implying that it's determined uniquely by the given conditions. However, with the current predicates, there isn't enough info unless we assume that the vertical line is the one mentioned in Line(0,y), which is x=0.

Wait, but the user might have intended that the vertical line is the y-axis, hence x=0. But I need to make sure. Let me think again about the predicates. The Perpendicular predicate confirms that Line(x,0) and Line(0,y) are perpendicular. Since Line(x,0) is horizontal (y=0) and Line(0,y) is vertical (x=0). Therefore, the vertical line in question is x=0. Hence, the answer should be x=0.

But wait, the problem says "a vertical blue line in the graph." If the blue line is the y-axis, then yes, its equation is x=0. But maybe there's more to it. Wait, the original problem didn't specify any particular point that the line passes through, except possibly the origin. But the PointLiesOnLine predicates show that (0,0) lies on Line(x,0) and Line(0,y). So, if the vertical line is Line(0,y), then it passes through the origin. Therefore, the equation is x=0. Thus, the answer is x=0.

Alternatively, if the vertical line is arbitrary, but given the information, maybe the only vertical line mentioned is x=0. Therefore, the answer is x=0. So, the equation of the vertical blue line is x=0, which is the y-axis.

Therefore, after analyzing the given predicates, the vertical line is the y-axis, whose equation is x=0.
