<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the boat goes S 14° E for 12 km, then turns to S 49° E for another 16 km. We need to find the bearing to return to the starting point. Hmm, bearings... okay, so I think this involves some trigonometry, maybe vectors or coordinate geometry?

First, let me visualize the path. Starting at a point, let's call it Start. The first leg is S 14° E, which means from the starting point, the boat heads 14 degrees east of due south. Then, after traveling 12 km, it changes direction to S 49° E for another 16 km. So, the second leg is 49 degrees east of due south. Now, we need to find the bearing from the current position back to the start. That would form a triangle, probably a non-right triangle, so maybe using the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines?

Wait, but the problem mentions angles like 14° and 49°, which might relate to the angles inside the triangle formed by the two legs and the return path. Let me sketch this mentally. Let me denote points: Start (S), then the first point where the boat ends its first leg as Point A, then the second point as Point B. Wait, actually, the problem says "then changes direction to S 49° E for another 16 km." So, the path is Start -> A (first leg) -> B (second leg). Then, the return path is from B back to Start. So, triangle Start-A-B.

But how do these angles come into play? The given predicates mention angles like Angle($2,Start,$)=14 and others. Maybe those correspond to the angles at the starting point? Wait, perhaps the angles mentioned are the angles between the paths? Or maybe they're internal angles of the triangle?

Alternatively, since bearings are involved, maybe breaking the journey into components. Let me try coordinate geometry. Assign coordinates to each point. Let's place the starting point at the origin (0,0). 

The first leg is S 14° E. South is the negative y-axis, East is positive x-axis. So, S 14° E would mean 14 degrees towards East from South. So, the angle between the path and the South direction is 14°, making the direction vector have components based on that angle.

To compute the displacement for the first leg: 12 km at S 14° E. Breaking into components: the y-component (South direction) would be 12*cos(14°), and the x-component (East direction) would be 12*sin(14°). Wait, because if you imagine the angle between the path and the South axis is 14°, then the East component is opposite to the angle, so sin(theta), and the South component is adjacent, cos(theta).

So, coordinates of point A (after first leg): x = 12*sin(14°), y = -12*cos(14°). Because moving South is negative y-direction.

Then, the second leg is S 49° E for 16 km. Similarly, this direction is 49° East of South. So, again, decompose into components. The displacement here would have x-component 16*sin(49°) East, and y-component -16*cos(49°) South. But wait, since the boat is moving from point A to point B, so we need to add these components to the previous coordinates.

So, coordinates of point B: 

Starting from point A, which was (12*sin(14°), -12*cos(14°)), adding the second leg's components:

x-coordinate: 12*sin(14°) + 16*sin(49°)

y-coordinate: -12*cos(14°) - 16*cos(49°)

Now, the return path is from B back to Start (origin). To find the bearing of this return path, we need to find the angle between the line from B to Start and the North-South axis, measured clockwise from North. 

Wait, bearings are typically measured clockwise from North. So, if we have the coordinates of B, we can find the vector from B to Start, which is (-x, -y), since Start is at (0,0). Then, the bearing would depend on the direction of this vector.

Let me formalize this. Let’s denote:

Let’s compute the coordinates of B:

First leg:

Δx1 = 12 * sin(14°)

Δy1 = -12 * cos(14°)

Second leg:

Δx2 = 16 * sin(49°)

Δy2 = -16 * cos(49°)

Total Δx = Δx1 + Δx2

Total Δy = Δy1 + Δy2

Coordinates of B: (Δx, Δy) = (12sin14 + 16sin49, -12cos14 - 16cos49)

So, the vector from B to Start is (-Δx, -Δy). The bearing is the angle θ such that tanθ = (opposite)/(adjacent) relative to North. Wait, how does that work?

If we consider the vector from B to Start, which points from B to (0,0). So, the angle between this vector and the North direction (positive y-axis) is the bearing. However, bearings are measured clockwise from North. So, depending on the quadrant of the vector, the angle could be different.

Alternatively, since the boat is returning from B to Start, the displacement vector is from B to Start. Let me think about the direction. Since the boat went South-East twice, the point B is Southeast of Start, so the return path would go Northwest from B to Start. Therefore, the bearing would be something like N θ W or similar.

But to calculate θ, we need to find the angle between the vector from B to Start and the North direction. Let me consider the slope of the line from B to Start.

Let me denote the coordinates of B as (x, y). Then, the displacement vector from B to Start is (-x, -y). The angle φ that this vector makes with the North direction (positive y-axis) can be found via arctangent of (horizontal change / vertical change). Wait, if we consider the standard coordinate system where x-axis is East and y-axis is North, then the displacement from B to Start has components (-x, -y). So, the angle with respect to the North direction would involve the ratio of East-West component over North-South component.

Wait, suppose we have a vector pointing to the West and South from B to Start (since B is Southeast of Start). Wait, no: if B is Southeast of Start, then from B to Start is Northwest. So, the vector from B to Start has a West component (negative x) and North component (positive y). Therefore, the angle between this vector and the North direction is measured clockwise. So, if we imagine standing at B facing North, the angle between the vector to Start and North is the bearing. Alternatively, the angle between the vector and the North axis, measured clockwise.

To compute this angle, we can take the arctangent of the East-West component divided by the North-South component. Wait, more precisely, if the displacement vector has a horizontal (West-East) component of |Δx| and vertical (North-South) component of |Δy|. Wait, let me clarify:

From B to Start, the displacement is (-x, -y). So, the West component is |-x| = x (if x is positive), and the North component is |-y| = |y| (if y is negative, since original y-coordinate of B was negative, so -y is positive). Wait, original coordinates of B were (x_total, y_total) where x_total is positive (since both legs were Eastward) and y_total is negative (since both legs were Southward). Therefore, displacement from B to Start is (-x_total, -y_total), so:

West component: x_total (since x is positive, so -x is West)

North component: -y_total. Since y_total was negative, -y_total is positive.

Therefore, the tangent of the angle θ (bearing) is West component / North component = x_total / (-y_total). Wait, but the angle between the vector and North is θ, so tanθ = (West component) / (North component). Therefore:

tanθ = (x_total) / (|y_total|) ?

Wait, let me make sure. If the displacement vector is going West and North, then the angle from North to the vector is θ, where tanθ = opposite/adjacent = West distance / North distance. Yes. So θ = arctan(West / North).

But since the bearing is measured clockwise from North, θ would be the angle we want. However, depending on the actual values, θ could be acute or obtuse. But since the boat is returning from Southeast to Start, θ would be between 0 and 90 degrees? Not necessarily. Wait, if the displacement is Northwest, then the bearing would be N θ W, where θ is the angle west of north. So, the bearing is 180° - θ? No, bearings are measured clockwise from North. So if the vector is pointing NW, then the bearing is 360° - θ, but since it's in the second quadrant (NW), the bearing would be 180° - θ? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, let's think of the vector from B to Start as having components Δx = -x_total and Δy = -y_total. So, in terms of standard coordinate system, where x is East and y is North. The angle α that this vector makes with the positive y-axis (North) is given by tanα = Δx / Δy. Wait, no. The angle between the vector and the y-axis is α, so tanα = (Δx)/Δy. But since the vector is pointing West and North, Δx is negative (West) and Δy is positive (North). So, tanα = (Δx)/Δy = (-x_total)/(-y_total) ??? Wait, no. Wait, the vector is (-x_total, -y_total). So, Δx = -x_total, which is West (negative x), and Δy = -y_total. Since y_total was negative (from earlier), -y_total is positive (North). Therefore, tanα = Δx / Δy = (-x_total) / (-y_total) = x_total / y_total_abs.

Wait, but α is the angle between the vector and the y-axis (North). Since the vector is in the second quadrant (West and North), the angle α is measured counterclockwise from the y-axis to the vector. But bearings are measured clockwise from North. So, the bearing would be 180° - α? Or is there another way?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the angle between the vector and the North direction, considering the direction of the vector. Since the vector is pointing West and North, the bearing is measured clockwise from North towards West, which would be 180° minus the angle between the vector and the West direction?

This seems confusing. Maybe using coordinate system and inverse tangent is better.

Let me define:

Let’s denote the total displacement from Start to B as vector AB. The return path is BA. To find the bearing of BA, which is the direction from B to Start.

Let’s compute the coordinates of B first. Let me calculate x_total and y_total.

Compute x_total = 12*sin(14°) + 16*sin(49°)

Similarly, y_total = -12*cos(14°) - 16*cos(49°)

Once we have x_total and y_total, then the displacement vector from B to Start is (-x_total, -y_total). So, the vector is (-x_total, -y_total). To find the bearing, we need the angle between this vector and the North direction (positive y-axis), measured clockwise.

In standard coordinate system, the angle θ from the positive y-axis to the vector, measured clockwise, can be computed as follows:

The vector has components Δx = -x_total (West) and Δy = -y_total (North). So, the angle θ satisfies tanθ = |Δx| / Δy. Wait, but θ is measured clockwise from North. So, if the vector is in the second quadrant (West and North), then θ is between 90° and 180°? No, bearings are between 0° and 360°. If the vector is pointing West-North, the bearing is 180° - α, where α is the angle between the vector and the North direction.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to compute the angle with respect to the positive x-axis and adjust accordingly. Let me recall that in standard math coordinates, angles are measured counterclockwise from positive x-axis. But bearings are measured clockwise from North.

So, perhaps convert the vector to polar coordinates, then adjust to bearing.

Let me think. Suppose we have a vector from B to Start with components dx = -x_total and dy = -y_total. The angle φ from the positive x-axis (East) to this vector is given by:

φ = arctan(dy / dx). But since dx is negative (West) and dy is positive (North), φ is in the second quadrant. So, φ = π - arctan(|dy/dx|). Then, to get the bearing, which is measured clockwise from North, we can compute:

Bearing = 90° - φ, but adjusted for the correct quadrant.

Wait, let me think again. If φ is the angle from the positive x-axis (East) to the vector, then the angle from the positive y-axis (North) clockwise to the vector would be 90° - φ if φ is in the first quadrant. But since our vector is in the second quadrant (West and North), φ is between 90° and 180°, so the bearing would be 90° - φ + 360° if negative? Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe there's a formula.

Alternatively, the bearing θ satisfies:

tan(θ) = (East component) / (North component)

But since the vector from B to Start has East component = -dx (which is x_total, because dx is -x_total, so East component is -dx = x_total?), no. Wait, confusion arises here.

Let me rephrase. The displacement from B to Start is (-x_total, -y_total). So, the East component is -x_total (which is negative, i.e., West), and the North component is -y_total (which is positive, since y_total was negative). Therefore, the vector has a West component of x_total and a North component of |y_total|.

Thus, the angle θ (bearing) from North is such that tanθ = (West component) / (North component) = x_total / |y_total|.

Since the bearing is measured clockwise from North, θ is the angle we need. Therefore, θ = arctan(x_total / |y_total|).

Wait, but this depends on whether x_total and |y_total| are positive. In this case, yes, since x_total is positive (as both legs were East) and |y_total| is positive (since y_total was negative). Therefore, θ = arctan(x_total / |y_total|).

So, once we compute x_total and |y_total|, we can find θ.

Alternatively, since x_total and y_total are known expressions, we can combine them.

But maybe instead of calculating numerically, we can use the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines on the triangle formed by Start, A, and B.

Wait, the problem gives us the lengths of the two sides: SA = 12 km, AB = 16 km, and SB is the return path, which we need to find the angle for the bearing. Wait, but the question isn't directly asking for the length of SB, but the bearing. However, maybe using the Law of Cosines to find the angle at B or something else.

Alternatively, since we know two sides and the included angle? Wait, not sure. Wait, the angles given in the predicates are 14° and 49°, but I need to check how they relate to the triangle.

Wait, looking back at the initial problem statement, the user provided some predicates including angles like Angle($2,Start,$)=14 and others. But since this is a generated problem, perhaps the angles given in the problem (the 14° and 49°) are the angles between the respective directions and the axes, which we already considered in the coordinate method.

But regardless, proceeding with the coordinate method seems feasible. Let me proceed with calculating x_total and y_total.

Calculating x_total:

x_total = 12*sin(14°) + 16*sin(49°)

Calculate each term:

First term: 12*sin(14°). Let me compute sin(14°):

sin(14°) ≈ 0.2419

So, 12*0.2419 ≈ 2.9028 km

Second term: 16*sin(49°). sin(49°) ≈ 0.7547

So, 16*0.7547 ≈ 12.0752 km

So, x_total ≈ 2.9028 + 12.0752 ≈ 14.978 km ≈ 15.0 km (approximate)

Now y_total:

y_total = -12*cos(14°) -16*cos(49°)

Compute each term:

First term: -12*cos(14°). cos(14°) ≈ 0.9703

So, -12*0.9703 ≈ -11.6436 km

Second term: -16*cos(49°). cos(49°) ≈ 0.6561

So, -16*0.6561 ≈ -10.4976 km

Adding together: -11.6436 -10.4976 ≈ -22.1412 km

So, y_total ≈ -22.1412 km

Therefore, the displacement from B to Start is (-x_total, -y_total) = (-14.978, 22.1412)

So, the vector from B to Start has components Δx = -14.978 (West) and Δy = 22.1412 (North)

Therefore, the bearing θ is arctan(Δx / Δy) ? Wait, no. As discussed earlier, the bearing is measured clockwise from North, so tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent = West component / North component = 14.978 / 22.1412

So theta = arctan(14.978 / 22.1412)

Calculate that ratio: 14.978 / 22.1412 ≈ 0.676

arctan(0.676) ≈ 34 degrees (since tan(34°) ≈ 0.6745)

So approximately 34 degrees. Therefore, the bearing is N 34° W? Wait, no. Wait, the angle theta is measured clockwise from North towards West. Wait, if the vector is pointing West and North, then the bearing is N theta W, where theta is the angle west of north. So, theta ≈ 34°, so the bearing is N 34° W. But bearings are usually expressed as three digits, e.g., 340°, but sometimes written as N 34° W. However, the problem asks for the bearing to return to the starting point. Depending on conventions, the answer could be either 34° west of north or converted to a standard bearing.

Wait, but bearings are typically given as a number between 0° and 360°, measured clockwise from North. So, if the angle from North towards West is 34°, then the bearing is 180° - 34° = 146°? Wait, no. Let me think again.

Imagine facing North. Turning clockwise towards West, the angle is 34°, which would put the direction in the second quadrant. Bearings are measured clockwise from North. So, starting at North (0°), turning 34° towards West would be 34°, but that's not right. Wait, no. If you face North and turn clockwise, East is 90°, South is 180°, West is 270°, etc. Wait, no. Clockwise from North:

- 0° is North,

- 90° is East,

- 180° is South,

- 270° is West.

So, if the direction is Northwest, it's somewhere between 180° and 270°? No. Wait, if you are heading West-North, it's between North and West. So, for example, a bearing of 315° is North-West (N 45° W), which is 315°, which is equivalent to 45° West of North.

Wait, if the angle between the vector and North is 34° towards West, then the bearing is 360° - 34° = 326°? No, because 34° West of North would be measured as 360° - 34° = 326°? Wait, no. Wait, if you are facing North and turn 34° towards West, that's 34° clockwise from North towards West, which would be a bearing of 34°? No, that doesn't align with standard bearings. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let me think with an example. Suppose you are facing North and turn 34° towards West. That would be 34° West of North, which is a bearing of 34°, but in standard terms, bearings are measured clockwise from North. So, a bearing of 34° would mean 34° East of North, not West. Wait, that contradicts. Wait, no. Bearings are measured clockwise from North. So:

- 0° is North,

- 90° is East,

- 180° is South,

- 270° is West.

Therefore, a direction that is 34° West of North would be measured as 360° - 34° = 326°, since you rotate 34° clockwise from North towards West. Wait, no. Rotating clockwise from North, to get to West, you go 270°, so 34° West of North would be 360° - 34° = 326°, which is equivalent to -34°, but bearings are always positive. So, the bearing is 326°, which is equivalent to N 34° W.

Therefore, the bearing to return is 326°, or stated as N 34° W. However, the problem may expect the answer in a particular format. Given that the initial legs had bearings described as S 14° E and S 49° E, which are measured from South, the answer likely expects a similar format, but for the return path. Since the return path is from B to Start, which is Northwest, the bearing would be N θ W, where θ is the angle we calculated (~34°). Therefore, the answer is N 34° W, or equivalently, a bearing of 326°.

But let me verify the calculation of theta. Earlier, we approximated the ratio as ~0.676, leading to arctan(0.676) ≈ 34°. Let me check that more accurately.

Using calculator input:

tan(theta) = 14.978 / 22.1412 ≈ 0.676

Calculating arctan(0.676):

I know that tan(34°) ≈ 0.6745, tan(34.5°) ≈ tan(34° + 0.5°). Let me compute tan(34.5°):

Using calculator: tan(34.5°) ≈ tan(π/2 - 55.5°)? No, just compute it.

Approximately, 34.5°:

Let me use linear approximation. Between 34° and 35°:

At 34°, tan(34°) ≈ 0.6745

At 35°, tan(35°) ≈ 0.7002

Our value is 0.676, which is between these two.

Difference between 0.6745 and 0.7002 is approximately 0.0257 over 1 degree.

We have 0.676 - 0.6745 = 0.0015 above 34°, so fraction is 0.0015 / 0.0257 ≈ 0.058. So, approximately 0.058 degrees beyond 34°, so around 34.058°, roughly 34.06°. So, approximately 34.1°. So, theta ≈ 34.1°, so the bearing is N 34.1° W, which rounds to approximately 34°.

But to be precise, let's carry out the exact calculation with more accurate numbers.

Earlier, I approximated x_total as 14.978 km and |y_total| as 22.1412 km. Let me recalculate x_total and y_total with more precise sine and cosine values.

First, compute x_total:

sin(14°):

Using calculator, sin(14°) ≈ 0.24192189...

So, 12 * 0.24192189 ≈ 2.9030627 km

sin(49°):

sin(49°) ≈ 0.75470958...

So, 16 * 0.75470958 ≈ 12.0753533 km

Total x_total ≈ 2.9030627 + 12.0753533 ≈ 14.978416 km

Now y_total:

cos(14°) ≈ 0.9702957...

So, -12 * 0.9702957 ≈ -11.643548 km

cos(49°) ≈ 0.6560589...

So, -16 * 0.6560589 ≈ -10.496942 km

Total y_total ≈ -11.643548 -10.496942 ≈ -22.14049 km

Thus, |y_total| = 22.14049 km

Therefore, tan(theta) = x_total / |y_total| ≈ 14.978416 / 22.14049 ≈ Let's compute this division:

Divide numerator and denominator by 14.978416:

≈ 1 / (22.14049 / 14.978416) ≈ 1 / 1.479 ≈ 0.676

As before. So tan(theta) ≈ 0.676

Let me compute this with more precise calculation:

Let me calculate 14.978416 ÷ 22.14049:

≈ 14.978416 / 22.14049 ≈ 0.676

So, theta ≈ arctan(0.676). Using a calculator, arctan(0.676) is approximately 34.1 degrees. Therefore, the bearing is N 34.1° W.

But let me confirm with more accurate computation. Let me use a calculator for arctan(0.676):

Using a calculator, arctan(0.676) ≈ 34.1 degrees. Yes. So, approximately 34.1 degrees. Thus, the bearing is N 34.1° W, which can be rounded to 34°, depending on required precision.

However, the problem may require an exact value. Wait, but how? Because the given angles in the problem were 14° and 49°, which are not complementary or supplementary to give a clean angle. So, the answer is likely expected to be approximate, say to one decimal place or whole degree.

But maybe there's a way to compute this angle using the Law of Cosines or Law of Sines without resorting to coordinates. Let me think.

Consider triangle Start-A-B. We know SA = 12 km, AB = 16 km, and the angle at Start is the sum of the two given angles? Wait, no. Wait, the first leg is S 14° E, then the second leg is S 49° E. What is the angle at Start between the two legs?

Wait, the first leg is from Start to A, direction S 14° E. The second leg is from A to B, direction S 49° E. But the angle at Start is not directly given. Wait, but perhaps the angle between the two paths from Start?

No, the angle between the two paths is not directly given. Wait, but maybe using the Law of Cosines on triangle Start-A-B. Wait, we need to find the angle at Start or at B?

Alternatively, since we have two sides and the angle between them? No, unless we can find the angle between SA and SB.

Wait, but how? The given angles in the problem (14° and 49°) are the angles between the respective paths and the South direction. So, the angle between the first leg (SA) and the South direction is 14°, and between the second leg (AB) and the South direction is 49°. But how does that translate to the angle between SA and AB?

Wait, let me imagine: At point A, the boat changes direction from S 14° E to S 49° E. So, the angle between the two paths (SA and AB) is the difference between the two angles with respect to South? Or is there some other relationship?

Alternatively, think of the entire journey as forming a triangle with Start, A, and B. The angle at Start is determined by the two bearings. Let me try to find the angle at Start.

The first leg is S 14° E from Start. So, the direction of SA is 14° East of South. The second leg is from A to B, which is S 49° E. So, the direction from A to B is S 49° E. But what is the angle between SA and AB?

Alternatively, think of the angles between the paths and the reference directions. From Start, the first leg is S 14° E, so the angle between SA and South is 14°. From A, the second leg is S 49° E, so the angle between AB and South is 49°. But the angle between SA and AB would be the difference between these two angles plus something? This seems unclear.

Alternatively, consider the overall triangle. The angle at Start between SA and SB is the angle between the first leg and the return path. But without knowing the length of SB, it's hard to apply Law of Cosines.

Alternatively, using the coordinates method gave us an approximate angle of 34.1°, which might be the answer. However, since the problem includes predicates with angles of 14° and 49°, perhaps there's a relation between these angles and the desired bearing. Maybe using the Law of Sines on the triangle?

Wait, if we consider triangle Start-A-B, with sides SA = 12, AB = 16, and SB being the return path. We can attempt to find the angle at Start or at B.

But to use Law of Cosines, we need an angle. Wait, but if we can find the angle at Start, then we can apply Law of Cosines.

How to find the angle at Start? It depends on the directions of the two legs.

The first leg is S 14° E from Start, and the second leg is from A to B, which is S 49° E. But the angle at Start between SA and SB is not directly given. However, perhaps we can find it by considering the angles between the paths and the axes.

Let me draw this mentally. From Start, the boat goes S 14° E (towards A). Then, from A, it goes S 49° E (towards B). So, the angle between SA and AB is the angle between the direction of SA (S 14° E) and the direction of AB (S 49° E). But since these are two different directions, the angle between them depends on the relative positions.

Wait, but the angle between SA and AB would be the external angle at point A? Or not. It's complicated.

Alternatively, since we have two legs from Start to A and from A to B, the angle at A between SA and AB is the difference between the two bearings? Not sure.

Alternatively, using the Law of Cosines on triangle Start-A-B, but we need an angle. Since we don't know the angle, this might not help.

Given that the coordinate method gave us an approximate answer of 34.1°, and assuming that the problem expects this kind of calculation, perhaps this is the intended approach.

Thus, the bearing is approximately 34°, so the answer is N 34° W, or in bearing terms, 326°. Depending on the convention required.

But to express it as a bearing, typically, it would be 326°, but sometimes problems prefer stating it as N 34° W. However, the problem says "write down the bearing that the boat should travel on to return to the starting point". Bearings are often expressed as a three-digit number, so 326°, or as N 34° W.

But to confirm, let's see. If the angle theta is 34.1°, then the bearing is measured clockwise from North, which would be 180° - 34.1°? No, that would be if the angle was measured from South. Wait, no. Earlier analysis suggested it's 326°, which is 360° - 34.1° = 325.9°, approximately 326°.

Yes, because if you face North and turn 34.1° towards West, that's 34.1°, but bearings are measured clockwise, so it's 360° - 34.1° = 325.9°, which is approximately 326°. Hence, the bearing is 326°, which is equivalent to N 34° W.

But let me check with more precise calculation. Earlier, tan(theta) = 14.978 / 22.14049 ≈ 0.676. Let me calculate theta more accurately.

Using a calculator, arctan(0.676) is approximately:

Let me recall that tan(34°) ≈ 0.6745, tan(34.1°) = tan(34° + 0.1°). Let me calculate tan(34.1°):

Using small angle approximation, tan(34° + 0.1°) ≈ tan(34°) + 0.1°*(π/180)*sec²(34°). 

But this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, using calculator-like computation:

Assume that tan(theta) = 0.676. Let me use iterative method.

Let me assume theta ≈ 34.1°, as before. Let's compute tan(34.1°):

Convert 34.1° to radians: 34.1 * π/180 ≈ 0.596 radians.

tan(0.596) ≈ sin(0.596)/cos(0.596). Let me estimate:

sin(0.596) ≈ 0.563 (exact value needs calculator, but for estimation purposes...)

Wait, this is not helpful. Alternatively, accept that with tan(theta) ≈ 0.676, theta ≈ 34.1°, giving bearing of 326°.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 34°, so the bearing is N 34° W or 326°. Depending on the problem's expectation, but since bearings are often given as a three-digit number, I'll go with 326°, but I need to check if this matches with the Law of Cosines approach.

Alternatively, let me try applying Law of Cosines on the triangle.

We have SA = 12 km, AB = 16 km, and need to find angle at Start or at B.

But to find angle at Start, we need more info. Alternatively, using Law of Cosines on triangle Start-A-B:

SB² = SA² + AB² - 2*SA*AB*cos(angle at A)

But we don't know angle at A. However, perhaps we can find angle at A using the given bearings?

At point A, the boat changed direction from S 14° E to S 49° E. So, the angle at A between SA and AB is the difference between the two directions?

Wait, the first leg SA is from Start to A, direction S 14° E. The second leg AB is from A to B, direction S 49° E. So, at point A, the direction from A to Start (reverse of SA) is N 14° W, and the direction from A to B is S 49° E. So, the angle at A between SA (extended backwards) and AB is the angle between N 14° W and S 49° E.

To find this angle, imagine standing at point A. The direction from A to Start is N 14° W (opposite of S 14° E). The direction from A to B is S 49° E. So, the angle between N 14° W and S 49° E is 14° + 49° = 63°, since they are on opposite sides of the vertical axis.

Wait, if you have one direction N 14° W and another direction S 49° E, the angle between them is 14° + 49° = 63°, because they are on opposite sides of the vertical line.

Therefore, the angle at A is 63°. So, in triangle Start-A-B, angle at A is 63°, sides SA = 12, AB = 16, and we can apply Law of Cosines to find SB.

Law of Cosines: SB² = SA² + AB² - 2*SA*AB*cos(angle at A)

Plugging in:

SB² = 12² + 16² - 2*12*16*cos(63°)

Compute:

12² = 144

16² = 256

Sum: 144 + 256 = 400

2*12*16 = 384

cos(63°) ≈ 0.4540

So, SB² = 400 - 384*0.4540 ≈ 400 - 384*0.4540

Calculate 384 * 0.4540:

First, 384 * 0.4 = 153.6

384 * 0.054 = 384 * 0.05 + 384 * 0.004 = 19.2 + 1.536 = 20.736

Total ≈ 153.6 + 20.736 = 174.336

So, SB² ≈ 400 - 174.336 = 225.664

Therefore, SB ≈ sqrt(225.664) ≈ 15.02 km

Now, with SB known, we can apply Law of Sines to find the angle at Start or at B.

Let's find angle at Start (let's call it alpha), which is the angle between SA and SB. This angle would be used to determine the bearing.

Law of Sines: SB / sin(angle at A) = SA / sin(angle at B) = AB / sin(alpha)

We can solve for alpha:

sin(alpha) = (AB / SB) * sin(angle at A)

Plug in values:

AB = 16 km

SB ≈ 15.02 km

angle at A = 63°

So:

sin(alpha) = (16 / 15.02) * sin(63°)

Calculate:

16 / 15.02 ≈ 1.065

sin(63°) ≈ 0.8910

Multiply: 1.065 * 0.8910 ≈ 0.948

So, alpha ≈ arcsin(0.948) ≈ 71.2°

Wait, arcsin(0.948) is approximately 71 degrees, since sin(70°) ≈ 0.9397, sin(71°) ≈ 0.9455, sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511. Our value is 0.948, which is between 71° and 72°, closer to 71.5°. Let's say approximately 71.5°.

So, angle at Start (alpha) is approximately 71.5°. What does this represent?

Alpha is the angle at Start between SA and SB. But SA is the first leg (direction S 14° E), and SB is the return path. So, the angle between SA and SB is 71.5°. But how does this relate to the bearing?

Wait, the bearing from B to Start is along SB. So, the angle between SA (which is S 14° E) and SB is 71.5°. To find the bearing of SB, we need to determine its direction relative to the cardinal directions.

Let me visualize: From Start, the boat traveled S 14° E (which is 14° East of South). The angle between SA and SB is 71.5°, so the direction of SB is 71.5° from SA. Since SA is S 14° E, adding this angle to determine the direction of SB.

Wait, but depending on which side the angle is measured. If alpha is the angle between SA and SB at Start, then SB is on the other side of SA from the direction of AB. This requires careful diagramming.

Alternatively, since the boat went from Start to A (S 14° E), then turned to go S 49° E to B. The angle at Start between SA and SB is alpha = 71.5°, so the direction of SB is alpha degrees from SA.

But SA is S 14° E, so if we measure 71.5° from SA towards the direction opposite to AB, what would that be?

This is getting complex. Perhaps using vector methods is clearer.

Alternatively, since we found using coordinates that the bearing is approximately 34.1°, and using Law of Cosines gave us angle at Start of ~71.5°, which might be related.

Wait, if the angle at Start between SA and SB is 71.5°, and SA is S 14° E, then the direction of SB would be 71.5° from SA. Since SA is S 14° E, adding this angle to determine SB's direction.

But the direction of SB is the return path, which we previously calculated as N 34° W. How does this relate?

Let me think: If the angle between SA (S 14° E) and SB is 71.5°, then SB is at 71.5° from SA. Depending on the orientation, this could be either to the left or right of SA. Assuming the
