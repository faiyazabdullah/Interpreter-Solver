MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the first maximum point of the function y = -5 sin x for x ≥ 0. The given information includes some predicates about the sine function passing through certain points and being symmetric about the origin. 

First, I need to recall how the sine function behaves. Normally, the standard sine function y = sin x has its maximum at π/2 radians (which is 90 degrees), where it reaches 1. Then it goes back down to zero at π radians (180 degrees), reaches a minimum at 3π/2 radians (270 degrees) with -1, and returns to zero at 2π radians (360 degrees). This pattern repeats every 2π radians.

But here, we have the function y = -5 sin x. The negative sign reflects the graph of the sine wave over the x-axis. That means instead of having maxima where the original sine function had minima, and vice versa. So, the maximum of y = -5 sin x would occur where sin x is at its minimum, which is at 3π/2 radians (270 degrees) for the standard sine function. However, since the amplitude is scaled by 5, the maximum value becomes 5 instead of 1. Wait, no—wait. Let me think again. If you take -5 sin x, then when sin x is -1 (minimum of sin x), multiplying by -5 gives 5. So the maximum value of y = -5 sin x is 5, achieved when sin x = -1. Therefore, the maximum occurs at x = 3π/2 + 2πk, where k is an integer. But since we're looking for the first maximum point for x ≥ 0, the smallest positive x would be 3π/2 radians, which is 270 degrees. 

Wait, but the given points in the predicates mention points like (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), etc., which correspond to the standard sine function. However, the question is about y = -5 sin x. So applying the transformation, the standard points would be transformed. For example, the point (90°, 1) on y = sin x would become (90°, -5*1) = (90°, -5). Similarly, the point (270°, -1) would become (270°, 5). 

Therefore, the maximum of y = -5 sin x occurs where the original sine function has its minimum. The first occurrence of the minimum in the standard sine function is at 270°, so the corresponding maximum for y = -5 sin x would be at 270°, which is the same x-coordinate as the original minimum. Thus, the first maximum point is at (270°, 5). 

But wait, let me confirm. The original sine function's maximum is at 90°, but after reflecting over the x-axis, that becomes a minimum. The next maximum would be where the original sine function was at its minimum. Since the original sine function's minimum is at 270°, then reflecting over x-axis flips that to a maximum. Hence, yes, the first maximum for y = -5 sin x is at x = 270°, which is 270 degrees, giving y = 5. 

So converting 270° to radians, if needed? Wait, the question doesn't specify whether to present the answer in degrees or radians. Looking back at the given points, they are presented in degrees: (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), etc. So likely, the answer should be in degrees. Therefore, the first maximum point is at (270°, 5). 

But let me check if there's any other consideration. For instance, could there be a maximum before 270°? Well, the standard sine function starts at (0,0), rises to (90°, 1), comes back down to (180°, 0), then to (270°, -1), then up to (360°, 0). Reflecting over the x-axis, the function y = -5 sin x would start at (0,0), go down to (90°, -5), rise to (180°, 0), then down to (270°, 5), then back to (360°, 0). Wait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Let me re-express the function y = -5 sin x. Let's consider the transformations. The original sin x has a period of 2π. Multiplying by -5 vertically scales it by 5 and reflects it over the x-axis. So, the maximum value of the original sin x is 1, so after scaling by -5, the maximum becomes 5 when sin x is -1. Because -5*(sin x) would be maximized when sin x is minimized. So, when does sin x reach its minimum? At 3π/2 radians, which is 270 degrees. So, substituting x=270°, sin(270°)= -1, so y = -5*(-1) = 5. Therefore, the maximum point is at x=270°, y=5. 

But wait, when x increases from 0° to 270°, the function y = -5 sin x starts at 0, decreases to -5 at 90°, then increases to 0 at 180°, then decreases to -5 at 270°? No, that doesn't seem right. Let me plot the points step by step. 

At x=0°, sin(0)=0 → y=0. 
At x=90°, sin(90°)=1 → y=-5*1 = -5. 
At x=180°, sin(180°)=0 → y=0. 
At x=270°, sin(270°)= -1 → y=-5*(-1)=5. 
At x=360°, sin(360°)=0 → y=0. 

Ah! So the function y=-5 sin x starts at (0,0), goes down to (90°, -5), back up to (180°, 0), then down to (270°, 5)? Wait, no. From x=180° to x=270°, sin x goes from 0 to -1. So y = -5 sin x would go from 0 to 5. So, between 180° and 270°, the function is increasing from 0 to 5. Therefore, the maximum at 270° is indeed the first maximum after x=0. So the first maximum point is at x=270°, y=5. 

Therefore, the coordinates are (270, 5). But the problem says "for x ≥ 0", so the first maximum is at x=270°, which is the first time the function reaches its maximum. 

Hence, the answer should be (270, 5). 

But let me check once more. Another way to think: the function y = -5 sin x can also be written as y = 5 sin(x + π), because shifting the sine function left by π radians (since sin(x + π) = -sin x). So, the maximum of 5 sin(x + π) occurs when x + π = π/2 + 2πk, leading to x = -π/2 + 2πk. The first positive x would be when k=1: x = -π/2 + 2π = 3π/2, which is 270°. So yes, confirming that the first maximum is at 270°, y=5. 

Thus, the coordinates of the first maximum point are (270, 5).
