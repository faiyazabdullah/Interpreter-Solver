<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and figure out the structure of the geometric figure. Let me start by listing out all the points and lines mentioned.

The points are A, B, C, D, E, F, G. Then there are several lines connecting them: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,D), Line(D,E), Line(E,F), Line(F,A), Line(F,G), Line(G,E). So, these lines form some sort of polygon or maybe a combination of polygons. 

Looking at the lengths given: LengthOf(Line(A,F),1) means AF is 1 meter. LengthOf(Line(B,C),3) so BC is 3 meters. LengthOf(Line(E,D),2) gives ED as 2 meters. LengthOf(Line(A,B),5) so AB is 5 meters. Also, there's LengthOf(Line(E,F),x) and LengthOf(Line(C,D),y), which are variables we need to find. 

Then there are some angle-related predicates: RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)) implies that angle at point B between A-B-C is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(F,G,E)) means the angle at G between F-G-E is a right angle. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,B),Line(B,C)) confirms that AB is perpendicular to BC, which aligns with the right angle at B. Similarly, Perpendicular(Line(F,G),Line(G,E)) for the right angle at G. 

Additionally, Parallel(Line(A,B),Line(F,G)) tells us that AB is parallel to FG. And LengthOf(Line(F,G),2) says FG is 2 meters. Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,E)),2) means GE is also 2 meters. 

There are also PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(A,C)) indicating that point B lies on line AC. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(E,Line(D,E)) seems redundant because E is obviously on line DE. Wait, maybe that's just emphasizing that E is on line DE? Or perhaps there's more to it. Maybe other points lie on certain lines? Not sure yet.

Now, the question is about building a fence around the entire perimeter of the land, with fencing costing £37 per meter. We need to find the total cost, which depends on the sum of all the sides' lengths multiplied by 37. Since they mention EF is x and CD is y, but we need to find expressions for x and y first.

Let me try to visualize the figure. Starting with the points connected as follows:

AB connects A to B, BC connects B to C, CD connects C to D, DE connects D to E, EF connects E to F, FA connects F back to A. Additionally, there's FG connecting F to G and GE connecting G to E. So, there's another triangle or shape involving F, G, E. Also, since FG is parallel to AB, and AB is length 5, FG is length 2. Also, GE is 2 meters, and since Angle at G is a right angle, triangle FGE is a right triangle with legs FG=2 and GE=2, making FE the hypotenuse. Therefore, FE would be sqrt(2² + 2²) = sqrt(8) = 2√2. But wait, the problem states that LengthOf(Line(E,F),x) is x, so x here would be 2√2. However, let me check if that's correct.

But before jumping to conclusions, let me make sure about the connections. Points F and G are connected to E, forming the right angle at G. So F-G-E is a right angle, hence triangle FGE is right-angled at G. Given FG = 2 and GE = 2, then yes, FE should be 2√2. Hence, x = 2√2. That would mean EF is 2√2 meters. But wait, the problem mentions EF as part of the perimeter. So EF is one side, and CD is another variable y. So I need to find the value of y.

To find y, which is CD. Let's look at the rest of the figure. Let me consider the other parts. There's a line from C to D (CD), and then D to E (DE=2). Also, there's a line from B to C (BC=3), and AB=5. Also, point B lies on line AC. Hmm, so point B is on line AC. Which suggests that points A, B, C are colinear? Wait, no. If point B lies on line AC, then line AC passes through B. Wait, but AB is a separate line. Wait, Line(A,B) exists, and Line(B,C) exists. So AB and BC are connected at B. But if B lies on line AC, then points A, B, C are colinear? Because line AC passes through B. So ABC forms a straight line. But then AB is part of AC, and BC is part of AC. Wait, but earlier we have that AB is perpendicular to BC. If ABC were colinear, then AB and BC would be in a straight line, not perpendicular. Contradiction! So something's wrong here. Wait, maybe my interpretation is incorrect.

Wait, the predicate says "PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C))", which means that point B lies on the line AC. So line AC passes through B. But Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are two different lines? Wait, no. If B is on line AC, then line AB is part of line AC, and line BC is also part of line AC. Therefore, AB and BC are collinear, but the problem states that AB is perpendicular to BC. This seems contradictory unless AB and BC are not connected at B. Wait, but Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are connected at B. How can AB be perpendicular to BC if B is on line AC? Unless the line AC isn't straight? No, lines are straight. Wait, this seems conflicting. There's a contradiction here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I misread the predicate. It says "PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C))". So point B lies on the line AC. So line AC includes point B. Therefore, points A, B, C are colinear. But Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are the same line? Because B is between A and C. Then AB and BC are segments of the same line, so they can't be perpendicular. But the predicate says Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)). That's impossible if they are colinear. Therefore, there's an inconsistency here. Did I misinterpret something?

Alternatively, maybe "Line(A,C)" refers to a different line than the ones we've already considered. Wait, no. All lines are defined by pairs of points. So Line(A,C) is a line passing through A and C. If B lies on this line, then AB and BC are parts of the same line. But the problem says that Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are perpendicular. Which would imply that AB and BC are perpendicular, but if they are parts of the same line, they can't be. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are not the same as Line(A,C)? Wait, no. If B lies on Line(A,C), then Line(A,C) is the same as the union of Line(A,B) and Line(B,C). So if AB and BC are parts of the same line, then they cannot be perpendicular. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless... Oh, wait! Maybe the line AC is not the same as the line AB and BC? Wait, no. If B is on line AC, then line AB is part of line AC, and line BC is part of line AC. So AB and BC are colinear. Therefore, the statement that they are perpendicular contradicts. Therefore, there must be an error in my parsing of the predicates. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the Line(A,C) as being the same as the line AB and BC. Wait, but if B is on line AC, then line AC is the same as line AB extended beyond B to C. So, AB and BC are colinear. Therefore, the Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)) would not hold. So this seems like a conflict. How do we resolve this?

Wait, maybe the problem uses a different definition of Line(A,B). In some contexts, a line segment versus a line. But the predicates refer to Line(A,B), which typically denotes the infinite line containing points A and B. So if B is on line AC, then line AB is the same as line AC. So the lines AB and BC would be the same line, hence not perpendicular. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. So either there's a mistake in the problem setup, or my interpretation is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the Line(A,C) is not referring to the line through A and C, but another line? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps there's a typo in the problem? Or maybe I'm missing something else. Let me re-examine the given predicates.

Given that Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)). So Line AB is perpendicular to Line BC. But if point B lies on line AC, then lines AB and BC are parts of line AC. So they can't be perpendicular. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Let me check again.

Wait, could it be that Line(A,C) is not the same as Line(A,B) and Line(B,C)? Like, suppose that Line(A,C) is a different line, but the predicate says Point B lies on Line(A,C). Wait, but Line(A,C) is uniquely determined by points A and C. So if B lies on that line, then line AB and BC are parts of line AC. Hence, leading to the contradiction. So this seems like a paradox. Is there a way to reconcile this?

Wait, unless the lines AB and BC are not the same as line AC. But how? If B is on line AC, then lines AB and BC are subsets of line AC. Therefore, they are colinear. Therefore, the Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)) would be false. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the predicates.

Wait, maybe the Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are not the same as the line AC. Wait, but if B is on line AC, then Line AB is the same as line AC, and Line BC is the same as line AC. So they are the same line. Hence, they can't be perpendicular. Therefore, the given predicates seem inconsistent. But since the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps I need to re-express the problem differently.

Wait, maybe the Line(A,B) is not the same as the line AC. Wait, if B is on line AC, then line AC contains points A, B, and C. So Line AB is the same as line AC. But then, the Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)) would require that line AC is perpendicular to itself, which is impossible. So this suggests that the problem has conflicting information. However, since the problem is given, there must be a way to interpret it correctly. Perhaps there's a mistake in the way I'm interpreting the Line(A,C) predicate?

Alternatively, perhaps the PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C)) is not implying that B is on the line AC, but rather that B lies on the line segment AC? But the predicate says Line(A,C), which usually refers to the entire line, not the segment. However, sometimes in geometry problems, people might refer to the segment. If that's the case, then B is on segment AC, meaning that A---B---C are colinear with B between A and C. But even then, Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) would still be parts of the same line. So AB and BC are colinear, hence not perpendicular. So again, contradiction.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a different configuration where AB is perpendicular to BC, and B is on line AC. Wait, how? For example, if AB and BC are not colinear. Wait, but if B is on line AC, then AB and BC are colinear. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a typo, such as PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(A,B))? Or maybe the line is different? Or maybe the Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(C,D))? But according to the given, it's Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves three-dimensional geometry, but that's unlikely given the context of a fence around land, which is typically planar.

Alternatively, maybe there's a misinterpretation of the lines. Let me try to sketch the figure mentally.

We have points A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

Lines:

AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, FG, GE.

Also, FG is parallel to AB, and AB is length 5, FG is length 2.

Also, right angles at B and G.

So, starting with AB, which is 5 meters, and BC is 3 meters, with AB perpendicular to BC. So if we imagine point B, with AB going horizontally and BC going vertically upwards. Then, since AB is perpendicular to BC, and AB is length 5, BC is length 3. Now, point C is connected to D via CD, which has length y. Then D is connected to E via DE, which is length 2. Then E is connected to F via EF, which is length x. F is connected back to A via FA, which is length 1. Also, F is connected to G via FG (length 2), and G is connected to E via GE (length 2), with right angle at G. So FGE is a right triangle with legs 2 and 2, so FE is 2√2. Thus x is 2√2.

But then, what about point B lying on line AC? If AB is horizontal from A to B, and BC is vertical from B to C, then line AC would be the line from A to C, passing through B. But then, line AB is part of line AC, and line BC is also part of line AC. So AB and BC are colinear. But the problem states that AB is perpendicular to BC, which would mean they are not colinear. Hence, contradiction. Therefore, there's a problem here.

Wait, maybe the line AC is not the same as the line AB and BC? How? If point B is on line AC, then line AC must include points A, B, and C. So AB and BC are parts of line AC. Hence, they are colinear. Therefore, the perpendicularity condition can't hold. Therefore, this seems impossible. Therefore, maybe the original assumption that the figure is planar is incorrect? Or perhaps the problem has some non-planar elements? Or maybe there's a misinterpretation of the Line(A,C)?

Wait, maybe "PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C))" is not saying that B is on line AC, but that B lies on the line segment AC? If so, then line AC is a segment from A to C, with B somewhere in between. But then, Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) would be parts of line AC, hence colinear. Again, the same contradiction.

This seems like a dead end. Perhaps the problem has a typo, but assuming that it's intended to work, maybe I need to proceed under the assumption that despite the apparent contradiction, there's a way to reconcile it. Let me think differently.

Perhaps the line AC is not the same as the line AB and BC. For instance, if point B is on line AC, but line AC is not the same as line AB or BC? How? Well, line AC is defined by points A and C, regardless of where B is. If B is on line AC, then line AC includes B, so line AB is part of line AC, and line BC is part of line AC. So they are still colinear. Hence, the perpendicularity condition can't be satisfied. Therefore, this suggests that the given predicates are inconsistent. 

However, since the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps I need to overlook this inconsistency and proceed with the other information, assuming that the figure is constructed in a way that allows AB and BC to be perpendicular despite B lying on line AC. How is that possible?

Wait, perhaps the line AC is not a straight line? But in standard geometry, lines are straight. So this seems impossible. Alternatively, maybe there's a reflection or some other transformation. Alternatively, maybe the points are arranged in 3D space, allowing AB and BC to be perpendicular while B lies on line AC. But that would complicate things further, and the problem likely assumes a 2D plane.

Alternatively, maybe the line AC is not a straight line? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about Euclidean geometry? Unlikely. 

Alternatively, maybe the Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(B,C)) is not referring to the actual lines, but to the segments? But even then, if B is on line AC, then segments AB and BC are parts of the same line, hence colinear, not perpendicular. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to focus on the parts that don't involve this contradiction. For example, the right angles at B and G, and the parallelism between AB and FG. 

Since AB is perpendicular to BC, and FG is parallel to AB, then FG is also perpendicular to BC. Wait, no. If AB is perpendicular to BC, and FG is parallel to AB, then FG is also perpendicular to BC. But in the case of the right angle at G, FG is connected to GE, which is perpendicular to FG. So FG is perpendicular to GE. So GE is parallel to BC? Because FG is perpendicular to BC (since FG || AB, which is perpendicular to BC), and FG is also perpendicular to GE. Hence, GE is parallel to BC. 

So GE || BC. Given that GE is length 2, and BC is length 3. 

Also, since FG is parallel to AB, and AB is length 5, FG is length 2. 

Now, looking at the triangle FGE, which is a right triangle with legs FG=2 and GE=2, so FE=x=2√2 as before. 

Now, moving to the other part of the figure. We have line DE with length 2 (ED=2), and CD with length y. What about the rest? 

We have line CD connected to D, which is connected to E. So D-E is length 2, and C-D is length y. 

What about point C? It's connected to B via BC (length 3), and to D via CD (length y). 

If we can find relations involving these lengths. 

Also, since we have AB = 5, BC = 3, and AB ⊥ BC, then triangle ABC is a right triangle with legs 5 and 3, so AC would be sqrt(5² + 3²) = sqrt(34). But since point B lies on line AC, which suggests that AC is the hypotenuse of this right triangle. However, if B is on AC, then AB + BC = AC. Wait, but AB is 5, BC is 3, so AC would be 8. But sqrt(34) ≈ 5.830..., which conflicts with AC being 8. Hence, contradiction again. 

Therefore, this suggests that there's an inconsistency in the given predicates. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, perhaps the issue is with my assumption about the position of point B. 

Maybe the line AC is not the straight line through A and C, but something else? No, that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, perhaps the line AC is not a straight line, but that's not standard. 

Alternatively, perhaps the PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C)) is not implying that B is on the line AC, but that B lies on the line segment AC? Even then, the previous contradictions remain. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in 3D, with line AC being a skew line? No, that complicates things further. 

At this point, I think the best course of action is to proceed with the information that does not involve the contradiction, and see if we can derive the required lengths. 

So, ignoring the contradiction about B being on line AC, let's assume that AB is perpendicular to BC, and BC is length 3, AB is length 5. Then, the coordinates might be set as follows: Let’s assign coordinates to the points to model this. Let me place point B at the origin (0,0). Since AB is perpendicular to BC, let's take AB along the y-axis and BC along the x-axis. So:

- Point B is at (0,0).
- Since AB is length 5 and perpendicular to BC, let's say AB goes from B(0,0) up to A(0,5). 
- BC goes from B(0,0) to C(3,0), since BC is length 3.

Now, point C is at (3,0). Then, CD is connected to D. Let me denote D as some point. The line CD has length y. Then, D is connected to E, with DE length 2. Then, E is connected to F, with EF length x, and F connected back to A(0,5). Also, FG is connected to G, and GE is connected to E, with FG parallel to AB (which is vertical, since AB is from (0,0) to (0,5)), so FG must also be vertical. Also, GE is length 2, and the right angle at G implies that FG is perpendicular to GE. Since FG is vertical, GE must be horizontal. So from point G, moving horizontally to E. 

Let me try to map this. 

First, let's define coordinates:

- B: (0,0)
- A: (0,5)
- C: (3,0)

Now, CD is connected to D. Let me assume D is at some coordinate. Since DE is length 2, and D is connected to E. Let me denote E as a point such that DE = 2. Also, E is connected to F, then to A. Also, FG is vertical (parallel to AB), and GE is horizontal (since FG is vertical and GE is perpendicular to FG).

Let me try to find coordinates for E and F. 

Assume that from point G, which is connected to F and E. Since FG is vertical, and GE is horizontal. Let me denote G as (p, q). Since FG is vertical, F must be directly above or below G. Let's assume F is directly above G since it connects to A(0,5). Let's suppose F is at (p, q + k), where k is the length of FG. But the length of FG is given as 2. So FG = 2, so the distance between F and G is 2. Since FG is vertical, the x-coordinate of F and G is the same. Let's say G is at (p, r), then F is at (p, r ± 2). 

Also, GE is horizontal, so from G(p,r) to E, which is horizontal. So E has the same y-coordinate as G, i.e., E is at (s, r), where s ≠ p. 

Since E is connected to F and to D. Let's try to express this. 

E is connected to D via DE = 2. So D is some point such that the distance between D and E is 2. Also, D is connected to C(3,0) via CD = y. So D lies somewhere such that its distance from C(3,0) is y, and its distance from E(s, r) is 2. 

Additionally, F is connected to A(0,5). So the distance between F(p, r ± 2) and A(0,5) is the length of FA, which is given as 1. 

So, FA = 1. So, if F is at (p, r + 2), then distance from F to A(0,5) is sqrt((p - 0)^2 + (r + 2 - 5)^2) = sqrt(p² + (r - 3)^2) = 1. So p² + (r - 3)^2 = 1. 

Also, since E is connected to F via EF, which has length x. So distance between E(s, r) and F(p, r + 2) is x. So sqrt((s - p)^2 + (r - (r + 2))^2) = sqrt((s - p)^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt((s-p)^2 + 4) = x. 

Also, GE is horizontal, so from G(p, r) to E(s, r), which is length |s - p| = 2 (since GE is length 2). Wait, the problem says Equals(LengthOf(Line(G,E)),2), so GE = 2. Therefore, |s - p| = 2 => s = p + 2 or s = p - 2. 

So, s = p ± 2. 

Thus, the distance between E(s, r) and F(p, r + 2) is sqrt((±2)^2 + (-2)^2) = sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8) = 2√2. Hence, x = 2√2. So that resolves x. 

Now, we also know that E is connected to D via DE = 2. So, D is a point such that distance from D to E(s, r) is 2. Also, D is connected to C(3,0) via CD = y. 

Let me attempt to find coordinates for D. Let me assume that D is somewhere such that it's at distance y from C(3,0) and at distance 2 from E(s, r). 

But without knowing s and r, it's hard to determine. However, perhaps we can relate this to other parts. 

Also, since D is connected to C(3,0), and we have CD = y. 

But how to connect this with other parts? Let me think about the entire figure. 

We also have the line from D to E, which is length 2. So, once we know E's coordinates, we can find D's coordinates. But without more info, it's challenging. 

However, maybe there's another relationship. Let me recall that the figure is closed, so after E-F-A, we return to A. But we also have the line from F to G, and G to E. 

Wait, perhaps we can find coordinates for G and F. 

From earlier, we had that for F(p, r + 2), distance to A(0,5) is 1: p² + (r - 3)^2 = 1. 

Also, since FG is vertical and GE is horizontal, and GE is length 2. 

Now, let's try to find p and r. 

But we need more equations. Let's think about the connection between D and E. 

Suppose we can find coordinates for E(s, r). From earlier, s = p ± 2. 

But we need to relate this to D. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's another constraint. For instance, since the entire figure is connected, maybe there's a relation between D and other points? 

Alternatively, since we have point D connected to C(3,0), and D connected to E(s, r), with DE = 2. So, the locus of D is the intersection of two circles: one centered at C(3,0) with radius y, and one centered at E(s, r) with radius 2. 

But without knowing y or s and r, it's difficult. However, perhaps there's a way to relate this to other parts of the figure. 

Wait, let's consider the line from D to E. Since DE = 2, and E is connected to F and G. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to find coordinates for E. Let's assume that E is connected to F, which is connected to A. So, E is connected to F, which is at (p, r + 2), and E is at (s, r). Also, from earlier, s = p ± 2. 

But without additional constraints, we can't determine p and r. However, we might have another equation from the fact that point D is connected to C(3,0) and to E(s, r). 

But since we don't know y, which is CD, perhaps there's a way to express y in terms of other variables. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a relationship between y and other lengths through the overall structure. 

But I'm stuck here. Let me try to summarize what I know:

- x = 2√2 (from earlier)
- Need to find y (length CD)
- The rest of the figure needs to be consistent with AB=5, BC=3, FG=2, GE=2, FA=1, DE=2, and the right angles.

Maybe I can find y by considering the coordinates of D. Let me assume that D is connected to C(3,0) and to E(s, r), with DE=2. 

Let me pick specific values for p and r that satisfy the FA condition. For example, since p² + (r - 3)^2 = 1, we can choose p and r such that this holds. Let's choose simple values. For example, if r = 3, then p² = 1 ⇒ p = ±1. Let's choose p = 1, r = 3. So F is at (1, 3 + 2) = (1,5). Wait, but point A is at (0,5). So distance between F(1,5) and A(0,5) is 1, which matches FA=1. Great!

So, with p=1, r=3:

- G is at (1, 3)
- F is at (1, 5) (since FG is vertical from G(1,3) to F(1,5), which is length 2)
- GE is horizontal from G(1,3) to E(s,3), with length 2. So s = 1 ± 2 ⇒ s = 3 or s = -1. 

Let's choose s = 3 (assuming E is to the right of G). So E is at (3,3). 

Now, DE = 2. D is connected to E(3,3) and to C(3,0). So D is a point such that it is 2 units away from E(3,3) and y units away from C(3,0). 

So, the distance between D and C(3,0) is y, and the distance between D and E(3,3) is 2. 

Let me find the coordinates of D. 

Let D = (x, y). 

Distance from D to E(3,3): √[(x-3)^2 + (y-3)^2] = 2 → (x-3)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 4.

Distance from D to C(3,0): √[(x-3)^2 + (y-0)^2] = y → (x-3)^2 + y² = y² → (x-3)^2 = 0 → x = 3. 

So x = 3, which means D is at (3, y), where y satisfies (3-3)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 4 → 0 + (y-3)^2 = 4 → y-3 = ±2 → y = 5 or y = 1. 

So D is at (3,5) or (3,1). 

Now, since D is connected to E(3,3), let's check both possibilities. 

Case 1: D is at (3,5). Then, CD is the distance from C(3,0) to D(3,5), which is 5 units. So y = 5. 

Case 2: D is at (3,1). Then, CD is the distance from C(3,0) to D(3,1), which is 1 unit. So y = 1. 

Which one is correct? Let's see if there are other constraints. 

Looking back at the figure, we have line CD connected to D, which is connected to E(3,3). If D is at (3,5), then CD is vertical from (3,0) to (3,5), and DE is from (3,5) to (3,3), which is length 2, matching DE=2. 

If D is at (3,1), then CD is from (3,0) to (3,1), length 1, and DE is from (3,1) to (3,3), length 2. Both cases are valid. 

But which one fits the overall figure? Let's check if there are any other constraints. 

Recall that we have point B at (0,0), A at (0,5), C at (3,0). Now, what about the line from D to E? If D is at (3,5), then DE goes from (3,5) to (3,3), which is vertical downward. If D is at (3,1), DE goes from (3,1) to (3,3), upward. Either way, it's fine. 

But how do we decide between the two options? Let me check if there are other points or lines that might affect this. 

For example, what about the line from D to E? If D is at (3,5), then E is at (3,3), and D is at (3,5). But then, what about the rest of the figure? 

Alternatively, maybe there's a constraint from the fact that PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C)). Wait, in our coordinate system, Line(A,C) is from A(0,5) to C(3,0). Does point B(0,0) lie on this line? Let's check. 

The line from A(0,5) to C(3,0) has slope (0-5)/(3-0) = -5/3. The equation is y - 5 = -5/3 (x - 0), so y = -5/3 x + 5. Plugging in x=0 gives y=5 (point A), x=3 gives y=0 (point C). Does point B(0,0) lie on this line? At x=0, y=5, so no. So B is not on line AC. But the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C)), which would mean that B is on line AC. But in this scenario, it's not. Hence, contradiction. 

Ah! Here's the crux. Earlier, we assumed that the contradiction was due to AB and BC being colinear, but now, with this coordinate setup, B is not on line AC, which violates the given predicate. 

So, this suggests that our choice of coordinates is invalid. Hence, we need to adjust our assumptions. 

How can we ensure that point B lies on line AC? 

In our current setup, point B is at (0,0), and line AC is from (0,5) to (3,0). To have B on this line, the coordinates must satisfy the line equation. 

Let me recalculate: Line AC passes through A(0,5) and C(3,0). Its equation is y = -5/3 x + 5. For point B(0,0) to be on this line, plugging x=0 gives y=5, which is not 0. Hence, B is not on this line. 

Therefore, to satisfy the predicate PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C)), point B must lie on line AC. So, in our coordinate system, B must be on line AC. 

Let me adjust the coordinates accordingly. Let's redefine the coordinates to satisfy this condition. 

Let me assume that line AC contains point B(0,0). Let me define points A and C such that B is on line AC. Let me choose coordinates such that line AC passes through B(0,0). Let me set A at (a, b) and C at (c, d), such that B(0,0) lies on line AC. 

But this adds complexity. Let me try to parameterize it. Let me assume that line AC passes through B(0,0). Let me set A at (0, k) and C at (m, n), such that B(0,0) is on line AC. 

But since AB is perpendicular to BC, and AB and BC are parts of line AC, this seems impossible. Wait, but if B is on line AC, then AB and BC are colinear, contradicting the perpendicularity. 

This brings us back to the initial contradiction. Therefore, the given predicates seem to be inconsistent, but since the problem is posed, there must be a way. 

Perhaps the error is in assuming that AB and BC are both parts of the same line. Maybe the lines AB and BC are not the same as line AC, but instead, line AC is a different line? No, line AC is defined by points A and C. If B is on line AC, it must be part of it. 

At this point, I think the problem may have a typo, or I'm missing a crucial insight. Given the time I've spent and the need to proceed, I'll proceed with the earlier calculation where x = 2√2, and for y, assuming that in the coordinate system where D is at (3,5) giving y=5, even though it doesn't satisfy the PointLiesOnLine predicate. 

But since the problem requires solving it, I'll proceed with the assumption that y = 5, giving total perimeter as AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 2√2 + 1 = 16 + 2√2. Multiply by 37 to get the cost. 

But wait, if y=5, then CD is 5. But let me verify with the coordinates where D is at (3,5), which gives CD = 5. 

Alternatively, if D is at (3,1), then y=1. But then, what about the rest of the figure? Let me check if there are any constraints on y. 

If D is at (3,1), then CD is 1, DE is 2, so total for those parts is 1 + 2 = 3. 

But without more info, it's hard to tell. However, since the problem asks for the cost based on x and y, and we have x = 2√2, and y is either 1 or 5, depending on D's position. 

But how to determine y? 

Let me think about the line from D to E. In the case where D is at (3,5), then DE is from (3,5) to (3,3), which is vertical down, length 2. In this case, CD is from (3,0) to (3,5), length 5. 

Alternatively, if D is at (3,1), DE is from (3,1) to (3,3), length 2, and CD is from (3,0) to (3,1), length 1. 

Which one is correct? Let me check if there are any other constraints. 

Looking back at the lines: Line(C,D) is CD, Line(D,E) is DE, Line(E,F) is EF, Line(F,A) is FA, Line(A,B) is AB, Line(B,C) is BC, Line(F,G) is FG, Line(G,E) is GE. 

If D is at (3,5), then line CD is from C(3,0) to D(3,5), which is vertical. Line DE is from D(3,5) to E(3,3), which is vertical. So both CD and DE are vertical lines. 

If D is at (3,1), line CD is from C(3,0) to D(3,1), vertical, and DE is from D(3,1) to E(3,3), vertical. 

Either way, both scenarios are possible. 

But since the problem mentions a fence around the entire perimeter, it's possible that the figure is convex or has no overlapping lines. Without more information, it's hard to choose between y=1 or y=5. 

However, let's consider the total perimeter. If y=5, then total perimeter is 5 (AB) + 3 (BC) + 5 (CD) + 2 (DE) + 2√2 (EF) + 1 (FA) = 16 + 2√2. If y=1, it's 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2√2 + 1 = 12 + 2√2. 

But how to determine which one is correct? 

Wait, in the case where D is at (3,5), the line from D(3,5) to E(3,3) is part of the same vertical line as CD. But what about the rest of the figure? Let me check if there are any other lines or constraints. 

For example, in this case, point D is at (3,5), which is vertically above C(3,0). Then, line CD is vertical, DE is vertical. 

But what about the line from D to E? It's part of the same vertical line. 

Alternatively, if D is at (3,1), then CD is vertical from (3,0) to (3,1), and DE is vertical from (3,1) to (3,3). 

Both are possible. 

Without additional constraints, it's ambiguous. However, since the problem includes the predicate PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C)), which we couldn't satisfy in our previous setups, perhaps there's another way to arrange the points. 

Let me try a different approach. Let's forget about coordinates and use vectors or other methods. 

Given that AB is perpendicular to BC, and AB = 5, BC = 3. Let me consider AB and BC as vectors. Let vector AB = (0,5), vector BC = (3,0), so they are perpendicular. 

Now, point C is at B + BC = (0,0) + (3,0) = (3,0). 

Now, point D is such that CD = y, and DE = 2. Let me assume that from point C(3,0), we move to D, then to E. 

But without knowing direction, it's hard to say. 

But if we consider the line DE = 2, and E is connected to F, which is connected to A(0,5). 

Earlier, we found that x = 2√2. 

Assuming that y is 5 or 1, but how to determine? 

Wait, in the case where D is at (3,5), then CD is 5, and DE is 2. In this case, the total perimeter would be 5 + 3 + 5 + 2 + 2√2 + 1 = 16 + 2√2. 

If y=1, it's 5 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2√2 + 1 = 12 + 2√2. 

But without more information, it's impossible to know. However, perhaps there's a way to use the fact that PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,C)). 

Let me revisit this. If B is on line AC, then in our coordinate system, line AC must pass through B(0,0). Let me redefine the coordinates to satisfy this. 

Let me set A at (0, a), C at (c, 0), so that line AC passes through B(0,0). The line AC would go from A(0,a) to C(c,0), passing through B(0,0). Wait, but if B is on line AC, then B must be between A and C or extend beyond. 

Let me choose A at (0,5), C at (3,0), so line AC is from (0,5) to (3,0). This line passes through B(0,0)? No, as previously calculated. 

Wait, if I want B(0,0) to be on line AC, then the line AC must pass through (0,0). Let me choose A at (0, k) and C at (m, 0), such that the line from A to C passes through B(0,0). 

The line from A(0,k) to C(m,0) has equation y = (-k/m)x + k. For this line to pass through B(0,0), substitute x=0, y=0: 0 = (-k/m)*0 + k ⇒ k = 0. But then A would be at (0,0), same as B, which is not allowed. Hence, it's impossible to have B on line AC unless A or C is at B, which is not the case. 

This confirms the earlier contradiction: if B is on line AC, then AB and BC are colinear, making them unable to be perpendicular. Hence, the given predicates are inconsistent. 

Given this, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the predicate should be PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(A,B)) or something else. Assuming that, or that the perpendicularity is between AB and CD, but that's speculation. 

Since I need to provide an answer, and given that in the earlier calculation with D at (3,5), y=5, and x=2√2, let's proceed with that, acknowledging the inconsistency. 

Total perimeter would be AB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 5 +
