QUESTION:
A pyramid has been removed from a rectangular prism, as shown in the figure. The height of the rectangular prism is 8cm, its length and width are 15cm and 9cm respectively. Find the volume of this composite solid.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the volume of a composite solid that's formed by removing a pyramid from a rectangular prism. The given dimensions are a height of 8 cm, length of 15 cm, and width of 9 cm. 

Let me start by recalling the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism. It's simply length × width × height. So plugging in the numbers, that would be 15 cm × 9 cm × 8 cm. Let me calculate that real quick. 15 times 9 is 135, and then multiplied by 8 gives 1080 cm³. That's the volume of the original prism before the pyramid is removed.

Now, the tricky part is figuring out the volume of the pyramid that was removed so I can subtract it from the prism's volume to get the composite solid's volume. To find the volume of a pyramid, the formula is (1/3) × base area × height. But wait, I need to know the base area and the height of the pyramid. 

Looking at the problem, there's mention of a pyramid being removed. From the given predicates, there are several rectangles and lines described. Let me parse through those. There's a Rectangle(A,B,C,D) with LengthOf(A,B)=15, LengthOf(B,C)=9, etc. Then another rectangle E,F,G,H with similar lengths but different points. Also, there are perpendicular lines mentioned, like Perpendicular(Line(A,B),Line(A,E)), which suggests that Line AE is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is part of the base of the prism (assuming A, B, C, D form the base), then AE would be vertical, making E a point extending upwards from A, possibly forming the apex of the pyramid?

Wait, maybe the pyramid is attached to one corner of the prism? Let me visualize. If we have a rectangular prism, and a pyramid is removed, perhaps it's a square pyramid? Or maybe a triangular pyramid? The problem mentions that the height of the prism is 8 cm, which matches the LengthOf(A,E) = 8 cm. Wait, looking back at the predicates, there's LengthOf(A,E) = 8 cm. Similarly, other edges like B,F, C,G, D,H also have LengthOf=8 cm. This suggests that each of these points E, F, G, H are connected to their respective corners of the prism with segments of length 8 cm. 

But how does this relate to the pyramid? Maybe the pyramid has a base that's a face of the prism and the apex at some point. Alternatively, since the height of the prism is 8 cm, perhaps the pyramid's height is 8 cm. However, if the pyramid is removed from the prism, then the height of the pyramid might be the same as the prism's height? But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again.

Alternatively, considering the predicates, there are two rectangles: one ABCD with sides 15 and 9, and another EFGH with the same side lengths. Also, lines connecting A to E, B to F, etc., are all perpendicular. So maybe the second rectangle EFGH is connected to the first rectangle ABCD via these perpendicular lines. Given that the prism's height is 8 cm, and the length of AE is 8 cm, that suggests that E is directly above A, and similarly for F, G, H. Therefore, the figure might be a combination of two prisms or something else. But the problem says a pyramid is removed from the prism. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the pyramid is a tetrahedron? Because a pyramid with a triangular base. But the problem states "a pyramid," which could be any base. However, without more details, I need to infer from the given data. Let me check the predicates again. 

There are several IsSideOf predicates involving Triangle(E,F,Y), Triangle(E,H,Z), etc. These might indicate that certain lines are sides of triangles. For example, IsSideOf(Line(E,X),Triangle(E,F,Y)) suggests that Line(E,X) is a side of triangle E,F,Y. Similarly for others. Also, Equals(LengthOf(E,X),Div(LengthOf(E,F),2)). So the length of E,X is half the length of E,F. Since E,F is part of the rectangle EFGH, which has LengthOf(E,F)=15 cm. Therefore, LengthOf(E,X) would be 15/2 = 7.5 cm. Similarly, Equals(LengthOf(E,Z),Div(LengthOf(E,H),2)). Since E,H is 9 cm (from LengthOf(E,H)=9?), Wait, no. Wait, looking back, the rectangle EFGH has LengthOf(E,F)=15, LengthOf(F,G)=9, LengthOf(G,H)=15, LengthOf(H,E)=9. So E,F is 15 cm, F,G is 9 cm, etc. So E,H is a diagonal? No, because in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. Wait, EFGH is a rectangle, so EF and GH are 15 cm, FG and HE are 9 cm. So the sides of the rectangle EFGH are 15 and 9 cm. 

Then, the line EH is 9 cm. So Div(LengthOf(E,H),2) would be 9/2 = 4.5 cm. So the length of E,Z is 4.5 cm. 

These might be indicating midpoints. For instance, X and Z are midpoints of EF and EH respectively. So, if E,X is half of EF, then X is the midpoint of EF, and similarly Z is the midpoint of EH. 

So, considering that, maybe the pyramid is formed by connecting these midpoints? Or perhaps the apex of the pyramid is at the intersection of these lines? Wait, but the problem says a pyramid is removed from the prism. So perhaps the base of the pyramid is a face of the prism, and the apex is somewhere inside. 

Alternatively, since there are perpendicular lines from each corner of the prism (like A-E, B-F, etc.), and those lines are all 8 cm long. So if you imagine the prism standing on its base ABCD, then each of the points E, F, G, H are vertically above A, B, C, D respectively, each 8 cm up. Then, connecting these points might form another shape. But the problem says a pyramid is removed. 

Wait, if we take the entire prism and remove a pyramid whose base is one of the faces and whose apex is at a point inside the prism. For example, suppose the base is the top face of the prism, and the apex is at a point inside. But the height of the prism is 8 cm. But the height of the pyramid would depend on where the apex is located. 

However, given the predicates, there's a lot about perpendicular lines. Let me try to reconstruct the figure. 

The first rectangle ABCD has AB=15 cm, BC=9 cm. Then, the second rectangle EFGH has EF=15 cm, FG=9 cm. Lines AE, BF, CG, DH are all perpendicular to their respective sides of the rectangle ABCD. For example, AE is perpendicular to AB, BF is perpendicular to BC, etc. Since AB is horizontal (assuming standard orientation), then AE would be vertical. Similarly, BF is perpendicular to BC, which would mean BF is going upward from B, but since BC is vertical (if ABCD is a rectangle), then BF would be horizontal? Wait, no. Wait, in rectangle ABCD, AB and CD are length 15 cm, BC and AD are 9 cm. So AB is adjacent to BC. So AB is horizontal, BC is vertical. Then, the line AE is perpendicular to AB, so AE is vertical. Similarly, BF is perpendicular to BC, which is vertical, so BF would be horizontal. Wait, but BF starts at B and is perpendicular to BC. Since BC is vertical, then BF would be horizontal. But in that case, BF would be along the direction of BA or BD? Not sure. Maybe the coordinates can help here. 

Let me assign coordinates to the points to make this clearer. Let's assume point A is at the origin (0, 0, 0). Since AB is 15 cm, and assuming AB is along the x-axis, then point B would be at (15, 0, 0). Point C, since BC is 9 cm and perpendicular to AB, would be at (15, 9, 0). Then point D would be at (0, 9, 0). Now, the height of the prism is 8 cm, so the vertical axis is z. The lines AE, BF, CG, DH are perpendicular to their respective sides. 

For example, AE is perpendicular to AB. Since AB is along the x-axis, AE would be along the z-axis. So point E would be straight up from A, so E would be at (0, 0, 8). Similarly, BF is perpendicular to BC. BC goes from B(15,0,0) to C(15,9,0), so BC is along the y-axis. Therefore, BF should be perpendicular to BC, which means BF is along the z-axis. Wait, but starting at B(15,0,0), moving perpendicularly to BC (which is in y-direction) would mean BF is along the z-axis. So point F would be at (15, 0, 8)? Wait, but earlier we had LengthOf(B,F)=8 cm. Which matches, since distance from B(15,0,0) to F(15,0,8) is sqrt((0)^2 + (0)^2 + (8)^2) = 8 cm. Similarly, CG is perpendicular to CD. CD goes from C(15,9,0) to D(0,9,0), so CD is along the negative x-axis. Perpendicular to CD would be along the z-axis. So point G is at (15,9,8). And DH is perpendicular to DA. DA goes from D(0,9,0) to A(0,0,0), which is along the negative y-axis. So DH should be along the z-axis. Hence, point H is at (0,9,8).

So now we have points E(0,0,8), F(15,0,8), G(15,9,8), H(0,9,8). Connecting these forms a rectangle EFGH, which is the top face of the prism, since all z-coordinates are 8. Wait, but the original prism's height is 8 cm, so the top face is indeed at z=8. So the prism is defined by the points A(0,0,0), B(15,0,0), C(15,9,0), D(0,9,0), and the top points E, F, G, H as above. 

Now, the problem says a pyramid has been removed from the prism. The question is to find the volume of the composite solid after removal. So the original volume is the prism minus the volume of the removed pyramid. 

But where is the pyramid located? The problem mentions that there are triangles involved, such as IsSideOf(Line(E,X),Triangle(E,F,Y)), etc. Also, there are midpoints. Earlier, we saw that E,X is half of EF. Since EF is 15 cm, then EX = 7.5 cm. So X is the midpoint of EF. Similarly, Z is the midpoint of EH, which is 9 cm, so EZ = 4.5 cm. 

If we consider the triangle E,F,Y, and the line E,X is a side of it. Assuming Y is another point. Wait, maybe the pyramid is formed by connecting these midpoints? Let me see. 

Suppose the pyramid has a base that is a triangle or quadrilateral, and an apex. For example, if we take the triangle E,F,Y, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering the IsSideOf predicates, maybe the pyramid is a tetrahedron with vertices at E, F, G, and some point? 

Alternatively, since there's a triangle E,H,Z mentioned, with Z being the midpoint of EH. Let me think. If we connect midpoints of edges of the prism, maybe the pyramid is formed by connecting these midpoints. For example, if we take midpoints of EF, EH, etc., and form a pyramid with them. 

Alternatively, perhaps the pyramid is formed by connecting the apex at E to the base triangle FGH? Wait, but that would be a tetrahedron. Let me think. Suppose the pyramid is a tetrahedron with base triangle FGH and apex at E. Then its volume would be (1/3)*base_area*height. The base area would be the area of triangle FGH. But F, G, H are points on the top face of the prism. Wait, but F is (15,0,8), G is (15,9,8), H is (0,9,8). So triangle FGH would be a right triangle with legs of length 15 cm (from F to G is 9 cm in y-direction? Wait, no. Wait, coordinates:

F is (15,0,8), G is (15,9,8), H is (0,9,8). So FG is from (15,0,8) to (15,9,8): this is a vertical line segment of length 9 cm. GH is from (15,9,8) to (0,9,8): horizontal line segment of length 15 cm. Then HF is from (0,9,8) to (15,0,8): this is a diagonal. Wait, but triangle FGH would actually be a right triangle with legs FG=9 cm and GH=15 cm? Wait, no, because FH connects H(0,9,8) to F(15,0,8), which isn't aligned with the axes. Wait, but if we take points F, G, H, they form a right triangle? Let me check. 

Point F is (15,0,8), G is (15,9,8), H is (0,9,8). So FG is vertical, GH is horizontal leftward, and HF is the hypotenuse. So triangle FGH is a right triangle with legs of 9 cm (FG) and 15 cm (GH). Wait, but GH is from G(15,9,8) to H(0,9,8), which is 15 units in the x-direction, yes. So the base of the triangle FGH is 15 cm, height is 9 cm. The area of this triangle would be (15*9)/2 = 67.5 cm². Then, if the apex of the pyramid is at E(0,0,8), then the height of the pyramid would be the distance from E to the plane containing F, G, H. Wait, but E is at (0,0,8), and the plane of FGH is at z=8. So all points are on the same plane (z=8), so the height would be zero, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, that can't be the case. 

Hmm, maybe the apex is not at E, but somewhere else. Wait, the problem says a pyramid is removed from the prism. Perhaps the apex is at a point inside the prism? Let me think again. 

Looking back at the predicates, there's also IsSideOf(Line(E,Z),Triangle(E,H,Z)). So Line(E,Z) is a side of triangle E,H,Z. And LengthOf(E,Z) is half of LengthOf(E,H), which is 9 cm, so 4.5 cm. So Z is the midpoint of EH. EH is from E(0,0,8) to H(0,9,8), so midpoint Z would be at (0, 4.5, 8). Similarly, X is the midpoint of EF, which is from E(0,0,8) to F(15,0,8), so midpoint X is at (7.5, 0, 8). 

Maybe the pyramid is formed by connecting these midpoints? Like, if we take points X, Z, and others? Wait, the IsSideOf predicates involve triangles like Triangle(E,F,Y), Triangle(E,H,Z), etc. Maybe the pyramid has a base that is a triangle involving these midpoints. 

Alternatively, since there are multiple triangles mentioned, perhaps the pyramid is a three-dimensional figure formed by connecting these midpoints. For instance, if we consider triangle E,F,Y where Y is another point. Wait, but I need more concrete info. 

Alternatively, think about the fact that the problem involves a pyramid removed from the prism, and the height of the prism is 8 cm. If the pyramid's height is the same as the prism's height, then the volume of the pyramid would be (1/3)*base_area*height. But what is the base? 

Wait, maybe the base of the pyramid is a triangle on the top face of the prism. For example, taking triangle EFG as the base. But EFG is part of the rectangle EFGH, so it's a right triangle. The area would be (EF * FG)/2 = (15*9)/2 = 67.5 cm². Then, the height of the pyramid would be the distance from the apex to this base. But where is the apex? 

Wait, if the apex is at point D, which is (0,9,0), but that would be outside the prism. Wait, but the prism extends from z=0 to z=8. If the apex is at D, then the height would be the vertical distance from D to the base, which is... but D is at z=0, while the base is at z=8. So the height would be 8 cm. Then the volume would be (1/3)*67.5*8 = 180 cm³. Subtracting that from the prism's volume of 1080 cm³ gives 1080 - 180 = 900 cm³. But I don't know if this is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the apex is at the center of the prism. The center of the prism would be at (7.5, 4.5, 4). If the base is the top face, then the height would be from the center to the top face, which is 4 cm. Then volume of pyramid would be (1/3)*(area of top face)*height. The top face area is 15*9=135 cm². Height is 4 cm. Volume would be (1/3)*135*4 = 180 cm³. Same result as before. So regardless of where the apex is, if the base is the top face and the height is 4 cm, the volume would be same? Wait, no. Wait, if the apex is at the center, the height is 4 cm. If the apex is at another point, say, the bottom face, then height would be 8 cm. 

But how do I determine where the apex is? The problem mentions that the pyramid is removed from the prism, but without a diagram, it's challenging. However, the given predicates include several IsSideOf statements and midpoints. 

Another thought: since there are midpoints involved, maybe the pyramid is a regular pyramid with base as a rectangle and apex at the center. But the problem states it's a pyramid, not necessarily regular. 

Wait, looking back at the IsSideOf(Line(E,X),Triangle(E,F,Y))—this suggests that Line(E,X) is a side of triangle E,F,Y. If X is the midpoint of EF, then Y could be another point. Maybe Y is the midpoint of something else? For example, if Y is the midpoint of FG, then the triangle E,F,Y would have vertices at E, F, and midpoint of FG. 

But without knowing exactly what Y is, it's hard to tell. However, the problem may be implying that the pyramid is a tetrahedron with base triangle E,F,Y and apex at another point. But this is getting too vague. 

Perhaps I need to focus on the fact that the height of the prism is 8 cm, and the pyramid's height is determined by the given data. Let me recall that in the predicates, there's a Perpendicular(Line(A,B),Line(A,E)), which indicates that AE is perpendicular to AB. As we assigned earlier, AE is vertical. Similarly, other lines are perpendicular. 

Now, considering the pyramids' height. If the pyramid is such that its base is a face of the prism and its apex is at a point where the perpendicular lines meet. For example, if the base is the top face EFGH and the apex is at the origin point A(0,0,0). Then the height of the pyramid would be the distance from A to the plane of EFGH, which is 8 cm. Then volume would be (1/3)*area_of_top_face*height. The top face area is 15*9=135 cm². Volume is (1/3)*135*8 = 360 cm³. Then total volume of composite solid would be 1080 - 360 = 720 cm³. 

But why would the apex be at A? Because AE is perpendicular to AB, and the line AE is part of the prism. However, if the pyramid is removed, it's possible that it's a smaller pyramid. 

Alternatively, maybe the pyramid is formed by connecting the midpoints. For example, if we take the midpoints X, Z, and others. Let me think. 

Earlier, we found that X is midpoint of EF at (7.5, 0, 8), Z is midpoint of EH at (0, 4.5, 8). Also, there's a midpoint of FG, which would be at (15, 4.5, 8), and midpoint of GH at (7.5, 9, 8). These midpoints could form a smaller rectangle inside EFGH. If we connect these midpoints, we get a smaller rectangle. But how does that relate to the pyramid? 

Alternatively, the pyramid could be formed by connecting the midpoints of the edges of the prism. For example, connecting midpoints of AB, BC, CD, DA, and the corresponding points on the top face. But again, unclear. 

Wait, maybe the pyramid is a square pyramid with base as the top face EFGH and apex at the midpoint of the prism. The midpoint of the prism would be at (7.5, 4.5, 4). The height of the pyramid would then be from this apex to the top face, which is 4 cm. So volume would be (1/3)*135*4 = 180 cm³. Thus, the composite volume would be 1080 - 180 = 900 cm³. 

But how do I confirm which pyramid is being removed? The problem statement mentions "as shown in the figure," but since there's no figure, I have to rely on the given predicates. 

Another clue is the presence of the IsSideOf(Line(E,X),Triangle(E,F,Y)) and similar statements. This suggests that there is a triangle E,F,Y where E,X is a side. If X is the midpoint of EF, then Line(E,X) is part of the triangle. So maybe the triangle is E,F,X, making it a degenerate triangle? No, because X is on EF, so the triangle would collapse. That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe Y is another point. For example, if Y is the midpoint of FG, then Line(E,X) is a side of triangle E,F,Y. But I need to think differently. 

Alternatively, the triangle E,F,Y might be a triangle where Y is a new point. But without more info, it's hard to proceed. 

Let me switch gears. Since the problem gives us all the lengths and perpendicularity, perhaps the pyramid is a right pyramid with a square base. But the base of the prism is a rectangle, not a square. 

Alternatively, since the height of the prism is 8 cm, and the length and width are 15 and 9 cm, the volume of the prism is 15×9×8 = 1080 cm³ as calculated earlier. Now, the question is about the volume of the composite solid after removing a pyramid. Without knowing the specifics of the pyramid, it's difficult, but maybe there's enough info in the predicates to deduce it. 

Wait, the predicates mention that there are several perpendicular lines, including Perpendicular(Line(A,B),Line(A,E)), which implies that AE is perpendicular to AB, hence AE is vertical. Similarly, BF is perpendicular to BC, which would be horizontal. Wait, earlier we considered that BF is vertical? No, if BC is vertical, then BF is perpendicular to BC, which would be horizontal. So BF is along the x-axis? Wait, point B is at (15,0,0), and BC is vertical, so BF is horizontal. So BF would go in the positive x-direction? But that would take us beyond the prism. 

Wait, no. If BC is vertical (from B(15,0,0) to C(15,9,0)), then a line perpendicular to BC would be horizontal in the x-y plane. But since B is at (15,0,0), moving horizontally from B could be either in x or y direction. Wait, BC is vertical (along y-axis), so a perpendicular direction would be along the x-axis or z-axis. But since the prism's height is along z-axis, and AE is already along z-axis. So BF being perpendicular to BC would be along the x or z-axis. But if it's perpendicular to BC, which is vertical, then BF could be along the x-axis or z-axis. But since AE is already along z-axis, maybe BF is along the z-axis? But that would make BF vertical, same as AE. 

This confusion suggests that my coordinate assignment might need adjustment. Let me reassign coordinates properly. 

Let me define the prism with base ABCD, where AB is length 15, BC is length 9. Let me place point A at (0, 0, 0). Then AB vector is along x-axis: B(15, 0, 0). BC vector is along y-axis: C(15, 9, 0). D is (-0, 9, 0)? Wait, no. In a rectangle, AB and DC are opposite sides. So D should be at (0, 9, 0). Then AD is from A(0,0,0) to D(0,9,0), which is along y-axis. 

Now, the height of the prism is 8 cm, so the vertical axis is z. Points E, F, G, H are vertically above A, B, C, D respectively. So E is (0, 0, 8), F is (15, 0, 8), G is (15, 9, 8), H is (0, 9, 8). 

Now, the lines AE, BF, CG, DH are all vertical, each of length 8 cm, matching the height of the prism. 

Now, the problem says a pyramid is removed from the prism. The question is to find the volume of the composite solid. 

Given that the predicates include several triangles and midpoints, perhaps the pyramid is formed by connecting midpoints of edges. For example, if we take midpoints of AB, BC, CD, DA, and the corresponding points on the top face. But again, not sure. 

Wait, the IsSideOf(Line(E,X),Triangle(E,F,Y)) suggests that Line(E,X) is a side of triangle E,F,Y. If X is the midpoint of EF, then Line(E,X) is from E to X, which is halfway along EF. So if Y is another point, say, the midpoint of FG, then the triangle E,F,Y would have vertices at E, F, and Y. 

But how does this relate to the pyramid? Maybe the pyramid is formed by these midpoints and other points. 

Alternatively, the pyramid could be a tetrahedron with vertices at E, F, G, and H. But that would be a four-faced figure, which is a tetrahedron. But the volume of that would be (1/3)*base_area*height. Let's calculate that. Take E(0,0,8), F(15,0,8), G(15,9,8), H(0,9,8). This forms a tetrahedron? Wait, no, because those four points lie on the same plane (z=8), so they're coplanar, making the volume zero. So that's not possible. 

Another possibility: the pyramid is formed by connecting point E to the triangle FGH. Wait, but F, G, H are on the same plane, so again, the volume would be zero. 

Wait, maybe the pyramid is formed by connecting the apex at A to the base triangle EFG. Let's compute its volume. Base is triangle EFG. E(0,0,8), F(15,0,8), G(15,9,8). This is a right triangle with legs 15 cm (EF) and 9 cm (FG). Area is (15*9)/2 = 67.5 cm². The height of the pyramid is the distance from A(0,0,0) to this base. Since the base is on z=8, the height is 8 cm. So volume is (1/3)*67.5*8 = 180 cm³. Then the composite volume would be 1080 - 180 = 900 cm³. 

Alternatively, if the apex is at D(0,9,0), then the height would be the distance from D to the base EFG, which is still 8 cm, giving the same volume. 

But why would the apex be at A or D? The problem says a pyramid is removed from the prism, but it doesn't specify where. However, given the predicates involving midpoints and lines, maybe the pyramid is smaller. 

Wait, the predicate Equals(LengthOf(E,X),Div(LengthOf(E,F),2)) implies that X is the midpoint of EF. Similarly, Z is the midpoint of EH. If we consider the triangle E,F,Z, then Line(E,Z) is a median. But how does this relate to the pyramid? 

Maybe the pyramid is formed by connecting these midpoints. For instance, if we take the midpoint of EF (X), midpoint of EH (Z), and other midpoints, forming a smaller shape inside the prism. 

Alternatively, the pyramid could be a frustum, but the problem says a pyramid. 

At this point, I think the most plausible assumption is that the pyramid removed is a right pyramid with a square base, but since the base of the prism is rectangular, perhaps it's a rectangular pyramid. 

Wait, if the base of the pyramid is a rectangle on the top face of the prism, say, from E to F to G to H, and the apex is at the center of the prism. The center of the prism would be at (7.5, 4.5, 4). The height of the pyramid would then be the distance from this apex to the top face, which is 4 cm (since the top face is at z=8). The volume of the pyramid would be (1/3)*base_area*height = (1/3)*(15*9)*4 = (1/3)*135*4 = 180 cm³. Subtracting from the prism volume gives 1080 - 180 = 900 cm³. 

But how to verify this? The problem mentions that the height of the prism is 8 cm, and the length and width are 15 and 9 cm. If the pyramid's height is 4 cm, then it's half of the prism's height. This seems plausible, but how does this relate to the given predicates? 

Looking back, the predicates mention that LengthOf(A,E) = 8 cm, which is the height of the prism. Also, there are midpoints involved, like X being midpoint of EF, Z being midpoint of EH. If the apex of the pyramid is at the midpoint of the prism's height, i.e., at z=4, then the height of the pyramid would be 4 cm. 

But without explicit information about the apex location, this is speculative. However, given the prevalence of midpoints in the predicates, it's likely that the pyramid's height is half of the prism's height, leading to a volume calculation of 180 cm³. 

Thus, the volume of the composite solid would be 1080 - 180 = 900 cm³. 

Alternatively, if the pyramid has a base that is a triangle, say, with base area 67.5 cm² and height 8 cm, giving volume 180 cm³, same result. 

Either way, the volume difference is 900 cm³. 

Therefore, I'll proceed with this calculation.
