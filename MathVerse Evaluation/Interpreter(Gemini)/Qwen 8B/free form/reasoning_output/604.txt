<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two competitors, Oliver and Justin, whose progress in a cycling race is represented by two linear functions on a graph where the x-axis is Time and the y-axis is Distance. The question is asking how much faster Oliver is traveling compared to Justin. 

First, I need to recall that in such graphs, the slope of a line represents the rate of change, which in this case would be speed since distance over time gives speed. Therefore, the steeper the line, the higher the speed. So, the difference in their speeds would be the difference in the slopes of their respective lines.

Looking at the given predicates, there are several points and lines mentioned. Let me parse them again:

- Point(Oliver) and Point(Justin) are points.
- Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin) are lines.
- There are also some other lines mentioned like Line(0,0), Line(1,25), Line(5,175), Line(5,125). Wait, maybe those are equations of lines? Like Line(a,b) could represent a line in the form y = ax + b? Or perhaps they are parametric representations? Hmm, but the way it's written, maybe each Line(X,Y) refers to a specific line with certain parameters. But the key thing here is that these lines are associated with the points Oliver and Justin lying on them.

Wait, the predicates say:

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(Oliver)) – so Oliver's point lies on his own line. Similarly for Justin. Also, PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(0,0)), which suggests that Oliver's point is on the line labeled Line(0,0). Similarly, Justin's point is on Line(1,25), Line(5,175), and Line(5,125)? Wait, no, looking back:

Wait, the given predicates include:

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver),Line(0,0))

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Justin),Line(1,25))

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver),Line(5,175))

PointLiesOnLine(Point(Justin),Line(5,125))

So, Oliver's point lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Justin's point lies on Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). Wait, but each person has their own line, Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin), which are presumably the lines representing their progress. However, the other lines are additional lines where their points lie. Maybe these lines are different from their own lines? Wait, but the first part says Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin) are lines, and then other lines are specified as Line(0,0), Line(1,25), etc. 

But perhaps the key is that each competitor's position is on specific lines. Wait, but how does that relate to their movement? Since the graph is showing their progress over time, the lines should represent their paths. If they're moving along straight lines (since it's a linear function), then each of their lines would be their respective paths. But the problem states "the graph with 2 linear functions", so each competitor's progress is a linear function, i.e., a straight line on the graph. 

Therefore, Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin) are the two lines representing their motion. Now, the question is about their speeds, which are the slopes of these lines. To find how much faster Oliver is going than Justin, we need to calculate the slope of Oliver's line minus the slope of Justin's line. 

However, the problem gives us more information: specific lines where their points lie. For example, Oliver's point lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Similarly, Justin's point lies on Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). Wait, but how do these lines relate to the lines representing their motion? Are these lines the same as their own lines (Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin))? Or are these other lines?

Let me think. Each competitor has a point (their position at some time?), and that point lies on certain lines. But if the graph is showing their progress over time, then the lines representing their motion (Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin)) would be straight lines starting from the origin, since typically in such problems, time starts at zero. But wait, the x-axis is Time and the y-axis is Distance. So, if we consider the lines representing their motion, they would start at (0,0) if they started at time 0 with distance 0. But maybe not necessarily. Alternatively, the lines could be parametrized differently. 

Alternatively, the lines mentioned like Line(0,0), Line(1,25), etc., could be equations of lines in the form y = mx + c. For instance, Line(0,0) might be the line passing through (0,0), Line(1,25) might pass through (1,25), etc. Wait, but how can we know? The names Line(0,0) might refer to a line defined by two points, but without more info, it's unclear. However, considering that the problem mentions "linear functions" for the progress, which are straight lines, and that the x-axis is Time and y-axis is Distance, so each line would have the equation y = mt + d, where m is the speed (slope) and d is the initial distance. 

But the problem says that the x-axis is Time and y-axis is Distance. So, if we assume that at time t=0, the distance covered is d. So, for each competitor, their line would be y = m*t + d. However, if they start from rest at t=0, then d=0, making it y = m*t. But unless stated otherwise, we can't assume that. 

But the problem gives us specific lines where their points lie. For example, Oliver's point lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Wait, but a point lying on a line means that the coordinates of the point satisfy the equation of the line. Suppose Line(0,0) is the line y = 0*x + 0, which is just the x-axis. Then, if Oliver's point lies on this line, that would mean that his y-coordinate is 0. But that seems odd because if he's in a cycling race, he would have moved away from the origin. Unless he hasn't started yet? But the problem says "progress of two competitors in a cycling race," implying that they have been moving. 

Alternatively, maybe Line(0,0) refers to a line with a particular slope. For example, in some contexts, Line(a,b) might refer to a line with slope a and intercept b. But that's speculative. 

Wait, another possibility: perhaps Line(0,0) is the line connecting the points (0,0) and something else? No, the naming isn't standard. 

Alternatively, maybe Line(0,0) is the line defined by two points: (0,0) and another point, but without knowing the second point, we can't determine its equation. This is confusing. 

Wait, but the problem mentions "the graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress..." So, there are two linear functions (lines) representing Oliver and Justin. Their positions are points on these lines. Additionally, their points lie on other lines. For example, Oliver's point lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). So, Oliver's point is the intersection of Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Similarly for Justin's point being on Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). 

If that's the case, then we can find the coordinates of Oliver's and Justin's points by finding the intersection of those lines. Once we have their coordinates, we can determine the equations of their respective lines (Oliver's and Justin's) and compute their slopes (speeds).

But how do we find the equations of Line(0,0), Line(1,25), Line(5,175), and Line(5,125)?

Assuming that Line(a,b) refers to a line with equation y = a*x + b. That's a common way to denote lines, though usually the notation might be different. Let's tentatively assume that Line(m, c) is the line y = m*x + c. Then:

- Line(0,0): y = 0*x + 0 → y = 0. This is the x-axis.
- Line(1,25): y = 1*x + 25 → y = x + 25
- Line(5,175): y = 5*x + 175
- Line(5,125): y = 5*x + 125

Now, Oliver's point lies on both Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). The intersection of these two lines is found by solving:

y = 0 (from Line(0,0)) and y = 5x + 175 (from Line(5,175)). Setting them equal:

0 = 5x + 175 → 5x = -175 → x = -35. So, the point is (-35, 0). 

Similarly, Justin's point lies on Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). Solving these equations:

y = x + 25 (from Line(1,25)) and y = 5x + 125 (from Line(5,125)). Set equal:

x + 25 = 5x + 125 → 25 - 125 = 5x - x → -100 = 4x → x = -25. Then y = (-25) + 25 = 0. So, the point is (-25, 0).

Wait, but both points are on the x-axis (since their y-coordinates are 0). But how does this relate to their motion? If the graph is showing their progress over time, then the x-axis is Time and the y-axis is Distance. So, if their points are on the x-axis, that would imply that at some time, their distance was zero. Which might be their starting point. But if they started at t=-35 and t=-25 respectively, that doesn't make sense because time shouldn't be negative in a race. Unless the graph includes negative times, which might represent before the race started. 

But assuming that the lines representing their motion (Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin)) are the ones that are the actual progress lines. Wait, earlier we had PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(Oliver)) and similarly for Justin. So, Oliver's point (which is (-35, 0)) lies on his own line, Line(Oliver). Similarly, Justin's point (-25, 0) lies on his own line, Line(Justin). 

But we don't know the equations of Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin). However, since the problem states that these are linear functions (so straight lines), and that the x-axis is Time and y-axis is Distance, we need to find the equations of these lines. 

But how? We only have one point for each line (the point where their point lies on the line). But a single point isn't enough to define a unique line. Unless there's another condition. 

Wait, but maybe Line(Oliver) is one of the lines mentioned earlier, like Line(0,0) or Line(5,175)? Because the problem says that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver). And we already determined that Oliver's point is (-35, 0), which lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). But maybe Line(Oliver) is one of those lines? For example, if Line(Oliver) is Line(5,175), then the line y = 5x + 175 passes through Oliver's point (-35, 0). Let's check:

At x = -35, y = 5*(-35) + 175 = -175 + 175 = 0. Correct. So, Line(Oliver) could be Line(5,175). Similarly, for Justin's line, his point (-25, 0) lies on Line(5,125):

At x = -25, y = 5*(-25) + 125 = -125 + 125 = 0. Correct. So, Line(Justin) could be Line(5,125). 

But why would that be the case? Because the problem says that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver), which is the line representing Oliver's progress. So, if Line(Oliver) is the line y = 5x + 175, then that would be his progress line. Similarly, Line(Justin) is y = 5x + 125. 

But then, the problem says that the graph shows two linear functions (the progress of the two competitors). So, if their progress lines are y = 5x + 175 and y = 5x + 125, then their speeds would be the slopes, which are both 5. But that would mean they have the same speed, which contradicts the question asking how much faster Oliver is. 

Hmm, there must be something wrong with my assumption here. 

Alternatively, maybe Line(Oliver) is not Line(5,175), but another line. Wait, but the only lines we have are Line(0,0), Line(1,25), Line(5,175), Line(5,125). Since Oliver's point lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175), and Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver). So, Line(Oliver) must be one of those lines. But if Line(Oliver) is Line(5,175), then as we saw, the slope is 5. But if the question asks how much faster Oliver is, then maybe Justin's line has a different slope. Wait, Justin's line is Line(5,125), which also has slope 5. So that can't be. 

This suggests that my interpretation of the Line(a,b) notation is incorrect. Perhaps Line(a,b) refers to a line that goes through the points (a,b) and something else? But without more info, that's hard to tell. 

Alternative approach: Let's think about the fact that the problem involves two linear functions (lines) representing the progress of Oliver and Justin. These lines have equations y = m1*t + d1 and y = m2*t + d2, where m is the speed and d is the initial distance. 

Since the problem mentions that the x-axis is Time (t) and y-axis is Distance (d), then the lines would be:

For Oliver: d = m_O * t + d_O

For Justin: d = m_J * t + d_J

We need to find m_O - m_J to see how much faster Oliver is.

To find these slopes, we need to find the equations of these lines. How can we get that information from the given predicates?

Given that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver), which is Oliver's line. Similarly for Justin. But we also have that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). So, the coordinates of Point(Oliver) must satisfy both Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). As previously calculated, that gives the point (-35, 0). Similarly, Point(Justin) lies on Line(1,25) and Line(5,125), giving the point (-25, 0). 

But how does this relate to their respective lines? If Point(Oliver) is on Line(Oliver), then the line Line(Oliver) passes through (-35, 0). Similarly, Line(Justin) passes through (-25, 0). But we still need another point to define the line. 

Wait, but maybe the Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin) are the same as the lines mentioned earlier, like Line(5,175) and Line(5,125)? If that's the case, then their equations are y = 5x + 175 and y = 5x + 125, which both have slope 5. But then their speeds would be the same, which contradicts the question. Hence, this can't be correct.

Another thought: Perhaps the lines Line(0,0), Line(1,25), etc., are not the same as the lines representing their motion. Instead, the lines Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin) are the ones that represent their motion, and the other lines are just additional constraints. 

But how can we determine the equations of Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin)? We know that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver), and we know the coordinates of Point(Oliver) are (-35, 0). But without another point, we can't uniquely determine the line. 

Wait, but maybe the other lines mentioned (like Line(0,0), Line(1,25), etc.) are the lines representing their motion. For example, Oliver's line is Line(0,0), and Justin's line is Line(1,25)? But that doesn't fit with the previous calculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines Line(0,0) and Line(5,175) are the same as the lines for Oliver's motion. But that brings us back to the earlier contradiction. 

Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the Line(a,b) notation. What if Line(a,b) represents a line with slope a and intercept b, as in y = ax + b? Then:

- Line(0,0) is y = 0x + 0 → y = 0
- Line(1,25) is y = 1x + 25
- Line(5,175) is y = 5x + 175
- Line(5,125) is y = 5x + 125

As before. 

Then, Oliver's point lies on both Line(0,0) and Line(5,175), which intersect at (-35, 0). Similarly, Justin's point lies on Line(1,25) and Line(5,125), intersecting at (-25, 0). 

Now, if these points (-35, 0) and (-25, 0) are the points where the competitors are at some time, but how does that relate to their motion lines? 

Maybe each competitor's motion line passes through their point and another point. For example, Oliver's line (Line(Oliver)) passes through (-35, 0) and another point. But we don't have that information. 

Wait, but the problem says that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(Oliver), and Line(Oliver) is a linear function representing Oliver's progress. So, if we can figure out the equation of Line(Oliver), we can get its slope. 

But how? Without more information about the line, it's impossible. Unless the line is one of the other lines mentioned, like Line(5,175), which we've seen passes through (-35, 0). So, if Line(Oliver) is Line(5,175), then its slope is 5. Similarly, Line(Justin) is Line(5,125), which also has slope 5. But then they have the same speed, which is not possible. 

This suggests that there's a different interpretation. Maybe the Line(0,0) and others are not the lines of motion but rather other lines in the graph. Perhaps the problem is that the graph contains multiple lines, and Oliver and Justin are on specific ones. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines Line(0,0), Line(1,25), etc., are the lines representing their motion. For example, Oliver is on Line(0,0), which is y=0, implying he's stationary. But that can't be. 

Wait, but the problem says it's a cycling race, so they are moving. So, their motion lines should have positive slopes. 

Another idea: Perhaps the numbers in Line(a,b) are not slope and intercept but instead coordinates of points. Like Line(a,b) is the line passing through (a,b) and another point? But without knowing the second point, we can't determine the line. 

Alternatively, maybe Line(a,b) is defined by two points, like Line(a,b) connects (a,0) and (0,b)? That would make the equation of the line as x/a + y/b = 1, or rearranged as y = (-b/a)x + b. 

In that case, for example, Line(0,0) would be undefined (as it's the origin), but Line(1,25) would connect (1,0) and (0,25), resulting in the equation y = -25x + 25. Similarly, Line(5,175) would connect (5,0) and (0,175), giving y = -35x + 175. 

Wait, let's test this. If Line(0,0) connects (0,0) and (0,0), which is just a single point, so that doesn't make sense. But maybe Line(a,b) refers to the line through (a,0) and (0,b)? That would make sense. For example, Line(1,25) would go through (1,0) and (0,25). Let's try this. 

So, assuming Line(a,b) is the line joining (a,0) and (0,b), then the equation is x/a + y/b = 1, or y = (-b/a)x + b. 

With this interpretation:

- Line(0,0) would be undefined since dividing by zero, but maybe it's the x-axis itself (y=0).
- Line(1,25): joins (1,0) and (0,25), equation y = -25x + 25.
- Line(5,175): joins (5,0) and (0,175), equation y = -35x + 175.
- Line(5,125): joins (5,0) and (0,125), equation y = -25x + 125.

Now, let's re-examine the points:

Oliver's point lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Assuming Line(0,0) is y=0, and Line(5,175) is y = -35x + 175. Finding their intersection: set y=0 in the second equation: 0 = -35x + 175 => x = 5. So the intersection point is (5, 0). 

Similarly, Justin's point lies on Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). Line(1,25): y = -25x + 25. Line(5,125): y = -25x + 125. These are parallel lines with the same slope (-25), so they never intersect. Wait, that can't be. So this suggests inconsistency. 

But the problem states that Point(Justin) lies on both Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). If these lines are parallel, they wouldn't intersect, which would mean no solution. Contradiction. Hence, this interpretation is also invalid. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different way. Let's try to think about what the question is asking: how much faster is Oliver traveling? That implies that we need to find the difference in their speeds, which are the slopes of their respective lines. 

Assuming that the lines representing their motion (Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin)) are the ones we need to find the slopes of. To do this, we need to find two points on each line. 

From the predicates, we know that Oliver's point lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Let's suppose that these lines are not the same as the motion lines, but rather other lines in the graph. So, the motion line for Oliver passes through his point, which is at the intersection of Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Similarly for Justin. 

But without knowing the equations of these lines, we can't determine the motion lines. 

Wait, maybe the lines Line(0,0), Line(1,25), Line(5,175), and Line(5,125) are the motion lines themselves. Let's check:

If Line(0,0) is Oliver's motion line, then it's y = 0, meaning he's not moving, which contradicts the cycling race. Similarly, Line(1,25) is y = x + 25, which has a slope of 1, so speed 1. Line(5,175) is y = 5x + 175, slope 5. Line(5,125) is y = 5x + 125, slope 5. 

If Oliver is on Line(5,175) and Justin on Line(5,125), both with slope 5, then they have the same speed. But the question asks how much faster Oliver is, so this can't be. 

Alternatively, if Oliver's motion line is Line(0,0) and Justin's is Line(1,25), then Oliver's speed is 0, and Justin's is 1. But that would mean Oliver is not moving, which might not make sense in a race. 

This suggests that my current interpretations are missing something. Let's try to look back at the original predicates and see if I missed anything.

Original Predicates:

- Point(Oliver)
- Point(Justin)
- Line(Oliver)
- Line(Justin)
- LengthOf(Time)
- LengthOf(Distance)
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(Oliver))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Justin), Line(Justin))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(0,0))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Justin), Line(1,25))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Oliver), Line(5,175))
- PointLiesOnLine(Point(Justin), Line(5,125))

Ah! Wait, there are two lines for each person: Line(Oliver) and Line(Justin), and additional lines named Line(0,0), Line(1,25), Line(5,175), Line(5,125). 

So, for example, Oliver's point lies on Line(Oliver) and also on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Similarly, Justin's point lies on Line(Justin), Line(1,25), and Line(5,125). 

This suggests that each competitor's point is the intersection of three lines: their own line (Line(Oliver) or Line(Justin)) and two other lines. 

Wait, but a single point can't lie on three lines unless those lines intersect at that point. So, for Oliver's point, it lies on Line(Oliver), Line(0,0), and Line(5,175). Similarly for Justin's point. 

This implies that Line(Oliver) is the line that intersects Line(0,0) and Line(5,175) at Oliver's point. Same for Line(Justin). 

Thus, Line(Oliver) is the line passing through the intersection of Line(0,0) and Line(5,175), and similarly Line(Justin) is the line passing through the intersection of Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). 

But wait, if Line(Oliver) is the line passing through the intersection of Line(0,0) and Line(5,175), then Line(Oliver) is the line that goes through that intersection point and possibly extends infinitely. But to find its equation, we need to know more about it. 

But we don't have additional information about Line(Oliver) or Line(Justin) except that they pass through those intersection points. However, without more points, we cannot determine the exact equation of the line. 

Wait, but perhaps Line(Oliver) is one of the lines mentioned, like Line(5,175)? If so, then Line(Oliver) is Line(5,175), and its slope is 5. Similarly, Line(Justin) is Line(5,125), slope 5. Again, leading to same speed. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe Line(Oliver) is the line that passes through the intersection point of Line(0,0) and Line(5,175), and also another point? But we don't have that information.

Wait, but the problem says "the graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors". So, there are two lines on the graph: one for Oliver and one for Justin. Each of these lines must pass through the points mentioned. 

For Oliver's line, it must pass through his point, which is the intersection of Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). Let's call this intersection point O. Similarly, Justin's line passes through his point J, which is the intersection of Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). 

If we can find the coordinates of O and J, then we can determine the equations of the lines representing their progress. 

Earlier calculations showed:

For Oliver's point O: Intersection of Line(0,0) (y=0) and Line(5,175) (y=5x + 175). Solving: 0 = 5x + 175 → x = -35. So, O is (-35, 0).

For Justin's point J: Intersection of Line(1,25) (y = x + 25) and Line(5,125) (y = 5x + 125). Setting equal: x + 25 = 5x + 125 → -4x = 100 → x = -25. Then y = -25 + 25 = 0. So, J is (-25, 0).

Now, we have two points on each of the lines representing Oliver and Justin's motion. Wait, but each line needs two points to define it. We only have one point per line. 

Unless the lines pass through the origin? If Oliver's line passes through (-35, 0) and the origin (0,0), then we can calculate the slope. Similarly for Justin's line. 

But why would the lines pass through the origin? Because in a cycling race, it's common to start from rest at t=0, but if the graph includes negative time, it might show the progress before the race started. 

Assuming that, for Oliver's line, it passes through (-35, 0) and (0, 0). Then, the slope would be (0 - 0)/(0 - (-35)) = 0/35 = 0. So, slope 0, meaning no speed. Which doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, if Oliver's line passes through (-35, 0) and another point. But we don't have that. 

Wait, but if we assume that the lines representing their progress are the lines that pass through their respective points and the origin? For example, Oliver's line passes through (-35, 0) and (0, 0), which would give a horizontal line (slope 0). But again, this suggests no speed. 

Alternatively, maybe the lines pass through their points and another point determined by the other lines. For example, Oliver's line passes through (-35, 0) and the intersection with another line? But we don't have that information. 

This seems stuck. Maybe I need to reconsider the entire approach. 

Let's try to focus on the fact that the question asks for the difference in speeds, which are the slopes of the two lines. To find the slopes, we need two points on each line. 

But from the given data, we have two points for each line: for Oliver, the intersection point with Line(0,0) and Line(5,175), which is (-35, 0). For Justin, the intersection point with Line(1,25) and Line(5,125), which is (-25, 0). 

But with only one point per line, we can't determine the slope. Unless there's an implicit assumption that the lines pass through the origin. 

If we assume that the lines representing their motion pass through the origin, then for Oliver's line, it passes through (-35, 0) and (0, 0). Slope is (0 - 0)/(0 - (-35)) = 0, as before. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, if the lines pass through the origin and their respective points, but that would mean for Oliver: (0,0) and (-35,0), which is horizontal line, slope 0. 

This suggests that the problem may require a different interpretation. Let's revisit the original predicates. 

Wait, the predicates mention LengthOf(Time) and LengthOf(Distance). Could this mean that the x-axis (Time) and y-axis (Distance) are measured in some units? For example, if the length of Time is T and the length of Distance is D, then the slopes would be D/T. 

But how does this help? 

Let me try to think differently. Since the x-axis is Time and y-axis is Distance, the slope of each line is Distance / Time = Speed. So, the slope is the speed. 

To find the slopes, we need two points on each line. 

For Oliver's line, we have one point: (-35, 0). But if we assume that at time t=0, the distance is 0, then the line passes through (0,0) and (-35, 0). But this would be a horizontal line, slope 0. 

But if the line passes through (-35, 0) and another point, say, when time is t, distance is d. But we don't have that. 

Wait, but maybe the lines Line(0,0) and Line(5,175) are not the same as the motion lines. Let's think: Line(0,0) is y=0, and Line(5,175) is y = 5x + 175. Their intersection is at (-35, 0). If this point is where Oliver is at some time, say, t = -35, distance 0. But if we want to find his speed, we need another point. 

Suppose that at t=0, Oliver is at some distance d. Then, his line would pass through (-35, 0) and (0, d). The slope would be (d - 0)/(0 - (-35)) = d/35. 

But without knowing d, we can't find the slope. 

Same for Justin: his line passes through (-25, 0) and (0, d_j), slope d_j/25. 

But how to find d? 

Wait, perhaps the other lines mentioned (Line(1,25) and Line(5,125)) are related to the distances at specific times. 

For example, Line(1,25) could mean that at time t=1, the distance is 25. Similarly, Line(5,125) means at time t=5, distance is 125. 

If that's the case, then for Justin, his line passes through (1, 25) and (5, 125). Let's calculate the slope: (125 - 25)/(5 - 1) = 100/4 = 25. So, Justin's speed is 25 units/time. 

Similarly, for Oliver, if his line passes through (5, 175) and (0, ?), but we don't have the second point. Wait, but we know that Oliver's point is at (-35, 0). If we assume that at time t=-35, distance is 0, and at t=5, distance is 175, then the slope would be (175 - 0)/(5 - (-35)) = 175/40 = 4.375. 

Wait, this is a new approach. Let's explore this. 

Assume that Line(a,b) represents a point (a, b) on the graph, meaning at time a, the distance is b. So, Line(1,25) means at time t=1, distance is 25. Line(5,125) means at time t=5, distance is 125. Similarly, Line(0,0) means at time 0, distance 0. Line(5,175) means at time 5, distance 175. 

If this is the case, then:

- For Justin, his line passes through (1, 25) and (5, 125). As calculated earlier, slope is 25. So, his speed is 25 units per time unit.

- For Oliver, his line passes through (5, 175) and (-35, 0). Calculating the slope: (175 - 0)/(5 - (-35)) = 175/40 = 4.375. 

So, Oliver's speed is 4.375, Justin's is 25. The difference is 25 - 4.375 = 20.625. 

But wait, the question asks how much faster is Oliver traveling. If Oliver's speed is less than Justin's, then the difference would be negative, but since it asks "how much faster," it would be the absolute value. But according to this, Oliver is slower, so this can't be correct. 

Wait, but this depends on the interpretation of Line(a,b). If Line(a,b) is a point (a,b) on the graph, then for Oliver, his line passes through (-35, 0) and (5, 175). So, slope is (175 - 0)/(5 - (-35)) = 175/40 = 4.375. 

But if Justin's line passes through (1,25) and (5,125), slope is (125 - 25)/4 = 25. So, Justin is faster. But the question asks how much faster is Oliver, which would be negative, but likely the question assumes Oliver is faster. 

This suggests that either the interpretation is wrong, or there's a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, perhaps Line(a,b) represents the line passing through (a,b) and the origin. So, Line(1,25) is the line through (1,25) and (0,0), which has slope 25/1 = 25. Similarly, Line(5,125) is the line through (5,125) and (0,0), slope 125/5 = 25. So, both lines have slope 25, which would mean Justin's speed is 25. 

For Line(0,0), it's the x-axis, slope 0. Line(5,175) is through (5,175) and (0,0), slope 175/5 = 35. So, Oliver's line is Line(5,175), slope 35. 

Thus, Oliver's speed is 35, Justin's is 25. Difference is 10. 

This fits with the question asking how much faster Oliver is. 

But how did we arrive at this interpretation? By assuming that Line(a,b) is the line passing through (a,b) and the origin. This would mean that each Line(a,b) is a line from the origin to the point (a,b). 

Let's verify:

- Line(0,0) is the x-axis, slope 0.
- Line(1,25) is from (0,0) to (1,25), slope 25.
- Line(5,175) is from (0,0) to (5,175), slope 35.
- Line(5,125) is from (0,0) to (5,125), slope 25.

Now, for Oliver, his point lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). The intersection of these lines is at (0,0) and (5,175). Wait, but Line(0,0) is the x-axis, and Line(5,175) is the line from (0,0) to (5,175). Their intersection is at (0,0) and (5,175)? No, they intersect at (0,0) and all points along Line(5,175) are on Line(0,0) only at (0,0). Wait, no. Line(0,0) is the x-axis, and Line(5,175) is a line from (0,0) to (5,175). So, their intersection is at (0,0) and all points on Line(5,175) are on Line(0,0) only at (0,0). So, the only common point is (0,0). But the predicate says Point(Oliver) lies on both Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). So, Point(Oliver) is (0,0). 

But then, if Oliver's point is (0,0), which is on Line(Oliver), which would be Line(5,175)? But (0,0) is on Line(5,175) only if it passes through (0,0). Yes, because Line(5,175) passes through (0,0) and (5,175). So, Oliver's point is (0,0), which is on Line(Oliver) (Line(5,175)). 

Similarly, Justin's point lies on Line(1,25) and Line(5,125). Line(1,25) is from (0,0) to (1,25), and Line(5,125) is from (0,0) to (5,125). Their intersection is at (0,0) and (5,125)? No, they intersect at (0,0) and along their common points. But these lines are different, so their only common point is (0,0). Hence, Point(Justin) is (0,0). But that would mean both Oliver and Justin are at (0,0), which conflicts with the problem statement. 

This suggests that this interpretation is also flawed. 

But wait, if we take Line(0,0) as the x-axis, and Line(5,175) as the line from (5,175) to (0,0), then their intersection is at (0,0). So, Oliver's point is (0,0). Similarly, for Justin, Line(1,25) and Line(5,125) intersect at (0,0). Hence, both points are at (0,0). This implies both competitors are at the same point, which doesn't make sense for a race. 

This indicates that there's still a misinterpretation. 

Perhaps the key is to realize that the lines Line(a,b) are not from the origin but are arbitrary lines. Given the complexity, perhaps the intended solution is to recognize that the slopes of the lines representing their motion are 5 and 25, leading to a difference of 20. 

But how? 

Let's try one last approach. Assume that the lines Line(0,0), Line(1,25), Line(5,175), and Line(5,125) are the lines representing their motion. 

For Oliver, his line is Line(5,175), which has slope 5. For Justin, his line is Line(5,125), slope 5. But this leads to same speed. 

Alternatively, if Line(1,25) is Justin's line, slope 1, and Line(5,175) is Oliver's, slope 5. Then, difference is 4. 

But how to determine which line belongs to whom? 

The predicates say that Point(Oliver) lies on Line(0,0) and Line(5,175). If Line(0,0) is the x-axis, and Line(5,175) is the line with slope 5, then Oliver's point is at (-35, 0). If this is his
