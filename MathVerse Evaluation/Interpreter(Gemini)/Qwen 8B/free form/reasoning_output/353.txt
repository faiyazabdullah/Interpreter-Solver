QUESTION:
An airplane is currently flying 35^\circ  south of east, as shown in the image.

The control tower orders the plane to change course by turning 7^\circ  to the left. How many degrees south of east is the new course that the plane is ordered to fly?

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about an airplane that's currently flying 35 degrees south of east. Then, it gets ordered to turn 7 degrees to the left. I need to find the new heading, how many degrees south of east it is now.

First, I should visualize the scenario. Let me recall that directions like "south of east" refer to angles measured clockwise from the east direction towards the south. Wait, actually, no—when they say "south of east," it's usually measured from the east axis towards the south. So if something is flying 35 degrees south of east, that means its direction is 35 degrees downward from the east axis. Imagine standing at the origin facing east; turning 35 degrees towards the south would point you southwest, but specifically 35 degrees from east towards south.

Now, the plane is turning 7 degrees to the left. But wait, left from where? If the plane is moving along a certain direction, turning left would mean changing its heading counterclockwise relative to its current path. However, since we're dealing with compass directions, I need to clarify the coordinate system here.

Let me think of standard position in mathematics where angles are measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (east). However, in navigation, bearings are often measured clockwise from north or east. But the problem mentions "south of east," so maybe it's better to model this with a coordinate system where east is the positive x-axis and north is the positive y-axis. 

Wait, if the plane is flying 35 degrees south of east, that would correspond to an angle measured clockwise from the east axis towards the south. In standard mathematical terms, that would be equivalent to 360 - 35 = 325 degrees if we consider standard position (counterclockwise from positive x-axis). But perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the bearing. Alternatively, maybe considering the angle as part of a coordinate system where the initial direction is along the positive x-axis (east), and the angle is measured towards the negative y-axis (south).

So, initially, the plane's direction is 35 degrees south of east. Let me draw a mental diagram: starting at the origin, pointing east (positive x-axis), then turning 35 degrees towards the south, which would place the direction vector in the fourth quadrant (if we consider standard Cartesian coordinates). Alternatively, in navigation terms, sometimes headings are measured clockwise from north, but here it's specified as south of east, so probably not that.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is measured from the east axis towards the south, so the direction is southeast, but more towards south than east. So, if you imagine the plane's path making a 35-degree angle with the east direction, going towards the south.

Now, when the plane turns 7 degrees to the left, what does that do to its direction? Turning left would mean rotating the direction counterclockwise from its current heading. Wait, but depending on the plane's orientation. If the plane is moving along a direction that's 35 degrees south of east, then turning left would mean turning towards the north? Or maybe towards the west? Hmm, need to clarify.

Wait, suppose the plane is moving along a direction that's 35 degrees south of east. That is, if you face east and then turn 35 degrees towards the south. So, if you are facing east and turn left (which would normally be towards north), but in this case, turning left from the current direction. Wait, no—if the plane is moving along a direction that's south of east, then turning left would depend on the direction of the turn. Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the plane's heading. Let me define the initial direction as a vector.

Let me represent the initial direction as an angle from the positive x-axis (east). Since it's 35 degrees south of east, that would be equivalent to an angle of -35 degrees in standard position (clockwise from the positive x-axis). Alternatively, in some contexts, it could be considered as 360 - 35 = 325 degrees. But maybe it's better to model it as a vector pointing in the direction of 35 degrees below the positive x-axis (east). So, in standard position, that's 360 - 35 = 325 degrees. 

If the plane turns 7 degrees to the left, then depending on the direction of the turn. Left from the pilot's perspective. If the plane is moving along a direction that's 35 degrees south of east, then turning left would mean turning towards the north. Because if you are facing southeast, turning left would bring you towards the northeast? Wait, no. Wait, if you are facing east, and turn left, you face north. But if you are facing south, turning left would make you face east. Wait, maybe I need to think of the plane's current direction as a vector and then rotate it.

Alternatively, think of the initial direction as 35 degrees south of east, so the angle between the east direction and the plane's path is 35 degrees towards the south. Now, turning left would mean increasing the angle towards the north. Wait, if you are going south of east, turning left would make you go more eastward? No. Suppose you're facing directly east. Turn left (north), but if you're already south of east, turning left would decrease the south component. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of angles.

Let me consider the initial direction as an angle θ measured clockwise from the north. But maybe that complicates things. Alternatively, using standard position angles (counterclockwise from positive x-axis). Let me formalize:

Let’s assume the positive x-axis is east, and positive y-axis is north. A direction that is 35 degrees south of east would lie in the fourth quadrant. The angle from the positive x-axis to this direction is -35 degrees, or equivalently 360 - 35 = 325 degrees. 

When the plane turns 7 degrees to the left, we need to adjust this angle. Turning left from the current direction would mean rotating the direction counterclockwise. Because in aviation, when you turn left, you rotate the aircraft to the left, which corresponds to increasing the angle in the counterclockwise direction. 

Therefore, if the initial direction is 325 degrees (or -35 degrees), turning left by 7 degrees would add 7 degrees to the angle. So, the new angle would be 325 + 7 = 332 degrees. 

But wait, 332 degrees is equivalent to -28 degrees in standard position. Which would be 28 degrees south of west? Wait, no. Let me check:

If the angle is 332 degrees from the positive x-axis (east), that is 360 - 332 = 28 degrees in the fourth quadrant. Wait, no. Wait, 332 degrees is 360 - 332 = 28 degrees less than a full rotation. So, it's 28 degrees clockwise from the positive x-axis? No, because standard position angles are counterclockwise. So 332 degrees counterclockwise from positive x-axis is equivalent to rotating 332 degrees CCW, which is the same as rotating -28 degrees (since 332 = 360 - 28). Therefore, the direction is 28 degrees below the positive x-axis, i.e., 28 degrees south of east. Wait, but that contradicts the previous thought. Wait, no—if the angle is 332 degrees, then starting from the positive x-axis, rotating counterclockwise 332 degrees would land us in the fourth quadrant, 28 degrees below the positive x-axis (since 360 - 332 = 28). Therefore, the direction is 28 degrees south of east. 

But that seems conflicting with the idea that turning left from 35 degrees south of east (which was 325 degrees) by 7 degrees would lead to 332 degrees, which is 28 degrees south of east. Therefore, the new course is 28 degrees south of east. 

Wait, but the original direction was 35 degrees south of east. Turning left by 7 degrees would reduce the angle south of east? Because turning left from a direction that is south of east would make it more eastward. For example, if you are heading directly east (0 degrees), turning left would take you north. If you are heading 35 degrees south of east, turning left would make you head more east, reducing the south component. Hence, the angle south of east decreases. So, subtracting 7 degrees from 35 gives 28 degrees. So the answer is 28 degrees. 

But let me confirm with another method. Suppose the initial angle is 35 degrees south of east. This can be represented as a vector making 35 degrees below the positive x-axis. The direction is such that the angle between the direction of flight and the east axis is 35 degrees towards south. 

When the plane turns left, it changes its direction. If the turn is to the left, then the angle relative to the east axis becomes smaller. So, if originally it was 35 degrees south of east, after turning left by 7 degrees, the new angle would be 35 - 7 = 28 degrees south of east. 

This seems straightforward, but I need to ensure there's no confusion with the direction of the turn. Another way: imagine the plane is on a heading of 35° S of E. If it turns left, it's heading towards the north. So, the angle between its new direction and east would decrease. For instance, if you were going straight east (0°), turning left 7° would take you to 7° N of E. Similarly, if you were going 35° S of E, turning left by 7° would make it 35° - 7° = 28° S of E. 

Yes, that makes sense. So the new course is 28 degrees south of east. 

Wait, but why isn't it adding? Because turning left from a southeasterly direction would decrease the south component. For example, if you are heading SE (southeast), which is 45° S of E. Turning left (towards north) would make it more towards east. So, if you have a heading of 35° S of E, turning left reduces the south component. So, subtracting 7 degrees from 35 gives 28 degrees. 

Hence, the answer should be 28 degrees. 

Let me check again using angle addition. The initial angle from the east axis is 35° towards south. Turning left by 7°, which in terms of the angle from the east axis, would subtract 7°, resulting in 35° - 7° = 28°. 

Therefore, the new course is 28 degrees south of east. 

I think that's correct. So the answer is 28 degrees.
