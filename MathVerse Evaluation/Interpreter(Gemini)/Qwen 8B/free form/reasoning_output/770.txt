Okay, let's try to tackle this geometry problem. First, I need to understand what's given and what's being asked. 

So, the problem mentions a large circle with center P, and there are seven small circles that are congruent. All these small circles have equal radii, and they share only the points marked on the circles. Points A and B are on the large circle since PA and PB are radii. Also, sectors PA and PB are shaded. The question is asking for the area of the shaded portion compared to the area of one of the small circles. Specifically, how many times larger is the shaded area than one small circle?

Let me start by parsing the given predicates. There are several key points here:

1. Point(A), Point(B), Point(P): These are three distinct points. P is the center of the large circle. PA and PB are radii, so their lengths are equal because they're both radii of the same circle. So, LengthOf(Line(P,A)) equals LengthOf(Line(P,B)). 

2. Circle(P) refers to the large circle centered at P. Circles 1 through 7 are the smaller ones. It says all seven small circles are congruent, so each has the same radius. Also, it's mentioned that the large circle and the small ones share only the points marked. That probably means that each small circle touches the large circle at exactly one point, but maybe not overlapping otherwise? Or perhaps each small circle is tangent to the large circle?

Wait, another detail: PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(P)) and similarly for B. So points A and B lie on the large circle. Also, IsRadiusOf(Line(P,A), Circle(P)) and same for Line(P,B). So PA and PB are radii of the large circle. Therefore, the length of PA is equal to the radius of the large circle. Let me denote the radius of the large circle as R. Then, the radius of each small circle is r, since they are congruent.

Now, the shaded portions are Sector(P,A,$) and Sector(P,B,$). Wait, the notation might mean two sectors: one with center P, starting at A and going to some other point, and another with center P starting at B. But the problem mentions "the shaded portion" – maybe two sectors? Or maybe one sector? Wait, the original problem says "the shaded portion", but the given predicates mention Shaded(Sector(P,A,$)) and Shaded(Sector(P,B,$)). Maybe there are two shaded sectors, each corresponding to points A and B?

But the problem says the shaded portion is how many times the area of one small circle. So maybe the total shaded area is the sum of the two sectors?

Alternatively, maybe the shaded regions are segments or something else. Wait, the problem states that the seven small circles share only those points on the circles that are marked. So, perhaps each small circle is tangent to the large circle and maybe tangent to others? But without seeing the diagram, we need to infer.

But the key thing is that the shaded sectors are part of the large circle. Since PA and PB are radii, sectors would be like slices of the large circle. If A and B are points on the circumference, then the sectors could be the regions bounded by two radii (PA and PB) and the arc AB. However, the problem mentions two shaded sectors: one with P, A, and some other point (maybe B?), and another with P, B, and another point? Wait, the notation Shaded(Sector(P,A,$)) might indicate that the sector starts at P, goes through A, and ends at some other point. But since there are two such shaded sectors (for A and B), maybe each sector corresponds to a certain angle?

Alternatively, maybe the shaded regions are the two sectors formed by PA and PB? If points A and B are endpoints of two radii, then the sector between them would be the region between PA, PB, and the arc AB. But if there are two shaded sectors, maybe each sector is half of the circle? Not sure yet.

But let's think about the area of the shaded portion. If the shaded regions are two sectors of the large circle, then we need to find the measure of the angles of those sectors and compute their areas. Alternatively, maybe the shaded regions are parts of the small circles? But no, the problem says the shaded portion is part of the large circle's sectors.

Wait, the problem says "the area of the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles". So the shaded area is made up of parts of the large circle, possibly minus some areas, or just the sectors themselves.

Another thought: since there are seven small circles, all congruent, and they share only the points on the circles that are marked. So maybe each small circle is tangent to the large circle and also tangent to adjacent small circles? This would form a configuration where the centers of the small circles are arranged around the large circle's circumference.

If that's the case, then the arrangement of the small circles would imply that their centers are located on the circumference of the large circle, each touching its neighbors and the large circle. But how does that relate to points A and B?

Wait, the problem mentions that PA and PB are radii of the large circle, and points A and B lie on the large circle. If the small circles are arranged symmetrically around the large circle, then points A and B could be centers of two of the small circles? Or maybe points where the small circles touch the large circle?

Alternatively, since each small circle has the same radius, and they are all congruent, if each small circle is tangent to the large circle, then the distance from P (center of large circle) to the center of each small circle would be R - r, where R is the radius of the large circle, and r is the radius of the small circles. Because if two circles are tangent externally, the distance between centers is the sum of radii. But if the small circles are inside the large circle and tangent to it, then the distance between centers would be R - r.

But if there are seven small circles arranged around the large circle, each tangent to the large circle and to their neighboring small circles, then we can model their centers lying on a circle concentric with the large circle. The centers of the small circles would form a regular heptagon (7-sided polygon) around the center P. Each side of the heptagon would correspond to the distance between centers of adjacent small circles, which is 2r (since each small circle has radius r and they are tangent).

The radius of the circle on which the centers of the small circles lie would then be R - r, as mentioned earlier. The distance between adjacent centers of small circles is 2r. In a regular heptagon, the length of each side s is related to the radius of the circumscribed circle (which here is R - r). The formula for the side length s of a regular n-gon is s = 2(R - r) * sin(π/n). Here, n=7, so s = 2(R - r) * sin(π/7).

But we know that s = 2r. Therefore:

2r = 2(R - r) * sin(π/7)

Divide both sides by 2:

r = (R - r) * sin(π/7)

Then, rearranging:

r / (R - r) = sin(π/7)

Which gives:

r = R * sin(π/7) / (1 + sin(π/7))

But this seems complicated. However, maybe we don't need to calculate the exact ratio unless it's required. However, the problem doesn't give numerical values, so perhaps there's another way.

But wait, maybe the shaded sectors are related to the angles subtended by points A and B. If points A and B are centers of two of the small circles, then the angle between PA and PB would be the central angle between two adjacent small circles. In a regular heptagon, the central angle between adjacent vertices is 2π/7 radians. So, the sector defined by PA and PB would have an angle of 2π/7 radians.

Therefore, the area of the sector would be (θ/2π) * πR² = (θ/2) * R². So, substituting θ = 2π/7, the area would be (πR²)/7.

But the problem mentions two shaded sectors? Or maybe one? Wait, the initial description says "Sector(P,A,$)" and "Sector(P,B,$)". Maybe each shaded sector is a segment of the large circle? But without more info, it's hard to tell. However, the problem says "the shaded portion", implying a single area. But the given predicates include two shaded sectors. Maybe each sector is 1/7th of the circle, making the total shaded area 2/7th of the circle?

But then the question is comparing that to the area of one small circle. So if the shaded area is 2*(area of sector), and the area of a small circle is πr², then the ratio would be [2*(sector area)] / (πr²).

But we need to find that ratio. To do this, first, we need to express sector area in terms of R and r, then relate R and r via the fact that the small circles are arranged around the large circle.

Earlier, we had the equation from the regular heptagon setup:

From the side length relation:

s = 2r = 2(R - r) sin(π/7)

So,

r = (R - r) sin(π/7)

=> r = R sin(π/7) - r sin(π/7)

Bring terms with r to left:

r + r sin(π/7) = R sin(π/7)

Factor out r:

r (1 + sin(π/7)) = R sin(π/7)

Thus,

R = r (1 + sin(π/7)) / sin(π/7) = r [1/sin(π/7) + 1]

So, R = r [csc(π/7) + 1]

But this seems messy. However, if we consider the area of the sector. Suppose that the shaded area is two sectors each with angle 2π/7. Wait, but if points A and B are separated by one small circle, then the angle between PA and PB would be 2π/7. But if there are two such sectors, then total angle would be 2*(2π/7) = 4π/7. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, if points A and B are adjacent, then the angle between them is 2π/7. So the sector area would be (2π/7)/2π * πR² = (1/7) * πR². Thus, one sector is 1/7th of the large circle. If there are two such sectors, then total shaded area would be 2/7th of the large circle.

Then, the area of the shaded portion is 2/7 * πR². Now, compare this to the area of one small circle, which is πr². So the ratio would be (2/7 πR²) / (πr²) ) = (2R²)/(7r²).

We need to find this ratio. From earlier, we found R = r [1 + sin(π/7)] / sin(π/7). Let's substitute that in:

R = r [1/sin(π/7) + 1] => R = r [ (1 + sin(π/7)) / sin(π/7) ]

Thus, R² = r² [ (1 + sin(π/7))² / sin²(π/7) ]

Plugging back into the ratio:

(2R²)/(7r²) = 2/(7) * [ (1 + sin(π/7))² / sin²(π/7) ]

This seems complicated. However, maybe there's a simpler relationship. Wait, maybe the shaded area isn't two sectors but something else.

Wait, the problem mentions that the seven small circles are congruent and share only the points on the circles that are marked. So maybe each small circle is tangent to the large circle and to two other small circles. Hence, forming a symmetrical arrangement. In that case, the centers of the small circles lie on a circle of radius R - r, and the distance between centers of adjacent small circles is 2r. As before.

But maybe instead of dealing with trigonometry, there's a different approach. For example, if the shaded area is two sectors of the large circle, each with angle θ, then the total area would be 2*(θ/2)*R² = θR². But how much is θ?

Alternatively, if the shaded sectors correspond to the angles between points A and B. If A and B are centers of two small circles, then the angle between PA and PB would be the central angle between two adjacent small circles, which is 2π/7. So each sector is 2π/7. If there are two such sectors, then total angle is 4π/7, leading to area (4π/7)/2π * πR² = 2R²/7. Then the ratio would be (2R²/7)/(πr²). But again, need to relate R and r.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is just one sector. Wait, the problem says "the shaded portion" and the given predicates have two shaded sectors. Maybe the shaded region is the union of two sectors? Or maybe each shaded sector is a different shape?

Wait, perhaps the shaded regions are actually lens-shaped areas formed by the intersection of the large circle and the small circles? But the problem states that the small circles share only the points on the circles that are marked. So, maybe the shaded regions are parts of the large circle outside the small circles? But that's unclear.

Wait, the problem statement says: "the seven small circles, which have equal radii, and the large circle share only those points on the circles that are marked." So, the only common points between the large circle and the small circles are the points that are marked. Which might be the points where the small circles touch the large circle. So, each small circle touches the large circle at one point. Hence, each small circle is tangent to the large circle. 

If that's the case, then the center of each small circle lies along the line connecting P to the point of tangency. So, for example, if a small circle is tangent to the large circle at point A, then the center of that small circle lies along PA, at a distance of R - r from P. Similarly for point B. So, if points A and B are points of tangency for two of the small circles, then their centers are along PA and PB respectively, at distance R - r from P.

But then, if there are seven small circles, each tangent to the large circle, their centers are located along seven different radii of the large circle. So, the centers of the small circles divide the large circle into seven equal arcs? Or maybe not necessarily equal, unless they are placed symmetrically.

However, the problem mentions that the seven small circles are congruent and share only those points on the circles that are marked. So, if each small circle is tangent to the large circle and to its neighbor, then the centers of the small circles would form a regular heptagon around P, as previously discussed. 

Assuming that, then the central angle between two adjacent centers of small circles is 2π/7. The distance between centers of adjacent small circles is 2r, as they are tangent. The distance between centers of two adjacent small circles can also be expressed in terms of the radius of the circle on which their centers lie. If the centers are located on a circle of radius d = R - r, then the chord length between two adjacent centers is 2d sin(π/7). Setting this equal to 2r:

2d sin(π/7) = 2r → d sin(π/7) = r

Since d = R - r, we get:

(R - r) sin(π/7) = r → R sin(π/7) - r sin(π/7) = r → R sin(π/7) = r(1 + sin(π/7)) → R = r (1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7)

So, R = r [1/sin(π/7) + 1]. 

Now, returning to the shaded area. Assuming that the shaded sectors are the two sectors corresponding to points A and B. If A and B are the points of tangency of two small circles, then the angle between PA and PB is the angle between two adjacent radii of the large circle, which would be 2π/7. Hence, the area of the sector corresponding to PA and PB would be (angle/2π) * πR² = (angle/2) * R². So, for one sector, it's (2π/7)/2 * R² = πR²/7. If there are two such sectors, then total shaded area would be 2πR²/7.

But the question asks for how many times the area of the shaded portion is compared to one small circle. The area of one small circle is πr². So the ratio would be (2πR²/7) / (πr²) = 2R²/(7r²).

Substituting R from earlier:

R = r [1 + sin(π/7)] / sin(π/7)

Square both sides:

R² = r² [ (1 + sin(π/7))² ] / sin²(π/7)

Plug into the ratio:

2R²/(7r²) = 2 * [ (1 + sin(π/7))² / sin²(π/7) ] / 7

This simplifies to:

[2(1 + sin(π/7))² ] / [7 sin²(π/7)]

Hmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps there's a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, maybe the shaded area isn't two sectors but something else. Let me re-examine the problem statement. 

The problem says: "the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles?" And the shaded regions are described as Sector(P,A,$) and Sector(P,B,$). The notation might suggest that each shaded sector is a sector of the large circle, with vertex at P, one side being PA, and the other side being... something else. Maybe the other side is the tangent point of the small circle?

Wait, if the shaded sector is bounded by PA and the arc from A to the point where the small circle touches the large circle. Wait, but if the small circle is tangent at A, then the radius of the small circle would be along PA, but the center of the small circle is at a distance R - r from P. So, the center of the small circle is along PA, at distance R - r from P. The point A is on the large circle, so PA = R. The small circle's center is at distance R - r from P, so the distance from the center of the small circle to A is R - (R - r) = r, which matches the radius of the small circle. So, the small circle touches the large circle at A, and its center is along PA.

But then, if the shaded sector is the sector of the large circle between PA and another radius, say, PB. But how does that relate to the small circles?

Alternatively, maybe the shaded sectors are the regions between the large circle and the small circles? Like, the area of the sector minus the area of the small circle? But the problem says "the shaded portion," which might refer to the sectors themselves.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded regions are the two small sectors created by the radii PA and PB, and the arc AB. If A and B are points where the small circles touch the large circle, then the angle between PA and PB depends on how many small circles are between them.

Wait, if there are seven small circles arranged around the large circle, then the angle between two adjacent points of tangency (like A and B) would be 2π/7. So, if points A and B are adjacent, then the angle between them is 2π/7. Hence, the area of the sector between PA and PB would be (2π/7)/2π * πR² = πR²/7. So, if there are two such sectors, but I'm not sure why there would be two.

Wait, the problem mentions two shaded sectors: Sector(P,A,$) and Sector(P,B,$). Maybe each sector is the area between PA and the next radius, and similarly for PB. If there are two shaded sectors, each spanning an angle of 2π/7, then total shaded area would be 2*(πR²/7) = 2πR²/7.

But then, the ratio to the area of a small circle is (2πR²/7) / (πr²) = 2R²/(7r²). 

As earlier, we have R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7). Substituting:

R = r [1 + sin(π/7)] / sin(π/7)

So R/r = [1 + sin(π/7)] / sin(π/7) = 1/sin(π/7) + 1

Thus, R²/r² = [1/sin(π/7) + 1]^2

Therefore, the ratio becomes:

2 * [1/sin(π/7) + 1]^2 / 7

But calculating this numerically would require knowing the value of sin(π/7). π/7 is approximately 25.714 degrees. Let me calculate sin(π/7):

π ≈ 3.1416, so π/7 ≈ 0.4488 radians.

sin(π/7) ≈ sin(0.4488) ≈ 0.4339.

So 1/sin(π/7) ≈ 2.3047

Adding 1: 2.3047 + 1 = 3.3047

Squaring that: ~10.92

Multiply by 2: ~21.84

Divide by 7: ~3.12

So the ratio would be approximately 3.12 times. But the problem likely expects an exact value or a simple fraction. However, since π/7 is involved, it's unlikely to simplify nicely. This suggests that my assumption might be incorrect.

Wait, maybe the shaded area is not two sectors but one sector. Let me reconsider.

If the shaded area is just one sector, say between PA and PB, which is 2π/7 radians, then its area is πR²/7. Compare this to πr². Ratio is R²/(7r²). Using R = r [1 + sin(π/7)] / sin(π/7), then R²/r² = [1 + sin(π/7)]² / sin²(π/7). Plugging numbers:

[1 + 0.4339]^2 / (0.4339)^2 ≈ (1.4339)^2 / 0.1882 ≈ 2.056 / 0/1882 ≈ 10.92. So the ratio would be ~10.92, which is roughly 11. But this still doesn't seem like a clean answer. 

But the problem states that there are seven small circles. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the entire area of the large circle compared to the small ones. If the seven small circles are arranged around the large circle, their total area would be 7πr². But the area of the large circle is πR². If the shaded area is a portion of the large circle, perhaps the shaded area relates to the number of small circles?

Wait, but the problem says the shaded portion is the area of the sectors, not the entire large circle. Another idea: if each small circle is tangent to the large circle and to two other small circles, then the area of the shaded sectors could relate to the angular coverage of the small circles. 

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is the area of the two sectors minus the areas of the small circles? But that's speculative.

Wait, the problem says that the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles. If the shaded area is two sectors of the large circle, each with angle θ, then the total shaded area is 2*(θ/2π)*πR² = θR². We need to find θ.

But how to find θ? If points A and B are the points of tangency of two small circles, then the angle between PA and PB would depend on the position of the small circles. If there are seven small circles, the angle between adjacent points of tangency is 2π/7. So if the shaded area is the sector between PA and PB, which are two adjacent points, then θ = 2π/7. Hence, shaded area is (2π/7)*R². Dividing by πr² gives (2π/7 R²)/(πr²) = 2R²/(7r²). 

Again, needing to relate R and r. Earlier, we had R = r [1 + sin(π/7)] / sin(π/7). Squaring gives R² = r² [ (1 + sin(π/7))^2 / sin²(π/7) ]. Substituting into the ratio:

2 * [ (1 + sin(π/7))^2 / sin²(π/7) ] / 7 

But this is the same as before. Let me compute this expression numerically:

First, calculate sin(π/7) ≈ 0.433884

So 1 + sin(π/7) ≈ 1.433884

Squared: ≈ 2.056

Denominator: sin²(π/7) ≈ 0.1882

So the fraction is 2.056 / 0.1882 ≈ 10.92

Multiply by 2: 21.84

Divide by 7: ≈ 3.12

So the shaded area is approximately 3.12 times the area of one small circle. But this is an approximate value. However, the problem may expect an exact expression, or perhaps there's a simpler relationship.

Wait, maybe my assumption about the angle being 2π/7 is wrong. What if the shaded sectors are not between adjacent small circles but something else? For example, if points A and B are diametrically opposite, then the angle would be π radians. But that would make the shaded area πR²/2, which would give a higher ratio. But with seven small circles, it's unlikely that A and B are diametrically opposite.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is the area between two radii PA and PB, where A and B are points where small circles are tangent. If there are seven small circles, the angle between PA and PB could be 2π/7, but if there are two shaded sectors, then total angle is 4π/7. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded areas are not sectors but segments. For instance, if the shaded area is the area of the large circle's segment cut off by the small circles. But this is getting too vague.

Perhaps there's a simpler approach. Let's assume that the shaded area is the area of the two sectors corresponding to the two small circles. If each small circle is tangent to the large circle, then the area of the sector corresponding to each small circle would be proportional to the angle subtended by its point of tangency. If there are seven small circles, each subtending an angle of 2π/7, then the area of one such sector is πR²/7. Two sectors would be 2πR²/7.

But if the shaded area is two such sectors, then the ratio is (2πR²/7) / (πr²) = 2R²/(7r²). Now, from the earlier relation, R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7). So:

R/r = (1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7) = 1/sin(π/7) + 1

Let me call this value k. Then, R = kr.

So R²/r² = k².

Hence, the ratio is 2k²/7.

But k = 1/sin(π/7) + 1.

So, the exact expression is 2[1 + 1/sin(π/7)]² / 7.

This seems very complicated, and I doubt that this is the expected answer. Perhaps there's a miscalculation in assuming the angle between PA and PB is 2π/7. Let me revisit the setup.

If there are seven small circles arranged around the large circle, each tangent to it and to its neighbors, then the centers of the small circles form a regular heptagon. The distance between the centers of adjacent small circles is 2r. The centers of these small circles are located at a distance of R - r from P. 

The angle between two adjacent centers of small circles, as viewed from P, is 2π/7. The distance between two adjacent centers is 2r. On the circle of radius d = R - r, the chord length between two points separated by angle α is 2d sin(α/2). So:

2d sin(α/2) = 2r → d sin(α/2) = r.

Here, α = 2π/7, so:

d sin(π/7) = r

But d = R - r, so:

(R - r) sin(π/7) = r → R sin(π/7) - r sin(π/7) = r → R sin(π/7) = r(1 + sin(π/7)) → R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7).

This confirms our previous calculation. 

Now, the area of the shaded sectors. If the shaded area is two sectors of the large circle, each with angle α = 2π/7, then total shaded area is 2*(1/2)*R²*α = R²*α. Wait, no. The area of a sector is (1/2) * R² * θ, where θ is the central angle in radians. If each sector has angle θ = 2π/7, then two sectors would have total area 2*(1/2) R² * (2π/7) = 2πR²/7.

So the shaded area is 2πR²/7. Divide by the area of one small circle, πr², giving (2πR²/7) / (πr²) = 2R²/(7r²).

Substitute R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7):

R² = r²[(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7)]²

So the ratio is 2 * [(1 + sin(π/7))² / sin²(π/7)] / 7 = 2(1 + sin(π/7))² / [7 sin²(π/7)].

This is the exact value, but it's not a nice number. However, maybe there's a simplification. Let's expand the numerator:

(1 + sin(π/7))² = 1 + 2 sin(π/7) + sin²(π/7)

So the ratio becomes:

2[1 + 2 sin(π/7) + sin²(π/7)] / [7 sin²(π/7)]

But this doesn't seem to lead to a simplification. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the shaded area is just one sector, not two. If that's the case, then the ratio would be [πR²/7]/(πr²) = R²/(7r²) = [(1 + sin(π/7))² / sin²(π/7)].

Still, this doesn't resolve to a clean number. Given that, maybe the problem assumes that the shaded area is the area of the large circle minus the areas of the small circles? Or some other configuration.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the shaded area is not part of the large circle but part of the small circles? No, the problem says the shaded portion is part of the large circle, as per the given predicates.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded sectors are the areas of the small circles. But no, the small circles are separate.

Wait, the problem says the shaded portion is how many times the area of one small circle. Let's assume that the shaded area is the area of the large circle minus the areas of the small circles. But that would be πR² - 7πr². But this seems unrelated to the given predicates.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is the area of the two small circles. But the question says the shaded portion is part of the large circle.

I'm stuck. Let me check if there's another way. 

Maybe the shaded area is the area of the two sectors formed by PA and PB, which are radii of the large circle. If the angle between PA and PB is θ, then the area is (θ/2) R². If the angle θ is such that the small circles fit into this. 

But how to find θ? If points A and B are where the small circles touch the large circle, and there are seven small circles, then the angle between PA and PB would be the angle between two adjacent points, which is 2π/7. So θ = 2π/7. Hence, the area is (2π/7)/2 * R² = πR²/7. If there are two such sectors, then it's 2πR²/7.

But how to relate R and r? From earlier, R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7). Let's plug that into the ratio:

Ratio = 2πR²/7 divided by πr² = 2R²/(7r²) = 2[(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7)]² / 7.

But this is still not a clean number. However, if we approximate sin(π/7) ≈ 0.4339, then:

1 + sin(π/7) ≈ 1.4339

Divided by sin(π/7): 1.4339 / 0.4339 ≈ 3.3047

Square that: ≈ 10.92

Multiply by 2: ≈ 21.84

Divide by 7: ≈ 3.12.

So approximately 3.12 times. But the problem likely expects an exact value, or maybe there's a simpler relationship I missed.

Wait, maybe the shaded area is not two sectors but one sector, and the angle is π/7? Let's say the shaded area is one sector with angle π/7. Then, the area is (π/7)/2 * R² = πR²/14. Then, dividing by πr² gives R²/(14r²). With R = r[1 + sin(π/7)]/sin(π/7), this would be [1 + sin(π/7)]² / [14 sin²(π/7)] ≈ (1.4339)^2 / (14 * 0.1882) ≈ 2.056 / 2.635 ≈ 0.78. Not helpful.

Alternatively, if the angle is π, then the area is (π/2) R². Ratio would be πR²/2 / πr² = R²/(2r²) = [ (1 + sin(π/7)) / sin(π/7) ]² / 2 ≈ (3.3047)^2 / 2 ≈ 10.92 / 2 ≈ 5.46. Still not clean.

At this point, I'm thinking that maybe the problem assumes that the shaded area is the area of the two small circles, but the question says the shaded portion is part of the large circle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the area of the two small circles, but this contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"The area of the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles?"

Given that the shaded portions are Sector(P,A,$) and Sector(P,B,$), which are likely two sectors of the large circle. Assuming that each sector corresponds to one small circle, and since there are seven small circles, each sector is 1/7th of the large circle. So two sectors would be 2/7th of the large circle. 

But then, the area of the shaded portion is 2/7th of the large circle. To compare this to the area of one small circle, we need to relate the area of the large circle to the small ones.

If the seven small circles are arranged around the large circle, each touching it, then the area of the large circle is πR², and the combined area of the small circles is 7πr². But this doesn't directly relate unless there's a relationship between R and r.

From earlier, R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7). Let's denote this as R = r * k, where k = (1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7). 

So, the area of the large circle is πR² = πk²r². 

The shaded area is 2/7 of this, so 2πk²r²/7. 

Compare to one small circle: πr². 

Ratio = (2πk²r²/7) / (πr²) = 2k²/7. 

With k = (1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7), this is 2[(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7)]² / 7. 

This is the same expression as before. 

But perhaps there's a way to simplify this expression. Let's expand:

k = (1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7) = 1/sin(π/7) + 1

So, k = csc(π/7) + 1

Then, k² = [csc(π/7) + 1]^2 = csc²(π/7) + 2 csc(π/7) + 1

So, the ratio is 2[csc²(π/7) + 2 csc(π/7) + 1]/7

But this doesn't seem to simplify further. 

Given that, perhaps the problem expects us to recognize that the shaded area is 2/7 of the large circle, and since the small circles are arranged such that their total area relates to the large circle, but without additional information, it's impossible to find an exact value. However, since this is a math competition-style problem, there might be a trick I'm missing.

Wait! Wait, what if the shaded area is not part of the large circle but part of the small circles? No, the problem says the shaded portion is part of the large circle. 

Wait, let me think about the area of the shaded sectors. If each small circle is tangent to the large circle, and the shaded sectors are the regions of the large circle that are not overlapped by the small circles, then the shaded area would be the area of the large circle minus the areas of the small circles. But this would be πR² - 7πr². However, the problem specifies the shaded portions are sectors, not the entire area.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the area of the large circle minus the areas of the small circles that are inside it. But again, without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to tell.

Given that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for another approach. Let's consider that the shaded area is the area of the two sectors, each with angle θ, and that the small circles are arranged such that their centers are at distance R - r from P. If the shaded area is two sectors, each with angle θ, and the total shaded area is 2*(1/2) R²θ = R²θ. 

If the small circles are arranged such that each small circle is tangent to two others and the large circle, then the angle θ between two adjacent radii is 2π/7. So θ = 2π/7. Hence, shaded area is R² * 2π/7. 

Now, to relate R and r, from earlier, R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7). 

So, R² = r²(1 + sin(π/7))² / sin²(π/7)

Substitute into the shaded area:

Shaded area = r²(1 + sin(π/7))² / sin²(π/7) * 2π/7

Divide by πr² to get the ratio:

[ (1 + sin(π/7))² / sin²(π/7) * 2π/7 ] / π = 2(1 + sin(π/7))² / [7 sin²(π/7)]

This is the same as before. 

But maybe there's a trigonometric identity I can use. Let's expand (1 + sin(π/7))²:

= 1 + 2 sin(π/7) + sin²(π/7)

So, the ratio becomes:

2[1 + 2 sin(π/7) + sin²(π/7)] / [7 sin²(π/7)]

= 2[1/sin²(π/7) + 2/sin(π/7) + 1] / 7

But this doesn't seem to simplify further.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the shaded area is one sector, and the angle is π/7, leading to a simpler calculation. Let's try that.

If the shaded area is one sector with angle π/7, then its area is (π/7)/2 * R² = πR²/14. Dividing by πr² gives R²/(14r²). Using R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7), this becomes [(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7)]² / 14. 

But even this doesn't give a clean answer.

At this point, I realize that without knowing the exact configuration or having more information, it's challenging to derive an exact value. However, considering the problem's context and typical math problems, it's possible that the intended answer is 2/7, assuming that the shaded area is two sectors each of 1/7th of the circle. But this would only be true if the angle between PA and PB is 2π/7, and the shaded area is one sector, not two.

Wait, if the shaded area is one sector with angle 2π/7, then the area is πR²/7. If this is compared to one small circle, πr², then the ratio is R²/(7r²). From earlier, R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7), so R²/r² = [1 + sin(π/7)]² / sin²(π/7). 

But this is still not a clean number. 

Wait, let me calculate this value numerically. 

Let me compute sin(π/7) ≈ 0.433884

1 + sin(π/7) ≈ 1.433884

Square of that: ≈ 2.056

Divide by sin²(π/7): 2.056 / (0.433884^2) ≈ 2.056 / 0.1882 ≈ 10.92

So, the ratio is approximately 10.92, which is close to 11. 

Given that, maybe the problem assumes that the shaded area is approximately 11 times the area of one small circle. But this is an approximation. 

However, since this is a math problem, and often such problems have elegant solutions, I might have made a wrong assumption. Let me try to think of a different approach.

Suppose that the shaded area is the area of the large circle minus the areas of the small circles. But this is speculative. Let's see: 

Total area of small circles: 7πr²

Area of large circle: πR²

If the shaded area is πR² - 7πr², then the ratio is (πR² - 7πr²)/πr² = R²/r² - 7. 

From earlier, R = r(1 + sin(π/7))/sin(π/7), so R²/r² = [1 + sin(π/7)]² / sin²(π/7) ≈ 10.92, so the ratio would be 10.92 - 7 ≈ 3.92. Still not clean.

Alternatively, if the shaded area is the area of the large circle minus the area of the small circles that overlap with it. But without knowing the exact overlap, it's hard to say.

At this point, I think the most plausible answer, despite the complexity, is that the shaded area is 2/7 of the large circle, and since the small circles are arranged such that their total
