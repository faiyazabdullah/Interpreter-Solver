MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the exact area of a figure with a radius of 5 mm. Let me start by looking at the given predicates to understand what's going on here.

First, there are points O, A, and B. Lines OA and OB are drawn, and they're both radii of a circle centered at O. That means OA and OB are both radii of the same circle, so their lengths should be equal. The LengthOf(Line(O,A)) is 5, and similarly for Line(O,B). Also, it says that the length of OA equals the length of OB, which confirms they're both radii. 

Then there's the Angle(A,O,B), which is a right angle because of the RightAngle predicate and MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,B),90). So the angle between OA and OB is 90 degrees. Also, since OA and OB are perpendicular, that tells me that the sector formed by points A, O, B is a quarter-circle? Wait, but the problem mentions Sector(O,A,B), so maybe that's referring to the sector of the circle defined by those three points?

Wait, the question says "a figure with a radius of 5 mm" – so the entire figure is likely the sector formed by OA and OB. Since OA and OB are radii of a circle with radius 5 mm, and the angle between them is 90 degrees, which is a quarter of a full circle. 

So the area of a sector of a circle is given by (θ/360) × πr², where θ is the central angle in degrees. Here, θ is 90 degrees, and r is 5 mm. Let me verify if that's correct. Alternatively, since 90 degrees is a quarter of 360, the area would be 1/4 of the area of the whole circle. The area of the whole circle is πr², so 1/4 of that would be (π*(5)^2)/4. Let me compute that. 

But wait, I need to make sure that the figure referred to is indeed the sector. The predicates mention Sector(O,A,B), which is a sector with vertex at O and points A and B on the circumference. So yes, the sector formed by angle AOB, which is 90 degrees. Therefore, the area should be 1/4 of the circle's area. 

Calculating that: Area = (1/4) * π * r². Plugging in r = 5 mm, we get (1/4)*π*25 = (25/4)π mm². Simplifying, that's 6.25π mm². But the problem asks for the exact area, so leaving it as 25π/4 is better than decimal approximation. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another component? Wait, the problem says "the given figure," which is the sector. There's no mention of other shapes like triangles or anything else. So the area should just be that of the sector. 

Let me double-check if there's any chance the problem refers to something else. The predicates include RightAngle(A,O,B), which is the angle between OA and OB. Since OA and OB are radii and form a right angle, the sector is a quarter-circle. So yeah, the area is 1/4 of the circle. 

Therefore, the exact area is (π * 5²)/4, which simplifies to 25π/4 square millimeters. 

I think that's all. No other elements are mentioned. The other predicates like Perpendicular(Line(O,A),Line(O,B)) confirm that the angle is 90 degrees, reinforcing that it's a quarter-circle sector. So the answer should be 25π/4 mm².
