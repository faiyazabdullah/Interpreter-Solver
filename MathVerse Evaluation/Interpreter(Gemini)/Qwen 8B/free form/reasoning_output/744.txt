QUESTION:
The volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere is given by the formula:

V=\frac{1}{4}\pi h\left(4r^2-h^2\right)

where r is the radius of the sphere and h is the height of the cylinder.

What is the radius of the sphere if the volume of the cylinder is 13.75\pi cm3 and the height of the cylinder is 5 cm?

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the question is about finding the radius of a sphere when given the volume of a cylinder that fits exactly inside it. The volume formula provided is V = (1/4)πh(4r² - h²), where r is the sphere's radius and h is the cylinder's height. They also mention that the cylinder's height is 5 cm and the volume is 13.75π cm³. 

First, I need to recall the relationship between a cylinder inscribed in a sphere. If a cylinder is perfectly fitted inside a sphere, there should be some geometric constraints. From what I remember, when a cylinder is inscribed in a sphere, the diagonal of the cylinder (from top to bottom through its center) would be the diameter of the sphere. But wait, maybe I need to think more carefully here.

Let me visualize this. Imagine a cylinder standing upright inside a sphere. The sphere's center would coincide with the cylinder's center. The height of the cylinder is h, so the distance from the base of the cylinder to the top is h. The radius of the cylinder's base is something we might need to find, but perhaps it relates to the sphere's radius.

Wait, but the problem gives us the height of the cylinder as 5 cm. Let me note down the given values:

Volume of cylinder, V = 13.75π cm³  
Height of cylinder, h = 5 cm  
Need to find radius of sphere, r.

But the formula given is for the volume of the cylinder in terms of the sphere's radius and the cylinder's height. Wait, but maybe I need to derive that formula? Or is it already given? The user says the formula is provided, so I can use it directly.

So substituting the known values into the formula. Let me write down the equation:

V = (1/4)πh(4r² - h²)

Plugging in V = 13.75π and h = 5:

13.75π = (1/4)π*5*(4r² - 5²)

Simplify step by step. First, divide both sides by π to eliminate it:

13.75 = (1/4)*5*(4r² - 25)

Multiply both sides by 4 to get rid of the fraction:

13.75 * 4 = 5*(4r² - 25)

Calculate left side: 13.75 * 4. Let me compute that. 13 * 4 is 52, 0.75*4 is 3, so total is 55. So:

55 = 5*(4r² - 25)

Divide both sides by 5:

11 = 4r² - 25

Then add 25 to both sides:

11 + 25 = 4r² → 36 = 4r²

Divide both sides by 4:

r² = 9 → r = √9 = 3 cm.

Wait, so the radius of the sphere is 3 cm? That seems straightforward, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. Also, did I consider the correct relation between the cylinder and the sphere?

Hold on, maybe I made an error in assuming that the given formula is directly applicable. Let me verify the derivation of that formula to ensure I'm not missing anything.

When a cylinder is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere's radius R is related to the cylinder's height h and radius a (radius of the cylinder). The relationship comes from the Pythagorean theorem. If you imagine the cylinder inside the sphere, the sphere's radius is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are half the height of the cylinder and the radius of the cylinder. So:

R² = (h/2)² + a²

But the volume of the cylinder is V = πa²h. However, the formula given in the problem is different. Let me see why.

Alternatively, maybe the formula they gave is derived considering that the maximum volume occurs at certain proportions. But since the problem states that the formula is given, I should trust it. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says "the volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere is given by..." So the formula is provided, and we can use it directly. Therefore, my previous calculation should hold.

Wait, but let me confirm again. Using the formula:

V = (1/4)πh(4r² - h²)

Given h=5, V=13.75π.

So plugging in:

13.75π = (1/4)π*5*(4r² - 25)

Cancel π:

13.75 = (5/4)(4r² - 25)

Multiply both sides by 4/5:

13.75 * (4/5) = 4r² - 25

Compute 13.75 * 4 first: 13 * 4 = 52, 0.75*4=3 → total 55. Then divide by 5: 55 / 5 = 11.

So:

11 = 4r² - 25 → 4r² = 36 → r² = 9 → r = 3 cm.

Yes, that seems consistent. But just to make sure, let me cross-validate with another approach.

Alternative approach: Suppose the sphere has radius R. The cylinder inscribed in it has height h and radius a. As per the Pythagorean theorem:

R² = (h/2)² + a² → a² = R² - (h²)/4.

Volume of cylinder is V = πa²h = π(R² - h²/4)h = πhR² - πh³/4.

Which can be written as V = πhR² - (πh³)/4. 

But according to the problem's formula, it's V = (1/4)πh(4R² - h²) → expanding this gives (πh/4)(4R² - h²) = πhR² - πh³/4, which matches the other expression. So the formula is correct.

Therefore, substituting the given values into this formula:

V = πhR² - (πh³)/4

But in our case, V is given as 13.75π, h is 5.

So:

13.75π = π*5*R² - π*(5³)/4

Divide both sides by π:

13.75 = 5R² - (125)/4

Convert 125/4 to decimal: 31.25

So:

13.75 = 5R² - 31.25

Add 31.25 to both sides:

13.75 + 31.25 = 5R² → 45 = 5R² → R² = 9 → R = 3 cm.

Same result. So regardless of the method, the radius is 3 cm. Hence, the answer is 3 cm.

But wait, the problem mentions predicates like InscribedIn(Shape($2),Circle($1)) and others. Maybe those are red herrings, or perhaps part of the setup for the problem. However, the actual problem is purely algebraic once the formula is given. Since the formula is provided, the rest is straightforward substitution.

Thus, the radius of the sphere is 3 cm.
