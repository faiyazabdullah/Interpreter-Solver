Solve for the unknown w.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. First, I need to parse all the given predicates and understand the setup. 

So, we have a right-angled triangle, which means one of the angles is 90 degrees. The problem mentions that there's a marked angle of 60°, so maybe that's one of the non-right angles. Also, there's a mention of a "right-angled side" with length 11. Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the sides are called legs and hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is opposite the right angle, and the other two sides are legs. But the term "right-angled side" might refer to one of the legs? Or perhaps it's referring to the hypotenuse? Hmm, but the problem says "the marked right angled side has a length of 11." Maybe "right-angled side" here refers to a leg adjacent to the right angle? Or maybe the hypotenuse?

Wait, looking at the predicates: IsHypotenuseOf(Line(C,A), Triangle(A,B,C)). So Line(C,A) is the hypotenuse. That would mean that the hypotenuse is CA, so points A and C form the hypotenuse. Therefore, the right angle must be at point B, because in a triangle ABC, if the hypotenuse is AC, then the right angle is at B. Let me confirm that. In a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. So if the hypotenuse is AC, then the right angle is at B. 

Now, the problem states that the marked angle is 60°, and another angle is 30°, since MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B),30). Wait, Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at point A, between points C, A, B. Wait, no: Angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at point A, formed by points C, A, B. Wait, no, wait: the standard notation is Angle(X,Y,Z) is the angle at Y between X-Y and Y-Z. So Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at point A, with segments AC and AB. Wait, but if the triangle is ABC with right angle at B, then angle at A would be one of the acute angles. Let me draw this mentally.

Let me list out all the given measures:

- RightAngle(Angle(A,B,C)): This would imply that angle at B is the right angle. Because Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at B between A-B-C. So yes, that's the right angle.

Then, MeasureOf(Angle(B,C,A), 60). Angle(B,C,A) is the angle at point C, between B-C-A. So angle at C is 60 degrees. Then MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,B), 30): Angle(C,A,B) is the angle at A, between C-A-B. So angle at A is 30 degrees. Wait, but in a triangle, the sum of angles should be 180. Let me check: right angle (90) + 60 + 30 equals 180. Yes, that works. So angles are 90° at B, 60° at C, and 30° at A. 

Now, the problem says that the marked right-angled side has length 11. Wait, the right-angled side... Wait, in a right-angled triangle, the sides adjacent to the right angle are the legs. So maybe they're referring to one of the legs. However, the problem also mentions that the diagonal side has length w. Since the hypotenuse is the diagonal side, which connects the two legs. Wait, but the hypotenuse is line CA according to the predicate IsHypotenuseOf(Line(C,A), Triangle(A,B,C)), so line CA is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the hypotenuse has length w, and one of the legs is 11. Which leg?

We need to figure out which side corresponds to the length 11. The problem says "the marked right angled side has a length of 11". The term "right angled side" might be confusing. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to a leg adjacent to the right angle. Since the right angle is at B, the legs are AB and BC. So, the legs are AB and BC, and hypotenuse AC. Now, the problem says that the marked right-angled side (maybe one of the legs?) has length 11. But how do we know which one?

Alternatively, maybe the problem refers to the hypotenuse as the "diagonal side", which is given as length w. Wait, the problem says "the diagonal side has a length of w". So the diagonal side is the hypotenuse, which is CA. Therefore, the hypotenuse is w. And the marked right-angled side (one of the legs) is 11. But which leg?

Looking back at the predicates: LengthOf(Line(A,B), 11). So Line(A,B) has length 11. So AB is 11. So AB is one of the legs. Since the right angle is at B, AB and BC are the legs. So AB is 11. Then BC is the other leg, and AC is the hypotenuse, which is w. Wait, but the problem says "the marked right angled side has a length of 11"—if AB is 11, then AB is a leg. So maybe that's the one referred to as the right-angled side. 

Given that, we can model the triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90°, with the right angle at B. So angle at A is 30°, angle at C is 60°, angle at B is 90°. The side opposite the 30° angle is BC, the side opposite the 60° angle is AB, and the hypotenuse AC is opposite the right angle. Wait, no: in a triangle, the side opposite an angle is named after the opposite vertex. So:

- Angle at A is 30°, so the side opposite is BC.
- Angle at B is 90°, so the side opposite is AC (hypotenuse).
- Angle at C is 60°, so the side opposite is AB.

Therefore, AB is opposite angle C (which is 60°). So AB is the side opposite the 60° angle. Given that AB is 11, and we need to find the hypotenuse AC (which is w).

But in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Specifically, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, and 90° are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. 

Here, angle at A is 30°, so the side opposite (BC) is the shortest side, length x. The side opposite 60° (angle at C) is AB, which is 11. So AB corresponds to the longer leg, which is √3 times the shorter leg. Wait, let's clarify:

If angle at A is 30°, then the side opposite (BC) is the shorter leg. The side opposite angle C (60°) is AB, which is the longer leg. Hypotenuse AC is twice the shorter leg. 

So, if AB (longer leg) is 11, then the shorter leg BC = AB / √3 = 11 / √3. Then the hypotenuse AC is 2*(shorter leg) = 2*(11 / √3) = 22 / √3. Rationalizing the denominator, that would be (22√3)/3. 

But wait, let me check again. Let me recall the ratios properly. In a 30-60-90 triangle:

- The side opposite 30° is the shortest leg, let's call it 'a'.
- The side opposite 60° is the longer leg, which is a√3.
- The hypotenuse is 2a.

So, if AB is the side opposite 60°, then AB = a√3. If AB is 11, then a = 11 / √3. The hypotenuse is 2a = 2*(11 / √3) = 22 / √3, which simplifies to (22√3)/3. Therefore, the hypotenuse w is (22√3)/3. 

Alternatively, maybe I mixed up which side is which. Let me verify again.

In our case, angle at A is 30°, so the side opposite to angle A is BC. Therefore, BC is the side opposite 30°, making it the shorter leg. The side opposite angle C (60°) is AB. So AB is longer leg. Hypotenuse is AC. Therefore, hypotenuse AC = 2*BC. And AB = BC * √3. 

Since AB is given as 11, then BC = AB / √3 = 11 / √3. Then hypotenuse AC = 2 * BC = 22 / √3. Multiply numerator and denominator by √3: (22√3)/3. So w = (22√3)/3 ≈ 12.7, but exact value is 22√3 over 3.

But let me cross-validate using trigonometry. In triangle ABC, right-angled at B. So tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent. Angle at A is 30°, so tan(30°) = BC / AB. Wait, angle at A is 30°, so the opposite side is BC, adjacent side is AB. Therefore:

tan(30°) = BC / AB => 1/√3 = BC / 11 => BC = 11 / √3. Then hypotenuse AC can be found via Pythagoras: AB² + BC² = AC². 

Calculating:

AB² = 11² = 121

BC² = (11 / √3)² = 121 / 3

Sum: 121 + 121/3 = (363 + 121)/3 = 484 / 3

Thus AC = sqrt(484/3) = 22 / √3 = (22√3)/3. Same result. 

Therefore, the value of w is (22√3)/3. 

So the final answer should be boxed as such.
