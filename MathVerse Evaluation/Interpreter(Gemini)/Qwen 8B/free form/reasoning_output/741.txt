QUESTION:
A cylinder has a surface area of 54105 \mathrm{mm}^2 and a radius of 79 mm.

What must the height h mm of the cylinder be?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the height h of a cylinder given its surface area and radius. Let me recall the formula for the surface area of a cylinder. Hmm, I think it's the sum of the areas of the two circular bases plus the lateral surface area. 

Wait, the formula is 2πr² + 2πrh. Right? Because each base is a circle with area πr², so two of them would be 2πr². Then the lateral surface area is the circumference of the base times the height, which is 2πr multiplied by h, giving 2πrh. So altogether, the total surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh. 

The problem states that the surface area is 54105 mm² and the radius is 79 mm. We need to find the height h. Let me write down the equation:

Surface Area = 2πr² + 2πrh  
Given that SA = 54105 and r = 79, plug those values in.

So substituting the numbers:

54105 = 2π*(79)² + 2π*79*h

Now, I need to solve for h. Let me compute each part step by step. First, calculate 2π*(79)². Let me compute 79 squared first. 79*79... Well, 80² is 6400, subtract 2*80 +1 because (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b². Wait, maybe easier just to multiply 79*79. Let me do that:

79*79 = (70 + 9)(70 + 9) = 70² + 2*70*9 + 9² = 4900 + 1260 + 81 = 4900 + 1260 is 6160, plus 81 is 6241. So 79² = 6241. Then multiply by 2π: 2π*6241. Let me note that as 12482π. 

Then the other term is 2π*79*h, which is 158πh. So putting it all together:

54105 = 12482π + 158πh

Hmm, okay. Now I need to solve for h. Let me rearrange the equation. Subtract 12482π from both sides:

54105 - 12482π = 158πh

Then divide both sides by 158π:

h = (54105 - 12482π) / (158π)

But wait, maybe there's another way. Alternatively, factor out 2πr from the original equation. Let me check:

Original equation: SA = 2πr(r + h). Wait, no. Wait, 2πr² + 2πrh = 2πr(r + h). Yes! That's correct. So factoring gives us SA = 2πr(r + h). Therefore, solving for h:

SA = 2πr(r + h)  
Divide both sides by 2πr:  
SA/(2πr) = r + h  
Subtract r from both sides:  
h = SA/(2πr) - r

That seems simpler. Let me try this approach instead. Maybe less error-prone.

So plugging in the numbers:

SA = 54105, r = 79.

Compute SA/(2πr): 54105 divided by (2π*79). Let me compute denominator first: 2*π*79 ≈ 2*3.1416*79. Let me calculate that. But maybe better to keep exact terms for calculation.

Alternatively, let's compute numerically. Let me compute 2πr first. 2 * π * 79. Let me compute 2*79=158. So 158π. So SA/(158π) equals (54105)/(158π). Then subtract r (which is 79) to get h.

So h = (54105)/(158π) - 79.

Let me compute that. First, compute 54105 divided by 158π. Let me calculate 54105 ÷ 158 first, then divide by π. Or perhaps compute 54105 divided by (158π).

But since π is approximately 3.1415926535..., let me compute 158π ≈ 158 * 3.1416 ≈ let's see:

First compute 150π ≈ 471.2389, and 8π ≈ 25.1327, so total ≈ 471.2389 + 25.1327 ≈ 496.3716. So approx 496.3716.

Therefore, 54105 divided by 496.3716. Let me compute that division.

First, approximate 54105 ÷ 496.37. Let me estimate how many times 496.37 fits into 54105.

Well, 496.37 * 100 = 49,637. So 49,637 is 100 times. Then 54,105 - 49,637 = 4,468. So that's about 100 + (4,468 / 496.37). Let me compute 4,468 ÷ 496.37 ≈ roughly 9. So total approx 109. So h ≈ 109 - 79 = 30? Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the entire expression is h = (54105 / 158π ) - 79. So if 54105 / 158π ≈ 109, then h ≈ 109 - 79 = 30. But this is rough estimation. Need more precise calculation.

Alternatively, let's do exact computation step by step.

First, compute 158π. Let me take π as 3.1415926535...

158 * π ≈ 158 * 3.1415926535 ≈ ?

Let me compute 158 × 3.1415926535:

Breakdown:

158 × 3 = 474

158 × 0.1415926535 ≈ ?

First compute 158 × 0.1 = 15.8

158 × 0.04 = 6.32

158 × 0.0015926535 ≈ approx 158 × 0.0016 ≈ 0.2528

Adding up these components:

0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0015926535 ≈ 0.1415926535, so yes.

So adding the parts:

15.8 + 6.32 = 22.12 + 0.2528 ≈ 22.3728

Thus total 158π ≈ 474 + 22.3728 ≈ 496.3728

So 158π ≈ 496.3728

Now compute 54105 divided by 496.3728:

Let me perform this division.

First, divide numerator and denominator by something? Not sure. Let me compute 54105 ÷ 496.3728.

Let me approximate this division. Let me consider that 496.3728 × 109 = ?

Well, 496.3728 × 100 = 49,637.28

496.3728 × 9 = 4,467.3552

Total 49,637.28 + 4,467.3552 ≈ 54,104.6352

Wow! That's very close to 54,105. So 496.3728 × 109 ≈ 54,104.6352, which is almost exactly 54,105. So 54105 / 496.3728 ≈ 109. Therefore, h ≈ 109 - 79 = 30. So h ≈ 30 mm. But let me check precisely.

Since 496.3728 × 109 ≈ 54,104.6352, which is slightly less than 54,105. The difference is 54,105 - 54,104.6352 = 0.3648. So how much more than 109 is needed? Since 496.3728 × x = 0.3648, where x is the small increment. So x ≈ 0.3648 / 496.3728 ≈ ~0.000734. So total multiplier is 109.000734. Therefore, 54105 / 496.3728 ≈ 109.000734. Thus, h ≈ 109.000734 - 79 = 30.000734. So approximately 30.0007 mm. Rounded to the nearest whole number, that's 30 mm.

But wait, let me verify once again. Because maybe my approximation was too rough. Let me check with more accurate calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should carry out the exact calculation without approximating π early on.

Starting over:

We have h = (54105 / (2π*79)) - 79.

Let me compute 2π*79 first. Which is 158π. Then 54105 divided by 158π minus 79.

So compute 54105 / (158π):

Let me calculate this fraction. Let me write it as 54105/(158π). Let me compute this value numerically with higher precision.

Using calculator-like steps:

First, compute π ≈ 3.141592653589793.

Calculate 158π:

158 * π ≈ 158 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ let's compute this accurately.

Breaking down:

158 * 3 = 474

158 * 0.141592653589793 ≈ ?

Let me compute 158 * 0.1 = 15.8

158 * 0.04 = 6.32

158 * 0.001592653589793 ≈ ?

First, 0.001592653589793 * 158 ≈ 0.001592653589793 * 158 ≈ approximately 0.252. Let me compute 0.001592653589793 * 158:

Multiply 158 * 0.001 = 0.158

158 * 0.000592653589793 ≈ 158 * 0.00059265 ≈ 0.0938. So total approx 0.158 + 0.0938 ≈ 0.2518.

So adding all parts: 15.8 + 6.32 = 22.12 + 0.2518 ≈ 22.3718. Hence total 158π ≈ 474 + 22.3718 = 496.3718.

So 158π ≈ 496.3718.

Now compute 54105 / 496.3718 ≈ ?

As before, this is approximately 109.0007. So 54105 / 158π ≈ 109.0007.

Then subtract 79: 109.0007 - 79 = 30.0007.

So h ≈ 30.0007 mm. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 30 mm.

But let me confirm this with a different approach. Suppose I use more accurate decimal expansions.

Alternatively, use calculator input:

Let me compute 54105 divided by (2 * π * 79) minus 79.

First compute 2 * π * 79:

2 * π * 79 = 158π ≈ 158 * 3.1415926535 ≈ 496.3718...

So 54105 divided by 496.3718 is approximately:

Let me do this division properly. Let me write 54105 ÷ 496.3718.

Let me compute 496.3718 × 109 = 496.3718 × 100 + 496.3718 × 9 = 49,637.18 + 4,467.3462 = 54,104.5262.

Which is very close to 54,105. The difference is 54,105 - 54,104.5262 = 0.4738.

So to find how much more than 109 is required:

Additional value needed: 0.4738 / 496.3718 ≈ 0.4738 / 496.3718 ≈ 0.000955.

Thus, total multiplier is 109 + 0.000955 ≈ 109.000955.

Therefore, 54105 / (158π) ≈ 109.000955.

Then h = 109.000955 - 79 = 30.000955 mm.

So h ≈ 30.000955 mm. Rounded to the nearest whole number, that's 30 mm. 

But let me check if there's any rounding errors due to approximated π. Maybe I should carry out the calculation with more precise π value or use fractions.

Alternatively, maybe there's an exact fractional approach. However, since π is irrational, we can't get an exact value, but we can compute it with sufficient precision.

Another way: Let me use more decimal places for π. Let me take π ≈ 3.141592653589793.

So 158π = 158 × 3.141592653589793.

Let me compute that more accurately:

First, 158 × 3 = 474.

158 × 0.141592653589793.

Let me compute 158 × 0.1 = 15.8

158 × 0.04 = 6.32

158 × 0.001592653589793 ≈ 158 × 0.001592653589793 ≈ Let me compute 0.001592653589793 × 158.

Multiplying 0.001592653589793 × 158:

First, 0.001 × 158 = 0.158

0.0005 × 158 = 0.079

0.000092653589793 × 158 ≈ approx 0.0146.

So total ≈ 0.158 + 0.079 + 0.0146 ≈ 0.2516.

So total of 15.8 + 6.32 + 0.2516 ≈ 22.3716.

Hence, 158π ≈ 474 + 22.3716 = 496.3716.

So same as before. Then 54105 / 496.3716 ≈ ?

Let me perform this division with more precision. Let me write 54105 ÷ 496.3716.

Let me express this as:

Let me denote D = 496.3716.

We know that D × 109 = 54,104.5264 (from earlier). The actual numerator is 54,105. So the difference is 54,105 - 54,104.5264 = 0.4736.

To find how much more than 109 we need to add to D to get the desired value:

Let x be such that D × (109 + x) = 54,105.

Expanding: D × 109 + D × x = 54,105 → D × x = 0.4736 → x = 0.4736 / D ≈ 0.4736 / 496.3716 ≈ 0.0009545.

So total multiplier is 109 + 0.0009545 ≈ 109.0009545.

Thus, 54105 / D ≈ 109.0009545.

Then h = 109.0009545 - 79 = 30.0009545 mm.

Rounded to the nearest whole number, that's 30 mm. So the height h is approximately 30 mm.

But let me check with another method. Let's compute using exact fractions.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming the formula? Let me recheck the surface area formula for a cylinder.

Yes, the total surface area of a closed cylinder (with top and bottom) is indeed 2πr² + 2πrh. So that's correct. So our setup is correct.

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding of the problem? The problem says "surface area" which typically refers to total surface area, including both bases. If it were only the lateral surface area, the formula would be different. But the problem mentions "surface area", which usually includes all surfaces. Also, the given answer options suggest that the calculation leads to around 30, which matches our result.

Another sanity check: if the radius is 79 mm, and the surface area is 54105 mm², then the height being 30 mm seems reasonable. Let me compute the surface area with h = 30 to see if it's close.

Compute SA = 2πr² + 2πrh = 2π*(79²) + 2π*79*30.

Calculate 79² = 6241, so 2π*6241 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 6241 ≈ 6.2832 * 6241 ≈ let's compute that.

First, 6 * 6241 = 37,446.

0.2832 * 6241 ≈ ?

Well, 0.2 * 6241 = 1,248.2

0.08 * 6241 = 499.28

0.0032 * 6241 ≈ 19.9712

Total ≈ 1,248.2 + 499.28 = 1,747.48 + 19.9712 ≈ 1,767.45.

So total 2πr² ≈ 37,446 + 1,767.45 ≈ 39,213.45 mm².

Then compute 2πrh: 2π*79*30 = 2π*2370 = 4740π ≈ 4740 * 3.1416 ≈ let's compute 4740 * 3 = 14,220; 4740 * 0.1416 ≈ 4740 * 0.1 = 474; 4740 * 0.04 = 189.6; 4740 * 0.0016 ≈ 7.584. Total ≈ 474 + 189.6 = 663.6 + 7.584 ≈ 671.184. So total ≈ 14,220 + 671.184 ≈ 14,891.184 mm².

Total SA ≈ 39,213.45 + 14,891.184 ≈ 54,104.63 mm². Which is extremely close to the given 54,105 mm². The slight discrepancy is due to rounding during intermediate steps. This confirms that h ≈ 30 mm is correct.

Therefore, the height h must be approximately 30 mm when rounded to the nearest whole number.
