QUESTION:

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have two curves here: y₁ is given as x³, which passes through the origin (0,0). Then there's another curve y₂, which is described as a vertical or horizontal translation of y₁, and it passes through the point (-2, 0). Also, the blue line is solid and the red one is dotted. The question asks for the equation of y₂ as shown in the graph.

First, I need to recall what a vertical or horizontal translation does to a function. If you translate a graph horizontally, you replace x with (x - h) or (x + h), depending on the direction. Similarly, a vertical translation would involve adding or subtracting a constant to the entire function. 

Given that y₁ is x³, which is a cubic function. Its standard form is y = x³. Now, y₂ is a translation of this. Since it passes through (-2, 0), which is different from the original point (0,0) where y₁ passes through. Let me think about how translations affect points.

If we consider a horizontal translation, shifting the graph left or right. Suppose we have a horizontal shift. Let's say the original function is y = f(x). A horizontal shift to the left by 'a' units would be y = f(x + a), and a shift to the right by 'a' units would be y = f(x - a). Alternatively, if it's a vertical shift, it would be y = f(x) + b or y = f(x) - b.

But since the point (-2, 0) lies on y₂, maybe we can find the translation. Let's suppose that y₂ is obtained by translating y₁ either horizontally or vertically. But the problem says "vertical or horizontal translation," so it could be either. However, looking at the given equations for y₁ and y₂:

The user provided Equals(y1, Pow(x,3)) which is y₁ = x³, and Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3)). Wait, hold on. Wait, the user wrote "Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3))". Wait, but that would mean y₂ = (x + 2)³? But that seems like a horizontal translation. Because replacing x with x + 2 shifts the graph left by 2 units. Let me check that.

Original function y = x³. If we replace x with x + 2, we get y = (x + 2)³. That would shift the graph left by 2 units. So, the point (0,0) on the original graph would move to (-2, 0). Which matches the given condition that y₂ passes through (-2, 0). Therefore, that seems correct.

Wait, but why did they mention vertical or horizontal translation? Because a horizontal translation would be shifting left/right, whereas vertical would be up/down. In this case, the translation is horizontal because we're replacing x with x + 2. So, the equation of y₂ is (x + 2)³. Let me confirm the logic again.

Original y₁ = x³ passes through (0,0). After horizontal shift left by 2 units, the new function is y = (x + 2)³. Plugging x = -2 into this gives y = (-2 + 2)³ = 0³ = 0. Hence, the point (-2, 0) is indeed on y₂. That fits with the given conditions.

Alternatively, if it were a vertical translation, say y = x³ + k. To pass through (-2, 0), substituting x=-2, y=0: 0 = (-2)^3 + k → 0 = -8 + k → k=8. Then y₂ would be y = x³ + 8. However, in that case, the point (0, 8) would be on y₂, not sure if that's conflicting with anything else. But the problem states that the red line is dotted, perhaps indicating that it's a horizontal translation? Or maybe not necessarily. But according to the given Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3)), the answer is (x + 2)^3. 

Wait, but the user is giving us the predicates. Let me check again. The problem says "Write an equation for y₂ as shown in the graph." Given that the graph shows y₁ = x³ passing through (0,0) and y₂ passing through (-2, 0). The options for y₂ are given as either a vertical or horizontal translation. 

So, considering that the original function is y = x³, and after a horizontal translation left by 2 units, we get y = (x + 2)^3. This would make the graph pass through (-2, 0). Alternatively, a vertical translation would require adjusting the y-value, but the problem mentions that the red line is dotted. Maybe the problem wants us to recognize that the translation is horizontal, hence the equation is (x + 2)^3. 

Therefore, the answer should be y = (x + 2)^3, which in LaTeX is y = (x + 2)^3. Let me check once more. The given Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3)) is part of the problem's predicates, but wait, no—the user says that the question is to write the equation for y₂ as shown in the graph. The given predicates include that Equals(y2, Pow(Add(x,2),3))? Wait, no. Wait, the initial problem statement says:

" GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0),Line(x,y))
Blue(Line(y1))
Red(Line(y2))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-2,0),Line(x,y))
Equals(y1,Pow(x,3))
Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3))"

Wait, so the Equals(y2, ...) is given as part of the predicates. Wait, but that would mean that the equation for y2 is already given as (x + 2)^3. But that seems contradictory. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again.

Looking back at the problem:

The user lists the given predicates. One of them is Equals(y1,Pow(x,3)) which defines y1 as x³. Another is Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3)), which would define y2 as (x + 2)^3. However, the question says "Write an equation for y₂ as shown in the graph." So perhaps this is a trick question where the answer is directly given by the predicate? But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe the user intended that the equation for y2 is to be determined based on the graph, but the given predicate includes that equals(y2, ...). But that would make the answer straightforward.

Wait, but maybe the user made a typo. Let me re-examine the problem. The user writes:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
...
Equals(y1,Pow(x,3))
Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3))"

But then the question is to write the equation for y2 as shown in the graph. So if these are given as part of the problem's setup, then the answer would just be y2 = (x + 2)^3. But that feels too easy. However, maybe the problem is testing understanding of translations. Let me think again.

Suppose the user is providing the predicates as part of the problem. The PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x,y)) indicates that the line y = x³ passes through (0,0). Then Blue(Line(y1)) refers to the blue line being y1, which is y = x³. Red(Line(y2)) refers to the red line being y2. PointLiesOnLine(Point(-2,0), Line(x,y)) means that the line (which is y2) passes through (-2,0). Then the Equals(y1,Pow(x,3)) is confirming that y1 is x³, and Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3)) is stating that y2 is (x + 2)^3. But then the question is to write the equation for y2 as shown in the graph. So perhaps the answer is simply (x + 2)^3. 

But why was the problem presented as needing reasoning? Maybe the user made a mistake in including that predicate. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to derive the equation of y2 based on the given conditions, not just take it from the predicate. Let me re-read the problem carefully.

The problem says: "The graph shows y₁=x³ passing (0,0) and a vertical or horizontal translation y₂ passing (-2,0). The blue line is solid while the red line is dotted. Write an equation for y₂ as shown in the graph."

So the given data is that y₁ is x³, passing through (0,0). y₂ is a vertical or horizontal translation of y₁, passing through (-2,0). The blue line (y₁) is solid, red line (y₂) is dotted. So, the user needs to find the equation of y₂.

In that case, the answer would be found by determining the translation. As earlier, since y₁ is x³, and y₂ is a horizontal or vertical translation. Let's see:

Case 1: Horizontal translation. Let’s assume it's shifted left by 2 units. Then y₂ = (x + 2)^3. Testing the point (-2,0): plug x=-2, y=( -2 + 2 )³ = 0³ = 0. Correct. So that works.

Case 2: Vertical translation. Suppose it's shifted down by some amount. Let's say y₂ = x³ + k. Passes through (-2, 0): 0 = (-2)^3 + k ⇒ 0 = -8 + k ⇒ k = 8. So y₂ = x³ + 8. Then, checking if this makes sense. The point (-2, 0) is on y₂, yes. But then, the graph would cross the y-axis at (0, 8). However, the problem says the red line is dotted. But without more info, both possibilities exist. However, the problem mentions that the graph shows y₂ as a translation. Translations can be horizontal or vertical. How do we know which one?

But the given predicates also include Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3)), which would be the horizontal translation. But if that's part of the problem's given, then the answer is that. However, if that's not given, then we need to infer. But according to the problem's structure, the user is providing the predicates as part of the problem. Wait, but in the original problem description, the user wrote:

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
...
Equals(y1,Pow(x,3))
Equals(y2,Pow(Add(x,2),3))"

So the problem is giving us that y2 is equal to (x + 2)^3. Therefore, the answer is simply that equation. However, the way the question is phrased suggests that we are supposed to derive it. There may be confusion here. But given the presence of the predicate Equals(y2,...), it's likely that the answer is (x + 2)^3. 

However, if we ignore that predicate and focus on the problem's narrative, the answer would still be (x + 2)^3. So regardless, the conclusion is that the equation is y = (x + 2)^3. Thus, the final answer is y = (x + 2)^3, which in LaTeX is written as y = (x + 2)^3.
