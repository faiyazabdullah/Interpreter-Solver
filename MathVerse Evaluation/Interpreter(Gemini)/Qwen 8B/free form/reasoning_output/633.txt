QUESTION:
The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of $y=\sin x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(90^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=5 \sin x$

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the first maximum point of the function y = 5 sin x for x ≥ 0. They mentioned that the original sine function y = sin x has its first maximum at (90°, 1). Now, we need to consider the transformation applied when multiplying the sine function by 5.

First, I should recall how transformations affect the graph of a trigonometric function. Specifically, vertical scaling. If you have y = A sin x, the amplitude becomes |A|. The amplitude is the maximum value from the midline. So, if the original sine function has an amplitude of 1, multiplying by 5 would make the amplitude 5. That means the maximum value of y would be 5 instead of 1, but the x-coordinate where the maximum occurs should remain the same because there's no horizontal shift or compression/stretching involved here. 

Wait, the problem says "consider the transformation that has taken place." Since the original function is y = sin x, and the new one is y = 5 sin x. This is a vertical stretch by a factor of 5. Vertical stretches don't affect the x-values where maxima and minima occur. Therefore, the first maximum should still happen at the same x-value as the original function, which is 90°, but the y-value would be multiplied by 5. 

So, the original maximum point was (90°, 1). After stretching vertically by 5, the y-coordinate becomes 5*1 = 5. Hence, the new maximum point should be (90°, 5). Let me check if there's anything else I need to consider. 

The problem also mentions that the sine function is symmetric about the origin, which is inherent in the standard sine function. But since we're only applying a vertical scaling here, symmetry about the origin remains unaffected. The maximum point is still at 90°, and the minimum would be at 270°, but the question specifically asks for the first maximum point for x ≥ 0. 

Therefore, the coordinates should be (90°, 5). Let me confirm with another perspective. The general form y = A sin(Bx + C) + D. In our case, A is 5, B is 1, C is 0, D is 0. The period is 2π/B, which is 2π here, so the period remains the same. The phase shift is -C/B, which is 0. The vertical shift is D, which is 0. So, the maximum occurs at x = π/2 (which is 90°) plus any phase shifts, but there are none. Thus, the maximum is indeed at 90°, and the y-value is A times the original maximum, which is 5. 

I think that's solid. No other transformations like horizontal shifts or reflections are present here. So the conclusion is that the first maximum point is at (90°, 5).
