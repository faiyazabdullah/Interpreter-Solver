Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the equation of an ellipse that intersects the x-axis at -0.5 and -3.5, and the y-axis at 2. Hmm, ellipses... I remember they have standard equations, but I need to recall exactly how to derive them based on intercepts.

First, let me think about the general form of an ellipse. If it's centered at the origin, the standard equation would be (x²/a²) + (y²/b²) = 1, where 'a' is the semi-major axis and 'b' the semi-minor axis. But wait, if the ellipse isn't centered at the origin, the equation would involve shifts. However, the problem mentions intercepts on the axes. Let me check the given points.

The ellipse intersects the x-axis at (-0.5, 0) and (-3.5, 0). That means these are the x-intercepts. Similarly, it intersects the y-axis at (0, 2), so that's the y-intercept. Wait, but an ellipse can have two y-intercepts? Or maybe just one here? Since the problem states "intersects with y-axis at 2," perhaps there's only one point? Maybe it's tangent to the y-axis? Or maybe there are two points symmetric?

Wait, no. If it's intersecting the y-axis at 2, that could mean the point (0, 2) lies on the ellipse. So, substituting x=0 into the ellipse equation gives y²/b² = 1, so y = ±b. Therefore, if the ellipse crosses the y-axis at 2, then b should be 2? But maybe the ellipse is not centered at the origin. Because if the center is not at the origin, then the standard form would be ((x-h)²/a²) + ((y-k)²/b²) = 1. 

But given that the ellipse intersects the x-axis at -0.5 and -3.5, those are the roots of the equation when y=0. Let me consider that. If we plug y=0 into the ellipse equation, we get ((x-h)²)/a² + ((k)²)/b² = 1. Wait, no. Actually, when y=0, the equation becomes ((x-h)²)/a² = 1 - ((k)²)/b². So solving for x, we get x = h ± sqrt(a²[1 - k²/b²]). Hmm, but maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, maybe the ellipse is symmetric with respect to the x-axis and y-axis? Not necessarily, unless it's centered at the origin.

Alternatively, since the ellipse has x-intercepts at -0.5 and -3.5, those are the points where the ellipse meets the x-axis. Similarly, the y-intercept is at (0,2). Let me try assuming that the ellipse is centered at some point (h,k). Then, the general equation is ((x-h)^2)/a^2 + ((y-k)^2)/b^2 = 1. 

Now, plugging in the intercepts. First, the x-intercepts are at y=0. So plugging y=0 into the equation:

((x - h)^2)/a^2 + (k^2)/b^2 = 1.

This quadratic equation in x would have solutions at x = h ± sqrt(a^2[1 - (k^2)/b^2]). These solutions correspond to the x-intercepts given as -0.5 and -3.5. So the distance between these two points is the difference between the roots. The roots are h + sqrt(...) and h - sqrt(...). The difference between them is 2*sqrt(...). Let me compute that. The difference between the two x-intercepts is (-0.5) - (-3.5) = 3. So the distance between them is 3. Thus, 2*sqrt(a^2[1 - (k^2)/b^2]) = 3. Which implies sqrt(a^2[1 - (k^2)/b^2]) = 3/2. Squaring both sides: a^2[1 - (k^2)/b^2] = 9/4.

Similarly, the y-intercept is at (0, 2). Plugging x=0 into the ellipse equation:

(( - h)^2)/a^2 + ((2 - k)^2)/b^2 = 1. So (h^2)/a^2 + ((2 - k)^2)/b^2 = 1.

Hmm, but without knowing h and k, this seems underdetermined. Maybe there's another assumption we can make? Like, maybe the ellipse is centered at the midpoint of the x-intercepts? Wait, the x-intercepts are at -0.5 and -3.5. Their midpoint is (-0.5 + (-3.5))/2 = (-4)/2 = -2. So the center's x-coordinate is -2? But then, if the ellipse is symmetric around its center, then the y-intercept would be determined by the vertical axis. Wait, but the y-intercept is at (0, 2). If the center is at (-2, k), then the horizontal axis is along the line y=k. But the y-intercept is at (0, 2), which would imply that the vertical axis might be shifted. This seems complicated. Maybe I need more constraints.

Alternatively, perhaps the ellipse is not rotated and is aligned with the coordinate axes. In that case, the major and minor axes are parallel to the x and y axes. Then, the standard form would be ((x-h)^2)/a^2 + ((y-k)^2)/b^2 = 1, with center (h, k).

If that's the case, then the x-intercepts occur when y=0. So plugging y=0:

((x-h)^2)/a^2 + (k^2)/b^2 = 1 => ((x-h)^2)/a^2 = 1 - (k^2)/b^2. So the x-values are h ± sqrt[a^2(1 - k^2/b^2)]. These x-values are given as -0.5 and -3.5. So the average of these x-values is (-0.5 + (-3.5))/2 = -2. So h = -2. So the center is at (-2, k). Now, the distance between the x-intercepts is 3 units (from -0.5 to -3.5 is 3 units apart). Therefore, the distance between the roots is 2*a', where a' is the semi-axis length along the x-direction. Wait, but the formula for the roots is h ± sqrt[a^2(1 - k^2/b^2)].

So the difference between the roots is 2*sqrt[a^2(1 - k^2/b^2)] = 3. Hence,

sqrt[a^2(1 - k^2/b^2)] = 3/2 => a^2(1 - k^2/b^2) = 9/4.

Also, the y-intercept is at (0, 2). So plugging x=0, y=2 into the ellipse equation:

[(0 + 2)^2]/a^2 + [(2 - k)^2]/b^2 = 1 => 4/a^2 + (2 - k)^2 / b^2 = 1.

But we also know that the ellipse's y-intercept is at 2. If the ellipse is symmetric about its center, then the y-intercept might relate to the vertical axis. But since the center is at (-2, k), the vertical axis is along y = k. So the maximum and minimum y-values would be k ± b. But the y-intercept is at (0, 2), which is a point on the ellipse. So substituting (0, 2):

[(0 + 2)^2]/a^2 + [(2 - k)^2]/b^2 = 1.

But without knowing k, this is still tricky. Perhaps we need another condition. Also, the ellipse has another intercept on the y-axis. Wait, does it cross the y-axis at only one point? Or is there another intercept? If it's a standard ellipse aligned with axes, then when x=0, the equation gives two y-values. But the problem says "intersects with y-axis at 2". So maybe it's tangent to the y-axis at 2? Or maybe it's passing through (0, 2) as one of the intercepts. But in that case, there might be another y-intercept. However, the problem mentions only one y-intercept, so perhaps it's tangent? Or maybe the ellipse is not symmetric vertically. Wait, but if the ellipse is centered at (-2, k), then the y-axis intercept would depend on k. 

Alternatively, maybe the ellipse is actually a circle? No, because the x-intercepts are different distances from the origin. A circle centered at (-2, k) would have radius such that the distance from center to x-axis intercepts equals the radius. But the x-intercepts are at -0.5 and -3.5. Let me see. If it were a circle, then the distance from the center to each x-intercept would be the same. Let me check. Suppose the center is at (-2, k). The distance from (-2, k) to (-0.5, 0) is sqrt[(-0.5 + 2)^2 + (0 - k)^2] = sqrt[(1.5)^2 + k^2]. Similarly, the distance to (-3.5, 0) is sqrt[(-3.5 + 2)^2 + (0 - k)^2] = sqrt[(-1.5)^2 + k^2] = same as before. So yes, if it's a circle, then both x-intercepts are equidistant from the center, which makes sense. But the problem says it's an ellipse, not necessarily a circle. But maybe in this case, it's a circle. Wait, but the y-intercept is at (0, 2). Let me check if that's consistent with being a circle. So if it's a circle with center (-2, k), radius r, then the distance from center to (0, 2) must also be r. So:

sqrt[(0 + 2)^2 + (2 - k)^2] = r.

But also, from earlier, the distance from center to x-intercepts is r. So:

sqrt[(1.5)^2 + k^2] = r.

Therefore, equating the two expressions for r:

sqrt[1.5² + k²] = sqrt[2² + (2 - k)^2].

Square both sides:

(2.25) + k² = 4 + (2 - k)^2.

Expand the right side: 4 + 4 - 4k + k² = 8 -4k + k².

Left side: 2.25 + k².

Set equal:

2.25 + k² = 8 -4k + k² → subtract k² from both sides:

2.25 = 8 -4k → rearrange:

4k = 8 - 2.25 = 5.75 → k = 5.75 / 4 = 1.4375 = 1.4375. So k = 1.4375.

Then, radius squared is 1.5² + k² = 2.25 + (1.4375)^2. Let me calculate that. 1.4375 squared is (approx): 1.4375 * 1.4375. Well, 1.4375 = 1 + 0.4375 = 1 + 7/16. So (1 + 7/16)^2 = 1 + 14/16 + 49/256 ≈ 1 + 0.875 + 0.1914 ≈ 2.0664. Adding 2.25 gives total radius squared ≈ 4.3164. 

But then, the y-intercept is (0, 2). Wait, but if the center is at (-2, 1.4375), then the distance from the center to (0, 2) is sqrt[(0 + 2)^2 + (2 - 1.4375)^2] = sqrt[4 + (0.5625)^2] = sqrt[4 + 0.3164] = sqrt(4.3164) ≈ 2.077, which matches the radius. So this suggests that the shape is a circle. However, the problem says it's an ellipse. So maybe it's a circle, which is a special case of an ellipse. But the problem didn't specify that it's not a circle. So maybe the answer is a circle. However, the original question says "ellipse", so perhaps it's intended to be a non-circular ellipse. But given the data, it's possible that it's a circle. Let me verify with the given points.

But wait, the problem says "the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at -0.5 and -3.5 and with y-axis at 2". So maybe the ellipse is not a circle. Let me think again. If it's an ellipse, then the x-intercepts and y-intercept give us enough info to find the equation. But how?

Let me go back. Assuming the ellipse is not a circle. So general equation ((x - h)^2)/a² + ((y - k)^2)/b² = 1. We have two intercepts. From the x-intercepts, we found that the center's x-coordinate h is -2. So h = -2. Now, the x-intercepts are at (-0.5, 0) and (-3.5, 0). Let me plug these into the ellipse equation.

For point (-0.5, 0):

[(-0.5 + 2)^2]/a² + [0 - k]^2 / b² = 1 → (1.5²)/a² + k² / b² = 1 → (2.25)/a² + k² / b² = 1.

Similarly, for point (-3.5, 0):

[(-3.5 + 2)^2]/a² + [0 - k]^2 / b² = 1 → (-1.5)^2 /a² + k² / b² = 1 → same as before: 2.25/a² + k² / b² = 1. So both equations give the same thing. So that doesn't help directly.

Now, considering the y-intercept (0, 2):

Plug x=0, y=2 into the ellipse equation:

[(0 + 2)^2]/a² + [(2 - k)^2]/b² = 1 → 4/a² + (2 - k)^2 / b² = 1.

So now, we have two equations:

Equation 1: 2.25/a² + k² / b² = 1.

Equation 2: 4/a² + (2 - k)^2 / b² = 1.

Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:

[4/a² - 2.25/a²] + [(2 - k)^2 / b² - k² / b²] = 0 → (1.75)/a² + [ ( (2 - k)^2 - k^2 ) / b² ] = 0.

Compute (2 - k)^2 - k² = 4 -4k +k² -k² = 4 -4k.

Thus:

1.75/a² + (4 - 4k)/b² = 0.

But this introduces another variable, k. How do we find k?

We need more information. Maybe there's something else. Wait, the ellipse passes through the point (0, 2). Also, since the center is at (-2, k), perhaps there's symmetry? Or maybe we can assume that the y-intercept corresponds to the vertex of the ellipse along the y-axis? Wait, but in standard position, the vertices are along the major and minor axes. If the ellipse is not centered at the origin, then the intercepts may not align with the axes.

Alternatively, maybe we can assume that the ellipse is symmetric with respect to the line connecting the x-intercepts and the y-intercept. But I don't see how that helps immediately.

Wait, but we have two variables here: k and the ratio of a² and b². Let me denote m = 1/a² and n = 1/b². Then, Equation 1 becomes 2.25*m + k²*n = 1. Equation 2 becomes 4*m + (2 - k)^2*n = 1. And from the previous subtraction, we had 1.75*m + (4 - 4k)*n = 0.

So three equations with variables m, n, k. But we need more relations. Wait, but maybe there's another condition? Or perhaps we can express m in terms of n and substitute?

From the third equation: 1.75*m = - (4 - 4k)*n → m = [ - (4 - 4k)/1.75 ] * n.

Plugging into Equation 1: 2.25*[ - (4 - 4k)/1.75 ] *n + k² *n = 1.

Factor out n:

n [ 2.25*(-4 + 4k)/1.75 + k² ] = 1.

This seems messy. Let me compute the coefficients numerically.

First, note that 2.25 divided by 1.75 is equal to 2.25 / 1.75 = 9/7 ≈ 1.2857. So:

Coefficient term: 2.25 * (-4 + 4k)/1.75 = (9/7) * (-4 + 4k) ?

Wait, 2.25 is 9/4, and 1.75 is 7/4. So:

2.25 / 1.75 = (9/4) / (7/4) ) = 9/7.

Yes. So:

n [ (9/7)(-4 + 4k) + k² ] = 1.

Let me write that as:

n [ k² + (9/7)(-4 + 4k) ] = 1.

But this still leaves us with two variables, n and k. Unless we can find another relation. Alternatively, maybe we can find k by assuming that the ellipse is symmetric in some way. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe we can consider that the ellipse passes through (0, 2), which is a y-intercept. If the ellipse is not a circle, then the y-intercept might not be aligned with the vertical axis. But without more points, it's hard to determine.

Wait, but maybe there's another intercept? For example, if the ellipse is symmetric about the line joining the x-intercepts and the y-intercept. But that's not necessarily true. Alternatively, maybe there's another intercept on the y-axis? But the problem states only one intercept at 2.

Alternatively, maybe the ellipse has only one y-intercept at 2, implying that it's tangent to the y-axis there. In that case, the derivative at that point would be horizontal, meaning the tangent line is horizontal. Let me explore that possibility.

If the ellipse is tangent to the y-axis at (0, 2), then the slope of the tangent line at that point is zero. To find the slope, take the derivative implicitly.

Starting with the ellipse equation: ((x - h)^2)/a² + ((y - k)^2)/b² = 1.

Differentiating both sides with respect to x:

2(x - h)/a² + 2(y - k)y'/b² = 0 → y' = - [ (x - h)/a² ] * [ b²/(y - k) ]

At the point (0, 2), y'=0. So:

0 = - [ (0 - h)/a² ] * [ b²/(2 - k) ] → which implies either h=0, or denominator is infinite (but that's not possible). Wait, unless the numerator is zero. So (0 - h)/a² = 0 → h=0. But earlier we found that the x-intercepts are at -0.5 and -3.5, whose midpoint is -2, so h=-2. Contradiction. So this suggests that the ellipse is not tangent to the y-axis at (0,2). Therefore, my assumption that it's tangent is wrong. Hence, there must be another y-intercept, but the problem statement only mentions one. This seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe the problem statement is ambiguous. It says "intersects with y-axis at 2"—does that mean the y-intercept is at y=2, i.e., the point (0,2)? Yes, that's likely. So there's only one y-intercept at (0,2), which would imply that the ellipse crosses the y-axis at that point. So it's not tangent, but passes through (0,2). Therefore, there's another point on the y-axis? Or maybe the other intercept is at (0, something else)? But the problem states only one intercept. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the ellipse has only one y-intercept due to its orientation. For example, if the ellipse is very elongated vertically, it might cross the y-axis once. But usually, an ellipse centered at (h,k) would cross the y-axis twice unless it's tangent. But if it's tangent, then it would touch at one point. But earlier calculation suggested that the slope at (0,2) would require h=0, which conflicts with our previous conclusion that h=-2. So this seems contradictory.

Maybe there's a mistake in assuming the center is at (-2, k)? Let me re-examine that. Earlier, I assumed that the x-intercepts are symmetric around the center's x-coordinate. Is that always true for an ellipse aligned with the axes? Yes, because the ellipse is symmetric about its center. So if the ellipse crosses the x-axis at two points, those points are symmetric about the center's x-coordinate. Hence, the midpoint between -0.5 and -3.5 is indeed -2, so the x-coordinate of the center is -2. Therefore, h = -2. So that part is correct.

So with h=-2, we have the center at (-2, k). Now, the y-intercept is at (0,2). So plugging into the ellipse equation:

[(0 + 2)^2]/a² + [(2 - k)^2]/b² = 1 → 4/a² + (2 - k)^2 / b² = 1.

And from the x-intercepts, we have:

[(1.5)^2]/a² + [k^2]/b² = 1 → 2.25/a² + k² / b² = 1.

Let me call these Equations (1) and (2):

Equation (1): 2.25/a² + k² / b² = 1.

Equation (2): 4/a² + (2 - k)^2 / b² = 1.

Let me subtract Equation (1) from Equation (2):

[4/a² - 2.25/a²] + [(2 - k)^2 / b² - k² / b²] = 0 → 1.75/a² + [(2 - k)^2 - k²]/b² = 0.

As before, expanding (2 - k)^2 - k² = 4 - 4k.

So:

1.75/a² + (4 - 4k)/b² = 0.

Let me call this Equation (3).

Now, we have two equations involving a², b², and k. Let me denote u = 1/a² and v = 1/b². Then:

Equation (1): 2.25u + k²v = 1.

Equation (3): 1.75u + (4 - 4k)v = 0.

Now, we can solve for u and v in terms of k.

From Equation (3): 1.75u = -(4 - 4k)v → u = [-(4 - 4k)/1.75] * v.

Plugging into Equation (1):

2.25 * [-(4 - 4k)/1.75] * v + k²v = 1.

Factor out v:

v [ 2.25 * -(4 - 4k)/1.75 + k² ] = 1.

Let me compute the coefficient:

2.25 / 1.75 = 9/7 ≈ 1.2857.

So:

v [ -9/7*(4 - 4k) + k² ] = 1.

Expanding -9/7*(4 - 4k) = -9/7*4 + 9/7*4k = -36/7 + 36k/7.

Thus:

v [ k² + 36k/7 - 36/7 ] = 1.

So:

v [ k² + (36k - 36)/7 ] = 1.

Now, this is one equation with variables v and k. But we need another relation to connect v and k. Wait, but we have another equation from the previous substitution. Wait, but we already used both equations. So this seems like a dead end. 

Unless there's another condition. What if we assume that the ellipse is also symmetric in some other way? For instance, if the ellipse has its major axis along the x-axis or y-axis. Let's suppose that the major axis is along the x-axis, so a > b. Or vice versa. But without knowing whether it's major or minor axis, this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe there's a unique solution for k? Let me try to find k. Let's assume that the ellipse has its major axis along the x-axis. Then, the distance between the x-intercepts would be 2a. Wait, but earlier, we said that the distance between the x-intercepts is 3, which would mean 2a = 3 → a = 1.5. But this assumes that the x-intercepts are the endpoints of the major axis. But if the ellipse is not centered at the origin, this may not hold. Wait, the standard form of an ellipse is ((x-h)^2)/a² + ((y-k)^2)/b² = 1, where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes. The x-intercepts of the ellipse (when y=0) are at x = h ± a. Wait, no! Only if the ellipse is aligned with the axes and the major axis is along the x-axis. In that case, the x-intercepts would be at (h ± a, 0). But in our case, the center is at (-2, k), so the x-intercepts would be at x = -2 ± a. So the x-intercepts are -2 + a and -2 - a. Given that these are -0.5 and -3.5, let's set up equations:

-2 + a = -0.5 → a = 1.5

Or -2 - a = -0.5 → a = -1.5, but since a is positive, discard negative.

So a = 1.5. Then, the x-intercepts are at -2 + 1.5 = -0.5 and -2 - 1.5 = -3.5. Perfect! That matches the given x-intercepts. So this suggests that the major axis is along the x-axis, with a = 1.5, and center at (-2, k). 

Now, with a = 1.5, we can proceed. So a² = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. 

Now, we can revisit Equation (1): 2.25/a² + k² / b² = 1. But since a² is 2.25, this becomes 2.25 / 2.25 + k² / b² = 1 → 1 + k² / b² = 1 → k² / b² = 0 → k = 0. 

Wait, this suggests that k = 0. So the center is at (-2, 0). 

But then, let's check this. If the center is at (-2, 0), then the equation of the ellipse is ((x + 2)^2)/2.25 + y² / b² = 1. Now, we need to find b. Using the y-intercept (0, 2):

Plug x=0, y=2 into the equation:

(0 + 2)^2 / 2.25 + (2)^2 / b² = 1 → 4 / 2.25 + 4 / b² = 1.

Calculate 4 / 2.25: 4 divided by 2.25 is approximately 1.777..., or exactly 16/9.

So:

16/9 + 4/b² = 1 → 4/b² = 1 - 16/9 = -7/9.

Wait, this leads to 4/b² = -7/9, which is impossible since b² is positive. So this contradiction suggests an error in assumptions.

Ah! Here's the mistake. If we assumed that the major axis is along the x-axis, then the x-intercepts are at h ± a. But in our case, the center is at (-2, k). So the x-intercepts are at x = -2 ± a. Given that these are -0.5 and -3.5, which are symmetric around -2. Indeed, -2 + a = -0.5 → a = 1.5, and -2 - a = -3.5 → same a. So this is correct. But then, plugging into the y-intercept gives an inconsistency. Why?

Because if the major axis is along the x-axis, then the minor axis is along the y-axis. So the y-intercepts (if any) would be at y = ±b. But in this case, the ellipse has a y-intercept at (0, 2). So plugging x=0, y=2 into the equation gives:

[(0 + 2)^2]/a² + (2 - k)^2 / b² = 1. Wait, no. Wait, the general equation is ((x - h)^2)/a² + ((y - k)^2)/b² = 1. If the center is at (-2, 0), then k=0. So the equation becomes ((x + 2)^2)/a² + y² / b² = 1. Plugging in (0, 2):

((0 + 2)^2)/a² + (2)^2 / b² = 1 → 4/a² + 4/b² = 1.

But since a = 1.5, a² = 2.25, so 4/2.25 = 16/9 ≈ 1.777..., so:

16/9 + 4/b² = 1 → 4/b² = 1 - 16/9 = -7/9. Still impossible. So this suggests that the assumption that the major axis is along the x-axis is incorrect. 

Wait, but why? Because if the major axis is along the x-axis, then the y-intercepts would be at y = ±b. But here, the ellipse passes through (0, 2), which would mean that b = 2. Let me check that. If the center is at (-2, 0), and the major axis is along x-axis with a=1.5, then the minor axis is along y-axis with b. So the y-intercepts would be at y = ±b. If the ellipse passes through (0, 2), then 2 must be equal to b. So b=2. Then, plugging into the equation:

4/a² + 4/b² = 1 → 4/2.25 + 4/4 = 1 → 4/2.25 + 1 = 1 → 4/2.25 = 0 → which is false. So contradiction.

So what went wrong? It appears that assuming the major axis is along the x-axis leads to inconsistency. So perhaps the major axis is along the y-axis? Let's try that. If the major axis is along the y-axis, then the equation would be ((x - h)^2)/b² + ((y - k)^2)/a² = 1, where a > b. In this case, the y-intercepts would be at y = k ± a. But we have a y-intercept at (0, 2). Let's assume that the major axis is along the y-axis, so the y-intercepts are at y = k ± a. If one of these is 2, then we have k + a = 2 or k - a = 2. But we don't know which. However, since the ellipse also has x-intercepts at -0.5 and -3.5, which are symmetric around the center's x-coordinate h = -2. So again, h = -2. 

In this scenario, the x-intercepts are at x = -2 ± b, since the major axis is along the y-axis. So the x-intercepts are at x = -2 ± b. These are given as -0.5 and -3.5. So:

-2 + b = -0.5 → b = 1.5, and -2 - b = -3.5 → same b=1.5. So b = 1.5. 

Now, the equation is ((x + 2)^2)/(1.5)^2 + ((y - k)^2)/a² = 1.

Now, the y-intercept is at (0, 2). Plugging x=0, y=2:

((0 + 2)^2)/(2.25) + ((2 - k)^2)/a² = 1 → 4/2.25 + ((2 - k)^2)/a² = 1.

Which simplifies to 16/9 + ((2 - k)^2)/a² = 1 → ((2 - k)^2)/a² = 1 - 16/9 = -7/9. Again, impossible since squares are non-negative. So same contradiction. 

Hmm, so assuming either major axis along x or y leads to contradiction. This suggests that the ellipse is not aligned with the coordinate axes, or there's another issue. 

Wait, but the initial assumption that the x-intercepts are symmetric around the center's x-coordinate is valid regardless of the ellipse's orientation. But maybe the ellipse is rotated? The problem didn't mention rotation, so I assumed it was axis-aligned. But if it's rotated, the equation becomes more complex, involving rotation terms. However, the problem gave intercepts on the axes, which might suggest that it's axis-aligned. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the previous steps. Let me double-check.

Assuming the ellipse is axis-aligned, with center at (-2, k), and major/minor axes along x and y. 

Case 1: Major axis along x. Then, x-intercepts are at h ± a. So a = 1.5, as before. Then, the y-intercepts are at k ± b. But the ellipse passes through (0, 2), which is one of the y-intercepts. So either k + b = 2 or k - b = 2. Let's say k + b = 2. Then, we can write k = 2 - b. 

Now, the equation of the ellipse is ((x + 2)^2)/a² + ((y - k)^2)/b² = 1. Plugging in the y-intercept (0, 2):

((0 + 2)^2)/a² + ((2 - k)^2)/b² = 1 → 4/a² + (b)^2 / b² = 1 → 4/a² + 1 = 1 → 4/a² = 0 → a² approaches infinity, which is impossible. Contradiction. 

Alternatively, if k - b = 2 → k = b + 2. Plugging into the equation:

((0 + 2)^2)/a² + ((2 - k)^2)/b² = 1 → 4/a² + ((-b)^2)/b² = 1 → 4/a² + 1 = 1 → same contradiction. 

So this suggests that if the ellipse is axis-aligned, there's no solution. But the problem states that such an ellipse exists. So what's wrong here?

Wait, maybe the ellipse is not axis-aligned, and hence requires a rotated equation. But deriving that is more complex. Let me think. The general equation of a conic section is Ax² + Bxy + Cy² + Dx + Ey + F = 0. Given that it's an ellipse, certain conditions on A, B, C, etc., must hold. But this approach might be too involved.

However, the problem provides specific intercepts. Let me think differently. The ellipse passes through (-0.5, 0), (-3.5, 0), and (0, 2). Let me use these three points to determine the equation.

Assume the general equation of an ellipse: Ax² + By² + Cx + Dy + E = 0. Wait, but this is for a conic section. For an ellipse, it should satisfy certain conditions. But with three points, it's underdetermined. Need more conditions.

Alternatively, since it's an ellipse, we can use the general form with center (h, k), major/minor axes, etc. But earlier attempts led to contradictions. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the x-intercepts are symmetric around the center. Let me recheck.

The x-intercepts are at (-0.5, 0) and (-3.5, 0). The midpoint between these two points is (-2, 0). So the center must lie somewhere on the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining these two points. Since the segment is horizontal (both points have y=0), the perpendicular bisector is the vertical line through (-2, 0). So the center has x-coordinate -2, and y-coordinate k. So center at (-2, k). This part is correct.

So the equation is ((x + 2)^2)/a² + ((y - k)^2)/b² = 1. 

Now, we have three points: (-0.5, 0), (-3.5, 0), and (0, 2). Let's plug them into the equation.

First, for (-0.5, 0):

[(−0.5 + 2)^2]/a² + [(0 − k)^2]/b² = 1 → (1.5)^2 / a² + k² / b² = 1 → 2.25/a² + k²/b² = 1. (Equation 1)

Second, for (-3.5, 0):

Same as first point: 2.25/a² + k²/b² = 1. Same as Equation 1.

Third, for (0, 2):

[(0 + 2)^2]/a² + [(2 − k)^2]/b² = 1 → 4/a² + (2 − k)^2 / b² = 1. (Equation 2)

Now, we have two equations:

Equation 1: 2.25/a² + k²/b² = 1.

Equation 2: 4/a² + (2 - k)^2 / b² = 1.

Let me call these equations (1) and (2). Let me subtract (1) from (2):

[4/a² - 2.25/a²] + [(2 - k)^2 / b² - k² / b²] = 0 → 1.75/a² + [ (4 - 4k) / b² ] = 0.

Let me rewrite this as:

1.75/a² = - (4 - 4k)/b² → 1.75/a² = (4k - 4)/b².

Let me call this Equation (3).

Now, from Equation (1): 2.25/a² = 1 - k²/b².

Let me call this Equation (1').

Let me denote u = 1/a² and v = 1/b². Then, Equation (1') becomes 2.25u = 1 - k²v. Equation (3) becomes 1.75u = (4k - 4)v.

Now, from Equation (3): u = (4k - 4)v / 1.75.

Plugging into Equation (1'):

2.25 * (4k - 4)v / 1.75 = 1 - k²v.

Multiply both sides by 1.75 to eliminate denominator:

2.25 * (4k - 4)v = 1.75 - 1.75k²v.

Let me rearrange:

2.25*(4k - 4)v + 1.75k²v = 1.75.

Factor out v:

v [2.25*(4k - 4) + 1.75k²] = 1.75.

Now, let's compute the coefficient inside the brackets:

First, expand 2.25*(4k - 4) = 9k - 9 (since 2.25*4 = 9, and 2.25*(-4) = -9).

So:

9k - 9 + 1.75k² = 1.75k² + 9k - 9.

Thus:

v (1.75k² + 9k - 9) = 1.75.

Now, this is one equation with two variables, v and k. But we need another relationship. However, we have only used the three points. Maybe there's another condition? Or perhaps we can choose k such that this equation holds? Let me think. 

Since we have one equation with two variables, it's underdetermined. But perhaps we can choose k such that the coefficient of v is non-zero, and then solve for v. Let me try to express v in terms of k:

v = 1.75 / (1.75k² + 9k - 9).

But we also know from Equation (1'): 2.25u = 1 - k²v, and u = (4k - 4)v / 1.75.

Wait, from Equation (3), u = (4k - 4)v / 1.75. Substituting into Equation (1'):

2.25 * [(4k - 4)v / 1.75] = 1 - k²v.

Let me multiply through:

(2.25 / 1.75)(4k - 4)v = 1 - k²v.

Calculate 2.25 / 1.75 = 9/7.

So:

(9/7)(4k - 4)v = 1 - k²v.

Rearranging:

(9/7)(4k - 4)v + k²v = 1.

Factor out v:

v [ (9/7)(4k - 4) + k² ] = 1.

This is the same equation as before, leading to v = 1 / [ (9/7)(4k - 4) + k² ].

But this still leaves us with one equation for k. To solve for k, we need additional constraints. Perhaps there's another condition from the fact that the ellipse is defined, requiring that the discriminant is positive, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps we can assume that the ellipse is symmetric in some way. For example, if the center is at (-2, k), and the y-intercept is at (0, 2), maybe there's a relationship between k and the other parameters. Let me try to guess a value for k that makes the equation solvable.

Let me try k = 1. Then:

v = 1 / [ (9/7)(4*1 - 4) + (1)^2 ] = 1 / [ (9/7)(0) + 1 ] = 1/1 = 1.

So v = 1. Then, from Equation (3): u = (4*1 - 4)v / 1.75 = 0 / 1.75 = 0. But u = 1/a² = 0 → a² → ∞, which is invalid. So no good.

Try k = 2: 

v = 1 / [ (9/7)(4*2 - 4) + (2)^2 ] = 1 / [ (9/7)(4) + 4 ] = 1 / [ 36/7 + 28/7 ] = 1 / (64/7) = 7/64.

Then, u = (4*2 - 4)*v /
