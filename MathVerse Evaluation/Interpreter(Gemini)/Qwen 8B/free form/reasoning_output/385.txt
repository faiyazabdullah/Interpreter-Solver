MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a right-angled triangle where one of the acute angles is 30 degrees, and one of the legs has a length of √10. We need to find the length of another side, denoted by x. 

First, I need to recall some properties of right-angled triangles, especially those with a 30-degree angle. From what I remember, in a right-angled triangle, if one of the angles is 30 degrees, the sides have a specific ratio. Specifically, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, and 90° are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Wait, so the side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest one, then the other leg is √3 times longer, and the hypotenuse is twice the shortest side. But I need to make sure which side corresponds to which here.

The problem mentions that there's a right angle, and one of the acute angles is 30 degrees. Let me try to visualize the triangle. Let's denote the triangle as T1-T2-T3, with a right angle at T2? Or maybe at T3? Wait, the predicates mention RightAngle(Angle(T1,T3,T2)), which would mean the angle at T3 is the right angle. Because the Angle predicate is written as Angle(A,B,C), which typically denotes the angle at point B between points A and C. Wait, no—wait, in standard notation, Angle(A,B,C) is the angle at vertex B formed by points A, B, C. So, if it's RightAngle(Angle(T1,T3,T2)), that means the angle at T3 between points T1, T3, T2. Therefore, the right angle is at T3. So the triangle has vertices T1, T2, T3, with the right angle at T3. That makes sense.

So, the triangle has a right angle at T3, and one of the acute angles is 30 degrees. Which angle is 30 degrees? The MeasureOf(Angle(T3,T2,T1),30). Wait, Angle(T3,T2,T1) would be the angle at T2 between points T3, T2, T1. So that angle at T2 is 30 degrees. Therefore, the triangle has a right angle at T3, a 30-degree angle at T2, and thus the third angle at T1 must be 60 degrees because the angles in a triangle add up to 180. So angles are 90° at T3, 30° at T2, and 60° at T1.

Now, the sides of the triangle: the sides are Line(T1,T2), Line(T2,T3), and Line(T1,T3). Given that IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2), Triangle(...)), so the line T1-T2 is the hypotenuse. Wait, but in a right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at T3, the hypotenuse should be the side opposite T3, which is the line connecting T1 and T2. Therefore, Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse. Then the other two sides, Line(T2,T3) and Line(T1,T3), are the legs.

But the problem says "one leg measuring √10". Which leg? The LengthOf(Line(T2,T3), x) — wait, the question asks us to solve for x, which is the length of Line(T2,T3). So, Line(T2,T3) is one leg, and Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse. Wait, but hold on: If the right angle is at T3, then the legs are T3T2 and T3T1. Wait, maybe I got confused earlier. Let me clarify:

If the right angle is at T3, then the two legs are T3T2 and T3T1, and the hypotenuse is T1T2. Therefore, the legs are the ones connected to T3. However, the given LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)) — so the hypotenuse is sqrt(10)? Wait, no. Wait, the predicate says IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2), Triangle(T1,T2,T3)). So yes, Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the hypotenuse is between T1 and T2, and the legs are T1-T3 and T2-T3. Therefore, the two legs are T1T3 and T2T3. The problem states that one leg measures sqrt(10). Which leg is that?

Wait, the problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". The question is to solve for x, which is the length of Line(T2,T3). So Line(T2,T3) is a leg. Therefore, either Line(T2,T3) or Line(T1,T3) is the leg with measure sqrt(10). Wait, but the problem doesn't specify which one. However, since the angle at T2 is 30 degrees, perhaps we can figure out which leg corresponds to which.

Let me think again about the angles. In triangle T1-T2-T3, right-angled at T3. So the angles are:

At T3: 90°, at T2: 30°, so at T1: 60°. Now, in such a triangle, the side opposite the 30° angle is the shorter leg. Which side is opposite the 30° angle? The angle at T2 is 30°, so the side opposite to T2 is T1T3. Wait, because in triangle ABC, the side opposite angle A is BC. So in our case, angle at T2 is 30°, so the side opposite is T1T3. Therefore, the side opposite 30° is T1T3. Thus, that side is the shorter leg. The other leg is T2T3, which is adjacent to the 30° angle at T2. And the hypotenuse is T1T2.

Given that, the hypotenuse is T1T2, which has length sqrt(10) according to the predicate? Wait, no. Wait, the predicate says LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)). So the hypotenuse, which is T1T2, has length sqrt(10). But wait, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. So if the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), then the shorter leg (opposite 30°) is half of that, which would be sqrt(10)/2. However, the problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)", so maybe the given leg is not the shorter one but the longer one?

Wait, confusion arises here. Let me re-express:

We have a right-angled triangle with angles 30°, 60°, 90°. Let's denote:

- Hypotenuse (longest side): opposite the right angle, which is T1T2 in this case. Its length is given as sqrt(10).

- The side opposite the 30° angle (at T2) is T1T3. This is the shorter leg.

- The side opposite the 60° angle (at T1) is T2T3. This is the longer leg.

Therefore, in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where 1 is the shorter leg (opposite 30°), √3 is the longer leg (opposite 60°), and 2 is the hypotenuse.

Given that the hypotenuse here is sqrt(10), so 2x = sqrt(10) => x = sqrt(10)/2. Here, x would be the shorter leg. But the problem states that "one leg measuring sqrt(10)"—so if the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), then that contradicts because the hypotenuse is longer than each leg. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.

Wait, hold on! There's a contradiction here. Let me check again. The problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)." So the hypotenuse cannot be sqrt(10); instead, one of the legs is sqrt(10). But according to the given predicate, LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)) — so Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse and its length is sqrt(10). But that would imply that the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), so the legs must be shorter. However, the problem also says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)", which suggests that one of the legs is sqrt(10). But that would conflict with the hypotenuse being sqrt(10), unless the hypotenuse is not the one mentioned. Wait, maybe I misread the predicate.

Wait, looking back: The predicates include:

IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2),Triangle(T1,T2,T3)) — so Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the hypotenuse is T1T2, and its length is given as sqrt(10). But the problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". So, that implies that one of the legs (either T1T3 or T2T3) is sqrt(10). Therefore, the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), and one of the legs is sqrt(10). That would be impossible because in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is always longer than each leg. Hence, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying which side is the hypotenuse. Let me recheck the predicates. The RightAngle(Angle(T1,T3,T2)) indicates the right angle is at T3. So the triangle has vertices T1, T2, T3 with right angle at T3. Therefore, the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, which would be the side connecting T1 and T2. Therefore, Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse, and its length is given as sqrt(10). However, the problem states "one leg measuring sqrt(10)", which would be one of the other sides. So, if the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), then the legs must be shorter. But how does that fit with the angle measures?

Alternatively, perhaps the given leg is the longer leg. Let me consider the ratios again. Suppose that the leg opposite the 30° angle is the shorter leg, and the other leg is longer. Let me assign variables.

Let’s denote:

Let’s call the shorter leg (opposite 30°) as 'a', the longer leg (opposite 60°) as 'b', and hypotenuse as 'c'.

In a 30-60-90 triangle, c = 2a, and b = a√3.

Given that one of the legs is sqrt(10), and the hypotenuse is sqrt(10). Wait, but if the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), then the legs would be sqrt(10)/2 and (sqrt(10)/2)*sqrt(3). But the problem says one leg is sqrt(10). Therefore, that scenario isn't possible. Hence, there's a contradiction. Therefore, my initial assumption must be incorrect.

Wait, maybe the hypotenuse isn't the one given as sqrt(10). Let me check the predicates again. The given LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)) — so Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse with length sqrt(10). But if that's the case, then the legs cannot be longer than that. However, the problem states that "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". Wait, that would mean that one of the legs is sqrt(10), which would require the hypotenuse to be longer than sqrt(10). But according to the given, the hypotenuse is sqrt(10). Therefore, there's inconsistency. 

This suggests that there might be an error in interpreting which side is which. Let me go back to the problem statement.

The problem says: "In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 30°, one leg measuring √10." So, the triangle has a right angle, one acute angle is 30°, and one of the legs is √10. The question is to find the length of x, which is the length of Line(T2,T3). 

From the predicates, we know that the right angle is at T3. So, the triangle has vertices T1, T2, T3 with right angle at T3. Therefore, the legs are T1T3 and T2T3, and the hypotenuse is T1T2. The given length is of Line(T1,T2) as sqrt(10). Wait, but if that's the hypotenuse, and one of the legs is sqrt(10), then that would imply that the hypotenuse is shorter than one of the legs, which is impossible. Therefore, something is wrong here.

Wait, unless the given LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)) refers to a different side. Let me check the predicates again. The IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2), Triangle(...)) — so Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse. Therefore, the hypotenuse is T1T2, with length sqrt(10). But if one of the legs is sqrt(10), then that leg must be longer than the hypotenuse, which is impossible. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Unless the given leg is not the one we're supposed to find. Let me re-examine the problem.

The problem says: "one leg measuring √10". The question is to solve for x, which is the length of Line(T2,T3). So, perhaps the given leg is the other leg, not the one we're solving for. Wait, but if the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), then the legs are shorter. So, if one of the legs is sqrt(10), then the hypotenuse would have to be longer than sqrt(10), but according to the given, the hypotenuse is sqrt(10). Therefore, this seems impossible. 

Wait, maybe I've misassigned which side is the hypotenuse. Perhaps the hypotenuse is not T1T2? Let me check again. The right angle is at T3, so the hypotenuse should be the side opposite the right angle, which is T1T2. So, that's correct. 

Wait, could the given LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)) refer to a different segment? No, the predicate explicitly says LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)). So, Line(T1,T2) is indeed the hypotenuse with length sqrt(10). Therefore, this suggests that the problem may have conflicting information, but likely I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the leg that measures sqrt(10) is the one adjacent to the 30° angle. Let me think again about the triangle's structure. Let me draw it mentally: right angle at T3, angle at T2 is 30°, so the triangle has angles 90°, 30°, 60°. The side opposite the 30° angle is the shorter leg, which is T1T3. The side opposite the 60° angle is the longer leg, T2T3. The hypotenuse is T1T2.

If one of the legs measures sqrt(10), then either T1T3 or T2T3 is sqrt(10). Let's assume that the given leg is T2T3 (the longer leg), which is x. Wait, but the problem says to solve for x, which is the length of Line(T2,T3). So, if T2T3 is the longer leg, then we can relate it to the hypotenuse. 

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Let me define:

Shorter leg (opposite 30°): T1T3 = a  
Longer leg (opposite 60°): T2T3 = b  
Hypotenuse: T1T2 = c  

Relationships:  
b = a√3  
c = 2a  

But we are told that the hypotenuse c is sqrt(10). Therefore:

c = 2a = sqrt(10) ⇒ a = sqrt(10)/2  
Then, b = a√3 = (sqrt(10)/2) * √3 = (sqrt(30))/2 ≈ ... 

However, the problem states that "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". If the given leg is the longer leg (b), then b = sqrt(10). Let's see:

If b = sqrt(10), then from b = a√3, we get a = sqrt(10)/√3 = sqrt(10/3). Then, the hypotenuse c = 2a = 2*sqrt(10/3) = 2*sqrt(10)/sqrt(3) = 2*sqrt(30)/3. But the problem says the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), which would not match. Hence, this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, suppose that the given leg is the shorter leg a = sqrt(10). Then, the hypotenuse c = 2a = 2*sqrt(10), which contradicts the given hypotenuse length of sqrt(10). 

Thus, there's a contradiction here. How is this possible? Maybe I made a wrong assumption about which angle is which. Let me double-check the angle measures.

The problem says that the MeasureOf(Angle(T3,T2,T1),30). As per the Angle(A,B,C) notation, this is the angle at point B (T2) between points T3, T2, T1. So that's the angle at T2, which is 30°. Therefore, the triangle has angles:

- At T3: 90°  
- At T2: 30°  
- At T1: 60°  

So, the side opposite the 30° angle (at T2) is T1T3. The side opposite the 60° angle (at T1) is T2T3. The hypotenuse is T1T2. 

Given that, if one of the legs is sqrt(10), which one? If the problem states that one leg measures sqrt(10), and we need to find x, which is the length of T2T3. Let's suppose that the given leg is the shorter leg, which is T1T3, and the other leg is T2T3 (which is x). But the problem says that one leg measures sqrt(10), but which one? 

Wait, the problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". It doesn't specify which one. So, perhaps the given leg is the longer leg (T2T3), and we need to find its length, but then the hypotenuse is given as sqrt(10). But as before, this leads to inconsistency.

Wait, unless the hypotenuse is not sqrt(10), but the given leg is sqrt(10). Wait, the problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)", and the hypotenuse is given as sqrt(10)? That can't be. So, there must be a miscalculation here.

Wait, going back to the original problem: 

The user wrote: "LengthOf(Line(T1,T2),SqrtOf(10))" — this means the length of Line(T1,T2) is sqrt(10). But Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse. So hypotenuse is sqrt(10). One leg measures sqrt(10). This is impossible because the hypotenuse must be longer than each leg. Hence, there's an inconsistency. 

Wait, unless the given leg is the hypotenuse? No, the hypotenuse is Line(T1,T2), which is given as sqrt(10). So, this suggests that there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the predicates. Let me re-examine them carefully.

The given predicates include:

- RightAngle(Angle(T1,T3,T2)): right angle at T3  
- MeasureOf(Angle(T3,T2,T1),30): angle at T2 is 30°  
- LengthOf(Line(T2,T3),x): x is the length of Line(T2,T3)  
- LengthOf(Line(T1,T2),SqrtOf(10)): hypotenuse length is sqrt(10)  
- IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2),Triangle(...)): confirms hypotenuse is T1T2  
- IsSideOf(Line(T2,T3),Triangle(...)): confirms Line(T2,T3) is a side  
- IsSideOf(Line(T1,T3),Triangle(...)): confirms Line(T1,T3) is a side  
- Right(Triangle(...)): confirms it's a right triangle  

So, the problem states that in this right-angled triangle, one acute angle is 30°, and one leg measures sqrt(10). The question is to find x, which is the length of Line(T2,T3). 

But according to the given data, the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), and one leg is sqrt(10). This is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding. Let me try to approach it differently.

Maybe the given leg is not part of the 30-60-90 triangle? Wait, no, since it's a right-angled triangle with a 30° angle, it must be a 30-60-90 triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the given leg is the hypotenuse? No, the hypotenuse is specified as Line(T1,T2) with length sqrt(10). 

Wait, unless the given leg is the hypotenuse? No, the hypotenuse is defined as the side opposite the right angle, which is Line(T1,T2). 

This seems like a contradiction. However, maybe the problem is not a 30-60-90 triangle? No, because one of the angles is 30°, making it a 30-60-90 triangle. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 30° angle is at T1 instead of T2? Let me check. The MeasureOf(Angle(T3,T2,T1),30) is the angle at T2, which is 30°. So, the angle at T2 is 30°, making the triangle have angles 90° at T3, 30° at T2, and 60° at T1. 

Therefore, the sides are:

- Opposite 30° (angle at T2): T1T3 (shorter leg)  
- Opposite 60° (angle at T1): T2T3 (longer leg)  
- Hypotenuse: T1T2  

So, if one of the legs is sqrt(10), it could be either T1T3 or T2T3. Let's say the given leg is T2T3 (the longer leg), which is x. Then, we can use trigonometry to relate the sides.

In a right triangle, the tangent of an angle is opposite over adjacent. For the 30° angle at T2, the opposite side is T1T3, and the adjacent side is T2T3. So tan(30°) = opposite / adjacent = (T1T3)/(T2T3). 

Let me denote:

Let’s call T1T3 = a (opposite 30°), T2T3 = b (adjacent to 30°), hypotenuse c = T1T2 = sqrt(10). 

tan(30°) = a/b → 1/√3 = a/b → a = b/√3.

Also, by Pythagoras: a² + b² = c² → (b²)/3 + b² = 10 → (4b²)/3 = 10 → b² = (10 * 3)/4 = 30/4 = 15/2 → b = sqrt(15/2) = (√30)/2 ≈ 2.738...

But the problem states that one leg measures sqrt(10). If the given leg is b (T2T3), then b = sqrt(10). Let's check if that fits. If b = sqrt(10), then from a = b/√3, a = sqrt(10)/√3 = sqrt(10/3). Then, the hypotenuse c = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt( (10/3) + 10 ) = sqrt( (10/3) + 30/3 ) = sqrt(40/3) = (2√30)/3 ≈ 3.65... But the given hypotenuse is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.16..., which does not match. Hence, inconsistency.

Alternatively, if the given leg is a (T1T3) = sqrt(10), then a = sqrt(10). From a = b/√3, we get b = a√3 = sqrt(10)*√3 = sqrt(30). Then the hypotenuse c = sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt(10 + 30) = sqrt(40) = 2√10 ≈ 6.324. But the given hypotenuse is sqrt(10), which again does not match. 

This suggests that there's a contradiction in the problem's given data. However, since the problem is presented as solvable, I must have made a mistake in my assumptions. Let me try a different approach. 

Perhaps the given length of sqrt(10) is not a leg but the hypotenuse? But the problem states that "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". Wait, but the given LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)) is the hypotenuse. So, the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), and one leg is sqrt(10). This is impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a typo in the problem, or I'm misinterpreting the predicates. 

Wait, let me read the original problem again: 

"GIVEN GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
Triangle(T1,T2,T3)
RightAngle(Angle(T1,T3,T2))
MeasureOf(Angle(T3,T2,T1),30)
LengthOf(Line(T2,T3),x)
LengthOf(Line(T1,T2),SqrtOf(10))
IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2),Triangle(T1,T2,T3))
IsSideOf(Line(T2,T3),Triangle(T1,T2,T3))
IsSideOf(Line(T1,T3),Triangle(T1,T2,T3))
Right(Triangle(T1,T2,T3))"

So, the LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)) is the hypotenuse, which is T1T2. The problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". So, one of the legs (T1T3 or T2T3) is sqrt(10). Let's suppose that the given leg is T2T3, which is x. Then, using the 30-60-90 ratios, we can write:

In a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2, where 1 is the shorter leg, √3 is the longer leg, and 2 is the hypotenuse. 

But in this case, the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), so if the longer leg is x, then:

hypotenuse = 2*(shorter leg)  
longer leg = shorter leg * √3

Let’s denote shorter leg as a, longer leg as b, hypotenuse as c.

If the given leg is the longer leg (b = x), then:

c = 2a  
b = a√3  
And we know c = sqrt(10). So:

From b = a√3, we have a = b / √3. Substituting into c = 2a:

c = 2*(b / √3) = 2b / √3 = sqrt(10)

Solving for b:

2b / √3 = sqrt(10)  
=> b = (sqrt(10) * √3) / 2 = sqrt(30)/2

Thus, x = sqrt(30)/2. 

But the problem states that "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". If the given leg is the longer leg, then x = sqrt(30)/2, which is approximately 2.738, while sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162. This doesn't match. Hence, this suggests that the given leg is not the longer leg but the shorter leg. Let's try that.

Assume the given leg is the shorter leg, a = sqrt(10). Then, the hypotenuse c = 2a = 2*sqrt(10). But the given hypotenuse is sqrt(10), which contradicts. 

Alternatively, if the given leg is the hypotenuse, but the problem says it's a leg. 

Wait, this is very confusing. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the labeling of the triangle. Let me try to assign the sides based on the given information.

Since the right angle is at T3, and the angle at T2 is 30°, the sides are:

- Opposite 30° (at T2): T1T3 (shorter leg)  
- Adjacent to 30° (at T2): T2T3 (longer leg)  
- Hypotenuse: T1T2  

Now, the problem says one leg measures sqrt(10). If this leg is T2T3 (longer leg), then we can use the relationship between the longer leg and the hypotenuse. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the longer leg is hypotenuse * cos(30°). Wait, let me recall:

cos(30°) = adjacent / hypotenuse = (longer leg) / hypotenuse. Wait, no. The angle at T2 is 30°, so the adjacent side to this angle is T2T3 (longer leg), and the hypotenuse is T1T2. So, cos(30°) = adjacent/hypotenuse = (T2T3)/T1T2. 

Given that, if T1T2 (hypotenuse) is sqrt(10), then:

cos(30°) = x / sqrt(10)  
=> x = sqrt(10) * cos(30°)  
cos(30°) is √3/2, so x = sqrt(10) * √3/2 = sqrt(30)/2. 

So, x = sqrt(30)/2. 

But the problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". If the given leg is T2T3, then x = sqrt(30)/2 ≈ 2.738, which is not sqrt(10). Hence, this suggests that the given leg is not T2T3 but T1T3 (the shorter leg). Let's check that.

If the shorter leg (T1T3) is sqrt(10), then using sin(30°) = opposite/hypotenuse = (shorter leg)/hypotenuse. 

sin(30°) = 1/2 = sqrt(10)/sqrt(10) = 1, which is not true. Wait, that can't be. 

Wait, if the shorter leg is sqrt(10), then:

sin(30°) = opposite/hypotenuse = (shorter leg)/hypotenuse = sqrt(10)/c. 

But sin(30°) = 1/2, so:

sqrt(10)/c = 1/2 => c = 2*sqrt(10). But the given hypotenuse is sqrt(10), which contradicts. 

This suggests that the given leg cannot be the shorter leg either. 

Hmm, this is perplexing. Perhaps the problem contains a mistake, or I'm missing something. Let me revisit the problem's wording: 

"In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 30°, one leg measuring √10."

It says "one leg measuring √10", not specifying which one. The question is to find x, which is the length of Line(T2,T3). 

Given that, and knowing that the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), let's assume that the given leg is the other leg, and calculate accordingly. 

Let me use the Pythagorean theorem. Let's call the legs a and b, and hypotenuse c = sqrt(10). One of the legs is sqrt(10). Let's say a = sqrt(10). Then, b = sqrt(c² - a²) = sqrt(10 - 10) = 0, which is impossible. 

Alternatively, if the given leg is b = sqrt(10), then a = sqrt(c² - b²) = sqrt(10 - 10) = 0, also impossible. 

This suggests that there's no solution under these conditions. But since the problem exists, I must have misunderstood something. 

Wait, perhaps the given leg is not part of the 30-60-90 triangle? No, because it's a right-angled triangle with a 30° angle, so it must be a 30-60-90 triangle. 

Wait, maybe the given leg is the hypotenuse? No, the problem says it's a leg. 

Wait, let me think outside the box. What if the 30° angle is at T1 instead of T2? Let me check the Angle predicate: MeasureOf(Angle(T3,T2,T1),30). This is the angle at T2, so it's still 30°. 

Wait, maybe the triangle is not a 30-60-90 triangle? But it has a right angle and a 30° angle, so it must be. 

Wait, could the given hypotenuse be one of the legs? No, the hypotenuse is the longest side. 

I'm stuck. Let me try to look for alternative approaches. 

Let me use trigonometry directly. In triangle T1-T2-T3, right-angled at T3, with angle at T2 = 30°. Let's denote:

- Angle at T2: 30°  
- Angle at T3: 90°  
- Angle at T1: 60°  

Let’s denote:

- Side opposite 30° (angle at T2): T1T3 = a  
- Side opposite 60° (angle at T1): T2T3 = b  
- Hypotenuse T1T2 = c  

From trigonometric ratios:

For angle at T2 (30°):

sin(30°) = opposite/hypotenuse = a/c  
cos(30°) = adjacent/hypotenuse = b/c  

Given that, if one of the legs is sqrt(10), let's say a = sqrt(10). Then:

sin(30°) = sqrt(10)/c  
=> 1/2 = sqrt(10)/c  
=> c = 2*sqrt(10)  

But the given hypotenuse is c = sqrt(10), which contradicts. 

If instead, the given leg is b = sqrt(10), then:

cos(30°) = b/c  
=> √3/2 = sqrt(10)/c  
=> c = 2*sqrt(10)/√3 = (2√30)/3 ≈ 3.651...  

But the given hypotenuse is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162, which again doesn't match. 

This suggests that there's no solution under the given constraints, which is impossible. Therefore, I must have made a fundamental error in interpreting the problem. 

Wait, let me check the original predicates again. The LengthOf(Line(T1,T2), SqrtOf(10)) is the hypotenuse. The problem says "one leg measuring √10". Maybe the given leg is the hypotenuse, but the problem says it's a leg? No, it says one leg is √10. 

Wait, could the problem be referring to the leg adjacent to the 30° angle? Let's say the leg adjacent to the 30° angle is x, and the other leg is sqrt(10). Let's try that. 

In this case, the angle at T2 is 30°, and the adjacent side is T2T3 (x), and the opposite side is T1T3 (let's call it y). The hypotenuse is T1T2 = sqrt(10). 

Using trigonometry:

tan(30°) = opposite/adjacent = y/x  
Also, from Pythagoras: x² + y² = (sqrt(10))² = 10  

But we don't know which leg is given. If the given leg is x (adjacent to 30°), then we need more info. But the problem says one leg measures √10. If the given leg is y (opposite 30°), then y = √10. Let's try that.

If y = √10, then:

tan(30°) = y/x => x = y / tan(30°) = √10 / (1/√3) = √10 * √3 = sqrt(30) ≈ 5.477. 

But then, from Pythagoras: x² + y² = (sqrt(30))² + (sqrt(10))² = 30 + 10 = 40, which should equal 10. But 40 ≠ 10, so this is invalid. 

Alternatively, if the given leg is x (adjacent to 30°), then x = √10. Then, from tan(30°) = y/x => y = x tan(30°) = √10 * (1/√3) = √(10/3). Then, hypotenuse squared is x² + y² = 10 + (10/3) = 40/3, so hypotenuse is sqrt(40/3) = (2√30)/3 ≈ 3.651, but the given hypotenuse is sqrt(10) ≈ 3.162. Again, inconsistency. 

This suggests that there's no valid solution under the given conditions, which is impossible. Therefore, I must conclude that there's a misinterpretation of the predicates. 

Wait, going back to the beginning, perhaps the hypotenuse is not Line(T1,T2)? Let me check the predicate IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1,T2), Triangle(...)). Yes, it says Line(T1,T2) is the hypotenuse. So, that's correct. 

Wait, what if the given leg is the hypotenuse? No, the problem says it's a leg. 

Wait, could the given leg be the hypotenuse, and the problem has a translation error? If so, assuming that the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), and one leg is sqrt(10), which is impossible. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that one of the angles is 30°, and one of the legs is sqrt(10), and the hypotenuse is x. But the problem says the hypotenuse is sqrt(10). 

I'm at an impasse. Given that the problem must have a solution, perhaps the correct approach is to proceed with the assumption that the given leg is the longer leg, even though it leads to a hypotenuse of 2*sqrt(10)/√3, and then express x in terms of that. But since the problem states the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), perhaps there's a calculation error in my previous steps.

Let me try again: 

If the hypotenuse is c = sqrt(10), and the angle at T2 is 30°, then the side opposite to 30° is a = c * sin(30°) = sqrt(10) * 1/2 = sqrt(10)/2. The adjacent side is b = c * cos(30°) = sqrt(10) * (√3/2) = sqrt(30)/2. 

So, if the given leg is the adjacent side (b), which is x = sqrt(30)/2, then that is the value of x. 

But the problem says "one leg measuring sqrt(10)". If the given leg is the opposite side (a = sqrt(10)/2), which is not sqrt(10). Hence, this suggests that the problem might have a typo, or I'm missing something. 

Wait, perhaps the problem says that one of the legs is sqrt(10), and the hypotenuse is x? But the problem says the hypotenuse is sqrt(10). 

Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with the assumption that the given leg is the longer leg, and the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), leading to x = sqrt(30)/2, even though it doesn't match the condition of one leg being sqrt(10). Perhaps there was a mistake in the problem's phrasing, and the intended leg is the longer one, and the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), leading to x = sqrt(30)/2. 

Alternatively, if the given leg is the shorter one, and the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), then the shorter leg is sqrt(10)/2, and the longer leg is sqrt(10)*sqrt(3)/2. But the problem says one leg is sqrt(10), so this would mean that the longer leg is sqrt(10), and the shorter leg is sqrt(10)/√3. But then the hypotenuse is 2*(sqrt(10)/√3) = 2*sqrt(10)/√3 = 2*sqrt(30)/3, which is not sqrt(10). 

This is very confusing. Given that, I'll proceed with the calculation where the hypotenuse is sqrt(10), angle at T2 is 30°, and the leg opposite to 30° is a = sqrt(10)/2, and the adjacent leg is b = sqrt(30)/2. Since the problem asks for x, which is the length of Line(T2,T3), which is the adjacent side, x = sqrt(30)/2. 

Even though this doesn't satisfy the condition of one leg being sqrt(10), this might be the intended answer. Perhaps the problem had a typo, and the given leg is the hypotenuse, or there's a miscalculation. 

Therefore, the final answer is x = sqrt(30)/2.

### **Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup**

We are given:

- **Triangle(T1, T2, T3)**: A triangle with vertices labeled T1, T2, and T3.
- **RightAngle(Angle(T1, T3, T2))**: The angle at point T3 is a right angle.
- **MeasureOf(Angle(T3, T2, T1), 30)**: The angle at T2 is 30°.
- **LengthOf(Line(T2, T3), x)**: We are asked to find the length of segment T2T3.
- **LengthOf(Line(T1, T2), SqrtOf(10))**: Segment T1T2 has length √10.
- **IsHypotenuseOf(Line(T1, T2), Triangle(...))**: Segment T1T2 is the hypotenuse.
- **IsSideOf(Line(T2, T3), Triangle(...))**: Segment T2T3 is a side of the triangle.
- **IsSideOf(Line(T1, T3), Triangle(...))**: Segment T1T3 is also a side.
- **Right(Triangle(...))**: Confirms the triangle is right-angled.

From this, we deduce:
- The triangle is right-angled at T3.
- The angle at T2 is 30°, so the triangle is a **30-60-90 triangle**.
- The hypotenuse is T1T2 with length √10.
- The two legs are T1T3 and T2T
