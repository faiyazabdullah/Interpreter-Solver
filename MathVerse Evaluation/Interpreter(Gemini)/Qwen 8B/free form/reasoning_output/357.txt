Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to visualize the quadrilateral ABCD made up of two right-angled triangles, ABC and ACD. The given information includes some angles and side lengths, so I should start by drawing a rough sketch based on the predicates provided.

From the predicates, we know that Triangle ABC and Triangle ACD are right-angled. Specifically, Angle B is 35 degrees, which is angle at point B in triangle ABC. Also, there are several right angles mentioned: Angle BCA (which is part of triangle ABC), Angle CDA (part of triangle ACD), and Angle BCD (which is another right angle). Wait, let me check again. The RightAngle predicates mention Angle(B,C,A) which is angle at B? No, wait, the angle notation is usually vertex in the middle. So Angle(B,C,A) would be angle at point C between points B and A. Wait, no, standard notation is Angle(ABC) means angle at point B between points A and C. But here, the first argument is the vertex? Or is it different?

Wait, the MeasureOf(Angle(A,B,C),35) – that would mean angle at point B, between points A and C. So angle ABC is 35 degrees. Then, RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)) – that's angle at point C between points B and A, so angle BCA is a right angle. Similarly, RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)) would be angle at D between points C and A, so angle CDA is a right angle. And RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)) is angle at C between points B and D, so angle BCD is a right angle. 

So putting this together, quadrilateral ABCD has right angles at C (from BCA and BCD) and at D (from CDA). Let me try to imagine this. Points A, B, C, D form a quadrilateral where ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C, and ACD is another right triangle with right angle at D. Also, since ABC and ACD are connected via point C and D, maybe they share a common side AC?

Let me think about the structure. Since ABC is a right-angled triangle at C, sides AB, BC, and AC form the triangle with right angle at C. Then ACD is another right-angled triangle at D, so sides CD, DA, and AC form the triangle with right angle at D. Therefore, AC is a common hypotenuse for both triangles? Wait, but if ABC is right-angled at C, then AC is one leg, BC is another leg, and AB is the hypotenuse. In triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so AD and DC are legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but then AC would be the hypotenuse of both triangles? That seems possible. Let me confirm with the given data.

Given LengthOf(Line(B,C),13). So BC is 13 units. Since ABC is a right-angled triangle at C, BC is one leg, and AC is another leg. Then AB is the hypotenuse. Also, angle ABC is 35 degrees. So in triangle ABC, angle at B is 35 degrees, right angle at C, so angle at A would be 90 - 35 = 55 degrees.

Now, looking at triangle ACD, which is right-angled at D. We need to find angle ACD, which is angle at C between points A and D. Wait, angle ACD would be part of triangle ACD. Let me clarify the notation. Angle ACD would be the angle at point C between points A and D. But in the quadrilateral ABCD, point C is connected to B and D. Given that there's a right angle at C between B and D (from Angle(B,C,D)), which is angle BCD being a right angle. So angle BCD is 90 degrees. Therefore, at point C, there are two angles: one from triangle ABC (angle BCA, which is 90 degrees) and another from triangle ACD (angle BCD, which is also 90 degrees)? Wait, that would imply that the total angle at point C is 180 degrees? Because angle BCA is between B and A, and angle BCD is between B and D. If those are adjacent, then yes, adding up to 180 degrees. Therefore, point C is a straight line? Wait, that would make ABCD a degenerate quadrilateral? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe the arrangement is such that AC is a diagonal, and the two triangles share the side AC. Let me try to reconstruct.

Alternatively, maybe quadrilateral ABCD is formed by connecting the two right triangles ABC and ADC along the hypotenuse AC. However, since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, and triangle ACD is right-angled at D, then AC would be the hypotenuse of triangle ABC and a leg of triangle ACD. Wait, but in triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so legs would be CD and DA, and hypotenuse AC. Therefore, AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ACD. So AC is the same as the hypotenuse of triangle ABC. Therefore, AC would be the hypotenuse for both triangles ABC and ACD. 

But in triangle ABC, right-angled at C, so AC and BC are legs, AB is hypotenuse. In triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so AD and CD are legs, AC is hypotenuse. Therefore, AC can be found using Pythagoras in triangle ABC. Since BC is 13, and angle at B is 35 degrees. Let me compute AC.

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So tan(angle at B) = opposite / adjacent = AC / BC. Wait, angle at B is 35 degrees. So tan(35°) = AC / BC. Wait, because in triangle ABC, angle at B is 35°, so the opposite side is AC, and adjacent is BC. Wait, no. Wait, angle at B: in triangle ABC, right-angled at C. So the sides relative to angle B: opposite side is AC, adjacent is BC, and hypotenuse is AB. Therefore, tan(angle B) = AC / BC. So AC = BC * tan(35°). Since BC is 13, then AC = 13 * tan(35°).

Calculating that, tan(35°) ≈ 0.7002. Therefore, AC ≈ 13 * 0.7002 ≈ 9.1026. Let me note that down.

Now, moving to triangle ACD, which is right-angled at D. So angle at D is 90 degrees. We need to find angle ACD, which is angle at C in triangle ACD. Let me consider triangle ACD. In triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so the sides are CD, DA, and AC (hypotenuse). To find angle at C (angle ACD), we can use trigonometry. In triangle ACD, angle at C is opposite to DA and adjacent to CD. So tan(angle ACD) = DA / CD. Alternatively, since AC is the hypotenuse, we can relate the sides.

But how do we find DA and CD? Wait, maybe we can find other relations. Also, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, perhaps there are relations between the sides. Let me think. From the given predicates, we have that Line(A,D) and Line(D,C) are perpendicular, which aligns with triangle ACD being right-angled at D. Also, Line(C,A) and Line(B,C) are perpendicular, which matches the right angle at C in triangle ABC.

Another thing: Quadrilateral ABCD is formed by the two triangles. So points A, B, C, D are arranged such that ABC is a right triangle, and ACD is another right triangle sharing the side AC. So the quadrilateral could be like a kite or some other shape, but with two right angles at C and D.

But how to find angle ACD? Let me focus on triangle ACD. In triangle ACD, angle at D is 90°, and we need angle at C (angle ACD). If we can find the ratio of sides around angle C, then we can compute the angle.

We already have AC ≈ 9.1026. Let me denote AC as h (hypotenuse of triangle ACD). Then, in triangle ACD:

AC² = CD² + DA².

But without more information about DA or CD, how can we proceed? Perhaps there's another relationship.

Wait, maybe considering the entire quadrilateral. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral with right angles at C and D. Also, the fact that ABCD is a quadrilateral implies that the sum of its internal angles is 360°. However, with two right angles at C and D, and angles at A and B. But angle at B is given as 35°, and angle at A?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express DA in terms of BC or something else.

Wait, another thought: since ABC is a right-angled triangle at C, and ACD is a right-angled triangle at D, perhaps there's a relation between the sides. Let me try to find coordinates for each point to model this.

Let me assign coordinate system. Let’s place point C at the origin (0,0) for simplicity. Since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, then points B and A can be placed along axes. Suppose point C is at (0,0). Let me assume that BC is along the x-axis, so point B is at (13, 0) since BC=13. Then, since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, point A would be somewhere along the y-axis. Let me denote point A as (0, y), where y is the length AC. Earlier calculation gave us AC ≈ 9.1026. But let's keep it symbolic for now.

Then, coordinates:

C: (0, 0)

B: (13, 0)

A: (0, y), where y = AC = ?

Now, angle at B is 35°, which is angle ABC. In triangle ABC, angle at B is 35°, which we can verify with coordinates.

Vector BA goes from B to A: (-13, y). Vector BC goes from B to C: (-13, 0). The angle at B between BA and BC is 35 degrees. Let me calculate the tangent of that angle. The angle between BA and BC can be found using the slope.

Alternatively, in triangle ABC, tan(angle at B) = AC / BC = y / 13. Which gives y = 13 * tan(35°), confirming earlier calculation. So y = 13 * tan(35°).

Now, moving to triangle ACD, right-angled at D. Point D is connected to C and A. Since ACD is right-angled at D, so point D lies somewhere such that CD is perpendicular to DA. Also, from the predicate Perpendicular(Line(A,D),Line(D,C)), which confirms that AD ⊥ DC.

Since point D is connected to C (which is at (0,0)) and to A (at (0, y)). So line DC is from D to C (0,0), and line DA is from D to A (0, y). These two lines are perpendicular. So vector DC and DA are perpendicular.

Let me denote coordinates of D as (d_x, d_y). Then vector DC is (d_x - 0, d_y - 0) = (d_x, d_y). Vector DA is (0 - d_x, y - d_y) = (-d_x, y - d_y). Their dot product should be zero:

DC • DA = (d_x)(-d_x) + (d_y)(y - d_y) = -d_x² + d_y(y - d_y) = 0

Therefore,

-d_x² + d_y y - d_y² = 0 → d_x² + d_y² = d_y y.

This equation relates coordinates of D. Additionally, since D is part of quadrilateral ABCD, and we have to ensure that the connections are correct. Also, since ACD is a triangle, D cannot coincide with A or C.

Moreover, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the order of the points matters. Assuming the quadrilateral is ordered A-B-C-D-A, but need to confirm. However, given that Line(A,D) and Line(D,C) are present, so D connects to A and C.

But perhaps there's another condition. Since ABCD is a quadrilateral, and we have Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A), Line(A,D), Line(D,C). So the quadrilateral is A-B-C-D-A. Hence, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. But since ABC is a triangle and ACD is another triangle, the connection is such that after point C, we go to D, then back to A.

Now, with point D connected to C and A. Given that, we need to find coordinates of D such that AD ⊥ DC.

Additionally, since angle BCD is a right angle (as per RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D))), which is angle at C between points B, C, D. Since point C is at (0,0), point B is at (13,0), and point D is somewhere. The angle at C between B and D is 90 degrees. Therefore, vectors CB and CD are perpendicular.

Vector CB is from C to B: (13, 0). Vector CD is from C to D: (d_x, d_y). Their dot product should be zero:

CB • CD = 13*d_x + 0*d_y = 13d_x = 0 → d_x = 0.

Wait! This implies that d_x = 0. Therefore, the x-coordinate of D is 0. So point D lies along the vertical line passing through C (since x=0). Therefore, coordinates of D are (0, k) for some k. But since D is connected to A (which is at (0, y)), and the line DA is from D(0,k) to A(0,y), which is a vertical line. However, earlier we had that AD ⊥ DC. But DC is from D(0,k) to C(0,0), which is vertical line. AD is from D(0,k) to A(0,y), also vertical. Wait, that would mean AD and DC are colinear? But they are supposed to be perpendicular. Contradiction!

Hmm, that suggests an error in my reasoning. Let me re-examine.

Earlier, I said that angle BCD is a right angle, which is angle at C between points B, C, D. So vectors CB and CD must be perpendicular. Vector CB is B - C = (13, 0) - (0,0) = (13, 0). Vector CD is D - C = (d_x, d_y) - (0, 0) = (d_x, d_y). Their dot product is 13d_x + 0*d_y = 13d_x. For them to be perpendicular, this must equal zero, hence d_x = 0. Therefore, point D lies directly above or below point C on the y-axis. So D is at (0, k). Now, since triangle ACD is right-angled at D, then DA and DC must be perpendicular. But DA is from D(0,k) to A(0,y): vertical line segment. DC is from D(0,k) to C(0,0): also vertical line segment. Thus, these two segments are colinear, meaning DA and DC are along the same line, making them not perpendicular unless DA or DC is zero-length, which isn't possible. Therefore, contradiction arises.

This suggests an inconsistency in the premises, which likely indicates an error in my interpretation of the angle notation or the setup.

Wait, going back to the original predicates. There is a RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)), which is angle at C between points B, C, D. So angle BCD is the right angle. But according to our previous conclusion, this forces point D to lie on the y-axis. However, this leads to DA and DC being collinear, contradicting the requirement that AD and DC are perpendicular. Therefore, my assumption about the position of point D must be wrong.

Alternative possibility: Maybe the right angle at C is not between B, C, D but elsewhere? Wait, no. The predicate says RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)), which is angle at C between B and D. So angle BCD is indeed the right angle. So there must be another way to resolve this.

Wait, perhaps my coordinate assignment was flawed. Let me try a different approach. Let me consider that triangle ACD is right-angled at D, so angle at D is 90 degrees. Also, angle BCD is 90 degrees (right angle at C). Therefore, at point C, there are two right angles: one from triangle ABC (angle BCA) and another from triangle ACD (angle BCD). Wait, but how can that be? At point C, if there are two right angles, that would require that the two lines CB and CD are perpendicular to CA. Wait, no. Let me think again.

If angle BCA is 90 degrees (from RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)), which is angle at C between B and A), and angle BCD is 90 degrees (angle at C between B and D), then the lines CB and CD are both perpendicular to CA. Therefore, CB and CD are both perpendicular to CA, implying that CB and CD are parallel to each other. But since CB and CD originate from the same point C, this would imply that points B, C, D are colinear, which is impossible unless D lies on line CB extended. But then, how does triangle ACD come into play?

Wait, if CB and CD are both perpendicular to CA, then CB and CD are parallel. But since they both emanate from point C, they must be in the same direction. Therefore, points B and D lie along the same line perpendicular to CA. But in that case, points B and D are aligned with respect to CA. This might be possible.

Let me attempt to reassign coordinates accordingly. Let me suppose that CA is horizontal for simplicity. Let me set point C at (0,0). Let me assume that CA is along the positive x-axis. So point A is at (a, 0), and point C is at (0,0). Then, since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, so CB must be perpendicular to CA. Since CA is along x-axis, CB must be vertical. Therefore, point B would be at (0, b) for some b. But then, BC length would be |b|, and AC length is |a|. Given that BC is 13, then |b|=13. Let me take b=13, so point B is at (0,13). Then, angle at B is angle ABC, which is the angle between BA and BC. Let me calculate that angle.

Point A is at (a,0), point B at (0,13), point C at (0,0). So vector BA is from B to A: (a - 0, 0 - 13) = (a, -13). Vector BC is from B to C: (0 - 0, 0 - 13) = (0, -13). The angle at B is between BA and BC. Using the dot product:

cos(theta) = (BA · BC) / (|BA| |BC|)

BA · BC = (a)(0) + (-13)(-13) = 169

|BA| = sqrt(a² + 13²)

|BC| = 13

Thus cos(theta) = 169 / (sqrt(a² + 169)*13) = 13 / sqrt(a² + 169)

Given that theta is 35 degrees, so:

cos(35°) = 13 / sqrt(a² + 169)

Solving for a:

sqrt(a² + 169) = 13 / cos(35°)

Square both sides:

a² + 169 = 169 / cos²(35°)

Therefore,

a² = 169 / cos²(35°) - 169 = 169 (1 / cos²(35°) - 1 ) = 169 tan²(35°)

Hence, a = 13 tan(35°)

Which matches our earlier calculation. So point A is at (13 tan(35°), 0). Let me compute tan(35°):

tan(35°) ≈ 0.7002, so a ≈ 13 * 0.7002 ≈ 9.1026.

Now, moving to triangle ACD, which is right-angled at D. Also, angle BCD is 90 degrees, which in this coordinate system, point D must satisfy that angle at C between B and D is 90 degrees. Since point B is at (0,13), and point C is at (0,0), the line CB is vertical. For angle BCD to be 90 degrees, line CD must be horizontal, since CB is vertical and angle between CB and CD is 90 degrees. Therefore, line CD is horizontal. Since point C is at (0,0), line CD is horizontal, so point D lies somewhere along the x-axis. Wait, but if CD is horizontal, then point D has the same y-coordinate as C, which is 0. So D is at (d, 0) for some d ≠ 0.

But triangle ACD is right-angled at D. So in triangle ACD, right angle at D. So DA and DC must be perpendicular. Point D is at (d, 0), point C is at (0,0), and point A is at (a, 0). Wait, but then DA is from D(d,0) to A(a,0), which is horizontal line. DC is from D(d,0) to C(0,0), also horizontal. Hence, DA and DC are colinear, making them not perpendicular. Again, contradiction. What's wrong here?

Ah, this suggests that my assumption about the placement of point D is incorrect. How can angle BCD be 90 degrees while also having triangle ACD right-angled at D? It seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the right angle at D in triangle ACD is not between CD and DA, but between AD and DC? Wait, no. If triangle ACD is right-angled at D, then the right angle is between AD and DC. But in this coordinate system, those two segments are colinear, which is impossible. Therefore, there must be an error in my understanding of the configuration.

Let me revisit the original problem statement. The user mentioned that the quadrilateral ABCD is composed of two right-angled triangles ABC and ACD. Angle B is 35°, angle BCD is a right angle, and BC is 13. The predicates include Perpendicular(Line(C,A),Line(B,C)) and Perpendicular(Line(A,D),Line(D,C)). So, Line(C,A) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), which matches our earlier setup where CA ⊥ CB. And Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(D,C), meaning AD ⊥ DC.

So, in this scenario, AD ⊥ DC. But in the previous coordinate system, with point D on x-axis, AD and DC are colinear, violating this. Hence, there must be another configuration.

Perhaps point D is not on the x-axis but somewhere else. Let me try again.

Given that Line(C,A) ⊥ Line(B,C), so CA ⊥ CB. Let me define CA as one axis and CB as another. Let me choose coordinates such that point C is at origin (0,0), CA is along x-axis, and CB is along y-axis. So point A is at (a, 0), point B is at (0, b), point C is at (0,0). Then, BC has length b, which is given as 13. So b=13, thus point B is at (0,13).

Now, angle B is 35°, which is angle ABC. In this setup, point A is at (a,0), point B at (0,13), point C at (0,0). So angle at B is between BA and BC. As before, this angle is determined by the coordinates.

Now, for triangle ACD, right-angled at D, and Line(A,D) ⊥ Line(D,C). So, AD ⊥ DC. Let me find coordinates for D such that this holds.

Let me denote point D as (x, y). Then vector DC is (x - 0, y - 0) = (x, y). Vector DA is (a - x, 0 - y) = (a - x, -y). Their dot product must be zero:

(x)(a - x) + (y)(-y) = 0 → ax - x² - y² = 0 → x² + y² = ax.

Also, since angle BCD is 90°, which is angle at C between points B, C, D. So vectors CB and CD must be perpendicular. Vector CB is from C to B: (0,13) - (0,0) = (0,13). Vector CD is from C to D: (x, y). Dot product is 0*x + 13*y = 13y = 0 → y = 0. So point D must lie on the x-axis. Hence, y=0. Therefore, coordinates of D are (x, 0).

Substituting y=0 into the previous equation x² + y² = ax gives x² = ax → x(x - a) = 0 → x=0 or x=a. But x=0 would put D at (0,0), which is point C, invalid. x=a would put D at (a, 0), which is point A. Hence, this suggests that the only solutions are D=C or D=A, which are trivial and invalid. This is a contradiction, indicating that under this coordinate system, there is no valid D satisfying both conditions. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental flaw in my assumptions. Perhaps the initial configuration is not as I thought. Let me reconsider the structure of the quadrilateral.

Maybe the quadrilateral is not convex? Or perhaps the right angles are not both at C and D? Wait, the given RightAngles are Angle(B,C,A) (right angle at C between B and A), Angle(C,D,A) (right angle at D between C and A), and Angle(B,C,D) (right angle at C between B and D). So at point C, there are two right angles: one between B and A (from triangle ABC), and another between B and D (from angle BCD). This implies that at point C, two lines CB and CD are perpendicular to CA. Hence, CB ⊥ CA and CD ⊥ CA, which means CB and CD are parallel. But since they both originate from C, this would mean that points B and D are on the same line perpendicular to CA. Hence, points B and D are aligned with respect to CA.

Let me try placing CA horizontally again. Let me set point C at (0,0), point A at (a,0). Since CB is perpendicular to CA, and BC is length 13, let me set point B at (0,13) as before. Then, since CD is also perpendicular to CA, point D must lie on the line perpendicular to CA at point C, i.e., the y-axis. So point D is at (0, d) for some d. Now, triangle ACD is right-angled at D. So, in triangle ACD, right angle at D. Let me check the coordinates.

Point D is at (0,d). Point A is at (a,0). Point C is at (0,0). So DA is from D(0,d) to A(a,0): vector (a, -d). DC is from D(0,d) to C(0,0): vector (0, -d). For AD to be perpendicular to DC, their dot product should be zero. Compute DA • DC = (a)(0) + (-d)(-d) = d². For this to be zero, d must be 0, which puts D at C, invalid. Hence, contradiction again.

This suggests that there is no such point D satisfying both conditions, which contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, I must have misinterpreted the angle notations or the configuration.

Wait, let's re-express the given RightAngles:

- RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)): angle at C between B and A, which is angle BCA, so this is the right angle in triangle ABC.

- RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)): angle at D between C and A, which is angle CDA, so this is the right angle in triangle ACD.

- RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)): angle at C between B and D, which is angle BCD, right angle.

Wait, this means that at point C, there are two right angles: one between B and A (angle BCA), and another between B and D (angle BCD). This implies that lines CB and CD are both perpendicular to CA, hence CB and CD are parallel. But since both originate from C, this means that points B and D are on the same line perpendicular to CA, which is the line through C perpendicular to CA. Hence, points B and D are on this line.

But in this case, triangle ACD is right-angled at D. Let me try to define this. Let me set CA as horizontal, C at (0,0), A at (a,0). Then, CB is vertical (since perpendicular to CA), so B is at (0,b). CD is also vertical (since perpendicular to CA), so D is at (0,d). Now, triangle ACD has vertices at A(a,0), C(0,0), D(0,d). This forms a right-angled triangle at D? Let's see: in this case, angle at D is between C and A. So, vectors DC and DA. Vector DC is from D to C: (0 - 0, 0 - d) = (0, -d). Vector DA is from D to A: (a - 0, 0 - d) = (a, -d). The angle at D is between DC and DA. To check if it's a right angle, compute the dot product of DC and DA:

DC • DA = (0)(a) + (-d)(-d) = d². For this to be zero, d must be zero, which is invalid. Hence, again contradiction.

This suggests that the problem as described may have inconsistencies, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me review the original predicates again.

Wait, the given predicates include IsSideOf(Line(A,C),Triangle(A,B,C)) and IsSideOf(Line(A,C),Triangle(A,D,C)), which implies that AC is a side of both triangles ABC and ACD. Hence, AC is shared between both triangles. Also, the predicates say that Line(A,D) and Line(D,C) are perpendicular, so AD ⊥ DC. And Line(C,A) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), so CA ⊥ CB.

With this, let me try to think differently. Let me consider triangle ABC right-angled at C, and triangle ACD right-angled at D. AC is common to both. Let me consider the lengths. In triangle ABC, AC and BC are legs, AB is hypotenuse. In triangle ACD, AD and CD are legs, AC is hypotenuse. Hence, AC is the hypotenuse of triangle ACD, so AC = sqrt(AD² + CD²). Also, in triangle ABC, AC = BC * tan(angle at B) = 13 * tan(35°).

But how to relate AD and CD? Maybe through some other relationship.

Wait, since angle BCD is a right angle (given), which is angle at C between B and D. Since CA ⊥ CB (from RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)), which is angle at C between B and A), and angle BCD is a right angle at C between B and D, this implies that CD is perpendicular to CB. But CB is perpendicular to CA, so CD is parallel to CA? No, if CB is perpendicular to CA, and CD is perpendicular to CB, then CD is parallel to CA. Hence, CD is parallel to CA. 

If CD is parallel to CA, then vector CD is scalar multiple of vector CA. Let me explore this.

Let me denote vector CA as from C to A: A - C = (a, 0) assuming C is at (0,0) and A at (a,0). Then, since CD is parallel to CA, vector CD is k*(a, 0) for some scalar k. Hence, point D is at C + vector CD = (0,0) + (ka, 0) = (ka, 0). But then, point D lies on the x-axis. Now, triangle ACD is right-angled at D. Let me check this.

Point D is at (ka, 0). Point A is at (a, 0). Point C is at (0,0). So DA is from D(ka, 0) to A(a, 0): vector (a - ka, 0) = (a(1 - k), 0). DC is from D(ka, 0) to C(0,0): vector (-ka, 0). For AD to be perpendicular to DC, their dot product should be zero:

DA • DC = (a(1 - k))*(-ka) + 0*0 = -k a² (1 - k) = 0.

This requires either k=0 (which puts D at C, invalid) or 1 - k = 0 → k=1, which puts D at (a, 0), which is point A, also invalid. Hence, again, no solution. 

This suggests that under these constraints, there is no valid configuration, which contradicts the problem's existence. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in interpreting the angle notations or the relationships.

Wait, let's revisit the angle notations. The measure of Angle(A,B,C) is 35°, which is angle at B between A and C. So angle ABC = 35°. RightAngle(Angle(B,C,A)) is angle at C between B and A, which is angle BCA = 90°. RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)) is angle at D between C and A, which is angle CDA = 90°. RightAngle(Angle(B,C,D)) is angle at C between B and D, which is angle BCD = 90°. 

So at point C, there are two right angles: one between B and A (angle BCA = 90°), and one between B and D (angle BCD = 90°). This implies that lines CB and CD are both perpendicular to CA, hence CB || CD. But since both originate from C, this implies that points B and D are on the same line perpendicular to CA. 

Let me try to represent this with coordinates again. Let me set CA as horizontal, C at (0,0), A at (a,0). Then, CB is vertical (since perpendicular to CA), so B is at (0, b). CD is also vertical, so D is at (0, d). Now, triangle ACD has vertices at A(a,0), C(0,0), D(0,d). This forms a right-angled triangle at D? Let's see: the right angle at D would require that AD ⊥ DC. Vector DA is from D to A: (a, -d). Vector DC is from D to C: (0, -d). Their dot product is (a)(0) + (-d)(-d) = d². For this to be zero, d=0, which is invalid. Hence, still no good.

Wait, maybe the right angle in triangle ACD is at C instead of D? But the predicate says RightAngle(Angle(C,D,A)), which is angle at D between C and A, so it's angle CDA, which is at D. So it must be right-angled at D.

This is very confusing. Perhaps the issue is that the problem involves three-dimensional geometry? No, it's a planar figure. Or perhaps there's a miscalculation in assuming the location of D?

Let me try a different approach. Let's forget coordinates and focus on the relationships.

We have two right triangles: ABC (right-angled at C) and ACD (right-angled at D). They share the side AC. Given that angle at B is 35°, BC=13, and angle BCD is 90°. Need to find angle ACD.

Let me denote:

In triangle ABC, right-angled at C, with angle at B = 35°, BC = 13. So, as before, AC = BC * tan(35°) = 13 tan(35°).

In triangle ACD, right-angled at D. Let me denote angle ACD as θ, which is what we need to find. In triangle ACD, angle at D is 90°, so the other two angles are at A and C. Sum of angles is 180°, so angle at A + angle at C + 90° = 180° → angle at A + angle at C = 90°. So angle ACD (θ) + angle CAD = 90°.

If we can find angle CAD, then θ = 90° - angle CAD.

How to find angle CAD? Let's see.

Looking at the whole quadrilateral ABCD. Since ABCD is made of triangles ABC and ACD, and we have certain relationships. Let me consider the full quadrilateral. At point A, we have angle between AB and AD. At point D, angle between DA and DC. At point C, we have angle between DC and CB (90°) and between CA and CB (90°). Wait, but how?

Alternatively, since AC is common to both triangles, and we know AC from triangle ABC. In triangle ACD, AC is the hypotenuse. Let me denote AC = h = 13 tan(35°). In triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so AC² = AD² + CD². But without additional info on AD or CD, this seems unhelpful.

However, there might be another relationship. Since angle BCD is 90°, and angle BCA is 90°, this suggests that points B, C, D are arranged such that CB and CD are both perpendicular to CA. Hence, CB || CD, and therefore, BD is a straight line through C. Wait, if CB and CD are both perpendicular to CA, then they are parallel, and since they both start at C, they must be the same line. Hence, points B and D are on the same line perpendicular to CA at point C. Hence, BD is a straight line through C, with B and D on opposite sides of C.

Assume that, so let me imagine CA as horizontal, C at origin, A at (h, 0), B at (0, b), D at (0, -d), where b and d are positive numbers. Then, CB is from C(0,0) to B(0,b), and CD is from C(0,0) to D(0,-d), both perpendicular to CA.

Now, triangle ACD has vertices at A(h, 0), C(0,0), D(0,-d). This is a right-angled triangle at D. Let's verify: vector DA is from D to A: (h - 0, 0 - (-d)) = (h, d). Vector DC is from D to C: (0 - 0, 0 - (-d)) = (0, d). Dot product DA • DC = h*0 + d*d = d² ≠ 0, unless d=0. Not helpful. So again, this doesn't work.

Wait, but if the right angle is at D, then DA and DC must be perpendicular. In this setup, DA is (h, d) and DC is (0, d). Their dot product is 0*h + d*d = d² ≠ 0. Hence, not perpendicular. So this configuration doesn't satisfy the condition.

What if the right angle is at C? No, the predicate specifies it's at D. 

This suggests that there's a fundamental inconsistency in the problem's setup, or I'm missing a crucial insight. Let me try to think outside the box. Maybe the right angle at D is not between DC and DA, but between AD and CD? Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the right angle is at A? No, the predicate says Angle(C,D,A) is the right angle, which is at D.

Wait, let me try to use trigonometry in triangle ACD. Let me denote angle ACD as θ. In triangle ACD, right-angled at D, so:

sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse = AD / AC

cos(θ) = adjacent/hypotenuse = CD / AC

But I don't know AD or CD. However, maybe there's a relationship between AD and CD through the rest of the figure.

Since angle BCD is 90°, and CB is perpendicular to CA, and CD is perpendicular to CA, as before, then CB and CD are parallel. So, if I consider triangle ABC and the line CD, which is parallel to CB, then perhaps there's some similarity or proportionality.

Let me consider the length of CD. Since CB is 13, and if CD is parallel to CB, then maybe CD is some multiple? But I don't see a direct relation.

Alternatively, since ABC and ACD are both right-angled triangles sharing AC, and with certain angles, maybe there's a way to relate the angles.

In triangle ABC, angle at B is 35°, so angle at A is 55° (since it's a right triangle). In triangle ACD, angle at D is 90°, and angle at C is θ, angle at A is 90° - θ. If I can find angle at A in triangle ACD, then θ = 90° - angle at A.

But how to find angle at A in triangle ACD? Let's consider the full quadrilateral. At point A, we have angle between AB and AD. In triangle ABC, angle at A is 55°, and in triangle ACD, angle at A is 90° - θ. If these two angles at A are related, perhaps through the overall structure.

Wait, in the quadrilateral ABCD, the angle at A is the angle between AB and AD. In triangle ABC, angle at A is 55°, which is between AB and AC. In triangle ACD, angle at A is between AC and AD. So, if I can find the angle between AB and AD, it would be the sum of angle between AB and AC (55°) and angle between AC and AD (90° - θ), assuming the angle at A in the quadrilateral is the sum of these two. But this depends on the orientation.

Alternatively, if AB and AD form a straight line, but that would make the quadrilateral degenerate. Without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say.

But let's assume that the angle at A in the quadrilateral is the sum of the angles from the two triangles. So, angle BAD = 55° + (90° - θ). But without additional information about angle BAD, this might not help.

Alternatively, since ABCD is a quadrilateral, the sum of its interior angles is 360°. We know two right angles at C and D, and angle at B is 35°. Let's calculate the remaining angle at A.

Sum of angles: 360° = angle at A + angle at B + angle at C + angle at D.

Angle at B is 35°, angle at C is 90° (from angle BCA) + 90° (from angle BCD)? Wait, no. At point C, the angles are angle BCA (90°) and angle BCD (90°), but these are adjacent? If the quadrilateral is convex, then the total angle at C would be 90° + 90° = 180°, making it a straight line, which would make the quadrilateral degenerate. But this is possible if points B, C, D are colinear, but then CD would overlap with CB, which is not allowed.

Assuming that, then the sum of angles would be:

angle at A + 35° + 180° + 90° = 360° → angle at A = 360° - 35° - 180° - 90° = 55°. So angle at A is 55°. 

Now, in triangle ACD, angle at A is 90° - θ, and this is equal to 55°, so:

90° - θ = 55° → θ = 35°. 

Wait, this would suggest that angle ACD is 35°. But let me verify this logic.

If the total angle at C is 180° (sum of two right angles), and the total angle at D is 90°, angle at B is 35°, then angle at A is 55°. In triangle ACD, angle at A is 55°, and since
