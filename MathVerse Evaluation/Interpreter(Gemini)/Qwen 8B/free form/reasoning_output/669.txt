QUESTION:
Find the surface area of the following hemisphere. The radius is 74.74 m,

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the surface area of a hemisphere where the radius is given as 74.74 meters. Let me start by recalling what a hemisphere is. A hemisphere is half of a sphere, right? So if I imagine cutting a sphere exactly in half, each part is a hemisphere. Now, when they talk about the surface area of a hemisphere, I should think about whether they mean just the curved part or including the flat circular face.

Wait, the problem says "surface area," which usually includes all surfaces. But sometimes people might refer to just the curved part. Hmm. Let me check my notes or textbook. Oh right! The total surface area of a hemisphere includes both the curved surface and the base (the flat circular part). However, sometimes problems might ask for just the curved surface area. Wait, but the question here doesn't specify, so maybe I need to consider both possibilities? Or perhaps there's a standard convention here.

Wait, let me think again. In many math problems, unless specified otherwise, the term "surface area" for a hemisphere often refers to the total surface area, which includes the base. But I should verify the formula. 

The formula for the total surface area of a hemisphere is 3πr². Wait, how does that come about? Well, the surface area of a full sphere is 4πr². If we take half of that, it would be 2πr² for the curved part. Then adding the area of the base, which is a circle with area πr², gives 2πr² + πr² = 3πr². So yes, total surface area is 3πr². But if the problem was asking only for the curved part, it would be 2πr². 

But since the problem mentions "surface area" without qualification, I think it's safer to assume that they want the total surface area, which includes the base. However, sometimes in certain contexts, like in some engineering or physics problems, they might only consider the curved part. But given that the problem provides the radius directly and asks for surface area, and given that the user mentioned using the provided predicates, let me check the given predicates again.

Looking back at the problem statement, the given predicate is RadiusOf(hemisphere) equals 74.74. There's also an AreaOf(hemisphere) predicate, but no specific details on how that relates. However, the question is to compute the surface area. Since the problem didn't mention anything about excluding the base, I think the correct approach is to calculate the total surface area, which is 3πr². 

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects just the curved surface area. Wait, but in common terminology, when someone refers to the surface area of a hemisphere, especially in mathematics, it's often the total surface area. For example, if you look up surface area of a hemisphere, the formula 3πr² is commonly cited as the total surface area. Let me confirm with an example. Suppose r=1, then total surface area would be 3π(1)^2 = 3π. Curved surface area is 2π. So if the question had said "curved surface area", it would be 2π. But since it's not specified, maybe the answer expected is 3πr². 

But wait, let me check if there's another way. Maybe the problem considers the surface area as just the outer curved part. For instance, if the hemisphere is considered as a three-dimensional object, sometimes the base isn't counted. But in standard geometry textbooks, the total surface area includes the base. 

Since the problem didn't specify, but given that it's a math problem, I think the safest assumption is that they want the total surface area. Therefore, proceed with 3πr². 

So, given that the radius is 74.74 meters, plug that into the formula. Let me write that down. 

First, compute r squared: (74.74)^2. Then multiply by 3π. Then round to two decimal places. 

Let me do the calculation step by step. First, compute 74.74 squared. Let me calculate that. 

Calculating 74.74 squared. Let me note that 74.74 * 74.74. Let me compute this. Alternatively, break it down. 

Alternatively, I can use calculator-like steps. Let me recall that (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². But maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, approximate?

Wait, but I need precise calculation. Let me do it properly. 

74.74 multiplied by 74.74. Let me note that 74.74 is 74 + 0.74. So, (74 + 0.74)^2 = 74² + 2*74*0.74 + 0.74². 

Compute each term:

74² = 5476.

Then 2*74*0.74: first compute 74*0.74. Let me calculate 74*0.7 = 51.8, 74*0.04 = 2.96. Adding them together: 51.8 + 2.96 = 54.76. Multiply by 2: 109.52.

Next term: 0.74² = 0.5476.

Adding all terms: 5476 + 109.52 = 5585.52, plus 0.5476 gives 5586.0676. So, 74.74 squared is approximately 5586.0676 square meters. 

Therefore, multiplying by 3π: 3 * π * 5586.0676. Let me compute that. 

First, compute 3 * 5586.0676 = ?

Well, 5586.0676 * 3. Let me compute 5586 * 3 = 16758. Then 0.0676 * 3 = 0.2028. So total is 16758.2028. 

Now, multiply by π. Assuming π ≈ 3.1415926535... So 16758.2028 * π. 

Let me compute this value. Let me note that π ≈ 3.1416. So 16758.2028 * 3.1416. 

To compute this, perhaps split into parts. Let me do 16758.2028 * 3 = 50274.6084, 16758.2028 * 0.1416. Let me compute that. 

First, 16758.2028 * 0.1 = 1675.82028

Then 16758.2028 * 0.04 = 670.328112

Then 16758.2028 * 0.0016 = ?

Let me compute 16758.2028 * 0.001 = 16.7582028, so times 1.6 would be 16.7582028 * 1.6. Let me compute that: 16.7582 * 1.6 = approx 26.81312. 

So adding up the components:

For 0.1416, it's 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016. So adding those three contributions:

1675.82028 + 670.328112 = 2346.148392 + 26.81312 ≈ 2372.961512. 

Therefore, the total is 50274.6084 + 2372.961512 ≈ 52647.569912. 

So approximately 52647.57 m². But wait, let me check if my approximation of π as 3.1416 is accurate enough. Because if I use more decimal places, the result might vary slightly. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator method here, but since I'm doing manual computation, let me see. Alternatively, use fractions. But maybe better to accept that with π ≈ 3.1416, the value is around 52647.57. However, this seems quite large. Let me check if my earlier steps were correct. 

Wait, the radius is 74.74 meters. Squared is 74.74² ≈ 5586.0676. Then multiplied by 3π. So 5586.0676 * 3 = 16758.2028. Then multiplied by π. Let me check with a different approach. Let me use π ≈ 3.14159265. 

So 16758.2028 × π. Let me compute this as follows: 

We know that 16758.2028 × π ≈ 16758.2028 × 3.14159265. 

If I use a calculator, but since I can't, perhaps I can use the fact that π ≈ 22/7 ≈ 3.142857, but that's a rougher estimate. Let me try with more accurate decimals. 

Alternatively, think that 16758.2028 × π ≈ 16758.2028 × 3.1416. Let me compute 16758.2028 × 3.1416. 

Breaking down:

First, 16758.2028 × 3 = 50274.6084

Then 16758.2028 × 0.1416 = ?

As before, breaking into 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016. 

Which gave us approximately 2372.96. So total is 50274.6084 + 2372.96 ≈ 52647.5684. 

So approximately 52647.57 square meters. Rounded to two decimal places, it would be 52647.57 m². 

Wait, but let me check if my initial assumption about the formula is correct. Because if the problem actually wants only the curved surface area, which is 2πr², then the answer would be double of that. Let me check that. 

If I compute 2πr², then with r² being 5586.0676, then 2×5586.0676 = 11172.1352, multiplied by π ≈ 3.1416 gives 11172.1352 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Again, same process: 11172.1352 × 3 = 33516.4056, plus 11172.1352 × 0.1416. Let me compute that. 

11172.1352 × 0.1 = 1117.21352

11172.1352 × 0.04 = 446.885408

11172.1352 × 0.0016 = approx 17.87541632

Total of these three: 1117.21352 + 446.885408 = 1564.098928 + 17.87541632 ≈ 1581.974344

Adding to the previous 33516.4056 gives 33516.4056 + 1581.974344 ≈ 35098.3799 m². Which is roughly half of the previous total. 

But the problem states that the radius is 74.74 m. Depending on which surface area is required, the answer differs. However, since the problem mentions "surface area" without specifying, I need to decide which one to go with. 

In many standardized tests and textbooks, when asked for the surface area of a hemisphere, it's often the total surface area. For example, according to various sources, the total surface area of a hemisphere is indeed 3πr². However, sometimes problems may consider only the curved part. Given that ambiguity, but considering that the problem didn't specify, but provided the radius, I think the intended answer is likely the total surface area, i.e., 3πr². 

But to make sure, let me think about the units. The radius is given in meters, so the area would be in square meters. Also, the problem says to round to two decimal places. 

Another thought: if the problem had been about volume, it would have been straightforward. But since it's surface area, and given that hemispheres are often discussed in terms of total surface area, I'll proceed with 3πr². 

Thus, proceeding with the calculation of 3π*(74.74)^2. As computed earlier, approximately 52647.57 m². But let me check once more for calculation errors. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculating 74.74 squared. Let me recompute that. 

Calculate 74.74 × 74.74:

Let me compute 74 × 74 = 5476.

Then, 74 × 0.74 = 54.76

Then, 0.74 × 74 = 54.76

And 0.74 × 0.74 = 0.5476

So expanding (a + b)^2 where a = 74 and b = 0.74:

(a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b² = 5476 + 2*(74*0.74) + 0.5476

Earlier, I calculated 74*0.74 as 54.76, so 2*54.76 = 109.52. Then add 5476 + 109.52 = 5585.52, then add 0.5476 gives 5586.0676. Yes, that's correct. 

So that part is correct. Then multiplying by 3π gives us 5586.0676 * 3 = 16758.2028. Then multiply by π. 

Assuming π is taken as 3.14159265, let me compute 16758.2028 × π. 

Using a calculator, if I could, but since I can't, let me use a better approximation. Let me take π ≈ 3.14159265. 

So 16758.2028 × 3.14159265. Let me approximate this as follows:

Note that 16758.2028 × π ≈ 16758.2028 × 3.14159265 ≈ ?

We can write this as 16758.2028 × π ≈ 16758.2028 × 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Alternatively, recognize that π is approximately 22/7 ≈ 3.142857, but that's a bit larger than actual π. Let me compute 16758.2028 × 22/7. 

But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, use linear approximation. 

Alternatively, accept that my earlier estimation of ~52647.57 is close. But perhaps I need to carry out a more precise multiplication. 

Alternatively, since I need to present the answer rounded to two decimal places, maybe I can use a more accurate value of π. Let me use π ≈ 3.14159265. 

Let me compute 16758.2028 × 3.14159265. 

Break this down into 16758.2028 × 3 = 50274.6084 

Plus 16758.2028 × 0.14159265. 

So, compute 16758.2028 × 0.14159265. 

This is equivalent to 16758.2028 × (0.1 + 0.04 + 0.00159265). 

So:

First, 16758.2028 × 0.1 = 1675.82028 

Second, 16758.2028 × 0.04 = 670.328112 

Third, 16758.2028 × 0.00159265 ≈ Let's approximate this. 

First, compute 16758.2028 × 0.001 = 16.7582028 

Multiply that by 1.59265: 16.7582028 × 1.59265. 

Approximate this as 16.7582 × 1.59265. 

Let me compute 16.7582 × 1.5 = 25.1373 

Then 16.7582 × 0.09265 ≈ 16.7582 × 0.09 = 1.508238 and 16.7582 × 0.00265 ≈ 0.0443. Total ≈ 1.508238 + 0.0443 ≈ 1.5525. 

So total ≈ 25.1373 + 1.5525 ≈ 26.6898. 

So third term ≈ 26.6898. 

Adding all three parts: 1675.82028 + 670.328112 = 2346.148392 + 26.6898 ≈ 2372.838192. 

Therefore, total value is 50274.6084 + 2372.838192 ≈ 52647.4466. 

So approximately 52647.45 m². Rounding to two decimal places, that would be 52647.45 m². 

However, due to the approximated nature of the manual calculation, there might be slight discrepancies. To ensure accuracy, perhaps using a calculator would give a more precise value. But given the constraints, I think this is acceptable. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use another approach. Let me calculate 3πr² with r = 74.74. 

First, compute r² = 74.74² = 5586.0676. 

Then multiply by 3: 5586.0676 × 3 = 16758.2028. 

Now multiply by π. Let me use more decimal places for π. Let's say π = 3.141592653589793. 

So, 16758.2028 × π ≈ 16758.2028 × 3.141592653589793. 

Using a calculator (pretending I have one), this would be approximately 16758.2028 × π ≈ 52647.44 m². 

Rounded to two decimal places, that's 52647.44 m². 

But depending on rounding during intermediate steps, it could be slightly different. For example, if I use more precise multiplication steps. 

Alternatively, since the problem allows for rounding to two decimal places, and assuming that the precise calculation would yield something very close to 52647.44, then the answer is 52647.44 m². 

Wait, but let me check with another method. Suppose I use the calculator function here. For example, if I have access to computational tools, I can input 3 * π * (74.74)^2. 

But since I can't, I need to rely on estimates. 

Alternatively, think of π as approximately 3.1416, so 16758.2028 × 3.1416. 

Let me perform the multiplication more accurately. 

16758.2028 × 3.1416. 

Let me write this as:

16758.2028 × 3 = 50274.6084

16758.2028 × 0.1416 = ?

As previously calculated, approximately 2372.96. 

So total is 50274.6084 + 2372.96 = 52647.5684, which rounds to 52647.57. 

Hmm, there's a discrepancy between 52647.44 and 52647.57 depending on the approximation of π. This shows the importance of precise calculation. However, given that the problem requires rounding to two decimal places, and considering that the exact value depends on the precise value of π used, but in most cases, using π ≈ 3.1416 is sufficient for such purposes. 

Therefore, taking π as 3.1416, the result is approximately 52647.57 m². 

But to resolve this, perhaps I can use the exact fraction. Wait, but without knowing the exact value of π, it's impossible. Hence, the answer will depend on the level of precision in π. 

Given that, I think the best approach is to state the answer as 3π*(74.74)^2 and then compute it numerically with π≈3.1416, leading to approximately 52647.57 m². 

But let me check once more for calculation mistakes. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use another formula. For example, if I use the formula for the surface area of a hemisphere, which is 3πr². 

Yes, that's correct. 

So, plugging in r = 74.74:

Surface Area = 3 * π * (74.74)^2. 

Calculating 74.74 squared is definitely 5586.0676. 

Multiplying by 3: 5586.0676 * 3 = 16758.2028. 

Multiply by π: 16758.2028 * π. 

Assuming π ≈ 3.14159265, then:

16758.2028 * π ≈ 16758.2028 * 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Let me use a series expansion or another trick. 

Alternatively, since I know that π ≈ 22/7 ≈ 3.142857. Let me compute 16758.2028 × 22/7. 

First, divide 16758.2028 by 7: 

16758.2028 ÷ 7 ≈ 2394.028971. 

Then multiply by 22: 2394.028971 × 22. 

Calculate 2394.028971 × 20 = 47880.57942 

Add 2394.028971 × 2 = 4788.057942 

Total ≈ 47880.57942 + 4788.057942 ≈ 52668.63736. 

But π is less than 22/7, so this overestimates the value. Hence, the real value is less than 52668.64. Earlier estimations suggested around 52647.57. 

This suggests that with π ≈ 3.1416, the value is approximately 52647.57, which is less than 52668.64. 

Thus, the exact value lies between these two estimates. Given that, I think the precise answer would require a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed with the earlier value of approximately 52647.57 m². 

Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 52647.57 m². 

However, to ensure correctness, let me check using another approach. Suppose I use the value of π as 3.1415926535. 

Let me compute 16758.2028 × π. 

Let me write this as:

Let me consider that 16758.2028 × π = ?

Let me use the fact that π = 3 + 0.1415926535. 

So, 16758.2028 × π = 16758.2028 × 3 + 16758.2028 × 0.1415926535 

As before, 16758.2028 × 3 = 50274.6084 

Now compute 16758.2028 × 0.1415926535. 

Let me approximate this as follows: 

0.1415926535 ≈ 0.14159265 

So, 16758.2028 × 0.14159265 ≈ ? 

Let me use the Taylor series or binomial approximation, but that might not help. Alternatively, approximate as follows:

Let me denote x = 0.14159265 

Then, 16758.2028 × x = ?

Let me note that x ≈ 0.14159265 = 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.00159265. 

So, same breakdown as before. 

Which gives us 1675.82028 + 670.328112 + 16758.2028 × 0.00159265. 

Compute 16758.2028 × 0.00159265 ≈ 16758.2028 × 0.00159265 ≈ ?

Let me approximate 0.00159265 ≈ 0.0016. 

So, 16758.2028 × 0.0016 = 16758.2028 × 0 0016 = 26.81312448. 

So, adding up: 1675.82028 + 670.328112 = 2346.148392 + 26.81312448 ≈ 2372.961516. 

Thus, total is 50274.6084 + 2372.961516 ≈ 52647.5699 m². 

So, approximately 52647.57 m². 

Therefore, rounding to two decimal places, it's 52647.57 m². 

Thus, the surface area of the hemisphere is approximately 52647.57 square meters. 

I think this is the correct answer, assuming the total surface area is required. If the problem had wanted only the curved surface area, it would be half of this, but given the standard interpretation, this should be correct. 

Hence, the final answer is 52647.57 m².
