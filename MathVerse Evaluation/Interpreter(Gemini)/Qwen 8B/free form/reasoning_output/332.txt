====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have points P, M, and S. The given information is that there's a line from M to P and another from M to S. The angle at M, specifically angle PMS, is 50 degrees. Also, S is mentioned as the south cardinal point. The question is asking for the true bearing of P from M.

First, I need to recall what a true bearing means. True bearing is measured clockwise from north. But since S is the south cardinal point, that would mean that the direction towards S is directly south. So, if we consider standard compass directions, North is 0°, East is 90°, South is 180°, and West is 270°, right?

Now, the angle given is angle PMS, which is at point M between points P and S. Since S is south, the line MS is pointing directly south. So, if we imagine standing at point M, facing south (towards S), then the angle between the line MS (south) and MP (the line to point P) is 50 degrees. 

Wait, but bearings are measured clockwise from north. So, if we're trying to find the bearing of P from M, we need to figure out the direction of P relative to north. Let me visualize this. If MS is directly south, then from point M, the direction to S is 180° (south). Now, the angle between MS (south) and MP is 50 degrees. Depending on which side P is located, the bearing could be either east or west of south.

But how do we determine the direction? If the angle PMS is 50 degrees, then depending on whether P is to the east or west of south, the bearing would differ. However, without more information about the position of P relative to S, we might need to infer based on typical conventions. Wait, maybe there's something missing here. Let me think again.

Since S is the south cardinal point, so the line MS is directly south. Then, the angle between MP and MS is 50 degrees. Let me sketch this mentally. At point M, there's a line going south to S, and another line going to P making a 50-degree angle with MS. So, the direction of MP is 50 degrees from south. But bearings are measured from north. So, if the angle from south is 50 degrees, then the bearing from north would depend on the direction (east or west).

If the angle is measured towards the east, then the bearing would be 180° - 50° = 130°, because starting from north, turning clockwise 130° would point us southeast. Alternatively, if it's measured towards the west, then the bearing would be 180° + 50° = 230°, which is southwest. But how do we know which way the angle is measured?

Hmm. The problem statement says "Angle PMS is 50°", which is the angle at M between PM and SM. Since S is south, the direction from M to S is straight down (south). So, the angle between PM and SM is 50 degrees. Therefore, the direction of PM is 50 degrees from south. But depending on which side, east or west, the bearing would vary.

But perhaps there's a convention here. In navigation, bearings are typically measured clockwise from north. So, if we are at point M, looking towards south (which is 180°), then turning 50 degrees towards either east or west. But without knowing the direction of the turn, can we assume it's one way or the other?

Wait, maybe there's a standard assumption here. In many cases, unless specified otherwise, angles in such contexts might be considered to be measured in a particular direction. However, since the problem doesn't specify, maybe we need to express the bearing in terms of the given angle. Alternatively, perhaps there's an implied orientation based on the standard coordinate system.

Alternatively, maybe the angle is measured from the south towards the east or west. For example, if you imagine a compass rose at point M, with S being directly downward. Then, the angle between PM and SM is 50 degrees. If the angle is measured towards the east, then the bearing of P from M would be 180° - 50° = 130°, which is southeast. If measured towards the west, it would be 180° + 50° = 230°, which is southwest. However, since the problem mentions "true bearing," which is typically measured from north, but without additional info, perhaps we need to clarify.

Wait, but maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider coordinate systems. Let's place point M at the origin. Let’s assign coordinates for simplicity. Let’s say M is at (0,0). Since S is the south cardinal point, that would be along the negative y-axis. So, S would be at (0, -d) for some d. Then, the line MS is along the negative y-axis. Now, the angle between MP and MS is 50 degrees. So, the direction of MP forms a 50-degree angle with the negative y-axis. To find the bearing of P from M, which is the angle measured clockwise from north (positive y-axis in standard coordinate systems? Wait no—standard coordinate systems usually have positive x-axis as east, positive y-axis as north. Wait, sometimes in mathematics, the positive y-axis is up, but in navigation, bearings are measured clockwise from north.

So, if we consider the standard Cartesian plane with positive y-axis as north, positive x-axis as east, then the bearing is measured clockwise from the positive y-axis. So, if we have a point P somewhere, its bearing is the angle you rotate clockwise from north (positive y-axis) to get to the direction of P.

In our case, the line MS is pointing south, which is along the negative y-axis. The angle between MP and MS is 50 degrees. So, the line MP is forming a 50-degree angle with the negative y-axis. Depending on which side (left or right) of the negative y-axis the line MP lies, the bearing will change.

Let me draw this mentally. Suppose we are at point M (origin). The negative y-axis is south. If the angle between MP and MS (negative y-axis) is 50 degrees, then MP could be 50 degrees to the east of south or 50 degrees to the west of south. 

Case 1: If MP is 50 degrees east of south, then from the positive y-axis (north), we go clockwise 180° to face south, then turn 50° eastward. That would make the total bearing 180° - 50° = 130°, which is southeast. 

Case 2: If MP is 50 degrees west of south, then from north, we go 180° to south, then turn 50° westward (which would add 50° to the 180°, resulting in 230°, which is southwest.

But the problem doesn't specify the direction of the angle. How can we determine which one it is? Is there any implicit information in the problem that can help us decide?

The original problem states that S is the south cardinal point. It also gives the angle measure as 50°, but not the direction. However, in typical problems like this, unless stated otherwise, angles are often assumed to be in a certain direction. For instance, in some contexts, angles are measured counterclockwise from a reference axis, but in navigation, bearings are clockwise from north.

But in this case, since the angle is between two lines: MP and MS. Given that S is south, and assuming that the angle is measured in the standard mathematical sense (counterclockwise from the positive x-axis), but that may not align with bearings. Alternatively, perhaps we should consider the angle as part of a triangle.

Wait, but without knowing the location of P, can we determine the bearing? Maybe not directly. However, since the question asks for the true bearing of P from M, and given that S is south, maybe there's a way to relate the angle to the bearing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the angle is measured towards the east or west. But without more data, this seems ambiguous. However, in some textbooks or problems, angles involving cardinal directions are often measured in specific ways. For example, if you have a point to the east of south, it's 90° east of south, which would correspond to a bearing of 180° - 90° = 90°, but that's just east. Wait, no—if you are at M, facing south, then turning east would be towards the right (clockwise). So, if the angle is measured towards the east, then the bearing from north would be 180° minus the angle. Similarly, if measured towards the west, adding to 180°.

But since the problem doesn't specify direction, but in the absence of that, maybe we need to state both possibilities? However, the problem seems to expect a unique answer. Hence, perhaps there's an implicit assumption here.

Wait, in the initial setup, the user said "consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point." So, the diagram likely has S as south, and the angle PMS is formed at M between P and S. So, the diagram would show M connected to P and S, with S being directly south. Without seeing the diagram, we have to assume that P is positioned such that the angle is 50°, but the direction depends on the diagram's layout.

However, given that the problem is presented in a way that expects a numerical answer, and given that the angle is 50°, perhaps the bearing is 180° - 50° = 130°, which is southeast. This would be the case if the angle is measured towards the east from south. But why would that be the default assumption?

Alternatively, maybe the angle is measured in the other direction. But without knowing, how can we choose?

Wait, perhaps the term "true bearing" implies that it's measured clockwise from north, and the angle given is part of a triangle where we can compute the bearing. Let me try another approach.

Let me model this with coordinates. Let’s suppose that M is at the origin (0,0). S is the south cardinal point, so its coordinates would be (0, -k) for some k. The line MS is vertical downward. Now, point P is somewhere such that the angle at M between MP and MS is 50°. So, the vector from M to P makes a 50° angle with the vector from M to S (which is pointing south).

To find the bearing of P from M, we need to find the angle measured clockwise from north to the direction of MP.

Let’s denote the direction of MP. Since the angle between MP and MS (south) is 50°, then the direction of MP is 50° from south. Now, if we consider the bearing, which starts from north, then:

If the direction of MP is 50° east of south, then the bearing would be 180° - 50° = 130° (since from north, turning 130° clockwise points to southeast).

If it's 50° west of south, then the bearing would be 180° + 50° = 230° (pointing southwest).

But again, without knowing the direction of the angle, we can’t definitively say which one it is. However, in some contexts, especially when dealing with angles in diagrams, the angle is often measured in a specific direction. For example, in a standard diagram, if you have a point P and S, with S being south, and the angle PMS is given, it might be that P is to the east of south, making the bearing 130°. But this is speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the angle is measured in the same way as a bearing. For instance, if you're measuring the angle from south towards the east, then the bearing would be 180° - 50° = 130°. This seems plausible, as bearings are typically used in navigation where directions are measured from north.

Given that the problem comes from a geometric context, and considering common conventions, it's reasonable to assume that the angle is measured towards the east from south, leading to a bearing of 130°. Thus, the true bearing of P from M is 130 degrees.

Therefore, after careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is 130 degrees.
