QUESTION:
Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2 in blue. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the equation for function g(x), which is a translated version of f(x) = x². The problem gives some geometric predicates, so I should start by understanding those.

First, the given points A and B are Points. Then there's Line(A,B), which means the line connecting points A and B. Also, there are Lines x and y, and they're perpendicular to each other because of the Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y)) predicate. 

Then there are Shapes f and g. Shape f is Blue, and Shape g is Red. The IsVertexOf(A,f) and IsVertexOf(B,g) suggest that points A and B are vertices of these shapes. Wait, but f and g are shapes, maybe they are parabolas? Since f is blue and g is red, and they are translations of each other. 

Also, PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(y)), same for point B lying on lines x and y. That seems like points A and B lie on both lines x and y? But wait, if two lines intersect at a point, then points A and B would lie on both lines, implying they are the intersection point? But there's also Line(x) and Line(y) being perpendicular. Maybe lines x and y are perpendicular lines passing through points A and B?

Wait, the problem mentions that g is a translated version of f. Translating a function involves shifting it horizontally and/or vertically. For example, if f(x) = x² is shifted h units horizontally and k units vertically, the new function becomes g(x) = (x - h)² + k. 

But how do the given predicates relate to this translation? Let me think. The points A and B are vertices of shapes f and g. If shape f is f(x) = x², its vertex is at (0,0). Similarly, shape g, being a translation, would have its vertex shifted. 

The predicate Equals(0,0) and Equals(-2,1) – maybe these are coordinates? Like, perhaps the original vertex of f is at (0,0), and the vertex of g is at (-2,1)? Because translating a parabola moves its vertex. So if the original vertex is at (0,0), and after translation, it's at (-2,1), then the translation vector would be (-2,1). Therefore, the equation for g(x) would be (x + 2)² + 1. 

Let me check the predicates again. There's PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x)) and PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(y)). Since lines x and y are perpendicular, maybe they form axes. If points A and B lie on both lines, that suggests that A and B are the intersection point of lines x and y? Wait, but two lines intersect at one point. Unless lines x and y are not unique. Or maybe A lies on both lines x and y, making it the intersection point. Same for B? But then if A and B are different points, that would mean that lines x and y pass through both A and B, which would make them the same line unless... no, since they are perpendicular. Wait, if lines x and y are perpendicular and both pass through A and B, then A and B must be the same point. But the problem states IsVertexOf(A,f) and IsVertexOf(B,g). So A is a vertex of f, which is the original parabola, and B is a vertex of g. So if A is (0,0), then B would be the vertex of g. 

So if A is the vertex of f, which is (0,0), and B is the vertex of g, then the coordinates of B would be (-2,1), since the translation vector is (-2,1). Therefore, the equation for g(x) would be (x + 2)^2 + 1. 

Looking back at the Equals predicates: Equals(0,0) and Equals(-2,1). These could represent coordinates. So maybe the original vertex is at (0,0) and the translated vertex is at (-2,1). Thus, the translation is h = -2, k = 1. Hence, g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 1. 

I think that's the correct approach. Let me verify. The original function f(x) = x² has vertex at (0,0). After translating left 2 units and up 1 unit, the vertex moves to (-2,1), so the equation becomes g(x) = (x + 2)^2 + 1. This matches the translation described by the predicates. The points A and B are vertices of f and g respectively, so their coordinates correspond to the vertices. The lines x and y being perpendicular might represent the horizontal and vertical axes, with A at the origin and B at (-2,1). 

Therefore, the equation for g(x) is (x + 2)^2 + 1.
