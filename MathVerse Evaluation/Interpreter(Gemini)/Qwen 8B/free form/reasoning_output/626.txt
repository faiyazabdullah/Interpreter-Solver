QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The slope is less than 0. It passes through (0,4) and (4,0). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

State the coordinates of the $x$-intercept in the form $(a, b)$.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the x-intercept of the line y = 4 - x. They mentioned that the line has a negative slope and passes through the points (0,4) and (4,0). Let me start by recalling some basics about linear equations and intercepts.

First, I know that the general form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. In this case, the equation given is y = 4 - x. If I rearrange that, it becomes y = -x + 4. Comparing this to the standard form, the slope (m) is -1 and the y-intercept (b) is 4. That makes sense because when x is 0, y is 4, which matches the point (0,4) they mentioned.

Now, the question asks for the x-intercept. The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. At that point, the y-coordinate is 0. To find the x-intercept, I need to set y to 0 in the equation and solve for x. 

So substituting y = 0 into the equation:
0 = -x + 4
Adding x to both sides gives:
x = 4

Therefore, the x-intercept should be at (4, 0). Wait, but looking back at the given points, (4,0) is one of the points the line passes through. That seems correct because when x is 4, y would be 4 - 4 = 0. 

But let me double-check. Maybe there's another way to think about this. The line passes through (0,4) and (4,0). The x-intercept is where it crosses the x-axis, so that's when y=0. Since we already have the equation, solving for x when y=0 gives x=4, confirming the intercept is at (4,0). 

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of intercepts. The x-intercept can also be found by knowing two points on the line. The line goes from (0,4) to (4,0). The change in y is 0 - 4 = -4, and the change in x is 4 - 0 = 4. The slope is rise over run, which is -4/4 = -1, matching our previous calculation. 

Since the line crosses the x-axis at (4,0), that's the x-intercept. Therefore, the coordinates are (4, 0). But wait, the problem says "state the coordinates of the x-intercept", so the answer should be (4, 0). However, I need to make sure that there isn't any confusion here. Sometimes people mix up x and y intercepts, but since the x-intercept is where y=0, the point is (x, 0). 

Another way to verify is to plug in x=4 into the original equation. y = 4 - 4 = 0, so yes, (4,0) is indeed on the line. Therefore, the x-intercept is (4,0). 

I think that's solid. All methods point to the same conclusion. There's no ambiguity here because the line is defined by those two points, and the intercepts are straightforward. So the final answer should be (4, 0).
