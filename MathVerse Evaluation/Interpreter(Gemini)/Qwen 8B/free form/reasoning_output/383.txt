MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a right-angled triangle with some given information. Let me start by recalling the given predicates and what they mean.

First, Triangle(A,B,C). That tells me points A, B, C form a triangle. Then there's RightAngle(Angle(A)). Wait, Angle(A) – so maybe angle at point A is a right angle? Because usually, angles in triangles are denoted by their vertex. But I need to check the other predicates to confirm.

Next, MeasureOf(Angle(B),60). So angle at point B is 60 degrees. Similarly, MeasureOf(Angle(C),30). So angle at point C is 30 degrees. Also, LengthOf(Line(A,B), SqrtOf(3)). So the length of segment AB is √3. 

Then IsHypotenuseOf(Line(B,C), Triangle(A,B,C)). Hmm, hypotenuse is the longest side opposite the right angle. If Line(B,C) is the hypotenuse, then the right angle must be at point A because hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Wait, but earlier it said RightAngle(Angle(A)), so angle at A is the right angle. Therefore, sides AB and AC are the legs, and BC is the hypotenuse. But wait, the predicate says IsHypotenuseOf(Line(B,C)... So line BC is the hypotenuse. So yes, that would make sense if the right angle is at A. 

Also, IsSideOf(Line(A,B), Triangle(A,B,C)) and IsSideOf(Line(A,C), Triangle(A,B,C)). So AB and AC are sides of the triangle. And then Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)),x). So we need to find the length of BC, which is labeled as x. 

Additionally, Right(Triangle(A,B,C)) confirms it's a right triangle. Perpendicular(Line(A,B), Line(A,C)) means that AB is perpendicular to AC, which aligns with the right angle at A. 

The sum of the angles is 180 degrees, which checks out since 90 + 60 + 30 = 180. 

So putting this together: We have a right-angled triangle at A, with angles 90°, 60°, and 30°. The side AB has length √3. Need to find the length of BC, which is the hypotenuse.

Wait, but in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. The side opposite 30° is the shortest one, then the side opposite 60° is √3 times that, and hypotenuse is twice the shortest side. 

But first, let's figure out which sides correspond to which angles. In triangle ABC, with right angle at A. So angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 30°. Therefore:

- Side opposite angle A (right angle) is BC, which is the hypotenuse.
- Side opposite angle B (60°) is AC.
- Side opposite angle C (30°) is AB.

Given that AB is opposite angle C (which is 30°), so AB corresponds to the side opposite 30°, which in the standard 30-60-90 triangle is the shorter leg. Then AC, opposite 60°, is longer leg, and BC is hypotenuse.

Given that AB = √3. Since AB is the shorter leg (opposite 30°), then the longer leg AC should be AB * √3. Then hypotenuse BC is 2 * AB.

Wait, but let me verify that. In a 30-60-90 triangle:

- The side opposite 30° is half the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite 60° is (√3)/2 times hypotenuse.

Alternatively, if the hypotenuse is h, then:

- Shorter leg (opposite 30°): h / 2
- Longer leg (opposite 60°): (h√3)/2

Alternatively, ratios:

Shorter leg : Longer leg : Hypotenuse = 1 : √3 : 2

Therefore, if AB is the shorter leg (opposite 30°), then AB = 1 unit, longer leg AC = √3 units, hypotenuse BC = 2 units.

But in our case, AB is given as √3. So scaling factor here is such that the shorter leg is √3. Therefore, the hypotenuse would be 2 * √3?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the shorter leg is AB = √3. Then according to the ratio, shorter leg is 1 part, longer leg is √3 parts, hypotenuse is 2 parts. Therefore, each "part" is equal to AB. Wait, if AB is the shorter leg, which is 1 part. So if AB = √3, then each part is √3. Therefore, hypotenuse BC is 2 parts, so BC = 2 * √3.

Wait, but let me check with another approach. Using trigonometry.

Since angle at B is 60°, angle at C is 30°, right angle at A. So considering triangle ABC:

tan(angle at B) = opposite / adjacent. At angle B (60°), the opposite side is AC, and adjacent is AB.

So tan(60°) = AC / AB. Since tan(60°) is √3, so √3 = AC / AB. Given AB = √3, so AC = √3 * √3 = 3.

Then hypotenuse BC can be found via Pythagoras: AB² + AC² = BC².

AB is √3, so AB² = 3. AC is 3, so AC² = 9. Sum is 3 + 9 = 12. Thus BC = sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3).

Alternatively, since in a 30-60-90 triangle, hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Here, the shorter leg is AB (opposite 30°), which is √3. Therefore hypotenuse BC = 2 * √3. Which matches the previous calculation.

So the length of BC is 2√3. Hence x equals 2√3.

Let me cross-verify with another method. Since angle at C is 30°, the side opposite to it is AB, which is √3. So sin(30°) = opposite / hypotenuse = AB / BC. Sin(30°) is 1/2, so 1/2 = √3 / BC → BC = 2√3. Yep, same result.

Therefore, the answer should be 2√3. So x equals 2√3.
