FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out how to find the length of BD given all these conditions. So first, I need to parse all the given predicates and see how they relate to each other. Let me start by listing out all the information provided.

We have points A, B, C, D, E. There are several lines connecting them: Line(A,B), Line(B,C), Line(C,A), so triangle ABC is formed. Then there's Line(C,E), Line(A,D), Line(B,D), Line(D,E). Also, Triangle(A,C,E) and Triangle(B,C,E) are mentioned, along with Triangle(A,D,B) and Triangle(C,D,E). 

Angles given: MeasureOf(Angle(C,A,E),61°) and MeasureOf(Angle(C,B,E),73°). LengthOf(Line(C,E),25). Also, some perpendicularity conditions: Perpendicular(Line(C,E),Line(A,B)), Perpendicular(Line(A,D),Line(B,C)). And RightAngle for Angle(A,E,C) and Angle(B,D,A). Additionally, PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(B,C)) and PointLiesOnLine(E,Line(A,B)), and some intersection points like IntersectAt(Line(A,D),Line(B,C),Line(B,D),Point(D)) and others.

So the main goal is to find BD. Let me sketch mentally the diagram based on these. Since there are several triangles and perpendicular lines, maybe coordinate geometry could help here? Assign coordinates to points and compute?

First, since there are perpendicular lines, perhaps we can set up coordinates such that certain lines are aligned with axes. For example, since Line(C,E) is perpendicular to Line(A,B), and Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(B,C). Also, there's a right angle at A for Angle(A,E,C), meaning that Line(A,E) is perpendicular to Line(C,E)? Wait, no. Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C)) means that the angle at point E between points A, E, C is a right angle. Wait, Angle(A,E,C) would be the angle at E between A-E-C. But since Line(C,E) is perpendicular to Line(A,B), and if A-E is part of that... Hmm, maybe it's better to assign coordinates step by step.

Let me consider placing point C somewhere. Let me think. Let me assume coordinates for simplicity. Let me take point C at origin (0,0) because there are several lines connected to it. Then, since Line(C,E) is perpendicular to Line(A,B). Let me suppose that Line(A,B) is horizontal, so Line(C,E) would be vertical. Wait, but also, there's a right angle at A for Angle(A,E,C). That is, Angle at E between A-E-C is a right angle. Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.

Wait, the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C)) means that the angle at E between A-E and E-C is a right angle. Therefore, vectors EA and EC are perpendicular. So if I can assign coordinates where E has coordinates such that EA and EC are perpendicular. Also, Line(C,E) is perpendicular to Line(A,B). So Line(A,B) is perpendicular to Line(C,E). If Line(C,E) is vertical, then Line(A,B) is horizontal. So let me try setting up coordinates accordingly.

Let me fix coordinate system. Let me set point C at (0,0). Since Line(C,E) is perpendicular to Line(A,B), and if I make Line(C,E) vertical, then Line(A,B) is horizontal. Suppose E lies along the y-axis. So point E is (0, e_y) for some e_y. But since there's a right angle at E between A-E-C, which would mean that vector EA is horizontal and vector EC is vertical? Wait, no. Because if Angle at E between A-E-C is right angle, then EA and EC are perpendicular. So if E is (0,e), then line EC goes from E(0,e) to C(0,0), which is vertical. Then line EA should be horizontal. Therefore, point A must lie along the horizontal line passing through E. Wait, but E is on Line(A,B). From the predicate, PointLiesOnLine(E,Line(A,B)), so E is on AB. So AB is a horizontal line. Let me try to formalize this.

Let me define coordinates:

Let’s set point C at (0,0).

Since Line(C,E) is perpendicular to Line(A,B), and assuming Line(C,E) is vertical (as per previous thought), then Line(A,B) is horizontal. Let me denote Line(A,B) as horizontal. Let me suppose that point E is somewhere along the vertical line through C, so since Line(C,E) is vertical, then E has same x-coordinate as C. Since C is at (0,0), then E is (0, k) for some k. However, since E lies on Line(A,B), which is horizontal. So Line(A,B) is horizontal, and passes through E. Therefore, E must be a point on Line(A,B), which is horizontal. Therefore, if E is on Line(A,B), then E must have the same y-coordinate as A and B. But earlier assumption was that Line(C,E) is vertical, so E is vertically aligned with C. Thus, if C is at (0,0), then E is at (0, y_E). But since E is on Line(A,B), which is horizontal, then the y-coordinate of E must be equal to the y-coordinate of A and B. Therefore, the y-coordinate of E is same as A and B. Therefore, if E is at (0, y_E), then Line(A,B) is horizontal at height y_E. Therefore, points A and B are on this horizontal line. Also, since Line(C,E) connects C(0,0) to E(0, y_E), which is vertical. 

But also, Angle(A,E,C) is a right angle. So angle at E between A-E and E-C is right. Since E is on Line(A,B), and EC is vertical. So EA is horizontal, as Line(A,B) is horizontal. Therefore, EA is horizontal, EC is vertical, hence they are perpendicular. Perfect! So that satisfies the RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C)) condition.

Now, since Line(C,E) is vertical (from (0,0) to (0, y_E)), and Line(A,B) is horizontal. Now, we know that CE has length 25. CE is the distance between C(0,0) and E(0, y_E), so |y_E| = 25. Assuming positive direction, y_E = 25. So E is at (0, 25). Then, Line(A,B) is horizontal line passing through E(0,25). So points A and B are somewhere on this horizontal line. Let me denote coordinates for A and B. Let me suppose that A is at (a, 25) and B is at (b, 25). But we need more constraints.

Also, there is a triangle ABC. Points A, B, C form a triangle. Since C is at (0,0), and A and B are on the horizontal line y=25. So triangle ABC has vertices at A(a,25), B(b,25), C(0,0). Also, there is another triangle ACE, which is triangle A-C-E. Since E is (0,25), and C is (0,0), so line CE is vertical. Then, triangle ACE has points A(a,25), C(0,0), E(0,25). 

Given that angle CAE is 61 degrees. Let's recall that angle at A between points C-A-E. So angle at A between CA and AE. Let me calculate this angle using coordinates. Vector AC is from A to C: (0 - a, 0 - 25) = (-a, -25). Vector AE is from A to E: (0 - a, 25 - 25) = (-a, 0). So angle between vectors AC and AE at point A. To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (AC · AE) / (|AC| |AE|)

Compute AC · AE = (-a)(-a) + (-25)(0) = a².

|AC| = sqrt(a² + 25²)

|AE| = sqrt(a² + 0²) = |a|

Therefore,

cos(theta) = a² / (sqrt(a² + 625) * |a| )

Assuming a ≠ 0, we can simplify:

If a > 0, then |a| = a, so cos(theta) = a²/(a*sqrt(a² + 625)) ) = a / sqrt(a² + 625)

Similarly, theta is angle CAE, which is given as 61 degrees. Therefore:

cos(61°) = a / sqrt(a² + 625)

Let me write this equation:

cos(61°) = a / sqrt(a² + 625)

Let me square both sides:

cos²(61°) = a² / (a² + 625)

Multiply both sides by denominator:

cos²(61°)*(a² + 625) = a²

Expand left side:

cos²(61°)*a² + 625*cos²(61°) = a²

Bring terms with a² to left:

cos²(61°)*a² - a² = -625*cos²(61°)

Factor a²:

a² [cos²(61°) - 1] = -625*cos²(61°)

Note that cos²θ - 1 = -sin²θ, so:

a² (-sin²(61°)) = -625*cos²(61°)

Multiply both sides by -1:

a² sin²(61°) = 625 cos²(61°)

Then divide both sides by sin²(61°):

a² = 625 cos²(61°) / sin²(61°) = 625 cot²(61°)

Take square root:

a = ±25 cot(61°)

But since angle CAE is measured at point A, depending on the position of A relative to C and E. Given that E is at (0,25), and C is at (0,0), and A is on the horizontal line y=25. If a is positive, then A is to the right of E (since E is at x=0). If a is negative, A is to the left. Let me assume that A is to the right of E, so a is positive. Therefore, a = 25 cot(61°). Let me compute cot(61°). Cotangent is 1/tangent, so tan(61°) ≈ tan(60° + 1°). Let me check calculator values.

Alternatively, let me note that cot(61°) = tan(90° - 61°) = tan(29°). So cot(61°) = tan(29°). Let me compute tan(29°). Using calculator approximations, tan(29°) ≈ 0.5543. Therefore, a ≈ 25 * 0.5543 ≈ 13.8575. So approximately 13.86. Let me keep this as exact expressions for now.

So a = 25 cot(61°). Alternatively, using exact trigonometric identities.

But maybe I can proceed without calculating numerical values yet. Let me hold onto that.

Now, moving on. We also have another angle given: angle CBE is 73 degrees. So angle at B between points C-B-E. Similarly, let's analyze this. Let me find coordinates for point B. Let me denote point B as (b, 25). Then, similar to point A, we can perform similar analysis for angle CBE.

Angle CBE is the angle at B between points C-B-E. So vectors BC and BE. Vector BC is from B to C: (0 - b, 0 - 25) = (-b, -25). Vector BE is from B to E: (0 - b, 25 - 25) = (-b, 0). So similar to before, the angle between vectors BC and BE at point B. Again, using dot product:

cos(theta) = (BC · BE)/(|BC| |BE|)

Compute BC · BE = (-b)(-b) + (-25)(0) = b².

|BC| = sqrt(b² + 25²)

|BE| = sqrt(b² + 0²) = |b|

Thus,

cos(theta) = b² / (sqrt(b² + 625) * |b| )

Again, assuming b > 0 (if B is to the right of E, which may depend on configuration). But let's suppose that B is located such that angle CBE is 73 degrees. So:

cos(73°) = b / sqrt(b² + 625)

Following similar steps as before, squaring both sides:

cos²(73°) = b² / (b² + 625)

Which leads to:

b² = 625 cot²(73°)

Hence, b = 25 cot(73°)

Again, cot(73°) = tan(90° - 73°) = tan(17°). Let me compute tan(17°). Approximately, tan(17°) ≈ 0.3057. Hence, b ≈ 25 * 0.3057 ≈ 7.6425. So approximately 7.64.

But wait, this depends on the direction of B. If B is to the left of E, then b would be negative. However, considering the rest of the diagram, especially the presence of point D and other lines, we need to ensure consistency. Let me think about the positions of points A and B. If A is to the right of E (positive a) and B is to the left of E (negative b), then AB would span from A (right) to B (left), passing through E. But E is on line AB, which is consistent with the predicate PointLiesOnLine(E, Line(A,B)). So that seems okay.

But let me confirm. Let me assume that A is to the right of E (so a positive), and B is to the left of E (so b negative). Then, line AB spans from A (a,25) to B (b,25), passing through E (0,25). That works. So for example, if a = 13.86 and b = -7.64, then AB goes from (13.86,25) to (-7.64,25), crossing E at (0,25). That fits.

So now, we have coordinates for A, B, C, E. Now, need to find coordinates for D. Let me look at the other given predicates.

There are several lines involving D: Line(A,D), Line(B,D), Line(D,E). Also, Triangle(A,D,B) exists. Also, Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)). Also, PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(B,C)), and IntersectAt(Line(A,D), Line(B,C), Line(B,D), Point(D)). So D is the intersection point of Line(A,D) and Line(B,C), and also lies on Line(B,C). Wait, because PointLiesOnLine(D, Line(B,C)) is given, so D is on Line(B,C). Also, Line(A,D) intersects Line(B,C) at D, which is already on Line(B,C). Therefore, D is the intersection point of Line(A,D) and Line(B,C). Wait, but Line(A,D) starts at A and goes through D, and Line(B,C) is from B to C. So D is a point on Line(B,C) such that Line(A,D) passes through D. Wait, but since D is on Line(B,C), then Line(A,D) is the line connecting A to D, which is on Line(B,C). Therefore, Line(A,D) is a line from A to some point D on Line(B,C). Also, Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(B,C). Because Perpendicular(Line(A,D), Line(B,C)) is given. Therefore, Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(B,C).

So Line(B,C) is from B to C. Earlier, we had coordinates for B as (b,25) and C at (0,0). So Line(B,C) goes from (b,25) to (0,0). The slope of Line(B,C) is (0 - 25)/(0 - b) = (-25)/(-b) = 25/b. Therefore, the slope of Line(B,C) is 25/b. Since Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), its slope is the negative reciprocal: -b/25.

But Line(A,D) connects point A(a,25) to D, which is on Line(B,C). Let me parametrize Line(B,C). Parametric equations for Line(B,C): starting at B(b,25) going towards C(0,0). Any point on Line(B,C) can be written as (b - tb, 25 - t*25) where t ∈ [0,1]. Wait, more generally, parameterizing from point B to C, the parametric equations can be expressed as:

For Line(B,C): x = b - b*t, y = 25 - 25*t, where t ≥ 0. Wait, actually, when t=0, we are at B(b,25); when t=1, we are at C(0,0). So general point D on Line(B,C) can be represented as (b*(1 - t), 25*(1 - t)) for t ≥ 0? Or maybe better to express with a different parameter.

Alternatively, since Line(B,C) can be parametrized as follows. The vector from B to C is (-b, -25). So parametric equations: any point on Line(B,C) is B + s*(vector BC) = (b, 25) + s*(-b, -25) = (b - sb, 25 - 25s), where s ∈ ℝ.

So point D lies on Line(B,C), so coordinates of D are (b(1 - s), 25(1 - s)) for some s.

Additionally, Line(A,D) must be perpendicular to Line(B,C). The slope of Line(B,C) is m_BC = (0 - 25)/(0 - b) = 25/b. Therefore, slope of Line(A,D) must be -b/25.

Let me compute the slope of Line(A,D). Point A is (a,25), and point D is (b(1 - s), 25(1 - s)). So slope of AD is [25(1 - s) - 25]/[b(1 - s) - a] = [25(1 - s - 1)]/[b(1 - s) - a] = [ -25s ] / [b(1 - s) - a ]

This slope must equal -b/25. Therefore:

[ -25s ] / [b(1 - s) - a ] = -b/25

Multiply numerator and denominator:

-25s / [b - bs - a] = -b/25

Cross-multiplying:

-25s * 25 = -b [b - bs - a]

Simplify left side: -625s

Right side: -b(b - bs - a) = -b^2 + b^2 s + ab

So:

-625s = -b^2 + b^2 s + ab

Bring all terms to left:

-625s - b^2 s + b^2 - ab = 0

Factor s:

s(-625 - b^2) + (b^2 - ab) = 0

Solve for s:

s = (ab - b^2)/(625 + b^2)

Therefore, once we have values for a and b, we can compute s and thus find coordinates of D.

Once we have coordinates of D, then BD can be computed as the distance between B(b,25) and D.

But we need to find BD. Let me note that.

But first, we need to find a and b. Recall that earlier, we found a = 25 cot(61°) and b = 25 cot(73°). Let me compute those numerically.

First, compute a:

cot(61°) = 1/tan(61°). Let me calculate tan(61°). Using calculator input: tan(61°) ≈ 1.8040. Therefore, cot(61°) ≈ 1 / 1.8040 ≈ 0.5543. So a ≈ 25 * 0.5543 ≈ 13.8575.

Similarly, for b: cot(73°) = 1/tan(73°). Tan(73°) ≈ 3.2709. Therefore, cot(73°) ≈ 1 / 3.2709 ≈ 0.3057. Hence, b ≈ 25 * 0.3057 ≈ 7.6425. Wait, but earlier I thought that B is to the left of E, so b should be negative. Wait, but according to our earlier assumption, if B is to the left of E, then since E is at (0,25), then b would be negative. But in my calculation above, I considered b as positive. Wait, let me re-examine.

Earlier, when analyzing angle CBE, I assumed that b is positive, but if B is to the left of E, then b should be negative. So perhaps there was a mistake here. Let me check again.

The angle CBE is at point B between points C-B-E. If point B is to the left of E (i.e., x-coordinate less than 0), then vector BC is from B to C: (0 - b, 0 - 25) = (-b, -25). Vector BE is from B to E: (0 - b, 25 - 25) = (-b, 0). So regardless of whether b is positive or negative, the calculation for the angle remains the same. However, when I solved for b, I got b = 25 cot(73°). But if B is to the left of E, then b is negative. Therefore, cot(73°) is positive, so b would be negative. Therefore, b = -25 cot(73°). Wait, no. Wait, the equation was:

From earlier steps:

cos(theta) = b / sqrt(b² + 625). But if B is to the left of E, then b is negative. However, the cosine of an angle is positive if the angle is acute (between 0 and 90°), which is the case here since 73° is acute. Therefore, cos(theta) must be positive. Therefore, even if b is negative, the RHS would be negative, leading to contradiction. Therefore, my initial assumption that b is negative is wrong. Therefore, b must be positive. Which suggests that point B is to the right of E. Wait, but then E is between A and B? Wait, but E is on Line(A,B). So if both A and B are to the right of E, then E would be between them? No, if E is on Line(A,B), then either E is between A and B, or outside. Wait, if both A and B are to the right of E, then E would be to the left of both. But given that E is on Line(A,B), which is horizontal at y=25, and C is at (0,0). So, for instance, if A is at (a,25) and B is at (b,25), with a and b positive, then E is at (0,25), lying on Line(A,B). Therefore, E is between A and B only if 0 is between a and b. But if both a and b are positive, then E at x=0 is to the left of both A and B. So in this case, Line(A,B) extends from A(a,25) to B(b,25), with E at (0,25) being to the left of both. Therefore, the order would be E---A----B or E---B----A depending on a and b. Wait, but if a and b are both positive, then E is to the left of both A and B. Therefore, in this case, the segment AB does not include E unless E is between A and B. Therefore, there's inconsistency here. So my previous assumption that E is on Line(A,B) implies that E lies between A and B, or beyond one of them. But given that angle CAE and angle CBE are given, which involve points A, B, C, E, it's likely that E is between A and B. Therefore, there's a contradiction in the current setup. Therefore, perhaps my initial coordinate assignment needs adjustment.

Alternative approach: Maybe E is between A and B. Therefore, Line(A,B) has points A---E---B. Therefore, in coordinates, if E is at (0,25), then A and B are on opposite sides of E. So one of them is to the left (negative x) and the other to the right (positive x). Let me adjust that.

Suppose that A is to the left of E, and B is to the right of E. Therefore, A has x-coordinate negative, B has x-coordinate positive. Then, Line(A,B) passes through E(0,25). In this case, for angle CAE, which is at A between C-A-E. With A to the left of E, C is at (0,0). So vector AC would go from A to C, and vector AE would go from A to E. These two vectors would have an angle at A. Similarly for angle CBE.

So let's redefine variables. Let me assume that A is to the left of E, so a < 0, and B is to the right of E, so b > 0. Therefore, in previous equations for angle CAE and angle CBE, the values of a and b would be negative and positive respectively. Let me redo the earlier calculations with this in mind.

Starting with angle CAE. For point A at (a, 25), where a < 0. Then vector AC is from A to C: (0 - a, 0 - 25) = (-a, -25). Vector AE is from A to E: (0 - a, 25 - 25) = (-a, 0). So the angle between these vectors. As before, the dot product gives:

cos(theta) = [(-a)(-a) + (-25)(0)] / (|AC| |AE|) = a² / (sqrt(a² + 625) * |a| )

Here, since a is negative, |a| = -a. So:

cos(theta) = a² / [sqrt(a² + 625) * (-a) ] = -a / sqrt(a² + 625)

But theta is the angle CAE, which is given as 61 degrees. Cosine of 61 degrees is positive, so the RHS must be positive. Therefore, -a must be positive => a is negative, which matches our assumption. Therefore, the equation becomes:

cos(61°) = -a / sqrt(a² + 625)

Solving similarly:

Square both sides:

cos²(61°) = a² / (a² + 625)

Which leads to:

a² = 625 cos²(61°) / sin²(61°) = 625 cot²(61°)

Therefore, a = -25 cot(61°), since a is negative. Similarly for angle CBE: point B is at (b, 25), b > 0. Vector BC is from B to C: (0 - b, 0 - 25) = (-b, -25). Vector BE is from B to E: (0 - b, 25 - 25) = (-b, 0). So the dot product is:

cos(theta) = [(-b)(-b) + (-25)(0)] / (|BC| |BE|) = b² / (sqrt(b² + 625) * |b| )

Since b > 0, |b| = b. Therefore:

cos(theta) = b² / [sqrt(b² + 625) * b ] = b / sqrt(b² + 625)

Which equals cos(73°). Therefore:

cos(73°) = b / sqrt(b² + 625)

Which leads to:

b² = 625 cot²(73°)

Hence, b = 25 cot(73°)

Therefore, with this corrected sign, we have:

a = -25 cot(61°)

and

b = 25 cot(73°)

Now, let me compute these values numerically.

First, calculate cot(61°) and cot(73°). 

As before, cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ).

Calculating tan(61°): Using calculator, tan(61°) ≈ 1.8040, so cot(61°) ≈ 1 / 1.8040 ≈ 0.5543. Therefore, a ≈ -25 * 0.5543 ≈ -13.8575.

For cot(73°): tan(73°) ≈ 3.2709, so cot(73°) ≈ 1 / 3.2709 ≈ 0.3057. Hence, b ≈ 25 * 0.3057 ≈ 7.6425.

So now, coordinates:

A is at (a, 25) ≈ (-13.8575, 25)

B is at (b, 25) ≈ (7.6425, 25)

C is at (0, 0)

E is at (0, 25)

Now, need to find coordinates of D. Remember that D is on Line(B,C), and Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(B,C).

Line(B,C) goes from B(7.6425, 25) to C(0,0). Its slope is (0 - 25)/(0 - 7.6425) = (-25)/(-7.6425) ≈ 3.2709. Which matches tan(73°), as expected, since earlier we saw that b = 25 cot(73°), so slope of BC is 25/b = 25/(25 cot(73°)) = tan(73°), which is consistent.

Now, Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), so its slope is -1/m_slope_of_BC = -1/tan(73°) ≈ -0.3057. Let me verify:

Slope of BC is tan(73°) ≈ 3.2709, so slope of AD is -1/3.2709 ≈ -0.3057.

Now, Line(A,D) passes through A(-13.8575, 25) and has slope -0.3057. Equation of Line(A,D) is:

y - 25 = m(x - a_x), where a_x = -13.8575.

So y = -0.3057(x + 13.8575) + 25.

Now, D lies on Line(B,C). Let me parametrize Line(B,C). As before, parametric equations for Line(B,C): from B(7.6425, 25) to C(0,0). Let me represent Line(B,C) parametrically as:

x = 7.6425 - 7.6425 * t

y = 25 - 25t

where t ∈ [0,1] gives the segment BC, and t > 1 extends beyond C.

But since D is the intersection of Line(A,D) and Line(B,C), we can find t such that the point (x(t), y(t)) lies on Line(A,D).

Substitute x(t) and y(t) into the equation of Line(A,D):

y(t) = -0.3057(x(t) + 13.8575) + 25

Plug in x(t) = 7.6425 - 7.6425t and y(t) = 25 - 25t:

25 - 25t = -0.3057(7.6425 - 7.6425t + 13.8575) + 25

Simplify inside the parenthesis:

7.6425 - 7.6425t + 13.8575 = (7.6425 + 13.8575) - 7.6425t = 21.5 - 7.6425t

So:

25 - 25t = -0.3057*(21.5 - 7.6425t) + 25

Subtract 25 from both sides:

-25t = -0.3057*(21.5 - 7.6425t)

Divide both sides by -1:

25t = 0.3057*(21.5 - 7.6425t)

Calculate RHS:

First compute 0.3057 * 21.5 ≈ 0.3057 * 21.5 ≈ Let me compute 0.3 * 21.5 = 6.45, 0.0057*21.5 ≈ 0.12255 → total ≈ 6.45 + 0.12255 ≈ 6.57255

Next term: 0.3057 * 7.6425t ≈ Let me approximate 0.3057 * 7.6425 ≈ 0.3057 * 7.6425 ≈ Let me compute 0.3 * 7.6425 = 2.29275, plus 0.0057*7.6425 ≈ 0.0436 → total ≈ 2.29275 + 0.0436 ≈ 2.33635. So RHS ≈ 6.57255 - 2.33635t.

So equation becomes:

25t = 6.57255 - 2.33635t

Bring all terms to left:

25t + 2.33635t - 6.57255 = 0 → 27.33635t = 6.57255 → t ≈ 6.57255 / 27.33635 ≈ Let me compute that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 27.33635: ≈ 6.57255 / 27.33635 ≈ approx 0.2404.

So t ≈ 0.2404.

Therefore, coordinates of D are:

x(t) = 7.6425 - 7.6425 * t ≈ 7.6425 * (1 - t) ≈ 7.6425 * (1 - 0.2404) ≈ 7.6425 * 0.7596 ≈ Let me calculate:

7.6425 * 0.75 = 5.731875, 7.6425 * 0.0096 ≈ ~0.0734. Total ≈ 5.731875 + 0.0734 ≈ 5.8053.

Similarly, y(t) = 25 - 25t ≈ 25 - 25 * 0.2404 ≈ 25 - 6.01 ≈ 18.99.

So approximate coordinates of D are (≈5.8053, ≈18.99).

Now, need to find BD. Point B is at (b,25) ≈ (7.6425, 25). Point D is at (≈5.8053, ≈18.99). Compute distance between B and D.

Using distance formula:

BD = sqrt[(7.6425 - 5.8053)^2 + (25 - 18.99)^2]

Compute differences:

Δx = 7.6425 - 5.8053 ≈ 1.8372

Δy = 25 - 18.99 = 6.01

Therefore,

BD ≈ sqrt( (1.8372)^2 + (6.01)^2 )

Calculate squares:

(1.8372)^2 ≈ 3.375

(6.01)^2 ≈ 36.1201

Total under sqrt ≈ 3.375 + 36.1201 ≈ 39.4951

Square root of that ≈ √39.4951 ≈ 6.284

But let me check with more precise numbers.

Wait, but these approximated values may introduce errors. Perhaps there is a better way to calculate BD analytically instead of numerically.

Let me revisit the analytical approach. Since we have expressions for a and b in terms of cotangents, perhaps we can find BD without plugging in numerical values.

Recall that D lies on Line(B,C), and we found earlier that s = (ab - b²)/(625 + b²). Wait, earlier derivation gave us s = (ab - b²)/(625 + b²). Wait, no, previously we had:

s = (ab - b²)/(625 + b²). Wait, let me recall:

Earlier, after cross-multiplying and simplifying, we had:

s = (ab - b²)/(625 + b²)

Wait, but this was derived under the assumption that Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(B,C). So with this s, we can find coordinates of D.

Coordinates of D on Line(B,C):

Parametric equations for Line(B,C): starting at B(b,25) and moving towards C(0,0). So coordinates of D can be written as:

D_x = b - s*b = b(1 - s)

D_y = 25 - s*25

But we also have that D lies on Line(A,D), which has slope -b/25.

Alternatively, since we have expressions for a and b, maybe we can find BD in terms of a and b.

But BD is the distance between B(b,25) and D. Let me find coordinates of D.

Alternatively, since D lies on Line(B,C), which can be parametrized as:

Any point on Line(B,C) can be expressed as B + t*(C - B) = (b,25) + t*(-b, -25) = (b - bt, 25 - 25t). So D is (b(1 - t), 25(1 - t)) for some t.

Now, since Line(A,D) is perpendicular to Line(B,C), and passes through A(a,25) and D(b(1-t), 25(1 - t)). The slope of Line(A,D) is [25(1 - t) - 25]/[b(1 - t) - a] = [-25t]/[b(1 - t) - a].

This slope must be equal to -b/25. So:

[-25t]/[b(1 - t) - a] = -b/25

Multiply both sides by denominator:

-25t = -b/25 * [b(1 - t) - a]

Multiply both sides by 25:

-25*25 t = -b [b(1 - t) - a]

=> -625t = -b²(1 - t) + ab

Rearranged:

-625t = -b² + b² t + ab

Bring all terms to left:

-625t - b² t + b² - ab = 0

Factor t:

t(-625 - b²) + (b² - ab) = 0

Solve for t:

t = (ab - b²) / (625 + b²)

So t = b(a - b) / (625 + b²)

Now, coordinates of D are:

D_x = b(1 - t) = b - b*t = b - b*[b(a - b)/(625 + b²)] = b[1 - b(a - b)/(625 + b²)]

Similarly, D_y = 25(1 - t) = 25 - 25t = 25 - 25*[b(a - b)/(625 + b²)]

Now, BD is the distance between B(b,25) and D(D_x, D_y).

Let me compute BD squared:

BD² = (D_x - b)^2 + (D_y - 25)^2

= [b(1 - t) - b]^2 + [25(1 - t) - 25]^2

= [ -b t ]^2 + [ -25t ]^2 

= b² t² + 625 t² 

= t² (b² + 625)

Therefore, BD = t * sqrt(b² + 625)

But we have t = b(a - b)/(625 + b²). Therefore:

BD = [b(a - b)/(625 + b²)] * sqrt(b² + 625) = [b(a - b)/sqrt(b² + 625)]

Thus, BD = [b(a - b)] / sqrt(b² + 625)

Now, substitute a and b in terms of cotangents.

Recall that:

a = -25 cot(61°)

b = 25 cot(73°)

Therefore, a - b = -25 cot(61°) - 25 cot(73°) = -25[cot(61°) + cot(73°)]

And sqrt(b² + 625) = sqrt{(25 cot(73°))² + 25²} = 25 sqrt(cot²(73°) + 1) = 25 csc(73°), since 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ.

Therefore:

BD = [b(a - b)] / sqrt(b² + 625) = [25 cot(73°) * (-25)[cot(61°) + cot(73°)] ] / [25 csc(73°) ]

Simplify:

The 25 in numerator and denominator cancels:

= [25 cot(73°) * (-25)[cot(61°) + cot(73°)] ] / [25 csc(73°) ] 

Wait, more carefully:

Numerator: b(a - b) = 25 cot(73°) * (-25)[cot(61°) + cot(73°)] 

Denominator: sqrt(b² + 625) = 25 csc(73°)

So overall:

BD = [25 cot(73°) * (-25)(cot(61°) + cot(73°))] / [25 csc(73°) ] 

Cancel 25 in numerator and denominator:

= [cot(73°) * (-25)(cot(61°) + cot(73°))] / [csc(73°) ]

Note that cot(θ)/csc(θ) = cos(θ), since cscθ = 1/sinθ and cotθ = cos
