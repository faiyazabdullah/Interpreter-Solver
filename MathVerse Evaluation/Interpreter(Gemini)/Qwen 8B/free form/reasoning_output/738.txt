QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the solid is constructed by a cone and semi-sphere. The radius of the cone is 3cm and its height is 12cm. Find the volume of the composite figure shown, correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the volume of a composite figure made up of a cone and a hemisphere. Let me start by recalling the given information. 

First, the problem mentions a cone and a hemisphere. The radius of the cone is 3 cm, and its height is 12 cm. Also, there's a relationship that the hemisphere shares the same radius as the cone's base, which is 3 cm. 

Let me break down the problem. The volume of the composite figure would be the sum of the volumes of the cone and the hemisphere. Wait, but wait—is the hemisphere attached to the cone? Like, maybe the flat face of the hemisphere is joined to the base of the cone? That would make sense because the hemisphere is mentioned as being connected to the cone. So the total volume should be Volume of Cone plus Volume of Hemisphere.

But let me confirm if there's any subtraction involved. If the hemisphere were somehow inside the cone, but no—the description says it's constructed by a cone and a semi-sphere. So probably they're combined such that the hemisphere is attached to the cone's base. So adding their volumes.

Now, I need to recall the formula for the volume of a cone and a hemisphere. 

The volume of a cone is (1/3)πr²h. Here, r is 3 cm and h is 12 cm. 

For the hemisphere, since it's half a sphere, the volume would be (1/2)*(4/3)πr³. Which simplifies to (2/3)πr³. Since the hemisphere has the same radius as the cone, which is 3 cm. 

So first calculate the cone's volume. Let me compute that. 

Cone Volume = (1/3) * π * (3)^2 * 12. Let me compute that step by step. 3 squared is 9, multiplied by 12 gives 108. Then multiply by 1/3: 108 / 3 = 36. So the cone's volume is 36π cm³.

Then the hemisphere's volume. Let's do that. The radius is 3 cm. So (2/3)*π*(3)^3. 3 cubed is 27. Multiply by 2/3: 27*(2/3) = 18. So hemisphere volume is 18π cm³.

Adding them together: 36π + 18π = 54π cm³. Now, converting that to a numerical value. Since π ≈ 3.1416, 54*3.1416 equals... Let me compute that. 

Well, 54 * 3 = 162, 54 * 0.1416 ≈ 54 * 0.14 = 7.56 and 54 * 0.0016 ≈ 0.0864. Adding those gives approximately 7.56 + 0.0864 ≈ 7.6464. So total is approx 162 + 7.6464 = 169.6464 cm³. Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 169.65 cm³. But wait, let me check my calculation again. Maybe I should use more precise steps.

Alternatively, compute 54 * π directly. Let me use calculator-like steps. π ≈ 3.1415926536. So 54 * 3.1415926536. Let me compute 50*π = 157.079632679, and 4*π ≈ 12.566370614. Adding them gives 157.0796 + 12.5664 ≈ 169.646 cm³. So yes, rounding to two decimal places, it's 169.65 cm³. 

Wait, but hold on—does the hemisphere's volume include the flat circular face? Well, the hemisphere is a three-dimensional shape, so its volume is indeed (2/3)πr³. So combining both, the total volume is 54π, which numerically is approximately 169.65 cm³. Therefore, the answer should be 169.65 cm³.

But let me check once more if I didn't mix up anything. The problem states "semi-sphere"—so hemisphere. Yes, which is half a sphere. So volume is half of (4/3)πr³, hence 2/3 πr³. Correct. And the cone's volume is 1/3 πr²h. All good. 

Another thing: Are there any overlapping volumes that need to be subtracted? For example, if the hemisphere was attached such that part of it is inside the cone? But according to the problem statement, it's constructed by a cone and a semi-sphere. So likely they are joined at their bases, so the total volume is additive. Hence, adding them is correct. 

Therefore, the final answer should be 54π cm³, which is approximately 169.65 cm³ when rounded to two decimal places.
