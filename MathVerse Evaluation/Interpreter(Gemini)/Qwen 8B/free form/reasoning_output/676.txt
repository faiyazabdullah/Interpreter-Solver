QUESTION:
The solid shown is constructed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube. Find its surface area if the side length is 14.2 and the radius is half that.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we need to find the surface area of a solid that's made by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube. The cube has a side length of 14.2 units, and the radius of the sphere is half of that, so 7.1 units. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall how surface area works for composite shapes. When you cut out a part of one shape from another, the surface area isn't just the sum of the original surfaces because some parts might be removed or exposed. But wait, in this case, removing a quarter-sphere from the cube... Hmm. Let me think carefully.

The original cube has a surface area. Then, when we remove a quarter-sphere, we have to consider two things: the surface area lost from the cube where the sphere was removed, and the new surface area added by the spherical portion. Wait, but since it's a quarter-sphere, maybe not the entire surface? Or does the removal of the sphere add the inner surface?

Wait, no. If you take a cube and drill out a quarter-sphere, then the surface area would be the original cube's surface area minus the area where the sphere was removed (since that part is no longer there) plus the surface area of the newly exposed part of the sphere. However, since it's a quarter-sphere, maybe we need to calculate the surface area contribution accordingly.

But first, let me confirm the dimensions. The cube has side length 14.2. The radius of the sphere is half of that, which is 7.1. That means the diameter of the sphere is 14.2, which is exactly equal to the side length of the cube. So the sphere fits perfectly inside the cube? Wait, if the diameter is equal to the side length, then the sphere would touch the centers of each face of the cube. But since we're removing a quarter of the sphere, perhaps it's carved out such that the sphere's center is at the corner of the cube? Or maybe the sphere is positioned so that its radius is half the cube's edge, so the sphere is entirely within the cube?

Wait, the problem says "cutting out a quarter of a sphere". A full sphere would have volume (4/3)πr³, so a quarter of that would be (1/4)(4/3 π r³) = (1/3)πr³. But maybe the surface area consideration is different. However, the question is about surface area, not volume, so let's focus on that.

When you remove a quarter-sphere from the cube, the surface area changes in two ways: 

1. The original surface area of the cube loses the area where the sphere was removed. However, since the sphere is being carved out, the part of the cube's surface that was covered by the sphere's interior is subtracted. But actually, when you remove material from the cube, the surface area of the cube is reduced by the area of the hole where the sphere was taken out. But also, the inner surface of the sphere becomes part of the total surface area.

But here's the catch: a full sphere's surface area is 4πr². However, since we are removing only a quarter of the sphere, does that mean we're taking out a quarter of the sphere's surface area? Or is it a quarter of the sphere's volume? The wording says "cutting out a quarter of a sphere", which likely refers to volume, but when considering surface area, we need to see what part of the sphere's surface remains.

Alternatively, maybe it's a quarter-sphere in terms of the portion removed. For example, imagine cutting a sphere into four equal parts, like slicing it along the equator and then a meridian. But depending on how it's cut, the surface area contribution could vary. However, in typical problems, when you remove a portion of a sphere, the surface area added is the surface area of that portion. But since it's a quarter-sphere, the surface area contributed would be a quarter of the full sphere's surface area? Or maybe not, because when you remove a part of the sphere, the remaining structure has that part's surface area as an internal cavity, but if it's hollowed out, then the inner surface would contribute to the total surface area.

Wait, but in this case, the problem states that the solid is constructed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from the cube. So, the resulting solid has the original cube minus that quarter-sphere. Therefore, the surface area would consist of:

Original surface area of the cube minus the area of the part where the quarter-sphere was removed (because that part is no longer on the exterior), plus the surface area of the newly exposed part of the quarter-sphere.

However, the surface area of a quarter-sphere—wait, a sphere's surface area is 4πr². If you take a quarter of the sphere, does that refer to a quarter of the volume or a quarter of the surface area? This is ambiguous. However, typically, when something is "cut out" as a portion of a sphere, it's more about the volume. But the surface area of the removed part depends on how it's cut. For instance, if you take a quarter of the sphere in terms of volume, the surface area of that portion may not simply be a quarter of the total surface area.

But perhaps the problem assumes that the quarter-sphere is a hemisphere, but divided further? Wait, maybe the quarter-sphere is a quarter of a sphere in terms of the surface area? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the quarter refers to the portion that's removed. For example, if you have a cube and you remove a quarter of a sphere, meaning that the sphere is cut into quarters, but how?

Alternatively, maybe it's a quarter-sphere as in a spherical cap. Wait, but without more details, this is confusing. Maybe we need to make assumptions based on standard terminology. In many cases, when you remove a quarter of a sphere from a cube, it's often considered as a hemisphere, but since it's a quarter, perhaps it's a quarter of a hemisphere. Wait, but the problem says a quarter of a sphere, not a hemisphere.

Alternatively, think about the position. Suppose the sphere is centered at one corner of the cube. Then, if you remove a quarter of the sphere, maybe the sphere is intersecting three faces of the cube, and removing a quarter of it. But this is getting too vague.

Wait, but the problem gives us that the radius is half the side length. Since the cube's side length is 14.2, the radius is 7.1. So the sphere has diameter 14.2, same as the cube's edge. Therefore, the sphere would fit exactly in the cube if it were placed such that its center is at the center of the cube. However, if we are removing a quarter of the sphere, maybe it's positioned so that the sphere is attached to one corner, with the radius extending to the adjacent edges? For example, imagine a sphere whose center is at one corner of the cube, and the radius equals half the side length. Then, the sphere would extend halfway along each axis from that corner. But then, removing a quarter of the sphere would mean that only a portion is taken out.

But regardless of the positioning, the key point is that when you remove a portion of the sphere from the cube, the surface area calculation involves:

Original cube's surface area minus the area of the region where the sphere was removed (but since the sphere is hollowed out, that area is no longer present on the cube's surface). Additionally, the inner surface area of the removed sphere portion is added.

So, assuming that the sphere is entirely within the cube, and we remove a quarter of it, then the surface area of the resulting solid would be:

Surface area of cube - area of the part where the sphere was removed (from the cube's surface) + surface area of the inner curved surface of the removed sphere.

But to compute these, we need to know how much of the cube's surface is replaced by the sphere's surface.

But here's the problem: if the sphere is removed, the area where it was removed from the cube is no longer there. However, the sphere itself has a surface area that becomes exposed. However, since it's a quarter of the sphere, the surface area of the sphere that is exposed is the surface area of the quarter-sphere.

But again, the confusion arises about whether the quarter refers to volume or surface area. However, in the absence of specific information, perhaps we can assume that the quarter-sphere refers to a spherical section that is removed, and thus the surface area added is the surface area of that quarter-sphere.

But how do we compute the surface area of a quarter-sphere? Well, a full sphere's surface area is 4πr². If we remove a quarter of the sphere, then the surface area of the removed portion would depend on how it's cut. If it's a quarter of the sphere in terms of volume, then the surface area might not be straightforward. However, if it's a quarter of the sphere in terms of the surface area, then it would be (1/4)*4πr² = πr². But this seems arbitrary unless specified.

Alternatively, perhaps the quarter-sphere refers to a hemisphere divided into two parts, making a quarter of a hemisphere. Wait, but the problem says "a quarter of a sphere," not a hemisphere.

Wait, maybe the quarter-sphere is a spherical segment or a spherical sector. For example, a quarter of a sphere could be a portion formed by cutting the sphere with planes. For example, if you take a sphere and slice it with two perpendicular planes passing through its center, dividing it into eight octants. Taking one of those octants would be a quarter of the sphere. So, the surface area of that octant would include the outer surface of the sphere in that quadrant, and the flat circular surfaces where the cuts are made. However, in our case, since we are removing the quarter-sphere from the cube, maybe those flat surfaces are not part of the surface area anymore—they are internal.

But in the problem statement, it's mentioned that the solid is constructed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from the cube. So, the quarter-sphere is removed, leaving behind the rest of the cube. Thus, the surface area of the resulting solid would be the original cube's surface area minus the area of the part of the cube that was removed (which is where the quarter-sphere was taken out) plus the surface area of the newly exposed part of the quarter-sphere.

Assuming that the quarter-sphere is a spherical portion that is removed, and that when it's removed, the surface area of the quarter-sphere is added. But how much of the sphere's surface area is exposed?

If the quarter-sphere is a portion of the sphere that was originally internal to the cube, then removing it would expose the inner surface of that quarter-sphere. However, if the sphere is entirely within the cube, then the entire surface area of the quarter-sphere would become part of the external surface area. But if part of the sphere's surface was already against the cube's walls, then removing it would expose only the inner surface.

Wait, but if the sphere is entirely within the cube, then when you remove it, the entire surface of the sphere is exposed. However, since it's only a quarter of the sphere, the surface area added would be a quarter of the total sphere's surface area. But again, this depends on how the quarter is defined.

Alternatively, maybe the quarter-sphere is a hemisphere divided into two equal parts. For example, if you take a hemisphere and divide it into two quarters, but that complicates things further.

Given the ambiguity, but given that the problem provides the radius as half the side length of the cube, which is 7.1. Let me check if there's another way.

Let me try calculating the surface area step by step.

First, compute the surface area of the cube. The formula for the surface area of a cube is 6*(side length)^2. Given side length is 14.2, so:

SA_cube = 6*(14.2)^2.

Then, when we remove a quarter of a sphere from the cube, we need to adjust the surface area. The key is figuring out how much surface area is lost from the cube and gained from the sphere.

Assume that the sphere is entirely within the cube, so that when we remove it, we are creating a cavity. The surface area of the cube is reduced by the area of the part that was occupied by the sphere. But since the sphere is removed, the surface area of the cube is decreased by the area of the intersection between the sphere and the cube. However, this is complicated unless we know the exact position of the sphere.

But given that the radius is 7.1, which is half the side length, and the sphere's diameter is equal to the cube's side length. If the sphere is placed such that its center coincides with the center of the cube, then the sphere touches the centers of each face of the cube. However, removing a quarter of the sphere would imply that only a portion of the sphere is removed. But if the sphere is centered, then removing a quarter of it might mean removing a section that extends from the center towards one face. However, without knowing the exact orientation, this is still unclear.

Alternatively, suppose the sphere is positioned so that its center is at one corner of the cube. Then, the radius is 7.1, which would mean that the sphere extends 7.1 units from that corner along each axis. Since the cube has side length 14.2, the sphere would extend halfway along each edge from that corner. In this case, removing a quarter of the sphere would involve removing a portion of the sphere that is near that corner. 

In such a scenario, the surface area calculation would involve subtracting the area of the part of the cube's surface that was covered by the sphere and adding the surface area of the newly exposed part of the sphere. However, since the sphere is only partially embedded in the cube, the overlapping area is a bit tricky.

But perhaps there's a simpler way. Let's think about the surface area contributions:

Original surface area of the cube: 6*s².

After removing a quarter-sphere, we lose some surface area from the cube where the sphere was removed and gain the inner surface area of the sphere.

However, if the sphere is entirely within the cube, then the area lost from the cube is zero because the sphere is inside, so removing it doesn't affect the cube's exterior surface. Wait, but that can't be. Because if you remove a part of the cube, the surface area of the cube would decrease by the area of the hole, but also the inner surface of the hole would be added.

Wait, yes! If you imagine drilling a hole through the cube, the surface area of the cube decreases by the area of the hole's cross-section but increases by the lateral surface area of the hole. However, in this case, instead of a cylindrical hole, it's a spherical portion removed.

But the problem says it's a quarter-sphere, so the shape of the hole is a quarter of a sphere. Therefore, the surface area change would be:

Original SA of cube - area of the part of the cube's surface that was removed (which is zero, since the sphere is inside) + the surface area of the newly exposed part of the sphere.

Wait, but if the sphere is entirely within the cube, then removing it would leave a cavity. However, the surface area of the cube remains unchanged except for the part where the sphere was removed. Wait, no—the cube's surface area is only affected if the removal creates a new opening. But if the sphere is entirely within the cube, then removing it would create an indentation, but the surface area of the cube would decrease by the area of the indentation's base (if it's a flat hole) but increase by the inner surface area of the indentation.

But in this case, the indentation is a quarter-sphere, so the base of the indentation is not flat—it's curved. Therefore, the surface area of the cube is decreased by the area of the part that was previously internal (which is zero, since the sphere wasn't part of the cube's exterior) and increased by the inner surface area of the sphere. Wait, no—if the sphere is inside the cube, then the original surface area of the cube is unaffected. Removing the sphere would create an open cavity, so the surface area of the cube is reduced by the area of the hole's opening (but since it's a curved hole, the area removed from the cube's surface is zero, because the sphere was internal). Instead, the surface area of the cavity is added.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. Imagine you have a cube and you dig out a portion of it, creating a cavity. The surface area of the cube is the original surface area plus the surface area of the cavity. Because the act of digging out removes some of the cube's material but adds the inner surface of the cavity.

Therefore, in general, the total surface area after removal would be:

Original surface area of the cube + surface area of the cavity.

But in this case, the cavity is a quarter of a sphere. However, if the cavity is entirely within the cube, then the surface area of the cavity is the surface area of the quarter-sphere. However, if part of the sphere was touching the cube's surface before removal, then the surface area of the cavity would be less than the full surface area of the sphere.

But given that the radius is half the side length of the cube, and the sphere's diameter is equal to the side length, if the sphere is centered at the cube's center, then the entire sphere is inside the cube. Removing a quarter of the sphere would mean removing a portion of the sphere, and the surface area of that portion becomes exposed. However, the surface area of the quarter-sphere would be a quarter of the total surface area of the sphere.

Wait, but a full sphere's surface area is 4πr². A quarter of that would be πr². But if we remove a quarter of the sphere, then the surface area added would be πr². Therefore, the total surface area would be original cube SA + πr².

But let's verify this logic. If you remove a quarter of a sphere, then the amount of surface area added is the surface area of the quarter-sphere. Assuming that the quarter-sphere is entirely within the cube, and that none of its surface was previously exposed, then yes, the surface area would be original cube SA + surface area of the quarter-sphere.

But wait, the problem says "cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube." So, the surface area of the resulting solid is the surface area of the cube minus the area of the part of the cube that was removed (which, if the sphere was inside, would be zero) plus the surface area of the newly exposed part of the sphere. Hence, it's original SA + surface area of the quarter-sphere.

But let me think: if the sphere is entirely inside the cube, then removing it would leave a cavity. The original surface area of the cube is unchanged, because the sphere was inside. However, the cavity's inner surface area is added. So, the total surface area is original SA + surface area of the cavity.

Thus, the surface area of the resulting solid is SA_cube + SA_quarter_sphere.

Now, the quarter-sphere's surface area. What is the surface area of a quarter of a sphere? A full sphere has surface area 4πr². If it's a quarter of the sphere, then the surface area would be (1/4)*4πr² = πr². But wait, that assumes that the quarter-sphere is a portion of the surface. However, when you remove a quarter of the sphere, you're not just taking a quarter of the surface; you're taking a quarter of the volume. But the surface area of the removed portion depends on the shape.

Wait, but if the quarter-sphere is a portion of the sphere's surface, then the surface area would be πr². However, if the quarter-sphere refers to a spherical cap or a portion of the sphere's volume, then the surface area might differ.

For example, a spherical cap's surface area is 2πr h, where h is the height of the cap. But in this case, if the quarter-sphere refers to a specific type of cap, we need more information. However, given the lack of specifics, perhaps we need to make an assumption.

Alternatively, if the sphere is cut into four equal parts, each part having a surface area of πr², then the total surface area would be original SA + πr².

But given that the problem mentions "quarter of a sphere," and given that the radius is half the cube's side length, let's proceed with this assumption.

So, proceeding under the assumption that removing a quarter of the sphere contributes πr² to the surface area.

Therefore, the total surface area would be:

SA_total = SA_cube + πr².

But wait, let me verify once more. If you remove a quarter of the sphere, then the surface area of the sphere that's now exposed is the surface area of the quarter-sphere. But a full sphere's surface area is 4πr², so a quarter would be πr². Hence, adding that to the cube's original surface area.

But wait, in reality, when you remove a portion of the sphere, you are exposing that portion's surface. So, if the quarter-sphere is removed, the surface area added is the surface area of the quarter-sphere.

But here's a critical point: if the sphere is entirely within the cube, then removing it exposes the inner surface of the sphere. However, if part of the sphere was already touching the cube's surface, then the surface area of the removed portion would be less. But in this case, since the sphere is entirely within the cube (radius 7.1, cube side 14.2), then the entire sphere is inside the cube. Therefore, removing it would expose the entire surface area of the sphere. But since it's only a quarter of the sphere, then the surface area added is πr².

Wait, but if you remove a quarter of the sphere, then the surface area added is the surface area of that quarter. But if the quarter refers to a quarter of the volume, the surface area might not be directly proportional. For example, if you take a quarter of a sphere in terms of volume, the surface area would depend on how the volume is distributed.

This is getting too ambiguous. Perhaps the problem expects us to consider that removing a quarter of the sphere means that the surface area added is a quarter of the sphere's surface area, i.e., πr². Hence, the total surface area is SA_cube + πr².

Let me calculate that.

First, compute the cube's surface area:

SA_cube = 6 * s² = 6 * (14.2)^2.

Then, compute πr², where r = 7.1.

So, SA_total = 6*(14.2)^2 + π*(7.1)^2.

But wait, let me check with the given data. The problem says that LengthOf(side) = 14.2 and LengthOf(radius) = 7.1, with Div(LengthOf(side),2)=LengthOf(radius), which checks out.

But let me compute the numbers.

First, compute 14.2 squared:

14.2 * 14.2 = ?

Well, 14^2 = 196, 0.2^2 = 0.04, and cross term 2*14*0.2=5.6. So, (14 + 0.2)^2 = 14^2 + 2*14*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 196 + 5.6 + 0.04 = 201.64. So, 14.2² = 201.64.

Then, SA_cube = 6 * 201.64 = 1209.84.

Next, compute πr² where r = 7.1.

7.1 squared is 7.1 * 7.1. 7*7=49, 7*0.1=0.7, 0.1*7=0.7, 0.1*0.1=0.01. So, (7 + 0.1)^2 = 49 + 1.4 + 0.01 = 50.41. So, 7.1² = 50.41.

Multiply by π: π * 50.41 ≈ 3.1416 * 50.41 ≈ let's calculate that.

Approximate 50.41 * 3.1416:

First, 50 * 3.1416 = 157.08

Then, 0.41 * 3.1416 ≈ 1.288

Total ≈ 157.08 + 1.288 ≈ 158.368.

So, approximately 158.37.

Adding this to the cube's surface area: 1209.84 + 158.37 ≈ 1368.21.

But let me double-check if this approach is correct. Is the surface area of the quarter-sphere indeed πr²?

Alternatively, maybe the surface area of the quarter-sphere is different. For example, if it's a spherical cap, but since it's a quarter-sphere, perhaps the surface area is different.

Wait, if the quarter-sphere is a hemisphere, then its surface area would be 2πr². But a quarter of a sphere... Hmm. Another approach: think of the surface area of the sphere. A full sphere has 4πr². If you take a quarter of it, then depending on how it's divided, it could be a portion of the surface. But if it's a quarter of the sphere in terms of volume, then the surface area might not be straightforward.

But since the problem says "cutting out a quarter of a sphere," it's more likely referring to volume. If we take a quarter of the sphere's volume, then the surface area of the removed portion would depend on how the volume is shaped. However, without specific information about the shape of the removed portion, this is difficult.

But given that the problem provides the radius as half the side length, and the relationship between them, perhaps there's a standard interpretation. Let me consider that the quarter-sphere is a hemisphere. If it's a hemisphere, then its surface area is 2πr². But since it's a quarter of a sphere, maybe it's a quarter of a hemisphere, which would be (1/2)*(1/4)*4πr² = πr². Wait, that's the same as before.

Alternatively, if it's a quarter of the sphere in terms of the surface area, then it's πr². Either way, the surface area added would be πr².

But let me think differently. Suppose the sphere is cut into four equal parts, each part being a quarter-sphere. Each quarter-sphere would have a surface area of πr². But why? Because the total surface area of the sphere is 4πr², so each quarter would have πr². Hence, the surface area of the quarter-sphere is πr².

Therefore, assuming that, the total surface area would be SA_cube + πr².

Hence, substituting the numbers:

SA_cube = 6*(14.2)^2 = 6*201.64 = 1209.84

SA_quarter_sphere = π*(7.1)^2 ≈ 158.37

Total SA ≈ 1209.84 + 158.37 = 1368.21

But let me check if there's any other factor. For example, when you remove the quarter-sphere from the cube, does the surface area of the cube get reduced by the area where the sphere was attached? No, because the sphere was inside the cube. The original cube's surface area remains the same, and we add the inner surface area of the quarter-sphere. Hence, the total surface area is SA_cube + πr².

But wait, another thought: when you remove the quarter-sphere, the surface area of the cube might have some parts that were covered by the sphere. For instance, if the sphere was sitting on top of the cube, then removing it would uncover that area. But in this case, the sphere is entirely within the cube, so there is no overlap with the cube's surface. Hence, removing it doesn't affect the cube's surface area, and only the inner surface of the quarter-sphere is added.

Therefore, the calculation seems valid.

So, the final surface area is 6*(14.2)^2 + π*(7.1)^2.

Let me calculate this precisely.

First, compute 14.2 squared:

14.2 × 14.2 = (14 + 0.2)^2 = 14² + 2×14×0.2 + 0.2² = 196 + 5.6 + 0.04 = 201.64. Correct.

Multiply by 6: 201.64 × 6 = 1209.84.

Compute π × 7.1²: 7.1² = 50.41, so π × 50.41 ≈ 50.41 × π.

Using π ≈ 3.1416, 50.41 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Calculate 50 × 3.1416 = 157.08

Then, 0.41 × 3.1416 ≈ 1.288

So total ≈ 157.08 + 1.288 = 158.368

So total SA ≈ 1209.84 + 158.368 = 1368.208

Rounded to, say, two decimal places: 1368.21.

But the problem might expect an exact form in terms of π. Let me check if the question requires an exact value or a numerical approximation. The problem says "Find its surface area," and given that the input values are decimals, it's likely expecting a numerical answer. But sometimes, problems prefer symbolic expressions. However, since the inputs are decimal, it's safer to give a numerical value.

But let me re-express the exact value. The surface area is 6*(14.2)^2 + π*(7.1)^2. Since 14.2 is twice 7.1, so 14.2 = 2*7.1. Let me substitute that:

SA = 6*(2r)^2 + π*r² = 6*4r² + πr² = 24r² + πr² = r²(24 + π).

Substituting r = 7.1:

SA = (7.1)^2 * (24 + π).

Calculating this:

(7.1)^2 = 50.41

So SA = 50.41 * (24 + π)

But if they want a numerical value, then:

24 + π ≈ 24 + 3.1416 = 27.1416

So SA ≈ 50.41 * 27.1416

Let me compute this:

First, multiply 50 * 27.1416 = 1357.08

Then, 0.41 * 27.1416 ≈ 11.128

So total ≈ 1357.08 + 11.128 ≈ 1368.208, which matches the earlier result.

So the exact value is 50.41*(24 + π), and the approximate value is around 1368.21.

But let me check if there's another perspective. Suppose the quarter-sphere is not just a portion of the surface but includes the flat part where it was cut. For example, if you remove a quarter of the sphere, you might also have a flat surface where the cut was made. But in that case, the surface area would include both the curved part and the flat part. However, the problem says "cutting out a quarter of a sphere," which suggests that the quarter-sphere is a portion of the sphere, not including any flat surfaces. So the flat surfaces would be internal and not counted in the surface area of the resulting solid.

But if the quarter-sphere is removed, and it had flat surfaces where it was cut, those would be internal and not contribute to the surface area. Therefore, only the curved surface area of the quarter-sphere is added. Hence, the previous calculation holds.

Another possibility: if the quarter-sphere is a hemisphere, then the surface area would be 2πr². But since it's a quarter-sphere, maybe it's a quarter of a hemisphere, which would be (1/2) * 2πr² = πr². Same result as before. So either way, πr².

Therefore, the final answer is SA = 6*(14.2)^2 + π*(7.1)^2, which numerically evaluates to approximately 1368.21 square units.

But let me check if there's any mistake in assuming that the entire surface area of the quarter-sphere is added. Suppose the quarter-sphere is removed, and the surface area added is just the outer part of the sphere, excluding the part that was connected to the cube. But since the sphere is fully inside the cube, all of its surface area is newly exposed. Hence, the entire surface area of the quarter-sphere is added.

Yes, that makes sense. So the calculation is correct.

Thus, the surface area is 6*(14.2)^2 + π*(7.1)^2. Plugging in the numbers:

As computed, this is approximately 1368.21.

But let me check if the problem expects an exact value in terms of π. For example, if they want an exact answer, it would be expressed as 6*(14.2)^2 + π*(7.1)^2, but since 14.2 and 7.1 are decimal numbers, it's more practical to present the numerical value.

Alternatively, since 14.2 is twice 7.1, as given by Div(LengthOf(side),2)=LengthOf(radius), we can write:

Let me express everything in terms of r. Since side length s = 2r.

SA_cube = 6s² = 6*(2r)^2 = 24r².

SA_quarter_sphere = πr².

Total SA = 24r² + πr² = r²(24 + π).

With r = 7.1, so SA = (7.1)^2 * (24 + π).

Which is the exact expression. Depending on what's required, but since the problem gives decimal values, probably wants a numerical answer.

So, computing (7.1)^2 = 50.41.

Then 24 + π ≈ 24 + 3.1416 = 27.1416.

Multiplying 50.41 * 27.1416 ≈ ?

Let me perform precise multiplication:

First, note that 50.41 * 27.1416 = ?

Breakdown:

50 * 27.1416 = 1357.08

0.41 * 27.1416 = ?

Calculate 0.4 * 27.1416 = 10.85664

0.01 * 27.1416 = 0.271416

Total = 10.85664 + 0.271416 = 11.128056

Total SA ≈ 1357.08 + 11.128056 ≈ 1368.208056.

So approximately 1368.21.

But the problem might require rounding to certain decimal places. Since the given values are to one decimal place (14.2 and 7.1), but the computation involved squaring them, leading to more decimals. It's common to round to two decimal places for such answers, so 1368.21.

But let me check if there's another error. For instance, did I account for all the surface area correctly?

Suppose the quarter-sphere is removed, and the surface area added is πr². But maybe it's not the entire surface area of the quarter-sphere, because part of it was in contact with the cube. But since the sphere is entirely within the cube, none of its surface was in contact with the cube. Hence, all of its surface area is exposed.

Therefore, the calculation is correct.

Thus, the final answer is approximately 1368.21.

But to ensure accuracy, let me use more precise π value.

Let me use π ≈ 3.1415926536.

So, 24 + π ≈ 27.1415926536.

Multiply by 50.41:

50.41 × 27.1415926536.

Let me calculate this more accurately.

First, 50 × 27.1415926536 = 1357.07963268

Then, 0.41 × 27.1415926536.

Compute 0.4 × 27.1415926536 = 10.8566370614

Compute 0.01 × 27.1415926536 = 0.2714159265

Add them together: 10.8566370614 + 0.2714159265 = 11.1280529879

Total SA ≈ 1357.07963268 + 11.1280529879 ≈ 1368.20768567.

So approximately 1368.2077, which rounds to 1368.21.

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 1368.21.

But let me check if there's any alternative approach. For example, someone might argue that when you remove the quarter-sphere, you also have to subtract the area where the sphere was attached to the cube, but since the sphere was inside, there is no attachment. Hence, no subtraction.

Alternatively, if the quarter-sphere was attached to the cube's surface, then removing it would subtract the area where it was attached. But in this case, the sphere is inside, so that's not the case.

Another possible mistake: thinking that the surface area of the quarter-sphere is 1/4 of the sphere's surface area, which is πr², but actually, if it's a quarter of the sphere in terms of volume, the surface area might be different. However, without specific information about the shape of the removed portion, this is the best assumption.

Therefore, I conclude that the surface area is approximately 1368.21.

But let me check with another method. Suppose the cube has a surface area of 6*(14.2)^2 = 6*201.64 = 1209.84.

The surface area of a full sphere is 4πr² = 4π*(7.1)^2 = 4π*50.41 = 201.64π.

A quarter of that would be 201.64π / 4 = 50.41π.

Wait, but this is different from earlier. Earlier, I assumed that the surface area of the quarter-sphere is πr², which is π*50.41, whereas this calculation shows that it's (4πr²)/4 = πr². Which is consistent. So, 50.41π is the surface area of the quarter-sphere.

But then, total surface area is 1209.84 + 50.41π.

But π is approximately 3.1416, so 50.41 * 3.1416 ≈ 158.37.

So total SA ≈ 1209.84 + 158.37 = 1368.21, which matches the prior result.

Thus, confirming the calculation.

So, the final answer is approximately 1368.21.

But since the problem may expect an exact value in terms of π, let's see:

If we keep it symbolic, the surface area is 6s² + πr². With s = 14.2 and r = 7.1.

Since s = 2r, this simplifies to 6*(4r²) + πr² = 24r² + πr² = r²(24 + π). Substituting r = 7.1, it's (7.1)^2*(24 + π). This is the exact expression.

But if the problem expects a numerical value, then it's approximately 1368.21.

But let me check with exact calculation using more precise π.

Using π ≈ 3.141592653589793,

50.41 * π = 50.41 * 3.141592653589793 ≈ let's calculate:

First, 50 * π = 157.07963267948966

Then, 0.41 * π ≈ 1.287225468875469

Summing: 157.07963267948966 + 1.287225468875469 ≈ 158.36685814836513

So total SA = 1209.84 + 158.36685814836513 ≈ 1368.2068581483651

Rounding to two decimal places: 1368.21.

Therefore, the final answer is approximately 1368.21.

Thus, the surface area is approximately 1368.21 square units.

But let me check if there's any other aspect I missed. For example, does removing the quarter-sphere affect the cube's surface area in any other way? Like, if the sphere was at a corner, then removing it might expose additional surfaces. But according to the problem, the sphere is cut out, but the description doesn't specify where. However, given that the radius is half the side length, it's likely that the sphere is centered at the cube's center, and removing a quarter of it would mean removing a portion that extends from the center towards one face, but the surface area calculation still holds as before.

Alternatively, if the sphere is at a corner, then removing a quarter-sphere would involve cutting it such that the surface area added is πr². Regardless of the position, as long as the entire sphere is within the cube, the surface area added is πr².

Hence, confident that the calculation is correct.

Final Answer: $1368.21$

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To determine the surface area of the solid formed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube, we analyze the situation in stages, starting with the given geometric configuration and applying known formulas and relationships.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Problem Setup

We are told:

- The solid is a **cube** with **side length** $ s = 14.2 $
- A **sphere** with **radius** $ r = \frac{s}{2} = 7.1 $
- A **quarter of the sphere** is **removed**, forming a cavity inside the cube
- We are asked to find the **total surface area** of the resulting solid

---

### Step 2: Break Down the Surface Area Components

#### a) Surface Area of the Cube

The surface area of a cube is given by:

$$
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{cube}} = 6s^2
$$

Plugging in $ s = 14.2 $:

$$
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{cube}} = 6 \times (14.2)^2 = 6 \times 201.64 = 1209.84
$$

#### b) Surface Area of the Removed Quarter-Sphere

A **full sphere** has a surface area of:

$$
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{sphere}} = 4\pi r^2
$$

Since we are removing **one-quarter** of the sphere, the **newly exposed surface area** due to the removal is:

$$
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{quarter-sphere}} = \frac{1}{4}(4\pi r^2) = \pi r^2
$$

Now plug in $ r
