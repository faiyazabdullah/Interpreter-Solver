<think>
Okay, so I need to find the total surface area of this solid that's made by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder. The radius is 15 cm, and the cylinder's height is 22 cm. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, let me recall the formulas for the surface areas of a cylinder and a hemisphere. But since we're removing a hemisphere from the cylinder, I have to consider which parts contribute to the total surface area.

Starting with the cylinder. Normally, the total surface area of a closed cylinder (with both top and bottom circles) is given by 2πr² + 2πrh. However, if we remove a hemisphere from it, I wonder if the hemisphere was attached to one of the ends? Wait, the problem says "removing a hemisphere from a cylinder," so maybe the hemisphere is taken out from one of the circular bases. That would mean that the original cylinder had a top and bottom circle, but after removing the hemisphere, one of those circles is replaced by the inner surface of the hemisphere?

Wait, actually, when you remove a hemisphere from the cylinder, imagine taking a hemisphere (which has a flat circular base and a curved surface) and subtracting it from the cylinder. So, if the hemisphere is removed from the cylinder, then the resulting solid would have:

- The outer surface area of the cylinder, except where the hemisphere was removed.
- Plus the inner surface area of the hemisphere (since we've removed it, the inside of the hemisphere becomes part of the surface).
- Also, there might be some adjustment because the flat face of the hemisphere was originally part of the cylinder's surface. If we remove the hemisphere, that flat face is no longer there, so we have to adjust accordingly.

Let me visualize this. Suppose the cylinder has radius r=15 cm and height h=22 cm. Let me assume that the hemisphere is removed from one of the circular ends. So, the original cylinder has two circular bases. If we remove a hemisphere from one of them, then the remaining structure would have:

- One circular base of the cylinder (the other end remains intact).
- The lateral surface area of the cylinder.
- The inner surface area of the hemisphere (which is half of the sphere's surface area).
- But wait, when you remove the hemisphere, the flat circular face of the hemisphere is now an opening. So, does that count as part of the surface area? Or do we just have the curved part?

Hold on, the question says "surface area of the solid". So when you remove the hemisphere, you are creating a new surface where the hemisphere used to be. So, the original cylinder had two circular faces. After removing the hemisphere, one of those circular faces is gone, but instead, we have the inner surface of the hemisphere. However, the hemisphere itself has two surfaces: the curved part and the flat base. But since we're removing the hemisphere, the flat base is now exposed. Wait, no—if the hemisphere is removed from the cylinder, then the flat base of the hemisphere was originally part of the cylinder's surface. Removing it would take away that part of the cylinder's surface and replace it with the curved surface of the hemisphere. Wait, no—actually, if you remove a hemisphere, you are taking away material from the cylinder. So suppose the cylinder has a hemispherical indentation. Then, the surface area would include:

- The outside of the cylinder, minus the area where the hemisphere was removed. But since the hemisphere is indented into the cylinder, the outside surface isn't affected. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the hemisphere is entirely within the cylinder. For example, if the cylinder is standing upright, and you cut off a hemisphere from its top. So, imagine the cylinder with a hemisphere attached to the top, but here it's the opposite—we remove the hemisphere from the cylinder. So, the original cylinder has a top circular face. We remove a hemisphere whose base is that circular face. Therefore, the resulting solid would have:

- The lateral surface area of the cylinder.
- The remaining part of the original top circular face? No, because if we remove the hemisphere, the top face is replaced by the inner surface of the hemisphere. Wait, if the hemisphere is removed, meaning that the hemisphere was part of the cylinder. Let me try to break it down.

Original cylinder: surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh. But if we remove a hemisphere from one of the circular ends, then:

- The original cylinder had two circular ends. Let's say we remove the hemisphere from the top. Then, the top circular end is replaced by the inner surface of the hemisphere. However, the hemisphere's flat face was originally part of the cylinder's top. Removing it means that the flat face is no longer present, and instead, the curved surface of the hemisphere is added. Additionally, the rest of the cylinder's surfaces remain.

So the total surface area would be:

- The lateral surface area of the cylinder: 2πr*h
- The area of the bottom circular base of the cylinder: πr²
- The curved surface area of the hemisphere: 2πr² / 2 = πr² (since the surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so hemisphere is half that, but since we only have the curved part, not including the base. Wait, hold on. A hemisphere has two types of surface areas: the curved surface and the flat circular base. If we remove the hemisphere, then the flat base was part of the original cylinder's surface. By removing the hemisphere, we take away the flat base (so we don't count it anymore) and add the curved surface of the hemisphere. Wait, but the hemisphere's curved surface is now part of the exterior of the solid. Therefore, the total surface area would be:

Original cylinder's surface area minus the area of the top circular base (since we removed it) plus the curved surface area of the hemisphere.

But let me check that logic again. Original cylinder has two circular ends. If we remove a hemisphere from one end, then that end is replaced by the curved surface of the hemisphere. So the total surface area would be:

- The lateral surface area of the cylinder: 2πrh
- The area of the bottom circular base: πr²
- The curved surface area of the hemisphere: 2πr²/2 = πr² (since the surface area of a full sphere is 4πr², so hemisphere is 2πr², but since we are considering only the curved part, not including the flat base. Wait, the hemisphere's surface area includes the curved part and the flat base. But if we remove the hemisphere, then the flat base is now an internal surface? Or is it external?

Actually, if you remove the hemisphere, you are taking away material from the cylinder. So imagine cutting out a hemisphere from the cylinder. So the original surface area of the cylinder would lose the area where the hemisphere was removed. But also, the removal adds the inner surface of the hemisphere. Wait, but depending on whether the hemisphere is hollowed out or not. Since it's a solid, removing the hemisphere would create a cavity. Hence, the surface area would consist of:

- The original outer surface of the cylinder, excluding the area where the hemisphere was removed.
- The inner surface of the hemisphere (curved part).
- The inner surface of the hemisphere's flat base, which is now an open surface.

Wait, no—the flat base of the hemisphere was originally part of the cylinder's surface. When we remove the hemisphere, that flat base is no longer there, so we have to account for the fact that the cylinder's surface loses that area, but the hemisphere's curved surface is added. However, the flat base of the hemisphere is now an opening, so does that count as part of the surface area? It depends on whether the problem considers the interior surfaces. 

But typically, when calculating surface area of such composite solids, we consider all exposed surfaces. So if you remove a hemisphere from the cylinder, then:

- The original cylinder had a top circular face. Removing the hemisphere takes away that face and replaces it with the curved surface of the hemisphere. Additionally, the flat circular base of the hemisphere (which was part of the cylinder's top) is now an opening. However, in terms of surface area, the flat base of the hemisphere is now an internal void, so it's not counted. Wait, but if the hemisphere is removed, the flat base is now an edge where the hemisphere was removed. Wait, no—if you imagine the hemisphere being removed, like drilling out a hemisphere from the cylinder. So, the surface area would include:

- The outer surface of the cylinder (excluding the area where the hemisphere was drilled out).
- The inner surface of the hemisphere (curved part).
- The original bottom surface of the cylinder (since we didn't remove anything from there).

But also, when you drill out the hemisphere, the flat circular base of the hemisphere is now an opening, so that's not part of the surface area. Wait, but the hole created by the hemisphere removal would have an inner surface. Wait, no—if the hemisphere is removed, the flat base of the hemisphere was once part of the cylinder. When you remove it, you're leaving a hole that goes through the cylinder. Wait, no, the hemisphere is attached to the cylinder. For instance, if you have a cylinder and you remove a hemisphere from one end, then the resulting shape would have:

- The outer cylindrical surface.
- The bottom circular base of the cylinder.
- The curved surface of the hemisphere (since the hemisphere was removed, but the rest of the cylinder is still there).
- And the flat circular base of the hemisphere is now an opening. But since that's an opening, it's not considered part of the surface area? Or is it?

This is getting confusing. Maybe I should refer back to standard problems. In similar problems, when you have a cylinder with a hemisphere removed, the total surface area is calculated as follows:

Total SA = (Lateral SA of cylinder) + (SA of the hemisphere's curved surface) + (Area of the remaining circular base of the cylinder)

Because when you remove the hemisphere, you are taking away the area of the circular base of the hemisphere (which was part of the cylinder's top) and adding the curved surface of the hemisphere. However, if the hemisphere is removed, then the flat circular base of the hemisphere is now an internal surface? Or is it considered as part of the surface area?

Wait, another way: think of the original cylinder. Its surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh. Now, if we remove a hemisphere from one end, we are effectively doing two things:

1. Removing the area of the circular base where the hemisphere was attached. So subtract πr² from the original surface area.
2. Adding the curved surface area of the hemisphere, which is 2πr²/2 = πr². Because the hemisphere's curved surface is now exposed.

Therefore, the total surface area would be:

Original SA - πr² (for the removed base) + πr² (for the hemisphere's curved surface) = same as original SA. But that can't be right, because the original SA included the top and bottom. If we remove the top, then the total SA would be (original SA) - πr² (top) + πr2 (hemisphere curved surface) = original SA. Which suggests that the total surface area remains the same. But that seems counterintuitive. There must be something wrong here.

Wait, but if you remove the hemisphere, you are also changing the shape. For example, if the hemisphere is removed, then the original top of the cylinder is gone, and replaced by the curved surface of the hemisphere. But the flat base of the hemisphere is now an opening. However, in terms of surface area, the flat base of the hemisphere is not part of the exterior anymore—it's just a hole. So that area is not included. Therefore, the correct calculation would be:

Original surface area of the cylinder minus the area of the top base (since it's removed) plus the curved surface area of the hemisphere. Therefore:

Total SA = (2πr² + 2πrh) - πr² + (2πr²)/2 ?

Wait, let me clarify:

The surface area of a hemisphere (only the curved part) is 2πr². Wait, no. The entire surface area of a sphere is 4πr², so a hemisphere's curved surface is half of that, which is 2πr². But if we are talking about the surface area of the hemisphere, including the flat circular base, then it would be 3πr² (2πr² for the curved part plus πr² for the flat base). But in our case, when we remove the hemisphere from the cylinder, the flat base of the hemisphere was part of the cylinder's original surface. So removing the hemisphere removes that flat base from the cylinder's surface and adds the curved surface of the hemisphere. Thus, the net change would be (-πr²) + (2πr²) = πr². Therefore, the total surface area would be original surface area of the cylinder plus πr².

But original surface area of the cylinder is 2πr² + 2πrh. So total SA becomes:

(2πr² + 2πrh) + πr² = 3πr² + 2πrh.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify with an example. Suppose the cylinder has radius r and height h. Remove a hemisphere from one end. Then the surface area should be:

- The lateral surface area of the cylinder: 2πrh
- The area of the bottom base: πr²
- The curved surface area of the hemisphere: 2πr²

Thus, total SA = 2πrh + πr² + 2πr² = 2πrh + 3πr².

Yes, that matches the previous result. So that formula makes sense.

Alternatively, if you think of the original cylinder having two circular bases. After removing the hemisphere, one of those bases is gone, and instead, we have the curved surface of the hemisphere. So the total number of circular bases is reduced by one, but we add the curved surface of the hemisphere. Therefore, the surface area is:

Original SA (2πr² + 2πrh) minus πr² (one base) plus 2πr² (curved surface of hemisphere) equals 2πr² + 2πrh - πr² + 2πr² = 3πr² + 2πrh.

So yes, that's the formula.

Now, applying this to the given values. The radius r is 15 cm, height h is 22 cm.

Compute each term:

First, compute 2πrh:

2 * π * 15 * 22

Then compute 3πr²:

3 * π * 15²

Adding these together gives the total surface area.

Let me calculate each part numerically.

First, compute 2πrh:

2 * π * 15 * 22.

Calculate 2*15 = 30, 30*22 = 660. So 660π.

Then compute 3πr²:

3 * π * 15² = 3 * π * 225 = 675π.

So total SA is 660π + 675π = 1335π.

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me check again.

Wait, original cylinder surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh. Then subtract πr² (the top base) and add 2πr² (curved surface of hemisphere). So total SA = (2πr² + 2πrh) - πr² + 2πr² = 3πr² + 2πrh. Yes, that's correct.

So plugging numbers:

3π*(15)^2 + 2π*(15)*(22) = 3π*225 + 2π*330 = 675π + 660π = 1335π cm².

But the problem says to give the answer to two decimal places. So I need to compute 1335π numerically.

π ≈ 3.14159265...

Calculating 1335 * π:

First, approximate value:

1335 * 3.1416 ≈ ?

Well, let's compute 1335 × π.

Alternatively, note that π ≈ 3.1416, so:

Multiply 1335 × 3.1416.

Breakdown:

First, 1000 × 3.1416 = 3141.6

300 × 3.1416 = 942.48

35 × 3.1416 = let's compute:

35 × 3 = 105, 35 × 0.1416 = approx 35 × 0.14 = 4.9, 35 × 0.0016 = 0.056 → total ≈ 4.9 + 0.056 = 4.956. So total for 35×π≈105 + 4.956 = 109.956.

So total ≈ 3141.6 + 942.48 = 4084.08 + 109.956 ≈ 4194.036.

So approximately 4194.04 cm².

Wait, but let me check with calculator steps:

Alternatively, use calculator-like computation:

π ≈ 3.14159265

1335 × π ≈ 1335 × 3.14159265

Let me compute 1335 × 3.14159265:

We can write 1335 × π ≈ 1335 × 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1335 × 3.14159265:

First, multiply 1335 × 3 = 4005

Then 1335 × 0.14159265 ≈ ?

Compute 1335 × 0.1 = 133.5

1335 × 0.04 = 53.4

1335 × 0.00159265 ≈ ?

Approximate 1335 × 0.0016 ≈ 2.136

So adding up:

0.1 + 0.04 + 0.00159265 ≈ 0.14159265

So total approximation:

133.5 + 53.4 = 186.9 + 2.136 ≈ 189.036

So total π × 1335 ≈ 4005 + 189.036 = 4194.036 cm²

Which rounds to 4194.04 cm² when rounded to two decimal places.

But let me confirm with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use exact multiplication:

Let me compute 1335 × π:

Using calculator input, 1335 × π ≈ 1335 × 3.1415926535 ≈ ?

Well, using calculator steps:

Take π ≈ 3.1415926535

Multiply 1335 × 3.1415926535:

Let me do this step-by-step.

First, note that 1335 × π = π × 1335.

Alternatively, since I don't have a calculator here, but my earlier estimate is around 4194.04 cm².

But let me cross-validate with another method.

Alternatively, compute 1335 × π ≈ 1335 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1335 × 3 = 4005

1335 × 0.1416 = ?

First, 1335 × 0.1 = 133.5

1335 × 0.04 = 53.4

1335 × 0.0016 = 2.136

So total 133.5 + 53.4 = 186.9 + 2.136 = 189.036

So total is 4005 + 189.036 = 4194.036 cm².

So rounding to two decimal places is 4194.04 cm².

But let me check if my initial formula is correct. Another way to think about the surface area:

When you remove the hemisphere from the cylinder, the surface area consists of:

- The outer lateral surface area of the cylinder: 2πrh

- The area of the bottom base of the cylinder: πr²

- The curved surface area of the hemisphere: 2πr²

So total SA = 2πrh + πr² + 2πr² = 2πrh + 3πr².

Plugging in r = 15, h = 22:

2π*15*22 + 3π*15² = 660π + 675π = 1335π.

Yes, that's correct.

So converting 1335π into numerical value:

As above, 1335 × π ≈ 4194.04 cm².

But let me check if there's any mistake in the formula.

Another perspective: Imagine building the shape. The original cylinder has two circular ends. Removing a hemisphere from one end. The remaining surface area is:

- The outside of the cylinder (lateral surface): 2πrh

- The bottom circle: πr²

- The curved part of the hemisphere: 2πr²

Hence total SA = 2πrh + πr² + 2πr² = 2πrh + 3πr², which is what I had before.

Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is 1335π cm², which is approximately 4194.04 cm².

But let me check if there is an alternative interpretation. What if the hemisphere is removed such that the flat face is part of the surface area?

For example, if the hemisphere is removed, but the flat face is now an internal surface? No, usually in such problems, when you remove a shape, you consider the newly exposed surfaces. So the flat base of the hemisphere was previously part of the cylinder's surface, but now it's removed, so the surface area decreases by πr², but adds the curved surface area of the hemisphere (2πr²). So net gain of πr². Hence total SA is original SA + πr².

Original SA of cylinder is 2πr² + 2πrh. Adding πr² gives 3πr² + 2πrh, same as before.

Therefore, calculations are correct.

So the final answer is approximately 4194.04 cm².

But to make sure, let me compute 1335 × π with more accurate value of π.

π ≈ 3.141592653589793

Compute 1335 × π:

Let me compute 1335 × π:

First, 1335 × 3 = 4005

1335 × 0.141592653589793 ≈ ?

Compute 1335 × 0.1 = 133.5

1335 × 0.04 = 53.4

1335 × 0.001592653589793 ≈ ?

First, 0.00159265... is roughly 0.001592653589793 ≈ 1/628.3185... (since 1/628.3185 ≈ 0.0015915...)

But regardless, compute 1335 × 0.00159265 ≈ 1335 × 0.0016 = 2.136, but slightly less. Let me compute:

1335 × 0.001 = 1.335

1335 × 0.00059265 ≈ ?

First, 0.0005 × 1335 = 0.6675

Then, 0.00009265 × 1335 ≈ 0.00009265 × 1335 ≈ 0.1235.

So total ≈ 0.6675 + 0.1235 ≈ 0.791.

So total for 0.00159265 × 1335 ≈ 1.335 + 0.791 ≈ 2.126.

So total 1335 × 0.14159265 ≈ 133.5 + 53.4 + 2.126 ≈ 133.5 + 53.4 is 186.9 + 2.126 = 189.026.

Therefore, total SA ≈ 4005 + 189.026 = 4194.026 cm².

Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4194.03 cm². Wait, but earlier estimation was 4194.04. Depending on the exact value of π, it could vary slightly. Let me check with higher precision.

Alternatively, use calculator-like computation:

If I take π as 3.141592653589793

Compute 1335 × π:

Let me use the fact that 1335 × π = π × 1335.

Let me compute π × 1335:

Since π ≈ 3.141592653589793

Multiply 3.141592653589793 × 1335.

Let me perform the multiplication step by step:

Breakdown 1335 into 1300 + 35.

First compute 3.141592653589793 × 1300:

That is 3.141592653589793 × 1000 + 3.141592653589793 × 300

= 3141.592653589793 + 942.4777960769379 ≈ 3141.59265 + 942.477796 ≈ 4084.070446

Then compute 3.141592653589793 × 35:

Compute 3.141592653589793 × 30 = 94.24777960769379

Plus 3.141592653589793 × 5 = 15.707963267948965

Total ≈ 94.2477796 + 15.7079633 ≈ 109.9557429

Add this to the previous total:

4084.070446 + 109.9557429 ≈ 4194.0261889 cm².

So approximately 4194.026 cm². Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4194.03 cm².

But why did my prior estimation give 4194.04? It's due to the precision of π. Depending on how many decimals we carry, the value may vary slightly. However, the exact value is approximately 4194.03 cm².

But let me check with another approach. Let me use calculator-like computation for 1335 × π.

Alternatively, note that π ≈ 22/7, but that's an approximation. 22/7 is approximately 3.142857. Using that:

1335 × 22/7 = (1335 × 22)/7

Calculate numerator: 1335 × 22.

Well, 1335 × 20 = 26700, 1335 × 2 = 2670 → total 26700 + 2670 = 29370.

Divide by 7: 29370 ÷ 7 ≈ 4195.714 cm². But since π is approximately 3.1416 < 22/7 ≈ 3.1428, so actual value is less than 4195.71, so likely around 4194.03 cm².

Thus, the precise value is approximately 4194.03 cm² when rounded to two decimal places.

However, different sources might round differently based on more precise π values. For example, using π ≈ 3.141592653589793, the exact value is approximately 4194.026 cm², which rounds to 4194.03 cm².

But let me check with another method. Let me use known value of π multiplied by 1335.

If I use the value of π as 3.141592653589793:

Multiply 1335 × π:

Let me use a calculator here (pretending I'm using one):

1335 × π ≈ 1335 × 3.141592653589793 ≈ 4194.026 cm².

So, to two decimal places, it's 4194.03 cm².

But let me check if there is any error in the initial formula. Suppose someone argues that when you remove the hemisphere, you should also consider the flat circular base of the hemisphere as part of the surface area. But that doesn't seem right because it's an opening. Wait, but if the hemisphere is removed, then the flat base is now an opening, hence it's not part of the surface area. Hence, the formula is correct.

Alternatively, if the hemisphere were attached externally, but in this case, it's removed, so the flat face is not contributing.

Thus, the final answer is approximately 4194.03 cm².

But let me verify once again with the exact calculation:

Given that 1335 × π ≈ 4194.026 cm², so to two decimal places, it's 4194.03.

But sometimes, depending on the rounding rules, if the third decimal is 5 or more, you round up. Here, the value is approximately 4194.026..., which is 4194.03 when rounded to two decimal places.

Therefore, the final answer is 4194.03 cm².

But let me check if there is any chance that the problem expects the surface area to exclude the base of the hemisphere. Wait, no, because when you remove the hemisphere, you expose the curved surface. The flat base of the hemisphere was part of the original cylinder's surface. Removing it removes that area, and adds the curved surface. So the formula is correct.

Therefore, I think my conclusion is correct.

**Final Answer**
$\boxed{4194.03}$
</think>

To determine the **total surface area** of the solid formed by removing a **hemisphere** from a **cylinder**, we proceed by analyzing the geometric components involved and their respective contributions to the surface area.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Geometric Composition

- The **cylinder** has:
  - Two circular bases: top and bottom
  - A **lateral surface** (curved side)

- A **hemisphere** is removed from **one** of the circular bases — specifically, the **top** base.

Upon removal:
- The **flat circular base** of the hemisphere (originally part of the cylinder’s top) is **removed**, reducing the surface area by $ \pi r^2 $
- The **curved surface** of the hemisphere is now **exposed**, increasing the surface area by $ 2\pi r^2 $

---

### Step 2: Write Down the Formula for Total Surface Area

$$
\text{Total Surface Area} = 
(\text{Lateral Surface Area of Cylinder}) + (\text{Bottom Circular Base}) + (\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere})
$$

Substituting known formulas:

$$
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi rh \\
\text{Bottom Circular Base} = \pi r^2 \\
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2
$$

Thus,

$$
\text{Total Surface Area} = 2\pi rh + \pi r^2 + 2\pi r^2 = 2\pi rh + 3\pi r^2
$$

---

### Step 3: Plug in Given Values

We are given:
- Radius $ r = 15 $ cm
- Height $ h = 22 $ cm

Substitute into the formula:

$$
\text{Surface Area} = 2\pi(15)(22) + 3\pi(15)^2 = 660\pi + 675\pi = 1335\pi
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert to Decimal Form

Use $ \pi \approx 3.14159265 $:

$$
1335\pi \approx 1335 \times 3.14159265 \approx 4194.026
$$

Round to **two decimal places**:

$$
\text{Surface Area} \approx 4194.03 \text{ cm}^2
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{4194.03}
$$
