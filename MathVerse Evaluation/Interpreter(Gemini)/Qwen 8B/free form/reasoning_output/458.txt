MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the cosine of an angle θ whose terminal side passes through the point (-4, -6). Hmm, I remember that in trigonometry, when dealing with points on the coordinate plane and angles in standard position, we can use the coordinates to find trigonometric ratios. 

First, let me recall the definition of cosine in terms of the unit circle. If θ is an angle in standard position (vertex at the origin, initial side along the positive x-axis), then the cosine of θ is the x-coordinate divided by the radius (the distance from the origin to the point). But wait, the point here isn't necessarily on the unit circle. The point given is (-4, -6), so I need to calculate the radius first. 

Wait, the problem mentions a diagram with certain points and lines. Let me check the given predicates again. There are points O, A, B, P. Point O seems to be the origin since there's a line OB and other points lying on it. Also, point P is mentioned with coordinates (-4, -6). Additionally, there are some length relations: OA has length 4, AP has length 6, and OP is the hypotenuse of triangle OAP, which is a right triangle because angle OAP is a right angle. 

So maybe the triangle OAP is a right triangle with legs OA and AP, and hypotenuse OP. Since OA is 4 units, AP is 6 units, then OP should be sqrt(4² + 6²) = sqrt(16 + 36) = sqrt(52) = 2*sqrt(13). Wait, but the problem says that OP is the hypotenuse of triangle OAP. That makes sense because angle at A is a right angle, so the hypotenuse would be opposite the right angle, which is OP. 

But how does this relate to the angle θ? The terminal side of θ passes through point P, which is (-4, -6). So θ is the angle formed by the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to point P. Therefore, to find cosθ, I need to compute the x-coordinate of P divided by the distance from the origin to P. 

Let me verify. The coordinates of P are (-4, -6). The distance from O to P (which is the radius r) is sqrt[(-4)^2 + (-6)^2] = sqrt(16 + 36) = sqrt(52). Simplifying sqrt(52) gives 2*sqrt(13). Then cosθ is x/r, so (-4)/(2√13). This simplifies to (-2)/√13. However, the problem says to rationalize the denominator. To do that, multiply numerator and denominator by √13, resulting in (-2√13)/13. 

But wait, let me make sure that the triangle OAP being a right triangle doesn't affect this calculation. Because even though there's a right triangle involved, the coordinates of P are given directly. The problem states that the terminal side passes through P, so regardless of the triangle OAP, the standard formula applies. However, perhaps the given lengths OA=4 and AP=6 are meant to confirm that OP is indeed sqrt(52). Let me check that. 

OA is 4, AP is 6, and since they are perpendicular (as per the Perpendicular predicate), triangle OAP is a right triangle with legs 4 and 6. Therefore, hypotenuse OP is sqrt(4² + 6²) = sqrt(52), which matches the earlier calculation. So that confirms that the coordinates of P are consistent with these distances. 

Therefore, even though there's a triangle involved, the key is that point P lies on the terminal side of angle θ, so we can use its coordinates to find cosθ. Hence, cosθ = x/r = -4 / sqrt(52) = -2/sqrt(13) after simplifying, which rationalizes to -2√13 /13. 

I think that's the correct approach. Let me just double-check. Another way to see: since the coordinates are (-4, -6), the reference angle's cosine would involve those coordinates. Yes, the standard method is to divide x by the magnitude. So yes, the answer should be -2√13 over 13.
