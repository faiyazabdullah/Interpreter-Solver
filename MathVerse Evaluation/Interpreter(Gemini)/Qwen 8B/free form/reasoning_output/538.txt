QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5} \pi, 8\right)$ and again at $\left(\frac{7}{5} \pi, 8\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

Okay, so I need to find the period of a trigonometric function based on the given points where it intersects its midline. Let me start by recalling what I know about trigonometric functions and their graphs.

First, the midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line around which the function oscillates. For example, in a sine or cosine function of the form y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, the midline is y = D. The midline is also the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function. 

The problem states that the graph intersects its midline at two points: (3π/5, 8) and (7π/5, 8). Since these are points on the midline, they have the same y-coordinate, which is 8. That suggests that the midline equation is y = 8. So the vertical shift D in the standard form would be 8. But how does this relate to the period?

Now, the period of a trigonometric function refers to the length of one full cycle of the function. For the standard sine and cosine functions, the period is determined by the coefficient B in the equation y = A sin(Bx + C) + D. Specifically, the period is 2π divided by |B|. 

But how do the intersection points with the midline help us find the period? Well, if the function crosses the midline, that happens twice within each period. However, depending on the phase shift and whether it's a sine or cosine function, the number of times it crosses the midline per period can vary. Wait, actually, for a standard sine wave, it crosses the midline once going up and once going down in each half-period. Hmm, maybe I should think more carefully.

Let me consider the general behavior. If we have a sinusoidal function, it crosses the midline every half-period. Wait, no—if you think about a sine function starting at the origin, it crosses the midline at 0, π, 2π, etc., but that's not quite accurate. Actually, a sine function crosses the midline at points where the argument of the sine function is 0, π, 2π, etc. So, if we have a function like y = sin(Bx), it crosses the midline (y=0) at x = 0, π/B, 2π/B, etc. Each time it completes a full cycle, it crosses the midline twice—once when ascending and once when descending. Therefore, the distance between two consecutive midline crossings would be half the period? Or wait, let's take an example. Suppose the period is T. Then, over the interval [0, T], the function goes up and down once. So crossing the midline once while increasing and once while decreasing. So the time between two consecutive midline crossings would be half the period? No, because between two consecutive midline crossings, the function would go from midline up to peak, back to midline, then down to trough, then back to midline. Wait, no. Let me visualize.

Imagine a sine wave starting at the midline. At x=0, it's at midline. Then it goes up to max, back to midline at π/B, then down to min, then back to midline at 2π/B. So between x=0 and x=π/B, it goes from midline to max and back to midline—that's half a period. Then from π/B to 2π/B, it goes from max to min and back to midline—that's another half period. Therefore, the distance between two consecutive midline crossings (say, at x=0 and x=π/B) is half the period. Wait, but in our case, the two points given are (3π/5, 8) and (7π/5, 8). The difference in x-coordinates is 7π/5 - 3π/5 = 4π/5. If these two points are consecutive midline crossings, then that difference would be half the period. Therefore, the period would be twice that difference, which is 8π/5. But wait, let me confirm.

Alternatively, perhaps the two points given are two consecutive midline crossings. However, sometimes the midline could be crossed multiple times in a period. For example, in a standard sine curve, it crosses the midline infinitely many times. But since the function is periodic, the distance between two consecutive crossings would depend on the function's parameters.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says "intersects its midline at those two points". If the midline is horizontal, then the function crosses the midline at those points. Now, depending on the type of function (sine or cosine), the number of crossings per period varies. However, regardless of the type, the distance between two consecutive midline crossings is half the period. Because, for instance, in a sine wave, between two consecutive midline crossings, there's a half-period. Wait, earlier thought was that between x=0 and x=π/B, which is half the period, the function goes from midline to max and back to midline. Hence, the distance between two such crossings is half the period. Therefore, if the two given points are consecutive midline crossings, the difference in their x-values would be half the period. Thus, the period would be twice that difference.

So let's compute the difference between the x-coordinates: 7π/5 - 3π/5 = 4π/5. If this difference is half the period, then the full period would be 8π/5. However, I need to make sure that these two points are indeed consecutive midline crossings. But how can we be certain?

Another way to think: suppose the function has midline y=8. The midline crossings occur where the function equals 8. So, if we have two points where the function equals 8, and assuming that between them, the function reaches its maximum and minimum. So, the distance between these two points would correspond to half the period if they are consecutive crossings. Alternatively, if they are separated by a full period, then the difference would be the period. But how can we tell?

Alternatively, considering that the midline is horizontal, and the function is sinusoidal, so the graph repeats itself after the period. So, if the two points given are two instances where the function crosses the midline, the distance between them could be either half a period or a full period, depending on whether they are consecutive crossings or not.

However, in typical problems like this, unless specified otherwise, the two points given are usually consecutive midline crossings. For example, if you have a sine wave, it crosses the midline at regular intervals. So, if the function crosses the midline at x = a and x = b, and if these are consecutive crossings, then the difference between a and b is half the period. Therefore, the period would be 2*(b - a).

In our case, the two points are at x = 3π/5 and x = 7π/5. The difference is 4π/5. So if that's half the period, then the period would be 8π/5. But let me check with another approach.

Suppose the function is of the form y = A sin(Bx + C) + D. We know that the midline is y = D = 8. So D = 8. The midline crossings happen when y = 8, which implies A sin(Bx + C) + D = 8 → A sin(Bx + C) = 0 → sin(Bx + C) = 0. The solutions to sin(theta) = 0 are theta = nπ, where n is integer. Therefore, Bx + C = nπ. Solving for x gives x = (nπ - C)/B. 

Therefore, the x-values where the function crosses the midline are spaced by π/B. Because for consecutive integers n and n+1, the difference in x would be [( (n+1)π - C ) / B ] - [ (nπ - C ) / B ] = π/B. Therefore, the distance between consecutive midline crossings is π/B. 

But according to this, the distance between two consecutive midline crossings is π/B. However, the period T is 2π / B. Therefore, the distance between consecutive midline crossings is T/2. So, if the two points given are consecutive midline crossings, then the difference in their x-values is T/2. Therefore, T = 2*(difference in x-values).

In our problem, the difference between the x-values is 7π/5 - 3π/5 = 4π/5. So T = 2*(4π/5) = 8π/5. Therefore, the period is 8π/5.

Hence, the answer should be 8π/5.

Wait, but let me verify once again. Suppose the two points are consecutive crossings. Then yes, T/2 is the difference. Therefore, T is twice that. So the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, if the two points were not consecutive, but separated by some other number of crossings, the difference would be different. However, without additional information, we assume that these are consecutive crossings. Also, since the problem mentions that the graph intersects its midline at those two points, implying that they are two distinct points where the function crosses the midline. Given that the function is periodic, and the midline crossings are infinite, but the minimal distance between two consecutive ones would be T/2. Therefore, the answer should be 8π/5.

Thus, the period is 8π/5.
