QUESTION:
Consider the cube shown. Its length of side is $x+4$.

Find the polynomial that represents the volume of the cube.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the polynomial that represents the volume of a cube when its side length is given as x + 4. Let me start by recalling some basic geometry concepts related to cubes.

First, I know that a cube is a three-dimensional shape with all sides equal. Each face is a square, and all edges are the same length. The volume of a cube is calculated by cubing the length of one of its sides. The formula for volume (V) in terms of side length (s) is V = s³. 

Now, the problem states that the side length of the cube is x + 4. Let me note that down. So, if the side length is s = x + 4, then substituting into the volume formula should give me the polynomial. That would mean V = (x + 4)³. But wait, maybe I need to expand this expression to write it as a polynomial? Let me check the question again.

The question says, "Find the polynomial that represents the volume of the cube." Hmm. If they just want the expression in terms of x, then expanding (x + 4)³ would make sense. Alternatively, perhaps they consider (x + 4)³ itself as the polynomial, but usually, polynomials are expressed in standard form, so expanding it would be more appropriate. 

Let me think. Expanding (x + 4)³. To do that, I can use the binomial theorem or multiply it out step by step. Let me recall that (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. Applying that here with a = x and b = 4:

(x + 4)³ = x³ + 3x²*4 + 3x*(4)² + 4³  
Calculating each term:

First term: x³  
Second term: 3 * 4 = 12, so 12x²  
Third term: 3 * 16 = 48, so 48x  
Fourth term: 64  

So combining these, the expanded polynomial is x³ + 12x² + 48x + 64. 

Wait, let me verify that multiplication again. Maybe I should multiply step by step to ensure no mistakes. Starting with (x + 4)(x + 4) first, then multiplying by (x + 4) again.

First, compute (x + 4)(x + 4). That's x*x + x*4 + 4*x + 4*4 = x² + 4x + 4x + 16 = x² + 8x + 16. Then multiply this quadratic by (x + 4):

Multiply x² + 8x + 16 by x: x³ + 8x² + 16x  
Multiply x² + 8x + 16 by 4: 4x² + 32x + 64  
Add them together: x³ + 8x² + 16x + 4x² + 32x + 64  
Combine like terms: x³ + (8x² + 4x²) + (16x + 32x) + 64  
Which gives x³ + 12x² + 48x + 64. Yep, same result as before. 

Therefore, the polynomial is x³ + 12x² + 48x + 64. 

Looking back at the problem statement, they mention using the given predicates. Let me check the original problem again. The user provided some predicates involving Cube(1), LengthOf(SideOf(1), SumOf(x,4)), Equals(LengthOf(SideOf(1)), SumOf(x,4)), and Equals(VolumeOf(1), Pow(SumOf(x,4),3)). Wait, maybe there's more structure here?

Wait, the initial problem says "Consider the cube shown. Its length of side is x+4. Find the polynomial that represents the volume of the cube." So the given predicates seem to be setting up that the side length is x + 4, hence Volume is (x + 4)^3, which expands to the polynomial we found. Therefore, the answer should be the expansion of (x + 4)^3, which is x³ + 12x² + 48x + 64. 

I don't see any other elements here. The problem seems straightforward once you recognize that the volume of a cube is the cube of its side length. Since the side length is given as x + 4, cubing that gives the volume as a polynomial in x. Thus, expanding that expression gives the required polynomial.
