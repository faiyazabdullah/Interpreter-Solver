<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the period of this trigonometric function based on the given information. So, the problem says there's a graph of a trigonometric function with a minimum point at (-π/2, 2.4) and a maximum point at (3π/2, 13). We need to find the period.

First, I remember that the period of a trigonometric function relates to how long it takes for the function to complete one full cycle. For sine and cosine functions, the standard period is 2π. But if there's a horizontal stretch or compression, the period changes. The formula for the period is usually 2π divided by the absolute value of the coefficient of x inside the function, like for y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, the period is 2π / |B|.

But here, we don't have the equation of the function directly. Instead, we have two points: a minimum and a maximum. Let me think about how these points relate to the period. 

In a standard sine or cosine curve, the distance between a maximum and the next minimum is half the period. Wait, no—actually, from a maximum to the next minimum is half a period. Because from max to min is half a cycle. Similarly, from min back to max is another half. So the total period would be twice the distance between a maximum and the adjacent minimum.

Alternatively, maybe looking at the difference in x-values between the maximum and minimum points?

Let me check. Suppose we have a function that goes from a maximum at some x-value to a minimum at another x-value. The time between those two points is half the period. So if I can find the difference in their x-coordinates, multiply by 2, that should give me the period.

So the given points are:

Minimum at (-π/2, 2.4)

Maximum at (3π/2, 13)

So the x-coordinate of the minimum is -π/2, and the maximum is at 3π/2. Let me compute the difference between these x-values.

Difference = 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 3π/2 + π/2 = 4π/2 = 2π. 

Wait, so the difference between the maximum and the minimum is 2π. But earlier I thought that the distance between a maximum and the next minimum is half the period. If that difference is 2π, then half the period is 2π, meaning the full period is 4π? That seems conflicting. Let me double-check my reasoning.

Let me recall: For example, take the standard cosine function, which starts at a maximum at x=0, then goes down to a minimum at x=π, then back up to a maximum at x=2π. So from maximum to minimum is π, which is half the period. Therefore, the period is 2*(difference between max and min).

So in this case, the difference between the maximum x-value (3π/2) and the minimum x-value (-π/2) is indeed 2π. So according to this, that difference is half the period. Hence, the period would be twice that difference. Wait, but wait—if the maximum occurs at 3π/2 and the minimum at -π/2, then the distance between them is 2π, which would be half the period. Therefore, the full period would be 4π?

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me visualize. Imagine the function going from a maximum at 3π/2, then decreasing to a minimum at some point, then increasing again. However, the minimum given is at -π/2. So perhaps the function goes from the maximum at 3π/2, decreases to the minimum at -π/2, then increases again. But how does that fit into the periodicity?

Alternatively, maybe the function has its maximum at 3π/2 and minimum at -π/2. Let me think about the horizontal shift. Maybe the function isn't starting at the usual positions. Let me consider the general form of a sinusoidal function:

y = A sin(Bx + C) + D

Or y = A cos(Bx + C) + D.

The period is 2π / |B|. Also, the midline is y = D, and the amplitude is |A|.

But since they gave us specific points, maybe we can find B, which determines the period.

But how?

Well, knowing that the maximum and minimum points occur at certain x-values.

For a standard sine or cosine function, the maximum and minimum occur at specific intervals. For instance, for the standard sine function, the maximums are at π/2 + 2πk and minimums at 3π/2 + 2πk. But if the function is shifted horizontally, the locations of the maxima and minima will change.

Alternatively, considering that between a maximum and the subsequent minimum, the function completes half a period. So the horizontal distance between them is half the period. Therefore, the period would be twice the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum.

So in our case, the horizontal distance between the maximum at x = 3π/2 and the minimum at x = -π/2 is 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 3π/2 + π/2 = 2π. So that's the horizontal distance between the maximum and the minimum. Since that's half the period, the full period would be 2 * 2π = 4π. Therefore, the period is 4π.

But wait, let me confirm this with another approach. Let's suppose that the function has a maximum at x = 3π/2 and a minimum at x = -π/2. Let's imagine that the function is shifted such that these are the key points.

Suppose we have a cosine function that's been transformed. Normally, the maximum of cos(x) is at x=0, then the first minimum is at x=π, then next maximum at x=2π, etc. But if we shift it left or right, those points move accordingly.

Alternatively, if we have a function like y = A cos(Bx + C) + D, then the maximum occurs where Bx + C = 0 mod 2π, and the minimum occurs where Bx + C = π mod 2π.

So, suppose that at x = 3π/2, the function reaches a maximum. Then, solving for Bx + C = 0 mod 2π:

At x = 3π/2,

B*(3π/2) + C = 0 + 2π*k, where k is integer.

Similarly, at the minimum, which is at x = -π/2:

B*(-π/2) + C = π + 2π*m, where m is integer.

Subtracting these two equations:

[B*(3π/2) + C] - [B*(-π/2) + C] = (0 + 2π*k) - (π + 2π*m)

Left side simplifies to B*(3π/2 + π/2) = B*(2π)

Right side: -π + 2π(k - m)

Therefore:

2π*B = -π + 2π(k - m)

Divide both sides by π:

2B = -1 + 2(k - m)

Let’s denote n = k - m, which is an integer.

Thus, 2B = -1 + 2n → B = (-1 + 2n)/2

Now, the period is 2π / |B|. Let's substitute B:

Period = 2π / | (-1 + 2n)/2 | = 2π / ( | -1 + 2n | / 2 ) ) = 2π * 2 / | -1 + 2n | = 4π / | -1 + 2n | 

Since n is any integer, | -1 + 2n | is a positive integer. The smallest possible value of | -1 + 2n | is 1, when n = 1 (then |-1 + 2*1|=1), or n=0 (|-1 + 0|=1). So the minimal period would be 4π / 1 = 4π. However, could there be other possibilities?

But since the question asks for the period, and given that the graph is of a trigonometric function, the period is likely to be the minimal period. So assuming n=1, then B = (-1 + 2*1)/2 = 1/2. So B=1/2, leading to period 2π/(1/2)=4π. Alternatively, if n=0, then B=(-1 + 0)/2=-1/2, leading to same period 4π. 

Hence, regardless of n, the minimal period is 4π. Thus, the period is 4π.

Alternatively, let me check with another approach. Let's assume that between the maximum and the minimum, the function covers half a period. So the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum is half the period. As calculated before, the horizontal distance is 2π. Therefore, half-period = 2π ⇒ period = 4π.

Yes, that matches.

Another way: Let's think of the distance between two consecutive maxima or two consecutive minima as the period. But since we have a max and a min, the distance between them is half the period. Therefore, the period is twice the horizontal distance between max and min.

So, yes, the horizontal distance is 2π, so period is 4π.

Therefore, the answer should be 4π.

Wait, but let me make sure there's not a mistake in calculating the horizontal distance. The x-coordinate of the maximum is 3π/2, and the minimum is at -π/2. So the difference is 3π/2 - (-π/2) = 3π/2 + π/2 = 4π/2 = 2π. Yes, that's correct. So the horizontal distance between the max and min is 2π, hence the period is 4π.

I think that makes sense. So the period is 4π.

Let me also check if there's another way someone might get confused. For example, if someone thought that the distance between the two points is the full period, but that's not the case because between a max and a min, you're only covering half the period. So that's why multiplying by 2 gives the full period.

Another check: Let's say the standard cosine function has period 2π. Its maxima are at x=0, 2π, 4π,... and minima at π, 3π, etc. So between a max at 0 and a min at π, the horizontal distance is π, which is half the period. Hence, the period is 2π. Which aligns with the idea that the distance between max and min is half the period.

Therefore, applying that logic here, since the distance between the max and min is 2π, the period is 4π.

So I think that confirms it. Therefore, the answer is 4π.

**Final Answer**
The period of the function is \boxed{4\pi}.
</think>

To determine the **period** of the given trigonometric function, we analyze the provided points:

- Minimum point: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 2.4\right)$  
- Maximum point: $\left(\frac{3}{2}\pi, 13\right)$

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between maxima and minima

For a **sinusoidal function**, the vertical distance between a **maximum** and the subsequent **minimum** corresponds to **half the period**. This is because the function transitions through a full cycle — from maximum to minimum to maximum — over the course of a full period.

This means that the **horizontal distance between a maximum and a minimum** equals **half the period**.

---

### Step 2: Compute the horizontal distance between the given points

We calculate the difference in the x-coordinates of the maximum and minimum:

$$
\Delta x = \frac{3}{2}\pi - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi\right) = \frac{3}{2}\pi + \frac{1}{2}\pi = 2\pi
$$

So the horizontal distance between the maximum and the minimum is $2\pi$.

---

### Step 3: Determine the full period

Since this distance represents **half** the period, the full period is:

$$
\text{Period} = 2 \times \Delta x = 2 \times 2\pi = 4\pi
$$

---

### Final Answer

$$
\boxed{4\pi}
