MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is asking for the equation of a line that passes through the points (0, -5) and (5, 0). Let me recall how to find the equation of a line given two points.

First, I know that the general form of a line's equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. To find m, I can use the formula for slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2): m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). 

Let me check the given points. One point is (0, -5) and the other is (5, 0). Let me label them as Point A (0, -5) and Point B (5, 0). Wait, the problem mentions Points A and B, but according to the predicates, Equals(A, Point(0,-5)) and Equals(B, Point(5,0)). So, A is (0, -5) and B is (5, 0). 

So, applying the slope formula here: the change in y is 0 - (-5) = 5, and the change in x is 5 - 0 = 5. Therefore, the slope m would be 5/5 = 1. That seems straightforward. 

Now that we have the slope, we need to find the y-intercept b. Since the line passes through (0, -5), which is the y-axis intercept, because when x=0, y is the y-intercept. So plugging x=0 and y=-5 into y = mx + b gives us -5 = m*0 + b → b = -5. 

Wait, so putting it all together, the equation should be y = 1x - 5, which simplifies to y = x - 5. Let me verify if this works with the second point (5, 0). Plugging x=5 into the equation: y = 5 - 5 = 0. Yep, that matches the y-coordinate of the second point. 

But wait, maybe I should double-check my calculation for the slope. Let me re-calculate. The two points are (0, -5) and (5, 0). So, slope m = (0 - (-5))/(5 - 0) = 5/5 = 1. Correct. Then the y-intercept is indeed -5 because when x=0, y=-5. 

Alternatively, another way to think about it: since one of the points is (0, -5), that's the y-intercept directly. So the equation is y = mx - 5. Then, using the other point (5, 0) to find m. Plug in x=5, y=0: 0 = m*5 -5 → 5m = 5 → m=1. Same result. 

Therefore, the equation of the line is y = x - 5. 

I don't see any mistakes here. The problem didn't mention anything complicated like perpendicular or parallel lines, just finding the equation given two points. All steps seem correct. The answer should be y = x - 5.
