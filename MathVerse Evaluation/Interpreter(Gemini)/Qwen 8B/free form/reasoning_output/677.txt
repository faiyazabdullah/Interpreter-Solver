FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
<think>
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the given geometric setup. There are several points labeled A through H, connected by lines forming rectangles and other shapes. The question asks for the measure of angle DFH, denoted as θ, to two decimal places.

Starting with Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup. Let me list out all the given predicates. Points A to H are defined, and there are multiple lines connecting them. The rectangles mentioned include ABCD, EFGH, ABFE, BCFG, CDHG, DAEH, and others. Also, there are several length measures: AB=BC=CD=DA=3 cm, EF=FG=GH=HE=3 cm, AE=BF=CG=DH=14 cm. Additionally, some angles are specified as right angles, like Angle(E,F,B) and Angle(F,E,H). The critical part here is the angle at D-F-H, which is given as 0 degrees? Wait, no—wait, the predicate says MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0), but that seems conflicting because if it's zero, that would mean they're colinear. But maybe that's a typo? Or perhaps I misread. Wait, looking back: "MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0)" and "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H)),0)". So according to the given data, angle DFH is measured as 0 degrees? That doesn't make sense unless points D, F, H are colinear. But how?

Wait, but the problem states that it's a square prism with sides 3cm, 3cm, and 14cm. A square prism typically means a cuboid where the base is a square. However, since there are different side lengths, perhaps it's a rectangular prism with two square faces and rectangular ones. But the given lengths are AB=3, BC=3, so ABCD is a square. Then AE=14, BF=14, CG=14, DH=14. So edges AE, BF, CG, DH are all 14 cm, making the height of the prism 14 cm. Therefore, the prism has square bases with side 3 cm and height 14 cm.

But how does this relate to the angle DFH? Let me try to visualize the structure. Points A, B, C, D form a square base. Points E, F, G, H are the top vertices, connected such that each vertical edge (like AE, BF, CG, DH) is 14 cm. So line AE connects A to E, BF connects B to F, etc. Now, point D is one corner of the base, connected to H via DH (which is 14 cm). Point F is directly above B, since BF is a vertical edge. So line DF connects D to F. And point H is connected to D via DH (vertical edge?), wait no. Wait, the lines given include Line(D,H), which is part of Rectangle(D,A,E,H). So D is connected to H, which would be another vertical edge? Wait, but DH is a vertical edge of length 14 cm. So D is connected to H, which is part of the top face? Maybe not. Let me think again.

The rectangles listed include Rectangle(D,A,E,H). So DA is a side of the base (since DA is part of the square ABCD). Then AE is a vertical edge (connecting A to E), EH connects E to H, and HD connects H to D. So that rectangle DAEH is a rectangle with sides DA (3 cm), AE (14 cm), EH (3 cm), and HD (14 cm). Wait, but that would make DAEH a rectangle with sides 3 and 14. Similarly, the other rectangles. 

So, in this case, the figure is a rectangular prism (a box) with square bases of 3x3 and height 14. The points D, F, H: D is a bottom corner, F is the top corner above B, and H is connected to D. Wait, H is connected to D via DH (from the line DH). Since DH is a vertical edge of length 14 cm, so H is directly above D? No, because the vertical edges are AE, BF, CG, DH. So DH connects D to H, which would be the top vertex above D. Wait, but in a standard prism, each vertical edge goes up from a base vertex. If ABCD is the base, then the top vertices would be E, F, G, H corresponding to A, B, C, D respectively. So E is above A, F above B, G above C, H above D. Thus, line DH connects D (bottom) to H (top), which is vertical, length 14 cm. Similarly, BF connects B to F (top).

Now, we need to find angle DFH. So points D, F, H. Let me sketch mentally. Point D is at the bottom, connected to H (upwards). Point F is the top vertex above B. So line DF connects D to F, which is a diagonal across the lateral face. Line FH connects F to H. So angle at F between D-F and F-H. Wait, no: angle DFH is the angle at point F between points D, F, H. Wait, no. The angle is ∠DFH, which is at point F, formed by points D, F, H. So vertex at F, with segments FD and FH.

To compute this angle, we need vectors or coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to the points to calculate this angle.

Let’s place the base square ABCD in the xy-plane. Let’s set coordinates:

Let me define coordinate system:

Let’s take point A at origin (0, 0, 0). Since ABCD is a square with side length 3. Assuming standard orientation, moving clockwise:

- A(0, 0, 0)
- B(3, 0, 0)
- C(3, 3, 0)
- D(0, 3, 0)

Then, the top face points E, F, G, H are vertically above A, B, C, D respectively, with z-coordinate 14. So:

- E(0, 0, 14)
- F(3, 0, 14)
- G(3, 3, 14)
- H(0, 3, 14)

Wait, but according to the given lines, Line(D,H) exists. In this setup, D is (0, 3, 0) and H is (0, 3, 14)? Wait, no. Because if H is above D, then yes, H would be (0, 3, 14). But according to the rectangle DAEH, which includes points D, A, E, H. So DA is from D(0,3,0) to A(0,0,0), then AE is from A(0,0,0) to E(0,0,14), then EH should connect E(0,0,14) to H(0,3,14)? Wait, but that would make EH horizontal. However, in our previous assumption, H was supposed to be above D, which would be (0,3,14). Then EH would go from E(0,0,14) to H(0,3,14), which is along y-axis. But then DAEH would have sides DA (vertical down), AE (vertical up), EH (horizontal), and HD (vertical down). Wait, but HD would be from H(0,3,14) to D(0,3,0), which is vertical. So yes, that forms a rectangle DAEH, with sides DA=3, AE=14, EH=3, HD=14. Correct.

Similarly, other rectangles:

- Rectangle BCFG: points B(3,0,0), C(3,3,0), G(3,3,14), F(3,0,14). So that's a rectangle with vertical side BF=14, horizontal side BC=3.

- Rectangle CDHG: points C(3,3,0), D(0,3,0), H(0,3,14), G(3,3,14). Wait, but that would require line DG? Wait, line CD is from C(3,3,0) to D(0,3,0). Then line DH is from D(0,3,0) to H(0,3,14). Then HG is from H(0,3,14) to G(3,3,14). Then GC is from G(3,3,14) to C(3,3,0). So that forms a rectangle CDHG, which is a vertical rectangle with width CD=3 (along x-axis from 0 to 3) and height 14.

Wait, but in this setup, point H is (0,3,14). Then line FH connects F(3,0,14) to H(0,3,14). Let me confirm the coordinates of F and H. Yes, F is above B(3,0,0), so F(3,0,14); H is above D(0,3,0), so H(0,3,14). 

Now, angle DFH is the angle at point F between points D, F, H. So we need to find angle at F between FD and FH.

First, find coordinates of D, F, H:

- D: (0, 3, 0)
- F: (3, 0, 14)
- H: (0, 3, 14)

So vectors FD and FH emanate from F. To compute angle between these vectors.

Vector FD is D - F: (0 - 3, 3 - 0, 0 - 14) = (-3, 3, -14)

Vector FH is H - F: (0 - 3, 3 - 0, 14 - 14) = (-3, 3, 0)

Now, the angle between vectors FD and FH can be found using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (FD • FH) / (|FD| |FH|)

Compute FD • FH: (-3)(-3) + (3)(3) + (-14)(0) = 9 + 9 + 0 = 18

Compute |FD|: sqrt((-3)^2 + 3^2 + (-14)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9 + 196) = sqrt(214)

Compute |FH|: sqrt((-3)^2 + 3^2 + 0^2) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18) = 3√2

Therefore,

cosθ = 18 / (sqrt(214) * 3√2) ) = 18 / (3 * sqrt(214*2)) ) = 6 / sqrt(428)

Simplify sqrt(428): 428 factors into 4*107, so sqrt(4*107)=2*sqrt(107)

Thus cosθ = 6/(2√107) = 3/√107 ≈ 3 / 10.344 ≈ 0.2905

Then θ = arccos(3/√107)

Calculate numerical value:

First compute √107 ≈ 10.34408

So 3 / 10.34408 ≈ 0.2905

arccos(0.2905) ≈ ?

Using calculator: arccos(0.2905) ≈ 73 degrees? Let me check:

cos(60°) = 0.5, cos(75°) ≈ 0.2588. Our value is 0.2905, which is between 60° and 75°, closer to 73°.

Let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, compute using inverse cosine:

θ ≈ arccos(3/sqrt(107)).

But let me compute this precisely.

Alternatively, note that 3² + 3² + 14²? Wait, no, earlier computation had FD vector components (-3, 3, -14), so squared magnitude is 9 + 9 + 196 = 214. Wait, but in the calculation above, we have FD • FH = 18, |FD|=sqrt(214), |FH|=sqrt(18). So cos(theta) = 18/(sqrt(214)*sqrt(18)) = 18/(sqrt(214*18)) = 18/sqrt(3852). Wait, but earlier simplification was wrong. Wait, original calculation said:

Wait, FD • FH = 18, |FD| = sqrt(214), |FH| = sqrt(18). Therefore, cos(theta) = 18 / (sqrt(214) * sqrt(18)) )

Which simplifies to 18 / sqrt(214*18) = 18 / sqrt(3852). Simplify sqrt(3852):

Divide 3852 by 4: 3852 / 4 = 963. So sqrt(3852) = 2*sqrt(963). Not sure if helpful. Alternatively, compute decimal value.

Compute denominator: sqrt(214) ≈ 14.628, sqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426, so product ≈ 14.628 * 4.2426 ≈ let's calculate:

Approximate 14.628 * 4.2426:

Multiply 14 * 4.2426 = 59.3964

Add 0.628 * 4.2426 ≈ approx 0.628 * 4.24 ≈ 2.66

Total ≈ 59.3964 + 2.66 ≈ 62.0564

So cos(theta) ≈ 18 / 62.0564 ≈ 0.2901

So theta ≈ arccos(0.2901) ≈ ?

Using calculator input:

arccos(0.2901) ≈ 73.0 degrees? Let me verify with calculator steps.

We know that cos(60°) = 0.5, cos(75°) ≈ 0.2588. So 0.2901 is between those. Let's compute the difference.

At 70 degrees: cos(70°) ≈ 0.3420

At 72 degrees: cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090

At 73 degrees: cos(73°) ≈ 0.2924

Our value is 0.2901, which is slightly less than 0.2924 (at 73°). So the angle is approximately 73.1 degrees?

Let me do linear approximation between 73° and 74°.

At 73°, cos(73°) ≈ 0.2924

At 74°, cos(74°) ≈ 0.2756

Difference between 73° and 74°: Δθ = 1°, Δcosθ ≈ 0.2756 - 0.2924 = -0.0168 per degree.

Our target is 0.2901, which is 0.2924 - 0.2901 = 0.0023 less than at 73°.

So fraction = 0.0023 / 0.0168 ≈ 0.1369 of the interval from 73° to 74°. So θ ≈ 73° + 0.1369° ≈ 73.1369°, so approximately 73.14°.

But precise calculation requires better method. Alternatively, use calculator-like computation.

Alternatively, use the Taylor series or iterative method. However, since this is a thought process, I can accept that the angle is approximately 73.1 degrees. But need to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, use the inverse cosine function. Let me recall that:

cos(θ) = 3 / sqrt(107). Let me compute sqrt(107):

sqrt(100) = 10, sqrt(107) ≈ 10.34408

So 3 / 10.34408 ≈ 0.2905. As before.

Now, using a calculator, arccos(0.2905) is approximately?

Well, if I don't have a calculator, but knowing that cos(73°) ≈ 0.2924, which is very close to 0.2905. Let me see the difference:

At 73°: 0.2924

Target: 0.2905 → difference is -0.0019.

Assuming that the derivative of cosθ at θ=73° is -sin(73°). Let me approximate.

Let f(θ) = cosθ. We want to find θ such that f(θ) = 0.2905, starting from θ₀=73°, where f(θ₀)=0.2924.

Let’s denote θ = θ₀ + Δθ, where Δθ is small.

Then, f(θ) ≈ f(θ₀) + f’(θ₀) * Δθ = 0.2924 - sin(73°) * Δθ.

Set this equal to 0.2905:

0.2924 - sin(73°) * Δθ = 0.2905 → sin(73°)*Δθ = 0.2924 - 0.2905 = 0.0019.

Compute sin(73°): sin(73°) ≈ 0.9563.

So Δθ ≈ 0.0019 / 0.9563 ≈ 0.002 radians? Wait, no, wait. Wait, θ is in degrees, so we need to convert Δθ to degrees.

Wait, the derivative f’(θ) is -sinθ, but when taking derivatives in calculus, θ is in radians. So to avoid confusion, let me switch to radians.

Convert 73° to radians: 73° × π/180 ≈ 1.274 radians.

Compute f'(θ) at θ=1.274 rad: -sin(1.274) ≈ -sin(73°) ≈ -0.9563.

So, using linear approximation:

Δθ_radians ≈ (target - current)/f’(current) = (0.2905 - 0.2924)/(-0.9563) ≈ (-0.0019)/(-0.9563) ≈ 0.00198 radians.

Convert this Δθ to degrees: 0.00198 * (180/π) ≈ 0.00198 * 57.2958 ≈ 0.1134 degrees.

Thus, θ ≈ 73° + 0.1134° ≈ 73.1134°, so approximately 73.11 degrees.

Thus, rounding to two decimal places, θ ≈ 73.11°. However, this is an approximation. For higher accuracy, let's consider that the actual value may differ slightly due to the linearization error.

Alternatively, use more accurate methods. However, given that this is a problem likely designed with exact values, maybe there's an exact expression. Wait, let me re-examine the calculation.

Earlier, we had cosθ = 3 / sqrt(107). Is there a way to simplify this? sqrt(107) is irrational, so it's unlikely. Therefore, we need to compute arccos(3/sqrt(107)) numerically.

Alternatively, compute using a calculator:

Compute 3 divided by sqrt(107):

sqrt(107) ≈ 10.34408043...

3 / 10.34408043 ≈ 0.2905...

Now, using a calculator (pretending I have one here), arccos(0.2905) is approximately 73.1 degrees. Let me check with more precise calculation.

Alternatively, use the identity that tan(theta) = opposite/adjacent, but since we have vectors, perhaps compute tan(theta) using cross product?

Alternatively, since we have the vectors FD and FH, we could also compute the sine of the angle using the cross product magnitude.

But since we already have the cosine, and we've estimated the angle as approximately 73.1 degrees, perhaps we can accept that as the answer. However, to ensure correctness, let me check once more.

Another approach: Using coordinates, compute the angle.

Points:

F(3, 0, 14)

D(0, 3, 0)

H(0, 3, 14)

Vectors FD = D - F = (-3, 3, -14)

FH = H - F = (-3, 3, 0)

Dot product FD · FH = (-3)(-3) + (3)(3) + (-14)(0) = 9 + 9 + 0 = 18

|FD| = sqrt( (-3)^2 + 3^2 + (-14)^2 ) = sqrt(9 + 9 + 196) = sqrt(214) ≈ 14.6287

|FH| = sqrt( (-3)^2 + 3^2 + 0^2 ) = sqrt(9 + 9) = sqrt(18) ≈ 4.2426

cos(theta) = 18 / (14.6287 * 4.2426) ≈ 18 / 62.056 ≈ 0.2901

As before.

Calculating arccos(0.2901):

Using a calculator, arccos(0.2901) ≈ 73.1 degrees.

But to get precise value to two decimal places, perhaps we need more accurate computation.

Alternatively, use a calculator here. Suppose I have access to a calculator, entering 0.2901 and computing arccos.

For example, using an online calculator, arccos(0.2901) is approximately 73.1 degrees. Let me check with more decimals:

Let me use the Taylor series around π/2 (but that's complicated). Alternatively, use iterative method.

Alternatively, use the fact that cos(73°) ≈ 0.2924, as before. Let me assume that the exact value is approximately 73.1 degrees. Given that the problem asks for two decimal places, perhaps the precise value is around 73.11° or similar.

But perhaps there's a mistake in my coordinate assignments? Let me double-check.

Wait, in the problem statement, there is a predicate stating "RightAngle(Angle(D,E,F))", which suggests that angle at E between D-E-F is a right angle. In our coordinate system, point E is (0,0,14), D is (0,3,0), F is (3,0,14). So angle at E between D-E-F. Let me check if this is a right angle.

Vector ED = D - E = (0-0, 3-0, 0-14) = (0, 3, -14)

Vector EF = F - E = (3-0, 0-0, 14-14) = (3, 0, 0)

Dot product of ED and EF is (0)(3) + (3)(0) + (-14)(0) = 0. Hence, they are perpendicular. So angle at E is indeed a right angle, confirming that our coordinates are correct.

Therefore, the calculation of the angle DFH being approximately 73.1 degrees is valid.

However, the problem mentions that there is a predicate "MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0)", but that contradicts our calculation. Wait, hold on! The initial problem statement includes the predicate "MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0)" and "Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H)),0)". This suggests that the angle DFH is 0 degrees, implying that points D, F, H are colinear. But according to our coordinate calculation, they are not. What's going on here?

This discrepancy indicates a potential misunderstanding of the problem setup. Let me revisit the given predicates.

Looking back at the given predicates:

There is a predicate "Angle(D,F,H)" and "MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0)", which implies that angle DFH is 0 degrees. However, according to the coordinates I assigned, this angle isn't zero. This suggests either a miscalculation on my part or a misinterpretation of the diagram.

Wait, but the problem says "A square prism has sides of length 3cm, 3cm and 14cm as shown." Perhaps the diagram differs from my coordinate assignment. Maybe my assumption about the position of H is incorrect.

Alternative interpretation: Perhaps the prism is not aligned such that H is above D. Let me reconsider the structure.

Given that there are multiple rectangles:

- Rectangle(D,A,E,H): So points D, A, E, H form a rectangle. So DA is connected to AE, which is connected to EH, which is connected to HD.

In my previous assumption, DA is from D(0,3,0) to A(0,0,0), AE is from A(0,0,0) to E(0,0,14), EH is from E(0,0,14) to H(0,3,14), and HD is from H(0,3,14) to D(0,3,0). This makes sense, forming a rectangle DAEH with sides DA=3, AE=14, EH=3, HD=14. So this is consistent.

But then, angle DFH is at point F, between D-F and F-H. According to this, the angle is non-zero. However, the given predicate says it's zero. This contradiction suggests that my coordinate assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the prism is oriented differently. Maybe the vertical edges aren't AE, BF, CG, DH, but something else. Let me check the given lines:

The lines given include Line(D,F) and Line(F,H). Also, Rectangle(E,F,G,H) is present. So E-F-G-H-E forms a rectangle. Which would imply that E-F and F-G are sides of the rectangle. Given that EF=3 cm and FG=3 cm (as per LengthOf(E,F,3) and LengthOf(F,G,3)). Wait, no, the LengthOf(E,F,3) and LengthOf(F,G,3) are given. But in a square prism, the top face should be a square, so EF and FG would be sides of the square, hence equal. But according to the problem, the prism has sides 3cm, 3cm, and 14cm. So the base is a square with sides 3cm, and the height is 14cm. So the top face is also a square, so EF and FG are both 3cm. Hence, the rectangle EFGH is a square.

But in this case, points E, F, G, H are the top face, forming a square. So E-F-G-H-E is a square with sides 3cm. Thus, in this case, the line EF is a horizontal side of the top square, and FG is another side. So if E is connected to F, F to G, etc., forming a square.

But then, what about the line DF? Line(D,F) is given. So point D is connected to F. In this scenario, D is a bottom vertex, and F is a top vertex. Depending on the prism's orientation, DF could be a space diagonal.

But if the angle DFH is 0 degrees, that would mean that points D, F, H are colinear, which would imply that F lies on the line DH. But in that case, DH would be a straight line passing through F, which would mean that F is somewhere along DH. But DH is a vertical edge from D to H. If F were on DH, then F would be vertically aligned with D and H, which would mean that F is either D or H, which contradicts the given that F is a distinct point.

This suggests that there's an inconsistency between the given predicates and the geometric configuration. However, since the problem explicitly states that MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0), which suggests that the angle is zero, we must reconcile this.

Perhaps my coordinate system is incorrect. Let me try another approach, assuming that angle DFH is 0 degrees, i.e., points D, F, H are colinear. So DFH is a straight line, meaning that F lies on the line segment DH. But in a prism, DH is a vertical edge from D to H. If F is on DH, then F would be somewhere along that line. But in a typical prism, each top vertex is directly above its corresponding bottom vertex. So if D is connected to H, then H is directly above D, making DH vertical. If F is on DH, then F would be vertically aligned with D and H, but F is supposed to be the top vertex above B, which is a different position.

This suggests that the given condition MeasureOf(Angle(D,F,H),0) might be a red herring or there's a misinterpretation of the diagram. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is zero due to some other reason.

Wait, the problem says "A square prism has sides of length 3cm, 3cm and 14cm as shown." Maybe the prism is not a right prism, but an oblique one? But usually, prisms are right unless stated otherwise. Alternatively, maybe the angle is zero because of some projection or folding?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in interpreting the rectangles. Let me look again at the rectangles given:

- Rectangle(A,B,C,D): This is the base square, with sides AB=BC=CD=DA=3cm.

- Rectangle(E,F,G,H): Top face, square with sides EF=FG=GH=HE=3cm.

- Rectangle(A,B,F,E): This would be a rectangle connecting A to B to F to E. So this rectangle has sides AB=3, BF=14, FE=3, and EA=14. Wait, but in this case, AB is horizontal, BF is vertical, FE is horizontal, and EA is vertical. So this forms a rectangle with sides 3 and 14, making it a rectangle, not a square. Similarly, Rectangle(B,C,G,F) would be a rectangle with BC=3, CG=14, GF=3, FB=14. So these are rectangles, not squares, indicating that the prism is a right rectangular prism with square bases (ABCD and EFGH) and rectangular lateral faces.

But then, what about the other rectangles?

- Rectangle(D,A,E,H): This connects D-A-E-H-D. DA=3, AE=14, EH=3, HD=14. So this is a rectangle, as before.

- Rectangle(C,D,H,G): Connects C-D-H-G-C. CD=3, DH=14, HG=3, GC=14. Another rectangle.

Now, with this, let's reconsider the position of H. In the rectangle DAEH, points D, A, E, H form a rectangle. So DA is from D to A (length 3), AE is from A to E (length 14), EH is from E to H (length 3), and HD is from H to D (length 14). This implies that EH is parallel to DA, and HD is parallel to AE. So EH is horizontal, same direction as DA, and HD is vertical, same direction as AE.

Given that, let me redefine coordinates accordingly.

Let me choose coordinates such that:

- Point A is at (0, 0, 0).

- Since ABCD is a square, let's assume it's in the xy-plane. Let me define:

- A(0, 0, 0)

- B(3, 0, 0)

- C(3, 3, 0)

- D(0, 3, 0)

Now, the top face EFGH is a square, with each side 3cm. But how are these points positioned?

Since Rectangle(A,B,F,E) is a rectangle with sides AB=3 and BF=14. So from point B(3,0,0), moving in some direction to F, then to E, then back to A.

Wait, if AB is from A(0,0,0) to B(3,0,0), and BF is from B(3,0,0) to F. Since ABFE is a rectangle, then BF should be perpendicular to AB. Given that AB is along x-axis, BF should be along y or z-axis. But since the prism has height 14cm, likely BF is vertical, i.e., along z-axis. So point F would be at (3, 0, 14). Similarly, point E would be at (0, 0, 14), completing the rectangle ABFE. Then, EH would be from E(0,0,14) to H, which should be parallel to DA. DA is from D(0,3,0) to A(0,0,0), which is along negative y-axis. So EH should also be along negative y-axis. From E(0,0,14), moving in negative y-direction for length 3cm: H would be at (0, -3, 14)? But this conflicts with the rectangle DAEH. Wait, let me see.

Rectangle DAEH has points D(0,3,0), A(0,0,0), E(0,0,14), H(...). So DA is from D(0,3,0) to A(0,0,0), AE is from A(0,0,0) to E(0,0,14), EH should be from E(0,0,14) to H, and HD from H to D(0,3,0). 

If EH is parallel to DA, which is along negative y-axis, then EH should be from E(0,0,14) in the negative y-direction for length 3, so H would be at (0, -3, 14). Then HD would be from H(0,-3,14) to D(0,3,0). But this would make HD a diagonal line, not vertical. But according to the given, HD is a vertical edge of length 14cm. This suggests inconsistency.

Ah, this indicates that my assumption about the direction of EH is incorrect. Let me rethink.

If DA is from D(0,3,0) to A(0,0,0), which is along negative y-axis. In rectangle DAEH, EH should be parallel to DA, so EH should also be along negative y-axis. But EH starts at E(0,0,14), so moving in negative y-direction for length 3 gives H(0, -3, 14). Then HD would connect H(0,-3,14) to D(0,3,0). This is a diagonal line, not vertical, contradicting the given that HD is a vertical edge of length 14cm.

This suggests that my coordinate system is incorrect. Perhaps the rectangle DAEH is not aligned in the way I assumed. Maybe EH is not along y-axis but along x-axis? Let me try another approach.

Let me consider that the rectangles ABFE, BCFG, CDHG, DAEH are all rectangles with sides 3 and 14. So, for example, ABFE has AB=3, BF=14, FE=3, and EA=14. So AB is horizontal, BF is vertical, FE is horizontal, and EA is vertical. This implies that the top face EFGH is shifted relative to the base ABCD.

Wait, if AB is horizontal from A(0,0,0) to B(3,0,0), and BF is vertical upwards from B(3,0,0) to F(3,0,14), then E would be directly above A, at (0,0,14). Then, FE would be from F(3,0,14) to E(0,0,14), which is horizontal, length 3 cm (distance between x=3 to x=0 at y=0, z=14). This makes sense. Then, EH would be from E(0,0,14) to H, which should be parallel to DA. DA is from D(0,3,0) to A(0,0,0), which is along negative y-axis. So EH should also be along negative y-axis. So from E(0,0,14), move along negative y-axis for 3 cm: H would be at (0, -3, 14). Then HD would connect H(0,-3,14) to D(0,3,0), which is a diagonal, not vertical. But according to the given, HD is a vertical edge of length 14 cm. This is a contradiction.

This suggests that my understanding of the rectangle DAEH is incorrect. Perhaps EH is not parallel to DA? But in a rectangle, opposite sides are parallel. So DA and EH must be parallel. Hence, this indicates a problem with the current coordinate system.

Maybe the issue is that the prism is not aligned with the axes, and the rectangles are not axis-aligned. Alternatively, perhaps the prism is folded in a way that causes EH to be vertical.

Wait, let me try a different coordinate system. Let me assume that the prism is such that the vertical edges are not along the z-axis but in some other direction. For instance, suppose that the vertical edges are along the z-axis, but the top face is rotated.

But this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps the prism is a cube, but no, since it has sides 3, 3, and 14.

Alternatively, let me consider that the angle DFH is zero, as per the given predicate, which suggests that points D, F, H are colinear. So F lies on the line DH. In this case, DH is a vertical edge from D to H, and F is somewhere along this line. But F is also connected to B, as per the line BF. So if F is on DH, then BF would be a line from B to a point F on DH. Let me explore this possibility.

Let me assume that F is on DH. So DH is from D to H, and F is somewhere along DH. Given that BF is a vertical edge of length 14 cm, as per LengthOf(B,F,14). So BF is from B to F, which is length 14 cm. If F is on DH, then we can find coordinates of F such that BF=14 cm.

Let me attempt to set up coordinates again with this assumption.

Let me define D at (0, 0, 0) for simplicity. Then, since ABCD is a square with side 3 cm, let me define:

- D(0, 0, 0)

- C(3, 0, 0)

- B(3, 3, 0)

- A(0, 3, 0)

Wait, this assumes a different orientation of the square. Let me clarify:

If ABCD is a square, and assuming it's in the xy-plane, with D at (0, 0, 0), C at (3, 0, 0), B at (3, 3, 0), and A at (0, 3, 0). Then, the vertical edges are from each base vertex to the top face. Let's say the top face is EFGH, with E above A, F above B, G above C, H above D. So:

- E is above A(0,3,0), so E(0,3,14)

- F is above B(3,3,0), so F(3,3,14)

- G is above C(3,0,0), so G(3,0,14)

- H is above D(0,0,0), so H(0,0,14)

Now, let's check the rectangles:

- Rectangle(A,B,C,D): This is the base, from A(0,3,0) to B(3,3,0) to C(3,0,0) to D(0,0,0). Wait, this would form a square? Let me check distances:

AB: distance from A(0,3,0) to B(3,3,0) is 3 cm.

BC: from B(3,3,0) to C(3,0,0) is 3 cm (y decreases from 3 to 0).

CD: from C(3,0,0) to D(0,0,0) is 3 cm (x decreases from 3 to 0).

DA: from D(0,0,0) to A(0,3,0) is 3 cm. So yes, it's a square.

Now, rectangle ABFE: points A(0,3,0), B(3,3,0), F(3,3,14), E(0,3,14). This is a rectangle with sides AB=3, BF=14, FE=3, and EA=14. Correct.

Similarly, other rectangles.

Now, let's examine the line DH: from D(0,0,0) to H(0,0,14). So this is a vertical line along x=0, y=0, z from 0 to 14.

Point F is at (3,3,14). But according to this setup, F is not on DH, since DH is x=0, y=0. So this contradicts the given that angle DFH is 0 degrees, implying F is on DH.

But if F is on DH, then F must lie on the line from D(0,0,0) to H(0,0,14). Let's say F is at (0,0,k), where k is between 0 and 14. But then BF is the line from B(3,3,0) to F(0,0,k), and its length is 14 cm. Let's calculate k such that the distance from B(3,3,0) to F(0,0,k) is 14.

Distance BF = sqrt((3-0)^2 + (3-0)^2 + (0-k)^2) = sqrt(9 + 9 + k²) = sqrt(18 + k²) = 14.

So 18 + k² = 196 → k² = 178 → k = sqrt(178) ≈ 13.34 cm. This is possible, but it changes the position of F. However, this would mean that F is not directly above B, but somewhere along DH. This would alter the structure of the prism, making it an oblique prism, but the problem states it's a square prism, which usually implies a right prism. However, if we proceed with this, let's see.

In this case, F is at (0,0,sqrt(178)), and H is at (0,0,14). So line DF is from D(0,0,0) to F(0,0,sqrt(178)), and line FH is from F(0,0,sqrt(178)) to H(0,0,14). These two lines are collinear, so angle DFH is 0 degrees, as required by the predicate. This satisfies the condition.

But this setup changes the structure of the prism. Now, the top face EFGH would have points E, F, G, H. Let's try to define E and G.

Since Rectangle(E,F,G,H) is a square with sides 3 cm. Let's assume that E is connected to F and H. But in this new setup, F is at (0,0,sqrt(178)), and H is at (0,0,14). So EH would be from E to H, and EF from E to F. If EFGH is a square, then EH and EF should be perpendicular and of equal length.

But this seems complex. Let me try to define E and G.

Assume that
