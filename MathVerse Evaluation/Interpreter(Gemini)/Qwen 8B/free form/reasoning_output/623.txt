<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have two piecewise functions, f and g, graphed in blue and purple respectively. The question says that the airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon, and we need to find the other time they have the same height, rounded to the nearest ten minutes.

First, I need to understand the given points for each function. Let me list them out again:

For function g (purple):
- Goes through (0, 10000), (40, 9000), (80, 9000), (100, 11000), (130, 11000).

For function f (blue):
- Goes through (10, 11000), (50, 11000), (60, 10000), (100, 10000), (120, 0).

Wait, the problem mentions that t is the number of minutes since noon. So the x-axis here is time in minutes, and the y-axis is the height of the airplanes. We need to find two times when both functions have the same y-value, i.e., when f(t) = g(t). One of these times is approximately 9 minutes, and we need to find the other one.

So first, maybe I should model the functions f and g as piecewise linear functions based on the given points. Since they're piecewise functions, each segment between consecutive points would be a straight line. But how do I know where the segments start and end? Well, the points given are ordered, so probably each pair of consecutive points defines a segment. However, there might be more than one segment per function.

Let me think. For example, function g has points at (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000). Wait, but the x-values here are increasing, so each consecutive pair forms a line segment. Similarly for function f: (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). Again, ordered by x-coordinate.

But how do we handle the fact that they are piecewise functions? Maybe each segment between two consecutive points is a linear function. Therefore, for each interval between two x-values, we can write equations for f(t) and g(t) and find their intersection points within those intervals.

Given that one of the intersection points is around t=9 minutes, which is near the beginning of the domain. So perhaps the other intersection point is somewhere else.

Alternatively, maybe the functions are defined over different intervals. For example, maybe each segment is between certain x-values. Let me check the points again.

For function g:

Between x=0 and x=40: from (0,10000) to (40,9000)

Then from x=40 to x=80: (40,9000) to (80,9000) – that's a horizontal line?

From x=80 to x=100: (80,9000) to (100,11000)

From x=100 to x=130: (100,11000) to (130,11000) – another horizontal line.

Similarly for function f:

From x=10 to x=50: (10,11000) to (50,11000) – horizontal line.

From x=50 to x=60: (50,11000) to (60,10000)

From x=60 to x=100: (60,10000) to (100,10000) – horizontal line.

From x=100 to x=120: (100,10000) to (120,0)

So, if I consider each of these segments, I can write equations for each part of f and g, then check where they intersect.

Now, since we already know that at t≈9 minutes, they are equal. That must be in the first segment of function g and possibly the first segment of function f? Wait, function f starts at x=10. So at t=9, which is before x=10, but function f isn't defined there. Hmm. Wait, maybe the functions are defined for t ≥ 0? Or maybe the given points are just samples, and the actual functions could be extrapolated?

Wait, the problem says "the airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon". So t=9 is a time when both functions have the same height. But looking at the given points for f, it starts at x=10. So perhaps the functions are defined beyond the given points? Or maybe there's an assumption that the functions are linear between the given points, even if the given points don't include t=9?

Wait, but the given points for g include t=0, so maybe the function g is defined from t=0 onwards, while function f starts at t=10? Or maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the functions are defined as follows: for example, function g is defined for t from 0 to 130, and function f is defined for t from 10 to 120? But how does that work?

Alternatively, perhaps the functions are constructed such that between the given points, they follow straight lines, and outside of those points, they may not be defined. However, since the problem states that there is an intersection at t≈9, which is before the starting point of function f (which starts at t=10), that suggests that maybe the functions are extended beyond their given points? Or perhaps the given points are not necessarily the entire domain?

This seems confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement.

The problem says: "Two piecewise function g and f are graphed, g is graphed in purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), f is graphed in blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0)."

So the functions go through these points. But the functions are piecewise, so they consist of straight-line segments between these points. So for example, function g is made up of segments connecting (0,10000)-(40,9000), (40,9000)-(80,9000), (80,9000)-(100,11000), (100,11000)-(130,11000). Similarly for f: (10,11000)-(50,11000), (50,11000)-(60,10000), (60,10000)-(100,10000), (100,10000)-(120,0).

Therefore, the domain of function g is from t=0 to t=130, and function f is from t=10 to t=120. However, the problem says that the airplanes have the same height at about 9 minutes after noon. That would be t=9, which is before t=10. But according to the given points, function f doesn't exist before t=10. How is that possible?

Ah! Perhaps the functions are considered to be continuous beyond their given points? Or maybe the functions are defined for all t ≥ 0, and the given points are sample points. But without knowing how the functions behave outside the given points, we can't assume anything. This seems like a contradiction unless there's some missing information.

Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the functions are linear beyond the last given point? Or perhaps the functions are only defined between the given points, and the intersection at t=9 is actually within the domain of g but not of f? But that wouldn't make sense because the problem states that they have the same height at that time.

Alternatively, maybe the functions are defined for all t, and the given points are just sampled points. In that case, we need to model the functions as linear between the given points, but also extrapolate beyond them if necessary. However, since the problem mentions that the airplanes have the same height at about 9 minutes, which is before the first point of f (t=10), that suggests that maybe the functions are defined for all t, and the given points are just samples.

Wait, but the problem says "graphed" so perhaps the graphs are only defined between the given points. But then, how can there be an intersection at t=9?

This seems contradictory. Unless there's a misunderstanding in interpreting the points.

Wait, perhaps the functions are not strictly piecewise linear between the given points, but instead, each segment is determined by the given points. For example, function g has points at (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000). So between t=0 and t=40, it's a line from (0,10000) to (40,9000); between t=40 and t=80, horizontal line; between t=80 and t=100, rising to (100,11000); then horizontal again until t=130.

Similarly, function f has points at (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). So between t=10 and t=50, horizontal; then from t=50 to t=60, decreasing; then horizontal again from t=60 to t=100; then dropping from t=100 to t=120.

If that's the case, then the functions are only defined between their respective points. So function f is only defined from t=10 to t=120, and function g from t=0 to t=130. Therefore, the intersection at t=9 would require that function f exists at t=9, but according to the given points, it doesn't. Hence, this suggests that there's an error in my understanding.

Alternatively, maybe the functions are defined for all t, and the given points are just some samples, but we need to assume that they are linear between the points. However, since the problem says they are piecewise functions, it's likely that they are composed of line segments between the given points. Thus, the intersection at t=9 must occur in the domain of g, but not of f. But how?

Wait, maybe the problem allows for extrapolation. Suppose that for t < 10, function f is undefined, but the problem still claims that the airplanes have the same height at t=9. That seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the interpretation of the points.

Wait, looking back at the given points for function f: (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). These points suggest that function f starts at t=10, but maybe the function is defined for t ≤ 120. However, the problem mentions that the airplanes have the same height at t=9. This implies that both functions must be defined at t=9. Therefore, either there's a typo in the problem, or I'm misinterpreting the points.

Alternatively, maybe the functions are not strictly between the given points but instead are defined for all t, with the given points being part of their definition. For example, maybe the functions are linear beyond the given points. But without additional information, this is speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the functions as being defined over the entire real line, and the given points are just examples. Then, the functions are piecewise linear, but the segments extend infinitely. However, that would require knowing the behavior beyond the given points, which we don't have.

Wait, maybe the problem is designed so that the intersection occurs within the domain where both functions are defined. Given that the known intersection is at t≈9, which is before t=10, but function f starts at t=10. Therefore, this suggests that the intersection occurs in the segment of function g that extends before t=10, but function f is not defined there. This is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the given points for function f are not the only points, but the functions are defined for all t. For instance, maybe function f is defined as follows: for t < 10, it's some extension of the previous segment. However, since no information is given about that, we cannot assume.

Hmm. This seems like a critical issue. If we cannot resolve this, we might not be able to proceed. Let me look back at the problem statement again.

Wait, the problem says that the airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon. So that's t=9. And we need to find the other time. Since the problem gives us the functions' points, maybe the intersection occurs in the segment of g that includes t=9. Let's suppose that the functions are defined for all t, and that between the given points, they are linear. Therefore, for t < 10, function f is not defined, but function g is defined. However, the problem states that they have the same height at t=9, implying that both functions are defined there. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my assumptions.

Wait, maybe the functions are defined as follows: for function g, the points are given, but the function continues beyond the last point. For example, after t=130, it might continue linearly. Similarly, for function f, after t=120, it continues linearly. But without knowing the slope beyond the last point, we can't model that. 

Alternatively, maybe the functions are only defined between the given points, and the intersection at t=9 is due to an extrapolation. But without knowing the behavior beyond the given points, this is impossible.

This seems like a dead end. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is not about the functions being defined for all t, but rather, the given points define the entire function. So, for example, function g is only defined between t=0 and t=130, and function f between t=10 and t=120. But then, how can they intersect at t=9? It's possible that the problem contains a mistake, but assuming that the problem is correct, there must be a way.

Wait, maybe the given points are not the endpoints of the functions but just sample points. For example, function f could be defined for t ≥ 10, and function g for t ≥ 0. The intersection at t=9 would require that function f is defined there, which contradicts. Unless... wait, maybe the given points for function f are not necessarily the entire domain. For example, maybe function f is defined for t ≥ 10, but the point (10,11000) is the starting point, and it continues linearly beyond that. Similarly, function g is defined for t ≥ 0, continuing linearly beyond its last point.

In that case, we can model the functions as linear beyond the given points. However, since we don't know the slopes beyond the last points, we can't do that. But wait, the problem says they are piecewise functions, so maybe each segment is defined between the given points, and beyond that, they stop. But then again, the intersection at t=9 would not be possible.

Alternatively, maybe the given points for function f are not the only ones. For example, maybe the function f is a quadratic or something else. But the problem says it's a piecewise function, so likely linear segments.

At this point, I think the key is to ignore the confusion about the domain and focus on the given points. Assuming that the functions are defined between their given points, and the intersection occurs within the overlapping domain. For example, if the intersection at t=9 is in the domain of g, and the other intersection is in the domain of both functions.

But how can that be? Let's see. If the intersection at t=9 is in the segment of g that goes from t=0 to t=40, then we need to check if there's another intersection in the overlapping domain of both functions.

Since function f starts at t=10, the overlapping domain would be from t=10 onward. So the other intersection would be in that region.

So let's proceed under the assumption that the functions are defined as linear between the given points, and the intersection at t=9 is in the segment of g from t=0 to t=40, and the other intersection is in the overlapping domain of both functions (from t=10 onward).

So, first, let's model function g and function f as piecewise linear functions.

Starting with function g:

Segment 1: From t=0 to t=40, going from (0,10000) to (40,9000). The slope here is (9000 - 10000)/(40 - 0) = (-1000)/40 = -25. So equation: y = -25t + 10000.

Segment 2: From t=40 to t=80, horizontal line at y=9000.

Segment 3: From t=80 to t=100, going from (80,9000) to (100,11000). Slope is (11000 - 9000)/(100 - 80) = 2000/20 = 100. Equation: y = 100(t - 80) + 9000 → y = 100t - 8000 + 9000 = 100t + 1000? Wait, let me recalculate:

Wait, at t=80, y=9000. So the equation is y = m(t - 80) + 9000. With m=100, so y = 100(t - 80) + 9000 = 100t - 8000 + 9000 = 100t + 1000? No, that would give at t=80, y=100*80 + 1000 = 8000 + 1000 = 9000, correct. At t=100, y=100*100 + 1000 = 10000 + 1000 = 11000, which matches. Wait, but that would mean the equation is y = 100t + 1000? Wait, no. Wait, 100t - 8000 + 9000 = 100t + 1000? Yes, 9000 - 8000 is 1000. So yes, y = 100t + 1000? Wait, but at t=80, y = 100*80 + 1000 = 8000 + 1000 = 9000, correct. At t=100, y=100*100 + 1000 = 10000 + 1000 = 11000, correct. So that's Segment 3: y = 100t + 1000 from t=80 to t=100.

Segment 4: From t=100 to t=130, horizontal line at y=11000.

Now, function f:

Segment 1: From t=10 to t=50, horizontal line at y=11000.

Segment 2: From t=50 to t=60, going from (50,11000) to (60,10000). Slope is (10000 - 11000)/(60 - 50) = (-1000)/10 = -100. Equation: y = -100(t - 50) + 11000 → y = -100t + 5000 + 11000 = -100t + 16000.

Check at t=50: y = -100*50 + 16000 = -5000 + 16000 = 11000, correct. At t=60: -100*60 + 16000 = -6000 + 16000 = 10000, correct.

Segment 3: From t=60 to t=100, horizontal line at y=10000.

Segment 4: From t=100 to t=120, going from (100,10000) to (120,0). Slope is (0 - 10000)/(120 - 100) = -10000 / 20 = -500. Equation: y = -500(t - 100) + 10000 → y = -500t + 50000 + 10000 = -500t + 60000.

Check at t=100: y = -500*100 + 60000 = -50000 + 60000 = 10000, correct. At t=120: y = -500*120 + 60000 = -60000 + 60000 = 0, correct.

Okay, now we have equations for each segment of both functions.

Now, the problem states that the airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon. So t=9. Let's check if that's possible.

Looking at function g: from t=0 to t=40, the equation is y = -25t + 10000. At t=9: y = -25*9 + 10000 = -225 + 10000 = 9775.

Now, for function f: it starts at t=10. So before t=10, function f is not defined? Or is there an extension?

Assuming that function f is defined only from t=10 onward, then at t=9, function f is undefined. But the problem says that they have the same height at t=9. This suggests that either:

1. There's a mistake in the problem statement, or

2. The functions are defined for all t, and the given points are just samples, and we need to extrapolate the functions beyond the given points.

But since we don't have information about how the functions behave beyond their given points, this is uncertain. However, given that the problem asks for the other time when they have the same height, and one of them is at t≈9, perhaps we are meant to assume that function f is defined for all t, and that beyond t=120, it continues linearly, or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended that function f is defined for t >= 10, and the intersection at t=9 is actually in the domain of g, and the other intersection is in the domain where both are defined (t >=10). But then, how can they intersect at t=9?

This seems like a contradiction, but maybe the problem is designed with the intention that the functions are defined for all t, and that the given points are samples, allowing us to extrapolate. For example, for t < 10, function f might be extending backwards. Let's explore this possibility.

Suppose that function f is defined for all t, and between its given points, it's linear. So for t < 10, we can extrapolate the segment before t=10. However, function f has its first given point at t=10, so to extrapolate backward, we need to know the behavior before that. But since no information is given, this is impossible. Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the given points for function f are not the only ones, and the functions are defined as follows: for example, function f is a piecewise linear function with the given points, but the segments are connected continuously. However, without more information, this is speculative.

Given the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to proceed under the assumption that the intersection at t=9 occurs in the segment of g, and that the other intersection occurs in the overlapping domain of both functions, which is t >=10. Let's proceed with that.

So, first, check if t=9 is in the domain of g. Yes, since g is defined from t=0 to t=130. At t=9, function g's value is y = -25*9 + 10000 = 9775. Now, function f is not defined at t=9, but the problem says they have the same height. This suggests that either:

- There is an error in the problem statement, or

- The functions are defined for all t, and the given points are samples. So, for example, function f might have a segment before t=10. To find that, we need to assume that the function f is linear beyond the given points. But how?

Wait, perhaps the functions are defined as linear beyond their last given point. For example, for function f, after t=120, it continues linearly. Similarly, for function g, after t=130, it continues linearly. But since we need to find an intersection at t=9, which is far before the start of function f, this seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the functions are defined as linear for all t, with the given points defining their slopes. For example, function f might have a slope defined by the segment before t=10. But without knowing that slope, we can't compute it.

This is very confusing. Given that this is a problem presented for solving, I'll proceed under the assumption that there's a typo and that the function f actually starts at t=0, or that the given points for f include t=0. Let me check the original problem again.

Original problem says: "f is graphed in blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0)." So no, the first point is at t=10.

Wait, but the problem says that the airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon. So, if t=9 is in the domain of g and not of f, but the problem says they have the same height, there must be another explanation. Perhaps the functions are defined for all t, and the given points are just samples, but the functions are linear in all regions. For example, function f might have a segment before t=10, which we can infer from the given points.

Wait, for example, if we assume that function f is linear between its given points, including before t=10. But since the first given point is at t=10, we can't determine the slope before that. However, maybe the function f is defined as follows: from t=-∞ to t=120, and the given points are samples. But without knowing the slope before t=10, we can't calculate the value at t=9.

This seems impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake, but since it's a math problem, I need to proceed. Let me try to think differently. Perhaps the given points for function f are not in order? Or maybe there's a misread in the problem.

Wait, looking back at the original problem statement, the user provided several points with equalities like Equals(0, Point(A)), Equals(40, Point(B)), etc. But I think that's unrelated to the main problem. The main problem involves functions g and f with given points. Let me focus on that.

Perhaps the key is that the given points for function f include (10,11000), and that the function is defined as linear between the points, so for t < 10, we need to extrapolate. But since there's no data before t=10, this is not possible. However, maybe the function f is a straight line from t=0 to t=120, passing through those points? No, because the given points aren't colinear. For example, from t=10 to t=50, it's horizontal, then drops to t=60, then stays flat until t=100, then drops to zero at t=120. So it's definitely piecewise.

Given all this confusion, maybe the problem expects us to ignore the domain issues and proceed with the given points, assuming that the functions are defined for all t, and that the intersection at t=9 occurs in the segment of g and in the extrapolation of f. Let's try that.

Assume that function f is defined for all t, and that between t=10 and t=50, it's horizontal at y=11000. Before t=10, we need to assume it's linear. But since we don't have information, maybe we can assume that it's linear from t=10 backwards? But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the given points for f include t=10, and we can assume that the segment before t=10 is such that it connects to the next segment. For example, if we assume that the function f is linear from t=10 to t=50, then from t=50 to t=60, etc. But before t=10, it's not defined. So at t=9, it's undefined. Hence, the problem must have a mistake.

But since the problem is presented as solvable, I need to proceed. Perhaps the intended solution is to consider the overlap between the functions where both are defined, and find the other intersection point in that region, assuming that the intersection at t=9 is in the domain of g and f. But how?

Maybe the given points for f are incorrect, and one of them is supposed to be at t=0. For example, if the first point was (0,11000), then function f would be defined from t=0 onward. Let me check the original problem statement again.

No, the given points for f are (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). So no, the first point is at t=10.

At this point, I think the only way forward is to assume that the intersection at t=9 is in the domain of g and in the extrapolation of f. Even though it's not logically consistent, maybe the problem expects us to proceed.

So, let's proceed as follows:

We know that at t=9, the height of g is 9775, as calculated earlier. Assume that at t=9, function f also has the same height. So, we need to find the equation of f at t=9. But since f is defined from t=10 onward, we need to assume that before t=10, it's linear. But how?

Perhaps the function f is linear from t=10 to t=50, and we can assume that it extends backward. But without knowing the slope before t=10, this is impossible. However, if we assume that the segment from t=10 to t=50 is horizontal, then before t=10, the function f would also be horizontal? No, because the segment from t=10 to t=50 is horizontal, so if we extend it backward, it would remain horizontal. Hence, for t < 10, f(t) = 11000.

Wait, if the segment from t=10 to t=50 is horizontal at y=11000, then if we extend it backward, it would still be y=11000 for t <= 10. Hence, at t=9, f(9) = 11000. But according to function g at t=9, it's 9775, which is not equal. Hence, this contradicts the problem's statement that they have the same height at t=9.

This suggests that this assumption is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the segment from t=10 to t=50 is not horizontal, but the given points are (10,11000) and (50,11000), which are horizontal. So the slope is zero. Hence, if we extend it backward, it remains horizontal. So f(t)=11000 for t <= 50. Hence, at t=9, f(t)=11000, while g(t)=9775, which is not equal. Hence, this is inconsistent with the problem's statement.

Therefore, this approach is invalid.

Another idea: perhaps the given points for f are not in order? For example, maybe there's a mistake in the order of the points. Let me check: the points for f are (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). These are in increasing x-order, so t increases from 10 to 50 to 60 to 100 to 120. So the segment from 10 to 50 is horizontal, then from 50 to 60 is descending, etc.

If we assume that function f is defined for all t, and that the segment before t=10 is such that it connects to the segment from t=10 to t=50. But without knowing the behavior before t=10, we cannot determine the value at t=9.

Given that this is a math problem, and the answer is expected to be found, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the domain issue and focus on finding where the functions intersect in their defined domains, assuming that the intersection at t=9 is in the domain of g and in the domain of f, which requires that f is defined at t=9. Therefore, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation for function g at t=9. The first segment of g is from t=0 to t=40, with equation y = -25t + 10000. At t=9: y = -25*9 + 10000 = -225 + 10000 = 9775.

Now, if we assume that function f is defined for t=9, then we need to find its value at t=9. But since f starts at t=10, this is not possible. Hence, the only way this makes sense is if the function f is defined for t=9, which would require that the first segment of f includes t=9. But the given points for f start at t=10. 

Wait, unless there's a mistake in the problem and the first point for f is at t=0. Let me check the original problem statement again. No, it says (10,11000) as the first point.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and the only plausible conclusion is that the problem contains an error, but since it's a math problem, I'll proceed under the assumption that the intersection at t=9 is in the domain of both functions, and that function f is defined for t=9. To do this, I'll assume that the first segment of f extends back to t=0. Let's say that the segment from t=10 to t=50 is part of a larger linear segment that includes t=0.

Wait, but how? Let's suppose that function f is linear from t=0 to t=50, passing through (10,11000) and (50,11000). But if it's linear from t=0 to t=50, and passes through (10,11000) and (50,11000), then the slope would be (11000 - 11000)/(50 - 10) = 0, so it's horizontal. Hence, for t=0 to t=50, f(t) = 11000. Hence, at t=9, f(t)=11000, and g(t)=9775. Not equal.

But the problem says they are equal at t=9. Hence, this is inconsistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the segment from t=10 to t=50 is part of a linear segment that starts earlier. For example, if the function f is linear from t=0 to t=50, passing through (10,11000) and (50,11000), which would make it horizontal. But then, at t=9, f(t)=11000, and g(t)=9775, which are not equal.

Alternatively, maybe the function f is linear from t=0 to t=60, passing through (10,11000) and (60,10000). Let's try that. If that's the case, the slope would be (10000 - 11000)/(60 - 10) = -1000/50 = -20. So the equation would be y = -20(t - 0) + 11000? Wait, no. If it's passing through (10,11000) and (60,10000), then the equation is y = -20t + b. Plugging in t=10, y=11000: 11000 = -20*10 + b => b = 11000 + 200 = 11200. So equation: y = -20t + 11200. At t=9: y = -20*9 + 11200 = -180 + 11200 = 11020. At t=9, g(t)=9775, so not equal. Still not matching.

But the problem says they are equal at t=9. So this suggests that the function f at t=9 is 9775. Let's set up the equation: if we assume that function f is linear from t=0 to t=10, passing through (0, y0) and (10,11000). But we don't know y0. Let's call it y0. Then the slope is (11000 - y0)/10. But we also know that at t=50, the function f is at 11000. So from t=10 to t=50, it's horizontal, which implies that the slope from t=10 to t=50 is zero. Hence, if the function is linear from t=0 to t=10, and then horizontal from t=10 to t=50, then at t=10, the value is 11000. Hence, the equation from t=0 to t=10 is y = m*t + c. At t=10, y=11000, and at t=0, y=c. Also, since it's linear from t=0 to t=10, and then horizontal, we need to ensure continuity. But without knowing the value at t=0, this is impossible.

However, if we assume that at t=0, the value of f is the same as at t=10, which is 11000, then the function f is constant from t=0 to t=50, hence y=11000. But then at t=9, f(t)=11000, and g(t)=9775, which are not equal. Hence, this is not the case.

This is really perplexing. Given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I think I need to proceed with the assumption that the intersection at t=9 is in the domain of g and that the other intersection is in the domain where both functions are defined (t >=10), and that the problem may have a typo, but I'll proceed to find the second intersection in the overlapping domain.

So, let's forget about t=9 and focus on finding the other intersection in the domain where both functions are defined, which is t >=10.

So, we need to find t >=10 where f(t) = g(t).

To do this, we need to examine each segment of g and each segment of f, and find where they intersect.

Let's list the segments for g and f:

Segments of g:
1. t ∈ [0, 40): y = -25t + 10000
2. t ∈ [40, 80): y = 9000
3. t ∈ [80, 100]: y = 100t + 1000 (wait, earlier calculation said y = 100t + 1000? Wait, no, earlier calculation said for segment 3, from t=80 to t=100, the equation is y = 100t - 8000 + 9000 = 100t + 1000? Wait, no, let me recheck:

Earlier, for segment 3: from (80,9000) to (100,11000). The slope is (11000 - 9000)/(100 - 80) = 2000/20 = 100. So the equation is y - 9000 = 100(t - 80), so y = 100t - 8000 + 9000 = 100t + 1000. Wait, that would mean at t=80, y = 100*80 + 1000 = 8000 + 1000 = 9000, correct. At t=100, y = 100*100 + 1000 = 11000, correct. So yes, y = 100t + 1000 for t ∈ [80, 100]. Wait, but that would mean at t=100, y=11000, which matches. But for t=80, y=9000. Wait, no: 100*80 + 1000 = 8000 + 1000 = 9000. Correct.

Segment 4: t ∈ [100, 130]: y = 11000.

Segments of f:
1. t ∈ [10, 50]: y = 11000
2. t ∈ [50, 60]: y = -100t + 16000
3. t ∈ [60, 100]: y = 10000
4. t ∈ [100, 120]: y = -500t + 60000

Now, we need to find t >=10 where f(t) = g(t). Let's analyze each possible overlap.

First, let's note the ranges for each segment:

For g: 
- [0,40): y = -25t + 10000
- [40,80): y = 9

====================================================================================================
EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $- [40,80): y = 9$
