QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\tan a$.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the value of tan(a) where angle a is in standard position, and its terminal side intersects the circle at point P(-21/29, 20/29). The circle has center O at the origin (0,0) and radius 1. 

First, I remember that in standard position, the angle's vertex is at the origin, and the initial side is along the positive x-axis. The terminal side passes through point P on the unit circle. Since it's the unit circle, the radius is 1, so the distance from O to P should be 1. Let me check if that's true here. The coordinates of P are (-21/29, 20/29). To confirm it lies on the unit circle, I can calculate the distance from O to P. The formula for distance is sqrt(x² + y²). So plugging in, we get sqrt[(-21/29)² + (20/29)²]. That simplifies to sqrt[(441 + 400)/29²] = sqrt[841/841] because 441 + 400 is 841, and denominator is 29²=841. So sqrt(841/841)=sqrt(1)=1. Yep, that checks out. So P is indeed on the unit circle centered at O.

Now, since angle a is in standard position, the terminal side passes through P. To find tan(a), I recall that tangent of an angle in standard position is equal to y/x, where (x, y) are the coordinates of the point where the terminal side intersects the unit circle. Wait, but is that correct? Let me think. Yes, because for any point (x, y) on the unit circle, the coordinates correspond to (cosθ, sinθ) where θ is the angle. Therefore, tanθ = sinθ / cosθ = y/x. So even though the radius is 1, the ratio y/x gives tanθ directly.

So applying that here, tan(a) would be y-coordinate divided by x-coordinate of point P. The coordinates of P are (-21/29, 20/29). Therefore, tan(a) = (20/29) / (-21/29). The denominators cancel out, leaving 20/-21, which simplifies to -20/21. But wait, tangent is sine over cosine, which is y/x. However, since the x-coordinate is negative and y is positive, the angle a is in the second quadrant where tangent is negative. So tan(a) is negative. 

But let me make sure there's no mistake here. Let me verify again. If the point is (-21/29, 20/29), then yes, x is -21/29, y is 20/29. So tan(theta) = y/x = (20/29)/(-21/29) = -20/21. So that seems straightforward. 

Alternatively, could there be another way to approach this? Maybe using right triangles. Since the radius is 1, the triangle formed by O, P, and the projection of P onto the x-axis would be a right triangle. The adjacent side length would be |x|, which is 21/29, but since x is negative, the actual horizontal component is negative. The opposite side is y, which is 20/29. Then tan(theta) is opposite over adjacent, which would be (20/29)/(21/29) but considering the sign. Wait, but in reality, the adjacent side is negative because the x-coordinate is negative. So tan(theta) would be opposite over adjacent, which is (positive 20/29) divided by (negative 21/29), hence negative. So same result. 

Therefore, regardless of the method, tan(a) is -20/21. 

I don't think there's any other consideration here. The problem states that the circle has radius 1, so we don't have to adjust for scaling. Also, since it's the unit circle, the coordinates directly give us sine and cosine, so the calculation is straightforward. 

Another check: maybe compute the angle itself and then take the tangent. Let me try that. The coordinates of P are (-21/29, 20/29). So cos(theta) = x = -21/29, sin(theta) = y = 20/29. Then theta is arccos(-21/29) and arcsin(20/29). Let me compute tan(theta) as sin(theta)/cos(theta) = (20/29)/(-21/29) = -20/21. Same result. So that confirms it. 

Thus, the value of tan(a) is -20/21.
