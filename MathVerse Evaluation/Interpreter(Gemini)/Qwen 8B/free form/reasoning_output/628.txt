QUESTION:
Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

If the graph is translated 10 units up, what will be the coordinates of the new $y$-intercept?

State the coordinates in the form $(a, b)$.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to figure out the new y-intercept after translating the graph of y = 4 - x up by 10 units. Let me start by recalling some basics about linear functions and translations.

First, the original line is given as y = 4 - x. Wait, that's the same as y = -x + 4. So the slope here is -1, which makes sense because the problem mentions that the slope is less than zero. The y-intercept of this line is 4, which means it crosses the y-axis at (0, 4). Similarly, the x-intercept is where y = 0, so setting y to 0 gives 0 = -x + 4 â†’ x = 4. That matches the points mentioned in the problem: intercepts at (4,0) and (0,4).

Now, the question says the graph is translated 10 units up. Translating a graph vertically involves adding or subtracting a constant to the entire equation. Since we're moving it up, we add 10 to the y-value. So the original equation y = -x + 4 becomes y = -x + 4 + 10. Simplifying that, it's y = -x + 14. 

The y-intercept of a line in the form y = mx + b is the value of b. In the original equation, b was 4, but after translating up by 10 units, the new equation has b = 14. Therefore, the new y-intercept should be at (0, 14). 

Wait, let me double-check. If you take the original line y = 4 - x and shift it up by 10 units, every point on the line moves up by 10. The y-intercept was originally at (0, 4). Moving that up 10 units would make the new y-intercept (0, 4 + 10) = (0, 14). Yep, that seems correct. 

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe by considering the general translation formula. A vertical translation of a function f(x) by k units upwards results in f(x) + k. So applying that here, the original function f(x) = -x + 4 becomes f(x) + 10 = (-x + 4) + 10 = -x + 14. So again, the y-intercept is 14, hence (0,14).

I don't see any other factors here. The problem didn't mention anything else affecting the translation, like horizontal shifts or reflections. Just a straightforward vertical translation. So the conclusion should be that the new y-intercept is at (0, 14).
