QUESTION:
Write the equation for the piecewise function symmetric to x=3, which goes through (3,0) and (0, 3).

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is asking for the equation of a piecewise function that's symmetric to x=3, passing through (3,0) and (0,3). Hmm. First, I need to recall what symmetry over the line x=3 means. Symmetry with respect to a vertical line like x=a usually involves reflecting points across that line. For example, if a point (x, y) is reflected over x=3, its mirror image would be (6 - x, y). 

Wait, but the function is supposed to be symmetric to x=3. That suggests that the graph of the function is symmetric about the line x=3. So, for every point (x, y) on the function, there should be another point (6 - x, y) also on the function. But since it's a piecewise function, maybe it has different expressions on either side of x=3?

The function needs to go through (3,0) and (0,3). Let me think. If we consider the line x=3 as the axis of symmetry, then the point (0,3) should have a mirror image across x=3. The mirror image of x=0 over x=3 would be x=6, so the mirrored point would be (6,3). But the original function passes through (0,3), so maybe the other part of the piecewise function includes (6,3)? Wait, but the problem states it's symmetric to x=3, so the entire graph is symmetric about that line. Therefore, if (0,3) is on the graph, then (6,3) should also be on the graph. However, the function is defined as going through those two points, so perhaps the function has two parts: one left of x=3 and one right of x=3.

But how do these pieces look? Let's try to sketch mentally. Since it's symmetric about x=3, the function could be made up of two linear pieces. Let's suppose that the function consists of two lines: one for x ≤ 3 and another for x ≥ 3. Each line reflects over x=3.

Alternatively, maybe it's a parabola symmetric about x=3, but the problem mentions it's a piecewise function, not necessarily a single curve. Also, since it passes through (3,0) and (0,3), maybe each piece is a straight line segment.

Let me check the points again. The point (3,0) lies on the line x=3. Then, the point (0,3) is to the left of x=3. Its reflection over x=3 would be at x=6, so (6,3). So, if the function is symmetric about x=3, then (0,3) and (6,3) would both lie on the function. Similarly, if there's a point (a,b) on the function, then (6-a, b) is also on the function.

So, considering the given points, (3,0) is on the line x=3. Let's assume that the function has two segments: one from x=0 to x=3, and another from x=3 onwards. Wait, but (3,0) is the vertex? Or maybe the function crosses x=3 at (3,0). Let me try to find equations for each piece.

For the left side of x=3 (x ≤ 3): Suppose the function passes through (0,3) and (3,0). Let's compute the slope. The slope m would be (0 - 3)/(3 - 0) = -1. So the equation would be y - 3 = -1(x - 0), which simplifies to y = -x + 3. 

Now, for the right side of x=3 (x ≥ 3), due to symmetry about x=3, the function should mirror the left side. So, taking the point (3,0), which is on the axis of symmetry. To find the equation for x ≥ 3, we can reflect the left side. Alternatively, since the function is symmetric, the right side would be a mirror image of the left side. For example, if the left side has a point (x, y), then the right side has (6 - x, y). So, for the right side, if we take x ≥ 3, then the corresponding point on the left side would be 6 - x ≤ 3. Let me see. For instance, when x=3, the point is (3,0). When x=6, the mirrored point would be (0,0) on the left side? Wait, no. Wait, the original left side has (0,3). The mirrored point of (0,3) over x=3 is (6,3). So, the right side would pass through (6,3) and (3,0). Let me check the slope here. The slope between (6,3) and (3,0) is (0 - 3)/(3 - 6) = (-3)/(-3) = 1. So the equation for the right side would be y - 3 = 1*(x - 6), which simplifies to y = x - 3.

Therefore, putting it together, the piecewise function would be:

For x ≤ 3: y = -x + 3

For x ≥ 3: y = x - 3

But wait, does this satisfy the condition of being symmetric about x=3? Let's test a point. Take x=0, y=3. Reflecting over x=3 gives x=6, y=3. Plugging x=6 into the second equation: y = 6 - 3 = 3. Correct. Another point: x=3, y=0. Reflecting gives same point. And for x=1, y=-1 +3=2. The reflection would be x=5, y=2. Plug x=5 into the second equation: y=5-3=2. Correct. So yes, this seems to work.

But the problem says "symmetric to x=3", so this piecewise function is symmetric about x=3, passing through (3,0) and (0,3). Let me confirm if there are any other constraints. The problem didn't mention continuity, but since it's a piecewise function, we need to ensure that at x=3, both sides meet. At x=3, the first equation gives y= -3 +3=0, and the second gives y=3 -3=0. So they meet at (3,0). Perfect.

Thus, the piecewise function is:

f(x) = { -x + 3, when x ≤ 3;
         { x - 3, when x > 3 }

But wait, sometimes piecewise functions include equality in one of the conditions. In this case, since at x=3, both expressions give the same value, we can define it as:

f(x) = -x + 3 for x ≤ 3,
and f(x) = x - 3 for x ≥ 3.

Yes, that works. Now, checking the required points: (3,0) is covered by both, and (0,3) is covered by the first part when x=0. So that's correct.

But let me make sure there isn't another way. Could it be a different type of function? For example, a quadratic function symmetric about x=3? Let's think. A quadratic function symmetric about x=3 would have its vertex at (3, k). But the given points are (3,0) and (0,3). If it were a parabola, then plugging in (0,3) into the standard form y = a(x - 3)^2 + k. At x=0, y=3: 3 = a(0 - 3)^2 + k → 3 = 9a +k. Also, at x=3, y=0: 0 = a(0)^2 + k → k=0. So substituting back, 3 = 9a → a = 1/3. Thus, the equation would be y = (1/3)(x -3)^2. But this is a parabola, not a piecewise function. However, the problem specifies a piecewise function, so likely expecting two linear pieces. Hence, my initial thought is correct.

Another check: the problem mentions "piecewise function symmetric to x=3". So, the function is made of two parts, each part being a line, symmetric about x=3. So the answer should be the combination of those two linear equations.

Hence, the final answer is the piecewise function defined as:

f(x) = 
{
    -x + 3,  x ≤ 3
    x - 3,   x > 3
}

Which can be written in LaTeX as:

f(x) = \begin{cases}
-x + 3 & \text{if } x \leq 3 \\
x - 3 & \text{if } x > 3
\end{cases}

But the problem says "write the equation for the piecewise function...", so maybe they want it in terms of absolute value or something else? Wait, but piecewise is acceptable. Let me check if there's another way. Alternatively, since it's symmetric about x=3, maybe express it as f(x) = |x - 3| - 3? Wait, let's test that. For x ≤ 3, |x-3| = 3 -x, so f(x)=3 -x -3= -x. Wait, but our earlier calculation had y = -x +3. So that doesn't match. Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think.

If the function is symmetric about x=3, then for any x, f(x) = f(6 -x). Let's see. Let's suppose f(x) = |x -3|. Then f(6 -x) = |6 -x -3| = |3 -x| = |x -3| = f(x). So that's symmetric. But then, if we want it to pass through (0,3), then f(0) = |0 -3|=3, which matches. And f(3)=0, which matches (3,0). So the function f(x)=|x -3| would pass through those points and be symmetric about x=3. Wait, but then why is the problem referring to a piecewise function? Because |x -3| is inherently piecewise. It's two linear parts. So the answer could be written as f(x) = |x -3|. But let me check if that satisfies the given points. At x=0, f(0)=3, which is correct. At x=3, f(3)=0. Yes. So is the answer simply f(x) = |x -3|?

But the problem specifically says "piecewise function", which |x -3| is. However, the user might expect writing it explicitly as a piecewise function. But depending on interpretation, maybe the answer is just f(x) = |x - 3|. Let me verify.

But in the problem statement, the user wrote "the equation for the piecewise function symmetric to x=3, which goes through (3,0) and (0,3)". So, if you write f(x) = |x -3|, then it's symmetric about x=3 and passes through those points. But the question says "piecewise function", and absolute value is a piecewise function. So both forms are correct. Which one is expected?

Looking back at the problem, the user might prefer the explicit piecewise definition. But in some contexts, expressing it via absolute value is acceptable. However, since the problem emphasizes "piecewise function", I think the answer expects the piecewise definition. Let me confirm once more.

Original points: (3,0) and (0,3). The absolute value function f(x) = |x - 3| passes through (0,3) because |0-3|=3, and (3,0) because |3-3|=0. So yes. So the equation is f(x) = |x - 3|. But the problem says "symmetric to x=3", which is true for absolute value functions. However, the problem says "piecewise function", which is the same as the absolute value function. So either form is acceptable. But since the user wants the equation, and the answer requires LaTeX, I can present it as either. However, in many cases, the piecewise form is preferred when explicitly asked for a piecewise function.

But looking back at the problem statement, the user said "Write the equation for the piecewise function...". So, if the answer is f(x) = |x - 3|, that's technically correct, but since it's piecewise, maybe the problem expects the explicit piecewise definition. Let me check the initial analysis. Earlier, I found that the function is composed of two linear parts: y = -x + 3 for x ≤ 3 and y = x - 3 for x ≥ 3. So combining these, it's equivalent to |x - 3|. Therefore, both forms are correct. Depending on the desired answer format, but since the problem says "equation", and equations can include absolute values, I think either is acceptable. However, since the problem mentions "piecewise", maybe the answer should show the piecewise structure.

But the system might accept either. Given that, I'll present both possibilities but choose the one that fits best. However, the problem may require the piecewise form. Let me stick with the piecewise version.

Final Answer: The piecewise function is defined as $ f(x) = \begin{cases} -x + 3 & \text{if } x \leq 3 \\ x - 3 & \text{if } x > 3 \end{cases} $

Alternatively, if allowed, $ f(x) = |x - 3| $. But since the problem mentions piecewise, I'll go with the first option.
