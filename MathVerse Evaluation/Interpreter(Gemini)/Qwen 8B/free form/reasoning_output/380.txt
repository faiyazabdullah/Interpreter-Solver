QUESTION:
In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, one leg measuring \sqrt{3}. Find the length of side h.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have a right-angled triangle ABC, where one of the acute angles is 60 degrees, another is 30 degrees since the angles in a triangle add up to 180. Wait, right, because it's a right-angled triangle, so one angle is 90°, then the other two must add up to 90°. Given that one of the acute angles is 60°, the other must be 30°. 

The problem states that the measure of angle at B (Angle(A,B,C)) is 90°, making it the right angle. Then MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C),30) means angle at A is 30°, and MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B),60) would be angle at C is 60°. Wait, no. Let me check again. The Angle(A,B,C) would be angle at point B, between points A, B, C. Since the triangle is right-angled at B, that's the right angle. Then the other angles are at A and C. The MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C),30) is angle at A? Wait, Angle(B,A,C) is angle at A, formed by points B, A, C. So yes, angle at A is 30°, and angle at C is 60°, since they need to add up to 90°. 

Now, the sides: LengthOf(Line(A,B), SqrtOf(3)). So AB has length √3. We need to find the length of Line(B,C), which is denoted as h. 

Since it's a right-angled triangle, maybe we can use trigonometric ratios. In a right-angled triangle, the sine, cosine, tangent of the angles relate the sides. Let me recall. Let's denote the sides opposite to the angles. 

Let me sketch the triangle mentally. Right angle at B. So AB and BC are the legs, and AC is the hypotenuse. Wait, but depending on the labeling. Wait, points A, B, C form a triangle with right angle at B. So AB and BC are the legs, meeting at B. Then AC is the hypotenuse. 

Given that angle at A is 30°, angle at C is 60°, right angle at B. So, in such a triangle, the sides are in the ratio of 1 : √3 : 2. Because in a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides opposite 30°, 60°, and 90° are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. 

Wait, the side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest one. So if angle at A is 30°, then the side opposite to A is BC. Wait, angle at A is 30°, so the side opposite to A is BC. Therefore, BC is opposite angle A, which is 30°, so BC should be the shorter leg. Then AB is adjacent to angle A, so AB is adjacent, which would be the longer leg? Wait, no. Wait, let me think carefully. 

In triangle ABC, right-angled at B. So angle at B is 90°, angle at A is 30°, angle at C is 60°. So:

- Side opposite angle A (30°): BC
- Side opposite angle C (60°): AB
- Hypotenuse: AC

So, in standard terms, for a 30-60-90 triangle, the sides are:

- Opposite 30°: shortest side (let's call it x)
- Opposite 60°: x√3
- Hypotenuse: 2x

But here, angle at A is 30°, so BC is opposite angle A, so BC = x. AB is opposite angle C (which is 60°), so AB = x√3. And hypotenuse AC = 2x.

But in our case, the length of AB is given as √3. Wait, AB is the side opposite angle C (since angle at C is 60°). Wait, AB connects points A and B. Let me confirm:

In triangle ABC, with right angle at B:

- AB is one leg, connecting A to B.
- BC is another leg, connecting B to C.
- AC is hypotenuse.

So angle at A is between AB and AC. Wait, perhaps I need to better assign the sides relative to the angles. 

Alternatively, using trigonometry. Let's consider angle at A is 30°, so tan(angle A) = opposite / adjacent. The angle at A is 30°, so tan(30°) = BC / AB. Since angle A is at vertex A, so the opposite side is BC, and adjacent side is AB. 

Therefore:

tan(30°) = BC / AB

We know AB is √3. So:

tan(30°) = BC / √3

But tan(30°) is 1/√3. Therefore:

1/√3 = BC / √3 → BC = (√3)*(1/√3) = 1. 

Wait, that would make BC = 1. But according to the standard 30-60-90 triangle ratios, if AB is opposite 60°, then AB = x√3, and BC (opposite 30°) is x. Then hypotenuse AC is 2x. So if AB is given as √3, then x√3 = √3 ⇒ x=1. Hence BC = x = 1. Therefore, h = BC = 1. But wait, the problem says "Find the length of side h", where h is the length of line BC. So h = 1?

But let me verify again. Alternatively, maybe I got the sides mixed up. Let me re-examine. 

If angle at A is 30°, then the side opposite to angle A is BC. The side adjacent to angle A is AB. So tan(30°) = BC / AB. As before. If AB is √3, then BC = tan(30°)*AB = (1/√3)*√3 = 1. So BC = 1. Thus h = 1. 

Alternatively, using the standard ratios. Since angle at A is 30°, then the sides are in the ratio 1 : √3 : 2. Where the side opposite 30° (BC) is 1, the side opposite 60° (AB) is √3, and hypotenuse AC is 2. So given AB is √3, which matches the ratio, so BC is 1. Therefore, h = 1. 

But wait, the problem mentions that the triangle is right-angled, and the given data includes MeasureOf(Angle(A,C,B),60). Let me check that angle. Angle(A,C,B) is angle at point C, between points A, C, B. Which is angle at C. So angle at C is 60°, which makes sense. 

Another way: using Pythagoras. Suppose AB = √3, BC = h, and AC is hypotenuse. Then AC² = AB² + BC². Also, knowing the angles, we can find relations. 

But with angles, perhaps it's easier to use trigonometric ratios. Since angle at A is 30°, and AB is adjacent to that angle. 

Alternatively, since it's a right triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. In a 30-60-90 triangle, the hypotenuse is twice the shorter leg. Here, the shorter leg is BC (opposite 30° angle at A), and the longer leg is AB (opposite 60° angle at C). So hypotenuse AC = 2*BC. 

Given AB is longer leg, which is √3. In the ratio, longer leg is x√3, so x√3 = √3 ⇒ x = 1. Therefore, BC = x = 1. Hence h = BC = 1. 

Thus, the length of side h is 1. 

Wait, but maybe there's confusion about which side is which. Let me double-check. 

In triangle ABC, right-angled at B. So AB and BC are legs. 

Angle at A is 30°, so angle between AB and AC. So AB is adjacent to angle A, BC is opposite to angle A. 

Yes, so tan(angle A) = opposite / adjacent = BC / AB. 

Which gives BC = AB * tan(30°) = √3 * (1/√3) = 1. 

Yes, that seems correct. 

Hence, h = 1. 

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming which angle corresponds to which side. Let me check once more. 

If angle at A is 30°, then side BC is opposite angle A, so BC = opposite side. 

Then AB is adjacent to angle A, so AB is the adjacent side. 

Therefore, tan(30) = BC / AB. 

So BC = AB * tan(30) = √3 * (1/√3) = 1. 

Yes. 

Alternatively, using sine. 

sin(angle A) = opposite / hypotenuse. 

So sin(30°) = BC / AC. 

But we don't know AC yet. However, we also know cos(angle A) = adjacent / hypotenuse = AB / AC. 

cos(30°) = AB / AC. 

So AB = √3, so √3 = AC * cos(30°). 

cos(30°) is √3/2. 

Thus, √3 = AC*(√3/2) ⇒ AC = √3 / (√3/2) ) = 2. 

So hypotenuse AC = 2. 

Then, using sin(30°) = BC / AC ⇒ 1/2 = BC / 2 ⇒ BC = 1. 

Same result. 

So regardless of method, BC = 1. Therefore, h = 1. 

Therefore, the answer is 1. 

I think that's solid. All methods converge to BC being 1. So the length of h is 1.
