QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three points: A(-4, 0), B(0, 2), and C(4, 0). They all lie on a curve, and we need to find the domain and range of this function. The domain is given as [-4, 4], but wait, the question says "Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation." Hmm, maybe I need to confirm if that's correct?

First, let me visualize the points. Point A is at (-4, 0), which is on the x-axis. Point B is at (0, 2), so that's straight up on the y-axis. Point C is at (4, 0), again on the x-axis. These three points form a sort of symmetric shape. Since they're on a curve, maybe it's a parabola? Or perhaps a quadratic function?

Wait, since two points are on the x-axis at (-4,0) and (4,0), and one point at (0,2), it seems like a parabola opening downward because it has maximum at (0,2). Let me check. If I assume it's a quadratic function, then the general form would be f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Plugging in the points:

For point A: (-4, 0): 0 = a*(-4)^2 + b*(-4) + c → 16a -4b + c = 0  
For point B: (0, 2): 2 = a*(0)^2 + b*0 + c → c = 2  
For point C: (4, 0): 0 = a*(4)^2 + b*4 + c → 16a +4b + c = 0  

So substituting c=2 into the first equation: 16a -4b + 2 = 0 → 16a -4b = -2  
Second equation after substitution: 16a +4b +2 =0 → 16a +4b = -2  

Now we have two equations:  
1) 16a -4b = -2  
2) 16a +4b = -2  

Let me add these two equations together:  
(16a -4b) + (16a +4b) = -2 + (-2)  
32a = -4 → a = -4 /32 = -1/8  

Then substitute a back into one of the equations. Let's take equation 2:  
16*(-1/8) +4b = -2 → -2 +4b = -2 → 4b = 0 → b=0  

So the quadratic function is f(x) = (-1/8)x² + 0x + 2 → f(x) = - (1/8)x² + 2. 

Now, checking if this makes sense. At x=0, f(0)=2, which matches point B. At x=-4 and x=4, f(-4)= - (1/8)(16) + 2 = -2 +2 =0, same for x=4. Correct. 

So the curve is a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (0,2). Therefore, the domain is all real numbers where the function is defined, but according to the problem statement, the domain is given as [-4,4]. Wait, but why? Because the points given are between -4 and 4. However, if the curve is a parabola, its domain is typically all real numbers unless restricted. But the problem mentions the domain as [-4,4], so maybe the curve is only defined between those x-values? 

But the original problem states that the domain is [-4,4], so maybe that's already given. The question asks to write the domain and range of the function using interval notation. Given that the curve passes through those points and the domain is specified as [-4,4], then the domain is indeed [-4,4]. 

As for the range, since it's a downward-opening parabola with vertex at (0,2), the maximum value is 2, and the minimum occurs at the endpoints x=-4 and x=4, where y=0. So the range would be from 0 up to 2. Hence, the range is [0,2]. 

Therefore, the domain is [-4,4], and the range is [0,2].
