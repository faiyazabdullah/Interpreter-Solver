QUESTION:
Find the volume of the following hemisphere. The radius is 6.

Round your answer to three decimal places.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the volume of a hemisphere where the radius is 6. Let me start by recalling what a hemisphere is. A hemisphere is half of a sphere, right? So if I can figure out the volume of a full sphere and then take half of it, that should give me the volume of the hemisphere.

First, I remember the formula for the volume of a sphere. It's (4/3)πr³. Since a hemisphere is half of that, I think the formula would be (2/3)πr³. Wait, let me make sure. If I divide the sphere's volume by 2, then yes, (4/3)/2 is 2/3. So the hemisphere volume formula is indeed (2/3)πr³.

Now, the radius given here is 6. So substituting r = 6 into the formula. Let me write that down. Volume = (2/3) * π * (6)³. Let me compute 6 cubed first. 6*6 is 36, times 6 is 216. So that part is 216.

Then multiply by 2/3. Let me do that calculation. 216 divided by 3 is 72, then multiplied by 2 gives 144. So the volume is 144π. But wait, the question says to round to three decimal places. Hmm, but π is approximately 3.1415926535... So multiplying 144 by π gives me about 144 * 3.1415926535. Let me calculate that.

Let me do 144 * 3.1416. Well, 144 * 3 = 432. Then 144 * 0.1416. Let's break that down. 0.1 * 144 = 14.4, 0.04 * 144 = 5.76, 0.0016 * 144 = 0.2304. Adding those together: 14.4 + 5.76 = 20.16 + 0.2304 = 20.3904. So total volume is 432 + 20.3904 = 452.3904. Rounded to three decimal places, that would be 452.390. 

Wait, but maybe I should check with more precise calculation. Alternatively, since π is irrational, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach. However, since I'm doing this manually, let me confirm. Alternatively, using a better approximation for π, like 3.14159265. So 144 * π ≈ 144 * 3.14159265. Let me compute that again.

Alternatively, I can note that 144 * π is approximately 144 * 3.14159265 ≈ 452.389342... So rounding to three decimal places, it would be 452.389. Wait, but depending on the exact value of π used, it could vary slightly. However, standard practice is to use π ≈ 3.1416 for such calculations unless specified otherwise. Therefore, 144 * 3.1416 is indeed 452.3904, which rounds to 452.390. But let me verify once more.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in my initial formula. Let me double-check the hemisphere volume formula. Yes, because a sphere's volume is (4/3)πr³, so half of that is (2/3)πr³. Correct. So plugging in r=6, we have (2/3)*π*(6)^3 = (2/3)*π*216 = 144π. So that's correct. Then converting that to a numerical value with π approximated as 3.14159265...

So 144 * π ≈ 144 * 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Well, 100 * π ≈ 314.159265

40 * π ≈ 125.663706

4 * π ≈ 12.5663706

Adding them up: 314.159265 + 125.663706 = 439.822971 + 12.5663706 ≈ 452.3893416. So approximately 452.3893416, which rounds to 452.389 when rounded to three decimal places. Therefore, the final answer should be 452.389.

But wait, the problem mentions "Round your answer to three decimal places." So even though the exact value is 144π, which is an exact form, they want a decimal approximation. Hence, 452.389.

I need to make sure there isn't a miscalculation here. Let me check once again:

(2/3) * π * 6³ = (2/3) * π * 216 = (2 * 216)/3 * π = 432 / 3 * π = 144π. Correct. Then 144π ≈ 452.3893... So yes, 452.389 when rounded to three decimals.

Therefore, the volume of the hemisphere with radius 6 is approximately 452.389 cubic units. Since the problem doesn't specify units, just asks for the number, so the answer is 452.389.
