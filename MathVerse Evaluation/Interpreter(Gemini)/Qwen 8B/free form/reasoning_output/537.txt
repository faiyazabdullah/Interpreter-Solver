QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the period of this trigonometric function based on the given information. So, the problem says there's a graph of a trigonometric function with a maximum point at (π/4, -2.2) and a minimum point at (3π/4, -8.5). We need to find the period.

First, I remember that for trigonometric functions like sine or cosine, the period is the distance between two consecutive points where the function repeats its values. Since they mentioned maximum and minimum points, maybe we can use those to find the period.

Wait, the maximum and minimum points occur at certain intervals. For example, in a standard sine or cosine function, the maxima and minima are separated by half the period. Let me think. If you have a function like y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, the period is 2π / |B|. The maximum and minimum points would be spaced by half the period because one is a peak and the next is a trough. 

So if I can find the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum points, that should be half the period. Then doubling that distance would give the full period. Let me check that logic. Suppose the maximum occurs at x1 and the minimum at x2. The distance between them is (x2 - x1). If that's half the period, then the period is twice that difference.

Looking at the given points: the maximum is at π/4 and the minimum at 3π/4. Let's compute the difference between these x-values. 3π/4 minus π/4 equals 2π/4, which simplifies to π/2. So the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum is π/2. Therefore, if this is half the period, the full period would be π. Wait, but wait—is this always true?

Hold on, maybe it depends on the type of function. For example, in a standard cosine function shifted vertically, the maximum and minimum are indeed separated by half the period. But if the function is transformed, like stretched or compressed horizontally, that would affect the period. However, since the problem mentions it's a periodic function, and gives us specific points, perhaps we can rely on this relationship.

Alternatively, another way to think about it: the distance between two consecutive maxima or two consecutive minima is the period. But here, we have a maximum and then a minimum. So the time between a maximum and the next minimum is half the period. Hence, the total period would be twice the horizontal distance between max and min.

So according to the given points, the horizontal distance between the maximum (π/4) and the minimum (3π/4) is π/2. That suggests that half the period is π/2, so the period is π. Therefore, the period of the function should be π.

But let me make sure there isn't something else I'm missing. Are there other factors that could influence this? For instance, if the function was a tangent or cotangent, but the problem specifies it's a trigonometric function with maxima and minima, which typically implies sine or cosine. Also, the fact that it's periodic is given as a predicate, so we don't need to verify that.

Another check: suppose the period is π. Then, starting from the maximum at π/4, the next maximum would be π/4 + π = 5π/4. Similarly, the minimum would be halfway between two maxima, so between π/4 and 5π/4, the minimum would be at (π/4 + 5π/4)/2 = 6π/4 = 3π/2? Wait, no. Wait, if the period is π, then the distance between a maximum and the next minimum would be half the period, which is π/2. So starting at π/4 (maximum), adding π/2 would get to π/4 + π/2 = 3π/4, which matches the given minimum point. Then the next maximum would be another π/2 after that, which would be 3π/4 + π/2 = 5π/4. So yes, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the horizontal distance between maximum and minimum is π/2, which is half the period, leading to a period of π. So the answer should be π.

Let me also consider if there's another possibility. For example, if the function had a phase shift or vertical shift, would that affect the calculation? No, because the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum points depends only on the horizontal stretching factor, which is directly related to the period. Vertical shifts or reflections won't change the horizontal distances between peaks and troughs. So regardless of the vertical position or reflection, the period can still be determined by the horizontal distance between max and min.

Thus, I feel confident that the period is π.
