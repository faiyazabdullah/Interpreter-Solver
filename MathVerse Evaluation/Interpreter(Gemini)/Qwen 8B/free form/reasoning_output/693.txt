<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the question is about finding the total weight of a glass jar when it's filled with water. The jar is shaped like a cylinder with a given radius and height. The empty jar weighs 250 grams. I need to calculate the total weight when it's filled with water. 

First, I should recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder because the volume will tell me how much water fits inside. The volume of a cylinder is π multiplied by the radius squared times the height. The formula is V = πr²h. Let me make sure that's right... Yeah, radius squared times height times π. Okay.

The radius given here is 15 cm, and the height is 26 cm. Let me plug those numbers into the formula. So, radius squared would be 15 squared, which is 225. Then multiply that by the height, 26. Let me compute 225 * 26 first. Hmm, 225*26. Breaking it down: 200*26=5200 and 25*26=650. Adding them together gives 5200 + 650 = 5850. So then, the volume is π times 5850 cm³. So the volume is 5850π cm³. Wait, but maybe I should check that calculation again? Let me verify 15^2 is indeed 225. Yes, 15*15=225. Then 225*26. Alternatively, 225*20=4500, 225*6=1350, so total 4500+1350=5850. Yep, same result. So Volume = 5850π cm³.

Now, since we're dealing with water, I need to find the mass of the water. But wait, density of water is 1 gram per cubic centimeter. Right? Because 1 cm³ of water weighs 1 gram. So if I can find the volume in cm³, that will directly give me the mass in grams. Therefore, the mass of the water is equal to the volume of the cylinder. So that would be 5850π grams. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me confirm that. The density of water is 1 g/cm³ at standard temperature and pressure. Assuming that the problem is assuming standard conditions, yes. So the mass of the water would be Volume × Density. Since density is 1, it's just the volume. So mass_water = 5850π grams. 

Then, the total weight would be the weight of the empty jar plus the weight of the water. The empty jar is 250 grams. So total weight = 250 + 5850π grams. However, I need to calculate this numerically because they want the answer correct to two decimal places. 

So, I need to compute 5850π. Let me approximate π as 3.1416 or use more decimals? Well, since they want two decimal places, perhaps I should use a precise value of π. Let me use π ≈ 3.1415926536. Let me calculate 5850 multiplied by π. 

Let me do that multiplication. First, 5850 × 3.1415926536. Let me break this down. Maybe compute 5850 × π. Alternatively, note that 5850 × π is approximately 5850 × 3.1416. Let me compute 5850 × 3.1416. Let me do this step by step. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use calculator-like steps here. Let me think:

First, 5850 × π. Let me approximate π as 3.1416. Let me compute 5850 × 3.1416. Let me write this as:

Multiply 5850 by 3.1416. Let me separate the numbers:

Well, 5850 × 3 = 17,550

5850 × 0.1416 = ?

Compute 5850 × 0.1 = 585.0

5850 × 0.04 = 234.0

5850 × 0.0016 = ?

First, 5850 × 0.001 = 5.85, so 5850 × 0.0016 = 5.85 × 1.6 = 9.36

Adding up these components:

For 0.1416, it's 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016. So adding their contributions:

585.0 + 234.0 + 9.36 = 585 + 234 = 819 + 9.36 = 828.36

Therefore, total volume × π is approx 17,550 + 828.36 = 18,378.36 grams?

Wait, no. Wait, that was breaking down the 3.1416 into 3 + 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016. Wait, but actually, the initial breakdown was:

Total multiplier is 3.1416 = 3 + 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016? Wait, 3 + 0.1 is 3.1, then 0.04 makes 3.14, then 0.0016 adds to 3.1416. So yes. Therefore, the total is 5850*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016). Which equals 5850*3 + 5850*0.1 + 5850*0.04 + 5850*0.0016. Which we calculated as 17,550 + 585 + 234 + 9.36. Wait, earlier I said 585.0 + 234.0 + 9.36, but that's only for the 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016 part. Then adding the 17,550 from the 3. So total would be 17,550 + 585 + 234 + 9.36.

Wait, let me recalculate that. Let me redo that part:

Original breakdown:

5850 × 3 = 17,550

Then, 5850 × 0.1 = 585.0

5850 × 0.04 = 234.0

5850 × 0.0016 = 9.36

So adding all those:

17,550 + 585.0 + 234.0 + 9.36

First add 17,550 + 585 = 18,135

Then 18,135 + 234 = 18,369

Then 18,369 + 9.36 = 18,378.36 grams.

So the mass of the water is approximately 18,378.36 grams. 

But wait, is this accurate enough? Let me check with another method. Maybe using calculator approximation. If I have π ≈ 3.14159265, then 5850 × π ≈ ?

Well, 5850 × π ≈ 5850 × 3.14159265. Let me compute that:

First, 5850 × 3 = 17,550

5850 × 0.14159265 = ?

Let me compute 5850 × 0.14159265. Let me break this down further:

0.14159265 is approximately 0.14159265.

So 5850 × 0.14159265 ≈ ?

Let me approximate 0.14159265 as roughly 0.1416. So previous calculation gave us 5850 × 0.1416 ≈ 828.36. But with more precise value, maybe there's a slight difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a better approach. Let me consider that π ≈ 3.14159265, so multiplying 5850 × π:

Let me compute 5850 × π. Let me take π as 3.14159265. Let me compute 5850 × 3.14159265.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use decimal multiplication. Let me write it as follows:

First, note that 5850 × π = 5850 × 3.14159265...

But maybe I can use a calculator-like approach here. However, since I don't have a calculator, perhaps I can use known values. Wait, but maybe my initial estimation was close enough. Let me check.

If I use π ≈ 3.1416, then 5850 × 3.1416 ≈ 18,378.36 grams, as before. But if I use more precise π, say 3.14159265, then the product would be slightly less. Let me see:

The difference between 3.1416 and 3.14159265 is 3.1416 - 3.14159265 = 0.00000735. So the error introduced by using 3.1416 instead of the more precise value is negligible for our purposes. Since we need the answer correct to two decimal places, this level of approximation should suffice. Therefore, proceeding with 18,378.36 grams for the mass of the water.

But let me cross-validate. Another way to calculate 5850 × π is to recognize that π ≈ 22/7, but that's not very accurate. Alternatively, knowing that π ≈ 3.1416, so 5850 × 3.1416. Let me compute 5850 × 3.1416.

Another way: 5850 × 3 = 17550, 5850 × 0.1416 = ?

As before, 5850 × 0.1 = 585, 5850 × 0.04 = 234, 5850 × 0.0016 = 9.36. Summing those gives 585 + 234 + 9.36 = 828.36. So total is 17550 + 828.36 = 18378.36 grams. So that seems consistent.

So the mass of the water is approximately 18,378.36 grams. Now, adding the mass of the empty jar, which is 250 grams. Therefore, total weight is 250 + 18,378.36 = 18,628.36 grams.

Wait, but let me check once again. Is the volume correctly calculated? Radius 15 cm, height 26 cm. Volume is πr²h = π×15²×26. As computed, that's π×225×26 = π×5850. Correct. Then, mass of water is 5850π grams. Then, converting that with π≈3.1416 gives 5850×3.1416≈18,378.36 grams. Then adding 250 grams gives total weight as 18,378.36 + 250 = 18,628.36 grams. 

But wait, the problem says "correct to 2 decimal places." So 18,628.36 grams is already to two decimal places. But let me check whether my approximation of π was sufficient. Suppose I used more precise π, would that change the second decimal place?

Let me compute 5850 × π with higher precision. Let me recall that π ≈ 3.141592653589793...

So let me compute 5850 × π:

First, compute 5850 × 3.141592653589793.

Breaking down:

We can note that 5850 × π = 5850 × 3.141592653589793.

But without actual computation tools, it's hard, but maybe we can estimate the difference between 3.1416 and the true value. The difference between 3.1416 and π is about 3.1416 - π ≈ 3.1416 - 3.14159265 ≈ 0.00000735. Therefore, the error in using 3.1416 instead of the actual π is 5850 × 0.00000735 ≈ 5850 × 0.00000735. Let me calculate that:

First, 5850 × 0.00000735 = 5850 × 7.35e-6.

Which is 5850 × 7.35 / 1,000,000.

Calculating numerator: 5850 × 7.35. Let me compute 5850 × 7 = 40,950; 5850 × 0.35 = 5850 × 0.3 + 5850 × 0.05 = 1,755 + 292.5 = 2,047.5. Total is 40,950 + 2,047.5 = 42,997.5. Then divide by 1,000,000: 42,997.5 / 1,000,000 = 0.0429975 grams. So the error is approximately 0.043 grams. So if I had used π as 3.14159265..., then the actual value would be 18,378.36 - 0.043 ≈ 18,378.317 grams. 

So when I added 250 grams, the total would be 18,378.317 + 250 = 18,628.317 grams. Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 18,628.32 grams. Whereas my original approximation gave 18,628.36 grams. So there is a small discrepancy due to the approximation of π. 

Since the problem asks for the answer correct to two decimal places, I need to ensure that my calculation is precise enough. To do that, perhaps I should carry out the multiplication with more accurate π value. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use fractions. Wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, use more decimal places for π. Let me try using π ≈ 3.1415926536. Let me recompute 5850 × π with this value.

So π ≈ 3.1415926536. Let me compute 5850 × 3.1415926536.

Let me write this as:

First, compute 5850 × 3 = 17,550.

Next, compute 5850 × 0.1415926536.

Let me compute 0.1415926536 × 5850.

To compute this, note that 0.1 × 5850 = 585.0

0.04 × 5850 = 234.0

0.0015926536 × 5850.

Let me compute 0.001 × 5850 = 5.85

0.0005926536 × 5850.

Compute 0.0005 × 5850 = 2.925

0.0000926536 × 5850 ≈ ?

Well, 0.0000926536 × 5850 ≈ 0.0000926536 × 5000 + 0.0000926536 × 850.

Approximately 0.463268 + 0.078755 ≈ 0.542023.

So adding up:

From 0.001: 5.85

From 0.0005: 2.925 → total so far 5.85 + 2.925 = 8.775

Then from 0.0000926536: ~0.542 → total ≈ 8.775 + 0.542 ≈ 9.317

Thus, the contribution from 0.1415926536 is 585 + 234 + 9.317 ≈ 585 + 234 = 819 + 9.317 = 828.317 grams.

Therefore, total volume × π is 17,550 + 828.317 = 18,378.317 grams.

Adding the mass of the jar, 250 grams, gives total weight as 18,378.317 + 250 = 18,628.317 grams. Rounding this to two decimal places, it would be 18,628.32 grams.

However, depending on the exact value of π used, there could be minor variations. But since the problem requires two decimal places, and considering that even with more precise calculation, the third decimal may vary, but the second decimal would be either .31 or .32. 

But how precise are we supposed to be? In exams or problems, unless specified, sometimes you're told to use π ≈ 3.14 or π ≈ 22/7. However, since the problem mentions "correct to 2 decimal places," likely expecting a precise calculation. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the exact value of π and compute it more accurately. Let me try using more precise steps. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that π ≈ 3.141592653589793. Let me compute 5850 × π:

Using a calculator (pretending I have one), 5850 × π ≈ 5850 × 3.141592653589793 ≈ let's compute:

First, 5850 × 3 = 17,550.

Then, 5850 × 0.141592653589793.

Let me compute 0.141592653589793 × 5850.

Again, breaking down:

Let me think of this as 5850 × (0.1 + 0.04 + 0.001592653589793).

So:

5850 × 0.1 = 585

5850 × 0.04 = 234

5850 × 0.001592653589793 ≈ ?

Well, 0.001592653589793 × 5850 ≈ ?

Let me compute 0.001 × 5850 = 5.85

Then 0.000592653589793 × 5850 ≈ ?

That's approximately 5850 × 0.00059265 ≈ 5850 × 0.0006 = 3.51 minus 5850 × (0.0006 - 0.00059265) = 5850 × 0.00000735 ≈ 5850 × 0.00000735 ≈ 0.043 grams.

So approximately 3.51 - 0.043 = 3.467 grams.

So total for 0.00159265... is 5.85 + 3.467 ≈ 9.317 grams.

Therefore, total for 0.141592... is 585 + 234 + 9.317 = 828.317 grams.

Hence, total volume × π is 17,550 + 828.317 = 18,378.317 grams. 

Adding the jar's weight: 18,378.317 + 250 = 18,628.317 grams. Rounded to two decimal places, this is 18,628.32 grams. 

But let me check once more. If I use a calculator, 5850 × π is approximately:

Let me use a calculator (pretend). For example, 5850 × π ≈ 5850 × 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Well, 5850 × 3 = 17,550. 

Now, 5850 × 0.14159265 = ?

Let me compute 5850 × 0.1 = 585.0

5850 × 0.04 = 234.0

5850 × 0.00159265 = ?

As above, around 9.317. 

So total is 585 + 234 + 9.317 = 828.317. 

Adding to 17,550 gives 18,378.317 grams. 

Thus, total weight is 18,378.317 + 250 = 18,628.317 grams. 

Rounded to two decimal places, since the third decimal is 7, which is ≥5, so round up the second decimal. 

Wait, the value is 18,628.317 grams. So written as 18,628.32 grams when rounded to two decimal places. 

But let me check if there's any other rounding that needs to happen. For instance, during intermediate steps. 

But since the problem specifies to correct to two decimal places, and given that the exact value is approximately 18,628.317 grams, which rounds to 18,628.32 grams. 

But let me also check if I made any mistake in calculations earlier. For example, did I correctly compute the volume?

Yes, radius 15 cm, height 26 cm. Volume is πr²h = π*(15)^2*26 = π*225*26 = π*5850. Correct. 

Mass of water is 5850π grams. Correct. 

Adding the jar's mass of 250 grams. Correct. 

So, total weight is 250 + 5850π grams. 

Now, if I were to use more precise π, like 3.1415926535, then the exact value would be 5850 × π ≈ 18,378.317 grams. 

But in some cases, people might use different approximations for π. For example, if someone uses π ≈ 3.1416, then 5850 × 3.1416 = 18,378.36 grams. Hence, total weight would be 18,378.36 + 250 = 18,628.36 grams. Depending on the approximation, the second decimal can differ. 

But since the problem says "correct to 2 decimal places", I need to ensure that the answer is accurate. How can I resolve this discrepancy? Perhaps I need to perform the calculation with more precise steps. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the exact fractional representation. Wait, but that's complicated. 

Alternatively, think of π as 22/7, but that's not accurate. However, let me check what happens with π ≈ 22/7. 

π ≈ 22/7 ≈ 3.142857. Then, 5850 × 22/7 = ?

Compute 5850 × 22 ÷ 7. 

First, compute 5850 × 22 = ?

Well, 5850 × 20 = 117,000; 5850 × 2 = 11,700. Total is 117,000 + 11,700 = 128,700. Then divide by 7: 128,700 ÷ 7 ≈ 18,385.714 grams. 

This would give total weight as 18,385.714 + 250 = 18,635.714 grams. Which is significantly different. But since π is approximately 3.1416, which is less than 22/7, this suggests that using 22/7 overestimates the value. So this shows that the approximation of π affects the result. 

Therefore, to get the most accurate result, we need to use a sufficiently accurate value of π. Given that, let me try using more decimal places for π. 

Suppose I take π ≈ 3.141592653589793. Then:

Calculate 5850 × π:

Let me use the value of π as 3.141592653589793.

Multiplying 5850 × π:

Breakdown:

First, 5850 × 3 = 17,550.

Then, 5850 × 0.141592653589793.

Let me compute this part precisely.

Let me denote x = 0.141592653589793.

Compute 5850 × x.

Let me express x as 0.141592653589793.

Let me approximate this as follows:

Note that 0.141592653589793 = 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.001592653589793.

Earlier computations showed that this leads to 585 + 234 + ~9.317 = 828.317.

But to get more precise, let me use more accurate calculation for 0.001592653589793 × 5850.

Let me compute 0.001592653589793 × 5850.

First, note that 0.001 × 5850 = 5.85.

Then, 0.000592653589793 × 5850.

Let me compute 0.0005 × 5850 = 2.925.

Then, 0.000092653589793 × 5850.

Let me compute this as 0.000092653589793 × 5850 ≈ ?

Let me approximate this as 0.00009265 × 5850 = ?

Well, 0.00009 × 5850 = 0.5265

And 0.00000265 × 5850 = 0.015495

Total ≈ 0.5265 + 0.015495 ≈ 0.541995.

So total for 0.00059265... is 2.925 + 0.541995 ≈ 3.466995.

Therefore, total for 0.00159265... is 5.85 + 3.466995 ≈ 9.316995.

Therefore, the total for x = 0.14159265... is 585 + 234 + 9.316995 = 585 + 234 = 819 + 9.316995 = 828.316995 grams.

Thus, total volume × π is 17,550 + 828.316995 = 18,378.316995 grams.

Adding the jar's weight: 18,378.316995 + 250 = 18,628.316995 grams.

Now, rounding this to two decimal places: look at the third decimal place, which is 6 (since 18,628.316995 is ...316...). So, the number is 18,628.316995... which is 18,628.31 (dollars?) No, grams. So, 18,628.316995 grams. 

When rounding to two decimal places, we look at the third decimal digit. Here, it's 6, which is greater than or equal to 5, so we round up the second decimal place. 

The current value is 18,628.316995... So, the integer part is 18,628, then decimal part is 0.316995...

So, writing as 18,628.316995... grams. Rounded to two decimal places:

Look at the first decimal: 3, second: 1, third: 6. So, round up the second decimal: 1 becomes 2. Thus, 18,628.32 grams. 

Therefore, the total weight is 18,628.32 grams. 

But let me check if there's any other consideration. For example, does the problem mention anything about significant figures? It says "correct to 2 decimal places", so it's about decimal precision, not significant figures. 

Therefore, based on precise calculation, the answer is 18,628.32 grams. 

But to double-check, let me consider using another approach. For example, using the exact value of π and performing the multiplication with more precise steps. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the calculator function here. Wait, since I'm simulating thinking process, maybe I can accept that with π ≈ 3.14159265, the value is approximately 18,628.32 grams. 

Thus, the final answer is 18,628.32 grams. 

But wait, let me check once again. What if I use a calculator for 5850 × π?

Assuming I have access to a calculator, 5850 × π = ?

Let me compute 5850 × π. 

Well, π is approximately 3.141592653589793. Multiply by 5850:

Let me compute this as follows:

Take 5850 × π = ?

Well, 5850 × π ≈ 5850 × 3.141592653589793 ≈ let's compute this step by step.

Let me note that 5850 × π ≈ 5850 × 3.141592653589793 ≈ 18378.317 grams (as previously calculated). 

So, adding the 250 grams gives 18378.317 + 250 = 18628.317 grams, which rounds to 18628.32 grams. 

Thus, the final answer is 18,628.32 grams. 

But to present this properly, the question says to put the final answer in proper LaTeX format. Also, they mentioned that measurements should include units. Wait, the problem says "calculate its total weight when it is filled with water, correct to 2 decimal places." The units are grams, since the jar's weight is given in grams. 

Therefore, the final answer is 18,628.32 grams. 

But let me check once again if I made any miscalculations in the steps. For example, verifying the volume calculation:

Volume = πr²h = π*(15)^2*26 = π*225*26 = π*5850. Correct. 

Yes. 

Mass of water = Volume * density = 5850π grams. Correct. 

Total weight = 250 + 5850π. Correct. 

Yes. 

So, yes, the answer is 250 + 5850π grams ≈ 18,628.32 grams. 

Thus, the final answer in LaTeX would be \boxed{18628.32} grams. 

Wait, but the
