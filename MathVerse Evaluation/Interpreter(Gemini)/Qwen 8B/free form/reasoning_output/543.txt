MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the formula for a trigonometric function f(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d, given that it has a maximum point at (-2, -3) and a minimum point at (-2.5, -9). 

First, I remember that for a cosine function of the form f(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d, the midline is y = d, which is the average of the maximum and minimum values. Also, the amplitude is half the difference between the maximum and minimum. Let me start by finding these parameters.

The maximum value is at y = -3, and the minimum is at y = -9. Wait, so the maximum is higher than the minimum? But since the maximum is at y=-3 and the minimum at y=-9, that means the midline should be halfway between these two points. Let me calculate that. 

Midline (d) would be (max + min)/2. Plugging in the numbers: (-3 + (-9))/2 = (-12)/2 = -6. So d = -6. That makes sense because the midline is horizontal line halfway between max and min.

Next, the amplitude (a) is half the distance between the max and min. Since the max is higher than the min, the amplitude is |(max - min)| / 2. Wait, but here the max is -3 and the min is -9. So the vertical distance between them is (-3) - (-9) = 6. Therefore, amplitude a = 6 / 2 = 3. However, wait, since the maximum is at y=-3, which is above the midline y=-6, the amplitude should be positive. So a is 3. But actually, the amplitude is always a positive number, so regardless of direction, the magnitude is 3. But depending on the phase shift, the sign might change. Hmm, but maybe I should check later.

Now, the next part is figuring out the period and frequency. To do that, we need to know the distance between the maximum and minimum points. Wait, but in a standard cosine function, the distance between a maximum and the next minimum is half the period. Wait, no. Let me recall: the distance between a maximum and the adjacent minimum is half the period. Because from maximum to minimum is half a period. So if we can find the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum points, that would give us half the period. 

But here, the maximum is at x = -2, and the minimum is at x = -2.5. Wait, so the horizontal distance between them is |-2.5 - (-2)| = |-0.5| = 0.5 units. So that's half the period. Therefore, the full period T is twice that, so 1.0 units. Then, the period T = 2π / b, so solving for b: b = 2π / T. Since T is 1, then b = 2π. Wait, but let me confirm. If the distance between max and min is half-period, then yes, T = 2*(distance between max and min). So T = 2*0.5 = 1. Hence, b = 2π / T = 2π / 1 = 2π. So b is 2π. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Suppose the function is f(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d. The maximum occurs where bx + c = 0 (since cosine is maximum at 0), and the minimum occurs where bx + c = π (since cosine is minimum at π). So the difference in x-values between the maximum and minimum would correspond to the difference in the argument of cosine being π. So if we have two points, one at x_max and x_min, such that:

At x_max: b*x_max + c = 0  
At x_min: b*x_min + c = π  

Subtracting these equations gives: b*(x_max - x_min) = -π  
So, x_max - x_min = -π / b  
But the actual horizontal distance between x_max and x_min is x_min - x_max (since x_min < x_max?), Wait, in our case, the maximum is at x = -2, and the minimum is at x = -2.5. So x_min is -2.5, which is less than x_max = -2. So the horizontal distance between them is x_max - x_min = (-2) - (-2.5) = 0.5. So according to the previous equation:

x_max - x_min = -π / b  
Which would mean 0.5 = -π / b → b = -π / 0.5 = -2π. But b is usually taken as positive in the standard form, so perhaps there's a phase shift involved. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in signs here. Let me re-examine.

Let me denote the maximum at x = -2 and the minimum at x = -2.5. So moving from the maximum to the minimum, the x-value decreases by 0.5 units. So the horizontal distance between maximum and minimum is Δx = x_min - x_max = (-2.5) - (-2) = -0.5. Wait, but the time between max and min is half the period. However, since the function goes from max to min, it's moving leftward? Or how does the cosine function behave?

Actually, the standard cosine function starts at maximum at x=0, then goes down to minimum at x=π, then back up. So the time between max and min is half the period. But in our case, the x-values are decreasing: from x = -2 (max) to x = -2.5 (min). So the horizontal distance between them is negative. Which suggests that the function is shifting left or right?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the general form. Let's suppose that the maximum occurs at x = -2, so let's set up the equation for the maximum. At x = -2, the function reaches its maximum. Similarly, at x = -2.5, it reaches the minimum. 

For the standard cosine function, the maximum occurs when the argument of the cosine is 0. So, if we have f(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d, then the maximum occurs when bx + c = 2πk for integer k. Similarly, the minimum occurs when bx + c = π + 2πk. 

Assuming that the first maximum is at x = -2, and the next minimum is at x = -2.5. Let's take the first maximum at x = -2 and the first minimum at x = -2.5. So between those two points, the argument of cosine increases by π (from 0 to π). Therefore, the change in the argument is π, which equals b*(Δx). Here, Δx is x_min - x_max = (-2.5) - (-2) = -0.5. So:

Change in argument = b*(Δx) = π  
=> b*(-0.5) = π  
=> b = π / (-0.5) = -2π. 

But typically, we prefer to write b as a positive value. So, maybe we can adjust the phase shift accordingly. Let's note that b can be negative, but it's more common to express it as positive by adjusting the phase shift. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me check again.

If the maximum occurs at x = -2, then:

bx + c = 0 ⇒ b*(-2) + c = 0 ⇒ c = 2b.

Similarly, at the minimum x = -2.5:

bx + c = π ⇒ b*(-2.5) + c = π.

Substituting c = 2b into this equation:

b*(-2.5) + 2b = π ⇒ (-2.5b + 2b) = π ⇒ (-0.5b) = π ⇒ b = -2π.

So indeed, b = -2π. But since cosine is even, cos(-θ) = cos θ, so we could also represent the function with a positive b by adjusting the phase shift. However, in the standard form, b is positive, so perhaps we can rewrite the function as f(x) = a cos(-2πx + c') + d, which simplifies to a cos(2πx - c') + d. But the phase shift would be different. However, for the purposes of writing the formula, the value of b can be negative, but sometimes problems expect positive coefficients. Maybe I need to proceed with b = -2π, but let's see if that works.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming the direction of the phase shift. Let me think differently. Let's instead find the phase shift. 

We can write the function as f(x) = a cos(b(x - h)) + d, where h is the phase shift. However, the given form is a cos(bx + c) + d. Expanding this, it's equivalent to a cos(bx + c) + d = a cos[b(x + c/b)] + d. So the phase shift is -c/b. 

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the phase shift once we have other parameters. 

But perhaps another way: Once we know the midline, amplitude, and period, we can figure out the phase shift. Let me recap the parameters we found so far:

Amplitude a = 3 (but wait, earlier calculation said the vertical difference was 6, so amplitude is 3. But since the maximum is at y=-3 and the midline is at y=-6, then the amplitude is 3, so the function oscillates around y=-6 with amplitude 3. So the maximum is midline + amplitude, which is -6 + 3 = -3, correct. Minimum is midline - amplitude: -6 - 3 = -9, which matches. So that's confirmed. 

Period T = 1, so b = 2π / T = 2π / 1 = 2π. Wait, earlier calculation suggested b = -2π. This seems conflicting. Where is the discrepancy?

Ah! The confusion comes from the direction of the phase shift. Let me clarify. The period is determined by the horizontal distance between the maximum and minimum. Earlier, the horizontal distance between the maximum at x=-2 and the minimum at x=-2.5 is 0.5 units. Since this is half the period, the full period is 1. Hence, the period T = 1. Therefore, b = 2π / T = 2π. 

But earlier, when trying to relate the arguments of cosine, I got b = -2π. How to resolve this contradiction?

Perhaps because the function is decreasing from the maximum to the minimum, which implies that the coefficient b is negative. Let me think about the derivative. The slope of the function at the maximum is zero, then becomes negative (since after the maximum, the function decreases). So the function is decreasing from the maximum to the minimum. Therefore, the coefficient b should be negative. 

Wait, but if the period is T = 1, then b = 2π / T = 2π. But if the function is decreasing from max to min, that would require the cosine function to be decreasing over that interval. However, normally, the standard cosine function increases then decreases, but with a negative b, it would flip the direction. 

Let me think again. Suppose we have a function like f(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d. If b is positive, then as x increases, the argument bx + c increases, leading to the cosine wave going through its cycle. If b is negative, then increasing x would decrease the argument, making the cosine wave go backward. 

In our case, from x=-2 (maximum) to x=-2.5 (minimum), as x decreases (moving left), the function decreases. Wait, no. From x=-2 to x=-2.5, x is moving leftwards (since -2.5 is further left). So, the function is decreasing as x moves from -2 to -2.5. So the function is decreasing when x increases from -2.5 to -2? No, if you move from x=-2.5 to x=-2, x increases, and the function goes from minimum to maximum, i.e., increases. So between x=-2.5 and x=-2, the function increases. Thus, the function is increasing as x increases from -2.5 to -2. That would imply that the derivative is positive in that interval. 

For a cosine function, the derivative is -b sin(bx + c). So if the function is increasing at that interval, then the derivative should be positive. Let me check. 

Suppose we're at x=-2.5, which is the minimum point. The derivative there is zero. Moving towards x=-2, the function increases, so the derivative is positive. So, the derivative is positive in that region. So:

At x=-2.5, the derivative is zero (minimum). As x approaches -2, derivative becomes positive. 

Let me plug into derivative:

f'(x) = -b sin(bx + c)

At x=-2.5, the derivative is zero. So:

-b sin(b*(-2.5) + c) = 0 ⇒ sin(b*(-2.5) + c) = 0. So, the argument of sine is kπ for some integer k. Let's assume k=0 for the first minimum. So:

b*(-2.5) + c = 0 ⇒ c = 2.5b.

Also, at the maximum point x=-2, the derivative is zero (since it's a maximum). So:

-b sin(b*(-2) + c) = 0 ⇒ sin(b*(-2) + c) = 0.

Substituting c = 2.5b:

sin(-2b + 2.5b) = sin(0.5b) = 0 ⇒ 0.5b = kπ. 

Since we want the first maximum after the minimum, likely k=1. So:

0.5b = π ⇒ b = 2π.

Wait, this contradicts the earlier conclusion that b was -2π. What's happening here?

Let me re-express this. If we have the first minimum at x=-2.5, then the next maximum is at x=-2. The time between minimum and maximum is half the period. So the horizontal distance between them is x_max - x_min = (-2) - (-2.5) = 0.5. Which is half the period. So the period T = 1, hence b = 2π / T = 2π. 

Therefore, this suggests that b = 2π. Then, substituting back into the earlier equation from the minimum point:

From the minimum at x=-2.5, we had c = 2.5b. With b = 2π, c = 2.5 * 2π = 5π. 

Then, checking the maximum at x=-2:

Argument of cosine is bx + c = 2π*(-2) + 5π = -4π + 5π = π. So cos(π) = -1, which gives the minimum value. Wait, but that's supposed to be the maximum. Wait, this is confusing. 

Hold on, if the argument at x=-2 is π, then cos(π) = -1, which would make the function f(x) = a*cos(...)+d = a*(-1) + d. But we wanted this to be the maximum. Wait, this suggests something is wrong. 

Wait, the maximum occurs when the cosine term is at its maximum, which is 1. So, we need the argument at x=-2 to be 0 (mod 2π), not π. So why did we get π here?

Because earlier, I assumed that at the minimum, the argument is π, and at the maximum, it's 0. But if we have the function decreasing from max to min, then the argument should increase from 0 to π. But with b positive, increasing x would increase the argument. However, in our case, the maximum is at x=-2, and the minimum is at x=-2.5 (which is to the left of x=-2). So moving from x=-2.5 to x=-2 (increasing x), the argument of the cosine increases from π to 0 mod 2π? Wait, that doesn't seem right. 

Wait, if the function is decreasing from x=-2.5 to x=-2, then the argument of the cosine must be decreasing. Because the function is decreasing, so the derivative is negative. Wait, earlier we saw that the derivative at x=-2.5 is zero (minimum), then as x increases toward -2, the function increases, so derivative is positive. Therefore, the derivative is positive in that interval, which would mean that -b sin(...) is positive. So sin(...) must be negative. 

This is getting too tangled. Perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me try to define the function with the known parameters.

We have the midline d = -6, amplitude a = 3. Now, we need to find b and c. 

The period T = 1, so b = 2π / T = 2π. 

Now, the phase shift. The standard cosine function is shifted horizontally. The general form is f(x) = a cos(b(x - h)) + d, where h is the horizontal shift. But we can also write it as f(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d, where c = -bh. 

Alternatively, since we have the maximum at x=-2, which corresponds to the standard cosine function's maximum at x=h. So, for the standard cosine function, the maximum is at x = h. So, comparing to our function, the maximum occurs at x = -2. Therefore, h = -2. Hence, the function can be written as:

f(x) = a cos(b(x + 2)) + d.

Expanding this, it's a cos(bx + 2b) + d. Comparing with the original form, c = 2b. 

But we already found that b = 2π. So c = 2b = 4π. 

Thus, the function is f(x) = 3 cos(2πx + 4π) - 6. 

However, cos(θ + 2π) = cosθ, so this can be simplified to f(x) = 3 cos(2πx) - 6. 

But wait, let's test this. At x = -2, plugging into the function:

f(-2) = 3 cos(2π*(-2)) -6 = 3 cos(-4π) -6 = 3 cos(4π) -6 = 3*1 -6 = -3, which matches the maximum point. 

At x = -2.5:

f(-2.5) = 3 cos(2π*(-2.5)) -6 = 3 cos(-5π) -6 = 3 cos(5π) -6 = 3*(-1) -6 = -3 -6 = -9, which matches the minimum. Perfect!

So the function is f(x) = 3 cos(2πx) - 6. 

But wait, the problem says "the function has a maximum point at (-2, -3)" and "minimum point at (-2.5, -9)". According to this function, the maximum occurs at x=-2, which is correct. And the minimum occurs at x=-2.5, which is also correct. 

But why didn't the earlier attempt with phase shift account for the negative b? Because when we considered the horizontal shift, we directly used the position of the maximum to determine h, leading to a positive b. 

So the correct formula is f(x) = 3 cos(2πx) - 6. 

But let me double-check the period. The period is 2π / b = 2π / (2π) = 1. Correct. The distance between max and min is half the period, which is 0.5, matching the horizontal distance between x=-2 and x=-2.5. 

Another check: the function has a period of 1, so it repeats every 1 unit. So the maximum at x=-2 would repeat at x=-1, 0, 1, etc. But the minimum would be at x=-2.5, -1.5, -0.5, etc. 

Yes, this seems consistent. 

But let me verify with another point. Let's pick x=-2.5: 

As before, f(-2.5) = 3 cos(2π*(-2.5)) -6 = 3 cos(-5π) -6 = 3 cos(5π) -6 = 3*(-1) -6 = -3 -6 = -9. Correct. 

And x=-1.5: 

f(-1.5) = 3 cos(2π*(-1.5)) -6 = 3 cos(-3π) -6 = 3 cos(3π) -6 = 3*(-1) -6 = -3 -6 = -9. So that's a minimum point at x=-1.5. Which is consistent with the pattern. 

So this seems to work. 

Therefore, the formula is f(x) = 3 cos(2πx) - 6. 

Wait, but in this case, the phase shift is zero, because the function is just shifted horizontally by h=-2, but since the period is 1, the horizontal shift affects the overall shape. 

But according to the derivation, the function is f(x) = 3 cos(2π(x + 2)) -6. Which expands to 3 cos(2πx + 4π) -6. Since cos(θ + 2π) = cosθ, this simplifies to 3 cos(2πx) -6. 

So the phase shift cancels out due to periodicity. Hence, the final answer is f(x) = 3 cos(2πx) -6. 

But let me check if there's another possibility. For example, if there was a different phase shift. Suppose the function had a phase shift that caused the same behavior. But given the maximum and minimum points, the simplest form is achieved with b=2π and c=4π, which reduces to no phase shift. 

Hence, the correct answer is f(x) = 3 cos(2πx) -6. 

But let me check if the amplitude is correctly accounted for. The amplitude is 3, so the vertical stretch is 3. Midline is -6. Yes, which gives the max at -6 + 3 = -3 and min at -6 -3 = -9. All checks out. 

Therefore, the final formula is f(x) = 3 cos(2πx) -6.
