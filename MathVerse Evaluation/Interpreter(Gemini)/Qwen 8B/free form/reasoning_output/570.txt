QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a scaled version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two functions, f and g. The problem says that f is a parabola represented by y = x², and g is a scaled version of f. We need to find the equation for g(x). 

First, I should recall what it means for a function to be a scaled version of another. Scaling usually involves vertical or horizontal stretches or compressions. Since the original function f is y = x², scaling could affect either the x or y direction. But since they mention it's a scaled version, maybe there's a vertical scaling factor involved. Wait, but sometimes scaling can also involve horizontal scaling. Let me think.

The problem mentions that g is a scaled version of f. In mathematics, when you scale a function vertically, you multiply the output by a constant. For example, if you have y = kx², that's a vertical stretch or compression depending on k. Alternatively, horizontal scaling would involve replacing x with x/a, leading to y = (x/a)², which simplifies to y = x²/a². But the problem doesn't specify whether it's vertical or horizontal scaling. However, since the question asks for the equation of g(x), and given that the original function is y = x², perhaps the scaling is vertical? Or maybe there's more information in the given predicates that can help us figure out the scaling factor.

Looking back at the given predicates. There's a point P at (2,3). Also, the origin is (0,0), and P lies on line g. Wait, no—the PointLiesOnShape(P, g) is mentioned. So point P (which is (2,3)) lies on the shape g. Since f and g are both parabolas, and f is y = x². So g is a scaled version of f. Therefore, the general form of a scaled parabola could be y = ax² + bx + c. But since it's a scaling of f(x) = x², maybe it's just a vertical scaling, so y = kx². Or maybe horizontal scaling, like y = (x - h)² + k, but since the origin is on both f and g, maybe there's some shift?

Wait, the origin lies on both f and g. For f, which is y = x², substituting (0,0) gives 0 = 0², which holds. So for g, which is a scaled version of f, if it's a vertical scaling, then the equation would be y = kx². Plugging in the origin (0,0): 0 = k*(0)² → 0=0, which works regardless of k. So that's consistent. Now, since point P (2,3) lies on g. So plugging x=2 into g's equation, we get y = k*(2)² = 4k. But the y-coordinate is 3, so 4k = 3 → k = 3/4. Hence, the equation of g would be y = (3/4)x². 

But wait, the problem says "scaled version". Is there any other way scaling could be applied? Like horizontal scaling? If it's a horizontal scaling, say replacing x with x/a, then the equation becomes y = (x/a)². Then, plugging in the point P (2,3): 3 = (2/a)² → 4/a² = 3 → a² = 4/3 → a = 2/sqrt(3). But then the equation would be y = (x / (2/sqrt(3)))² = (sqrt(3)/2 x)² = (3/4)x². Which is the same result as before! So regardless of whether it's a vertical or horizontal scaling, in this case, the resulting equation ends up being y = (3/4)x². Because horizontal scaling affects the x-component, but when you square it, it's equivalent to a vertical scaling. Wait, actually, horizontal scaling by a factor of 'a' is equivalent to vertical scaling by a factor of 1/a². So in this case, if you horizontally scale by 2/sqrt(3), then the vertical scaling factor would be (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4. Hence, the equation ends up the same. 

Therefore, regardless of the direction of scaling, the final equation for g(x) is y = (3/4)x². 

Let me check again. Suppose g is a vertical scaling of f. Then, since f(x) = x², g(x) = kx². Then, point (2,3) is on g, so 3 = k*(2)^2 → k = 3/4. So equation is y = (3/4)x². 

Alternatively, if it's a horizontal scaling, then g(x) = (x/a)^2. Then, plug in (2,3): 3 = (2/a)^2 → a = 2/sqrt(3). So the equation is y = (x/(2/sqrt(3)))^2 = (sqrt(3)/2 x)^2 = (3/4)x². Same result. So regardless of the type of scaling, the equation is the same. 

So the answer is y = (3/4)x², which can be written as g(x) = (3/4)x². 

Now, checking the given predicates again. The function Value(f, x, Pow(x,2)) is given, which confirms that f is y = x². The PointLiesOnShape(P, g) implies that (2,3) is on g, which we used to find k. 

Hence, the equation for g is y = (3/4)x². Therefore, the answer should be g(x) = (3/4)x².
