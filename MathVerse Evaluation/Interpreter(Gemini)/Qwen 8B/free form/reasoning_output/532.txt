QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the midline equation of the function? Give an exact expression.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the midline equation of a trigonometric function based on given points. Let me start by recalling what I know about trigonometric functions and their graphs.

First, the midline of a trigonometric function, like sine or cosine, is the horizontal line that runs through the middle of the function's oscillations. It's essentially the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function. That makes sense because the function oscillates around this line. 

The problem states that there's a minimum point at (-π/2, 2.4) and a maximum point at (3π/2, 13). Wait, hold on, the x-coordinates here are in terms of π, but the y-values are numerical. So, these points are on the graph of the function. Since it's a trigonometric function, likely a sine or cosine wave, we need to find the midline, which would be the horizontal line halfway between the maximum and minimum y-values.

Let me verify that. If I take the maximum y-value, which is 13, and the minimum y-value, which is 2.4, then the midline should be the average of these two numbers. So, adding them together and dividing by 2. Let me calculate that.

So, 13 plus 2.4 equals... 15.4. Then divide by 2 gives 7.7. Therefore, the midline should be y = 7.7. But wait, maybe they want it expressed as a fraction instead of a decimal? Let me check the original numbers again. The minimum is 2.4, which is 12/5, and the maximum is 13, which is an integer. Adding 13 and 12/5: 13 is 65/5, so 65/5 + 12/5 = 77/5. Dividing by 2 gives 77/10, which is 7.7. So, 77/10 is the same as 7.7. 

But the problem says "exact expression," so fractions are preferred over decimals. Therefore, the midline equation is y = 77/10. However, let me make sure there isn't something else I'm missing here. Are there other factors that could affect the midline?

Wait, the x-coordinates of the points are given as -π/2 and 3π/2. For standard sine or cosine functions, the midline is determined purely by the vertical shift, which is the average of max and min. The horizontal position (the phase shift) doesn't affect the midline. So regardless of where the maxima and minima occur horizontally, the midline depends only on their vertical positions. 

Therefore, even though the x-values are different, since the y-values are 2.4 and 13, the midline is indeed the average of those. So my calculation seems correct. 

Another way to think about it: if you have a sinusoidal function in the form y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, the midline is y = D. The amplitude is |A|, and the vertical shift D is the average of the max and min. So yes, D = (max + min)/2. 

So plugging in the numbers: (13 + 2.4)/2 = 15.4 / 2 = 7.7. As a fraction, 15.4 is 154/10, which simplifies to 77/5 when divided by 2. Wait, no. Wait, 15.4 divided by 2 is 7.7, which is 77/10. Because 15.4 is 154/10, so half of that is 77/10. Yes. So 77/10 is the exact value. 

Alternatively, converting 2.4 to a fraction: 2.4 = 12/5. Then 13 is 13/1. So adding 13 and 12/5: convert 13 to fifths, which is 65/5. Then 65/5 + 12/5 = 77/5. Divide by 2: 77/5 ÷ 2 = 77/10. Yep, same result. 

So the midline equation is y = 77/10, which is 7.7. So the exact expression would be y = 77/10. Alternatively, written as y = \frac{77}{10}. 

I don't see any other elements in the problem that would influence the midline. The points given are just the max and min, so their y-values are sufficient. Therefore, the answer should be y equals 77 over 10.
