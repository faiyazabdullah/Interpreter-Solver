QUESTION:
A rectangle is inscribed between the $x$-axis and the parabola $y=36-x^2$ with one side along the $x$-axis, as shown in the figure below. Let $x$ denote the $x$-coordinate of the point highlighted in the figure. Write the area $A$ of the rectangle as a function of $x$.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the area A of a rectangle inscribed between the x-axis and the parabola y = 36 - x², with one side along the x-axis. The variable x here refers to the x-coordinate of a highlighted point in the figure. 

First, I should visualize the scenario. The parabola opens downward because the coefficient of x² is negative. The vertex of the parabola is at (0, 36). The rectangle has its base on the x-axis, so two of its vertices are on the x-axis, and the other two touch the parabola. Since it's symmetric, maybe the rectangle is centered around the y-axis? But the problem mentions a specific x-coordinate, so perhaps the rectangle isn't necessarily symmetric?

Wait, but if the rectangle is inscribed between the x-axis and the parabola, then the top corners of the rectangle lie on the parabola. Let me think about how to model this.

Let’s assume the rectangle has its base on the x-axis. Let's say the rectangle extends from (-a, 0) to (a, 0) on the x-axis, making the length of the base 2a. Then the height of the rectangle would be determined by the y-value of the parabola at x = a. Since the parabola equation is y = 36 - x², substituting x = a gives y = 36 - a². Therefore, the height of the rectangle is 36 - a². Hence, the area A would be base times height, which is 2a*(36 - a²).

But wait, the problem says "Let x denote the x-coordinate of the point highlighted in the figure." If the rectangle is symmetric, then the highlighted point could be one of the upper corners, say (a, 36 - a²). However, the problem states that x is the x-coordinate of that point, so maybe they're taking x as 'a' in my previous notation. Then the area A would be 2x*(36 - x²). Wait, but let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the rectangle isn't symmetric. Suppose the rectangle has its left side at x = p and right side at x = q, with the same y-coordinate for the top corners. Then the width of the rectangle would be q - p, and the height would be the y-value of the parabola at x = p or x = q. But since the parabola is symmetric, if the rectangle is not symmetric, the points (p, y) and (q, y) would have to satisfy y = 36 - p² and y = 36 - q². But unless p = -q, these would differ. However, if the rectangle is symmetric, then p = -q, leading to width 2p and height 36 - p². Thus, area A = 2p*(36 - p²). Here, if x is the x-coordinate of the highlighted point, which is either p or q, but assuming symmetry, maybe x is p, so replacing p with x, the area becomes 2x*(36 - x²). However, looking back at the problem statement, there's a mention of the rectangle being inscribed between the x-axis and the parabola, with one side along the x-axis. This suggests that the base is on the x-axis, and the top side touches the parabola. Therefore, the standard setup would be having two points on the parabola symmetrically placed, so that the rectangle's top side is horizontal. 

But let me check the given predicates. There's a predicate that says Equals(HeightOf(Rectangle(R)), Sub(36, Pow(x,2))). That suggests that the height of the rectangle is 36 - x². Also, LengthOf(Line(1)) equals Mul(2, x). So Line(1) is probably the base of the rectangle, whose length is 2x. Then the area of the rectangle would be LengthOf(Line(1)) multiplied by HeightOf(Rectangle(R)). Which would be 2x*(36 - x²). Therefore, the area A as a function of x is 2x*(36 - x²). 

Wait, but let me confirm. The problem says "Write the area A of the rectangle as a function of x". Given that the x here is the x-coordinate of the highlighted point, which in the standard setup would be the x-coordinate where the rectangle touches the parabola. So, for example, if the rectangle extends from (-x, 0) to (x, 0) on the x-axis, then the top corners are at (-x, y) and (x, y), where y = 36 - x². Therefore, the height of the rectangle is y = 36 - x², and the length of the base is 2x. Hence, area A = base × height = 2x*(36 - x²). 

Therefore, simplifying, A(x) = 2x(36 - x²) = 72x - 2x³. 

Looking back at the given predicates, there's also a relation that Equals(AreaOf(Rectangle(R)), Mul(LengthOf(Line(1)), HeightOf(Rectangle(R)))). And LengthOf(Line(1)) is Mul(2, x). So indeed, Area = 2x*(36 - x²). 

Thus, the answer should be A(x) = 2x(36 - x²), which expands to 72x - 2x³. 

I think that's correct. Let me make sure there's no mistake here. Another way to think: suppose the rectangle has width w and height h. Since it's sitting on the x-axis, the base is w, and the height is h. The top corners are at (a, h) and (-a, h) if symmetric. Then h = 36 - a², and the width is 2a. So area A = 2a*(36 - a²). If x is a, then A(x) = 2x*(36 - x²). Yes, that matches. So the answer is 2x(36 - x²).
