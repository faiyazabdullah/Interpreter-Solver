====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the distance between the two endpoints given here. So, the problem says we have points A and B. From the Equals predicates, point A is (-3, 4) and point B is (5, 2). The question is asking for the distance between these two points using the distance formula. Alright, I need to recall the distance formula between two points in a coordinate plane.

First, I remember that the distance formula is derived from the Pythagorean theorem. If you have two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the distance between them is the square root of [(x2 - x1) squared plus (y2 - y1) squared]. Let me write that down to make sure I have it right. So, distance d equals sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2].

So applying that here, point A has coordinates (-3, 4), so x1 is -3 and y1 is 4. Point B is (5, 2), so x2 is 5 and y2 is 2. Plugging these into the formula, the differences would be (5 - (-3)) for the x-coordinates and (2 - 4) for the y-coordinates. 

Calculating the x difference first: 5 minus (-3) is 5 + 3, which is 8. Then the y difference: 2 - 4 is -2. Now, squaring each of those differences. 8 squared is 64, and (-2) squared is 4. Adding those together gives 64 + 4 = 68. Then the distance is the square root of 68. Wait, but the problem says to round to three decimal places. Hmm, so sqrt(68) is approximately... Let me calculate that. 

I know that sqrt(64) is 8 and sqrt(81) is 9, so sqrt(68) should be somewhere around 8.246? Let me check more accurately. Let's compute sqrt(68):

Let me do a better calculation. Let's see, 8.2 squared is 67.24, because 8*8=64, 0.2^2=0.04, and cross term 2*8*0.2=3.2. Wait, no, actually, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². If I take a = 8, b = 0.2, then (8 + 0.2)^2 = 64 + 2*(8)*(0.2) + 0.04 = 64 + 3.2 + 0.04 = 67.24. That's 8.2 squared. But our target is 68, which is 68 - 67.24 = 0.76 higher. So, maybe we can approximate further. Let me try 8.24. Let's compute 8.24 squared. 

Breaking it down: 8 + 0.24. Squared, that's 8² + 2*8*0.24 + 0.24² = 64 + 3.84 + 0.0576 = 64 + 3.84 is 67.84 + 0.0576 is 67.8976. Still less than 68. The difference is 68 - 67.8976 = 0.1024. So next, let's try adding another 0.01 to 8.24, making it 8.25. 8.25 squared is (8 + 0.25)^2 = 64 + 2*8*0.25 + 0.25² = 64 + 4 + 0.0625 = 68.0625. Oh, that's over 68. So sqrt(68) is between 8.24 and 8.25. Let me find a better approximation.

Since at 8.24, the square is 67.8976, and at 8.25, it's 68.0625. The difference between 8.24 and 8.25 is 0.01 in x, leading to a difference in squares of 68.0625 - 67.8976 = 0.1649. We need to cover 0.1024 from 67.8976 to 68. So fractionally, 0.1024 / 0.1649 ≈ 0.621. Therefore, approximate sqrt(68) ≈ 8.24 + 0.621 * 0.01 ≈ 8.24 + 0.00621 ≈ 8.24621. Rounded to three decimal places, that would be 8.246. Let me verify with a calculator method. Alternatively, since 8.246^2?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me just compute sqrt(68) numerically. Since 8.246^2 = ?

Well, let's compute 8.246 * 8.246. Let's break it down:

First, multiply 8 * 8.246 = 65.968

Then 0.246 * 8.246. Wait, this might get too involved. Maybe instead, accept that sqrt(68) ≈ 8.246 and round to three decimal places. However, to ensure accuracy, maybe I should use a calculator-like approach. But since I don't have a calculator here, I'll proceed with the approximation. Alternatively, note that sqrt(68) can be simplified. Wait, 68 factors into 4*17, so sqrt(4*17) = 2*sqrt(17). So sqrt(68) is 2√17. But √17 is approximately 4.1231, so multiplying by 2 gives about 8.2462. Which matches the earlier approximation. Therefore, rounding to three decimal places, it would be 8.246. Hence, the distance is approximately 8.246 units.

Wait, but let me confirm once again. Because if I have 2 times sqrt(17), and sqrt(17) is approx 4.1231056256..., so 2*4.1231056256 is 8.2462112512... So yes, up to three decimal places, it's 8.246. So that's the answer.

Therefore, putting it all together, the distance between (-3,4) and (5,2) is sqrt(68), which is approximately 8.246 when rounded to three decimal places.
