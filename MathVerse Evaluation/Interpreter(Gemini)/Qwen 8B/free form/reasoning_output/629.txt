QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The x-axis represents Time (minutes) and the y-axis represents Water (liters). The slope is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Archimedes drained the water in his tub.
The amount of water left in the tub (in liters) as a function of time (in minutes) is graphed.
How much water was initially in the tub?

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the initial amount of water in the tub, which is represented by the y-intercept of the linear function graphed. The problem states that the line intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Also, the slope is negative since the water is draining over time.

First, I need to recall that a linear function can be written in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis, that's when time (x) is 0. In this case, the y-intercept is given as (0, 360), so b should be 360. But wait, the question asks for the initial amount of water, which would be the y-value when time is 0. That seems straightforward, but maybe there's more to it?

Wait, let me check again. The problem says the line intersects the y-axis at (0, 360). So that point is (time=0, water=360 liters). Therefore, the initial amount of water should just be 360 liters. But why is the problem giving other information like the x-intercept at (5,0)? Maybe there's a trick here? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Hold on, maybe they want me to verify this using the slope and intercept? Let's think. If the line passes through (5,0) and (0,360), then we can compute the slope. The slope formula is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Taking the two points (0, 360) and (5, 0), the slope m would be (0 - 360)/(5 - 0) = -360/5 = -72. So the equation of the line is y = -72x + 360. 

But the initial amount of water is when x=0, which is indeed 360 liters. So regardless of the slope, the y-intercept gives the initial value. However, the problem mentions that the slope is less than 0, which aligns with the negative slope here. So maybe the answer is simply 360 liters?

Wait, but the problem says "Archimedes drained the water in his tub," implying that the water is decreasing over time, which matches the negative slope. The x-intercept at (5,0) means that after 5 minutes, the tub is empty. So the initial amount is 360 liters. 

But let me make sure there isn't any hidden detail. The problem uses the term "linear function" and the axes represent time and water. The key here is that the y-intercept corresponds to the initial amount because at time t=0, the water level is highest. Therefore, the answer should be 360 liters. 

Alternatively, could there be a misunderstanding in the coordinate system? For example, sometimes graphs have different scales, but the problem explicitly states that the x-axis is time (minutes) and y-axis is water (liters). The points given are (5,0) and (0,360), so plugging into the equation confirms the y-intercept is 360. 

Therefore, the initial amount of water is 360 liters. The other information about the slope and the x-intercept is just additional context to confirm the line's behavior, but the answer directly comes from the y-intercept. So I think that's it.

FINAL RESPONSE:

Final Answer: $360$ liters

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Predicate Analysis**:  
   - The line intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and y-axis at (0,360).  
   - The x-axis represents time (minutes), and the y-axis represents water (liters).  
   - The slope is negative, indicating water decreases over time.  

2. **Constraint Synthesis**:  
   - The y-intercept of the line occurs at $x = 0$, corresponding to time $t = 0$.  
   - At $t = 0$, the water volume is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept, which is **360 liters**.  

3. **Solution Strategy**:  
   - Use the linear function $y = mx + b$, where $b$ is the y-intercept.  
   - The y-intercept directly gives the initial water volume when $x = 0$.  

4. **Mathematical Derivation**:  
   - Given points (0, 360) and (5, 0):  
     $$
     \text{slope } m = \frac{0 - 360}{5 - 0} = -72
     $$  
     Equation: $y = -72x + 360$.  
   - Initial water volume ($x = 0$): $y = 360$.  

5. **Verification**:  
   - The y-intercept (0, 360) confirms the initial volume before drainage began.  

Final Answer: $360$ liters
