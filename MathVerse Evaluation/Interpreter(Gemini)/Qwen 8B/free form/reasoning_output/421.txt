MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the remaining area after subtracting two rectangles' areas. Let me start by understanding the given predicates.

First, there are two rectangles mentioned: Rectangle(1) and Rectangle(2). Each has an associated AreaOf function. The first rectangle's area is given as 6096, and the second one is 6000. Then there's a Sub(AreaOf(1), AreaOf(2)) which I think means subtracting the area of the second rectangle from the first. The question asks, "How much area is remaining?" given that the total area is 6096.

Wait, hold on. The total area is stated as 6096. But if we have two rectangles, maybe the total area refers to the sum of both? Or perhaps it's referring to something else. Let me parse the problem again carefully.

The problem says: "The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?" Given that the predicates mention AreaOf(1) equals 6096 and AreaOf(2) equals 6000, and then Sub(AreaOf(1), AreaOf(2)). 

Hmm, so maybe the "total area" here refers to the area of the first rectangle, which is 6096. Then the question is asking how much area remains after subtracting the area of the second rectangle. That would make sense. Because if you have a total area (the first rectangle) and you remove another area (the second rectangle), the remaining area would be the difference between them.

So, the problem is essentially asking for AreaOf(1) minus AreaOf(2). Since AreaOf(1) is 6096 and AreaOf(2) is 6000, subtracting them gives 6096 - 6000 = 96. Therefore, the remaining area should be 96.

But wait, let me check if there's more to it. Are there any other factors or geometric considerations? The problem mentions using the given predicates, which include the subtraction of the areas. The Sub predicate probably indicates that we need to compute the difference between the two areas. Since the total area is given as 6096 (which matches AreaOf(1)), subtracting AreaOf(2) would give the remaining part. 

I don't see any other geometric elements hereâ€”no overlapping areas, no additional constraints. It seems straightforward. So the calculation is simply 6096 minus 6000, resulting in 96. 

Therefore, the remaining area is 96. The answer should be presented in a box as per the instructions.
