QUESTION:
Two similar cylinders have volumes of 5760\mathrm{cm}^3 and 90\mathrm{cm}^3.


Find the fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have two similar cylinders with volumes 5760 cm³ and 90 cm³. We need to find the ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the smaller one. Hmm, wait, but they already gave the volumes? Let me check again.

Wait, the question says "Find the fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder." But the given volumes are 5760 and 90. So maybe I just need to take those numbers and form the ratio?

But hold on, the problem mentions that the cylinders are similar. Similarity in geometry usually relates to scaling factors. For similar figures, the ratio of their volumes is the cube of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. But here, since they already gave the volumes, maybe the ratio is simply 5760 divided by 90? But let me make sure there isn't more to it.

Let me recall: if two solids are similar, the ratio of their volumes is the cube of the scale factor. However, in this case, the problem states that the volumes are 5760 and 90. So regardless of the scale factor, the ratio would be 5760:90. Simplifying that fraction... Let me compute that.

First, divide numerator and denominator by 90. Wait, 5760 ÷ 90. Let me calculate that. 90 times 64 is 5760 because 90*60=5400, 90*4=360, so 5400+360=5760. So 5760 divided by 90 is 64. Therefore, the ratio is 64:1. 

But wait, does similarity affect this? Because if they were not similar, the ratio could vary. But since they are similar, the ratio of volumes should indeed be the cube of the scale factor. However, since we are directly given the volumes, the ratio is straightforward. Let me confirm with another approach.

Alternatively, suppose the scale factor between the cylinders is k. Then, since they're similar, the ratio of their volumes is k³. So Volume1 / Volume2 = k³. Here, Volume1 is 5760, Volume2 is 90. So 5760 / 90 = k³. Which gives k³ = 64, hence k = 4. But the question asks for the ratio of the larger to the smaller volume, which is exactly 5760 / 90 = 64. So yes, the ratio is 64:1.

Therefore, the answer is 64. But let me check if there's any chance I misread the problem. The problem says "the ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder". Since 5760 is larger than 90, the ratio is 5760/90, which simplifies to 64. So yeah, that seems correct.

I think that's it. The key was recognizing that even though similarity implies a relationship between linear dimensions and volume, since the volumes are given, the ratio is simply the quotient of the two volumes. Also, simplifying 5760/90 gives 64. So the final answer is 64.
