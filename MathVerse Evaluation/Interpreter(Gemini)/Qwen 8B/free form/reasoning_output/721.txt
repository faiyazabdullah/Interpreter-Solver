QUESTION:
Consider the rectangular prism shown with its height is 12m and the length of its base is $(x+4)m$ and $(x+8)m$ respectively.

Write a fully expanded and simplified expression for the volume of the prism.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the volume of a rectangular prism where the base has sides of lengths (x + 4) meters and (x + 8) meters, and the height is 12 meters. 

First, I remember that the volume of a prism is calculated by multiplying the area of the base by the height. Since it's a rectangular prism, the base is a rectangle. The formula should be Volume = Base Area × Height. 

The problem gives us the expressions for the lengths of the base. Let me note that down. The base is a rectangle with length (x + 4) and width (x + 8). Therefore, the area of the base would be the product of these two lengths. So, Base Area = (x + 4)(x + 8). 

Wait, the problem also mentions some predicates like Mul(x+4,x+8,BaseArea). That seems to confirm that BaseArea is indeed the product of those two terms. Then, the height of the prism is given as 12 meters. So, the volume would be BaseArea multiplied by 12. 

So putting it all together, Volume = (x + 4)(x + 8) * 12. But maybe they want it fully expanded? Let me check the question again. It says "fully expanded and simplified expression". So I need to multiply out the terms first. 

Let me expand (x + 4)(x + 8). Using the distributive property (FOIL method), that would be x*x + x*8 + 4*x + 4*8. Which simplifies to x² + 8x + 4x + 32. Combining like terms, that becomes x² + 12x + 32. Then multiply by 12. 

So Volume = 12*(x² + 12x + 32). Now distribute the 12 across each term inside the parentheses. That would be 12x² + 144x + 384. So the expanded form is 12x² + 144x + 384. 

But wait, let me verify if there are any other steps or if I missed something. The problem didn't mention anything about solving for x, just expressing the volume in terms of x. So expanding the polynomial is correct here. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach it? Let me think. If there were more constraints, but no, the problem doesn't give any equations involving x. So the volume is expressed purely in terms of x, so expanding is necessary. 

Therefore, the final expression after expansion is 12x² + 144x + 384. Let me check my multiplication again. 

Original base area: (x + 4)(x + 8). Multiply them:

First, x times x is x². Then x times 8 is 8x. Then 4 times x is 4x. Then 4 times 8 is 32. Adding up the middle terms: 8x + 4x = 12x. So yes, x² + 12x + 32. Multiply by 12: 

12 * x² = 12x², 12 * 12x = 144x, 12 * 32 = 384. Correct. 

So the expanded and simplified expression is 12x² + 144x + 384. 

I think that's all. There's no further simplification unless factoring back, but the question asks for expanded form. So this should be the answer.
