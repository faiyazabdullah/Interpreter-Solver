QUESTION:
There is a hyperbola in blue with double arrows intersects with y-axis at -4 and 4. Its asymptote in dashed orange is $y=(4/5)x$ and $y=-(4/5)x$. There is also a green rectangular tangent to the hyperbola. Find the equation of the hyperbola.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this hyperbola problem. Hmm, the question says there's a hyperbola intersecting the y-axis at -4 and 4, so those points are probably A and B? Also, the asymptotes are given as y = (4/5)x and y = -(4/5)x. And there's a rectangle tangent to the hyperbola. Need to find the equation of the hyperbola.

First, I remember that the standard form of a hyperbola centered at the origin with horizontal transverse axis is x²/a² - y²/b² = 1. But wait, since the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x. Here, the slopes are 4/5, so b/a = 4/5. So maybe b = 4k and a = 5k for some k?

But the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at (0,4) and (0,-4). Wait, but for a standard hyperbola, the y-intercepts would occur where x=0. Let me plug x=0 into the hyperbola equation: x²/a² - y²/b² = 1 becomes -y²/b² = 1 → y² = -b². That can't be real. Oh, so that suggests that the hyperbola isn't oriented horizontally. Maybe it's vertical? Then the standard form would be y²/a² - x²/b² = 1, with asymptotes y = ±(a/b)x. Wait, but here the asymptotes have slope 4/5, so if it's a vertical hyperbola, then a/b = 4/5. But then the y-intercepts would be found by setting x=0: y²/a² = 1 ⇒ y = ±a. But according to the problem, the y-intercepts are at ±4. Therefore, a = 4. Then, since a/b = 4/5, we have 4/b = 4/5 ⇒ b = 5. 

Wait, but then the standard form would be y²/16 - x²/25 = 1. Let me check if that fits. The asymptotes would be y = ±(a/b)x = ±(4/5)x, which matches the given asymptotes. Also, the y-intercepts are at (0, ±4), which matches the problem statement. But wait, the problem mentions that the hyperbola has double arrows intersecting the y-axis at -4 and 4. So that seems correct. However, I need to make sure about the orientation. If the hyperbola is vertical, its transverse axis is along the y-axis, so yes, intercepts on y-axis. 

But another thought: sometimes hyperbolas can be written in other forms if they're not centered at the origin. But the problem mentions that the asymptotes pass through the origin because the asymptotes are y = (4/5)x and y = -(4/5)x, which both go through (0,0). Also, the hyperbola intersects the y-axis at (0,4) and (0,-4), so the center should be at the midpoint between these two points. Wait, the midpoint of (0,4) and (0,-4) is (0,0). So the center is at the origin. Thus, the standard form is either x²/a² - y²/b² = 1 or y²/a² - x²/b² = 1. Since the asymptotes are y = ±(b/a)x or y = ±(a/b)x depending on orientation. 

Earlier conclusion was that since the hyperbola crosses the y-axis, which would require the vertical transverse axis. Because if it were horizontal, plugging x=0 wouldn't give real solutions. Therefore, the hyperbola is vertical, so equation is y²/a² - x²/b² = 1. Asymptotes are y = ±(a/b)x. Given that the asymptotes are y = ±(4/5)x, so a/b = 4/5. Also, the y-intercepts are at (0, ±a), so a = 4. Hence, b = (5/4)a = 5. Therefore, the equation is y²/16 - x²/25 = 1. 

But let me check again. Suppose the hyperbola is horizontal, then it would cross the x-axis, not the y-axis. But the problem states that it intersects the y-axis at -4 and 4, so that would mean it's crossing the y-axis, implying that it's a vertical hyperbola. Therefore, my previous conclusion holds. 

Another thing: the problem mentions a rectangle tangent to the hyperbola. Not sure how that affects things, but perhaps it's just extra info. The main constraints are the asymptotes and the y-intercepts. 

So putting it all together, the equation should be y²/16 - x²/25 = 1. Let me confirm once more. The asymptotes are y = ±(a/b)x. With a=4 and b=5, that gives 4/5, which matches. The y-intercepts are at y=±a=±4, which matches the given points. So yes, that should be the equation.
