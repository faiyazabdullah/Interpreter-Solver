QUESTION:
There is a quadratic function going through (-2,1), (-1,2), (0,1). Write an equation for the graphed function f.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the quadratic function that passes through the points (-2,1), (-1,2), and (0,1). Hmm, quadratic functions are parabolas, right? Their general form is f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Since we have three points, maybe I can plug them into this equation and solve for a, b, and c?

Let me start by writing down the equations. 

First, for the point (-2,1): plugging x = -2, y = 1 into the quadratic equation gives 1 = a(-2)² + b(-2) + c. That simplifies to 1 = 4a - 2b + c.

Next, the point (-1,2): substituting x = -1, y = 2 gives 2 = a(-1)² + b(-1) + c. Which becomes 2 = a - b + c.

Then, the third point (0,1): here, x=0, so plugging in gives 1 = a(0)² + b(0) + c → 1 = c. Oh, that's straightforward! So c is 1. Great, that's one variable found.

Now, substitute c = 1 into the other two equations. Let's do that.

First equation: 1 = 4a - 2b + 1. Subtract 1 from both sides: 0 = 4a - 2b → 4a = 2b → Simplify, divide both sides by 2: 2a = b. So b is twice a.

Second equation: 2 = a - b + 1. Subtract 1: 1 = a - b. But since b = 2a, replace b with 2a: 1 = a - 2a → 1 = -a → Therefore, a = -1.

Then, since b = 2a, substituting a = -1 gives b = -2.

So putting it all together, the quadratic function is f(x) = -x² - 2x + 1. Wait, let me check if these points satisfy this equation.

Check for x=-2: f(-2) = -(-2)^2 -2*(-2) +1 = -4 +4 +1 = 1. Correct.

For x=-1: f(-1) = -(-1)^2 -2*(-1) +1 = -1 +2 +1 = 2. Correct.

For x=0: f(0) = -0 -0 +1 = 1. Correct. Seems good.

But wait, could there be another way to approach this? Maybe using vertex form? Let me see. Since the points include (0,1), which is the y-intercept. In standard form, c is the y-intercept, so that matches. Alternatively, maybe symmetry?

Alternatively, since it's a quadratic, maybe we can think about the axis of symmetry. The axis of symmetry is at x = -b/(2a). The points (-2,1) and (0,1) have the same y-value. That suggests that the parabola is symmetric around the midpoint between x=-2 and x=0. The midpoint is at (-1, 1). Wait, but the axis of symmetry would be x = -1. Let me confirm.

If the axis of symmetry is x = h, then the vertex is at (h, k). The midpoint between -2 and 0 is indeed x = (-2 + 0)/2 = -1. So the axis of symmetry is x = -1. Therefore, the vertex is at x = -1. Let's check the point (-1,2). Wait, that's the second point. So the vertex is at (-1, 2)? Because the axis of symmetry is x=-1, and the vertex lies on that line. So substituting x=-1 into the equation gives y=2, which matches the point (-1,2). Therefore, the vertex form is f(x) = a(x + 1)^2 + 2.

Expanding this: a(x² + 2x + 1) + 2 = ax² + 2ax + a + 2. Comparing to standard form, which is ax² + bx + c. Here, b = 2a and c = a + 2. Now, using the point (0,1): when x=0, f(0)=a*0 + 0 + a + 2 = a + 2 = 1. Therefore, a = 1 - 2 = -1. Then, the equation becomes f(x) = -1(x +1)^2 + 2. Expanding that gives -x² -2x -1 + 2 = -x² -2x +1, which matches our earlier result. So that checks out. 

Therefore, the quadratic function is f(x) = -x² -2x +1. 

I think that's solid. Both methods lead to the same answer, and verifying each point confirms correctness. No mistakes detected here.
