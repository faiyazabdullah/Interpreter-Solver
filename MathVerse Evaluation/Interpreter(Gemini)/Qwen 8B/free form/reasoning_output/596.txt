QUESTION:
The line passes (-2,-6) and (2,-3). Write an equation that represents the line.
Use exact numbers.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the equation of the line that passes through the points A(-2, -6) and B(2, -3). Let me start by recalling how to find the equation of a line given two points. 

First, I remember that the general form of a line's equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. To find m, I can use the formula for slope between two points: m = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Let me calculate that. 

Given points A(-2, -6) and B(2, -3), let me assign them as (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). So substituting the values into the slope formula: m = (-3 - (-6)) / (2 - (-2)). Simplifying the numerator: -3 + 6 = 3. Denominator: 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, the slope m is 3/4. Wait, that seems straightforward. 

Now that I have the slope, I need to find the y-intercept b. Using the point-slope form might be easier here. Alternatively, plug one of the points into y = mx + b. Let me pick point A(-2, -6). Substituting x = -2 and y = -6 into the equation: -6 = (3/4)(-2) + b. Calculating (3/4)*(-2): that's -6/4, which simplifies to -3/2. So the equation becomes -6 = -3/2 + b. Solving for b, add 3/2 to both sides: b = -6 + 3/2. Converting -6 to halves: that's -12/2, so -12/2 + 3/2 = -9/2. Therefore, b is -9/2. 

So putting it all together, the equation of the line should be y = (3/4)x - 9/2. But maybe I should check if this works with the other point, B(2, -3). Let me substitute x=2 into the equation: y = (3/4)(2) - 9/2 = 3/2 - 9/2 = -6/2 = -3. That matches the y-coordinate of point B, so it checks out. 

Alternatively, another way to write the equation could be in standard form Ax + By + C = 0. Let me convert my current equation to that form. Starting with y = (3/4)x - 9/2, multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate fractions: 4y = 3x - 18. Rearranging terms: -3x + 4y + 18 = 0, or equivalently 3x - 4y - 18 = 0. However, the question says "Write an equation that represents the line" without specifying the form, so either slope-intercept or standard form is acceptable. Since they mentioned "exact numbers," perhaps slope-intercept is better because it directly shows the slope and intercept. 

Wait, but sometimes equations are preferred in integer coefficients. Let me see if there's another way. Another method to find the equation is using the two-point form. The formula is (y - y1) = m(x - x1). We already found m=3/4, so using point A(-2, -6): y - (-6) = (3/4)(x - (-2)), which simplifies to y + 6 = (3/4)(x + 2). Expanding that gives y = (3/4)x + (3/4)*2 - 6. Which is y = (3/4)x + 3/2 - 6. Converting 6 to halves: 6 is 12/2, so 3/2 - 12/2 = -9/2. Same result as before. 

Therefore, the equation is confirmed. Alternatively, if I wanted to present it in standard form with integers, multiplying by 4 gives 4y = 3x - 18, rearranged as 3x - 4y = 18. Both forms are correct, but since the problem didn't specify a particular form, I think slope-intercept is more direct here. 

Let me just verify once again. Suppose I take point B(2, -3): plugging into 3x -4y = 18: 3*2 -4*(-3)=6 +12=18, which equals the right-hand side. Correct. And for point A: 3*(-2) -4*(-6)=-6 +24=18. Also correct. So standard form is also valid. 

But the question says "Write an equation that represents the line." Either form is acceptable. However, in many cases, especially when exact numbers are required, slope-intercept form is preferable because it explicitly shows the slope and intercept. But perhaps the problem expects one specific form. Given that the original points have integer coordinates, maybe standard form with integer coefficients is better. Let me check if there's a conventional preference. 

In academic settings, unless specified, both are acceptable. Since the user mentioned "exact numbers," and both forms have exact numbers, but perhaps the slope-intercept form is more intuitive. However, to avoid fractions, standard form might be better. Let me consider both possibilities. 

Alternatively, the problem might accept any correct linear equation. Let me check if there's another way. For example, parametric equations? Probably not necessary here. The simplest is slope-intercept. 

Another thought: Maybe the problem wants the equation in a specific format like Ax + By = C, but since they said "equation that represents the line", any correct equation is okay. 

Since the problem includes the Equals predicates for points A and B, which are given as (-2,-6) and (2,-3), respectively, the answer should be based on those coordinates. So regardless of the form, as long as it's accurate. 

Thus, the final answer can be written as y = (3/4)x - 9/2 or 3x - 4y = 18. Both are correct. However, considering that the question might expect the most simplified version without fractions, maybe the standard form is better. Let me check the calculation again. 

Original slope was 3/4, so slope-intercept is y = (3/4)x - 9/2. If we want to avoid fractions, multiply both sides by 4: 4y = 3x - 18 → 3x - 4y = 18. This is also a valid equation. 

Either way, both are correct. The problem statement doesn't specify the form, so I can choose either. However, in some contexts, the standard form is considered more formal. But since the user hasn't specified, I'll go with slope-intercept as it directly uses the computed slope and intercept. 

Wait, but let me check if there's a possibility of error in calculation. Let me recalculate the slope. Points A(-2, -6) and B(2, -3). The difference in y-coordinates is (-3) - (-6) = 3. Difference in x-coordinates is 2 - (-2) = 4. Slope is 3/4. Correct. Then using point A to find b: y = mx + b → -6 = (3/4)(-2) + b → -6 = -3/2 + b → b = -6 + 3/2 = -9/2. Yes, correct. 

Alternatively, using point B: y = (3/4)x + b. Plug in (2, -3): -3 = (3/4)(2) + b → -3 = 3/2 + b → b = -3 - 3/2 = -9/2. Same result. 

Thus, the equation is correct. So the answer is y = (3/4)x - 9/2. Or converting to standard form, 3x - 4y = 18. Either is acceptable. 

But since the problem mentions "exact numbers," fractions are exact, so both forms are fine. However, if the problem expects a certain form, but since it's unspecified, I'll present both options. But the user might prefer one. In many textbooks, the slope-intercept form is commonly used. Therefore, I'll present that as the final answer.
