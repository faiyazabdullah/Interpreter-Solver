The composite solid consists of two hemispheres stuck together. The diameter of large hemisphere is 12 centimeters and small hemisphere is 6 centimeters. Find the volume of the solid.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's see. I need to find the volume of a composite solid made up of two hemispheres. The problem gives me the diameters of both hemispheres: the large one has a diameter of 12 cm, and the small one is 6 cm. Wait, but they also mention radii? Let me check the given predicates again.

Oh right, DiameterOf(LargeHemisphere,12) and RadiusOf(LargeHemisphere,6). So since diameter is twice the radius, that checks out. Similarly for the SmallHemisphere, diameter 6 cm means radius 3 cm. Got it.

Now, the composite solid is formed by sticking these two hemispheres together. Hmm, how are they connected? Typically, when you combine two hemispheres, you might attach them at their flat faces. Like, if you take a large hemisphere and a small hemisphere, maybe you glue them together so that their circular bases are joined. But wait, hemispheres have a curved surface and a flat circular base. If they're stuck together, perhaps the smaller hemisphere is attached to the larger one such that their flat surfaces are merged? Or maybe one is attached to the top of the other?

Wait, but the way the problem is phrased, "two hemispheres stuck together"—probably forming a shape like a sphere but with different sizes. Wait, no. If you stick two hemispheres together along their flat faces, you'd get a full sphere if they were the same size. But here, they are different sizes. So maybe one hemisphere is attached to the other in such a way that their curved surfaces form a sort of irregular shape. But I need to think about how to calculate the total volume.

But regardless of how they are stuck together, the volume should just be the sum of the volumes of each individual hemisphere. Because when you combine solids, their volumes add up, assuming there's no overlapping. Since they are stuck together, I assume they are combined without overlapping. So Volume_total = Volume_large_hemisphere + Volume_small_hemisphere.

So my job is to compute each hemisphere's volume and add them.

First, recall the formula for the volume of a hemisphere. A hemisphere is half of a sphere. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, so half of that would be (2/3)πr³.

Let me confirm that. Yes, because if you take a sphere's volume and divide by 2, you get the volume of a hemisphere. So for each hemisphere, the volume is (2/3)πr³.

So first, calculate the volume of the large hemisphere. Its radius is given as 6 cm. Plugging into the formula:

V_large = (2/3)π*(6)^3.

Similarly, the small hemisphere has radius 3 cm:

V_small = (2/3)π*(3)^3.

Then add them together.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor out common terms. Let me compute each part step by step.

Calculating V_large:

(2/3) * π * 6³. Let's compute 6³ first. 6*6=36, 36*6=216. So 216.

Then multiply by 2/3: (2/3)*216 = 144. So V_large = 144π cm³.

For the small hemisphere:

3³ is 27. Then (2/3)*27 = 18. So V_small = 18π cm³.

Total volume is 144π + 18π = 162π cm³.

Now, the question says to round to two decimal places. So I need to calculate 162π numerically. Let's compute that.

π is approximately 3.1415926535...

So 162 * π ≈ 162 * 3.1415926535 ≈ ?

Let me do the multiplication step by step. First, 160 * π ≈ 502.65482457... Then 2 * π ≈ 6.283185307. Adding those gives 502.65482457 + 6.283185307 ≈ 508.93800988 cm³.

Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 508.94 cm³.

Wait, but let me verify the calculation more accurately. Maybe using calculator-like steps.

Alternatively, 162 × π:

Well, π ≈ 3.1416

So 162 × 3.1416:

Breakdown:

First compute 160 × 3.1416 = ?

Well, 100 × 3.1416 = 314.16

So 160 × 3.1416 = 16 × 314.16? Wait no, better to do:

Wait 160 × 3.1416 = (100 + 60) × 3.1416 = 100×3.1416 + 60×3.1416

Which is 314.16 + 188.496 = 314.16 + 188.496 = 502.656

Then add 2 × 3.1416 = 6.2832

Total is 502.656 + 6.2832 = 508.9392 cm³

So rounding to two decimal places: 508.94 cm³.

Therefore, the final answer is 508.94 cubic centimeters.

But let me double-check if I did the initial volume calculations correctly. Let me recompute the volumes.

Large hemisphere radius is 6 cm. Volume is (2/3)πr³ = (2/3)π*(6)^3. 6 cubed is 216. Multiply by 2/3: 216*(2)/3 = 144. Correct. So 144π.

Small hemisphere radius 3 cm. Volume is (2/3)π*(3)^3 = (2/3)*27π = 18π. Correct. Total is 144π + 18π = 162π. Correct.

Yes, so 162π ≈ 508.938..., rounds to 508.94. That seems correct.

Another way to check: Maybe compute 162 × π directly with more precise decimals.

Using π ≈ 3.141592653589793

Compute 162 × π:

Multiply 162 × 3.141592653589793.

Let me compute 162 × 3 = 486.

Then 162 × 0.141592653589793.

First, compute 162 × 0.1 = 16.2

162 × 0.04 = 6.48

162 × 0.001592653589793 ≈ ?

Wait, maybe breaking down π as 3 + 0.1415926535...

So total is 162 × 3 + 162 × 0.1415926535...

Which is 486 + (approximate value).

Calculate 162 × 0.1415926535:

Let me compute 162 × 0.1415926535.

First, note that 0.1415926535 is approximately π - 3 ≈ 0.1415926535.

So 162 × (π - 3) ≈ ?

But maybe not helpful. Alternatively, compute 0.1 × 162 = 16.2

0.04 × 162 = 6.48

0.0015926535 × 162 ≈ ?

Well, 0.001 × 162 = 0.162

0.0005926535 × 162 ≈ approx 0.096 (since 0.0005 × 162 = 0.081, and 0.00009265 × 162 ≈ ~0.015). So total approx 0.081 + 0.015 = 0.096.

Thus adding up:

16.2 (from 0.1) + 6.48 (from 0.04) + 0.162 (from 0.001) + 0.096 (from rest) ≈ 16.2 + 6.48 = 22.68 + 0.162 = 22.842 + 0.096 ≈ 22.938.

So total volume ≈ 486 + 22.938 ≈ 508.938 cm³. Which matches our prior result. Therefore, 508.94 cm³ after rounding.

Therefore, the answer is 508.94 cm³.
