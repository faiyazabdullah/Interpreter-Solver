QUESTION:
Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is greater than 0. It intersects the x-axis and the y-axis at (0,-4). Consider the graph of $y=x-4$.

State the coordinates of the $x$-intercept in the form $(a, b)$.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the x-intercept of the line described by the equation y = x - 4. They also mention that there are two linear functions graphed, one of which has a positive slope and intersects the x-axis and y-axis at (0, -4). Wait, but the equation given is y = x - 4. Let me make sure I understand the setup correctly.

First, let's recall that the x-intercept of a line is the point where the line crosses the x-axis. At that point, the y-coordinate is zero. So, to find the x-intercept, we can set y to 0 and solve for x. That seems straightforward. But maybe there's more to it here because of the given predicates?

Looking back at the predicates provided: There's a PointLiesOnLine for the points (0, -4) and (4, 0) lying on line l. Also, Line(l) and Equals(y, x - 4). Hmm, so line l is defined by the equation y = x - 4. Therefore, the line l passes through these two points: (0, -4) and (4, 0). Wait, if we plug x=0 into y = x - 4, we get y = -4, so the y-intercept is indeed (0, -4). Then, plugging x=4 gives y=0, so the x-intercept is (4, 0). 

But the question specifically asks for the x-intercept of the graph of y = x - 4. So according to this, the x-intercept should be (4, 0). However, let me verify again. 

The general method to find the x-intercept is setting y=0 and solving for x. So starting with y = x - 4, set y=0:

0 = x - 4  
Adding 4 to both sides:  
x = 4  

Therefore, the x-intercept is at (4, 0). 

Wait, but the problem mentions "two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is greater than 0. It intersects the x-axis and the y-axis at (0,-4)." Wait, does that mean that the line in question is the same as y = x - 4? Because the line y = x - 4 has a slope of 1, which is greater than 0, and it intercepts the y-axis at (0, -4) and the x-axis at (4, 0). So yes, that matches. Therefore, the x-intercept is (4, 0).

Let me check if there's anything else I need to consider. The problem states that there are two linear functions graphed, but the question focuses on the graph of y = x - 4. Since the other function isn't specified beyond having a positive slope, but since the question is about y = x - 4, perhaps that's the main focus. 

So, putting it all together, the x-intercept is found by setting y=0, leading to x=4, hence the coordinates are (4, 0). The given predicates confirm that (4, 0) lies on line l, which is the line y = x - 4. Therefore, the answer should be (4, 0).
