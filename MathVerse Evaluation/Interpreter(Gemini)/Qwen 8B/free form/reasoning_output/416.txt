QUESTION:
In the diagram, $O$ is the center of a circle with radius 6 cm. Arc $JK$ has a length measuring 2\pi  cm. Determine the exact area of sector $OJK$.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the exact area of sector OJK given that O is the center of a circle with radius 6 cm, and the arc JK measures 2π cm. Let me start by recalling some concepts about circles and sectors.

First, the formula for the area of a sector of a circle is (θ/2) * r², where θ is the central angle in radians and r is the radius. Alternatively, since the circumference of a full circle is 2πr, the length of an arc corresponding to a central angle θ is rθ. So maybe I can find θ first using the arc length formula?

Given that the arc length JK is 2π cm, and the radius r is 6 cm. Using the arc length formula: arc length = rθ. Plugging in the numbers: 2π = 6θ. Solving for θ gives θ = 2π / 6 = π/3 radians. 

So the central angle θ is π/3 radians. Now plugging this back into the area formula for the sector: Area = (1/2) * r² * θ. Substituting r = 6 and θ = π/3:

Area = (1/2) * (6)² * (π/3). Calculating that: 6 squared is 36, half of 36 is 18, multiplied by π/3 gives 18*(π/3) = 6π. Wait, let me check again. Wait, 18 divided by 3 is 6? No, wait: 18*(π/3) is indeed 6π. But let me confirm if my initial calculation was correct.

Wait, another way: (1/2)*r²*θ = 0.5 * 36 * (π/3) = 18 * (π/3) = 6π. Yes, that's correct. So the area should be 6π cm². 

But let me make sure there are no mistakes here. Let me cross-validate. The entire circumference is 2πr = 12π cm. The arc length given is 2π cm, which is 1/6th of the total circumference. Therefore, the sector should be 1/6th of the area of the whole circle. The area of the whole circle is πr² = π*36 = 36π. Then 1/6th of that is 6π. Yep, same answer. That confirms it. So the area is 6π square centimeters. 

Therefore, the exact area of sector OJK is 6π cm².
