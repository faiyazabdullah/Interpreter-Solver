Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the slope of a line given its x-intercept and y-intercept. The x-intercept is 0.5 and the y-intercept is 2. Hmm, I need to recall how intercepts relate to the slope of a line.

First, I remember that the general equation of a line in intercept form is x/a + y/b = 1, where 'a' is the x-intercept and 'b' is the y-intercept. Wait, but maybe it's easier to convert that into the slope-intercept form, which is y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept. 

Given that the y-intercept is 2, so c = 2. The x-intercept is the point where y=0, so plugging that into the equation: 0 = m*(a) + c. Here, a is the x-intercept value, which is 0.5. So substituting, we get 0 = m*(0.5) + 2. Solving for m would give us the slope. Let me check that again.

Alternatively, another way to find the slope is using two points on the line. The x-intercept is (0.5, 0) and the y-intercept is (0, 2). So if I have these two points, I can calculate the slope using the formula (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Let me try that. 

So taking the two points: (0.5, 0) and (0, 2). Let's assign them as (x1, y1) = (0.5, 0) and (x2, y2) = (0, 2). Then the slope m = (2 - 0)/(0 - 0.5) = 2 / (-0.5) = -4. That seems straightforward. 

Wait, but let me verify using the intercept form. The intercept form is x/(0.5) + y/2 = 1. If I rearrange this to slope-intercept form, multiply both sides by 1 to get rid of denominators? Or maybe solve for y. Let's do that. Starting with x/(0.5) + y/2 = 1. Multiplying both sides by 0.5*2 to eliminate denominators? Wait, perhaps better to isolate y. 

Starting with x/(0.5) + y/2 = 1. Simplify x/(0.5) is the same as 2x. So the equation becomes 2x + (y)/2 = 1. Then subtract 2x from both sides: y/2 = -2x + 1. Multiply both sides by 2: y = -4x + 2. So the slope here is -4. Yep, that matches the previous calculation. 

Therefore, regardless of the method used, the slope comes out to be -4. Let me just make sure there are no mistakes here. The x-intercept is indeed where y=0, so plugging into the equation gives x=0.5. The y-intercept is when x=0, which gives y=2. Using those two points, the change in y is 2 - 0 = 2, and the change in x is 0 - 0.5 = -0.5. Dividing 2 by -0.5 gives -4. Correct. 

Another way to think about it: the slope is rise over run. From the y-intercept (0,2) to the x-intercept (0.5, 0), you go down 2 units (rise) and right 0.5 units (run). So slope is -2 / 0.5 = -4. All methods lead to the same answer. Therefore, the slope must be -4.
