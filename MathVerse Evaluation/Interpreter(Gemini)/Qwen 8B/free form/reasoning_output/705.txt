MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this trapezoidal prism surface area problem. First, I need to understand the given information and figure out how to compute the surface area. 

So, the problem mentions a trapezoidal prism. A trapezoidal prism has two congruent trapezoidal bases connected by rectangular faces. The surface area would then be the sum of the areas of all these faces.

The given predicates include some points and lines with specific lengths and perpendicularity. Let me parse them step by step.

First, there's a Trapezoid(A,B,C,D). So ABCD is a trapezoid. Then there are three Rectangle(1), Rectangle(2), Rectangle(3). Wait, maybe those refer to different faces? Or perhaps they're just labels? Maybe not. Let me check the other predicates.

LengthOf(Line(A,B),13): So AB is 13 cm. LengthOf(Line(B,C),10): BC is 10 cm. LengthOf(Line(C,D),3): CD is 3 cm. LengthOf(Line(A,D),10): AD is 10 cm. Also, Perpendicular(Line(B,C),Line(A,B)) and Perpendicular(Line(B,C),Line(C,D)). So BC is perpendicular to both AB and CD. That means AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, so AB and CD are parallel. Hence, ABCD is a trapezoid with bases AB and CD, since they are parallel. But wait, AB is length 13, CD is 3. And BC is 10, which connects B to C, and AD is 10 cm. Hmm.

Wait, but if AB is perpendicular to BC, then AB is vertical if BC is horizontal. Similarly, CD is also perpendicular to BC, so CD is vertical too. Wait, but then AB and CD are both vertical, making the trapezoid have two vertical sides. But then AD connects A to D, which would be the top base. Wait, but in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. Here, AB and CD are the legs? No, because if AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, then they are the legs, and the bases are BC and AD? Wait, no. Wait, in a trapezoid, the bases are the two parallel sides. Since AB is perpendicular to BC, and CD is also perpendicular to BC, then AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, hence AB || CD. Therefore, AB and CD are the two bases of the trapezoid. Wait, but AB is length 13, CD is length 3. Then BC and AD are the legs? But BC is length 10, and AD is length 10. Wait, but in a trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. If AB and CD are the bases (parallel), then BC and AD are the legs. However, here BC is perpendicular to AB and CD, so it's a right trapezoid. Because at least two right angles. So yes, this is a right trapezoid with bases AB=13 and CD=3, legs BC=10 and AD=10. Wait, but AD is given as 10 cm. Let me confirm.

But hold on, the trapezoid is ABCD. Let me sketch mentally: Points A, B, C, D arranged such that AB is connected to B, which connects to C, which connects to D, which connects back to A. Given that AB is 13, BC is 10, CD is 3, DA is 10. Also, BC is perpendicular to AB and CD. So AB ⊥ BC and BC ⊥ CD. Therefore, AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, so AB is parallel to CD. Thus, AB and CD are the two bases of the trapezoid. The height of the trapezoid is the distance between AB and CD, which would be the length of BC, since BC is perpendicular to both. Wait, but BC is 10 cm. So the height of the trapezoid is 10 cm. But then the legs are BC and AD. Wait, but AD is also 10 cm. So AD is another leg. Wait, but in a right trapezoid, only one of the legs is perpendicular to the bases. Wait, but here both BC and AD are perpendicular? Wait, no. Wait, BC is perpendicular to AB and CD, so BC is perpendicular to the bases. What about AD? Is AD perpendicular to anything?

Wait, the problem says "the trapezoid surface has edges of 3cm, 10cm and 13cm." Wait, the edges of the trapezoid. The trapezoid has four edges: AB=13, BC=10, CD=3, DA=10. But in a trapezoid, the two bases are AB and CD (since they are parallel), with lengths 13 and 3. The legs are BC and DA, each 10 cm. However, in a right trapezoid, only one of the legs is perpendicular to the bases. But here, BC is perpendicular to AB and CD, so BC is perpendicular to the bases. But DA is not necessarily perpendicular. Wait, unless DA is also perpendicular. Wait, but DA connects D to A. If AB is parallel to CD, then DA is connecting the ends of the two bases. Let me think.

Let me try to visualize coordinates. Suppose we assign coordinates to the trapezoid. Let me set point B at (0,0). Since BC is perpendicular to AB, and assuming AB is horizontal. Wait, if AB is horizontal and BC is vertical. Let me define coordinates:

Let’s assume point B is at (0, 0). Since AB is 13 cm long, and AB is horizontal (assuming BC is vertical). Then point A would be at (13, 0). Now, BC is 10 cm long and perpendicular to AB, so BC goes upward from B (0,0) along the y-axis. So point C is at (0,10). Then CD is 3 cm long, and since CD is perpendicular to BC (which is vertical), CD must be horizontal. Since CD is part of the trapezoid, going from C(0,10) horizontally. But direction? Since CD is a side of the trapezoid. Since AB and CD are parallel, and AB is horizontal, CD should also be horizontal. So from point C(0,10), moving horizontally to D. The length CD is 3 cm. But direction? To make the trapezoid close properly, D needs to connect back to A(13,0). Let me see.

If CD is horizontal, then from point C(0,10), moving left or right. If CD is to the left, then D would be at (-3,10). Then DA connects D(-3,10) to A(13,0). The length of DA is supposed to be 10 cm. Let me check the distance between (-3,10) and (13,0):

Distance squared is (13 - (-3))² + (0 - 10)² = (16)² + (-10)² = 256 + 100 = 356. Square root of 356 ≈ 18.87, which is not 10. That contradicts the given length of DA being 10 cm. So my assumption about direction might be wrong.

Alternatively, if CD is to the right from point C(0,10). Then D would be at (3,10). Then DA connects D(3,10) to A(13,0). Distance between (3,10) and (13,0):

Difference in x: 13 - 3 = 10, difference in y: 0 - 10 = -10. So distance sqrt(10² + 10²) = sqrt(200) ≈ 14.14 cm. Which is not 10 cm. Still doesn't match. So something's wrong here.

Hmm. So according to the given data, DA is 10 cm. So maybe my coordinate system isn't correct. Perhaps the trapezoid is not right-angled at both B and D? Wait, the problem states that BC is perpendicular to AB and CD. So BC is perpendicular to AB and to CD. Therefore, AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, hence AB || CD. But DA is the other leg. How does DA fit in?

Wait, maybe DA is not perpendicular. In that case, the trapezoid is a right trapezoid with one right angle at B and another at C? Wait, but BC is perpendicular to AB and CD. So at point B, AB and BC meet at a right angle. At point C, BC and CD meet at a right angle. So the trapezoid has two right angles at B and C. But then DA is the fourth side. Let me try again with coordinates.

Let me take B at (0,0). AB is horizontal, length 13, so A is at (13,0). BC is vertical upwards from B, length 10, so C is at (0,10). CD is horizontal from C, since it's perpendicular to BC (vertical), so CD is horizontal. Since CD is length 3, then D is either to the left or right of C. Let me suppose D is at (x,10). Since CD is 3 units long, so |x - 0| = 3. So x could be 3 or -3. Let me try x=3 first. Then D is at (3,10). Then DA connects D(3,10) to A(13,0). The length of DA is sqrt((13-3)^2 + (0-10)^2) = sqrt(100 + 100) = sqrt(200) ≈ 14.14 cm. But the given length of DA is 10 cm. Not matching. So that can't be.

If x=-3, then D is at (-3,10). Then DA connects (-3,10) to (13,0). The length is sqrt((13 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 10)^2) = sqrt(16² + (-10)^2) = sqrt(256 + 100) = sqrt(356) ≈ 18.87 cm. Also not 10 cm. So this suggests inconsistency. Wait, but according to the given predicates, DA is 10 cm. So where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait, maybe the order of the points is different. Maybe the trapezoid is not ordered as A-B-C-D-A. Maybe it's A-B-C-D-A, but with different connections. Wait, the trapezoid is defined as Trapezoid(A,B,C,D), so the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So the order is important. If AB is connected to B, then BC is connected to C, CD to D, DA back to A. So the shape is A-B-C-D-A. 

Given that, with AB=13, BC=10, CD=3, DA=10. And BC is perpendicular to AB and CD. So AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, so AB || CD. Therefore, AB and CD are the two bases of the trapezoid. Then the height of the trapezoid is BC=10 cm. But then DA is the other leg, which is slanting. However, according to the given data, DA is 10 cm. So how can we reconcile this?

Maybe I made a wrong assumption about the orientation. Let me consider that BC is vertical, AB is horizontal. Then CD is horizontal. But if AB is longer than CD, then the projection of AD onto the horizontal axis would account for the difference in the bases.

Wait, let me think algebraically. Let me denote the coordinates again. Let me take B at (0,0), AB along x-axis to A(13,0). BC is vertical up to C(0,10). CD is horizontal from C(0,10) to D. Since CD has length 3, D is at (3,10) or (-3,10). But DA connects D to A(13,0). The length DA is 10. So let's write equations.

Case 1: D is at (3,10). Then DA vector is (13-3, 0-10) = (10, -10). Length is sqrt(10² + (-10)²) = sqrt(200) ≈ 14.14 ≠ 10. Not good.

Case 2: D is at (-3,10). Then DA vector is (13 - (-3), 0 - 10) = (16, -10). Length sqrt(16² + (-10)^2) = sqrt(256 + 100) = sqrt(356) ≈ 18.87 ≠ 10. Still no.

So this suggests that my initial coordinate setup is incorrect. Maybe BC is not aligned vertically? Wait, but the problem states that Line(B,C) is perpendicular to Line(A,B) and Line(C,D). So BC is perpendicular to AB and to CD. Therefore, AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, implying they are parallel. So AB || CD. Hence, AB and CD are the two bases. But then, given AB=13, CD=3, BC=10, DA=10. How to find coordinates where DA=10?

Alternative approach: Let me model the trapezoid as follows. Since AB || CD, and BC is perpendicular to both, making BC the height. So the height h = BC = 10 cm. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is (base1 + base2)/2 * height. But maybe that's not directly helpful yet.

But the problem refers to the trapezoid having edges of 3 cm, 10 cm, and 13 cm. Wait, the edges are AB=13, BC=10, CD=3, DA=10. So the edges are 13,10,3,10. So the trapezoid has sides of lengths 13,10,3,10. But how does that work with the right angles?

Wait, maybe the trapezoid is not convex? Or perhaps I'm missing something else. Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is not right-angled, but the given perpendicularity implies that. Wait, the problem says "the trapezoid surface" – perhaps referring to the lateral face? Wait no, the question says "the trapezoid surface has edges of 3cm, 10cm and 13cm". Wait, but a trapezoid has four edges. Maybe it's referring to three of them? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it should say "edges of 3cm, 10cm, 10cm, and 13cm"? Or maybe it's considering the perimeter?

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoidal prism has a trapezoidal face with edges 3, 10, and 13. But a trapezoid has four sides. Maybe it's referring to the three non-parallel sides? Or perhaps the problem statement is slightly ambiguous. However, given the predicates, the lengths of the trapezoid's sides are AB=13, BC=10, CD=3, DA=10. So the trapezoid has sides of 13, 10, 3, 10. So that's four sides. 

But earlier attempts to assign coordinates didn't satisfy DA=10. There must be an error in my assumptions. Let me re-examine the problem. 

Wait, the problem mentions "the right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm". So one of the rectangular faces is a right rectangle, meaning it's a square or rectangle. But the edges are 3 and 10. So that rectangle has sides 3 and 10. Since it's a right rectangle, it's a rectangle. So that face is one of the lateral faces of the prism. 

A trapezoidal prism has two trapezoidal bases and three rectangular lateral faces. Wait, no: a trapezoidal prism has two congruent trapezoids and three rectangles? Wait, actually, no. Wait, a trapezoidal prism has two trapezoidal bases and three rectangular lateral faces? Or is it two trapezoidal bases and three rectangles? Wait, no. A prism has two congruent bases connected by parallelograms. Since it's a trapezoidal prism, the lateral faces are rectangles if it's a right prism. Otherwise, they could be parallelograms. But the problem mentions a "right rectangle surface", which may imply that one of the lateral faces is a rectangle. Wait, but the problem says "the right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm". So one of the rectangular faces has sides 3 and 10. 

But in a trapezoidal prism, the lateral faces are rectangles if it's a right prism, meaning the lateral edges are perpendicular to the bases. However, if it's an oblique prism, the lateral faces are parallelograms. However, the problem mentions a "right rectangle surface", suggesting that it's a right prism. So the lateral faces are rectangles.

Therefore, the trapezoidal prism has two trapezoidal bases and three rectangular lateral faces. Wait, no, a prism with a trapezoidal base has two trapezoidal bases and three rectangular lateral faces? Wait, no. Wait, a prism has as many lateral faces as the number of sides of the base polygon. Since the base is a trapezoid (a quadrilateral), the prism has two trapezoidal bases and two rectangular lateral faces? No, wait. A prism with n-sided base has n rectangular lateral faces. So a trapezoidal prism (quadrilateral base) has two trapezoidal bases and four rectangular lateral faces. Wait, no. Wait, no. The lateral faces are between each pair of corresponding sides of the two bases. For example, in a triangular prism, you have two triangular bases and three rectangular faces. So for a trapezoidal prism (base is a trapezoid, which has four sides), there are two trapezoidal bases and four rectangular lateral faces. But the problem mentions only three rectangles? Wait, the problem says "the right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm". Maybe there are three rectangular faces, but one of them is specified? Or maybe the problem is referring to the lateral surfaces. 

But regardless, to calculate the total surface area, we need the areas of both trapezoidal bases and the areas of all lateral faces. 

However, let's focus on the given data. The problem mentions that the trapezoid surface has edges of 3cm, 10cm, and 13cm. Wait, but a trapezoid has four edges. So maybe it's referring to the three sides that are not the height? Or maybe there was a translation error. Alternatively, perhaps the trapezoid has three sides mentioned: AB=13, BC=10, CD=3, and DA=10. But the problem says "has edges of 3cm, 10cm and 13cm". So maybe it's saying that among its edges, there are three different lengths: 3, 10, and 13. 

But in our case, the trapezoid has edges of 13, 10, 3, and 10. So the edges are 13, 10, 3, and 10. So the three distinct lengths are 3, 10, and 13. So that matches the problem's description. 

Now, returning to the coordinates issue. Why is DA not matching? Let me think differently. Since BC is perpendicular to AB and CD, and AB || CD, then the trapezoid is right-angled at B and C. Therefore, the legs are BC and... Well, in a right trapezoid, only one of the legs is perpendicular. Wait, no—if both AB and CD are perpendicular to BC, then both AB and CD are perpendicular to BC, making them parallel to each other. So BC is a leg, and AD is the other leg. Wait, but in this case, AD is not necessarily perpendicular. 

Wait, but if AB and CD are both perpendicular to BC, then AB is parallel to CD, and BC is the height. Then AD connects A to D. Let me think of AB and CD as the two bases. The length of AB is 13, CD is 3. The height is BC = 10. The other leg DA is slanting. So to find DA, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. 

Wait, the difference between the lengths of AB and CD is 13 - 3 = 10. This difference corresponds to the horizontal component between the two bases. Since AB is longer than CD by 10 units, and the height is 10 units, then DA forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 10 and 10. Hence, DA would be sqrt(10² + 10²) = sqrt(200) ≈ 14.14 cm. But according to the given data, DA is 10 cm. Contradiction. So there's an inconsistency here. 

This suggests that either my understanding is wrong, or there's an error in the problem's data. Wait, but the problem gives us DA as 10 cm. Let me check again. The given predicates include LengthOf(Line(A,D),10). So DA is indeed 10 cm. So there's a contradiction here. How is this possible?

Wait, maybe the trapezoid is not right-angled at B and C. Wait, but the problem states that Line(B,C) is perpendicular to Line(A,B) and Line(C,D). So BC is perpendicular to AB and CD. Therefore, AB is perpendicular to BC, and CD is perpendicular to BC. Hence, AB || CD. Therefore, the trapezoid is right-angled at B and C. Hence, DA is the other leg, which in this case, as per previous calculation, should be sqrt( (AB - CD)^2 + BC^2 )? Wait, no. Let me think.

Imagine extending the bases AB and CD until they meet at a point, forming a triangle. But since it's a trapezoid, they don't meet. Instead, the difference in the lengths of the bases creates a right triangle. Let me consider projecting point D onto AB. If AB is length 13, CD is length 3, and the height is BC=10. Then the horizontal distance between the projections of D and A would be 13 - 3 = 10. Hence, DA would be the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs 10 (height) and 10 (horizontal difference), giving DA = sqrt(10² + 10²) = sqrt(200). But DA is given as 10 cm. This is conflicting. 

Wait, but maybe the height is not 10 cm? Wait, BC is perpendicular to AB and CD, so the height of the trapezoid is BC=10 cm. So this seems fixed. Hence, the calculation suggests DA should be sqrt(200), but the given data says DA is 10 cm. This discrepancy indicates that there's an error in the problem setup or my interpretation. 

Alternatively, perhaps BC is not the height? Wait, no—since BC is perpendicular to AB and CD, it is the height. 

Wait, maybe the trapezoid is not a right trapezoid? But the problem says BC is perpendicular to AB and CD. So it must be a right trapezoid. 

Wait, maybe the trapezoid is not convex? Or perhaps the labeling of the points is different. Let me try assigning coordinates again, taking into account that DA is 10 cm. 

Let me denote AB = 13, BC = 10, CD = 3, DA = 10. Let me consider vectors. Let me assume that AB is along x-axis from A to B. Let me take point A at (0,0). Then point B would be at (13,0). BC is perpendicular to AB, so BC is vertical. Let me assume it goes upward from B. So point C is at (13,10). Now, CD is perpendicular to BC, so CD is horizontal. CD has length 3. So from point C(13,10), moving left or right. If moving left, D is at (13 - 3, 10) = (10,10). Then DA connects D(10,10) to A(0,0). The length DA would be sqrt((10-0)^2 + (10-0)^2) = sqrt(100 + 100) = sqrt(200) ≈ 14.14 cm. Again, not 10 cm. 

If CD is to the right from C(13,10), then D is at (13 + 3, 10) = (16,10). Then DA connects (16,10) to (0,0), length sqrt(16² + 10²) = sqrt(256 + 100) = sqrt(356) ≈ 18.87 cm. Still not matching. 

This suggests that with BC as the vertical leg, DA cannot be 10 cm. Hence, there must be a different configuration. Perhaps BC is not vertical? But the problem states that BC is perpendicular to AB and CD. So if AB is not horizontal, then BC would have a different direction. Let me try to find coordinates where DA=10 cm.

Let me denote AB as a vector and BC as another. Let me consider AB vector and BC vector are perpendicular. Let me let AB be a vector (a,b), and BC be a vector (c,d), with AB · BC = 0. Also, CD is perpendicular to BC, so CD vector is scalar multiple of AB vector. 

But this might get complicated. Let me try setting AB as a vector and BC as a perpendicular vector. 

Let me assume AB is vector u, BC is vector v, with u · v = 0. Then CD is parallel to AB, since it's perpendicular to BC. So CD is a scalar multiple of u. 

Let me assign coordinates accordingly. Let me take point A at origin (0,0). Point B is at vector u = (u_x, u_y). Then vector AB is u, so B is at (u_x, u_y). Vector BC is v, which is perpendicular to u. So v · u = 0. Let me choose v as (v_x, v_y) such that v_x * u_x + v_y * u_y = 0. 

Then point C is at B + v = (u_x + v_x, u_y + v_y). CD is a vector parallel to AB, so it's k*u, where k is a scalar. The length of CD is 3, so |k*u| = 3. 

Then point D is at C + k*u = (u_x + v_x + k*u_x, u_y + v_y + k*u_y). 

Finally, DA is the vector from D to A, which is (- (u_x + v_x + k*u_x), - (u_y + v_y + k*u_y)), and its magnitude is 10. 

Also, the length of AB is |u| = 13, so sqrt(u_x² + u_y²) = 13. The length of BC is |v| = 10, so sqrt(v_x² + v_y²) = 10. The length of CD is |k*u| = 3, so |k| * |u| = 3 → |k| = 3 / 13. 

Let me assume k is positive. So k = 3/13. 

Now, the vector DA is from D to A: A - D = -D = -(u_x + v_x + k*u_x, u_y + v_y + k*u_y). So the length of DA is sqrt[(u_x + v_x + k*u_x)^2 + (u_y + v_y + k*u_y)^2]^2 = 10^2 = 100. 

Expanding this expression:

[u_x(1 + k) + v_x]^2 + [u_y(1 + k) + v_y]^2 = 100.

But since u and v are perpendicular, u · v = 0. Let me expand the squares:

Let me denote s = 1 + k. Then the expression becomes:

[s u_x + v_x]^2 + [s u_y + v_y]^2 = s² (u_x² + u_y²) + 2s (u_x v_x + u_y v_y) + (v_x² + v_y²).

Since u · v = 0, the middle term disappears. So:

s² |u|² + |v|² = 100.

We know |u| = 13, |v| = 10, and s = 1 + k = 1 + 3/13 = 16/13.

Substituting:

(16/13)^2 * 13² + 10² = ?

Calculate:

(256/169)*169 + 100 = 256 + 100 = 356.

Which equals 356. But the required value is 100. This is a contradiction. 

This suggests that under the given conditions, DA cannot be 10 cm. Therefore, there's an inconsistency in the problem's data. But since the problem provides DA as 10 cm, I must have made an incorrect assumption. 

Wait, perhaps the trapezoid is not right-angled at B and C? But the problem says Line(B,C) is perpendicular to Line(A,B) and Line(C,D), which would mean it's right-angled at B and C. 

Alternatively, maybe the trapezoid is not convex? Or perhaps the trapezoid is folded in a way that DA is not the diagonal? This is getting too abstract. Maybe I need to abandon coordinate geometry and instead use the given lengths to compute the surface area directly.

The question asks for the surface area of the trapezoidal prism. The surface area includes the areas of the two trapezoidal bases and the areas of the three rectangular lateral faces (assuming it's a right prism). Wait, but earlier we saw that the lateral faces might include more than three. Wait, in a trapezoidal prism, there are two trapezoidal bases and three rectangular lateral faces? No, as explained earlier, for a quadrilateral base, there are two trapezoidal bases and four rectangular lateral faces. But the problem mentions "the right rectangle surface" — perhaps one of the rectangular faces is specified. 

But given the confusion in calculating DA, maybe I should proceed with the given data and calculate the areas directly.

The surface area S = 2*(area of trapezoid) + (sum of areas of lateral faces).

First, calculate the area of the trapezoid. For a trapezoid with bases AB=13 and CD=3, and height h=BC=10 (since BC is perpendicular to the bases). So area = (13 + 3)/2 * 10 = 16/2 * 10 = 8*10 = 80 cm². So two trapezoidal bases contribute 2*80 = 160 cm².

Next, calculate the areas of the lateral faces. These are rectangles whose heights are the same as the height of the prism (which is the same as the height of the trapezoid, 10 cm?), or wait, no. Wait, in a prism, the lateral faces are rectangles with one side equal to the height of the prism (which is the length between the two bases), and the other side equal to the length of each side of the trapezoid. Wait, no, the lateral faces are rectangles formed by translating each side of the trapezoid into the third dimension. 

Wait, in a prism, each edge of the base is connected to the corresponding edge of the other base via a rectangle. So for a trapezoidal prism, the lateral faces are:

- Two rectangles corresponding to the two bases' sides (AB and CD) with height equal to the height of the prism (but what is the height of the prism? Wait, in prisms, the height is the distance between the two bases. But in this case, since it's a right prism, the lateral edges (connecting the two bases) are perpendicular to the bases. However, the problem doesn't mention the height of the prism. Wait, but the problem mentions a "right rectangle surface" with edges 3cm and 10cm. Perhaps this refers to one of the lateral faces. 

Wait, the problem says "the right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm". So one of the rectangular lateral faces has sides 3cm and 10cm. Since the trapezoid has sides of 3cm (CD), 10cm (BC), 13cm (AB), and 10cm (DA). Wait, but BC is perpendicular to AB and CD, so BC is one of the lateral edges of the prism? Or is it part of the trapezoid?

Wait, in the trapezoidal prism, the lateral faces are rectangles. Each lateral face corresponds to a side of the trapezoid. For example, the side AB of the trapezoid would form a rectangle with height equal to the height of the prism. Wait, but what is the height of the prism? 

Actually, in a prism, the height of the prism is the distance between the two trapezoidal bases. If it's a right prism, this height is the same as the length of the lateral edges. But without additional information, we might need to infer it from the given data. 

Wait, the problem mentions "the right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm". One of the rectangular faces has sides 3cm and 10cm. Since the trapezoid has a side CD of 3cm, and if this is paired with the height of the prism (let's call it h), then the rectangle would have dimensions 3cm × h. But the problem says the edges are 3cm and 10cm. So h must be 10cm. Hence, the height of the prism is 10cm. 

Thus, each lateral face is a rectangle with one side equal to the length of a side of the trapezoid and the other equal to the height of the prism (10cm). 

Wait, but the trapezoid has four sides: AB=13, BC=10, CD=3, DA=10. So the lateral faces would be:

1. Rectangle corresponding to AB: length AB=13, height=10 → area 13×10=130 cm²
2. Rectangle corresponding to BC: length BC=10, height=10 → area 10×10=100 cm²
3. Rectangle corresponding to CD: length CD=3, height=10 → area 3×10=30 cm²
4. Rectangle corresponding to DA: length DA=10, height=10 → area 10×10=100 cm²

But wait, this would give total lateral surface area as 130 + 100 + 30 + 100 = 360 cm². Adding the two trapezoidal bases (total 160 cm²), the total surface area would be 360 + 160 = 520 cm². But let me verify if this aligns with the given data.

But the problem mentions "the right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm". One of the lateral faces is a rectangle with sides 3cm and 10cm, which matches the CD×height. So this is consistent. 

However, there's still the issue with DA being 10 cm. According to the earlier calculation, DA should be sqrt(200), but the problem says DA=10. However, if we proceed with the given data, assuming that DA=10 cm, then the lateral faces would include DA×height=10×10=100 cm². 

Thus, proceeding with this, the total surface area would be 2*80 + 130 + 100 + 30 + 100 = 160 + 360 = 520 cm². But let me check if this is correct. 

But wait, the problem says "the trapezoid surface has edges of 3cm, 10cm and 13cm". The trapezoid has edges AB=13, BC=10, CD=3, DA=10. So three of the edges are 3, 10, and 13, which matches. 

But why does DA=10 cm? Earlier calculations suggested it should be sqrt(200), but perhaps in this context, the prism's height is not the same as the height of the trapezoid? Wait, no. In a right prism, the lateral edges are perpendicular to the bases, so the height of the prism is the same as the height of the trapezoid. Wait, but in this case, the height of the trapezoid is BC=10 cm, which is one of the sides. But if the prism's height is the same as the trapezoid's height, then DA would be the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the difference in the bases and the height. 

Wait, but earlier calculations showed that DA should be sqrt( (AB - CD)^2 + BC^2 ) = sqrt( (13-3)^2 + 10^2 ) = sqrt(100 + 100) = sqrt(200). But according to the given data, DA=10. This suggests that either the prism is not a right prism, or there's a miscalculation. 

But the problem mentions "the right rectangle surface", which implies it's a right prism. Hence, the height of the prism is the same as the height of the trapezoid, which is BC=10. Thus, DA should be sqrt( (AB - CD)^2 + BC^2 ). But since this conflicts with DA=10, there's an inconsistency. 

However, since the problem provides DA=10, perhaps we are to ignore this inconsistency and proceed with the given data. Hence, even though mathematically DA should be sqrt(200), we'll use DA=10 as given. 

Assuming that, the surface area calculation proceeds as before: 2*80 + 130 + 100 + 30 + 100 = 520 cm². 

But let me double-check. If DA=10, then the lateral face corresponding to DA is 10×10=100. The other lateral faces are 13×10=130, 10×10=100, 3×10=30. Total lateral area: 130+100+30+100=360. Plus 2*80=160. Total SA=520. 

But wait, the problem says "surface area of the trapezoidal prism". However, in a trapezoidal prism, the two trapezoidal bases are included, and the lateral faces. So this seems correct. 

But the given data might have inconsistencies, but since the problem provides DA=10, we proceed. Hence, the surface area is 520 cm². Rounded to one decimal place, it remains 520.0. But let me check if there's any other factor I missed. 

Wait, another thought: the problem mentions three rectangles: Rectangle(1), Rectangle(2), Rectangle(3). Maybe these correspond to the three rectangular faces, and the fourth lateral face is a parallelogram? But the problem mentions "the right rectangle surface", implying that one of the lateral faces is a rectangle, while others might be parallelograms. But if it's a right prism, all lateral faces are rectangles. Hence, there should be four rectangular faces. 

But the problem says "the right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm". So one of the rectangles has sides 3 and 10. Others might have different dimensions. 

In this case, with DA=10, the four lateral faces are: AB=13×10, BC=10×10, CD=3×10, DA=10×10. Hence, total lateral area: 13×10 + 10×10 + 3×10 + 10×10 = 130 + 100 + 30 + 100 = 360. Add twice the trapezoid area: 2*80=160. Total SA=520. 

But let me confirm the trapezoid area. With bases 13 and 3, height 10: area=(13+3)/2 * 10 = 16/2 * 10 = 8*10=80. Correct. 

Hence, the total surface area is 520 cm². 

But the problem says "to the nearest one decimal place". Since 520 is an integer, it would be 520.0. So the final answer is 520.0. 

But wait, let me check once more for errors. If DA is 10, then the trapezoid has sides AB=13, BC=10, CD=3, DA=10. The area calculation assumes that the height is BC=10, which is valid because BC is perpendicular to the bases. Even though DA is not perpendicular, the height of the trapezoid is still BC. Hence, the area calculation holds. 

Yes, the height of a trapezoid is the distance between the two bases, which is the length of the leg that is perpendicular to them, which is BC=10. Hence, the area is correctly computed as 80. 

Thus, the total surface area is 520 cm².

### 🧩 **Step 1: Understanding the Structure**

We are told the prism is **trapezoidal**, which means it has two **congruent trapezoidal bases** and **rectangular lateral faces**. The trapezoid has:

- Side lengths:  
  - $ AB = 13 $ cm  
  - $ BC = 10 $ cm  
  - $ CD = 3 $ cm  
  - $ DA = 10 $ cm  

It is also stated that:
- $ \overline{BC} \perp \overline{AB} $
- $ \overline{BC} \perp \overline{CD} $

From these perpendicular relationships, we conclude that $ AB \parallel CD $, and thus the trapezoid is a **right trapezoid** with height $ BC = 10 $ cm.

### 📐 **Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Trapezoid Base**

Using the standard formula for the area of a trapezoid:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{trapezoid}} = \frac{(AB + CD)}{2} \cdot \text{height}
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{trapezoid}} = \frac{(13 + 3)}{2} \cdot 10 = \frac{16}{2} \cdot 10 = 8 \cdot 10 = 80 \text{ cm}^2
$$

Since there are two identical trapezoidal bases, the total area contributed by them is:

$$
2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ cm}^2
$$

---

### 📐 **Step 3: Calculate the Lateral Surface Area**

Each lateral face of the prism corresponds to one of the sides of the trapezoid, extended vertically (in the third dimension). The **height of the prism** is the **same as the height of the trapezoid**, which is $ 10 $ cm (from the perpendicular segment $ BC $).

Thus, the lateral surface consists of four rectangles:

1. $ AB = 13 $ cm, height = 10 cm → Area = $ 13 \times 10 = 130 $ cm²  
2. $ BC = 10 $ cm, height = 10 cm → Area = $ 10 \times 10 = 10
