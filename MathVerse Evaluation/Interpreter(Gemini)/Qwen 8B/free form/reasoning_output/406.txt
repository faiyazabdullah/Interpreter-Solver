<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to find the area of a sector given some information. Let me recall what I know about sectors. A sector is like a slice of a circle, right? So the area of a sector depends on the radius and the central angle. 

The problem says that the radius of the figure is 56.5 meters. Wait, so OA and OB are both radii of the circle, and their lengths are given as 56.5 meters each. That makes sense because OA and OB are both radii of the same circle centered at O. Also, the measure of angle AOB is 123 degrees. 

So the formula for the area of a sector is... hmm, I think it's (θ/360) times πr². Yeah, that sounds right. Because if θ was 360 degrees, the whole circle, then the area would be πr². So for any angle θ, you take the fraction of the circle that the sector covers, which is θ over 360 degrees, multiplied by the total area of the circle.

Let me write down the values. The radius r is 56.5 meters. The central angle θ is 123 degrees. So plugging into the formula:

Area = (θ / 360) * π * r²

First, compute θ divided by 360. Let me calculate that. 123 divided by 360. Let me do that division. Well, 123 ÷ 360 equals... maybe approximately 0.341666... repeating. But I can keep it as a fraction for more accuracy. Alternatively, just compute the numerical value directly.

But since the question asks for the answer correct to two decimal places, I should probably compute it numerically. Let me check if there's another way. Maybe I can use radians? Wait, but the angle is given in degrees here, so I should stick with degrees unless told otherwise. 

Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as (1/2) * r² * θ where θ is in radians. Oh, right! There are two formulas depending on whether the angle is in degrees or radians. Since we have degrees, we can use either method. Let me confirm:

If θ is in degrees, then Area = (θ/360) * πr². If θ is in radians, then Area = (1/2)*r²*θ. So since our angle is given in degrees, we'll use the first formula. 

So let me proceed with that. Plugging in the numbers:

First, compute θ / 360: 123 / 360. Let me calculate that. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 3: 41 / 120 ≈ 0.341666...

Then multiply by π and r squared. Let me compute r squared first. The radius is 56.5 meters. Squaring that: 56.5². Let me compute that. 

Well, 56 squared is 3136. Then 0.5 squared is 0.25, and cross terms: 2*56*0.5 = 56. So (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b² where a=56, b=0.5. Therefore, 56.5² = 56² + 2*56*0.5 + 0.5² = 3136 + 56 + 0.25 = 3192.25. Let me verify with direct calculation: 56.5 * 56.5. Alternatively, note that 56.5 * 56.5 = (56 + 0.5)^2 = 56^2 + 2*56*0.5 + 0.5^2 = 3136 + 56 + 0.25 = 3192.25. Yes, that's correct.

So r² is 3192.25 m². Then multiply by π. Let me note that. Then multiply by θ/360, which is approx 0.341666...

So putting it all together:

Area = 0.341666... * π * 3192.25

Alternatively, compute 123/360 * π * 3192.25. Let me compute that step by step.

First, let me calculate 123/360. Simplify the fraction. Both 123 and 360 are divisible by 3. 123 ÷ 3 = 41, 360 ÷ 3 = 120. So 41/120. So the exact fraction is 41/120. 

Therefore, Area = (41/120) * π * 3192.25

Alternatively, compute 41 * 3192.25 / 120 * π. Let me compute 41 * 3192.25 first. Hmm, that might be tedious. Alternatively, perhaps compute 3192.25 * 41 first?

Wait, let me think of another approach. Maybe compute the entire value step by step numerically.

First, compute 123 divided by 360. Let me get a decimal value. 123 divided by 360. Let me do that division. 123 ÷ 360. Since 360 goes into 123 zero times, add decimal points. 360 into 1230 is 3 times (since 3*360=1080). Subtract 1080 from 1230 gives 150. Bring down a zero: 1500. 360 goes into 1500 four times (4*360=1440). Subtract gives 60. Bring down a zero: 600. 360 goes into 600 once (1*360=360). Subtract gives 240. Bring down a zero: 2400. 360 goes into 2400 six times (6*360=2160). Subtract gives 240. So we see repetition here. So the decimal expansion is 0.341666..., with the 6 repeating. So approximately 0.341666...

So multiplying this by π * r². Let me compute π * r² first. π * 3192.25. Let me approximate π as 3.1416. So 3.1416 * 3192.25. Let me compute that. First, 3 * 3192.25 = 9576.75. Then 0.1416 * 3192.25. Let me compute 0.1 * 3192.25 = 319.225, 0.04 * 3192.25 = 127.69, 0.0016 * 3192.25 ≈ 5.1076. Adding those up: 319.225 + 127.69 = 446.915 + 5.1076 ≈ 452.0226. So total π*r² ≈ 9576.75 + 452.0226 ≈ 10028.7726 m². 

Now multiply that by 0.341666... So 10028.7726 * 0.341666...

Hmm, let me compute that. Let me approximate 0.341666... as roughly 0.3416667. Let me compute 10028.7726 * 0.3416667.

Breaking it down:

First, note that 0.3416667 is equal to 123/360. So alternatively, maybe compute 10028.7726 * 123 / 360. Let me try that.

Compute 10028.7726 * 123. Let me compute that. Let me break down 123 as 120 + 3.

So 10028.7726 * 120 = ?

First, 10028.7726 * 100 = 1,002,877.26

Then 10028.7726 * 20 = 200,575.452

Adding them together: 1,002,877.26 + 200,575.452 = 1,203,452.712

Then add 10028.7726 * 3 = 30,086.3178

Total is 1,203,452.712 + 30,086.3178 = 1,233,539.0298

Now divide by 360: 1,233,539.0298 / 360 ≈ ?

Dividing by 360: Let me divide by 36 first, then by 10.

1,233,539.0298 ÷ 36. Let me compute that. 

Well, 36 * 34,000 = 1,224,000. So subtract 1,224,000 from 1,233,539.0298: that leaves 9,539.0298.

Now divide 9,539.0298 by 36. Let me estimate. 36 * 264 = 9,504. So 264 * 36 = 9,504. Then remaining is 9,539.0298 - 9,504 = 35.0298. So total is 34,000 + 264 + (35.0298 / 36) ≈ 34,264 + ~0.973. So approximately 34,264.973. Then divide by 10 (because earlier we divided by 36 and then need to divide by 10): so 34,264.973 / 10 = 3,426.4973. So approximately 3,426.5 square meters?

Wait, but that seems too low. Wait, let me check again. Because my initial steps may have errors. Let me retrace.

Wait, the value after multiplying 10028.7726 by 123 gave me 1,233,539.0298. Divided by 360. Let me check that again. 

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing π * r². Let me double-check that part. Earlier, I had r² = 3192.25 m². Then π * r² ≈ 3.1416 * 3192.25. Let me recalculate that.

Let me use calculator-like steps. 3.1416 × 3192.25. Let me compute 3 × 3192.25 = 9576.75. Then 0.1416 × 3192.25. Let me compute 0.1 × 3192.25 = 319.225. 0.04 × 3192.25 = 127.69. 0.0016 × 3192.25 ≈ 5.1076. So adding these three components: 319.225 + 127.69 = 446.915 + 5.1076 ≈ 452.0226. So total is 9576.75 + 452.0226 = 10028.7726. So that part is correct. 

Then multiplying by 123 gives us 10028.7726 × 123. Which I calculated as 1,233,539.0298. Then dividing by 360 gives approximately 3,426.497. So the area is approximately 3,426.5 m²? Wait, but let me check if that's accurate. Let me consider that 123/360 is approximately 0.341666..., and πr² is approximately 10028.7726. Multiplying 10028.7726 × 0.341666... 

Another way: 10028.7726 × 0.341666... ≈ 10028.7726 × 0.341666... Let me use a better approximation for the decimal. Let me take 0.341666... as 0.3416666667.

So 10028.7726 × 0.3416666667. Let me approximate this multiplication. Let me use a calculator method.

First, approximate 10028.7726 × 0.34 = ?

Well, 10028.7726 × 0.3 = 3008.63178

10028.7726 × 0.04 = 401.150904

Adding them gives 3008.63178 + 401.150904 = 3409.782684

Then, the remaining part is 0.0016666667 × 10028.7726. Let me compute that. 0.0016666667 is approximately 1/600. So 10028.7726 / 600 ≈ 16.714621.

So total area ≈ 3409.782684 + 16.714621 ≈ 3426.4973 m². So approximately 3426.5 m². Rounding to two decimal places, that would be 3426.50 m²? Wait, but wait—let me check if that's precise enough.

But hold on, maybe I should carry out more precise calculations. However, considering that the original numbers have specific precisions. Let me check if there's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute using fractions. Let me try that. Since θ is 123°, and r is 56.5 m.

Formula: Area = (θ/360) × π × r²

Plugging in θ = 123°, r = 56.5:

Area = (123/360) × π × (56.5)^2

We can compute this step by step with decimals.

First, compute 56.5 squared: 56.5 × 56.5 = 3192.25 as before.

Then compute 123/360. Let me compute that as a decimal. As before, 123 divided by 360 equals 0.341666...

Multiply that by π × 3192.25. Let me use a more accurate value of π, say 3.14159265.

So π × 3192.25 = 3.14159265 × 3192.25. Let me compute that:

First, 3 × 3192.25 = 9576.75

Then 0.14159265 × 3192.25. Let me compute that:

Breakdown 0.1 × 3192.25 = 319.225

0.04 × 3192.25 = 127.69

0.00159265 × 3192.25 ≈ Let's compute 0.001 × 3192.25 = 3.19225, and 0.00059265 × 3192.25 ≈ approx 3192.25 × 0.00059265 ≈ Let me compute 3192.25 × 0.0006 = 1.91535, then subtract 3192.25 × 0.00000735 ≈ negligible. So approx 1.91535 - small amount ≈ 1.91. So total for 0.00159265 × ... ≈ 3.19225 + 1.91 ≈ 5.10225.

So adding all parts for 0.14159265 × 3192.25 ≈ 319.225 + 127.69 + 5.10225 ≈ 319.225 + 127.69 = 446.915 + 5.10225 ≈ 452.01725.

Thus, π × r² ≈ 9576.75 + 452.01725 ≈ 10028.76725.

Now multiply by 0.341666...

So 10028.76725 × 0.341666... Let me use a calculator-like approach here. Let me consider that 0.341666... is equal to 123/360. So 10028.76725 × 123 / 360.

Let me compute 10028.76725 × 123 first. Let me do this multiplication accurately.

As before, breaking into 120 + 3:

10028.76725 × 120 = ?

Well, 10028.76725 × 100 = 1,002,876.725

10028.76725 × 20 = 200,575.345

Add them: 1,002,876.725 + 200,575.345 = 1,203,452.07

Then 10028.76725 × 3 = 30,086.30175

Total sum: 1,203,452.07 + 30,086.30175 = 1,233,538.37175

Now divide by 360:

1,233,538.37175 ÷ 360 ≈ ?

Let me perform this division:

Divide numerator and denominator by 10: 123,353.837175 ÷ 36

Let me compute how many times 36 fits into 123,353.837175.

Well, 36 × 3,400 = 122,400

Subtract that from 123,353.837175: 123,353.837175 - 122,400 = 953.837175

Now, 36 × 26 = 936

Subtract 936 from 953.837175: 17.837175 left.

So total is 3,400 + 26 = 3,426, plus 17.837175 / 36 ≈ 0.495...

So total ≈ 3,426.495...

So the area is approximately 3,426.495 m². Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 3,426.50 m². Wait, but let me check if there are more decimal digits. Since the next digit is 5, so 3,426.495 rounds to 3,426.50 when rounded to two decimal places. 

But let me check if there were any rounding errors during the process. For example, when I computed π × r², I used an approximate value of π. Let me see if using more precise π would change the result significantly. Let me try with more decimal places for π.

Let me use π ≈ 3.141592653589793.

Compute π × 3192.25:

π × 3192.25 = ?

Well, 3192.25 × π. Let me compute this precisely.

Let me compute 3192.25 × π:

First, note that 3192.25 × π ≈ 3192.25 × 3.141592653589793.

Using a calculator-like approach, but since I don't have one, I'll rely on previous steps. Earlier, with π ≈ 3.14159265, I got π × r² ≈ 10028.76725. Let me assume that's accurate enough. 

Then multiplying by 123/360 gives us approximately 3,426.495 m². So with more precise calculation, it's around 3,426.50 m². 

But let me also check using another formula. What if I convert the angle to radians and use the other formula?

Angle in radians: θ_rad = 123° × (π / 180) ≈ 123 × 0.0174532925 ≈ ?

Calculating 123 × π / 180. Let me compute that:

π / 180 ≈ 0.0174532925

Multiply by 123: 123 × 0.0174532925 ≈ ?

Let me compute 120 × 0.0174532925 = 2.0943951

Then 3 × 0.0174532925 ≈ 0.0523598775

Adding them gives ≈ 2.0943951 + 0.0523598775 ≈ 2.1467549775 radians.

Then using the area formula: (1/2) × r² × θ_rad.

So compute (1/2) × (56.5)^2 × 2.1467549775.

We already know that (56.5)^2 = 3192.25. So:

Area = 0.5 × 3192.25 × 2.1467549775.

Compute 0.5 × 3192.25 = 1596.125.

Then multiply by 2.1467549775:

1596.125 × 2.1467549775.

Let me compute this. Breaking it down:

First, 1596.125 × 2 = 3192.25

Then 1596.125 × 0.1467549775.

Let me approximate 0.1467549775 as approximately 0.146755.

So compute 1596.125 × 0.146755.

This is going to be complex without a calculator, but let me attempt:

First, approximate 1596.125 × 0.1 = 159.6125

1596.125 × 0.04 = 63.845

1596.125 × 0.006 = 9.57675

1596.125 × 0.000755 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1596.125 × 0.0007 = 1.1172875

And 1596.125 × 0.000055 ≈ 1596.125 × 0.00005 = 0.07980625 and 1596.125 × 0.000005 = 0.007980625. Total ≈ 0.0798 + 0.00798 ≈ 0.08778.

Adding up all parts:

159.6125 + 63.845 = 223.4575 + 9.57675 = 233.03425 + 1.1172875 ≈ 234.1515 + 0.08778 ≈ 234.23928.

So total area ≈ 3192.25 + 234.23928 ≈ 3426.48928 m².

Which is very close to our prior result of approximately 3,426.495 m². This suggests that the area is approximately 3,426.50 m² when rounded to two decimal places.

But let me check with even more precise calculation. Since using two different methods gave me results around 3,426.495 and 3,426.489, which are almost identical. So the precise value is approximately 3,426.495 m². Rounded to two decimal places, it would be 3,426.50 m².

However, let me check if there's a possible error in calculation. Let me see, maybe I should use calculator-like exactness. For instance, let me use the exact fractional value.

Alternatively, since the problem states that the radius is 56.5 meters, which has one decimal place, but the angle is given as 123 degrees, which is exact. So the area will depend on the precision of π and the operations performed.

But given that both methods give me approximately 3,426.50 m² when rounded to two decimal places. However, to ensure correctness, let me check using exact computation via calculator steps.

Alternatively, I can use the exact formula:

Area = (θ/360) × π × r²

Plug in θ = 123, r = 56.5.

So Area = (123/360) × π × (56.5)^2.

Compute 56.5 squared: 56.5² = 3192.25.

Then multiply by π: 3192.25 × π ≈ 3192.25 × 3.1415926535 ≈ let me compute this with higher precision.

Let me compute 3192.25 × π:

First, note that π ≈ 3.141592653589793.

So:

3192.25 × π = ?

Well, 3192.25 × π ≈ 3192.25 × 3.141592653589793.

Let me compute this as follows:

First, 3000 × π ≈ 9424.77796

Then 192.25 × π ≈ ?

Compute 192 × π ≈ 599.87796

Then 0.25 × π ≈ 0.785398

So total for 192.25 × π ≈ 599.87796 + 0.785398 ≈ 600.663358

Thus total area is 9424.77796 + 600.663358 ≈ 10025.4413 m².

Wait, but previously I had 10028.76725. Wait, why the discrepancy? Because here, I broke down 3192.25 into 3000 + 192.25. Let me check that.

Yes, 3000 + 192.25 = 3192.25. Correct.

But earlier when I did the breakdown with π × 3192.25, I had 10028.76725. But according to this, it's 10025.4413. There's inconsistency here. Which one is correct?

Ah, I realize my mistake. In the second breakdown, I said that 3000 × π ≈ 9424.77796. Let me check that. π × 3000 = 3000 × 3.1415926535 ≈ 9424.77796. Correct.

Then 192.25 × π. Let me check this again. 192 × π is indeed approximately 599.87796? Let me compute π × 192. π × 192 = π × 192 ≈ 3.14159265 × 192.

Let me compute 3 × 192 = 576, 0.14159265 × 192 ≈ ?

Well, 0.1 × 192 = 19.2, 0.04 × 192 = 7.68, 0.00159265 × 192 ≈ 0.305. So total ≈ 19.2 + 7.68 = 26.88 + 0.305 ≈ 27.185. Thus total π × 192 ≈ 576 + 27.185 = 603.185. Not 599.87796. So my previous calculation was wrong here. Hence, the error comes from incorrect estimation of π × 192.25.

Let me redo that. Compute π × 192.25. Let me compute π × 192.25.

First, π × 192 = 603.185 (as above)

Then π × 0.25 = 0.785398...

So total π × 192.25 = 603.185 + 0.785398 ≈ 603.9704.

Hence, total π × 3192.25 = π × 3000 + π × 192.25 ≈ 9424.77796 + 603.9704 ≈ 10028.74836 m². Ah, which matches our previous calculation of approximately 10028.76725. Close enough considering rounding errors. So that confirms that π × r² ≈ 10028.75 m².

Then multiply by 123/360 ≈ 0.341666... gives us 10028.75 × 0.341666... ≈ ?

Let me use the exact value of 123/360 = 41/120. So Area = (41/120) × π × 3192.25.

Let me compute this as follows:

First, compute 41 × 3192.25 = ?

Well, 40 × 3192.25 = 127,690.0

Plus 1 × 3192.25 = 3,192.25
