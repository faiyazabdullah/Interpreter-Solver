QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two parabolas, f and g. The function f is given as y = x², which is a standard upward-opening parabola with vertex at the origin. The other function g is a translated version of f, and we need to find its equation based on the given points.

First, let me recall that translating a parabola involves shifting it horizontally and/or vertically. The general form for a translated parabola is y = a(x - h)² + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. Since f is y = x², which has vertex at (0,0), and g is a translation of f, so its equation should be similar but adjusted based on its vertex.

Looking at the predicates, there's a point B which is the vertex of parabola g. The coordinates of B are given as (-3, -5). Wait, the IsXOf(B,-3) and IsYOf(B,-5) mean that the vertex of g is at (-3, -5). Therefore, substituting h = -3 and k = -5 into the general form, the equation for g would be y = (x - (-3))² + (-5), simplifying to y = (x + 3)² - 5. 

But let me check if there's more to it. The problem mentions that g is a translated version of f(x) = x². Translations don't involve scaling or reflection unless specified, so assuming it's just horizontal and vertical shifts. The vertex form directly gives us the equation once we know the vertex. Since the original f had vertex at (0,0), moving it to (-3, -5) means shifting left 3 units and down 5 units. That transformation would indeed result in replacing x with x + 3 (for the left shift) and subtracting 5 from the entire function (for the downward shift). So yes, the equation becomes y = (x + 3)² - 5.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the direction of the shift. If the vertex is at (-3, -5), then horizontally, since the x-coordinate is -3, that's a shift left by 3 units. In the equation, replacing x with x + 3 would account for that. For example, if you have a function f(x) and you want to shift it left by 3, you replace x with x + 3. Similarly, shifting down by 5 units would mean subtracting 5 from the output, hence adding -5 at the end. So combining these transformations, the equation for g is y = (x + 3)² - 5. That seems correct.

Let me also verify with the given points. The vertex of g is at (-3, -5), so plugging x = -3 into the equation gives y = (-3 + 3)² -5 = 0 -5 = -5, which matches. So that checks out. Also, since f is y = x², which is a parabola opening upwards with vertex at (0,0), and g is a shifted version, so the shape remains the same, just moved. Therefore, the equation for g is correctly determined by the vertex coordinates.

I think that's all. There's no mention of any other transformations like reflections or stretches, so the equation is simply the vertex form with the given vertex coordinates.
