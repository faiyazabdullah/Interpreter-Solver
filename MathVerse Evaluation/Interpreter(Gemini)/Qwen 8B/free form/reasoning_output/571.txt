QUESTION:
There are two quadratic functions. The red one is g(x) that goes through the origin and point (2, -4). Find the equation of the dashed line in red. Use exact numbers.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the equation of the dashed line in red, which is given as function g(x). The problem states that this red line passes through the origin (0,0) and the point (2, -4). 

First, I need to recall how to find the equation of a line when two points are given. The general form of a linear equation is y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept should be zero because when x=0, y=0. That simplifies things because we don't have to worry about the b term here.

So, the first thing I should do is calculate the slope (m) of the line passing through the points (0,0) and (2, -4). The formula for slope between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1). Plugging in the given points, the slope would be (-4 - 0)/(2 - 0) = -4/2 = -2. 

Therefore, the slope m is -2. Since the line passes through the origin, the equation of the line should be y = -2x. Let me double-check that. If x=0, y=0, which matches the origin. And if x=2, then y=-2*2 = -4, which matches the second point (2, -4). That seems correct.

Wait, but the problem mentions that there are two quadratic functions, and the red one is g(x). Wait, hold on. Wait, the user mentioned "two quadratic functions" but then says "the red one is g(x) that goes through the origin..." Hmm, maybe there's confusion here? Because a quadratic function is a parabola, not a straight line. But the problem refers to it as a line. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement?

Wait, looking back at the given predicates: There's Shape(g) and Shape(f), with Red(Shape(g)) and Blue(Shape(f)). Also, PointLiesOnLine(Origin, Line(g)) and PointLiesOnLine(P, Line(g)). So, Line(g) is a line, and Shape(g) is a line. So perhaps the problem has a typo, referring to g as a quadratic function but actually it's a line? Or maybe the problem is mixing terms. Alternatively, maybe the line is called a quadratic function? That doesn't make much sense. Wait, maybe the original problem was about quadratic functions, but the user made a mistake in the description? Or perhaps the red shape is a line, which is a degenerate conic, hence considered a quadratic function? 

But regardless, based on the given predicates, the problem says that the red line (Line(g)) goes through the origin and point (2, -4). Therefore, even though the term "quadratic function" is used, the actual object is a line. Maybe the term "quadratic function" was a misstatement, and they meant a linear function. Otherwise, if it were a quadratic function, we'd need more information, like another point or the vertex, since a quadratic function requires three conditions. However, with just two points, you can't uniquely define a quadratic function unless additional constraints are given. 

Given that the problem asks for the equation of the dashed line in red, which is referred to as g(x), and the given points are on that line, I think the intended interpretation is that g(x) is a linear function, i.e., a straight line, even though the term "quadratic" is used. It's possible that there was a mistranslation or mislabeling in the problem. Given that, proceeding under the assumption that g(x) is a linear function (a straight line) passing through those two points.

Thus, the equation of the line is y = -2x. To present this in standard form, it could also be written as 2x + y = 0, but the problem may prefer slope-intercept form. Since the question says "equation of the dashed line in red," and the line passes through the origin, the simplest form is y = -2x. 

Let me check again if there's anything else. The problem mentions other elements like Shape(f) being blue, but since the question is specifically about the red line (g), those other details might not be relevant here. The rest of the predicates like LengthOf(Origin) equals 0, LengthOf(P) equals 2â€”these are probably confirming the coordinates of Origin as (0,0) and P as (2,-4), which aligns with our earlier calculation. 

No contradictions found so far. Therefore, the equation of the red line is y = -2x.
