QUESTION:
Write an equation for the transformation of f(x)=|x| as shown in the figure, which passes (-2, 1) and are piecewise.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question is about finding the equation of a transformation of the function f(x) = |x|, which passes through the point (-2, 1) and is piecewise. 

The given predicates include points A, B, C, D, E with specific coordinates. Let me parse those first. From the Equals statements:

- A is (-4, 2)
- B is (0, 2)
- C is (-2, 1)

Also, there are lines defined: Line(A,B), Line(C,D), Line(D,E). But since Points D and E aren't directly given, maybe they're part of other structures? Wait, but the problem mentions a figure that shows the transformed function passing through (-2, 1). Since C is at (-2,1), maybe that's the point we need to consider?

But the main goal is to find the equation of the transformed absolute value function. The original function f(x) = |x| has a V-shape with vertex at (0,0). Transformations could involve reflections, shifts, stretches, or compressions. Since it's piecewise, perhaps it's split into two linear pieces, like the standard absolute value function.

Given that the transformed function passes through (-2, 1), which is point C. So maybe the function is shifted horizontally and/or vertically, or reflected. Also, considering the original function's shape, if it's a reflection over the x-axis, y-axis, or some combination.

Let me think about transformations of absolute value functions. The general form is f(x) = a|x - h| + k, where (h, k) is the vertex. However, if the function is piecewise, it might have different expressions for x < h and x ≥ h.

Wait, but the problem says "piecewise," so maybe it's not just a simple vertical or horizontal shift. Alternatively, maybe it's a reflection combined with a shift. Let's see. The original function f(x) = |x|. If we reflect it over the x-axis, we get -|x|, but that would invert the V. However, our transformed function passes through (-2,1). Let's check if that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe there's a horizontal shift. Suppose the function is |x + 2|, which would have its vertex at (-2, 0). Then plugging x=-2 gives y=0, but the point is (-2,1), so that doesn't fit. What if there's a vertical shift? Like |x + 2| + 1? Then at x=-2, y=1, which matches. That seems promising. But wait, that would make the function y = |x + 2| + 1. But let's check another point. For example, when x=0, y = |0 + 2| +1 = 2 +1=3. Is there any info about other points? The given points are A(-4,2), B(0,2), C(-2,1). Maybe these points lie on the transformed graph?

Wait, the line AB connects points A(-4,2) and B(0,2). That's a horizontal line at y=2 from x=-4 to x=0. Similarly, line CD connects C(-2,1) to D... but D isn't specified. However, point D is on line CE, where E is another point. Wait, the line DE is also present. But without knowing D and E's coordinates, maybe we can infer something else.

Alternatively, since the problem refers to a figure showing the transformed function, but since we don't have the figure, we have to rely on the given points. The key point mentioned is (-2,1), which is point C. So the transformed function passes through (-2,1).

Assuming that the transformed function is of the form y = |x + h| + k. Since it passes through (-2,1), substituting x=-2 gives y= |-2 + h| +k = 1. Also, maybe there's another point. For instance, looking at the given points A(-4,2) and B(0,2), which are on the same horizontal line. Are these points on the transformed function?

If the transformed function includes the line segment AB, which is horizontal at y=2 from x=-4 to x=0. So, if the transformed function is made up of two linear pieces, maybe one part is the left side of the V and the right side. But how does that align with the point (-2,1)?

Wait, if the transformed function is a V-shaped graph, then it should have two linear segments meeting at the vertex. Suppose the vertex is at (-2,1), which is point C. Then the function would be y = |x + 2| + 1? Wait, no. Because if the vertex is at (-2,1), then the formula would be y = |x - (-2)| + 1? Wait, no. The standard form is y = |x - h| + k, where (h,k) is the vertex. So if the vertex is at (-2,1), then h = -2 and k = 1. Therefore, the equation would be y = |x - (-2)| + 1 → y = |x + 2| + 1. But then evaluating at x=-2 gives y=1, which matches point C. Let's check if the other points A(-4,2) and B(0,2) lie on this function.

For point A(-4, 2): plug x=-4 into the equation. | -4 + 2 | +1 = | -2 | +1 = 2 +1=3. But the y-coordinate of A is 2. That doesn't match. Hmm, contradiction. So maybe my assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the transformed function isn't a simple vertical shift. Maybe it's a reflection. Let me try again. Suppose the function is y = -|x + 2| + 1. Then at x=-2, y=1. At x=-4, y= -| -4 + 2 | +1 = -2 +1 = -1. Not matching point A's y=2. Doesn't work.

Alternatively, maybe the function is a horizontal shift and a vertical stretch. Let's suppose the function is y = a|x + h| + k. We know that when x=-2, y=1. So 1 = a| -2 + h | + k. But we need more equations. Are there other points on the function?

Looking back, points A(-4,2) and B(0,2) are connected by a horizontal line. If these points are on the transformed function, then both x=-4 and x=0 give y=2. Let's assume that the transformed function passes through these points. So, for x=-4, y=2; for x=0, y=2. And also passes through (-2,1). 

So we have three points: (-4,2), (0,2), (-2,1). Let's use these to find the parameters of the transformed function. Assuming the function is a piecewise linear function composed of two lines meeting at the vertex. Let's consider that the function has a vertex somewhere. Given that the points (-4,2) and (0,2) are on the same horizontal line, which suggests that the function might have a minimum or maximum at (-2,1), which is between x=-4 and x=0. So the vertex is at (-2,1). Thus, the function is symmetric around x=-2. 

In that case, the function would be of the form y = a|x + 2| + 1. Now, plug in x=-4: y = a| -4 + 2 | +1 = a*2 +1 = 2a +1. This equals 2 (since point A is (-4,2)), so 2a +1 = 2 → 2a = 1 → a = 1/2. Then the equation would be y = (1/2)|x + 2| +1. Let's verify with x=0: y=(1/2)|0 +2| +1 = (1/2)(2)+1 = 1 +1 = 2, which matches point B(0,2). Also, at x=-2, y=1. Perfect. So this seems to fit.

Therefore, the transformed function is y = (1/2)|x + 2| +1. However, the question mentions that it's a piecewise function. Let me write it in piecewise form. The absolute value can be expressed as:

y = { (1/2)(x + 2) +1 , when x >= -2;
     (1/2)(-x -2) +1 , when x < -2 }

Simplifying each part:

For x >= -2: (1/2)x +1 +1 = (1/2)x + 2? Wait, no. Wait:

Original expression is (1/2)|x + 2| +1. Breaking down:

When x + 2 >=0 → x >= -2: |x +2|=x +2 → y = (1/2)(x +2) +1 = (1/2)x +1 +1 = (1/2)x +2.

Wait, that's not correct. Let me recalculate:

(1/2)(x +2) +1 = (1/2)x +1 +1? No. Wait, (1/2)(x +2) is (1/2)x + 1. Then adding 1 gives (1/2)x +1 +1 = (1/2)x + 2. Yes. So for x >= -2, the function is y = (1/2)x + 2.

For x < -2, |x +2| = -(x +2) = -x -2. So y = (1/2)(-x -2) +1 = (-1/2)x -1 +1 = (-1/2)x. So the piecewise function is:

y = { (1/2)x + 2, when x >= -2;
      (-1/2)x, when x < -2 }

But wait, let me check with x=-2. Plugging into the first part: (1/2)(-2) +2 = -1 +2 =1, which matches. For x approaching -2 from the left, say x=-3: (-1/2)(-3)= 3/2=1.5. Which is consistent with the slope on the left side. 

Now, checking the points:

At x=-4, which is less than -2: y = (-1/2)(-4) = 2, which matches point A(-4,2). At x=0, which is greater than -2: y=(1/2)(0)+2=2, which matches point B(0,2). And at x=-2, y=1. All points check out. 

Thus, the transformed function is piecewise linear, consisting of two parts: left of x=-2, it's a line with slope -1/2 starting from (-∞, ∞), but adjusted to pass through (-2,1); and to the right, a line with slope 1/2 starting from (-2,1). 

Therefore, the equation is piecewise-defined as follows:

f(x) = 
{
  (-1/2)x,   when x < -2;
  (1/2)x + 2, when x ≥ -2
}

Alternatively, written with the absolute value, it's y = (1/2)|x + 2| + 1, but since the question specifies it's piecewise, expressing it in terms of cases is better.

Hence, the final answer is the piecewise function as above.
