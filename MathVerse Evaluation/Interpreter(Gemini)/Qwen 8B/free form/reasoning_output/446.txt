QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\cos a$.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find cos(a) here. So the problem says there's an angle a in standard position, meaning its vertex is at the origin, right? And the terminal side intersects the circle at point P, which has coordinates (-21/29, 20/29). The circle is centered at the origin with radius 1. 

First, I remember that for any point on the unit circle, the coordinates correspond to (cosθ, sinθ) where θ is the angle formed with the positive x-axis. Since the radius is 1, that simplifies things because the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the point and the axes is 1. 

Wait, so if the point P is (-21/29, 20/29), then the x-coordinate should be cos(a) and the y-coordinate should be sin(a). But the question specifically asks for cos(a). That seems straightforward. Let me check if there's anything else I need to consider.

But maybe I need to verify that the point actually lies on the unit circle. The problem states that the radius is 1, so the distance from the origin to point P should be 1. Let me calculate that distance using the distance formula. The distance squared would be (-21/29)^2 + (20/29)^2. Let me compute that:

(-21/29)^2 is (441)/(841) and (20/29)^2 is 400/(841). Adding them gives (441 + 400)/841 = 841/841 = 1. So the distance is sqrt(1) = 1. Yep, that checks out. So the point is indeed on the unit circle.

Therefore, since the coordinates of P are (cos(a), sin(a)), the x-coordinate is cos(a). Therefore, cos(a) should just be -21/29. Wait, but why is the problem giving all those other predicates? Maybe they're just there to confirm the setup?

Let me make sure there's no trick here. The angle a is in standard position, so the terminal side passes through P. The circle is centered at O, which is the origin. The line Xaxis and Yaxis intersect at O. Point P lies on the circle, so it's on the circumference. The length of OP is the radius, which is 1. All these confirm that P is on the unit circle. 

So the key idea here is that for any point on the unit circle, the cosine of the angle is the x-coordinate. Therefore, cos(a) equals the x-coordinate of P, which is -21/29. There's no need to do any more calculations because the coordinates directly give the cosine and sine values. 

I think that's all there is to it. The problem seems designed to test understanding of the unit circle definition of trigonometric functions. So the answer should just be -21/29.
