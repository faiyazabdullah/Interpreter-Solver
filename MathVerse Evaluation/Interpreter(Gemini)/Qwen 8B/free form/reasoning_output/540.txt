MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the period of this trigonometric function based on the given points. So, the problem says that the graph intersects its midline at (1.25, -2.75) and has a minimum point at (4.75, -6.25). Hmm, okay. 

First, I need to recall some properties of trigonometric functions, specifically sine and cosine waves. The midline is the horizontal line around which the function oscillates. The midline equation is usually y = k, where k is the vertical shift. The minimum point would be the lowest point on the graph, so that's related to the amplitude and the midline. 

Let me think. If the midline is at y = -2.75, then the distance from the midline to the minimum point should be the amplitude. Wait, but the minimum value is -6.25. Let me check that. The midline is at y = -2.75, so the minimum point is lower than that. The difference between the minimum value and the midline is (-6.25) - (-2.75) = -3.5. But since amplitude is a positive quantity, the amplitude should be 3.5. 

But wait, how does this relate to the period? The period of a trigonometric function is determined by the distance between two consecutive maximum or minimum points, or between a maximum and the next minimum. However, here we have one minimum point and the midline intersection. Maybe I need to find another point to determine the period?

Alternatively, maybe the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum point relates to the phase shift and the period. Let me visualize the graph. A standard sine or cosine wave crosses the midline at certain points. For example, if you have a cosine function shifted vertically, it crosses the midline at its peaks and troughs. Wait, no, actually, the midline crossings occur midway between maxima and minima. 

So, suppose the function has a minimum at (4.75, -6.25). The midline is crossed at (1.25, -2.75). Let me see how far apart these points are horizontally. The x-coordinate goes from 1.25 to 4.75. That's a difference of 4.75 - 1.25 = 3.5 units. Now, in a typical sinusoidal function, the distance between a minimum and the nearest midline crossing is a quarter of the period. Because from the minimum to the midline is a quarter of the cycle. Let me confirm that.

If we consider a cosine function that has been transformed. Normally, the cosine function has a maximum at x=0, crosses the midline at x=π/2 (which is a quarter period), reaches a minimum at x=π (half period), crosses the midline again at x=3π/2 (three quarters period), and returns to maximum at x=2π (full period). So, the distance from a minimum to the next midline crossing is a quarter of the period. Wait, but in our case, the midline crossing is before the minimum. Let me think again.

Wait, the midline crossing could be either going up or down. Suppose the function is decreasing through the midline. So starting from a midline crossing, going down to a minimum, then back up. So the time between the midline crossing and the minimum is a quarter period. Therefore, the distance between the midline crossing at x=1.25 and the minimum at x=4.75 is 3.5 units, which would correspond to a quarter period. Hence, the full period would be 4 times that distance. 

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's say the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum is a quarter period. Then, if that distance is 3.5, then the period would be 4*3.5 = 14. Is that correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum is half the period? No, because from midline crossing to minimum is a quarter period. Let me think about the standard cosine function. Starting at x=0, it's at maximum, crosses midline at π/2, reaches minimum at π, crosses midline again at 3π/2, and back to maximum at 2π. So, from maximum to minimum is half the period. From maximum to midline crossing is a quarter period. Similarly, from midline crossing to minimum is another quarter period. So yes, the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum is a quarter of the period.

Therefore, the horizontal distance between the midline crossing at x=1.25 and the minimum at x=4.75 is 4.75 - 1.25 = 3.5. Since that's a quarter period, the total period is 4 * 3.5 = 14. 

But wait, is there any other consideration? Like whether the function is a sine or cosine function? Or if there's a phase shift involved? Well, the problem doesn't specify, but since we're given a minimum point and a midline crossing, the relationship between them should still hold regardless of the type of function (as long as it's a standard sinusoid).

Alternatively, maybe the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum is not a quarter period. Let me verify with equations. 

Suppose the general form of a sinusoidal function is y = A sin(Bx + C) + D or y = A cos(Bx + C) + D. The midline is y = D. The amplitude is |A|. The period is 2π / |B|. 

The minimum occurs when the sine or cosine function reaches its minimum. For a cosine function, the minimum occurs when Bx + C = π, leading to x = (π - C)/B. For a sine function, the minimum occurs when Bx + C = 3π/2, so x = (3π/2 - C)/B. 

In either case, the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum depends on the phase shift. However, without knowing the phase shift, how can we determine the period? Wait, but in this problem, they give us two specific points: one on the midline and one at the minimum. 

Let me think. Let’s assume the function is of the form y = A cos(Bx + C) + D. We know that the midline is y = D, which passes through (1.25, -2.75), so D = -2.75. The minimum point is at (4.75, -6.25). The minimum value of the function is D - A, since the amplitude is |A|, and the minimum is D - A (if it's a cosine function). So, setting D - A = -6.25. Plugging in D = -2.75 gives -2.75 - A = -6.25 => -A = -6.25 + 2.75 = -3.5 => A = 3.5. 

Now, the period is 2π / |B|. How do we find B? Well, the minimum occurs when the argument of the cosine function is π radians. So, Bx + C = π. At the minimum point x = 4.75, so B*(4.75) + C = π. Also, the midline crossing occurs when the argument is π/2 or 3π/2, depending on direction. Since the midline crossing is at x=1.25, let's suppose that at this point, the function crosses the midline moving downward, which would correspond to the argument being π/2 (for a cosine function that starts at maximum, then decreases). Wait, but the midline crossing could be at different phases. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to use the fact that the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum is a quarter period. 

Earlier calculation suggested that the horizontal distance between the midline crossing (x=1.25) and the minimum (x=4.75) is 3.5 units. If that corresponds to a quarter period, then the period T is 4 * 3.5 = 14. 

But let me check with equations. Let's take the general case. Let's suppose that the midline crossing occurs at x = 1.25, and the minimum occurs at x = 4.75. Let's assume that the function is a cosine function, which normally has a maximum at x = 0, then crosses midline at x = π/2, reaches minimum at x = π, etc. So, the distance from the midline crossing to the minimum is a quarter period. 

Thus, the horizontal distance between midline crossing and minimum is T/4. Therefore, T = 4*(4.75 - 1.25) = 4*(3.5) = 14. 

Alternatively, if the function were a sine function, the same logic applies. For example, a sine function reaches its minimum at 3π/2. So, the distance from the midline crossing to the minimum would also be a quarter period. 

Therefore, regardless of whether it's a sine or cosine function, the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum is a quarter period. Thus, the period is 14. 

Wait, but maybe the midline crossing isn't directly between the maximum and minimum? For instance, if the function crosses the midline at a point that's not halfway between a maximum and a minimum. But in reality, the midline crossings happen exactly halfway between a maximum and a minimum. So, the distance between the midline crossing and the minimum is indeed a quarter period. 

Hence, the answer should be 14 units. 

Let me just check once more. Suppose the period is 14. Then, the distance between midline crossing and minimum is 3.5, which is 14 divided by 4, so that's consistent. Therefore, the period is 14. 

I think that's the correct approach. There's no ambiguity here, right? The problem gives two points: one on the midline and one at the minimum. The horizontal distance between them is a quarter of the period. Multiply by four to get the full period. 

Yes, that seems solid. So the final answer is 14.
