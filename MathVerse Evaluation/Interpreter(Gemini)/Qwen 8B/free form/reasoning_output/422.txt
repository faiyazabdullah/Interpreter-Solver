QUESTION:
The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about finding the remaining area when the total area is 6096. Wait, but first I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. Let me go through the given predicates step by step.

First, there are three rectangles mentioned: Rectangle(1), Rectangle(2), and Rectangle(3). Each has certain properties. The predicates include their heights and widths. Also, areas are given for each rectangle. Then there's a statement that says Add(AreaOf(1), AreaOf(2), AreaOf(3)) equals 6096. But wait, the question is asking how much area is remaining. Hmm, maybe there's a larger shape or something else involved where these rectangles are part of, and we need to find the remaining area after subtracting these three?

Wait, let me check the given data again. The problem states that the total area is 6096. How much area is remaining? Maybe the total area refers to something else, like a bigger figure that includes these three rectangles, and we have to find what's left? Or perhaps the problem is implying that the sum of the areas of the three rectangles is part of a total, and the remaining area is the difference?

Let me parse the given predicates more carefully. 

We have:

- Rectangle(1): Height is 6, Width is 1000. Therefore, its area should be width multiplied by height, so 1000*6=6000. And indeed, Equals(AreaOf(1),6000) is given.

- Rectangle(2): Height is 6, Width is 10. So area would be 10*6=60. Which matches Equals(AreaOf(2),60).

- Rectangle(3): Its height is also 6 (since Equals(HeightOf(3),6)). But the width isn't directly given. However, the area of Rectangle(3) is not explicitly stated yet. Wait, but there's a line that says "Add(AreaOf(1),AreaOf(2),AreaOf(3))" equals 6096. Since AreaOf(1)=6000 and AreaOf(2)=60, adding them gives 6060. So adding AreaOf(3) to that gives 6096. Therefore, AreaOf(3) must be 6096 - 6060 = 36. So AreaOf(3) is 36. But how do we get that?

But the problem mentions that the total area is 6096. If the total area refers to the sum of the three rectangles, then the remaining area would be zero? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe there's a larger figure where these three rectangles are part of, and the total area is 6096, so the remaining area is Total minus Sum of the three areas. Wait, but according to the given, the sum of the three areas is already 6096. So if the total area is 6096, then the remaining area would be zero? That seems odd. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the area of Rectangle(3) being missing? Wait, let me re-examine the problem statement. The user wrote: "The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?" Maybe the total area refers to some other context, like a big square or something else, and the three rectangles are parts of it. But the given data does not mention such a larger figure. Wait, but looking at the predicates, there's a line: "Add(AreaOf(1),AreaOf(2),AreaOf(3))". Then another line: "Equals(Add(AreaOf(1),AreaOf(2),AreaOf(3)),6096)". So that means the sum of the three areas is 6096. Therefore, if the total area is 6096, and the question is asking how much area is remaining, perhaps the remaining area is zero? But that seems too straightforward. Maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe the problem is in Chinese or another language, and "remaining area" refers to something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute the area of Rectangle(3), since the others are given. Let me think again. 

Given that AreaOf(1) is 6000, AreaOf(2) is 60, and the total sum of the three is 6096. So 6000 + 60 + AreaOf(3) = 6096. Solving for AreaOf(3), it's 6096 - 6060 = 36. Therefore, AreaOf(3) is 36. But why is the question asking how much area is remaining? Unless there was a prior context where the total area was supposed to be something else, and now we're calculating the remaining part. But based solely on the given information, the sum of the three areas is 6096. So unless there's a missing piece, like a fourth rectangle or a different figure, the remaining area would be zero. 

Wait, maybe the problem is presented differently. Perhaps the initial setup had a larger area, and the three rectangles are subtracted from it, leaving some remaining area. But without knowing the original total area, we can't calculate that. However, the problem says "the total area is 6096," which could imply that the total area of the entire figure is 6096, and the three rectangles are parts of it. If that's the case, then the remaining area would be the total area minus the sum of the three rectangles. But if the total area is 6096 and the sum of the three is also 6096, then the remaining area is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in translation, and "remaining area" refers to the area of Rectangle(3)? Because the problem didn't specify the total area as including all three. Wait, but the problem says "the total area is 6096." So perhaps the total area is the sum of the three rectangles, making the remaining area zero. However, that seems trivial. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem intended that the total area is something else. For example, if there were four rectangles, but only three are given. Wait, noâ€”the given data only mentions three rectangles. 

Wait, maybe there's confusion between the area of Rectangle(3) and the remaining area. Since the problem provides that the sum of the three areas is 6096, but maybe the question is asking for the area of Rectangle(3)? In that case, the answer would be 36. But the wording is unclear. 

Looking back at the problem statement: "The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?" Given that the sum of the three areas is 6096, perhaps the "total area" refers to something else. For instance, if there was a larger shape, say a big rectangle, whose area is 6096, and the three smaller rectangles are inside it, then the remaining area would be the big area minus the sum of the small ones. But since we don't have info about the big shape, this seems impossible. 

Wait, but the problem may have been translated incorrectly, or there's missing context. Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the area of Rectangle(3), which is 36, because the other two areas are given, and the total sum is 6096. So the remaining area (i.e., AreaOf(3)) is 36. But how to confirm?

Let me check again. The problem lists several predicates. Among them:

- Equals(AreaOf(1),6000)

- Equals(AreaOf(2),60)

Then there's:

Add(AreaOf(1),AreaOf(2),AreaOf(3)) equals 6096. So:

AreaOf(1) + AreaOf(2) + AreaOf(3) = 6096

So substituting:

6000 + 60 + AreaOf(3) = 6096 => AreaOf(3) = 6096 - 6060 = 36. 

Therefore, the area of Rectangle(3) is 36. If the question is asking for the remaining area, which in this context could refer to the third rectangle's area, then the answer is 36. However, the phrasing is ambiguous. But given that the total area is 6096, which is the sum of all three, and the question is "how much area is remaining," it's possible that the intended answer is 36. 

Alternatively, if there was a previous total area that wasn't specified, but given the way the problem is set up, I think the correct interpretation is that the sum of the three areas is 6096, and the question is asking for the area of Rectangle(3), which is 36. Hence, the remaining area is 36. 

Another possibility: maybe the problem meant that the total area of the three rectangles is 6096, and the question is asking for the area of one of them. But since two areas are given, the third is 36. 

Thus, the answer should be 36. Therefore, the remaining area is 36.
