QUESTION:
There is a hyperbolic function with its center at the origin. The graph approaches zero as $∣x∣$ increases, and the function is undefined at x=0. There are four points labeled at (1/6,6), (6,1/6), (-1/6,-6), (-6,-1/6). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The question mentions a hyperbola with its center at the origin. The graph approaches zero as |x| increases, and it's undefined at x=0. Then there are four points given: (1/6,6), (6,1/6), (-1/6,-6), (-6,-1/6). The task is to find the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

Hmm, hyperbola centered at the origin... Hyperbolas usually have equations like xy = k or something similar. Wait, but if it's a rectangular hyperbola, maybe? Because the asymptotes would be the axes. Also, since it's undefined at x=0, that suggests the function isn't defined where x=0, which aligns with hyperbola equations because they have denominators that become zero at certain points. But the problem says the graph approaches zero as |x| increases. Let me think about that.

Wait, if the hyperbola has asymptotes approaching the axes, then as x approaches infinity, y approaches zero. That matches the description. So the equation could be something like y = k/x, which is a hyperbola. Let me check the given points. 

Looking at the points: (1/6, 6) and (6, 1/6). If we plug x=1/6 into y=k/x, then y would be k/(1/6) = 6k. We know y is 6, so 6k=6 → k=1. Similarly, plugging x=6 gives y=1/6, which also fits with k=1. Similarly, the other two points (-1/6, -6) and (-6, -1/6) would fit if k=1. So the equation seems to be y = 1/x. 

But wait, the standard form for such a hyperbola is xy = c. In this case, c would be 1. So the hyperbola equation is xy = 1. However, the problem states that the function is undefined at x=0, which is true because division by zero is undefined. And as |x| increases, y approaches zero, which matches the behavior. 

Now, the domain and range of the function y = 1/x. The domain is all real numbers except x=0, so in interval notation, that's (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞). Similarly, the range is all real numbers except y=0, so same intervals. But wait, the problem says "the graph approaches zero as |x| increases", which is correct for y=1/x, since as x approaches positive or negative infinity, y approaches zero. 

But let me confirm if there's another possibility. Could it be a different hyperbola? For example, maybe a horizontal or vertical hyperbola. But the given points seem to suggest that it's a rectangular hyperbola rotated by 45 degrees. Wait, the standard rectangular hyperbola is indeed xy = c, which is a hyperbola rotated so that its asymptotes are the coordinate axes. So yes, the equation should be xy = 1. 

So the domain is all real numbers except x=0, and the range is all real numbers except y=0. Therefore, written in interval notation, domain is (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞) and range is the same. 

But wait, the problem mentions that the function is undefined at x=0. Which is already covered here. Also, the graph approaches zero as |x| increases. Correct. 

Therefore, the domain and range are both (-∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞). So the answer should state that.
