QUESTION:
Find the height h mm of this closed cylinder if its surface area (S) is $27288$mm2 and the radius (r) of its circular faces is 43mm.

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the height h of a closed cylinder given its surface area S is 27288 mm² and the radius r is 43 mm. Alright, first, I should recall the formula for the surface area of a closed cylinder. 

Wait, a closed cylinder has two circular bases and the lateral surface area. The formula for the total surface area should be the sum of the areas of the two circles plus the lateral surface area. Let me confirm that. The area of each base is πr², so two bases would be 2πr². Then the lateral surface area is the circumference of the base times the height, which is 2πr*h. So combining those, the total surface area S = 2πr² + 2πrh. 

But wait, the problem mentions it's a closed cylinder, so yes, that includes both bases. Now, they gave us S = 27288 mm² and r = 43 mm. We need to find h. 

So plugging the known values into the equation. Let me write that out:

S = 2πr² + 2πrh

We can substitute S = 27288, r = 43. Let me compute each part step by step. First, calculate 2πr². Let me compute r squared first. 43 squared is... 43*43. Let me do that calculation. 40² is 1600, 3² is 9, and cross terms 2*40*3=240. So (a+b)² = a² + 2ab + b². Wait, but actually, 43*43 is 1849. Let me check that again. 40*40=1600, 40*3=120, 3*40=120, 3*3=9. So total is 1600 + 120 + 120 +9 = 1600 + 240 +9 = 1849. Yes, correct. So r² = 1849. Then multiply by 2π: 2π*1849. Let me compute that. But maybe I should keep it symbolic for now. 

Then, the other term is 2πr*h. Which would be 2π*43*h. So putting it all together:

27288 = 2π*(43²) + 2π*43*h

Alternatively, factor out 2π*43:

Wait, no. Let me rearrange the equation. Let me subtract 2πr² from both sides:

27288 - 2πr² = 2πr*h

Then divide both sides by 2πr to get h:

h = [27288 - 2πr²]/(2πr)

Alternatively, h = [S - 2πr²]/(2πr). That seems manageable.

Let me compute the numbers step by step. First, compute 2πr². Since r is 43, r² is 1849. Multiply by 2π: 2π*1849. Let me compute that numerically. Let's take π ≈ 3.1416. 

First, 2*1849 = 3698. Then multiply by π: 3698 * π. Let me calculate that. Let me approximate π as 3.1416. So 3698 * 3.1416. Hmm. Let me break it down:

Well, 3698 * 3 = 11094, 3698 * 0.1416. Let me compute 3698 * 0.1 = 369.8, 3698 * 0.04 = 147.92, 3698 * 0.0016 = approx 5.9168. Adding these up: 369.8 + 147.92 = 517.72 + 5.9168 ≈ 523.6368. So total is 11094 + 523.6368 ≈ 11617.6368. So approximately 11617.64 mm². 

Wait, but let me check if that's accurate. Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise methods. However, since I'm doing manual calculations, there could be some error here. Alternatively, maybe I can carry out exact expressions before plugging in numbers. Let me think.

Alternatively, let me note that the problem gives some predicates. Looking back at the initial problem statement, there were several predicates listed. Let me parse them again. 

The user mentioned that there are certain predicates, such as:

Circle(A), RadiusOf(Line(O,B), Circle(A)), LengthOf(Line(O,B)) equals 43, HeightOf(A), AreaOf(A) equals 27288, etc. Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to a cylinder where A is the circle? Maybe A is the circle, O and B are points defining the radius line, and the height is another parameter. But regardless, the main thing is that we have the surface area S = 27288 and radius r = 43 mm, and need to find h. 

But going back to my previous calculation, let me re-express the formula properly. Let me write:

Total Surface Area S = 2πr² + 2πrh.

Given S = 27288, r = 43. Solve for h.

Therefore,

h = (S - 2πr²)/(2πr)

Plugging in the numbers:

Compute numerator: 27288 - 2π*(43)^2

Denominator: 2π*43

So let me compute numerator first. Let me compute 2π*(43)^2:

As before, 43² = 1849, so 2π*1849 = 3698π. Therefore, numerator is 27288 - 3698π.

Then denominator is 2π*43 = 86π.

Thus, h = (27288 - 3698π)/86π.

Hmm, maybe simplify this expression. Let me see:

Divide numerator and denominator by π? Not sure. Alternatively, split the fraction:

h = 27288/(86π) - 3698π/(86π) = 27288/(86π) - 3698/86.

Simplify further:

Calculate 3698 / 86. Let me compute that division. 86 * 43 = 3698. Because 86 * 40 = 3440, 86 * 3 = 258, so 3440 + 258 = 3698. Exactly! So 3698 divided by 86 is 43. Therefore, the second term simplifies to 43.

So h = 27288/(86π) - 43.

Now compute 27288 divided by 86. Let me perform that division. 

Divide 27288 by 86. Let me see how many times 86 goes into 27288. Let me compute 86 × 300 = 25800. Subtract 25800 from 27288: 27288 - 25800 = 1488. Now, 86 × 17 = 1462. Because 86×10=860, 86×7=602 → 860+602=1462. Then 1488 - 1462 = 26. So total is 300 + 17 = 317, with remainder 26. So 27288 ÷ 86 = 317 + 26/86 ≈ 317.3023...

But let me check that. Let me verify 86 × 317:

First, 86 × 300 = 25800

86 × 17 = 1462, so total is 25800 + 1462 = 27262. Then 27288 - 27262 = 26. So yes, 27288 = 86 × 317 + 26. Therefore, 27288 / 86 = 317 + 26/86. Simplify 26/86: divide numerator and denominator by 2: 13/43 ≈ 0.3023. So approximately 317.3023.

Therefore, h ≈ 317.3023 / π - 43.

Now compute 317.3023 divided by π. Taking π ≈ 3.1416.

So 317.3023 / 3.1416 ≈ ?

Let me calculate that. Let me approximate:

First, 3.1416 × 100 = 314.16

So 317.3023 - 314.16 = 3.1423. So that means 317.3023 ≈ 3.1416 × 100 + 3.1423. Therefore, dividing by π (which is 3.1416), this becomes approximately 100 + 3.1423 / 3.1416 ≈ 100 + 1.0002 ≈ 101.0002. Therefore, h ≈ 101.0002 - 43 = 58.0002 mm.

Wait, that suggests h ≈ 58 mm. Let me check the calculation again because that seems straightforward. Let me verify:

If h = (27288 / 86π ) - 43 ≈ (approx 317.3023 / π ) - 43 ≈ 101.0002 - 43 = 58.0002. So approximately 58 mm. But let me make sure that the earlier steps are correct.

Wait, let me go back. The numerator was 27288 - 3698π. Then divided by 86π. So h = [27288/(86π)] - [3698π/(86π)] = 27288/(86π) - 3698/86. And since 3698/86 = 43, as we saw, then yes. Then 27288 divided by 86 is 317.3023..., then divided by π. 

But why did we get approximately 101? Let me recalculate 317.3023 divided by π. If π is about 3.1416, then 317.3023 / 3.1416. Let me compute 3.1416 × 100 = 314.16, so 317.3023 - 314.16 = 3.1423. Then 3.1423 / 3.1416 ≈ 1.0002. So total is 100 + 1.0002 = 101.0002. Thus, h ≈ 101.0002 - 43 = 58.0002. So approximately 58 mm. 

But let me check if there's a mistake here. Let me try another way. Suppose I compute the entire expression numerically without breaking it down. Let me compute h = (27288 - 2π*(43)^2) / (2π*43).

First compute 2π*(43)^2: 2π*1849 ≈ 2 * 3.1416 * 1849 ≈ 6.2832 * 1849. Let me compute 6 * 1849 = 11094, 0.2832 * 1849. Let me approximate:

0.2 * 1849 = 369.8

0.08 * 1849 = 147.92

0.0032 * 1849 ≈ 5.9168

Adding those: 369.8 + 147.92 = 517.72 + 5.9168 ≈ 523.6368

So total 2πr² ≈ 11094 + 523.6368 ≈ 11617.6368 mm²

Then subtract that from 27288: 27288 - 11617.6368 ≈ 15670.3632

Then divide by 2πr, which is 2π*43 ≈ 6.2832 * 43 ≈ let's compute 6 * 43 = 258, 0.2832 * 43 ≈ 12.1776. Total ≈ 258 + 12.1776 ≈ 270.1776

So h ≈ 15670.3632 / 270.1776 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division. Let me approximate 15670.36 / 270.1776. Let me see how many times 270 fits into 15670. 

Well, 270 * 50 = 13500. 15670 - 13500 = 2170. Then 270 * 8 = 2160. So total is 50 + 8 = 58, with a remainder of 10. So approximately 58.037 mm. So that aligns with our prior result. Therefore, h ≈ 58 mm. 

But the problem says to round to the nearest whole number. So if the exact value is approximately 58.0002, then rounding to the nearest whole number is 58. 

But let me check once more with more precise calculations. Let me use calculator-like steps. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an exact fractional approach. Let me consider that 27288 is given as the surface area. Let me check if there's a possibility that the surface area was computed with π as 22/7 or something else, but likely not. Since the problem didn't specify, we assume standard π. 

Another way: let me compute h precisely. Let me compute 27288 - 2π*(43)^2 divided by 2π*43.

Let me compute 2π*(43)^2 = 2π*1849 = 3698π. So:

Numerator: 27288 - 3698π

Denominator: 2π*43 = 86π

Thus, h = (27288 - 3698π)/86π = 27288/(86π) - 3698π/(86π) = 27288/(86π) - 43. As before. 

Now, compute 27288 / 86 first. Let me do that division accurately. 86 × 317 = 86 × 300 + 86 × 17 = 25800 + 1462 = 27262. Then 27288 - 27262 = 26. So 27288 / 86 = 317 + 26/86 = 317 + 13/43 ≈ 317.302325581...

So h = (317.302325581...) / π - 43. 

Now, π ≈ 3.1415926536. 

So let me compute 317.302325581 / 3.1415926536. Let me do that division. 

Using a calculator method: Let me estimate 3.1416 × 101 = 3.1416 × 100 + 3.1416 × 1 = 314.16 + 3.1416 = 317.3016. 

Wow, that's very close to the numerator 317.302325581. So 3.1416 × 101 = 317.3016. The difference between the numerator and this product is 317.302325581 - 317.3016 = 0.000725581. 

So to find the exact value, h ≈ 101 + (0.000725581)/3.1416 ≈ 101 + 0.0002309 ≈ 101.0002309. Therefore, h ≈ 101.0002309 - 43 = 58.0002309 mm. 

So h ≈ 58.0002 mm. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 58 mm. 

Therefore, the height is approximately 58 mm. 

Let me just double-check if I made any miscalculations. For example, verifying that the surface area formula is correct. For a closed cylinder, yes, the surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh. So that's correct. 

Also, substituting the numbers correctly. Given that the radius is 43, so r = 43. Plugging into the formula, everything looks good. 

Another sanity check: if the radius is 43 mm, then the area of one base is π*(43)^2 ≈ 3.1416 * 1849 ≈ 5808.6 mm². Two bases would be about 11617.2 mm². Then the total surface area is 27288 mm². So the remaining surface area is 27288 - 11617.2 ≈ 15670.8 mm², which should be the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area is 2πr*h = 2π*43*h ≈ 270.1776 * h. Setting that equal to 15670.8 gives h ≈ 15670.8 / 270.1776 ≈ 58.0 mm. Yep, same result. 

Therefore, confident that the answer is 58 mm.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To find the height $ h $ of a closed cylinder with surface area $ S = 27288 \, \text{mm}^2 $ and radius $ r = 43 \, \text{mm} $, we start by recalling the formula for the total surface area of a closed cylinder:

$$
S = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
$$

---

### Step 1: Rearrange the Formula

We isolate $ h $ by subtracting the area of the two circular bases from the total surface area and then dividing by the lateral surface area contribution:

$$
h = \frac{S - 2\pi r^2}{2\pi r}
$$

Substitute the known values $ S = 27288 $ and $ r = 43 $:

$$
h = \frac{27288 - 2\pi(43)^2}{2\pi(43)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Compute the Numerator and Denominator

#### Compute $ r^2 $:

$$
r^2 = 43^2 = 1849
$$

#### Compute $ 2\pi r^2 $:

$$
2\pi r^2 = 2\pi \cdot 1849 = 3698\pi
$$

#### Compute the full numerator:

$$
\text{Numerator} = 27288 - 3698\pi
$$

#### Compute the denominator:

$$
2\pi r = 2\pi \cdot 43 = 86\pi
$$

So the expression becomes:

$$
h = \frac{27288 - 3698\pi}{86\pi}
$$

Split the fraction:

$$
h = \frac{27288}{86\pi} - \frac{3698\pi}{86\pi}
$$

Since $ \frac{3698\pi}{86\pi} = \frac{3698}{86} = 43 $, the expression reduces to:

$$
h = \frac{27288}{86\pi} - 43
$$

---

### Step 3: Evaluate the Expression

First, compute $ \frac{27288}{86} $:

$$
\frac{27288}{86} = 317.3023...
$$

Then divide by $ \pi \approx 3.1416 $:

$$
\frac{317.3023}{\pi} \approx \frac{317.3023}{3.1416} \approx 101.0002
$$

Finally, subtract 43:

$$
h \approx 101.0002 - 43 = 58.0002
$$

---

### Final Result

Rounded to the nearest whole number:

$$
\boxed{58}
$$

---

Final Answer: $ \boxed{58} $
