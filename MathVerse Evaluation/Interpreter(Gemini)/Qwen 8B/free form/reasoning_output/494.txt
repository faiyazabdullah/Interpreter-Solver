QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function combind by straight lines, which goes through (-3, -2), (0, 1), and (-1, 0). Write an equation for the graphed function f.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding an equation for a piecewise function composed of straight lines that passes through the points (-3, -2), (0, 1), and (-1, 0). Hmm, first I need to figure out how these points connect. Since it's a piecewise function made up of straight lines, there might be different segments connecting these points. 

Wait, but the problem mentions three points: (-3, -2), (0, 1), and (-1, 0). Let me plot them mentally. The point (-3, -2) is on the left lower part, (0, 1) is on the y-axis at height 1, and (-1, 0) is to the left of the origin on the x-axis. Now, since it's a piecewise function combining straight lines, maybe these points are connected in some order? But how?

First, I should check if these points lie on the same line. If they do, then the function would just be a linear equation. But if not, then we have multiple segments. Let me test that. 

Let me calculate the slope between (-3, -2) and (0, 1). The slope m would be (1 - (-2))/(0 - (-3)) = 3/3 = 1. Then, the equation of the line would be y - 1 = 1*(x - 0), so y = x + 1. Now, does (-1, 0) lie on this line? Plugging x=-1: y = -1 + 1 = 0. Yes! Wait, that works. So all three points lie on the same line y = x + 1. That means the entire function is just a single straight line passing through those three points. Therefore, the piecewise function is actually just one linear function. 

But wait, the problem says "piecewise function combined by straight lines", which could imply more than one segment, but if all points lie on the same line, then it's just a single line. Maybe the problem is trying to trick us here? Or perhaps there's something else. Let me double-check my calculation. 

Calculating slope between (-3, -2) and (-1, 0): (0 - (-2))/(-1 - (-3)) = 2/(2) = 1. So same slope. Then the equation between (-3, -2) and (-1, 0) is y - (-2) = 1*(x - (-3)), so y + 2 = x + 3 → y = x +1. And again, plugging in x=0 gives y=1, which matches the third point. So yes, all three points are colinear. Hence, the function is simply y = x + 1. 

But why mention it's a piecewise function? Maybe because the original problem had more points, but in this case, only three points are given. However, the user might have intended that the function has multiple segments, but given the three points lie on a straight line, the equation is straightforward. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was meant to include more points, but due to the way the question is phrased, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But according to the given points, the answer should be y = x + 1. 

Wait, let me confirm once more. Let me plug each point into y = x +1:

For (-3, -2): -3 +1 = -2 → correct.

For (0,1): 0 +1 =1 → correct.

For (-1,0): -1 +1 =0 → correct. All satisfy. So the function is indeed a straight line. Therefore, even though the term "piecewise" is used, in this case, it's a single line. So the equation is y = x +1.

Therefore, the answer should be f(x) = x +1.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
Final Answer: $f(x) = x + 1$

====================================================================================================
EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $f(x) = x + 1$
