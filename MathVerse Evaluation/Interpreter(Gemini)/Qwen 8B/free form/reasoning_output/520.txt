QUESTION:
Esteban's account balance can be modeled by $f(t)=1000 \cdot e^{(0.08 t)}$ and Anna's account balance can be modeled by $g(t)=750 \cdot e^{(0.12 t)}$, where $t$ is the number of years since they opened their accounts. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,1000), (5,1500), and $g(x)$ in red goes through (6,1500), (8,2000). When do the accounts have the same balance?
Round your answer to the nearest integer.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out when Esteban and Anna's accounts have the same balance. So the problem says their balances are modeled by f(t) = 1000e^(0.08t) and g(t) = 750e^(0.12t). We need to find the time t when these two functions are equal. 

First, I should set the two equations equal to each other because we want to find t where f(t) = g(t). That gives me 1000e^(0.08t) = 750e^(0.12t). Hmm, okay. Now I need to solve for t here. Let me think about how to handle exponential equations like this. 

Maybe I can divide both sides by e^(0.08t) to simplify? Let me try that. Dividing both sides by e^(0.08t) would give me 1000 = 750e^(0.12t - 0.08t). Wait, because e^(a) / e^(b) is e^(a-b). So subtracting exponents, that becomes 0.12t - 0.08t = 0.04t. So then the equation simplifies to 1000 = 750e^(0.04t). 

Now, I need to isolate t. Let me divide both sides by 750 first. That gives me 1000/750 = e^(0.04t). Simplifying 1000 divided by 750... Well, 1000 ÷ 750 is the same as 4/3 after dividing numerator and denominator by 250. So 4/3 equals e^(0.04t). 

To get rid of the exponential, take the natural logarithm of both sides. ln(4/3) = ln(e^(0.04t)). Then, the right side simplifies to 0.04t. Therefore, t = ln(4/3)/0.04. 

Let me compute that. First, calculate ln(4/3). I know that ln(4) is approximately 1.386 and ln(3) is about 1.0986, so ln(4/3) ≈ 1.386 - 1.0986 = 0.2874. But maybe I should use more accurate values. Alternatively, I can recall that ln(4/3) is approximately 0.28768207. 

Then divide that by 0.04. So 0.28768207 / 0.04. Let me compute that division. Dividing by 0.04 is the same as multiplying by 25, so 0.28768207 * 25. Let me do that multiplication. 0.28768207 * 25. Breaking it down: 0.25*25=6.25 and 0.03768207*25. Let me compute 0.03768207 * 25. That's 0.03768207 * 20 = 0.7536414 and 0.03768207 * 5 = 0.18841035. Adding them together: 0.7536414 + 0.18841035 ≈ 0.94205175. So total t ≈ 6.25 + 0.94205175 ≈ 7.19205175. 

So approximately 7.19 years. The problem says to round to the nearest integer. So 7.19 rounds to 7. But wait, let me check my calculation again because sometimes approximations can lead to errors. 

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach. Let me verify ln(4/3). Using a calculator, ln(4/3) is indeed approximately 0.28768207. Then dividing by 0.04 gives 0.28768207 / 0.04 = 7.19205175. Yes, so approximately 7.19 years. Rounded to the nearest integer is 7. However, I need to make sure that there isn't some mistake in setting up the equation. 

Wait, but the problem also mentions points that the functions go through. For example, f(x) goes through (0,1000), which makes sense because at t=0, f(0)=1000e^0=1000. Also, (5,1500): plugging t=5 into f(t): 1000e^(0.08*5)=1000e^0.4. Let me check if e^0.4 is roughly 1.4918, so 1000*1.4918≈1491.8, which is close to 1500. Maybe they rounded it. Similarly, for g(x) going through (6,1500): plug t=6 into g(t)=750e^(0.12*6)=750e^0.72. e^0.72 is approximately e^0.7 is about 2.0138, e^0.72 is higher. Let me compute 0.72*ln(e)=0.72, so e^0.72 ≈ 2.054. So 750*2.054≈1540.5, which is near 1500. Again, maybe rounding. But perhaps those points are just examples, not exact. 

But regardless, the main thing is solving the equation f(t)=g(t). So according to our calculation, t≈7.19, which rounds to 7. But wait, let me confirm once more. If I plug t=7 into f(t) and g(t):

For f(7): 1000*e^(0.08*7)=1000*e^0.56. e^0.56 is approximately e^0.5=1.6487, e^0.56 is about 1.750 (since 0.56 is 0.5 + 0.06, so multiply by e^0.06≈1.0618, so 1.6487*1.0618≈1.75). So 1000*1.75=1750.

For g(7): 750*e^(0.12*7)=750*e^0.84. e^0.84 is approximately e^0.8=2.2255, e^0.84 is a bit higher. Let me compute e^0.84. Since ln(2.3) is about 0.8329, so e^0.84 ≈ 2.31. So 750*2.31≈1732.5. So at t=7, f(t)≈1750, g(t)≈1732.5. So they aren't equal yet. At t=7.19, they should cross. Let me check t=7.2:

Compute f(7.2): 0.08*7.2=0.576. e^0.576 ≈ ?

Well, e^0.5=1.6487, e^0.576 = e^(0.5 + 0.076) = e^0.5 * e^0.076. e^0.076 ≈ 1.079. So 1.6487*1.079 ≈ 1.6487*1.08 ≈ 1.779. So f(7.2) ≈ 1000*1.779≈1779.

g(7.2): 0.12*7.2=0.864. e^0.864. Since e^0.864 is e^(approx 0.86) which is around e^0.86. Let me recall that ln(2.36) ≈ 0.858, so e^0.864 is slightly higher than 2.36. Let me say approximately 2.37. Then 750*2.37≈750*2 + 750*0.37 = 1500 + 277.5 = 1777.5. So f(7.2)≈1779 vs g(7.2)≈1777.5. Close. So the actual crossing point is around 7.2, which is approximately 7.19. So rounding to nearest integer would be 7. But wait, if the exact value is ~7.19, then the nearest integer is 7. However, maybe there's a mistake in the setup?

Wait, let me re-express the original equation again. Starting over:

Set 1000e^{0.08t} = 750e^{0.12t}

Divide both sides by 750e^{0.08t}:

(1000/750) = e^{0.12t - 0.08t} => 4/3 = e^{0.04t}

Take natural log:

ln(4/3) = 0.04t => t = ln(4/3)/0.04 ≈ 0.287682 / 0.04 ≈ 7.192...

Yes, so approximately 7.19 years. So the answer is 7 when rounded to the nearest integer. However, wait, maybe the problem expects us to consider the given points? Like, maybe there's another intersection point? Or perhaps the initial assumption that the functions intersect once is correct?

Since both functions are exponential growth, with different rates. The function f(t) has a slower growth rate (0.08) compared to g(t)'s 0.12. Initially, at t=0, f(0)=1000, g(0)=750. So f starts higher. As t increases, g grows faster. So there must be exactly one point where they cross. Hence, the solution is unique. So the answer is approximately 7.19, which rounds to 7. 

But wait, let me check with t=7. Let me compute the exact value of f(7) and g(7):

f(7) = 1000 * e^(0.08*7) = 1000 * e^0.56 ≈ 1000 * 1.7506 ≈ 1750.6

g(7) = 750 * e^(0.12*7) = 750 * e^0.84 ≈ 750 * 2.316 ≈ 750 * 2.316 ≈ 1737

So f(7) is higher than g(7). At t=7.19, they are equal. So when you round 7.19 to the nearest integer, it's 7. But wait, is 7.19 closer to 7 or 8? It's 0.19 away from 7, and 0.81 away from 8. So yes, it's 7. But wait, maybe the precise calculation shows that it's actually a little higher? Let me check with more accurate numbers.

Let me calculate t = ln(4/3)/0.04. Let me compute ln(4/3) more accurately. Using a calculator, ln(4/3) ≈ 0.28768207245178085...

Divided by 0.04: 0.28768207245178085 / 0.04 = 7.192051811294521...

So approximately 7.192 years. Which is 7.192, so 7.19 when rounded to two decimal places. So when rounded to the nearest integer, it's 7. But wait, maybe the problem expects the answer to be 7. But let me check if there's a miscalculation. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the given points (like (5,1500) and (6,1500)) to imply something else? Wait, no, those are just sample points. The functions are continuous exponentials. So the exact solution is t ≈ 7.19, so 7 when rounded. But wait, maybe the answer is 7. But I need to check if there's an error in the setup. Let me check the algebra again.

Original equation: 1000e^{0.08t} = 750e^{0.12t}

Divide both sides by e^{0.08t}: 1000 = 750e^{0.04t}

Divide both sides by 750: 1000/750 = e^{0.04t}

Which is 4/3 = e^{0.04t}

Taking ln: ln(4/3) = 0.04t → t = ln(4/3)/0.04 ≈ 0.287682 / 0.04 ≈ 7.19. Correct.

Therefore, the answer is approximately 7.19, which rounds to 7. However, sometimes in such problems, depending on the exact calculation, maybe it's 7.19 which is closer to 7. But let me check with t=7.19:

Calculate f(7.19) and g(7.19).

First, compute 0.08*7.19 = 0.5752. e^0.5752. Let me compute that:

We know that e^0.5752 ≈ e^0.5 * e^0.0752. e^0.5 is about 1.6487. e^0.0752 ≈ 1 + 0.0752 + 0.0752²/2 ≈ 1 + 0.0752 + 0.00283 ≈ 1.0780. So total is 1.6487 * 1.078 ≈ 1.6487*1.078 ≈ Let me compute 1.6487*1 = 1.6487, 1.6487*0.07 = 0.1154, 1.6487*0.008 = 0.0132. Total ≈ 1.6487 + 0.1154 + 0.0132 ≈ 1.7773. Multiply by 1000: 1777.3.

For g(7.19): 0.12*7.19 = 0.8628. Compute e^0.8628. Let me note that e^0.8628. Let me recall that ln(2.37) ≈ 0.862. Because ln(2) is 0.693, ln(2.3) is about 0.8329, ln(2.37) is higher. Let me check: e^0.8628. Suppose we use Taylor series or better approximation. Alternatively, since ln(2.37) ≈ 0.862, then e^0.8628 ≈ 2.37 * e^(0.0028). e^0.0028 ≈ 1 + 0.0028 + ... ≈ 1.0028. So 2.37 * 1.0028 ≈ 2.37 + 2.37*0.0028 ≈ 2.37 + 0.0066 ≈ 2.3766. So g(7.19) = 750 * 2.3766 ≈ 750 * 2.3766 ≈ Let me compute 700*2.3766 = 1663.62, 50*2.3766 = 118.83, total ≈ 1663.62 + 118.83 ≈ 1782.45. Wait, but earlier estimate for f was 1777.3. There seems to be inconsistency here. This suggests that maybe my estimation for e^0.8628 is off. Let me check with a better method.

Alternatively, using a calculator-like computation, but since I don't have a calculator here, perhaps I can use known values. Let me think. For instance, e^0.8628:

We know that e^0.8 = 2.2255, e^0.86 = e^0.8 * e^0.06 ≈ 2.2255 * 1.0618 ≈ 2.2255*1.06 ≈ 2.358. Then e^0.8628 is e^(0.86 + 0.0028) = e^0.86 * e^0.0028 ≈ 2.358 * 1.0028 ≈ 2.358 + 2.358*0.0028 ≈ 2.358 + 0.0066 ≈ 2.3646. Thus, g(7.19) = 750 * 2.3646 ≈ 750 * 2.3646. Let me compute that: 700*2.3646 = 1655.22, 50*2.3646 = 118.23. Total ≈ 1655.22 + 118.23 ≈ 1773.45. Whereas f(7.19) was approximated as 1777.3. So there's still a small discrepancy, likely due to estimation errors in manual calculations. However, the exact value of t is around 7.19, and since the difference between f(t) and g(t) at t=7.19 is minimal, the exact solution is indeed approximately 7.19. 

Thus, the answer is 7 when rounded to the nearest integer. But let me check if there's any chance that due to the way the problem is presented, maybe the intended answer is different. For example, if during the calculation, someone made a mistake in the algebra. But the steps seem correct. Another way to check is to see if the answer matches the given points. For example, the problem states that f(x) passes through (5,1500). Let me check f(5) = 1000e^(0.08*5) = 1000e^0.4 ≈ 1000*1.4918 ≈ 1491.8, which is close to 1500. Similarly, g(6) = 750e^(0.12*6) = 750e^0.72 ≈ 750*2.054 ≈ 1540.5, which is close to 1500. These are probably rounded values in the problem statement, so they don't affect the exact solution.

Therefore, the correct answer is approximately 7.19, which rounds to 7. So the final answer is 7.
