QUESTION:
Consider the two similar spheres shown. The smaller sphere has radius $3$ cm while the larger sphere has a radius of 12 cm.


Find the volume of Sphere A, in simplest exact form.

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have two similar spheres, Sphere A and Sphere B. The problem states that the smaller sphere (A) has a radius of 3 cm, and the larger one (B) has a radius of 12 cm. We need to find the volume of Sphere A.

First, I should recall the formula for the volume of a sphere. The volume V of a sphere is given by (4/3)πr³, where r is the radius. Since we're dealing with similar spheres, maybe there's something about similarity ratios that applies here? Wait, but the question specifically asks for the volume of Sphere A, which already gives us the radius directly. Hmm, maybe the similarity is just extra info?

Wait, let me check again. The problem mentions they are similar, so maybe there's a way that similarity affects the volume? But since we already know the radius of Sphere A, perhaps the similarity ratio isn't necessary here. Let me think. If they were similar, the ratio of their radii would be the same as the ratio of their linear dimensions. But since we already have the radius of A as 3 cm, maybe we don't need the similarity ratio for calculating its volume. 

But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me confirm. The problem says "the smaller sphere has radius 3 cm" and "the larger sphere has radius 12 cm". So Sphere A is the smaller one, so its radius is 3 cm. Therefore, plugging into the volume formula directly would give the answer. However, sometimes problems may try to trick you by giving extra information. But in this case, since the question is straightforward, maybe it's just testing if I know the volume formula.

Alternatively, could the similarity ratio affect the volume? Well, for similar solids, the ratio of volumes is the cube of the ratio of corresponding linear measures. But since we already have the radius of Sphere A, we don't need that. Unless the problem was expecting me to calculate the volume using the ratio? But no, because the radius is given. 

So, the answer should simply be applying the volume formula with r=3. Let me compute that. Volume is (4/3)π*(3)^3. Calculating that: 3 cubed is 27, multiplied by 4/3 gives 27*(4/3) = 36. Then times π, so 36π cm³. That seems straightforward. 

Wait, but why mention that they are similar? Maybe the problem is designed to test understanding that even though they are similar, the volume can be found directly from the given radius. Alternatively, maybe there's a part missing? Let me re-read the problem statement.

The question says: "Consider the two similar spheres shown. The smaller sphere has radius 3 cm while the larger sphere has a radius of 12 cm." Find the volume of Sphere A. So, the fact that they are similar is given, but since we already have the radius of Sphere A, the similarity doesn't impact the calculation. Hence, the answer is straightforward.

Therefore, the volume of Sphere A is (4/3)π(3)^3 = 36π cm³. That's the answer. I think that's correct. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The problem uses the term "similar spheres," but since the radius is given, similarity ratio isn't required here. So yes, the answer is 36π cubic centimeters.
