QUESTION:
A hollow cylindrical pipe has the dimensions shown in the figure. The outer diameter is 2.1 centimeters. The inner diameter is 1.8 centimeters. The length is 13 centimeters.

The pipe is made of a particularly strong metal.

Calculate the weight of the pipe if 1 (cm)^3 of the metal weighs 5.3g , giving your answer correct to one decimal place.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we need to find the weight of a hollow cylindrical pipe. The given data includes the outer diameter, inner diameter, and length of the pipe. Also, we know the density of the metal, which is 5.3 grams per cubic centimeter. 

First, I remember that the weight of an object is its volume multiplied by its density. Since the pipe is hollow, it's like a cylinder with another smaller cylinder removed from the inside. So, the volume should be the difference between the volume of the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder. That makes sense because the material of the pipe is the space between the two cylinders.

Let me recall the formula for the volume of a cylinder. It's πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height (or length, in this case). But since there's an inner cylinder, I need to subtract the inner volume from the outer volume. 

Wait, the diameters are given, so I need to convert those to radii. The outer diameter is 2.1 cm, so the outer radius would be half of that, which is 1.05 cm. Similarly, the inner diameter is 1.8 cm, so the inner radius is 0.9 cm. The length of the pipe is 13 cm. 

So, calculating the volume of the outer cylinder first: π*(outer_radius)^2*height. Then the inner cylinder: π*(inner_radius)^2*height. Subtracting the two gives the volume of the metal in the pipe. 

Let me write that down:

Volume = π*(R² - r²)*h, where R is outer radius, r is inner radius, h is length.

Plugging in the numbers:

R = 2.1 / 2 = 1.05 cm
r = 1.8 / 2 = 0.9 cm
h = 13 cm

So Volume = π*( (1.05)^2 - (0.9)^2 ) * 13

Hmm, maybe I can compute (1.05)^2 and (0.9)^2 first. Let me calculate each term:

1.05 squared: 1.05 * 1.05. Let me do that multiplication. 1*1=1, 1*0.05=0.05, 0.05*1=0.05, 0.05*0.05=0.0025. Adding them up: 1 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.0025 = 1.1025. Wait, but actually, 1.05 * 1.05 is 1.1025. Correct.

Then 0.9 squared is 0.81. So the difference between these is 1.1025 - 0.81 = 0.2925. Then multiply by 13 cm. 

So Volume = π * 0.2925 * 13. Let me compute that. First, 0.2925 * 13. Let me calculate 0.2925 * 10 = 2.925, 0.2925 * 3 = 0.8775. Adding together: 2.925 + 0.8775 = 3.8025. So Volume ≈ π * 3.8025 cm³. 

Now, multiplying by π. Let me note that π is approximately 3.1416. So 3.8025 * 3.1416. Let me compute that. Hmm, perhaps I can do this more accurately. Alternatively, maybe I can keep it symbolic for now. However, since we need a numerical answer, we have to compute this.

But wait, maybe there's a better way to compute the difference of squares? Because (R² - r²) factors into (R - r)(R + r). Let me try that. Maybe that simplifies the calculation.

So, R - r = 1.05 - 0.9 = 0.15 cm

R + r = 1.05 + 0.9 = 1.95 cm

Therefore, Volume = π * (R - r)(R + r) * h = π * 0.15 * 1.95 * 13

Calculating 0.15 * 1.95 first. Let me compute 0.15 * 1.95. Well, 0.15 * 2 = 0.3, minus 0.15 * 0.05 = 0.0075. So 0.3 - 0.0075 = 0.2925. Which matches the previous result. Then multiply by 13: 0.2925 * 13 = 3.8025. So same as before. So Volume = π * 3.8025 cm³.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute this more precisely. Let me check the exact value. Let me see:

Original terms:

(R - r) = 0.15 cm

(R + r) = 1.95 cm

Multiply those two: 0.15 * 1.95. Let me compute that again. 1.95 * 0.15. Breaking down:

1.95 * 0.1 = 0.195

1.95 * 0.05 = 0.0975

Adding them: 0.195 + 0.0975 = 0.2925. Same as before.

Then times 13: 0.2925 * 13. Let me do that multiplication:

Well, 0.2925 * 10 = 2.925

0.2925 * 3 = 0.8775

Total is 2.925 + 0.8775 = 3.8025 cm³. So Volume = π * 3.8025 cm³.

Now, calculating the numerical value. Let's take π ≈ 3.1416. So 3.8025 * 3.1416. Let me compute this:

First, approximate 3.8025 * 3 = 11.4075

Then 3.8025 * 0.1416. Let me compute that part. 

Breaking down 0.1416 into 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.0016.

Compute 3.8025 * 0.1 = 0.38025

3.8025 * 0.04 = 0.1521

3.8025 * 0.0016 = approx 0.006084

Add them up: 0.38025 + 0.1521 = 0.53235 + 0.006084 ≈ 0.538434

So total Volume ≈ 11.4075 + 0.538434 ≈ 11.945934 cm³

Wait, but wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, no. Wait, the original was 3.8025 * π, not 3.8025 * 3.1416. Wait, no. Wait, π is approximately 3.1416. Therefore, Volume ≈ 3.8025 * 3.1416 ≈ ?

Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 3.8025 * π directly. Let me use a calculator-like approach here. Let me think of π as 3.1416.

So 3.8025 × 3.1416.

Let me write that out:

First, multiply 3.8025 × 3 = 11.4075

Then 3.8025 × 0.1416.

As above, which gave us approximately 0.5384.

So total ≈ 11.4075 + 0.5384 ≈ 11.9459 cm³.

But wait, let me verify this with another method. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 3.8025 × π with more accurate decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use fractions. But given that the numbers are decimals, maybe decimal approximation is better.

Alternatively, perhaps I can carry out the multiplication more accurately. Let me attempt:

Let me consider π ≈ 3.14159265.

So Volume ≈ 3.8025 × 3.14159265.

Let me compute that:

First, 3 × 3.8025 = 11.4075

Then 0.14159265 × 3.8025.

Let me compute 0.1 × 3.8025 = 0.38025

0.04 × 3.8025 = 0.1521

0.00159265 × 3.8025 ≈ Let's compute 0.001 × 3.8025 = 0.0038025, and 0.00059265 × 3.8025 ≈ approx 0.002256.

So adding up:

0.38025 + 0.1521 = 0.53235

Plus 0.0038025 + 0.002256 ≈ 0.0060585

Total ≈ 0.53235 + 0.0060585 ≈ 0.5384085

Thus total Volume ≈ 11.4075 + 0.5384085 ≈ 11.9459 cm³.

So approximately 11.9459 cm³. Let me check with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use calculator-like steps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use exact fractions. Wait, but given the decimal values, perhaps decimal is fine.

So Volume ≈ 11.9459 cm³. Now, the next step is to multiply this by the density, which is 5.3 g/cm³.

So Weight = Volume × Density = 11.9459 × 5.3 grams.

Let me compute that.

First, 10 × 5.3 = 53

1.9459 × 5.3. Let me break that down:

1.9459 × 5 = 9.7295

1.9459 × 0.3 = 0.58377

Adding those together: 9.7295 + 0.58377 = 10.31327

So total Weight ≈ 53 + 10.31327 = 63.31327 grams.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the Volume was 11.9459 cm³. So 11.9459 × 5.3.

Alternatively, perhaps breaking down 11.9459 × 5.3:

Let me think of it as (12 - 0.0541) × 5.3.

But maybe easier to compute:

11.9459 × 5 = 59.7295

11.9459 × 0.3 = 3.58377

Adding those gives 59.7295 + 3.58377 = 63.31327 grams.

So approximately 63.313 grams. The question says to give the answer correct to one decimal place. So rounding 63.313... to one decimal is 63.3 grams. Wait, but let me check the precise calculation again.

Wait, but maybe my earlier approximation of the Volume had some errors due to rounding. Let me check whether I should carry more decimal places for accuracy.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the Volume more accurately. Let me go back.

Original Volume computation:

(R² - r²) = (1.05² - 0.9²) = (1.1025 - 0.81) = 0.2925 cm². Multiply by height 13 cm: 0.2925 * 13 = 3.8025 cm³. Then multiply by π: 3.8025π cm³.

If I use a more precise value of π, say π ≈ 3.1415926536.

So Volume = 3.8025 × π ≈ 3.8025 × 3.1415926536.

Let me compute this with higher precision.

Let me perform the multiplication:

3.8025 × 3.1415926536.

Breakdown:

First, 3 × 3.1415926536 = 9.4247779608

Then 0.8 × 3.1415926536 = 2.5132741229

Then 0.0025 × 3.1415926536 ≈ 0.0078539816

Adding these together:

9.4247779608 + 2.5132741229 = 11.9380520837

Then add 0.0078539816: 11.9380520837 + 0.0078539816 ≈ 11.9459060653 cm³.

So Volume ≈ 11.945906 cm³.

Then multiply by 5.3 g/cm³:

11.945906 × 5.3.

Let me compute this precisely:

First, 11.945906 × 5 = 59.72953

Then 11.945906 × 0.3 = 3.5837718

Summing these: 59.72953 + 3.5837718 = 63.3133018 grams.

So approximately 63.3133 grams. Rounded to one decimal place, that's 63.3 grams. But wait, the third decimal is 3, which is less than 5, so we round down. Hence, 63.3 grams.

But wait, let me check once more. Is there any chance that during the initial steps, I miscalculated?

Alternative approach: Let's recalculate Volume using exact fractions.

Given that the diameters are 2.1 and 1.8 cm, so radii are 1.05 and 0.9 cm.

Volume = π*(R² - r²)*h = π*( (1.05)^2 - (0.9)^2 )*13.

Which is π*( (1.05 - 0.9)*(1.05 + 0.9) )*13 = π*(0.15)*(1.95)*13.

Compute 0.15 * 1.95 = 0.2925, then *13 = 3.8025. So Volume = π * 3.8025 cm³. So that's correct.

So Volume is π * 3.8025 cm³. Then multiply by 5.3 g/cm³ gives:

Weight = 5.3 * π * 3.8025.

Let me compute this as follows:

First compute 5.3 * 3.8025. Let me do that:

5 * 3.8025 = 19.0125

0.3 * 3.8025 = 1.14075

Total: 19.0125 + 1.14075 = 20.15325

Then multiply by π: 20.15325 * π grams.

Using π ≈ 3.1416:

20.15325 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Let me compute 20 × 3.1416 = 62.832

Then 0.15325 × 3.1416 ≈ ?

Compute 0.1 × 3.1416 = 0.31416

0.05 × 3.1416 = 0.15708

0.00325 × 3.1416 ≈ 0.0101958

Adding these: 0.31416 + 0.15708 = 0.47124 + 0.0101958 ≈ 0.4814358

Total Weight ≈ 62.832 + 0.4814358 ≈ 63.3134358 grams.

Same as before. So approximately 63.313 grams. Rounded to one decimal place, 63.3 grams.

But wait, hold on! Let me check if the question requires considering significant figures or if there's any other factor. The given values are:

Outer Diameter: 2.1 cm (two significant figures?), Inner Diameter: 1.8 cm (two), Length: 13 cm (maybe two or ambiguous). However, the density is given as 5.3 g/cm³ (two decimal places, but possibly two significant figures).

However, the problem says "correct to one decimal place", so regardless of significant figures, we need to present the answer with one decimal place. Our computed value is approximately 63.313 grams, which rounds to 63.3 grams. 

But let me confirm once more. Perhaps I made a mistake in the Volume calculation? Let me cross-validate.

Another way: Compute the volume of the outer cylinder and inner cylinder separately.

Outer Cylinder Volume: π * R² * h = π * (1.05)^2 * 13

Inner Cylinder Volume: π * r² * h = π * (0.9)^2 * 13

Subtracting:

Volume = π * 13 * [(1.05)^2 - (0.9)^2]

We already did that, resulting in π * 13 * 0.2925 = π * 3.8025 cm³.

Yes, same as before.

So the Volume is indeed π * 3.8025 cm³. Multiplying by 5.3 gives:

5.3 * π * 3.8025 ≈ 5.3 * 3.8025 * π ≈ 20.15325 * π ≈ 63.313 grams.

Hence, the weight is approximately 63.3 grams when rounded to one decimal place.

But let me check if there's any error in the initial step. For example, did I correctly calculate the difference between the outer and inner radii?

Wait, the diameters are given as 2.1 cm and 1.8 cm. So radii are 1.05 and 0.9 cm. Yes, correct.

Another possible mistake: Did I use the correct formula for the volume of a hollow cylinder? Yes, the volume is the area of the annulus (the region between the two circles) multiplied by the length. Which is π(R² - r²)h. Correct.

Another thing to check: Units. All measurements are in centimeters, so the volume is in cm³, and the density is in g/cm³, so the weight is in grams. Correct.

Therefore, the answer should be 63.3 grams. But let me check once again with more precise calculation.

Let me calculate 5.3 * π * 3.8025 numerically.

First, compute 5.3 * 3.8025:

As before, 5.3 * 3.8025.

Let me compute 3.8025 × 5 = 19.0125

3.8025 × 0.3 = 1.14075

Total: 19.0125 + 1.14075 = 20.15325

Then multiply by π:

20.15325 × π ≈ 20.15325 × 3.1415926535 ≈ ?

Let me compute this:

Take 20.15325 × 3.1415926535.

Approximate this as:

Let me note that π ≈ 3.1415926535.

So 20.15325 × π ≈ ?

Well, 20 × π = 62.83185307...

Then 0.15325 × π ≈ 0.15325 × 3.1416 ≈ 0.4814.

Adding to 62.83185 + 0.4814 ≈ 63.31325 grams.

Yes, so 63.313 grams. Rounded to one decimal place, 63.3 grams.

But let me check with a calculator-like approach. Suppose I have access to a calculator, what would be the exact value?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. For instance, using exact decimal values without approximating π early on.

But given that the problem allows for rounding to one decimal place, our answer of 63.3 grams is correct. However, sometimes problems expect more precise handling of intermediate steps. Let me check if there's any alternative calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more exact decimal representations. Let me recompute the entire process with more precise steps.

Let me start over:

Outer radius R = 2.1 / 2 = 1.05 cm.

Inner radius r = 1.8 / 2 = 0.9 cm.

Height h = 13 cm.

Volume = π*(R² - r²)*h = π*( (1.05)^2 - (0.9)^2 ) *13.

Compute R² - r²:

(1.05)^2 = 1.1025

(0.9)^2 = 0.81

Difference: 1.1025 - 0.81 = 0.2925 cm².

Multiply by h = 13 cm: 0.2925 * 13 = 3.8025 cm³.

Multiply by π: 3.8025 * π cm³.

Now, compute 3.8025 * π:

Let me use more decimal places for π, say π = 3.141592653589793.

So 3.8025 * π = 3.8025 * 3.141592653589793.

Let me compute this:

First, multiply 3 * π = 9.42477796076938

Then 0.8025 * π = ?

Compute 0.8 * π = 2.5132741228718345

0.0025 * π = 0.007853981633974483

Adding these: 2.5132741228718345 + 0.007853981633974483 ≈ 2.521128104505809

Total Volume = 9.42477796076938 + 2.521128104505809 ≈ 11.945906065275189 cm³.

Then multiply by density 5.3 g/cm³:

11.945906065275189 * 5.3 = ?

Let me compute this:

First, 11.945906065275189 × 5 = 59.729530326375945

Then 11.945906065275189 × 0.3 = 3.5837718195825567

Adding them: 59.729530326375945 + 3.5837718195825567 ≈ 63.3133021459585 grams.

So, approximately 63.3133 grams. Rounded to one decimal place: 63.3 grams.

Therefore, the final answer is 63.3 grams. 

I think this confirms that the answer is correct. There doesn't seem to be any mistakes in the calculations. All steps were verified multiple times, and the result consistently comes out to around 63.3 grams when rounded appropriately.
