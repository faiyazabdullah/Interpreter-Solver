QUESTION:
The logo of a shop consists of five semicircles; four small semicircles each with the same radius, and one large semicircle. The perimeter of the whole shape is 14\pi  units.
The entire shape is to be enlarged by a factor of 5 to form a logo sticker on the window of a shop front. What area of the shop front window will the sticker take up?

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. The problem involves a logo made up of five semicircles: four small ones with the same radius and one larger semicircle. The total perimeter of this shape is given as 14π units. Then, we have to find the area of the shop front window after enlarging the entire shape by a factor of 5.

Alright, starting with the first part: figuring out the radii of the semicircles. Let me recall that the perimeter of a semicircle isn't just half the circumference of a full circle. Wait, actually, the perimeter of a semicircle includes the curved part plus the diameter, right? But wait, hold on—if these semicircles are arranged in a way where some sides are internal, maybe they don't contribute to the overall perimeter? Hmm, the problem says it's a logo consisting of five semicircles. Maybe they're arranged like a larger semicircle with smaller ones attached? Or perhaps overlapping? Wait, but since it's a perimeter, maybe the arrangement is such that when you put them together, some diameters are internal and not part of the outer perimeter.

Wait, the problem mentions "the perimeter of the whole shape". So, if there are five semicircles, but some of their straight edges are connected, so those would not contribute to the perimeter. Let me think about how these semicircles could be arranged. A common configuration for such problems is a large semicircle with smaller semicircles on top or bottom. Alternatively, maybe they form something like a chain or a flower-like shape. But without a diagram, I need to rely on standard configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps the figure is similar to a Reuleaux polygon, but with semicircles. However, another possibility is that the four small semicircles are arranged such that their diameters form the base of the large semicircle. Wait, let me try to visualize: imagine a large semicircle, and then four smaller semicircles whose diameters are along the diameter of the large semicircle. But how would that work? If the four small semicircles are placed on either side, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, think of the classic example where a semicircle has two smaller semicircles on its diameter, creating a sort of lens shape. But with four small semicircles... Maybe the large semicircle is constructed from the combination of the four small ones? No, that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe the shape is formed by having four small semicircles arranged in such a way that their diameters are aligned with the diameter of the large semicircle. For instance, suppose the large semicircle has diameter AB, and then four smaller semicircles are drawn on segments AC, CD, DE, EB, where C, D, E divide AB into four equal parts. But then each small semicircle would have radius r, and the large semicircle would have radius R. But how does the perimeter come into play?

But in this case, the perimeter of the whole shape would be the sum of the circumferences of the individual semicircles minus the overlapping parts. Wait, but if the small semicircles are on the diameter of the large one, then their diameters are parts of the large semicircle's diameter. Therefore, when calculating the total perimeter, the inner edges (the diameters of the small semicircles) would not contribute because they are internal. So the total perimeter would consist of the curved parts of all the semicircles.

So, for example, if there are four small semicircles, each with radius r, then their curved parts would contribute 4*(πr). And the large semicircle would have a curved part of πR. Therefore, total perimeter would be πR + 4πr = 14π. That equation would give us R + 4r = 14.

But also, there's a relationship between R and r based on the arrangement. If the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large semicircle, then the length of the diameter of the large semicircle would be equal to the sum of the diameters of the small semicircles. Since each small semicircle has diameter 2r, four of them would make 4*2r = 8r. Hence, the diameter of the large semicircle is 8r, so R = 4r.

Therefore, substituting R = 4r into R + 4r = 14 gives 4r + 4r = 8r =14 → r=14/8=7/4. Then R=4*(7/4)=7.

Wait, but let me check again. Suppose the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large semicircle. Each small semicircle's diameter is 2r, so four of them would make 8r. Thus, the diameter of the large semicircle is 8r, hence R = 4r. Therefore, the total perimeter is πR + 4*(πr) = π(4r + 4r) = π*8r = 14π. Therefore, 8r =14 → r=14/8=7/4. Then R=4*(7/4)=7. So that works.

But wait, the problem states that there are five semicircles: four small ones and one large. So the total perimeter would be the sum of their perimeters, but considering overlapping edges. If the four small semicircles are on the diameter of the large one, then their diameters are internal. Therefore, the perimeter would be the sum of the curved parts. Which is πR + 4*(πr). As above.

Alternatively, maybe the four small semicircles are arranged in a different way. For example, maybe they are attached to the ends of the large semicircle. But that might not fit. Let me think again.

Another possibility is that the four small semicircles are arranged such that their diameters form the base of the large semicircle. For example, if the large semicircle is sitting on top of four smaller semicircles arranged around it. But that seems more complicated. Alternatively, think of the shape as a large semicircle with four smaller semicircles inside it, but that may not necessarily affect the perimeter unless they are subtracted.

But given that the problem says the perimeter is 14π, and the given equations involve RadiusOf(1) equals RadiusOf(2), etc., which suggests that Circles 1,2,3,4 have the same radius, and Circle 5 has radius R. Wait, looking back at the given predicates:

"Circle(1)
Circle(2)
Circle(3)
Circle(4)
Circle(5)
Equals(RadiusOf(1),RadiusOf(2))
Equals(RadiusOf(2),RadiusOf(3))
Equals(RadiusOf(3),RadiusOf(4))
Let(r,RadiusOf(1))
Let(R,RadiusOf(5))
PerimeterOf(Shape(1,2,3,4,5)) 
Equals(PerimeterOf(Shape(1,2,3,4,5)),Mul(14,PI))
Add(Mul(4,r),R,14)
Equals(Mul(4,r), Sub(14,R))"

So, according to the given predicates, Circles 1,2,3,4 have the same radius r, and Circle 5 has radius R. Also, the perimeter of the shape composed of these five circles is 14π. Then there's Add(Mul(4,r),R,14): which probably means that 4r + R =14. Then Equals(Mul(4,r),Sub(14,R)): which implies that 4r =14 - R. 

So combining these two equations: From the first equation, 4r + R =14. From the second equation, 4r =14 - R. Which is consistent. So that's just confirming the same equation. So we have 4r + R =14. But we need another relation between r and R to solve for them. 

Ah, but how do we get that? It must come from the geometry of the shape. The Shape(1,2,3,4,5) refers to the combination of these five circles. How are they arranged? The problem statement says the logo consists of five semicircles: four small with same radius and one large. So the Shape(1,2,3,4,5) is likely a composite shape made of these semicircles. 

Assuming that the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large semicircle, as previously thought. In that case, the diameter of the large semicircle is equal to the combined diameters of the four small ones. Each small semicircle has diameter 2r, so total is 4*2r =8r. Therefore, the radius of the large semicircle is 4r. Hence, R =4r. 

Then substituting into 4r + R =14, we get 4r +4r =8r=14 ⇒ r=14/8=7/4. Then R=4*(7/4)=7. 

Thus, the radii are r=7/4 and R=7. 

Now, the next part of the problem is to enlarge the entire shape by a scale factor of 5. The question asks for the area of the shop front window that the sticker will take up. 

But wait, the original shape's perimeter is given, and we need to find the area after scaling. However, the problem mentions that the entire shape is scaled by 5. To find the area after scaling, we need to know the original area, then multiply by the square of the scale factor. 

However, we need to clarify what the original area is. But the original shape is a combination of semicircles. Let me think: the original shape's area would be the sum of the areas of the five semicircles. Wait, but depending on the arrangement, some areas might overlap or be internal. Wait, but in the case where the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large one, the total area would be the area of the large semicircle plus the areas of the four small semicircles. Because if the small semicircles are attached to the diameter, their areas are added. 

Wait, no—wait, if the four small semicircles are part of the boundary, but their diameters are internal, then their areas are still part of the total area. Wait, no. Wait, the area of the entire shape would depend on how the semicircles are combined. For example, if the large semicircle contains the four smaller ones, but that depends on the configuration. 

Alternatively, perhaps the shape is similar to a rectangle with semicircular ends, but that doesn't fit. Let me go back to the initial assumption. If the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large semicircle, then the entire figure would look like a large semicircle with four smaller semicircles attached to its diameter. But in that case, the area would be the area of the large semicircle plus the areas of the four small semicircles. 

Calculating that: Area of large semicircle is (1/2)πR², and each small semicircle is (1/2)πr². Four of them would be 4*(1/2)πr² = 2πr². Total area would be (1/2)πR² + 2πr². 

But if the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large semicircle, then their diameters are parts of the large semicircle's diameter, so their areas are separate. So yes, adding them. 

Alternatively, if the four small semicircles are somehow inside the large one, but that would require the large semicircle to enclose them, but that's not indicated. Given the problem says the logo consists of five semicircles, so it's more likely that all are on the outside. 

But let me confirm with the given equations. The problem says the perimeter is 14π, and we found that 4r + R =14. But how did we get that? Because the perimeter is the sum of the curved parts. 

In the case where the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large one, their straight edges (diameters) are internal, so not contributing to the perimeter. Therefore, the total perimeter is the sum of the curved parts: each small semicircle contributes πr (since circumference of a semicircle is πd/2 = π*(2r)/2 = πr), and the large semicircle contributes πR. Therefore, total perimeter is πR + 4πr = π(R + 4r) =14π. Hence, R +4r=14. 

Which matches the given equation. Therefore, our earlier calculation holds. 

So, once we have R and r, we can compute the original area. Then, when we scale the shape by 5, the area scales by the square of the scale factor, i.e., 5²=25. 

So, the original area is (1/2)πR² + 4*(1/2)πr² = (1/2)πR² + 2πr². 

Plugging in R=7 and r=7/4:

Original area = (1/2)*π*(7)² + 2π*(7/4)² 

Calculate each term:

First term: (1/2)*π*49 = (49/2)π

Second term: 2π*(49/16) = (98/16)π = (49/8)π

Total original area = (49/2 + 49/8)π = convert to eighths: 196/8 +49/8 = 245/8 π 

So original area is 245/8 π. 

Then, when scaled by factor 5, the new area is 25 times the original area: 25*(245/8)π = (245*25)/8 π 

Compute 245*25: 245*25 = (200*25) + (45*25) = 5000 + 1125 = 6125 

Hence, the area of the window is 6125/8 π. 

But let me verify if my assumption about the area is correct. Is the total area indeed the sum of all the semicircles' areas? 

If the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large semicircle, then their areas are all external and not overlapping with the large one. Hence, adding them. 

But another way to think: if the large semicircle is over the four small ones, but that would mean overlapping. However, given that the perimeter is calculated as the sum of the curved parts, implying that the straight edges are internal. Therefore, the area should be the sum of all the semicircles' areas. 

Alternatively, perhaps the shape is a closed loop formed by the semicircles. For example, if you have a large semicircle with four smaller semicircles on its diameter, forming a sort of rounded rectangle. But regardless, the area would be the sum of the individual areas. 

Therefore, proceeding with that calculation. 

So the original area is 245/8 π, scaled by 25 gives 6125/8 π. Simplify that fraction: 6125 divided by 8. 

But maybe there's a simpler way to express this. Let me check if 245/8 *25 simplifies. 245*25=6125. Yes. 

Alternatively, 245/8 π multiplied by 25 is 245*25 /8 π = 6125/8 π. 

But let me check if there's a mistake in the area calculation. Another thought: maybe the shape is a single continuous curve made up of the semicircles, so overlapping regions are not counted twice. However, in the case where the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large one, they don't overlap with each other or the large semicircle. So their areas are distinct. 

Alternatively, if the four small semicircles are arranged such that their diameters are the same as the diameter of the large semicircle, but then the large semicircle would have diameter equal to the sum of the diameters of the small ones. Wait, earlier we had that the diameter of the large semicircle is 8r, making R=4r. 

Yes, that was the key relationship. 

Therefore, with that, the area calculation seems correct. 

So, the final area after scaling is 6125/8 π. But let me see if that reduces further. 6125 divided by 8 is 765.625. But maybe the problem expects an exact fraction. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me recheck the area computation:

Original area:

Large semicircle: (1/2)πR² = (1/2)π*(7)^2 = 49/2 π

Four small semicircles: each is (1/2)πr², so total 4*(1/2)πr² = 2πr². With r=7/4, so:

2π*(7/4)^2 = 2π*(49/16) = 49π/8

Adding to the large semicircle area:

49/2 π + 49/8 π = Convert 49/2 to 196/8, so 196/8 +49/8 =245/8 π. Correct. 

Multiply by 25: 245/8 *25 = (245*25)/8 = 6125/8 π. 

Yes. 

But let me check if there's another interpretation of the shape. Suppose instead that the four small semicircles are all attached to the large semicircle's arc, forming a sort of flower petal shape. But then the perimeter would include all the curves, but the area would be different. However, the perimeter calculation would still be the same as before because the straight edges would be internal. 

Alternatively, maybe the shape is a large semicircle with four small semicircles indented into it, but that would change the perimeter. However, since the problem states that the perimeter is 14π, and we arrived at that via assuming that the straight edges are internal, leading to R +4r=14, which fits with the given equations. 

Therefore, proceeding with that, the area is 6125/8 π. 

But let me check the problem statement again regarding the ScaleFactorOf(Shape(1,2,3,4,5), Shape(6), 5). This indicates that the entire shape is scaled by 5. So the area scales by 5²=25. 

Thus, the area of the sticker is 25 times the original area. 

So the final answer is 6125/8 π. 

But let me check if this can be simplified further. 6125 ÷ 8 is 765.625. But since the problem might prefer fractional form, 6125/8 π is acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the area is the sum of the semicircles. Let me consider another possibility: the shape might be a single closed curve made by connecting the semicircles, so that some parts are internal. For example, if the four small semicircles are on the diameter of the large one, then the total area would be the area of the large semicircle minus the areas of the small ones? No, that wouldn't make sense because the small ones are added. 

Wait, think of it as a composite shape. Imagine the large semicircle with four smaller semicircles attached to its diameter. The total area would be the area of the large semicircle plus the areas of the four small semicircles. Because they are all part of the exterior. So yes, adding them. 

Therefore, the calculation is correct. 

Thus, the area after scaling is 6125/8 π. 

But let me check if there's another way to arrive at this answer. For example, using the given equations. 

We were told that Mul(4,r) + R =14. So 4r + R =14. Also, from the perimeter, we have that R=4r. 

Wait, earlier we deduced R=4r from the geometry. But the problem didn't state that explicitly. Wait, how did we get R=4r? Because if the four small semicircles are arranged along the diameter of the large one, then the diameter of the large semicircle equals the sum of the diameters of the small ones. 

Each small semicircle has diameter 2r, so four of them sum to 8r, which is the diameter of the large semicircle. Hence, R = 8r /2 =4r. 

So that gives us R=4r. 

So substituting into 4r + R =14: 4r +4r=8r=14 ⇒ r=14/8=7/4. Then R=4*(7/4)=7. 

So that's correct. 

Thus, the original area is (1/2)πR² +4*(1/2)πr² = (1/2)πR² +2πr². Plugging R=7, r=7/4:

(1/2)*(49)π + 2*(49/16)π = 49/2 π + 49/8 π = (196 +49)/8 π =245/8 π. 

Scaling by 25 gives 245/8 *25 π= 6125/8 π. 

Yes. 

So the final answer is 6125/8 π. 

But let me check if the problem requires numerical approximation. However, since the original perimeter was given in terms of π, it's likely that the answer should remain in terms of π. So 6125/8 π. 

But 6125 divided by 8 can be simplified? Let me see. 6125 ÷ 5 = 1225. 8 is 2³. Not sure if it can be reduced further. 

Alternatively, write it as a mixed number, but in exams usually improper fractions are preferred. 

Hence, Final Answer: \boxed{\dfrac{6125}{8}\pi}

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Predicate Analysis and Setup

We are given several geometric entities involving circles:

- `Circle(1)` to `Circle(5)`
- Radii relations:
  - `Equals(RadiusOf(1), RadiusOf(2))`
  - `Equals(RadiusOf(2), RadiusOf(3))`
  - `Equals(RadiusOf(3), RadiusOf(4))`

This tells us that circles 1, 2, 3, and 4 all share the same radius, say `r`, while circle 5 has a different radius, denoted as `R`.

Additionally:
- `PerimeterOf(Shape(1,2,3,4,5))` is defined and set equal to `14π`.
- There is a relation:  
  `Add(Mul(4,r), R, 14)` → This translates to the equation:  
  $$
  4r + R = 14
  $$

---

### Step 2: Constraint Synthesis

From the above, we have:
$$
4r + R = 14 \tag{1}
$$

To proceed, we need a second independent equation relating `r` and `R`. This comes from understanding the **geometric arrangement** of the circles.

A natural interpretation is that the **four small semicircles** are arranged **along the diameter of the large semicircle**, such that the total length of the diameter of the large semicircle equals the sum of the diameters of the four small ones.

Each small semicircle has diameter $2r$, so the total length of the four small diameters is:
$$
4 \times 2r = 8r
$$
Thus, the **diameter of the large semicircle** is $8r$, giving:
$$
R = 4r \tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solution Strategy

Using equations (1) and (2):
$$
4r + R = 14 \\
R = 4r
$$

Substitute equation (2) into equation (1):
$$
4r + 4r = 14 \Rightarrow 8r = 14 \Rightarrow r = \frac{7}{4}
$$

Then:
$$
R = 4r = 4 \cdot \frac{7}{4} = 7
$$

---

### Step 4: Mathematical Derivation

#### Original Area Calculation

The shape consists of:
- One large semicircle with radius $R = 7$
- Four smaller semicircles, each with radius $r = \frac{7}{4}$

The **area of a semicircle** is:
$$
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
$$

So, the total area of the shape is:
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 + 4 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2\right) = \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 + 2 \pi r^2
$$

Plug in $R = 7$ and $r = \frac{7}{4}$:
$$
\text{Area}_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (7)^2 + 2 \pi \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^2 = \frac{49}{2} \pi + 2 \pi \cdot \frac{49}{16} = \frac{49}{2} \pi + \frac{49}{8} \pi
$$

Convert to a common denominator:
$$
\frac{49}{2} = \frac{196}{8}, \quad \frac{196}{8} + \frac{49}{8} = \frac{245}{8} \pi
$$

So the **original area** is:
$$
\frac{245}{8} \pi
$$

#### Scaling by Factor of 5

When a shape is scaled by a factor of $k$, its **area increases by** $k^2$. Here, $k = 5$, so the new area is:
$$
\text{New Area} = \left( \frac{245}{8} \pi \right) \cdot 25 = \frac{6125}{8} \pi
$$

---

### Step 5: Verification and Final Answer

All geometric assumptions align with the given constraints. The computed area is consistent with the perimeter condition and the scaling transformation.

$$
\text{Final Answer: } \boxed{\dfrac{6125}{8}\pi}
$$
