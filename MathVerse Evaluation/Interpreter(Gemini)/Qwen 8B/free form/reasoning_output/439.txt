<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out the coordinates of point A. So, the problem says that point A is on a unit circle with radius 1, forming a red right triangle with an angle of π/4. Let me break down the given information step by step.

First, the Circle(1) has a radius of 1, which means it's a unit circle. The Point(A) lies on this circle, so its distance from the center should be 1. Also, there's a Triangle(1) which is right-angled and red. The measure of one of its angles is π/4 radians, which is 45 degrees. 

Since it's a right triangle, one of the angles is 90 degrees, and another is π/4, making the third angle π/4 as well because the sum of angles in a triangle is π radians. Wait, no—if one angle is π/2 (right angle) and another is π/4, then the third angle would be π - π/2 - π/4 = π/4. So it's a 45-45-90 triangle. That means the legs are equal in length, and the hypotenuse is √2 times longer than each leg.

Now, since the triangle is formed with point A, I need to figure out how the triangle is constructed. The problem mentions that the triangle is red, but maybe that's just a color attribute and not directly relevant to coordinates. The key here is that point A is part of this right triangle, and the triangle has a right angle. Also, the angle mentioned is π/4, which is one of the non-right angles.

Let me consider the standard position of points on a unit circle. If the triangle is right-angled and has a π/4 angle, perhaps the right angle is at the origin? Or maybe at another vertex. Wait, the triangle could have vertices at three points: the origin, point A, and another point. Since it's a right triangle, two sides would be perpendicular.

The problem also mentions that Line(0,A) is a radius of the circle. Wait, the IsRadiusOf(Line(0,A), Circle(1)) implies that line segment from point 0 to point A is a radius of the circle. Therefore, point 0 is the center of the circle. But wait, the predicate says Equals(0,0)—so point 0 is at (0,0)? Because Point(0) and Point(0,0) are mentioned. Wait, maybe there's some confusion here. Let me parse the given predicates again.

Looking back, there's a Point(0) and Point(0,0). Then there's a Line(3,4), and several PointLiesOnLine statements. However, focusing on the main elements: the unit circle with radius 1, point A on it, forming a red right triangle with an angle of π/4. Also, the triangle's right angle is Angle(2), which is a right angle, and there's a Perpendicular(Line(A,2), Line(2,0)). Hmm, this seems complicated.

Wait, let me re-express all given predicates more carefully:

- Point(A): A is a point.
- Circle(1): There is a circle named 1.
- PointLiesOnCircle(A,1): Point A lies on circle 1.
- RadiusOf(1): The radius of circle 1.
- Equals(RadiusOf(1),1): The radius of circle 1 is 1. So circle 1 is a unit circle centered at... Well, if Line(0,A) is a radius, then the center of the circle must be point 0. Because IsRadiusOf(Line(0,A), Circle(1)) implies that the line from 0 to A is a radius. Hence, the center of the circle is point 0.

So, point 0 is the center of the circle. Then, since the circle has radius 1, the distance from point 0 to point A is 1. Also, point 0 is at (0,0)? Wait, there's a Point(0) and Point(0,0). Maybe point 0 is the origin. Let me check the other predicates.

There's also Point(0,0). Wait, maybe point 0 refers to the origin (0,0). So the circle is centered at (0,0), and point A lies somewhere on it. Now, the triangle is right-angled. Let's think about the triangle's vertices. It's a right triangle with one angle being π/4. Let me assume that the right angle is at point 0, the center of the circle. Then the triangle would have vertices at 0, A, and another point B such that angle at 0 is the right angle. But then the triangle would have legs OA and OB, where O is the center (point 0), and hypotenuse AB. However, the angle at A or B would be π/4. Alternatively, the right angle could be at point A or at point B.

Alternatively, maybe the triangle has vertices at A, another point on the circle, and the origin. Let me think. Suppose the triangle is formed by points A, the origin (O), and another point B such that angle at O is the right angle. Then OA and OB are radii, each of length 1. If angle at O is right, then triangle OAB is a right triangle with legs OA and OB. Then the angle at A or B would depend on the configuration.

But the problem states that the triangle has an angle of π/4. So if the right angle is at O, then angles at A and B would be complementary. If one of them is π/4, then the other would be π/4 as well, making it an isoceles right triangle. In that case, OA and OB would be equal, so points A and B would be separated by 90 degrees on the circle. But then the triangle OAB would have legs OA and OB of length 1, hypotenuse AB of length √2. However, the angle at A would be π/4. Let me verify that.

In triangle OAB, right-angled at O. Then tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent = OB / OA = 1/1 = 1. So angle at A is arctan(1) = π/4. Yes! So this fits. So if the triangle has a right angle at O (the origin), and points A and B are on the circle, then angle at A is π/4. Thus, the triangle in question is OAB, with O at (0,0), A at some point on the unit circle, and B at another point such that OA and OB are perpendicular.

But how do we find the coordinates of point A? Well, since the triangle is right-angled at O, and angle at A is π/4, then the triangle OAB is a 45-45-90 triangle. Wait, but if OA and OB are perpendicular and equal in length (both radius 1), then triangle OAB is a right isoceles triangle, so angles at A and B are both π/4. Therefore, the coordinates of A and B would be such that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors of length 1. 

However, without knowing the specific location of point B, how do we determine A? Wait, but maybe the triangle is not necessarily with the right angle at O. Let me check other possibilities.

Another possibility: the right angle is at point A. Then, the triangle has vertices at A, B, and C, with the right angle at A. The angle at A is π/4? No, the right angle is π/2. Wait, the problem says "forms a red right triangle with an angle of π/4". So the triangle has a right angle (π/2) and another angle of π/4. So the third angle is π/4 as well. So it's an isoceles right triangle. So the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is √2 times a leg.

Assuming that the right angle is at point A. Then, the triangle would have legs AB and AC, with AB=AC, and BC as hypotenuse. But how does point A lie on the circle?

Alternatively, maybe the right angle is at point B. But regardless, the key is that the triangle has a right angle and a π/4 angle, making it an isoceles right triangle. So the sides must satisfy Pythagoras' theorem. Let me try to model this.

Let me suppose that the right angle is at the origin (point 0). Then, points A and B are on the circle (radius 1), and OA and OB are perpendicular. Then, the triangle OAB is right-angled at O, with OA and OB as legs. Then, OA = OB = 1, so AB = sqrt(2). The angles at A and B would be π/4 each. Therefore, the triangle satisfies the condition of having an angle of π/4. 

If this is the case, then point A is on the unit circle, and point B is another point such that OB is perpendicular to OA. However, since the problem only mentions point A and doesn't mention point B, maybe there's another way to interpret this. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle has vertices at A, the origin, and another point, say, point C, such that angle at C is π/4. Wait, but the triangle is right-angled. So if the right angle is at C, then angles at A and B would add up to π/2. If one of those angles is π/4, then the other would be π/4 as well. 

This is getting confusing. Let me look back at the given predicates. There's a Right(Triangle(1)), which is the triangle in question. Also, there's a RightAngle(Angle(2)), and Perpendicular(Line(A,2), Line(2,0)). This suggests that there's a right angle at point 2, with lines connecting A to 2 and 2 to 0 being perpendicular. 

Wait, the Perpendicular(Line(A,2), Line(2,0)) indicates that line segments A-2 and 2-0 are perpendicular. So the right angle is at point 2. Therefore, the triangle has vertices at A, 2, and 0, with the right angle at point 2. 

Therefore, triangle with vertices A, 2, and 0, right-angled at 2. And one of the angles (probably at A or 0) is π/4. Let me confirm:

In triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2. Then angles at A and 0 sum to π/2. One of these angles is π/4. So either angle at A or angle at 0 is π/4. 

Let me consider that angle at A is π/4. Then, in triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2, with angle at A being π/4. So the sides would be:

Opposite angle at A: side opposite is 0-2.

Adjacent to angle at A: side from A to 2.

Hypotenuse: from 0 to A.

Wait, in a right triangle, the hypotenuse is opposite the right angle. Since the right angle is at 2, the hypotenuse would be AO (from A to O), assuming O is the origin. Wait, no. The vertices are A, 2, and 0. The right angle is at 2. So the hypotenuse is AO, and the legs are A-2 and 2-0. 

Then, angle at A is π/4. So tan(angle at A) = opposite over adjacent. Opposite side to angle at A is the length of segment 2-0, and adjacent is length of segment A-2. 

So tan(π/4) = |2-0| / |A-2|. Since tan(π/4)=1, so |2-0| / |A-2|=1 → |2-0|=|A-2|. 

Also, since point A lies on the unit circle, and point 0 is the center (since line 0-A is a radius), then the distance from 0 to A is 1. 

Additionally, point 2 lies on the same line as points 0 and A? Not sure yet. 

But let's denote coordinates. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier. Assume that the center of the circle is at point 0, which is (0,0). Let me define coordinates for point A as (x,y), lying on the unit circle, so x² + y² = 1. 

Now, point 2 is somewhere else. The line segments A-2 and 2-0 are perpendicular. So the slope of A-2 multiplied by the slope of 2-0 equals -1. 

But we need more relations. Also, in triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2, with angle at A being π/4. From earlier, |2-0| = |A-2|. 

Let me compute |2-0|: that's the distance from point 2 to the origin (0,0). Let’s denote point 2 as (p,q). Then |2-0| = sqrt(p² + q²).

And |A-2| is the distance from A to 2: sqrt((x-p)² + (y-q)²). 

From the earlier relation, sqrt(p² + q²) = sqrt((x-p)² + (y-q)²). Squaring both sides:

p² + q² = (x-p)² + (y - q)².

Expanding the RHS: x² - 2xp + p² + y² - 2yq + q².

So:

p² + q² = x² - 2xp + p² + y² - 2yq + q².

Subtract p² + q² from both sides:

0 = x² - 2xp + y² - 2yq.

Rearranged:

2xp + 2yq = x² + y².

But since point A is on the unit circle, x² + y² = 1. So substituting:

2xp + 2yq = 1.

So equation (1): 2xp + 2yq = 1.

Also, since line segments A-2 and 2-0 are perpendicular. The vector from 2 to A is (x - p, y - q), and the vector from 2 to 0 is (-p, -q). Their dot product should be zero:

(x - p)(-p) + (y - q)(-q) = 0.

Which simplifies to:

-p(x - p) - q(y - q) = 0

=> -px + p² - qy + q² = 0

=> p² + q² - px - qy = 0.

But p² + q² is the square of the distance from point 2 to origin, which we don't know yet. Let me call that d² = p² + q². So:

d² - px - qy = 0 => px + qy = d².

But from equation (1): 2xp + 2yq = 1 ⇒ xp + yq = 1/2.

So combining with px + qy = d²:

From equation (1): xp + yq = 1/2.

From the perpendicularity condition: px + qy = d². Therefore:

d² = 1/2.

Thus, the distance from point 2 to origin is sqrt(1/2) = (√2)/2 ≈ 0.7071.

So point 2 lies on a circle of radius √2/2 centered at the origin. 

But we still need more constraints. How to proceed? Perhaps considering the triangle's angles. We know that in triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2, with angle at A being π/4. 

Using trigonometry, in triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2, angle at A is π/4. So the ratio of the sides opposite and adjacent to angle at A is tan(π/4) = 1. 

As before, the side opposite angle at A is the length from 2 to 0, which is d = √(p² + q²) = √(1/2). The side adjacent to angle at A is the length from A to 2, which is sqrt[(x-p)^2 + (y - q)^2]. Earlier, we found that this equals d. 

So the tangent of angle at A is (opposite)/(adjacent) = d/d = 1, which matches tan(π/4) = 1. So this checks out. 

But how to find coordinates of A? We need more equations. 

We know that point A lies on the unit circle: x² + y² = 1.

Also, from the previous results, we have:

xp + yq = 1/2.

But we don't know the coordinates of point 2 (p, q). However, since point 2 lies on the circle of radius √(1/2), which is smaller than the unit circle. 

But maybe there's another relationship. Let me think. Since triangle A-2-0 is right-angled at 2, and angle at A is π/4, then the triangle has legs of length d and d, since tan(π/4)=1. Wait, no—the legs are the sides adjacent to the right angle. Wait, in triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2, the legs are A-2 and 2-0. So their lengths are equal because tan(π/4) = opposite/adjacent = length of 2-0 / length of A-2 = 1. Hence, they are equal. Therefore, length of A-2 equals length of 2-0, which we already found to be √(1/2). 

So length of A-2 = √(1/2). Also, since point A is on the unit circle, and point 2 is at distance √(1/2) from the origin. 

But how to relate this? Let's consider the distance between A and 2. Using coordinates:

Distance squared between A and 2 is (x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = (distance from A to 2)^2 = (sqrt(1/2))^2 = 1/2.

But expanding this:

(x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = x² - 2xp + p² + y² - 2yq + q² = (x² + y²) + (p² + q²) - 2(xp + yq) = 1 + (1/2) - 2*(1/2) = 1 + 1/2 - 1 = 1/2. Which confirms the calculation. 

But this doesn't give new info. So we need another constraint to find coordinates of A. 

Perhaps we need to use the fact that point 2 lies on certain lines. Looking back at the predicates, there's a Line(3,4), and PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(3,4)), PointLiesOnLine(0,Line(3,4)), and PointLiesOnLine(2,Line(3,4)). So points A, 0, and 2 all lie on the same line, Line(3,4). 

Ah! This is crucial. All three points A, 0, and 2 are colinear, lying on Line(3,4). Therefore, points A, 0, and 2 are on the same straight line. 

So the line Line(3,4) contains points A, 0, and 2. Given that 0 is the center of the circle (origin), and point A is on the circle. Let me visualize this: points A, 0, and 2 are aligned along line Line(3,4). 

Since 0 is the origin, and A is on the unit circle, then point 2 must be on the line extending from the origin through A. Because points A, 0, and 2 are colinear. 

Wait, if points A, 0, and 2 are colinear, then point 2 lies on the line passing through A and 0. So point 2 is somewhere along the line OA extended. 

Given that, let's parametrize this line. Let me assume that line Line(3,4) is the line passing through points A and 0. Let me denote this line as l. Points A, 0, and 2 are on line l. 

Since point 0 is the origin, and point A is on the unit circle, then the line l passes through the origin and point A. Point 2 is another point on line l. 

Earlier, we had that the distance from point 2 to the origin is √(1/2). So depending on whether point 2 is between 0 and A, or beyond A, it would affect the coordinates. 

Let me think about the coordinates. Let me suppose that point A is at (cosθ, sinθ), since it's on the unit circle. Then line l is the line passing through the origin and A, so parametrically, it can be represented as t*(cosθ, sinθ), where t is a scalar parameter. 

Point 0 is at t=0, point A is at t=1. Point 2 is another point on this line, so its coordinates are t*(cosθ, sinθ) for some t. 

We previously found that the distance from point 2 to the origin is √(1/2). So ||t*(cosθ, sinθ)|| = |t|*|| (cosθ, sinθ) || = |t|*1 = |t| = √(1/2). Therefore, t = ±√(1/2). 

So point 2 is located at t = √(1/2) or t = -√(1/2) along the line l. 

But since the triangle has vertices at A, 2, and 0, right-angled at 2. Let me consider both cases:

Case 1: t = √(1/2). Then point 2 is between the origin and point A. 

Case 2: t = -√(1/2). Then point 2 is on the opposite side of the origin from A. 

Let me analyze both cases. 

In Case 1: point 2 is between O and A. Then, the distance from O to 2 is √(1/2), and from 2 to A is 1 - √(1/2). But earlier, we had that in triangle A-2-O, the legs are O-2 and A-2, which have lengths √(1/2) and (1 - √(1/2))? Wait, but earlier we had that the lengths of O-2 and A-2 are equal. Wait, no—wait earlier, we derived that the lengths of O-2 and A-2 are equal because tan(angle at A) = 1. Wait, but in this case, if point 2 is between O and A, then O-2 is length √(1/2), and A-2 is length (OA - O-2) = 1 - √(1/2). These are unequal unless √(1/2) = 1 - √(1/2), which would imply 2√(1/2) = 1 → √2 = 1, which is false. So this contradicts our earlier conclusion that O-2 and A-2 are equal in length. Hence, Case 1 is invalid. 

Therefore, Case 2 must hold: point 2 is on the extension of OA beyond the origin, at distance √(1/2) from the origin. So the coordinates of point 2 are t*(cosθ, sinθ) with t = -√(1/2). Hence, coordinates of point 2 are (-√(1/2)*cosθ, -√(1/2)*sinθ). 

Now, in this case, the distance from O to 2 is √(1/2), and the distance from A to 2 is OA + O-2 = 1 + √(1/2). Wait, but earlier we said that the lengths of O-2 and A-2 are equal. Wait, no—earlier, we concluded that in triangle A-2-O, right-angled at 2, the legs O-2 and A-2 are equal because tan(angle at A) = 1. But in this scenario, O-2 is √(1/2) and A-2 is 1 + √(1/2), which aren't equal. Contradiction again. What's wrong here?

Wait, earlier derivation showed that in triangle A-2-O, right-angled at 2, the legs are O-2 and A-2, and tan(angle at A) = (O-2 length)/(A-2 length) = 1. Hence, O-2 length = A-2 length. So O-2 = A-2. 

But O-2 length is √(1/2), and A-2 length is |OA - O-2| if they're colinear. Wait, if point 2 is on the line extending beyond O from A, then OA is from O to A (length 1), and O-2 is from O to 2 (length √(1/2)), and A-2 is from A to 2. Depending on direction, this could be OA + O-2 or something else. 

Actually, if point 2 is on the line extending through O from A, then the distance from A to 2 is |AO + O-2|. Since O is between A and 2. So A-2 = AO + O-2 = 1 + √(1/2). But according to tan(angle at A) = O-2 / A-2 = 1, which would mean O-2 = A-2. But O-2 is √(1/2), and A-2 is 1 + √(1/2), which are not equal. Contradiction again. 

Hmm, there's a mistake here. Where did I go wrong?

Going back to the earlier derivation, we had that in triangle A-2-O, right-angled at 2, angle at A is π/4. So tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent = (length of O-2) / (length of A-2) = 1. So O-2 = A-2. Therefore, length of O-2 equals length of A-2. 

But in this scenario, O-2 is √(1/2), and A-2 is |A-2|. But if point 2 is on the line extending through O from A, then A-2 = AO + O-2 = 1 + √(1/2). But that would make O-2 ≠ A-2. Hence contradiction. Therefore, my assumption that point 2 is on the line extending beyond O from A is incorrect. 

Wait, maybe point 2 is on the line OA but on the other side of A, so that O-2 = OA + A-2? Let me clarify. If point 2 is on line OA extended beyond A, then the distance from O to 2 is OA + A-2. Wait, no: O to A is 1, and A to 2 is some length. So O to 2 is O to A plus A to 2. So O-2 = 1 + length of A-2. 

But from earlier, O-2 = A-2. So 1 + length of A-2 = length of A-2 → 1 = 0, which is impossible. 

Wait, this suggests there's a flaw in my earlier logic. Let me revisit the trigonometric relationship. 

In triangle A-2-O, right-angled at 2, angle at A is π/4. So the sides are:

- Hypotenuse: AO = 1 (since it's the distance from A to O).
- Legs: O-2 and A-2. 
- Angle at A: π/4. 

By definition, in a right triangle, the sine of angle at A is opposite over hypotenuse. 

Wait, let me draw this mentally. At angle A, the sides are: 

- Opposite side: the side opposite angle A, which is the segment from O to 2 (length O-2).
- Adjacent side: the segment from A to 2 (length A-2).
- Hypotenuse: segment from O to A (length 1).

So, sin(angle at A) = opposite / hypotenuse = (O-2) / 1 = O-2.

Similarly, cos(angle at A) = adjacent / hypotenuse = (A-2) / 1 = A-2.

Since angle at A is π/4, sin(π/4) = √2/2 = O-2, and cos(π/4) = √2/2 = A-2. 

Therefore, O-2 = √2/2, and A-2 = √2/2. 

So the distance from O to 2 is √2/2, and the distance from A to 2 is √2/2. 

This means that point 2 is located such that it is √2/2 away from O and √2/2 away from A. 

But since points A, O, and 2 are colinear, this implies that O is between A and 2, or A is between O and 2. 

Let me consider both scenarios:

Scenario 1: O is between A and 2. Then, OA = 1, O-2 = √2/2, so A-2 = OA + O-2 = 1 + √2/2 ≈ 1.707. But we also have A-2 = √2/2 ≈ 0.707. Contradiction.

Scenario 2: A is between O and 2. Then, O-2 = OA + A-2 = 1 + A-2. But we have O-2 = √2/2, so 1 + A-2 = √2/2 → A-2 = √2/2 - 1 ≈ -0.292. Negative length? No, distance can't be negative. So this implies that A is between O and 2, but A-2 is positive, so √2/2 - 1 is negative. Contradiction again. 

Wait, this suggests that there's an inconsistency. How is this possible? Did I misapply the trigonometric ratios?

Wait, in the triangle, the angle at A is π/4. Let me double-check the definitions. 

In triangle A-2-O, right-angled at 2. So the right angle is at 2. The angle at A is π/4. The sides are:

- Opposite angle at A: segment from 2 to O (length O-2).
- Adjacent to angle at A: segment from 2 to A (length A-2).
- Hypotenuse: segment from O to A (length 1).

So tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent = (O-2) / (A-2) = 1. 

So O-2 = A-2. 

Also, by the Pythagorean theorem: (O-2)^2 + (A-2)^2 = (OA)^2. 

Since O-2 = A-2, this becomes 2*(O-2)^2 = 1 → (O-2)^2 = 1/2 → O-2 = √(1/2) = √2/2. 

So O-2 = √2/2, and A-2 = √2/2. 

But since points A, O, and 2 are collinear, the distance from O to 2 is √2/2, and the distance from A to 2 is √2/2. 

So the total distance from A to O is OA = 1. Let's consider the positions:

If O is between A and 2, then OA + O-2 = A-2 → 1 + √2/2 = √2/2 → 1 = 0, which is impossible.

If A is between O and 2, then O-2 = OA + A-2 → √2/2 = 1 + √2/2 → 0 = 1, which is also impossible.

If 2 is between O and A, then O-2 + A-2 = OA → √2/2 + √2/2 = 1 → √2 = 1 → contradiction.

Wait, this suggests there is no such point 2 on the line OA such that O-2 = A-2 = √2/2 and OA = 1. This is a contradiction. What went wrong?

Maybe my initial assumption about the angle at A being π/4 is wrong? Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says: "forms a red right triangle with an angle of π/4." It doesn't specify which angle is π/4. The triangle is right-angled, so one angle is π/2, and another is π/4. The third angle is π/2 - π/4 = π/4. So it's a 45-45-90 triangle. Hence, the two legs are equal. 

In the triangle A-2-O, right-angled at 2, with angle at A being π/4, then the legs O-2 and A-2 must be equal. But as shown, this leads to a contradiction. 

Alternatively, maybe the angle at 0 is π/4? Let's try that. If the right angle is at 2, and the angle at 0 is π/4. Let's see.

In triangle A-2-O, right-angled at 2. The angle at 0 is π/4. So tan(angle at 0) = opposite / adjacent = (A-2) / (O-2) = 1. So A-2 = O-2. Again leading to the same contradiction. 

Wait, this suggests that there's an error in the problem setup, or in my understanding. Let me revisit the original predicates to ensure I haven't misread anything.

The problem states: "Point A is on the following unit circle with radius 1, and forms a red right triangle with an angle of π/4."

It might be that the triangle isn't necessarily having the right angle at 2. Maybe the right angle is at A or at O. Let me explore this.

Suppose the right angle is at A. Then, the triangle has vertices at A, B, and C, with right angle at A. One of the angles is π/4, so the other acute angle is π/4 as well, making it an isoceles right triangle. 

But how does this relate to the unit circle? Point A is on the unit circle, and the triangle includes point A. 

Alternatively, maybe the triangle has vertices at A, B, and the origin, with the right angle at B. Let's try this.

Let me assume the right angle is at B. So triangle A-B-O, right-angled at B. One of the angles is π/4, say at A. Then, similar to before, tan(angle at A) = opposite / adjacent = BO / BA = 1, so BO = BA. 

But point A is on the unit circle, and B is some point. Let me assume B is on the line OA, as per the earlier predicate that points A, 0, and 2 are on the same line. Wait, the predicate says PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(3,4)), PointLiesOnLine(0,Line(3,4)), and PointLiesOnLine(2,Line(3,4)). So points A, 0, and 2 are on the same line, Line(3,4). 

If the right angle is at B (which is point 2), then the triangle is A-2-O, right-angled at 2. As before, but with the angle at A being π/4. 

But this brings us back to the earlier contradiction. 

Wait, but maybe the triangle is not A-2-O, but another combination. Let me check the predicates again. 

The predicate Right(Triangle(1)) and RightAngle(Angle(2)) suggest that there is a right angle at Angle(2), which is likely the angle at point 2. And Perpendicular(Line(A,2), Line(2,0)) confirms that the lines A-2 and 2-0 are perpendicular, hence the right angle at 2. 

So the triangle must be A-2-0, right-angled at 2. 

But earlier calculations show that this leads to a contradiction, implying there's an error in assumptions. 

Wait, let's re-examine the condition that the triangle has an angle of π/4. Maybe it's not the angle at A, but at 0. Let's try that. 

In triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2. If the angle at 0 is π/4, then tan(angle at 0) = opposite / adjacent = (A-2) / (O-2) = 1. So A-2 = O-2. 

Again, this leads to the same problem. 

Wait, but maybe the triangle is not right-angled at 2, but at another point? Let me recheck the predicates. 

The predicate RightAngle(Angle(2)) and Perpendicular(Line(A,2), Line(2,0)) indicate that the right angle is at 2, as the two lines meeting at 2 are perpendicular. 

So the right angle is at 2. 

At this point, I'm stuck. My calculations keep leading to contradictions, suggesting either a miscalculation or a misunderstanding. Let me try a different approach. 

Let me recall that point A is on the unit circle, so its coordinates are (cosθ, sinθ). Let me assume θ is such that the triangle conditions are satisfied. 

Since points A, 0, and 2 are colinear, let me represent point 2 as k*A, where k is a scalar. Because it's on the line through A and 0. 

So point 2 = k*(cosθ, sinθ). 

The distance from 0 to 2 is |k| * 1 = |k|. 

The distance from A to 2 is |k - 1| * 1 = |k - 1|.

Since the triangle A-2-0 is right-angled at 2, and has an angle of π/4 at A or at 0. 

Let's assume the angle at A is π/4. Then, using the law of sines or cosines. 

In triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2. Let me denote the sides:

- AB: from A to 2, length |k - 1|
- BC: from 2 to 0, length |k|
- AC: from A to 0, length 1

Wait, no. The sides are:

- Between A and 2: length |k - 1|
- Between 2 and 0: length |k|
- Between A and 0: length 1

Since it's a right triangle at 2, by Pythagoras:

(|k - 1|)^2 + (|k|)^2 = (1)^2.

Expand: (k - 1)^2 + k² = 1.

Assuming k is positive (since point 2 is on the line through A and 0, possibly extending in either direction). Let's drop absolute values by assuming k > 0.

So (k - 1)^2 + k² = 1.

Expand: k² - 2k + 1 + k² = 1 → 2k² - 2k + 1 = 1 → 2k² - 2k = 0 → 2k(k - 1) = 0 → k = 0 or k = 1. 

But k=0 would place point 2 at the origin, which is point 0, making the triangle degenerate. k=1 places point 2 at A, also degenerate. So no solution. 

This suggests that there's no such point 2 on the line through A and 0, except for degenerate cases. This indicates a fundamental issue with the problem setup or my interpretation. 

Wait, but the problem states that such a point exists. So I must have made a mistake. Let me reconsider the angle. Maybe the angle of π/4 is at the origin, not at A. 

Let me try that. In triangle A-2-0, right-angled at 2, angle at 0 is π/4. 

Using the same setup, with point 2 = k*A. 

In this case, the angle at 0 is π/4. Let's use the law of tangents or slopes. 

The angle at 0 is between segments 0-2 and 0-A. Since 0-2 is from 0 to 2 (vector k*A), and 0-A is vector A. 

The angle between vectors 0-2 and 0-A is π/4. 

The cosine of this angle is the dot product of vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. 

Vector 0-2 is k*A, vector 0-A is A. 

Dot product: (k*A) · A = k * |A|² = k * 1 = k. 

Magnitude of 0-2 is |k| * |A| = |k|. Magnitude of 0-A is 1. 

So cos(angle at 0) = k / (|k| * 1) = sign(k). 

Since the angle is π/4, cos(π/4) = √2/2. So sign(k) = √2/2. Since k is a scalar, and we assumed k > 0, then k = √2/2. 

So point 2 is at k*A = (√2/2) * (cosθ, sinθ). 

Now, the triangle is right-angled at 2, so by Pythagoras:

Length of 0-2 squared + Length of A-2 squared = Length of 0-A squared.

Length of 0-2 is k = √2/2.

Length of A-2 is |A - 2| = |A - k*A| = |1 - k| * |A| = |1 - k|.

Length of 0-A is 1.

So:

(√2/2)^2 + (1 - √2/2)^2 = 1^2 ?

Calculate left side:

(2/4) + (1 - √2/2)^2 = 1/2 + [1 - √2 + ( (√2)/2 )^2 ] = 1/2 + [1 - √2 + (2/4)] = 1/2 + 1 - √2 + 1/2 = 1 + 1 - √2 = 2 - √2 ≈ 2 - 1.414 ≈ 0.586, which is not equal to 1. Hence, this doesn't satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. 

Contradiction again. 

What if the angle at 0 is π/4, and the right angle is at 2, but the triangle isn't formed by points A, 2, and 0? But the predicates say that the triangle is formed with point A, and the right angle is at 2. 

I must be missing something. Let me return to the initial premises. The problem says that the triangle is red, and the angle is π/4. Perhaps the triangle is not formed by points A, 0, and 2, but by other points? Or maybe the right angle is at A? 

Let me try assuming the right angle is at A. So triangle is A-0-B, right-angled at A. One of the angles is π/4, so the other angle is π/4, making it an isoceles right triangle. 

In this case, the legs are AA-0 and AA-B. Wait, no: the right angle is at A, so the legs are from A to 0 and from A to B. 

Since point A is on the unit circle, and 0 is the origin, the distance from A to 0 is 1. If the triangle is isoceles right-angled at A, then the legs are equal, so the distance from A to 0 equals the distance from A to B. 

So |A-0| = |A-B| = 1. 

Thus, point B is such that it is at distance 1 from A. Also, the angle at A is π/4, but wait, if it's a right triangle with legs of equal length, then the angles at 0 and B are both π/4. 

But how does this relate to the unit circle? Point B could be anywhere, but the problem doesn't mention it. 

However, the problem states that the triangle is formed with point A, and the angle is π/4. This might be possible, but without additional information about point B, it's hard to determine the coordinates of A. 

But the problem specifies that the triangle is formed with an angle of π/4, and point A is on the unit circle. Maybe the triangle is such that one leg is the radius (from 0 to A), and the other leg is from A to some point B, making a right angle at A, and the angle
