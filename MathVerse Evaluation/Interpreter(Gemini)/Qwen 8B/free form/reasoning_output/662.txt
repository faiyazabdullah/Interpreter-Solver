QUESTION:
Consider the solid pictured and answer the following:

Hence what is the total surface area? The outer radius is 11 cm, inner radius is 10 cm and length 24 cm.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, the question is about finding the total surface area of a solid. The given information includes two circles with radii 11 cm and 10 cm, and the length between them is 24 cm. Hmm, I need to visualize this. 

First, the problem mentions an "outer radius" of 11 cm and an "inner radius" of 10 cm, with a length of 24 cm. That sounds like it's describing a cylindrical shape but with two different radii. Wait, maybe it's a hollow cylinder? Like a pipe or a tube. Because if you have an outer radius and an inner radius, that would make sense for something like a cylindrical shell. 

So, thinking about the total surface area of such a shape. For a hollow cylinder, the total surface area would include the areas of the two circular ends (the top and bottom), plus the lateral surfaces (the side). But wait, since there's an inner and outer radius, each end would have two circles: one outer and one inner. Or maybe just the areas between the two radii?

Wait, actually, no. Let me recall the formula for the surface area of a cylinder. For a regular cylinder (solid), the total surface area is 2πr² + 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height. But here, since it's a hollow cylinder, we need to adjust for the fact that there's an inner and outer radius. 

So, the total surface area would consist of three parts: 
1. The outer curved surface area.
2. The inner curved surface area.
3. The areas of the two annular (ring-shaped) bases.

Wait, but do we include the top and bottom? If it's a solid object with inner and outer radii, then yes, those two annular regions would be part of the surface area. 

Let me break it down. 

The outer curved surface area would be the circumference of the outer circle times the height (or length). Similarly, the inner curved surface area would be the circumference of the inner circle times the same height. Then, the two annular bases would each have an area equal to π(R² - r²), where R is the outer radius and r is the inner radius. Since there are two bases, multiply that by 2. 

So putting it all together, the total surface area should be:

Total SA = 2πR² - 2πr² + 2πR*h - 2πr*h ?

Wait, no. Wait, the outer curved surface area is 2πR*h, and the inner curved surface area is 2πr*h. Then the two annular bases are each π(R² - r²), so multiplied by 2. Therefore:

Total SA = 2πR*h + 2πr*h + 2*(πR² - πr²)

Wait, no. Wait, the annular bases are each πR² - πr², so two of them would be 2*(πR² - πr²). And then the curved surfaces are 2πR*h (outer) and 2πr*h (inner). So adding all together:

Total SA = 2πR*h + 2πr*h + 2π(R² - r²)

But wait, hold on. Alternatively, sometimes people consider whether the ends are open or closed. If the object is like a pipe, it might not have the ends, but the problem says "total surface area," which usually includes all surfaces. However, let me check again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to a frustum of a cone? No, because the length is given as 24 cm, which would be the height of the frustum. But the radii are different at the two ends. Wait, but the problem says "the outer radius is 11 cm, inner radius is 10 cm and length 24 cm." Maybe it's a cylinder with two different radii, so the cross-section is a rectangle with two semicircular ends? Wait, no. If it's a cylinder with inner and outer radius, then it's more like a cylindrical shell. So, the total surface area would be the sum of the outer curved surface, inner curved surface, and the two annular ends.

Alternatively, if it's a solid cylinder with a hole drilled through it, making the inner radius 10 cm and outer radius 11 cm. In that case, the surface area would include the outer curved surface, the inner curved surface, and the two annular ends. 

So let me confirm the formula. Let's think of it as two cylinders: the outer one with radius R and the inner one with radius r, both with the same height h. The total surface area would be the sum of the outer surface area, inner surface area, and the two annular ends. 

But when you have a hollow cylinder, the surface area is often considered as the outer curved surface plus the inner curved surface plus the two annular ends. However, in some contexts, the term "surface area" might exclude the ends, but the question says "total surface area," which typically includes all surfaces. 

Therefore, proceeding with that assumption. 

Given that, let's compute each component. 

First, outer radius R = 11 cm, inner radius r = 10 cm, length h = 24 cm.

Outer curved surface area: 2πR*h = 2π*11*24

Inner curved surface area: 2πr*h = 2π*10*24

Annular ends: Each end has an area of π(R² - r²). There are two ends, so 2π(R² - r²).

Adding all these up:

Total SA = 2πR*h + 2πr*h + 2π(R² - r²)

Let me factor terms:

Total SA = 2πh(R + r) + 2π(R² - r²)

Alternatively, maybe simplifying further. Let me plug in the numbers.

Compute each term separately.

First, compute 2πR*h:

2π*11*24. Let me calculate that.

Similarly, 2π*10*24.

Then, 2π(R² - r²) = 2π(11² - 10²) = 2π(121 - 100) = 2π(21) = 42π.

Now, let me compute the first two terms:

For outer curved surface area: 2π*11*24 = 2π*264 = 528π

Inner curved surface area: 2π*10*24 = 2π*240 = 480π

Adding those gives 528π + 480π = 1008π

Then add the annular ends: 42π

Total SA = 1008π + 42π = 1050π

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me check again if that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to look at it: the total surface area is the same as the surface area of the larger cylinder minus the surface area of the smaller cylinder, but considering that when you subtract, you remove the inner surfaces. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

If you imagine the larger cylinder (radius 11 cm) with height 24 cm. Its surface area is 2πR² + 2πRh. But if you drill a hole of radius 10 cm through it, the resulting surface area would be the outer surface area of the large cylinder (which is 2πRh) plus the inner surface area of the small cylinder (2πrh) plus the area of the two annular rings (each being πR² - πr²). Wait, but if you take the original big cylinder, its surface area includes the two circular ends. But when you drill the hole, you remove the material inside, so the original two ends become annular rings. However, the original surface area of the big cylinder would be 2πR² + 2πRh. But after drilling, the new surface area would be the outer curved surface (2πRh) plus the inner curved surface (2πrh) plus the two annular ends (each πR² - πr²). Wait, but the original two ends were πR² each. After drilling, they become πR² - πr² each. So the total surface area would be:

Original outer curved surface (2πRh) + inner curved surface (2πrh) + 2*(πR² - πr²). Which is the same as before. So that gives us:

Total SA = 2πRh + 2πrh + 2π(R² - r²)

Which is the same as earlier. So substituting the numbers:

2π*11*24 + 2π*10*24 + 2π*(11² -10²) = 528π + 480π + 42π = 1050π cm²

So converting that to numerical value, since π ≈ 3.14159265...

Calculating 1050 * π ≈ 1050 * 3.14159265 ≈ ?

Well, 1000π ≈ 3141.59265, 50π ≈ 157.07963. Adding together gives 3141.59265 + 157.07963 ≈ 3298.67228 cm².

But let me verify that calculation again. Let me compute 1050 × π numerically.

Alternatively, using calculator-like steps:

π ≈ 3.1415926535

So 1050 × π ≈ 1050 × 3.1415926535

Breaking it down:

First, 1000 × π = 3141.5926535

Then 50 × π ≈ 157.079632679

Add them: 3141.5926535 + 157.079632679 ≈ 3298.672286... cm².

So approximately 3298.67 cm² when rounded to two decimal places. But let me check if there's any mistake here.

Wait, but let me check if the formula was correct. Another thought: when calculating the surface area, does the formula include the two annular ends? Suppose the solid is like a pipe, open at both ends. Then the surface area would be the outer curved surface plus inner curved surface, without the ends. But the problem says "total surface area", which could imply including all surfaces, including the ends. However, in standard terminology, for example, the surface area of a cylinder includes the top and bottom. But if it's a hollow cylinder, sometimes people refer to the lateral surface area excluding the ends. But the problem states "total surface area", so likely including all surfaces.

But let me check again. If the solid is a cylinder with inner and outer radii, then the total surface area would indeed include the outer curved surface, inner curved surface, and the two annular ends. Hence our previous calculation of 1050π cm² ≈ 3298.67 cm².

However, let me check once more for errors. Let's re-express the formula:

Total SA = 2πR² + 2πRh - 2πr² + 2πrh ?

No, that would be incorrect. Wait, if you think of the entire structure as a combination of two cylinders: the outer one and the inner one. But the inner cylinder is removed. So the total surface area would be the outer surface area of the big cylinder (including the two circular ends) plus the inner surface area of the small cylinder (but without the ends, since they are internal). Wait, no—if the original big cylinder had its ends, but when you drill the hole, those ends become annular. So the total surface area would be:

Original outer surface area (including ends): 2πR² + 2πRh

Minus the area of the holes (which are the inner circles) but also adding the inner surface area. Wait, this seems complicated. Let me think differently.

Imagine creating the hollow cylinder by taking a solid cylinder of radius R and height h, then drilling a hole of radius r through it. The volume would be π(R² - r²)h. But the surface area would be the outer surface area of the big cylinder (excluding the ends, because when you drill the hole, you remove the material from the ends?), no—actually, no. The ends are still present, but they are now annular. So the total surface area would be:

Outer curved surface area (2πR h) + inner curved surface area (2πr h) + the area of the two annular ends (each πR² - πr²). Thus, the same as before. So the formula is correct.

Thus, the total SA is 1050π cm², which is approximately 3298.67 cm².

But let me check with another approach. Let me compute each term individually.

First, outer curved surface area: 2πR h = 2 * π * 11 * 24 = 528π

Inner curved surface area: 2πr h = 2 * π * 10 * 24 = 480π

Annular ends: 2 * π(R² - r²) = 2π(121 - 100) = 2π(21) = 42π

Total SA = 528π + 480π + 42π = 1050π cm²

Yes, that's correct. Now, converting 1050π to decimal:

Using π ≈ 3.1415926535,

1050 × π ≈ 1050 × 3.1415926535 ≈ ?

Let me compute 1000 × π = 3141.5926535

Then 50 × π ≈ 157.079632679

Summing: 3141.5926535 + 157.079632679 = 3298.672286... cm²

Rounded to two decimal places, that's 3298.67 cm².

Wait, but let me confirm the exactness of this number. Let me compute 1050 × π with higher precision.

Alternatively, using a calculator, π ≈ 3.141592653589793

So 1050 × π ≈ 1050 × 3.141592653589793

Let me compute 1000 × π = 3141.592653589793

Then 50 × π = 157.07963267948966

Adding them: 3141.592653589793 + 157.07963267948966 = 3298.6722862692826 cm²

So rounding to two decimal places: 3298.67 cm².

Therefore, the total surface area is approximately 3298.67 cm².

But let me check again if the formula is correct. Suppose the solid is a cylinder with outer radius 11 and inner radius 10, length 24. Is there another interpretation?

Another possibility: Could it be a truncated cone? But the problem mentions length 24 cm, which would be the slant height? Not sure. But given the mention of radii, probably a cylinder. Also, the given data matches with the cylinder model.

Alternatively, if someone misreads the problem as a sphere, but no—the length is 24 cm, which would be diameter in a sphere, but the radii are given as 11 and 10, which don't match. So definitely a cylinder.

Therefore, my conclusion is that the total surface area is 1050π cm² ≈ 3298.67 cm².

But let me check once again for calculation mistakes. For instance, did I miscalculate the annular ends?

The annular ends: each end is a ring with outer radius 11 and inner radius 10. The area of one end is π(11² - 10²) = π(121 - 100) = 21π. Two ends: 42π. Correct.

Curved surfaces: outer 2π*11*24 = 528π, inner 2π*10*24=480π. Total 1008π. Add 42π → 1050π. Correct.

Yes, so 1050π cm². Rounded to two decimal places, that's approximately 3298.67 cm².

Hence, the answer should be 3298.67 cm².
