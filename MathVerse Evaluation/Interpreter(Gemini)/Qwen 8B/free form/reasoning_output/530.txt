QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the midline equation of the function?

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the midline equation of the trigonometric function given the maximum and minimum points. 

First, I remember that for a trigonometric function like sine or cosine, the midline is the horizontal line halfway between the maximum and minimum values. So if I can find the average of the y-coordinates of the maximum and minimum points, that should give me the y-value for the midline. 

Looking at the given points, the maximum is at (π/4, -2.2) and the minimum is at (3π/4, -8.5). Wait, hold on—usually, the maximum would have the higher y-value and the minimum the lower one. But here, both y-values are negative. Let me check the numbers again. The maximum point's y-coordinate is -2.2 and the minimum's is -8.5. Since -2.2 is greater than -8.5, that makes sense because it's the maximum. 

So, to find the midline, I need to compute the average of these two y-values. The formula for the midline is (max_y + min_y)/2. Plugging in the numbers: (-2.2 + (-8.5))/2. Let me calculate that. 

Adding -2.2 and -8.5 gives me -10.7. Then dividing by 2, that's -5.35. Therefore, the midline is the horizontal line y = -5.35. 

Wait, but maybe there's more to it? Like, does the midline depend on anything else? For example, sometimes functions can have vertical shifts, but since we're dealing with a standard trigonometric function, the midline is just the average of max and min. Yeah, I think that's correct. 

Let me double-check my calculation. -2.2 plus -8.5 equals... yes, that's -10.7. Divided by 2 is indeed -5.35. So the midline equation is y = -5.35. 

But wait, the problem mentions the graph of a trigonometric function. Could there be any other factors? For instance, if the function was transformed vertically, but the midline is determined solely by the max and min. So regardless of amplitude or period, the midline is always halfway between them. 

Therefore, I think my answer is correct. The midline is y equals the average of the maximum and minimum y-values, which is -5.35. 

Hmm, but maybe they want it expressed as a fraction instead of a decimal? Let me see. The original coordinates had decimals, but perhaps converting -5.35 to a fraction. Let's see: 0.35 is 7/20, so -5.35 is -5 - 7/20, which is -107/20. But maybe they prefer decimal form. The problem didn't specify, but the given points have decimals, so probably acceptable to leave it as -5.35. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to represent it using π? Wait, no, the midline is a horizontal line, so its equation is simply y equals some constant. The x-values of the max and min don't affect the midline's equation. So yeah, the answer is y = -5.35. 

I think that's it. No mistakes in the logic. Midline is halfway between max and min. Calculated correctly. Final answer should be y = -5.35.
