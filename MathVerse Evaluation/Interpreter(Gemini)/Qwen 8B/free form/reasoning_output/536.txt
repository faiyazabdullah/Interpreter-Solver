QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the amplitude of a trigonometric function given its minimum and maximum points. Let me recall what I know about trigonometric functions and their graphs.

First, the amplitude of a trigonometric function like sine or cosine is the distance from the midline of the graph to its maximum or minimum point. It's half the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the function. Wait, yes, that sounds right. So if I have the maximum and minimum y-values, subtract them, divide by two, and that should give me the amplitude.

Looking at the problem, they mention the minimum point is at (-π/2, 2.4) and the maximum is at (3π/2, 13). Wait, hold on, the x-coordinates here are in terms of π. But does that matter? Well, the amplitude is related to the vertical stretch of the function, so maybe the horizontal positions aren't directly affecting it. Hmm. Let me think again.

The amplitude is purely about how far the function goes up and down from its midline. So regardless of where the maxima and minima occur horizontally, the amplitude depends on the vertical difference. So even though the x-values here are different, the amplitude calculation would just involve the y-values.

So let me check the given points. The minimum y-value is 2.4, and the maximum y-value is 13. Therefore, the difference between these two is 13 - 2.4 = 10.6. Then, dividing that by 2 gives the amplitude. Let me compute that: 10.6 divided by 2 is 5.3. So the amplitude should be 5.3.

Wait, but wait a second. Is there anything else I need to consider? Like phase shifts or vertical shifts? Because the amplitude is not affected by those. Amplitude is just the vertical stretch factor. The midline would be the average of the maximum and minimum values. So the midline here would be (13 + 2.4)/2 = 15.4 / 2 = 7.7. But since the question is only asking for amplitude, which is the distance from midline to max or min, that's indeed half the difference between max and min. So yeah, 13 - 2.4 = 10.6, divide by 2 is 5.3. 

But wait, let me make sure that there isn't a trick here. Sometimes problems might refer to the amplitude differently, but no, standard definition is that. Also, the fact that the points are given with x-values involving π—like -π/2 and 3π/2—is that significant? For example, if the function were something like sin(x) or cos(x), the maxima and minima occur at certain intervals, but since we're told it's a general trigonometric function, perhaps shifted or scaled, the amplitude is still determined by the vertical difference. So the x-values don't affect the amplitude. 

Therefore, my conclusion is that the amplitude is (13 - 2.4)/2 = 5.3. Converting that to a fraction or decimal? Well, 10.6 divided by 2 is 5.3. Since the original values are given with decimals, probably acceptable to present as 5.3. Alternatively, maybe express as a fraction. Let me check the numbers again. 13 is a whole number, 2.4 is a decimal. Let me do exact calculation:

Maximum y: 13. Minimum y: 2.4. Difference: 13 - 2.4 = 10.6. Divided by 2: 5.3. Yes. So 5.3 is correct. 

Alternatively, converting 2.4 to fractions. 2.4 is 12/5. So 13 is 13/1. Difference is 13 - 12/5 = (65/5 - 12/5) = 53/5. Divide by 2: 53/10 = 5.3. Same result. So either way, 5.3. 

Thus, the amplitude is 5.3. Therefore, the answer should be 5.3. Let me confirm once more that there's no other interpretation. For instance, could the problem be referring to something else? Like, if the function was a sinusoid with some horizontal compression or stretching, but amplitude is independent of horizontal scaling. So no, the answer remains 5.3.

I think that's solid. No mistakes detected in the reasoning. So the final answer is 5.3.
