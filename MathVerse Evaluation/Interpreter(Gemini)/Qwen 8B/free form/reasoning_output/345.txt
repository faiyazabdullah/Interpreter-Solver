<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Luke sailed 116 kilometers on a bearing of 231 degrees. We need to find how far west he is from his starting point, which is denoted as 'w'. 

First, I need to recall what bearings mean. Bearings are measured clockwise from north. So a bearing of 231 degrees would start from the north direction and turn 231 degrees clockwise. Let me visualize this. If I imagine a compass, north is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, and west is 270 degrees. Wait, but 231 degrees is between 180 (south) and 270 (west). Specifically, 231 - 180 = 51 degrees past south towards west. So the direction is 51 degrees west of due south? Or maybe it's better to think in terms of standard position angles?

Wait, sometimes bearings are confused with standard angles. In mathematics, angles are typically measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (east direction). But bearings are different. Let me clarify. A bearing of 231 degrees means starting at north and rotating clockwise 231 degrees. So if we convert that to standard mathematical angle (from positive x-axis, counterclockwise), we need to adjust accordingly.

Let me think. North is 0 degrees in bearings. So, if we consider the standard coordinate system where the positive x-axis is east and positive y-axis is north, then a bearing of θ degrees corresponds to an angle of 90° - θ degrees in standard position, but adjusted for clockwise rotation. Wait, perhaps another way: if you have a bearing of θ, then the direction is θ degrees clockwise from north. To convert this to a standard angle (measured counterclockwise from east), we can subtract the bearing from 90 degrees? Hmm, no. Let me draw this mentally.

Imagine standing at the origin facing north. Turning clockwise by θ degrees. So, if θ is 0, you're facing north. If θ is 90, you face east. If θ is 180, you face south. If θ is 270, you face west. So, the direction vector would correspond to an angle of (90° - θ) in standard position? Wait, not quite. Because if θ is 0, the standard angle would be 90 degrees (pointing north). If θ is 90 degrees (bearing), then you face east, which is 0 degrees in standard position. So, there's a relationship here. The standard angle φ (counterclockwise from east) is equal to 90° - bearing. However, since bearings can go beyond 360°, but in our case, it's 231°, which is less than 360°.

So, for a bearing of 231°, the standard angle φ is 90° - 231° = -141°, but angles are periodic modulo 360°, so adding 360° gives us 219°. Therefore, the direction of travel is 219° in standard position. That is, 219° counterclockwise from the positive x-axis (east). Alternatively, 219° is equivalent to 180° + 39°, so pointing southwest, 39° below the negative x-axis (southwest direction).

But maybe there's another way to calculate the components. Since we need to find how far west he is from the starting point, which is essentially the horizontal component of his displacement. Wait, in standard coordinates, the x-axis is east-west, with positive x being east and negative x being west. The y-axis is north-south, positive y being north and negative y being south.

So, if he travels at a bearing of 231°, which is 231° clockwise from north, then his movement can be broken down into east-west and north-south components. Let me compute the trigonometric components. The total distance is 116 km. The angle relative to the north axis is 231°, so the direction is 231° clockwise from north. To find the east-west and north-south components, we can model this as follows:

The angle between his path and the north direction is 231°, but since bearings are measured clockwise, we can decompose this into sine and cosine components. Wait, actually, the displacement can be represented as a vector. Let me think about the components.

If we take the bearing as θ, then the angle from the north axis is θ. To get the eastward (x) and northward (y) components:

Eastward component (x): distance * sin(θ)

Northward component (y): distance * cos(θ)

Wait, because if θ is measured clockwise from north, then moving east would involve sine of θ, and moving north would involve cosine of θ. Let me verify with θ = 0°, which points directly north. Then East component is 0, North component is distance. Correct. If θ = 90°, pointing east. Then East component is distance * sin(90°)=distance*1, North component is distance*cos(90°)=0. Correct. Similarly, θ = 180°, pointing south. Then East component is sin(180°)*distance = 0, North component is cos(180°)*distance = -distance. Which makes sense, as it's pointing south. So yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, for θ = 231°, the East component is 116*sin(231°), and the North component is 116*cos(231°). But we need to find how far west he is, which is the absolute value of the East component, but since he's sailing west, the East component should be negative. Wait, let me check.

Wait, the East component is the projection along the east direction. If the angle is such that he's going southwest, then the East component would be negative (since he's moving west) and the North component would also be negative (since he's moving south). 

So, let's compute the East component:

East = 116 * sin(231°)

Similarly, North = 116 * cos(231°)

But we need to find the westward distance, which is the magnitude of the East component (since West is negative East). So, w = |East| = |116 * sin(231°)|.

Alternatively, since he's moving west, the East component is negative, so w = -East component.

But first, let me compute sin(231°). Let me recall that 231° is in the third quadrant (between 180° and 270°). The reference angle is 231° - 180° = 51°. So, sin(231°) = -sin(51°), because in the third quadrant, sine is negative. Similarly, cos(231°) = -cos(51°). 

Therefore, East component = 116 * (-sin(51°)), so w = 116 * sin(51°). Wait, because the East component is negative, so the westward distance is the absolute value, so w = 116 * sin(51°). Let me confirm this.

Yes, because if the angle is 231°, the East component is negative, so the westward distance is the magnitude of that component. Hence, w = 116 * sin(51°). Let me compute that value.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me double-check the formula. The East component is calculated as distance * sin(bearing). But bearing is measured clockwise from north, so depending on the angle, the components may vary. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach.

Another way: Let's consider the bearing as 231°, which is 231° clockwise from north. This places him in the southwest direction. The angle between his path and the south direction is 231° - 180° = 51°, so he is 51° west of due south. Therefore, the westward component would be opposite side of the right triangle formed with hypotenuse 116 km, angle 51°, adjacent to the southward component, and opposite to the westward component.

Thus, the westward distance w = 116 * sin(51°). Yes, that matches. So, w = 116 * sin(51°). Now, compute this value numerically.

Calculating sin(51°). Let me recall that sin(51°) ≈ approximately 0.7771. Let me check with calculator input. Well, assuming I don't have a calculator, but maybe I can recall some values. Alternatively, note that 51 degrees is close to 45°, whose sine is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071, and 60° is √3/2 ≈ 0.8660. So 51° is between them. Let me approximate sin(51°):

Using linear approximation or just accept that precise calculation requires calculator. But since this is a problem likely expecting calculator usage, let me proceed with the calculation.

Assuming that I can compute sin(51°). Let me convert 51 degrees to radians if needed, but perhaps I can just use a calculator. Alternatively, use known values. However, for the purpose of this problem, I'll proceed with the exact expression and then compute its numerical value.

So, w = 116 * sin(51°). Let me compute that.

First, converting 51 degrees to radians isn't necessary here. Let me use a calculator for sin(51°). 

Calculating sin(51°):

I know that sin(51°) ≈ 0.7771. Let me confirm with more accurate value. Using a calculator, sin(51°) ≈ 0.7771459615...

So multiplying 116 by 0.7771459615:

First, approximate 116 * 0.7771 ≈ ?

Well, 100 * 0.7771 = 77.71

16 * 0.7771 = 12.4336

Adding together: 77.71 + 12.4336 ≈ 90.1436

But let me do a more precise calculation.

Compute 116 × sin(51°):

Using calculator steps:

First, ensure the calculator is in degree mode. Assuming that, sin(51) ≈ 0.7771459615.

Then 116 × 0.7771459615 ≈ ?

Calculate 100 × 0.7771459615 = 77.71459615

16 × 0.7771459615 = Let's compute 10 × 0.7771459615 = 7.771459615, plus 6 × 0.7771459615 = 4.662875769

Total for 16 × ... is 7.771459615 + 4.662875769 ≈ 12.43433538

Add to previous 77.71459615 + 12.43433538 ≈ 90.14893153

So approximately 90.1489 km. Rounded to one decimal place, that would be 90.1 km. Wait, but let me check if my approximated value of sin(51°) is accurate enough. Maybe there's a slight error here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach using the given predicates? Wait, the problem mentions several geometric predicates. Let me look back at those.

Looking back, the given predicates include things like Point(O), Line(O,N), Line(O,W), Line(O,S), Perpendicular(Line(O,N),Line(O,W)), LengthOf(Line(O,SailingEnd))=116, MeasureOf(Angle(N,O,SailingEnd))=231, RightAngle(Angle(W,SailingEnd,Vertical)), LengthOf(Line(W,SailingEnd))=w, PointLiesOnLine(W,Line(O,W)), etc. Also, Triangle(O,W,SailingEnd), RightAngle(Angle(O,W,SailingEnd)).

Hmm, perhaps this is a diagram involving points O, W, S, N, and SailingEnd. Let me try to parse these.

From the given, O is a point. Lines ON, OW, OS are drawn. They are perpendicular to each other: Perpendicular(Line(O,N),Line(O,W)). So line ON is perpendicular to line OW. Also, there's a triangle OWSailingEnd, with a right angle at O, W, SailingEnd. Wait, the Angle(O,W,SailingEnd) is a right angle. So triangle OWSailingEnd is a right-angled triangle at W. 

Also, there's a measure of angle NOSailingEnd as 231 degrees. Wait, the MeasureOf(Angle(N,O,SailingEnd))=231. So angle at point O between points N and SailingEnd is 231 degrees. Also, the length of Line(O,SailingEnd) is 116, which is the same as the distance Luke sailed, 116 km. And we need to find w, which is the length of Line(W,SailingEnd), which is the westward distance from O to SailingEnd.

So, putting this into a geometric diagram: O is the origin. Lines ON, OW, OS are three lines from O, with ON perpendicular to OW. The angle between ON and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees. The triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W, meaning that angle at W is 90 degrees. So, in triangle OWSailingEnd, right-angled at W. Therefore, OW is perpendicular to WSailingEnd. 

Given that, we can model this as a coordinate system where O is the origin. Let me assign coordinates. Let’s assume O is at (0,0). Since lines ON, OW, OS are present, and they are perpendicular. Let me suppose that ON is the vertical axis (north-south), OW is the horizontal axis (east-west), and OS is another line. Wait, but the lines ON, OW, and OS are all emanating from O. Given that ON and OW are perpendicular, as per Perpendicular(Line(O,N),Line(O,W)). 

So, if ON is the north-south line, then OW is the east-west line. The third line, OS, is another line from O. The angle between ON and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees, which is the measure of angle NOSailingEnd. So, at point O, between points N and SailingEnd, the angle is 231 degrees. 

But since ON is a line (presumably north), and SailingEnd is a point somewhere. Let me try to sketch this mentally. At point O, there's line ON (let's say upwards as north), line OW (to the east), and the line OS (some other direction). The angle between ON and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees. So, the direction from O to SailingEnd makes an angle of 231 degrees with ON (the north line). 

Since ON is north, and the angle between ON and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees, which is a large angle, implying that SailingEnd is located southwest of O. 

Moreover, the triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W. So, points O, W, SailingEnd form a right triangle with the right angle at W. Therefore, the segment WSailingEnd is perpendicular to OW. Since OW is the east-west line, then WSailingEnd is vertical (north-south) or something else? Wait, if OW is east-west, then a line perpendicular to OW would be north-south. So, if the right angle is at W, then the sides OW and WSailingEnd are perpendicular. Thus, WSailingEnd is perpendicular to OW, which is the east-west line. Hence, WSailingEnd is either north or south direction. 

But since the angle at O between ON and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees, which is a bearing-like angle, perhaps we can relate this to the coordinates. 

Let me formalize this. Assign coordinates to the points. Let’s set up a coordinate system with O at (0,0). Let’s define the line ON as the positive y-axis (north), and line OW as the positive x-axis (east). The line OS is another line from O making an angle of 231 degrees with ON. 

But since angle NOSailingEnd is 231 degrees, that implies that the direction from O to SailingEnd is 231 degrees from ON (which is the positive y-axis). So, if ON is the positive y-axis, then the angle between the positive y-axis and the line OSailingEnd is 231 degrees. 

To find the coordinates of SailingEnd, we can parametrize it. Let me consider the angle between ON (positive y-axis) and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees. Since angles in standard position are measured from the positive x-axis, but here it's from the positive y-axis. So, converting this angle to standard position (from positive x-axis), we can compute it as follows:

If the angle from the positive y-axis is 231 degrees clockwise (assuming bearings are measured clockwise from north), then the standard angle (counterclockwise from positive x-axis) would be 90° - 231° = -141°, which is equivalent to 219° (by adding 360°). Therefore, the direction of SailingEnd is 219° in standard position. 

This corresponds to a point in the third quadrant (since 180° < 219° < 270°). The coordinates of SailingEnd would then be (116*cos(219°), 116*sin(219°)). 

But since we need to find w, which is the length of WSailingEnd. From the given, the triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W. So, W lies on the line OW (the x-axis), and WSailingEnd is perpendicular to OW. Therefore, the point W is somewhere on the x-axis, and WSailingEnd is vertical (since OW is horizontal). 

Wait, but in the problem statement, there is a predicate "RightAngle(Angle(W,SailingEnd,Vertical))". Wait, the original problem says "RightAngle(Angle(W,SailingEnd,Vertical))". Wait, that might imply that the angle at SailingEnd between W and Vertical is a right angle. But I'm getting confused here. Let me re-examine the given predicates.

Original given predicates include:

"RightAngle(Angle(W,SailingEnd,Vertical))"

Ah, so the angle at SailingEnd between points W, SailingEnd, and Vertical is a right angle. Wait, but "Vertical" is probably referring to a line, maybe the line OS? Not sure. Wait, the initial lines mentioned are Line(O,N), Line(O,W), Line(O,S). So maybe "Vertical" refers to Line(O,N)? Since Line(O,N) is the north-south line, which could be considered vertical. 

Alternatively, perhaps "Vertical" is a typo or shorthand for another line. However, considering the given, perhaps "Vertical" refers to Line(O,N), which is the vertical line (north-south). So, the angle at SailingEnd between W, SailingEnd, and the vertical line (Line(O,N)) is a right angle. Therefore, the angle between WSailingEnd and Line(O,N) is 90 degrees. 

In that case, WSailingEnd is perpendicular to Line(O,N). Since Line(O,N) is the vertical line (north-south), then WSailingEnd is horizontal, i.e., parallel to the x-axis (OW). Wait, but earlier we had that triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W. So, combining these two pieces of information. 

Wait, if the angle at SailingEnd between W and Vertical (Line(O,N)) is a right angle, then WSailingEnd is perpendicular to Line(O,N). Since Line(O,N) is vertical, WSailingEnd is horizontal. Therefore, WSailingEnd is horizontal, meaning it's parallel to OW. Therefore, the segment WSailingEnd is horizontal (same direction as OW), which is the x-axis. 

But triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W. So, in triangle OWSailingEnd, the right angle is at W. So, segments OW and WSailingEnd meet at W at a right angle. Since WSailingEnd is horizontal (parallel to OW), but OW is also horizontal (as part of the x-axis). Wait, that would mean that the triangle OWSailingEnd has a right angle at W, with both legs along the x-axis? That doesn't seem possible unless SailingEnd is vertically aligned with O, but that contradicts the angle measure. 

Wait, perhaps I made an error in interpreting the angle. Let me re-express the given predicates carefully.

The given includes:

"RightAngle(Angle(W,SailingEnd,Vertical))"

Assuming "Vertical" refers to Line(O,N), which is the vertical line (north-south). So, the angle at SailingEnd between W, SailingEnd, and Vertical is a right angle. That is, the angle between the lines SailingEndW and SailingEndVertical is 90 degrees. So, at point SailingEnd, the lines from SailingEnd to W and from SailingEnd to Vertical (which is Line(O,N)) form a right angle. 

Therefore, the line from SailingEnd to W is perpendicular to the line from SailingEnd to Vertical (Line(O,N)). 

Since Line(O,N) is vertical (north-south), then the line from SailingEnd to Vertical is vertical. Therefore, the line from SailingEnd to W is horizontal. Therefore, the segment WSailingEnd is horizontal. 

But since triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W, the segments OW and WSailingEnd meet at W at a right angle. Since WSailingEnd is horizontal (as determined), and OW is also horizontal (being the x-axis), this would imply that the angle at W is between OW and WSailingEnd, both of which are horizontal, which would make the angle zero, not a right angle. Contradiction! There must be an error in my interpretation. 

Alternatively, maybe "Vertical" refers to another line. Let me re-examine the given predicates again. The initial lines are Line(O,N), Line(O,W), Line(O,S). Perhaps "Vertical" refers to Line(O,S)? No, that's not indicated. Alternatively, maybe "Vertical" is a separate line, but the problem didn't mention it. 

Wait, maybe the predicate is written incorrectly. Maybe it's supposed to be "RightAngle(Angle(W, SailingEnd, N))", meaning the angle at SailingEnd between W and N is a right angle. Let me think. If that's the case, then at SailingEnd, the lines from SailingEnd to W and from SailingEnd to N form a right angle. 

Assuming that, then the line SailingEndN is perpendicular to SailingEndW. So, if SailingEndN is a line from SailingEnd to N (which is on Line(O,N)), then the direction from SailingEnd to N is along Line(O,N), which is vertical. So, the line SailingEndN is vertical. Therefore, the line SailingEndW must be horizontal, meaning that WSailingEnd is horizontal. 

Therefore, the segment WSailingEnd is horizontal, so it's parallel to OW. Hence, in triangle OWSailingEnd, right-angled at W, with OW and WSailingEnd meeting at W, and WSailing is horizontal. So, OW is the horizontal line (x-axis), WSailingEnd is also horizontal. Wait, that would make the angle at W between OW and WSailingEnd zero, which can't be. So, contradiction again. 

This suggests that my interpretation might be wrong. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the right angle is at W, as stated by "RightAngle(Angle(O,W,SailingEnd))". So, the angle at W between O, W, SailingEnd is a right angle. Therefore, the triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W. So, OW is perpendicular to WSailingEnd. 

Given that, if OW is the horizontal line (x-axis), then WSailingEnd must be vertical. So, the segment WSailingEnd is vertical. Therefore, from point W, moving vertically to SailingEnd. 

Now, considering that, and the other angle at O being 231 degrees. Let me try to reconcile this. 

We have point O at (0,0). Line OW is the x-axis (east-west). Point W is somewhere on the x-axis. The segment WSailingEnd is vertical (up/down from W), since it's perpendicular to OW. 

So, SailingEnd is vertically aligned with W. Let me denote W as (a, 0) for some a. Then, SailingEnd would be (a, b) for some b, since it's vertical from W. 

Now, the length of OSailingEnd is 116 km. The coordinates of SailingEnd are (a, b), so the distance from O to SailingEnd is sqrt(a² + b²) = 116. 

Additionally, the angle at O between ON (which is the y-axis) and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees. 

Since ON is the positive y-axis, and SailingEnd is at (a, b), the angle between ON (positive y-axis) and OSailingEnd can be found using the dot product or by calculating the angle between the vectors. 

The vector from O to N is along the positive y-axis, say (0,1). The vector from O to SailingEnd is (a, b). The angle between them is 231 degrees. 

However, angles between vectors are usually taken as the smallest angle between them, ranging from 0° to 180°, but here it's given as 231°, which is larger than 180°, suggesting that it's the reflex angle. But in reality, the angle between two lines is the smaller angle between them, so maybe there's confusion here. 

Alternatively, since the angle is given as 231°, which is the angle measured from ON (positive y-axis) clockwise to OSailingEnd. This would mean that the direction of SailingEnd is 231° clockwise from the positive y-axis. 

To find the coordinates of SailingEnd, we can use polar coordinates with respect to the y-axis. Converting this to standard Cartesian coordinates:

If we consider the angle θ = 231° measured clockwise from the positive y-axis, then the standard angle φ from the positive x-axis (counterclockwise) is:

φ = 90° - θ = 90° - 231° = -141°, which is equivalent to 219° (adding 360° to make it positive). 

So, the coordinates of SailingEnd would be:

x = r * cos(φ) = 116 * cos(219°)

y = r * sin(φ) = 116 * sin(219°)

Where r = 116 km.

Now, compute cos(219°) and sin(219°). 

219° is in the third quadrant. Reference angle is 219° - 180° = 39°. So:

cos(219°) = -cos(39°)

sin(219°) = -sin(39°)

Therefore,

x = 116 * (-cos(39°)) ≈ -116 * 0.7771 ≈ -90.14 km

y = 116 * (-sin(39°)) ≈ -116 * 0.6293 ≈ -73.0 km

So, the coordinates of SailingEnd are approximately (-90.14, -73.0). 

Now, since SailingEnd is vertically aligned with W (because WSailingEnd is vertical), as per the right angle at W. So, if SailingEnd is at (a, b), then W must be at (a, 0). So, the x-coordinate of W is the same as that of SailingEnd. 

Therefore, the x-coordinate of SailingEnd is -90.14, so W is at (-90.14, 0). Therefore, the length of WSailingEnd is the difference in y-coordinates, which is b - 0 = b. Since SailingEnd's y-coordinate is -73.0, the length WSailingEnd is |-73.0| = 73.0 km. 

Wait, but according to this, w = 73.0 km. But earlier, when I computed using the bearing method, I got approximately 90.1 km. There's a discrepancy here. Why?

Because in one approach, I considered the angle from the y-axis and used the x-component, while in the other approach, using the triangle with right angle at W, I got a different result. So, which one is correct?

Let me analyze both approaches. 

First approach: Bearing of 231°, leading to westward component w = 116 * sin(51°) ≈ 90.1 km.

Second approach: Using the geometric predicates, finding that SailingEnd's x-coordinate is -90.14, hence w is the horizontal distance from O to W, which is 90.14 km. Wait, no—wait, in the second approach, W is at (a, 0), and SailingEnd is at (a, b). The length WSailingEnd is |b|. But the question asks for w, which is the length of Line(W, SailingEnd), which is |b| in this case. However, the problem states that w is how many kilometers west he has sailed from his starting point. Wait, but if W is at (a, 0), and SailingEnd is at (a, b), then the westward distance from O would depend on the x-coordinate of SailingEnd. 

Wait, no. The question says: "find w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point." So, the westward distance from O is the absolute value of the x-coordinate of SailingEnd, because west is negative x-direction. 

But in the second approach, SailingEnd's x-coordinate is -90.14, so the westward distance is 90.14 km. Whereas in the first approach, using the bearing method, I calculated w as 90.1 km. These match!

But why in the second approach did I get w as |b|? Because in that scenario, I thought w was the length of WSailingEnd, but actually, the question defines w as the length of Line(W, SailingEnd), which is |b|. However, the question says: "w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point." So, that should be the x-coordinate of SailingEnd, which is the westward distance from O. 

Wait, but in the second approach, we found that the x-coordinate of SailingEnd is -90.14, so the westward distance is 90.14 km. Hence, w = 90.1 km. 

But earlier, in the second approach, I mistakenly associated w with the vertical distance, but actually, the problem defines w as the length of Line(W, SailingEnd), which is the vertical distance in this setup. But the question says "how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point," which is the westward component, i.e., the x-coordinate. 

Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify:

If the ship sailed from O to SailingEnd, and the question asks for how far west he is from his starting point (O), that would be the absolute value of the x-coordinate of SailingEnd. 

But in the geometric setup, we have that the length of WSailingEnd is w, which is defined as the length of Line(W, SailingEnd). In the second approach, we found that this length is |b|, which is the vertical distance from W to SailingEnd. But the question is asking for the westward distance from O, which is |a|, where a is the x-coordinate of SailingEnd. 

So, there's a conflict between the definitions. How to resolve this?

Looking back at the problem's predicates:

The given includes "LengthOf(Line(W,SailingEnd))=w". So, the problem defines w as the length of the line segment from W to SailingEnd. 

But the question asks: "If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point..." So, there's a disconnect here. Either the problem has conflicting definitions, or I've misinterpreted something. 

Wait, let me read the problem again:

"Luke sailed for 116 kilometres on a bearing of 231° . If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, find w..."

So, the question defines w as the westward distance from the starting point, which should be the x-coordinate of SailingEnd (if we take O as origin). But the problem's given predicates include "LengthOf(Line(W,SailingEnd))=w", which is the length of the segment from W to SailingEnd. 

This suggests that in the geometric setup, w is defined as the length of WSailingEnd, but the question interprets w as the westward distance from O. This inconsistency indicates that there's a misunderstanding. 

Wait, but looking back at the problem's predicates, there is a RightAngle(Angle(O,W,SailingEnd)), which means that the triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W. Therefore, OW and WSailingEnd are perpendicular. So, if we consider O at (0,0), W at (a,0), and SailingEnd at (a,b), then OW is from (0,0) to (a,0), and WSailingEnd is from (a,0) to (a,b). So, the length of WSailingEnd is |b|, and the length of OW is |a|. 

The total distance sailed is the length from O to SailingEnd, which is sqrt(a² + b²) = 116 km. 

The angle at O between ON (positive y-axis) and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees. As previously calculated, this leads to the coordinates of SailingEnd being (a, b) = (116*cos(219°), 116*sin(29°))? Wait, earlier I said:

x = 116 * cos(219°) = 116 * cos(180° + 39°) = -116 * cos(39°)

y = 116 * sin(219°) = 116 * sin(180° + 39°) = -116 * sin(39°)

So, a = x = -116 * cos(39°), and b = y = -116 * sin(39°). 

Therefore, the length WSailingEnd is |b| = 116 * sin(39°). 

But the question asks for the westward distance from O, which is |a| = 116 * cos(39°). 

Wait, but the problem defines w as the length of WSailingEnd, which is |b| = 116 * sin(39°). But the question says that w is the westward distance. This suggests that there's a mix-up in the problem's definition of w. 

However, given that the problem explicitly states in the predicates that "LengthOf(Line(W,SailingEnd))=w", and the question asks for w as the westward distance, there must be a connection between these two. 

Wait, perhaps there's an error in my assumption about the coordinates. Let me re-express the entire setup. 

Since the triangle OWSailingEnd is right-angled at W, and OW is horizontal (along x-axis), and WSailingEnd is vertical (along y-axis), then the coordinates are:

O at (0,0), W at (a, 0), SailingEnd at (a, b). 

The total distance from O to SailingEnd is sqrt((a)^2 + (b)^2) = 116. 

The angle at O between ON (positive y-axis) and OSailingEnd is 231 degrees. Let me find this angle. 

Vector ON is along positive y-axis, vector OSailingEnd is from O to (a, b). The angle between these vectors is 231 degrees. 

To find this angle, we can use the dot product formula. 

The dot product between vector ON (which is (0,1)) and vector OSailingEnd (a, b) is (0)(a) + (1)(b) = b. 

The magnitudes are |ON| = 1, |OSailingEnd| = 116. 

Dot product formula: b = |ON||OSailingEnd|cos(theta), where theta is the angle between them. 

So, b = 1 * 116 * cos(theta) => cos(theta) = b / 116. 

But theta is given as 231 degrees. So:

cos(231°) = b / 116 => b = 116 * cos(231°). 

But earlier, we found that b = -116 * sin(39°). Let's check if these are consistent. 

Compute cos(231°). 231° is in the third quadrant, reference angle 231 - 180 = 51°, so cos(231°) = -cos(51°). 

So, b = 116 * (-cos(51°)) = -116 * cos(51°). 

But earlier, from the coordinate calculation, b = -116 * sin(39°). Are these equal? 

Note that cos(51°) = sin(39°), because cos(90° - x) = sin(x). So cos(51°) = sin(39°). Hence, -116 * cos(51°) = -116 * sin(39°), which matches. So, both expressions for b are consistent. 

Therefore, the length of WSailingEnd is |b| = 116 * sin(39°). 

But the question asks for w, which is the westward distance from O. This is |a| = 116 * cos(51°), since a = -116 * cos(51°). 

Wait, but the problem defines w as the length of Line(W, SailingEnd), which is |b| = 116 * sin(39°). However, the question says that w is how many kilometers west he has sailed, which should be |a|. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's wording, or perhaps my understanding is incorrect. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem defines w as the westward distance, which is |a|, and the given predicate "LengthOf(Line(W,SailingEnd))=w" is a red herring, or perhaps there's a miscalculation. 

Wait, let me check the given predicates again. It says:

"RightAngle(Angle(W,SailingEnd,Vertical))" — possibly indicating that the angle at SailingEnd between W and Vertical is a right angle. Earlier, I assumed that "Vertical" refers to Line(O,N), which is the y-axis. If that's the case, then the line from SailingEnd to Vertical (y-axis) is vertical, and the line from SailingEnd to W is horizontal, hence forming a right angle at SailingEnd. 

In this case, the segment WSailingEnd is horizontal, and the segment SailingEndVertical is vertical. So, the coordinates of SailingEnd would be such that the horizontal segment WSailingEnd is from W to SailingEnd, and vertical segment from SailingEnd to Vertical (y-axis). 

Wait, this complicates things further. Let me try to redefine. 

If the angle at SailingEnd between W and Vertical (y-axis) is a right angle, then the lines SailingEndW and SailingEndVertical are perpendicular. So, if Vertical is the y-axis, then SailingEndVertical is the line from SailingEnd to the y-axis. Hence, the line SailingEndVertical is horizontal or vertical? If Vertical is the y-axis, then the line from SailingEnd to the y-axis is horizontal if SailingEnd is horizontally aligned with the y-axis. 

This is getting too convoluted. Perhaps I should focus on the fact that the problem gives two different ways to calculate w: one via the bearing (leading to w = 116 * sin(51°) ≈ 90.1 km) and another via the geometric setup, leading to w = 116 * sin(39°) ≈ 116 * 0.6293 ≈ 73.0 km. 

These results differ, so which one is correct? 

Let me cross-verify with the given angle MeasureOf(Angle(N,O,SailingEnd))=231°. 

If the angle at O between ON (y-axis) and OSailingEnd is 231°, then this angle is the angle between the positive y-axis and the line OSailingEnd, measured clockwise. 

If we consider this angle, then the coordinates of SailingEnd are such that tan(theta) = x/y, where theta is the angle from the y-axis. Wait, no. If we have an angle of 231° from the y-axis, then the slope of the line OSailingEnd is tan(231° - 90°)? Not sure. 

Alternatively, using the earlier calculation, the coordinates of SailingEnd are (a, b) = (116 * cos(219°), 116 * sin(219°)). 

Which gives a = 116 * cos(219°) ≈ 116 * cos(219°) ≈ 116 * (-0.7771) ≈ -90.14, and b = 116 * sin(219°) ≈ 116 * (-0.6293) ≈ -73.0. 

So, the westward distance from O is |a| = 90.14 km, and the length of WSailingEnd is |b| = 73.0 km. 

But the problem defines w as the length of WSailingEnd, which is 73.0 km, but the question asks for w as the westward distance, which is 90.14 km. This suggests that there's a mistake in the problem's setup or my interpretation. 

However, given that the problem specifies in the predicates that "LengthOf(Line(W,SailingEnd))=w", and the question asks for w as the westward distance, there must be a reconciliation. 

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in associating the angle. Let me revisit the angle MeasureOf(Angle(N,O,SailingEnd))=231°. 

This angle is at point O, between points N, O, and SailingEnd. So, it's the angle between ON and OSailingEnd at point O. 

If ON is the positive y-axis, and SailingEnd is at (a, b), then the angle between ON (positive y-axis) and OSailingEnd is 231°. 

This can be calculated using the arctangent of (a/b), but since the angle is measured clockwise from ON, it's more complex. 

Alternatively, using the earlier calculation, the coordinates give a = -90.14, b = -73.0. 

The angle between ON (positive y-axis) and OSailingEnd can be calculated as follows: 

The vector from O to SailingEnd is (a, b). The angle between this vector and the positive y-axis is the angle whose tangent is a/b. Wait, no. The angle between the vector and the y-axis is given by:

tan(theta) = (x)/y, where x is the x-component and y is the y-component of the vector. 

But since the angle is measured clockwise from the y-axis, theta = 231°. 

So, tan(theta) = x/y. 

Here, x = a = -90.14, y = b = -73.0. 

So, tan(theta) = (-90.14)/(-73.
