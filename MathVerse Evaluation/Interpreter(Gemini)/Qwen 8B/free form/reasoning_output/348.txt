A helicopter is flying at an altitude of 198 metres, at an angle of depression of 44° to its landing pad. What is the distance d between the helicopter and the landing pad?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a helicopter flying at an altitude of 198 meters, and the angle of depression to the landing pad is 44 degrees. We need to find the distance d between the helicopter and the landing pad. 

First, I should recall what angle of depression means. From what I remember, the angle of depression is the angle formed between the horizontal line from the observer (in this case, the helicopter) and the line of sight to the object (the landing pad). Since the helicopter is above the landing pad, this angle is below the horizontal. But because of the properties of alternate interior angles, this angle of depression is congruent to the angle of elevation from the landing pad up to the helicopter. So, maybe we can model this as a right triangle where one of the angles is 44 degrees, and the side opposite that angle is the vertical distance (altitude) of 198 meters. The hypotenuse would then be the distance d we need to find.

Wait, the problem mentions several geometric predicates. Let me check those again. There's a Triangle(Helicopter, A, LandingPad), RightAngle(Angle(Helicopter, A, LandingPad)), MeasureOf(Angle(A, Helicopter, LandingPad), 44), LengthOf(Line(A, LandingPad), 198), IsHypotenuseOf(Line(Helicopter, LandingPad), Triangle(...)), and also some trigonometric functions like SinOf, CosOf, TanOf. Also, there's a Perpendicular relationship between Line(A, Helicopter) and Line(A, LandingPad). Hmm, so point A is probably the right-angle vertex? Because the RightAngle predicate says Angle(Helicopter, A, LandingPad) is a right angle. Wait, but in standard triangle notation, the middle letter is the vertex. So Angle(Helicopter, A, LandingPad) would mean the angle at point A between points Helicopter and LandingPad. Therefore, triangle Helicopter-A-LandingPad has a right angle at A. 

But if that's the case, then the sides would be: HA (from Helicopter to A), AL (from A to LandingPad), and HL (from Helicopter to LandingPad, which is the hypotenuse). Wait, but the problem states that the length of Line(A, LandingPad) is 198. Wait, no—wait, the LengthOf(Line(A, LandingPad), 198) is given. So the segment from A to LandingPad is 198 meters. But since the triangle is right-angled at A, then HA and AL are the legs, and HL is the hypotenuse. However, the altitude here is the vertical distance from the helicopter to the landing pad. Wait, but the altitude is given as 198 meters. If the helicopter is directly above the landing pad, then the altitude would be the vertical leg. But in this case, the triangle isn't necessarily having the vertical leg as HA or AL. Maybe I need to clarify the configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the right angle is at A, making HA and AL perpendicular. Then, the altitude from the helicopter to the landing pad would be along HA or AL? Wait, the altitude is the vertical distance. Suppose the helicopter is at H, the landing pad is at L, and point A is somewhere else. But according to the given, the triangle is Helicopter, A, LandingPad, with a right angle at A. So, the right angle is at point A, so HA and LA are the two legs, and HL is the hypotenuse. Now, the altitude mentioned is 198 meters. Wait, but the altitude in this scenario—if the helicopter is flying at an altitude, that would be the vertical distance from the helicopter to the ground level. But how does that relate to the triangle? Maybe point A is the projection of the helicopter onto the ground? Or perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the altitude refers to the height of the triangle, but in this case, since it's a right triangle, the altitude could be one of the legs.

Wait, the problem says "a helicopter is flying at an altitude of 198 metres". So that's the vertical distance from the helicopter to the landing pad. So, if we imagine the helicopter is directly above the landing pad, then the altitude would be the straight-line vertical distance. But in the triangle given, the right angle is at point A. So, perhaps point A is the foot of the altitude? Wait, but the triangle is Helicopter, A, LandingPad. If the right angle is at A, then HA and LA are perpendicular. So, HA and LA are the legs. The altitude from the helicopter to the landing pad would be the vertical leg, assuming HA is vertical. Wait, maybe the altitude is HA. Let me try to visualize this. Suppose the helicopter is at point H, the landing pad is at point L, and point A is somewhere such that angle at A is the right angle. So, HA and LA are perpendicular. If the helicopter is flying horizontally, then the altitude would be the vertical distance from H to the ground, which would be the same as the length of HA if A is on the ground. But the problem says the altitude is 198 meters, so HA would be 198 meters. However, the given LengthOf(Line(A, LandingPad)) is 198. That seems conflicting unless A is the landing pad itself, but that can't be. Wait, the problem says "LengthOf(Line(A, LandingPad), 198)", so that's the length from A to LandingPad is 198. If the right angle is at A, then HA and LA are the legs, with LA being from A to LandingPad. So LA is 198 meters. Then, if HA is the vertical altitude, then HA is another leg. But then the hypotenuse HL would be the distance between H and L. However, the question asks for the distance d between the helicopter and the landing pad, which is the hypotenuse HL. 

So, in this setup, the triangle has legs HA and LA, with LA being 198 meters. The angle at H is given as 44 degrees? Wait, the MeasureOf(Angle(A, Helicopter, LandingPad), 44). Wait, the angle at Helicopter? Wait, the measure is Angle(A, Helicopter, LandingPad). In terms of angle notation, that would be the angle at Helicopter between points A and LandingPad. Wait, that's confusing. Let me parse this again. The angle is written as Angle(A, Helicopter, LandingPad). Typically, angle notation is Angle(Vertex, Point1, Point2), so the middle term is the vertex. So Angle(A, Helicopter, LandingPad) would mean the angle at Helicopter between points A and LandingPad. So, that angle is 44 degrees. 

But in our triangle, the right angle is at A. So, the triangle has vertices at H (helicopter), A, and L (landing pad), with right angle at A. So, the angle at A is 90 degrees, and the other two angles at H and L are acute. The given angle is at H, which is 44 degrees. So, in triangle HAL, angle at H is 44 degrees, right angle at A, and angle at L is complementary to 44 degrees, so 46 degrees. 

Given that, we can use trigonometry. Since we know one angle (at H) and the length of the side opposite to it. Wait, which side is opposite to the 44-degree angle? In triangle HAL, angle at H is 44 degrees. The side opposite to angle H is AL. Because angle H is at H, so the opposite side is AL. And they told us that the length of AL is 198 meters. So, AL = 198 m. Therefore, in triangle HAL, we have angle H = 44°, opposite side AL = 198 m. The hypotenuse is HL, which is the distance d we need to find. 

So, using trigonometry, specifically sine, cosine, or tangent. Since we have the opposite side and want the hypotenuse, we can use sine. Sine of angle H equals opposite over hypotenuse. So sin(44°) = AL / HL. Therefore, HL = AL / sin(44°). Plugging in AL = 198 m, we get d = 198 / sin(44°). 

Let me verify that. Yes, because in a right triangle, sin(theta) = opposite/hypotenuse. Here, theta is 44°, opposite side is AL = 198, hypotenuse is HL = d. So yes, that formula holds. 

Now, compute this value. First, calculate sin(44°). Let me recall that sin(44°) is approximately... Well, I can use a calculator for that. But since I don't have a calculator here, I need to remember or estimate. Alternatively, think about standard angles. But since the problem allows using the predicates including SinOf, CosOf, TanOf, maybe I'm supposed to use these functions. But regardless, the calculation would involve computing 198 divided by sin(44 degrees). 

Assuming that I can compute sin(44°). Let me recall that sin(45°) is √2/2 ≈ 0.7071, and sin(30°) is 0.5. So 44° is slightly less than 45°, so sin(44°) is slightly less than 0.7071. Let me approximate it. Using a calculator (pretending I can do that here), sin(44°) ≈ 0.69465837. 

Therefore, d ≈ 198 / 0.69465837 ≈ ?

Calculating that division: 198 ÷ 0.69465837. Let me approximate this. Let me first note that 198 divided by 0.7 is roughly 282.857. Since 0.694658 is slightly less than 0.7, the actual value will be slightly higher than 282.857. Let me compute more accurately. 

Let me write 0.694658 × 285 = ?

Well, 0.694658 × 285 = 0.694658 × 280 + 0.694658 × 5 = 

First, 0.694658 × 280: 0.694658 × 200 = 138.9316, 0.694658 × 80 = 55.57264 → total 138.9316 + 55.57264 = 194.50424

Then add 0.694658 × 5 = 3.47329 → total ≈ 194.50424 + 3.47329 ≈ 197.9775. Which is very close to 198. So, 0.694658 × 285 ≈ 197.9775, which is just slightly less than 198. Therefore, the value of d is approximately 285 meters. 

To be precise, since 0.694658 × 285 ≈ 197.9775, which is 198 - 197.9775 = 0.0225 less than 198. So, we can adjust by adding a small amount. Let me denote that:

Let’s call x = 285 + δ, such that 0.694658 × x = 198. 

We have:

0.694658 × (285 + δ) = 198  
=> 197.9775 + 0.694658 × δ = 198  
=> 0.694658 × δ ≈ 0.0225  
=> δ ≈ 0.0225 / 0.694658 ≈ 0.0324. 

Thus, x ≈ 285 + 0.0324 ≈ 285.0324. So, the value of d is approximately 285.03 meters. Rounding to the nearest whole number gives 285 meters. 

However, let me confirm with a more accurate calculation. If I use a calculator, sin(44°) is approximately 0.69465837. So, 198 divided by 0.69465837 equals approximately 198 / 0.69465837 ≈ 285.03. So, rounding to the nearest whole number is indeed 285. 

Alternatively, maybe there was a mistake in interpreting the angle. Let me recheck. The angle given is Angle(A, Helicopter, LandingPad), which is the angle at Helicopter, between points A and LandingPad. In triangle HAL, that's angle at H, which is 44 degrees. The side opposite to that angle is AL, which is given as 198. Hence, the hypotenuse is HL = d. Therefore, the calculation is correct. 

Another way to think about it: since the angle of depression is 44 degrees, which corresponds to the angle between the horizontal line from the helicopter and the line of sight to the landing pad. This forms a right triangle where the vertical leg is the altitude (opposite side), the horizontal leg is the horizontal distance from the point directly below the helicopter to the landing pad, and the hypotenuse is the distance d. However, in this case, the given side is AL, which is the horizontal leg? Wait, no. Wait, if the angle of depression is 44 degrees, then the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight (hypotenuse) is 44 degrees. Therefore, the vertical leg (altitude) is opposite to this angle. Wait, but earlier analysis said that AL is the horizontal leg. 

Hold on, maybe I confused the sides. Let me draw the triangle mentally. The helicopter is at H, the landing pad is at L, and point A is somewhere. The triangle is H-A-L with a right angle at A. So, HA and AL are perpendicular. The angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal line from H to A (assuming A is the point directly below H?) Wait, but if the right angle is at A, then HA and AL are perpendicular. If the helicopter is at H, and the landing pad is at L, then point A is the point where the horizontal line from H meets the ground. Wait, but the problem doesn't state that A is the point directly below H. It's possible that A is another point. However, given that the angle of depression is involved, which relates the horizontal line from H to the landing pad. 

But perhaps the confusion arises from the labeling. Let me consider that the angle of depression is formed between the horizontal line from H and the line HL (from H to L). The angle of depression is measured from the horizontal down to the line HL. This angle is equal to the angle of elevation from L up to H. In this case, if we form a right triangle where the vertical leg is the altitude (from H vertically down to the ground level), the horizontal leg is the horizontal distance from the point directly under H to L, and the hypotenuse is HL. 

But in the given problem, the triangle is H-A-L with a right angle at A. So, HA and AL are perpendicular. If the vertical leg is HA, then HA is the altitude (198 meters). But the problem says the length of AL is 198 meters. So AL is 198. Therefore, AL is the horizontal leg, HA is the vertical leg, and HL is the hypotenuse. Then, the angle at H (angle between HA and HL) would be the angle of depression. 

In this case, the angle at H is between HA (vertical) and HL (hypotenuse). The angle of depression is that angle. So, tan(angle of depression) = opposite / adjacent = AL / HA. Wait, but angle of depression is between the horizontal and the line of sight. If HA is vertical, then the horizontal line from H would be perpendicular to HA. Therefore, the angle of depression is between the horizontal and HL, which would make the angle at H between HA (vertical) and HL. Wait, this seems conflicting. Let me clarify. 

If HA is vertical (altitude), then the horizontal line from H would be perpendicular to HA. So, the angle of depression is between the horizontal (which is perpendicular to HA) and the line HL. Thus, the angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal and HL, which is the same as the angle between the horizontal and HL. Let me consider triangle HLA, right-angled at A. The angle at H is between HA (vertical) and HL (hypotenuse). However, the angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal and HL. So, the horizontal line from H would be in the direction of AL (since AL is horizontal, being perpendicular to HA). Therefore, the angle of depression is the angle between AL (horizontal) and HL (hypotenuse), which is the same as angle at H between AL and HL. Wait, but in triangle HLA, angle at H is between HA and HL. So, if AL is horizontal, then the horizontal line from H is along HA? No, HA is vertical. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. 

Alternatively, perhaps the triangle is set up such that AL is the horizontal leg, HA is the vertical leg (altitude), and HL is the hypotenuse. Then, the angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal (AL) and the hypotenuse (HL), which is the angle at H between AL and HL. In that case, tan(angle of depression) = opposite / adjacent = HA / AL. Given that HA is the vertical leg (altitude), which is 198 meters? Wait, no—the problem says the altitude is 198 meters. If HA is the altitude, then HA is 198. But in the given predicates, the length of AL is 198. So AL is 198. 

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me go back to the given data. The problem states: "LengthOf(Line(A, LandingPad), 198)". So, AL = 198. The triangle is right-angled at A, so HA and AL are the legs, and HL is the hypotenuse. The angle at H is 44 degrees. So, in triangle HAL, angle at H is 44 degrees. The side opposite to this angle is AL (since angle at H is between HA and HL; the side opposite is AL). So, AL = 198. Therefore, using trigonometry: 

sin(angle at H) = opposite / hypotenuse => sin(44°) = AL / HL => HL = AL / sin(44°) = 198 / sin(44°). 

Which is what I had before. So even though there was confusion about the altitude, the given side AL is 198, which is the opposite side to the 44-degree angle. Hence, the calculation remains the same. 

Therefore, calculating 198 divided by sin(44°) gives approximately 285.03 meters, which rounds to 285 meters. 

I think that's solid. Let me double-check with another approach. If I use the tangent function instead. The angle of depression is 44 degrees. In the right triangle, the tangent of the angle is opposite over adjacent. But wait, if the angle is at H, then the opposite side is AL (horizontal), and the adjacent side is HA (vertical). Wait, but that would be tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent = AL / HA. However, we don't know HA. But if we use the given that AL is 198, then tan(44°) = 198 / HA => HA = 198 / tan(44°). Then, the hypotenuse HL can be found via Pythagoras: HL = sqrt(AL² + HA²). 

Alternatively, since we have angle at H, we can use cosine. Cosine of the angle is adjacent over hypotenuse. Adjacent side is HA, hypotenuse is HL. So cos(44°) = HA / HL => HA = HL * cos(44°). Also, from tan(44°) = AL / HA => tan(44°) = 198 / HA => HA = 198 / tan(44°). Equate the two expressions for HA: 

HL * cos(44°) = 198 / tan(44°)

Solving for HL:

HL = [198 / tan(44°)] / cos(44°) = 198 / [tan(44°) * cos(44°)]

But tan(θ) = sin(θ)/cos(θ), so substituting:

HL = 198 / [ (sin(44°)/cos(44°)) * cos(44°) ) ] = 198 / sin(44°), which brings us back to the original formula. So either method confirms that HL = 198 / sin(44°). 

Therefore, my initial calculation stands. Calculating this numerically:

sin(44°) ≈ 0.69465837

So, d = 198 / 0.69465837 ≈ 285.03 meters. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 285 meters.

Just to ensure that I didn't mix up the sides, let me confirm once more. The angle of depression is 44 degrees, which corresponds to the angle between the horizontal and the line of sight (HL). In the right triangle, this angle is at H, with the opposite side being the vertical leg HA (altitude), and the adjacent side being the horizontal leg AL. Wait, but earlier we thought AL was 198. Wait, if the angle of depression is between the horizontal and HL, then the opposite side would be the vertical leg (HA), and the adjacent side is the horizontal leg (AL). So tan(angle) = HA / AL. But we were given AL = 198. So if we knew HA, we could find the angle. However, in this problem, we're given the angle and AL, and need to find HL. 

Wait, this suggests that my previous assumption may have been incorrect. Let me re-express this carefully. 

If the angle of depression is 44 degrees, then in the right triangle formed by the helicopter, the landing pad, and the point directly below the helicopter (let's say point B), we have:

- HB is the vertical leg (altitude) = ?
- AB is the horizontal leg (distance from point directly below H to L) = ?
- HL is the hypotenuse (distance d).

The angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal AB and the hypotenuse HL. So, tan(angle of depression) = opposite / adjacent = HB / AB. 

However, in the given problem, the triangle is H-A-L with a right angle at A. So, HA and AL are the legs. If point A is the point directly below the helicopter, then HA is the vertical leg (altitude), and AL is the horizontal leg. Thus, the angle at H between HA and HL would be the angle of depression. But in that case, tan(angle of depression) = opposite / adjacent = AL / HA. 

But in this scenario, we are given AL = 198 meters. If we assume that AL is the horizontal leg (AB), then we have tan(44°) = HB / AL => HB = AL * tan(44°). Then, the hypotenuse HL is sqrt(HB² + AL²) = sqrt((AL * tan(44°))² + AL²) = AL * sqrt(tan²(44°) + 1) = AL * sec(44°). Since sec(θ) = 1 / cos(θ), so HL = AL / cos(44°). 

Wait, this contradicts my previous conclusion. So which is correct? 

This shows that depending on which side is considered the opposite or adjacent, the formula changes. So, which interpretation is correct? 

Let me clarify with the given triangle. The triangle is H-A-L, right-angled at A. So, angle at A is 90°, angle at H is 44°, angle at L is 46°. The sides are:

- HA: from H to A
- AL: from A to L
- HL: from H to L

Since the right angle is at A, HA and AL are perpendicular. The angle at H is between HA and HL. So, in this triangle, the angle at H is between HA (one leg) and HL (hypotenuse). The side opposite to angle H is AL. So, AL is opposite angle H. Therefore, using the sine function: 

sin(angle H) = opposite / hypotenuse => sin(44°) = AL / HL => HL = AL / sin(44°) = 198 / sin(44°). 

But if we consider the angle of depression, which is the angle between the horizontal (from H) and the line of sight (HL), then that angle would be equal to the angle at H in the triangle. Therefore, the angle of depression is 44°, and the opposite side is the vertical leg (HB), while the adjacent side is the horizontal leg (AB). However, in this problem, the horizontal leg is AL, which is 198 meters. Wait, but if AL is the horizontal leg, then it's AB, and the vertical leg is HA. So, in that case, tan(angle of depression) = HA / AL. 

But in this scenario, we are given AL = 198, and we need to find HL. But if we use the angle of depression, we have tan(44°) = HA / AL => HA = AL * tan(44°). Then, HL = sqrt(HA² + AL²) = AL * sqrt(tan²(44°) + 1) = AL * sec(44°). 

So, which is correct? Why the discrepancy?

Ah! The issue is whether AL is the horizontal leg or the vertical leg. In the given problem, the LengthOf(Line(A, LandingPad)) is 198, which is AL. If AL is the horizontal leg, then HA is the vertical leg (altitude). But if the angle of depression is 44°, then tan(44°) = HA / AL. But we aren't given HA, so we cannot directly compute HL without additional info. However, in the given problem, the triangle is specified as having a right angle at A, and the angle at H is 44°, with AL = 198. 

From the triangle's perspective, since AL is opposite angle H, then using sine gives HL = AL / sin(44°). But if AL is the horizontal leg, then HA is the vertical leg, and angle of depression would be between horizontal and HL, giving tan(angle) = HA / AL. 

So there's a contradiction unless HA is related to AL via the angle. Therefore, which interpretation is correct? 

Let me check with the definition of angle of depression. The angle of depression is the angle between the horizontal line from the observer (helicopter) and the line of sight to the object (landing pad). In this case, the horizontal line from the helicopter would be parallel to AL (if AL is horizontal). Therefore, the angle of depression is between the horizontal (AL extended) and the line of sight HL. Therefore, this angle is the same as angle at H in the triangle, which is 44°. 

In this case, the triangle has angle at H of 44°, with AL being the horizontal leg (adjacent to angle H), HA being the vertical leg (opposite to angle H), and HL being the hypotenuse. Therefore, tan(44°) = HA / AL => HA = AL * tan(44°). Then, HL = sqrt(HA² + AL²) = AL * sqrt(1 + tan²(44°)) = AL / cos(44°). 

Wait, this gives a different expression for HL. Which one is correct? 

Let me take numerical values. Suppose AL = 198, angle of depression = 44°. 

Using tan(44°) = HA / AL => HA = 198 * tan(44°). Compute tan(44°): approximately 0.9657. So HA ≈ 198 * 0.9657 ≈ 191.21 meters. Then, HL = sqrt(191.21² + 198²) ≈ sqrt(36569 + 39204) = sqrt(75773) ≈ 275.27 meters. 

But previously, using HL = AL / sin(44°), we had 198 / 0.6946 ≈ 285.03 meters. These results are conflicting. So why the difference? 

This indicates a fundamental error in assumptions. Where is the mistake?

The key lies in identifying which side is opposite the angle of depression. If the angle of depression is 44°, then in the right triangle formed by the helicopter, the landing pad, and the point directly below the helicopter, the angle of depression is between the horizontal and the hypotenuse. Therefore, the opposite side is the vertical leg (altitude), and the adjacent side is the horizontal leg. 

However, in the given problem, the triangle is defined as H-A-L with right angle at A. So, the triangle includes point A, which might not be the point directly below the helicopter. Therefore, AL is a leg of the triangle, but not necessarily the horizontal leg. 

This suggests that my earlier assumption that AL is the horizontal leg is incorrect. Instead, the horizontal leg is HA or AL, depending on where point A is located. 

Let me clarify: the triangle is H-A-L with right angle at A. So, HA and AL are perpendicular. If the helicopter is at H, and the landing pad is at L, then the right angle at A implies that HA and AL are perpendicular. The altitude (vertical distance) is likely HA, assuming that HA is vertical. But the problem states that the altitude is 198 meters, which would correspond to HA. However, the given LengthOf(Line(A, LandingPad)) is 198, which is AL. So AL is 198 meters. 

If HA is the altitude (vertical), then HA = 198 meters. But that conflicts with the given that AL = 198. Unless HA is not the altitude. Wait, the problem says the helicopter is flying at an altitude of 198 meters. So, the vertical distance from the helicopter to the landing pad is 198 meters. This vertical distance would be HA if A is the point directly below the helicopter. But if AL is 198, then AL is the horizontal leg. 

Wait, this is getting too tangled. Let me switch approaches. 

Let me forget about the triangle and focus on the standard angle of depression problem. 

In standard problems, the angle of depression from the helicopter to the landing pad is 44°, the altitude (height) is 198 meters, and we need to find the distance d. 

In this case, the right triangle has:

- Opposite side: height = 198 m
- Angle of depression: 44°
- Hypotenuse: d

Using trigonometry, sin(44°) = opposite / hypotenuse => d = 198 / sin(44°). 

This matches my initial calculation. So why did the alternative approach give a different result? Because in that approach, I assumed AL is the horizontal leg, but if the altitude is 198, then the vertical leg is 198. 

But in the given problem, the LengthOf(Line(A, LandingPad)) is 198, which is AL. So, if AL is the horizontal leg, then the vertical leg is HA, and the altitude is HA. But the problem states the altitude is 198, so HA = 198. Then, using angle of depression, tan(44°) = HA / AL => AL = HA / tan(44°) = 198 / tan(44°). Then, the hypotenuse d = sqrt(HA² + AL²) = sqrt(198² + (198/tan(44°))²) = 198 / sin(44°). 

Yes! This aligns with the previous result. So, regardless of the approach, the final expression for d is 198 / sin(44°). 

Therefore, the correct value of d is 198 divided by sin(44°), which is approximately 285 meters. 

This resolves the earlier confusion. The key was recognizing that the given AL is the horizontal leg, and the altitude is the vertical leg (HA), leading to the calculation using the angle of depression. 

Thus, the final answer is approximately 285 meters.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Problem Setup**: 
   - A right triangle is formed with the helicopter (H), point A, and the landing pad (L).
   - The right angle is at point A, making HA and AL perpendicular.
   - The angle of depression from the helicopter to the landing pad is 44°, corresponding to the angle at H in the triangle.
   - The length of AL (horizontal leg) is 198 meters, and we seek the hypotenuse HL (distance d).

2. **Trigonometric Relationship**:
   - In triangle HAL, angle at H is 44°, with AL (opposite side) = 198 meters.
   - Using sine: $ \sin(44^\circ) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{198}{d} $.
   - Solving for $ d $: $ d = \frac{198}{\sin(44^\circ)} $.

3. **Numerical Calculation**:
   - Calculate $ \sin(44^\circ) \approx 0.694658 $.
   - Compute $ d = \frac{198}{0.694658} \approx 285.03 $.
   - Round to the nearest whole number: $ \boxed{285} $.

Final Answer: $ \boxed{285} $
