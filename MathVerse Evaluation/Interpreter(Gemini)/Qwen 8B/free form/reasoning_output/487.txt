QUESTION:
There is a piecewise function going through points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the domain and range of a piecewise function that goes through the points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5). Hmm, first I need to visualize these points. Let me plot them mentally. Point A is (-3, 0), B is (0, 5), C is (3, 5), and D is (7, 9). Wait, but the function goes through points A, B, and C? Or maybe it's connected through those points?

Wait, the problem says "a piecewise function going through points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5)." But there's also point D mentioned in the predicates. However, the question specifically mentions the function going through A, B, and C. Maybe D isn't directly part of the function's definition here? Or perhaps the line segments AB, BC, CD form parts of the function? Let me check the given predicates again.

The predicates mention that each point lies on a line segment. So, A lies on line AB, B lies on line AB and line BC, C lies on line BC and line CD, D lies on line CD. So, the points A, B, C, D are colinear in sequence? Wait, no. Because A is on line AB, so AB is a line segment from A to B. Then B is on line BC, which suggests that B is connected to C via another line segment. Wait, but if B is on line BC, that just means that B is one endpoint of that line. Similarly, C is on line CD, so C is the starting point of CD. So overall, we have four points arranged in a straight line? Wait, no. Because A is on line AB, which is a line segment from A to B. Then B is on line BC, which would mean that line BC starts at B and goes through C. But if B is on line BC, then line BC could be extending beyond B? Wait, but the way it's written, PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,B)) implies that B is on line AB, which is obvious since B is an endpoint. Similarly, PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(B,C)) means that B is on line BC. So, line BC is from B to C. So the points are connected as follows: A is connected to B, B is connected to C, C is connected to D. Therefore, the entire figure is a series of connected line segments: AB, BC, CD. So the points are aligned in order A -> B -> C -> D along a straight line? Wait, but looking at the coordinates:

A is (-3,0), B is (0,5), C is (3,5), D is (7,9). Let me check if they lie on a straight line. If we look at the slope from A to B: rise over run is (5-0)/(0 - (-3)) = 5/3. From B to C: (5-5)/(3 - 0) = 0/3 = 0. So horizontal line from B to C. Then from C to D: (9 - 5)/(7 - 3) = 4/4 = 1. So different slopes, so the points are not colinear. Therefore, the lines AB, BC, CD are separate line segments. So the piecewise function passes through A, B, and C. But how does the function go through these points? Since it's a piecewise function, it probably consists of different segments connecting these points. 

So, the function has three segments: from A to B, then from B to C, and possibly from C onwards? Wait, the question mentions the function goes through points A, B, and C. But maybe the function is made up of two segments: from A to B and from B to C. That would make it a piecewise linear function with two segments. Alternatively, if there's more points, but the question specifies only A, B, and C. 

But the problem says "there is a piecewise function going through points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5)". So the function has at least two segments: one from A to B, and another from B to C. So the domain would be from x=-3 to x=3, since those are the x-coordinates of A and C. But wait, the function may continue beyond? Wait, the question doesn't mention point D, but the problem includes it in the predicates. However, the function is defined through A, B, and C, so maybe the function stops at C. So the domain is from x=-3 to x=3. 

But let me think again. If the function is piecewise linear, passing through those three points, then between A and B, it's a line, then between B and C, another line. So the domain would be from x=-3 to x=3. But maybe there's more? Like, if the function continues past C? But the question doesn't specify, so we should assume it's only up to C. 

Alternatively, maybe the function is composed of the lines AB, BC, and CD. But the question says "going through" A, B, and C. So CD is not part of the function unless specified. Therefore, considering only AB and BC. 

So, the function has two segments: from A(-3, 0) to B(0,5), then from B(0,5) to C(3,5). So the domain is all real numbers between -3 and 3. But wait, the x-values of A is -3, B is 0, C is 3. So the domain would be from x=-3 to x=3. 

Now, the range. For the first segment AB: starting at (-3, 0) going to (0,5). So y increases from 0 to 5. For the second segment BC: from (0,5) to (3,5), so y remains constant at 5. Therefore, the range is from 0 to 5, inclusive. 

Therefore, the domain is [-3, 3], and the range is [0, 5]. 

Wait, but let me confirm. The function is defined piecewise, so each segment contributes to the domain and range. The first segment covers x from -3 to 0, the second from 0 to 3. So combined, the domain is [-3, 3]. The range is the union of the outputs of both segments. First segment: y from 0 to 5. Second segment: y is always 5. So overall, the range is [0,5]. 

Yes, that seems correct. So the final answer should be domain [-3, 3], range [0, 5].
