QUESTION:
This is part of a piece of jewellery. It is made out of a metal plate base, and gold plated wire (of negligible thickness) runs around the outside.

What is the area covered by the metal plate base?

Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's try to figure out the area covered by the metal plate base. So, the problem mentions a piece of jewelry made of a metal plate base and gold-plated wires. The question is about finding the area of the metal plate base. 

First, I need to parse the given predicates. Let me list them out again:

Points A, B, C, D, E, F, O1, O2. There are sectors defined: Sector(O1,A,B), Sector(O2,C,D), Sector(E,A,O1), Sector(F,C,O2). Also, there are length measurements: Line(O1,A) is 6 units, same for O2,C. Then, Line(E,A) is 3 units, same for F,C. Also, some equality conditions: the lengths of O1A equals O1B, O2C equals O2D, EA equals EO1, FC equals FO2. The areas of the sectors O1AB and O2CD are equal, and the areas of EAO1 and FCO2 are equal. The angles at O1 (A,O1,B) is 90 degrees, same for others. All those angles are right angles.

So, maybe these sectors are parts of circles? Since they mention sectors, which are parts of circles. Each sector has a radius and a central angle. The area of a sector is (θ/2)*r² where θ is in radians. But since we have right angles here, which is π/2 radians. Wait, but the measure of the angles is given as 90 degrees, so converting that to radians would be π/2. However, maybe we can compute the area directly using the formula for sector area with angle in degrees, which is (θ/360)*π*r². 

But first, let me visualize the setup. Points O1 and O2 are centers of circles. Sectors O1AB and O2CD are sectors with radius OA=OB=6 (since O1A and O1B are equal in length, both being 6). Similarly for O2C and O2D. The other sectors EAO1 and FCO2 are also sectors. Now, points E and F are such that EA=3 and FC=3. Also, the angles at E and F are right angles. 

Wait, for example, Angle(E,A,O1) is 90 degrees. That means that point E lies somewhere such that line segments EA and EO1 form a right angle. Given that EA is 3 units and EO1 is also 3 units (from the equality of lengths: Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,A)), LengthOf(Line(E,O1))). Therefore, triangle EAO1 is a right-angled isoceles triangle with legs of length 3. Similarly for FCO2. 

So, perhaps each of these sectors corresponds to quarter-circles? Because if you have a right angle, then the sector is a quarter-circle. Wait, but the sectors mentioned are Sector(O1,A,B) and Sector(O2,C,D). If the central angle is 90 degrees, then each of those sectors would be a quarter-circle. So, the area of each of those sectors would be (1/4)*π*r². Since r is 6, so area would be (1/4)*π*6² = 9π. Similarly for the other sector O2CD, same area. 

Then, the other sectors are EAO1 and FCO2. These are also right angles, so similar logic applies. Their radii would be the distance from E to O1, which is 3 units (since EA=EO1=3). So, the area of sector EAO1 is (1/4)*π*(3)² = (9/4)π. Same for FCO2. 

But wait, how does this relate to the metal plate base? The problem says it's made of a metal plate base and gold plated wire around the outside. So, the metal plate base might be the region enclosed by all these sectors and lines? Or maybe the union of certain regions? 

Alternatively, perhaps the metal plate base is the area bounded by the outer edges of the sectors? Let me think. Maybe the entire structure is composed of overlapping circles or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the metal plate base refers to the area not covered by the gold wire. But the description isn't entirely clear. However, given that the question asks for the area covered by the metal plate base, and the rest is gold wire, perhaps the metal plate base is the union of certain regions. 

Alternatively, maybe the metal plate base is the area inside the sectors minus the areas of the smaller sectors? Not sure yet. Let me think again. 

Looking back at the given data, there are four sectors: O1AB, O2CD, EAO1, FCO2. But maybe there are more elements? Let me check the points involved. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, O1, O2. 

Let me consider each sector:

- Sector O1AB: center O1, points A and B. Since O1A and O1B are both 6 units, and angle A-O1-B is 90 degrees. So, AB is a chord of the circle centered at O1 with radius 6, subtending a right angle. The length of AB can be found via Pythagoras. In triangle O1AB, since it's a right-angled triangle at O1, AB² = OA² + OB² = 6² + 6² = 72, so AB = sqrt(72) = 6√2. 

Similarly, for Sector O2CD: same thing, CD is 6√2. 

For Sector EAO1: center E, points A and O1. Wait no, the sector is E-A-O1. Wait, the sector is defined as Sector(E,A,O1). Wait, no, the way the predicate is written: "Sector(O1,A,B)" implies that O1 is the center, and A and B are endpoints of the arc. So Sector(E,A,O1) would mean the center is E, and the arc goes from A to O1. Wait, but that seems odd. Wait, the standard notation for a sector is Sector(center, start point, end point). So Sector(O1,A,B) means the sector with center O1, starting at A and ending at B. So the angle is at O1 between A and B. 

Therefore, Sector(E,A,O1) would be a sector with center at E, starting at A and ending at O1. But then the angle would be at E between A and O1. Which matches the MeasureOf(Angle(A,E,O1), 90). So yes, that sector is a right angle at E. 

So, for Sector(E,A,O1): center E, points A and O1. The radius is EA = 3, and EO1 = 3, since EA equals EO1. And the angle at E is 90 degrees. Therefore, the area of that sector is (1/4)*π*(3)^2 = (9/4)π. Similarly for Sector(F,C,O2). 

Now, considering all these sectors, perhaps the metal plate base is formed by combining these sectors? Or maybe subtracting some areas? Alternatively, maybe the metal plate is the union of the outer sectors minus inner ones? 

Alternatively, perhaps the entire figure consists of two large quarter-circles (O1AB and O2CD) connected by smaller quarter-circles (EAO1 and FCO2)? But without seeing the diagram, it's challenging, but given the way the points are set up, maybe the total area is the sum of the areas of these sectors. However, that may not account for overlaps. 

Wait, but the problem states that the metal plate is the base, and the gold wire is around the outside. So perhaps the metal plate base is the area enclosed by the entire figure, which could be the combination of the two larger sectors and the two smaller sectors. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the structure is like two squares connected by semicircular arcs? No, because the sectors are quarters of circles. Let me think again.

Let me try to reconstruct the figure step by step. 

Starting with O1 and O2 as centers. For O1, points A and B are on the circle with radius 6, forming a right angle at O1. So, points A and B are positioned such that O1A and O1B are perpendicular. Similarly for O2 with points C and D. Then, points E and F are such that E is connected to A and O1, forming another right angle at E, with EA=EO1=3. Similarly for F connected to C and O2. 

So, for example, point E is such that it forms a right angle at E between A and O1. Since EA=3 and EO1=3, triangle EAO1 is a right-angled isoceles triangle. So, E is located such that it's 3 units away from both A and O1, with the right angle at E. This suggests that E is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of triangle A-O1-something? Wait, no. Wait, in triangle EAO1, right-angled at E, so the hypotenuse is AO1. The length of AO1 is the distance between A and O1. Wait, but earlier, we had O1A is 6 units. Wait, but in the case of Sector(O1,A,B), O1A is 6, and O1B is 6. So, the distance between A and O1 is 6. So, in triangle EAO1, which is right-angled at E, with legs EA and EO1 each 3, so the hypotenuse AO1 should be sqrt(3² + 3²) = 3√2. But earlier, we said that O1A is 6. Contradiction? Wait, this suggests inconsistency. What's wrong here?

Hold on! Wait, the length of O1A is given as 6. But in the case of triangle EAO1, EA is 3, and EO1 is also 3. So, according to the Pythagorean theorem, AO1 should be sqrt(3² + 3²) = 3√2 ≈ 4.24. But earlier, we were told that O1A is 6. That contradicts unless my understanding is incorrect. 

Where is the mistake here? Let me re-examine the given predicates. 

The given LengthOf(Line(O1,A),6) and Equals(LengthOf(Line(O1,A)), LengthOf(Line(O1,B))). So, O1A = O1B = 6. Also, Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,A)), LengthOf(Line(E,O1))). So, EA = EO1. And MeasureOf(Angle(A,E,O1), 90). So, triangle EAO1 is right-angled at E. Therefore, applying Pythagoras: (EA)^2 + (EO1)^2 = (AO1)^2. But EA = EO1 = x, so 2x² = AO1². Hence, AO1 = x√2. But we know AO1 is 6, so x√2 = 6 → x = 6 / √2 = 3√2 ≈ 4.24. But the problem states that LengthOf(Line(E,A)) is 3. Wait, the given LengthOf(Line(E,A),3). So, EA = 3. Then according to this, 3√2 = AO1. But AO1 was given as 6. Therefore, 3√2 = 6 → √2 = 2 → contradiction. 

That's impossible. There's a contradiction here. Which means my interpretation must be wrong. Where did I go wrong? Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote:

"LengthOf(Line(O1,A),6)

LengthOf(Line(O2,C),6)

LengthOf(Line(E,A),3)

LengthOf(Line(F,C),3)"

And also:

"Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,A)), LengthOf(Line(E,O1)))"

Ah! So LengthOf(Line(E,A)) is 3, and Equals(...) means that LengthOf(Line(E,A)) equals LengthOf(Line(E,O1)). Therefore, LengthOf(Line(E,O1)) is also 3. So, EA = EO1 = 3. Then, in triangle EAO1, which is right-angled at E, the hypotenuse AO1 should be sqrt(3² + 3²) = 3√2. But earlier, we were told that O1A is 6. Therefore, this leads to 3√2 = 6 → √2 = 2, which is false. 

This suggests that there is an error in my understanding of the problem. How can this be resolved? 

Wait, maybe the Angle(A,E,O1) is not the angle between EA and EO1, but between AE and EO1? Wait, no. The angle measure is Angle(A,E,O1), which is the angle at E between points A and O1. So, vertex at E, with sides EA and EO1. Thus, the triangle EAO1 has vertices at E, A, O1, with right angle at E. 

But then, according to this, the hypotenuse AO1 must be 3√2, but the problem says that O1A is 6. This is conflicting. Unless there's another interpretation. Perhaps the points A and O1 are not connected directly? Wait, but the problem states that there is a Line(O1,A) with length 6. So, O1A is a straight line of length 6. Therefore, the distance between O1 and A is 6. 

But in triangle EAO1, if EA and EO1 are both 3, then the distance between A and O1 is supposed to be 3√2. But the problem says it's 6. Therefore, there's a contradiction. This suggests that my initial assumption about the configuration is wrong. 

Wait, perhaps the Angle(A,E,O1) is not referring to the angle between EA and EO1, but between AE and EO1? No, that's the same thing. Alternatively, maybe the sector EAO1 is not a sector with center at E, but the sector is with center at O1? Wait, the way the predicate is written: Sector(E,A,O1). According to the standard notation, the first argument is the center, then the start point, then the end point. So Sector(E,A,O1) would be a sector with center E, starting at A and ending at O1. Therefore, the angle is at E, between A and O1. So, the sector is part of the circle centered at E, with radius EA and EO1. But EA is 3, and EO1 is 3, so the radius is 3. Therefore, the arc from A to O1 on the circle centered at E. 

But then, the distance between A and O1 is not necessarily related to the radius of the circle. Wait, but in this case, A and O1 are points on the circle centered at E with radius 3. So, the distance between A and O1 would depend on the angle between them. Since the angle at E is 90 degrees, the chord length between A and O1 would be 2*R*sin(theta/2), where theta is the central angle. Here, R = 3, theta = 90 degrees. So chord length AO1 = 2*3*sin(45°) = 6*(√2/2) = 3√2 ≈ 4.24. But the problem says that the length of O1A is 6. So this contradicts again. 

Hmm. There's a fundamental inconsistency here. Either the problem has conflicting data, or my interpretation is wrong. Let me check the original problem again. 

Wait, the user wrote:

"LengthOf(Line(O1,A),6)

LengthOf(Line(O2,C),6)

LengthOf(Line(E,A),3)

LengthOf(Line(F,C),3)

Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,A)), LengthOf(Line(E,O1)))

Equals(LengthOf(Line(F,C)), LengthOf(Line(F,O2)))"

So, Line(O1,A) has length 6. So, O1A = 6. Line(E,A) has length 3. And Equals(LengthOf(Line(E,A)), LengthOf(Line(E,O1))), so LengthOf(Line(E,O1)) is also 3. So, E is a point such that its distance to A and to O1 is 3. Therefore, E lies at the intersection of two circles: one centered at A with radius 3, and one centered at O1 with radius 3. 

Additionally, the angle at E between A and O1 is 90 degrees. So, the triangle EAO1 has EA = EO1 = 3, and angle at E is 90 degrees. Therefore, the triangle is a right-angled isoceles triangle, so AO1 should be 3√2. But the problem says that O1A is 6. So, this is a contradiction. 

This suggests that either there is a miscalculation, or misinterpretation of the problem. Let me double-check the problem statement. 

Wait, maybe the Angle(A,E,O1) is not the internal angle of the triangle, but something else? Or maybe the points are arranged differently? For instance, maybe E is not between A and O1, but somewhere else. 

Wait, suppose that E is such that EA = EO1 = 3, and angle A-E-O1 is 90 degrees. So, E is located such that it forms a right angle with A and O1. This would place E somewhere off the line AO1. The locus of points E satisfying EA = EO1 = 3 is the intersection of two circles: one centered at A with radius 3, and one centered at O1 with radius 3. The intersection points would form two points, symmetric with respect to the line AO1. 

If the angle at E is 90 degrees, then E must lie on the circle with diameter AO1. Wait, because in a circle, if you have a right angle subtended by a diameter, then the point lies on the circle. But here, AO1 is length 6, so the diameter would be 6, hence the radius 3. So, the circle with diameter AO1 has radius 3. So, the points E that satisfy EA = EO1 = 3 must lie on this circle. Because for any point E on the circle with diameter AO1, the triangle AEO1 is right-angled at E. 

But the circle with diameter AO1 has radius 3, so the length from E to A and E to O1 would be 3, since the radius is 3. Therefore, this resolves the contradiction! 

Ah! Yes! If AO1 is 6, then the circle with diameter AO1 has radius 3. Therefore, any point E on this circle satisfies EA = EO1 = 3, and angle at E is 90 degrees. So, the previous contradiction was due to misunderstanding that AO1 is the hypotenuse of the triangle, but actually, in this case, AO1 is the diameter of the circle, making the radius 3, hence EA and EO1 are radii of length 3. 

So, this makes sense. Therefore, the distance between A and O1 is 6, which is the diameter of the circle with center at the midpoint of AO1. Points E and F lie on such circles. 

Great, that clears up the confusion. So, now, moving forward. 

Now, going back to the sectors. 

First, the sector O1AB: center at O1, points A and B. Since O1A = O1B = 6, and angle at O1 is 90 degrees. So, this is a quarter-circle with radius 6, central angle 90 degrees. Its area is (1/4)*π*6² = 9π. 

Similarly, sector O2CD is also a quarter-circle with radius 6, area 9π. 

Next, sector EAO1: this is a sector with center at E, points A and O1. Wait, earlier conclusion was that E lies on the circle with diameter AO1 (radius 3), so the distance from E to A and E to O1 is 3. Therefore, the sector EAO1 is a sector of a circle with center at E, radius 3, spanning from A to O1. The central angle at E is 90 degrees, as given. So, the area of this sector is (1/4)*π*3² = (9/4)π. 

Same for sector FCO2: area (9/4)π. 

Now, the question is: what is the area covered by the metal plate base? The problem says it's made of a metal plate base and gold-plated wire around the outside. So, likely, the metal plate base is the area bounded by all these sectors and possibly some other regions. 

But how do these sectors connect? Let me try to imagine the figure. 

We have two large quarter-circles (O1AB and O2CD), each with radius 6. Then, two smaller quarter-circles (EAO1 and FCO2), each with radius 3. 

Assuming that the metal plate base is the union of these four sectors. But need to check for overlaps. 

Alternatively, maybe the metal plate base is the area enclosed by the outer perimeter, which includes the two large quarter-circles and connects via the smaller quarter-circles. 

But without a diagram, it's tricky, but let's proceed logically. 

Suppose that the entire structure is like two square corners (the large quarter-circles) connected by smaller quarter-circles. But perhaps the total area is the sum of the areas of the large quarter-circles minus the areas of the smaller ones? Or vice versa? 

Wait, the gold wire runs around the outside. So, the metal plate base is the interior area. If the figure is constructed by joining these sectors, then the area would be the sum of the areas of the sectors, accounting for overlaps. 

Alternatively, maybe the metal plate base is the area of the two large quarter-circles plus the area of the two small quarter-circles. But that seems too straightforward. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, perhaps the metal plate is the area bounded by the outermost curves, which are the large quarter-circles, and the inner curves are the smaller ones. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's hard to say. 

Wait, let me think about the points. 

For example, take point A. It is part of sector O1AB (centered at O1) and also part of sector EAO1 (centered at E). Similarly for other points. 

Perhaps the entire figure is made up of two large quarter-circles (O1AB and O2CD) and two smaller quarter-circles (EAO1 and FCO2), forming a shape whose area is the sum of all these sectors. But need to verify if there's any overlap. 

Alternatively, maybe the metal plate base is the area of the large quarter-circles minus the areas of the smaller ones? Or maybe the opposite? 

Wait, if the gold wire is around the outside, then the metal plate is the interior. Suppose the structure is like two half-circles connected by smaller arcs. But again, not sure. 

Alternatively, think of it as a composite shape. Let me try calculating the total area contributed by all sectors and see if that gives a plausible answer. 

Total area from large sectors: 9π (for O1AB) + 9π (for O2CD) = 18π. 

Total area from small sectors: (9/4)π (for EAO1) + (9/4)π (for FCO2) = (9/2)π. 

Total combined area: 18π + 4.5π = 22.5π ≈ 70.69... 

But this assumes that all sectors are non-overlapping. However, depending on the arrangement, there might be overlapping regions. 

Alternatively, maybe the metal plate base is just the area of the two large sectors, and the small sectors are subtracted? Like, if the small sectors are holes cut out from the large ones. 

But why would that be the case? If the gold wire is around the outside, maybe the small sectors are the parts that are covered by the wire, and the metal plate is the remaining area. 

But without knowing the exact configuration, it's ambiguous. However, given that the problem involves sectors with right angles and the presence of points E and F, which are connected to O1 and O2, perhaps the overall shape is a square-like figure with rounded edges. 

Another approach: since each of the large sectors is a quarter-circle, and the small sectors are also quarter-circles, perhaps the entire figure is a combination of these sectors forming a larger shape. For example, if you combine two quarter-circles of radius 6 and two quarter-circles of radius 3, the total area might be 18π + 4.5π = 22.5π. But that would be if they're added together. 

However, the problem says that the gold wire runs around the outside. So, the metal plate base is the area enclosed by the outer edges, which might include the large quarter-circles and exclude the small ones. 

Alternatively, think of it as follows: the metal plate base is the union of the two large quarter-circles and the two small quarter-circles. But again, without seeing the diagram, it's hard to tell. 

Wait, let's look back at the problem statement: it says that the jewelry is made of a metal plate base and gold-plated wire around the outside. This suggests that the metal plate is the main body, and the gold wire outlines the perimeter. Therefore, the area of the metal plate base would be the area enclosed by the entire figure, excluding any voids or holes. 

Assuming that the figure is constructed by connecting the large sectors and small sectors in such a way that the total area is the sum of the large sectors minus the small ones, or vice versa. 

Alternatively, maybe the entire figure is formed by the two large quarter-circles and the two small quarter-circles, creating a symmetrical design. For example, if you have two large quarter-circles joined by two smaller quarter-circles, forming a sort of flower petal shape. 

But without more information, perhaps the safest assumption is that the metal plate base is the area of the two large sectors minus the areas of the small sectors. Or perhaps the other way around. 

Wait, let's think about the points. For example, the sector O1AB is a quarter-circle with radius 6. Point E is inside this quarter-circle, since it's connected to A and O1. So, if the metal plate base is the area covered by the metal, it might exclude the smaller sectors, implying that the area is the large sectors minus the small ones. 

Alternatively, maybe the small sectors are part of the metal plate. 

Given the ambiguity, perhaps we need to find the total area of all the sectors, assuming they don't overlap. But this might not be accurate. 

Alternatively, let's think about the fact that the problem includes several equalities. For instance, the areas of Sector(O1,A,B) and Sector(O2,C,D) are equal, and the areas of Sector(E,A,O1) and Sector(F,C,O2) are equal. This suggests that the total area might be twice the area of each pair. 

But if we assume that the metal plate base is the sum of all these sectors, then total area would be 2*(9π + 9/4 π) = 2*( (36/4 + 9/4 )π ) = 2*(45/4 π) = 45/2 π = 22.5π. 

But let's calculate this numerically. π is approximately 3.1416, so 22.5 * π ≈ 70.6858. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 70.69. 

But wait, let me confirm the calculation:

Each large sector area: 9π (each).

Two large sectors: 18π.

Each small sector: (9/4)π. Two small sectors: (9/2)π.

Total: 18π + 4.5π = 22.5π ≈ 70.69.

But is this the correct approach? 

Alternatively, perhaps the metal plate base is the area of the two large sectors minus the areas of the small sectors, giving 18π - 4.5π = 13.5π ≈ 42.41. 

Or maybe the small sectors are part of the metal plate, so adding them. 

Without further information, it's challenging. However, given that the problem mentions "gold plated wire running around the outside," it's possible that the metal plate base is the area enclosed by the outer perimeter, which would be the two large sectors combined, while the small sectors are the parts that are outlined by the gold wire. 

Alternatively, the entire figure is made up of the two large sectors and the two small sectors, and the area covered by the metal plate is the total area of these sectors. 

But I need to make an educated guess here. Considering that the problem gives us equalities between areas of sectors, and the question is about the area of the metal plate base, which is likely the total area of all the sectors involved. 

Thus, proceeding with the total area being 22.5π. Converting this into numerical terms: π ≈ 3.1416, so 22.5 × 3.1416 ≈ 70.6858. Rounded to two decimal places, that's 70.69. 

But let me check if there's another approach. Let me think about the possibility that the metal plate base is the area of the two large sectors minus the areas of the small sectors. Why? Because the small sectors might represent the parts that are connected by the gold wire, hence not part of the metal plate. 

Alternatively, think of it as follows: the gold wire outlines the entire figure, which includes the outer perimeters of the large sectors and the inner perimeters of the small sectors. Hence, the metal plate base would be the area enclosed by the large sectors, excluding the small sectors. 

In that case, the area would be 18π - 4.5π = 13.5π ≈ 42.41. 

But how to decide between these options? 

Let me recall that the problem says the metal plate is the base, and the gold wire is around the outside. If the small sectors are attached to the large ones, then the metal plate base would include the small sectors. But if the small sectors are cutouts, then it would exclude them. 

Alternatively, consider that the sectors EAO1 and FCO2 are parts of the metal plate, as they are described as sectors, not holes. 

Given that the problem includes all these sectors as part of the construction, it's possible that the total area is the sum of all sectors. 

But to ensure correctness, let's think about the number of sectors. There are four sectors: two large ones (O1AB and O2CD) and two small ones (EAO1 and FCO2). Assuming they are all part of the metal plate base, the total area would be 9π + 9π + 9/4 π + 9/4 π = 18π + 9/2 π = (36/2 + 9/2)π = 45/2 π = 22.5π, as before. 

Alternatively, if the figure is designed such that the small sectors are parts of the gold wire, then the metal plate area would be the large sectors only. But that would give 18π ≈ 56.55. 

But how to choose? 

Let me think about the positions of points E and F. They are connected to O1 and O2 respectively. If the metal plate base includes these connections, then the small sectors are part of the base. 

Alternatively, since the gold wire runs around the outside, it might outline the entire figure, which includes the outer parts of the large sectors and the inner parts of the small sectors. So, the metal plate base would be the area enclosed by the entire figure, including all sectors. 

In that case, the total area would be the sum of all sectors. 

But I'm still uncertain. Let me try to think of the problem in terms of the given areas. 

The problem gives that the area of Sector(O1,A,B) equals the area of Sector(O2,C,D), and similarly for the other pair. This suggests symmetry. If the metal plate base is the union of all these sectors, then the total area would be double the area of each pair. 

Since there are two pairs of equal-area sectors, each pair having total area of 9π + 9/4 π = 45/4 π. Total for both pairs: 45/2 π = 22.5π. 

Thus, I'll proceed with this value. 

Calculating 22.5π numerically: 

π ≈ 3.1415926535

22.5 * π ≈ 22.5 * 3.1415926535 ≈ 70.6858347...

Rounded to two decimal places: 70.69. 

But let me confirm once again. Are there any other areas to consider? 

No, the problem mentions only these four sectors. Therefore, the total area covered by the metal plate base would be the sum of these four sectors. 

Hence, the final answer is 22.5π, which is approximately 70.69 when rounded to two decimal places. 

Alternatively, maybe there's another factor. Let me check if any of the sectors overlap or if any areas are counted multiple times. 

For example, if the small sectors are entirely within the large sectors, then adding their areas would count overlapping regions twice. But without knowing the exact configuration, it's impossible to say. 

However, given that the problem provides all these sectors as separate entities, and doesn't mention any overlaps, it's reasonable to assume that they are distinct and non-overlapping, thus allowing their areas to be summed. 

Therefore, the final answer is 22.5π, which is approximately 70.69. 

But let me check if the question expects a numerical value instead of an expression with π. The problem says to provide the answer correct to two decimal places, so it's expecting a numerical value. 

Thus, 22.5π ≈ 70.6858..., which rounds to 70.69. 

Yes, that seems correct.

### **Step 1: Parsing the Predicates**

From the given information:

- **Points**: A, B, C, D, E, F, O₁, O₂.
- **Sectors**:
  - `Sector(O₁, A, B)` and `Sector(O₂, C, D)` — both are **quarter-circles** with radius 6 and central angle 90°.
  - `Sector(E, A, O₁)` and `Sector(F, C, O₂)` — both are **quarter-circles** with radius 3 and central angle 90°.
- **Equal Radii**:
  - O₁A = O₁B = 6 ⇒ Radius of the large sectors.
  - EA = EO₁ = 3 ⇒ Radius of the small sectors.
- **Angles**:
  - All central angles are **right angles (90°)**.
- **Area Equality**:
  - Area of `Sector(O₁, A, B)` = Area of `Sector(O₂, C, D)`
  - Area of `Sector(E, A, O₁)` = Area of `Sector(F, C, O₂)`

### **Step 2: Computing Sector Areas**

#### **Large Sectors** (`Sector(O₁, A, B)` and `Sector(O₂, C, D)`):
These are **quarter-circles** with radius $ r = 6 $ and angle $ \theta = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} $ radians.

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{large}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \pi \cdot r^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \pi \cdot 6^2 = 9\pi
$$

There are two such sectors:

$$
\text{Total Large Area} = 2 \times 9\pi = 18\pi
$$

#### **Small Sectors** (`Sector(E, A, O₁)` and `Sector(F, C, O₂)`):
These are **quarter-circles** with radius $ r = 3 $ and angle $ \theta = 90^\circ = \frac{\pi}{2} $ radians.

$$
\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \pi \cdot r^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \pi \cdot 3^2 = \frac{9}{4}\pi
$$

There are two such sectors:

$$
\text{Total Small Area} = 2 \times \frac{9}{4}\pi = \frac{9}{2}\pi
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total Metal Plate Base Area**

Assuming the **metal plate base** encompasses **all four sectors** (as implied by the symmetry and absence of explicit exclusion), the total area is the sum of all individual sector areas:

$$
\text{Total Area} = 18\pi + \frac{9}{2}\pi = \left(18 + 4.5\right)\pi = 22.5\pi
$$

Converting to a numerical value:

$$
22.5\pi \approx 22.5 \times 3.1415926535 \approx 70.6858
$$

Rounding to two decimal places:

$$
\boxed{70.69}
$$
