QUESTION:
A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm. We wish to find the surface area of the entire solid. Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object.
What is the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism? Give your answer correct to two decimal places.

<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, we have a solid made up of a cylinder attached to a rectangular prism. The question is asking for the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism. Hmm, right. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to recall the formulas for surface areas of both shapes. But since they are combined, some areas will be covered where they are attached, so those won't be exposed anymore. 

The rectangular prism has dimensions 21mm, 10mm, and 65mm. Wait, but which face is the cylinder attached to? The problem says "attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces." Looking back at the given data, there's mention of Rectangle(A,B,C,D) with LengthOf(Line(A,B),65), LengthOf(Line(B,C),21), and HeightOf(Rectangle(A,B,C,D),10). Wait, maybe that's the prism's dimensions? Let me think. 

Wait, rectangles in 3D... A rectangle as a face of a prism. So, the rectangular prism has three dimensions: length, width, height. The problem mentions that the prism has sides of lengths 21mm, 10mm, and 65mm. But which one corresponds to which dimension?

But then there's also a Cylinder(2) with Radius 5mm and Height 11mm. The cylinder is attached to the prism on one of its faces. The height of the cylinder is 11mm. Also, the height of the rectangle (prism?) is given as 10mm. Wait, maybe the height of the prism is 10mm? Let me check again.

Original problem statement:

"A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm."

So, the prism has three dimensions: 21, 10, 65. So, the three sides are 21, 10, and 65 mm. Now, when attaching the cylinder to the prism, the cylinder is attached to one of the faces of the prism. Therefore, the base of the cylinder (which is a circle) must fit onto one of the faces of the prism. Since the cylinder's radius is 5mm, the diameter is 10mm. That suggests that the face of the prism where the cylinder is attached must have one side equal to the diameter of the cylinder. Because otherwise, the cylinder wouldn't fit perfectly.

Looking at the prism's sides: 21, 10, 65. If the cylinder is attached to a face, then that face would be a rectangle. The diameter of the cylinder is 10mm, so the face where it's attached must have one side equal to 10mm. So, looking at the prism's dimensions, one of the sides is 10mm. Let me think about which face that could be.

Assuming that the prism has dimensions length=65, width=21, height=10. Then, the faces would be:

- Two faces of 65x21 (the largest ones),
- Two faces of 65x10,
- Two faces of 21x10.

Since the cylinder's diameter is 10mm, so the face that the cylinder is attached to must be either 65x10 or 21x10. However, the cylinder's height is 11mm. Wait, the cylinder's height is 11mm. But the height of the prism is 10mm. Maybe the cylinder is attached along the height of the prism? Or perhaps the height of the cylinder is aligned with one of the prism's edges?

Wait, maybe the cylinder is attached such that its circular face is glued to one of the prism's faces. For example, if the prism has a face with dimensions 21mm by 10mm, then the cylinder's base (diameter 10mm) can fit on that face. Then, the height of the cylinder (11mm) would extend outward from the prism. Alternatively, if the cylinder is attached to a face with dimensions 65mm by 10mm, then the same logic applies.

But the problem says that the cylinder is attached to the prism on one of its faces. So, the face where they are joined must have an area that matches the base of the cylinder. The base of the cylinder is a circle with diameter 10mm (radius 5mm). But the face of the prism is a rectangle. Therefore, the only way the cylinder can attach to the prism is if the rectangle has one side equal to the diameter of the cylinder, i.e., 10mm. Hence, the face where the cylinder is attached must be a rectangle with one side 10mm. So among the prism's dimensions, which face has a 10mm side?

The prism's sides are 21, 10, and 65. So, possible faces are:

- 65 x 21
- 65 x 10
- 21 x 10

Therefore, the cylinder is attached to a face that is either 65x10 or 21x10. Which one? Well, the height of the cylinder is 11mm. But maybe that doesn't affect the attachment. The key thing is that the area where they are joined is the base of the cylinder. But since the cylinder is attached to the prism, the area of the base of the cylinder (πr²) is covered, so that part isn't exposed anymore.

But the question specifically asks for the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism. So, we need to calculate the total surface area of the prism, subtract the area that is covered by the cylinder, and then add any additional surfaces that might be affected? Wait, no—since the cylinder is attached to the prism, the surface area of the prism that's covered by the cylinder is removed. Additionally, the cylinder itself adds its own surface area except for the base that's attached to the prism. But wait, the question is only about the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism. So, we don't consider the cylinder's surface area here. Wait, let me re-read the question.

"Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object."

So, the problem wants the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism. That means, compute the original surface area of the prism, minus the area that is covered by the cylinder. Because where the cylinder is attached, part of the prism's surface is covered.

So first, compute the total surface area of the rectangular prism.

For a rectangular prism, the surface area is 2(lw + lh + wh), where l, w, h are length, width, height.

But we need to make sure which dimensions correspond to which. Let me assume that the prism's dimensions are length=65, width=21, height=10. Then:

SA_prism = 2*(65*21 + 65*10 + 21*10)

Let me compute that:

First, compute each term:

65*21: 65*20=1300, plus 65*1=65 → 1365

65*10 = 650

21*10 = 210

Sum these: 1365 + 650 = 2015; 2015 + 210 = 2225

Multiply by 2: 2225 * 2 = 4450 mm²

So total surface area of prism is 4450 mm².

Now, the cylinder is attached to one of the faces. As discussed earlier, the face must be a rectangle with one side equal to 10mm (the diameter of the cylinder). So, which face is that?

If the prism's dimensions are 65, 21, 10, then the possible faces with a 10mm side are:

Either 65x10 or 21x10. So, the cylinder is attached to one of these two faces.

But which one? The problem mentions that the height of the cylinder is 11mm. Wait, does that matter? Let me think. The height of the cylinder is 11mm. If the cylinder is attached to the prism, then the height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the face of the prism. Therefore, the height of the cylinder (11mm) would be extending away from the prism. However, the height of the prism is 10mm. So, perhaps the cylinder is attached to the 21x10 face? Or maybe the 65x10 face?

Alternatively, maybe the height of the prism is 10mm, which is the same as the diameter of the cylinder. So, the cylinder is attached to the top face of the prism? Wait, but the prism's height is 10mm, which equals the diameter of the cylinder. So, if the cylinder is attached to the top face of the prism, then the base of the cylinder (with diameter 10mm) would fit exactly into the top face of the prism. Wait, but the top face of the prism would be a rectangle with dimensions length and width. For instance, if the prism's height is 10mm, then the top face is 65x21. But that's larger than the diameter of the cylinder (10mm). So that can't fit. Therefore, the face where the cylinder is attached must be a smaller face.

Ah! So, the face that the cylinder is attached to must be one of the 65x10 or 21x10 faces. Let me think. Suppose the cylinder is attached to the 21x10 face. Then, the cylinder's diameter is 10mm, which matches the 10mm side of that face. So, the cylinder is sitting on that face. Similarly, if it's attached to the 65x10 face, same idea.

However, the problem states that the height of the cylinder is 11mm. So, the height of the cylinder is 11mm. This implies that the axis of the cylinder is perpendicular to the face it's attached to. So, if the cylinder is attached to the 21x10 face, then the height of the cylinder (11mm) extends outward from that face. Similarly, if attached to the 65x10 face, same thing.

But the problem doesn't specify where the cylinder is attached. However, since the problem gives us specific information about the rectangle (A,B,C,D) with certain lengths. Let me check that again.

In the initial problem description, there's a Rectangle(A,B,C,D) with LengthOf(Line(A,B)=65), LengthOf(Line(B,C)=21), and HeightOf(Rectangle(A,B,C,D)=10). Wait, but that seems like a 2D rectangle. So, if we consider the rectangle ABCD, then AB is length 65, BC is length 21, and the height of the rectangle is 10? Wait, maybe that's a typo or misunderstanding. Wait, in 2D, a rectangle has length and width. The height might refer to one of the sides. Wait, maybe the rectangle ABCD is a 2D shape, and the height refers to one of the sides. Let me parse that again.

Original problem says:

Rectangle(A,B,C,D)
LengthOf(Line(A,B),65)
LengthOf(Line(B,C),21)
HeightOf(Rectangle(A,B,C,D),10)

Wait, this seems conflicting because in a rectangle, adjacent sides are length and width. So, Line(A,B) is one side, Line(B,C) is another. So, if AB is 65, BC is 21, then the rectangle has sides 65 and 21. But then why is the height of the rectangle given as 10? That seems inconsistent. Unless there's a mistake in the problem setup. Alternatively, maybe the HeightOf(Rectangle(...)) refers to something else. Perhaps the height is referring to the vertical side? But if AB is horizontal, then BC would be vertical. So, if AB is 65, BC is 21, then the height of the rectangle would be 21? But the problem says HeightOf(...) is 10. There's inconsistency here. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem setup, but perhaps it's intended that the rectangle has sides 65 and 21, and the height is 10? That doesn't match. Wait, perhaps the problem is using different terms. Maybe "height" refers to the vertical side, but if the rectangle is drawn with AB and BC as adjacent sides, then depending on orientation, the height could be BC. But the problem says HeightOf(Rectangle(A,B,C,D),10). So that would mean that BC is 10? But the problem says LengthOf(Line(B,C),21). So that contradicts. Therefore, there might be a mistake here. But perhaps the problem is using non-standard terminology. Alternatively, maybe the rectangle is not a standard rectangle, but part of a 3D object?

Wait, maybe the rectangle ABCD is actually a face of the rectangular prism. In that case, the rectangle's sides would be two of the prism's dimensions. For example, if the prism has length=65, width=21, and height=10, then the face ABCD could be a 65x21 face. But then the height of the rectangle being 10 would refer to the third dimension? Not sure. Maybe there's confusion in the problem's wording.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is trying to say that the rectangle has length 65, width 21, and height 10, but that doesn't make sense for a rectangle. Rectangles are 2D figures. So maybe the problem is mixing 2D and 3D concepts. Given that, maybe the problem is using "rectangle" to refer to a face of the prism. So, the face ABCD is a 65x21 rectangle, and the height of the prism is 10. Therefore, the prism's dimensions are 65, 21, and 10. Thus, the three dimensions of the prism are 65, 21, and 10. Therefore, the surface area calculations proceed as before.

So, assuming that the prism has dimensions 65, 21, and 10. Then, the surface area of the prism is 2*(lw + lh + wh) = 2*(65*21 + 65*10 + 21*10) = 4450 mm² as calculated earlier.

Now, the cylinder is attached to one of the faces. The cylinder has radius 5mm (so diameter 10mm) and height 11mm. The face where the cylinder is attached must have a side equal to the diameter of the cylinder (10mm). So, looking at the prism's faces:

- Faces with dimensions 65x21: These are large faces. They cannot accommodate a 10mm diameter cylinder since their sides are longer than 10mm.

- Faces with dimensions 65x10: One side is 65, the other is 10. So, the 10mm side could be used. The diameter of the cylinder is 10mm, so the cylinder can be attached to this face. Similarly, the faces with dimensions 21x10: one side is 21, the other is 10. Again, the 10mm side can accommodate the cylinder's diameter.

So, the cylinder is attached to either the 65x10 face or the 21x10 face. How do we know which one? The problem mentions that the height of the cylinder is 11mm. If the cylinder is attached to the 21x10 face, then the height of the cylinder would extend in the direction perpendicular to the face. But the height of the cylinder is 11mm, which is more than the height of the prism (which is 10mm). Wait, but the prism's height is 10mm. So, if the cylinder is attached to the top face of the prism, then the height of the cylinder would stick out from the prism. But the prism's height is already 10mm. However, the problem says that the prism has sides of length 21, 10, and 65. So, the height of the prism is 10mm. So, if the cylinder is attached to the top face of the prism, then the cylinder's height would be 11mm. But that would mean that the cylinder extends beyond the prism's height. But that's allowed. However, the problem doesn't specify where the cylinder is attached, so maybe we need to infer based on the given data.

Wait, the problem says that the rectangle (A,B,C,D) has height 10. Earlier, the problem had a Rectangle(A,B,C,D) with LengthOf(Line(A,B),65), LengthOf(Line(B,C),21), and HeightOf(Rectangle(A,B,C,D),10). So, perhaps that rectangle is one of the faces of the prism. If AB is 65, BC is 21, and the height of the rectangle is 10, that suggests that the rectangle's height is 10. Wait, but in a rectangle, the height is usually the vertical side. If AB and BC are adjacent sides, then if AB is horizontal, BC would be vertical. So, if AB is 65, BC is 21, then the height of the rectangle would be 21. But the problem says it's 10. Contradiction. Therefore, there must be a misinterpretation here.

Perhaps the problem uses "height" to refer to the vertical side, regardless of labeling. Maybe the rectangle ABCD is oriented such that AB is horizontal with length 65, BC is vertical with length 10, making the height of the rectangle 10. But then the problem says LengthOf(Line(B,C),21). So, that conflicts. Therefore, there is a contradiction in the problem's initial statements. But maybe it's a translation error or typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem meant that the rectangle has length 65, width 21, and height 10, meaning that it's part of a 3D object. 

Alternatively, perhaps the rectangle is not a face of the prism but just a separate entity. The problem says:

"Rectangle(A,B,C,D)
LengthOf(Line(A,B),65)
LengthOf(Line(B,C),21)
HeightOf(Rectangle(A,B,C,D),10)"

Then later:

"Rectangle(1)
LengthOf(Rectangle(1),65)
WidthOf(Rectangle(1),21)
HeightOf(Rectangle(1),10)"

So, the first Rectangle(A,B,C,D) probably defines a rectangle with sides AB=65, BC=21, and height=10. But this seems confusing. Maybe "height" refers to the third dimension? Or perhaps it's a mistake. Regardless, moving forward, the problem states that the rectangular prism has sides of length 21, 10, and 65. So, we'll take that as given. 

Thus, the prism has dimensions 21, 10, and 65. Let me confirm once again. The problem says:

"The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm."

Yes, so the three dimensions are 21, 10, and 65. So, the prism is a cuboid with length, width, height of 21, 10, and 65. Now, the cylinder is attached to one of its faces. The base of the cylinder has diameter 10mm, so the face where it is attached must have a side of 10mm. So, which face? The faces are:

- 21x10 (area 210)
- 21x65 (area 1365)
- 10x65 (area 650)

Therefore, the cylinder is attached to either the 21x10 face or the 10x65 face. Now, the height of the cylinder is 11mm. Since the cylinder is attached to the prism, the height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the face it's attached to. So, if it's attached to the 21x10 face, then the height of the cylinder extends in the direction perpendicular to that face. Similarly for the other face.

But since the problem doesn't specify where the cylinder is attached, but we need to calculate the exposed surface area of the prism, which depends on which face is chosen. Wait, but maybe there's a clue in the problem's initial description. Let me check again.

The problem includes a Rectangle(1) with LengthOf(Rectangle(1),65), WidthOf(Rectangle(1),21), HeightOf(Rectangle(1),10). Wait, that's confusing because a rectangle is 2D. Maybe that's a mistake, and they meant a rectangular prism. If Rectangle(1) is supposed to represent the prism, then its dimensions would be length 65, width 21, height 10. So, that aligns with the prism having dimensions 65, 21, 10. So, the prism has length 65, width 21, height 10. Therefore, the faces are:

- Front/back: 65x10 (area 650)
- Left/right: 21x10 (area 210)
- Top/bottom: 65x21 (area 1365)

Therefore, the cylinder is attached to one of these faces. Since the cylinder's base has diameter 10mm, which matches the left/right faces (21x10) or front/back faces (65x10). 

But the problem says that the cylinder has a height of 11mm. If the cylinder is attached to the front/back face (65x10), then the height of the cylinder (11mm) would extend outward from that face. Similarly, if attached to the left/right face (21x10), the height would extend outward. 

However, the problem doesn't specify where the cylinder is attached. But since the problem provides a rectangle with height 10, which may correspond to the height of the prism, which is 10mm. So, if the cylinder is attached to the top face of the prism, which would be a 65x21 face, but that doesn't match the diameter. So, the cylinder must be attached to either the 65x10 or 21x10 face. 

But without further info, maybe we need to assume that the cylinder is attached to the face with the smallest dimension? Or maybe the problem expects that the height of the cylinder is aligned with the height of the prism. Wait, the height of the prism is 10mm, which is the same as the diameter of the cylinder. So, if the cylinder is attached to the top face of the prism, which has dimensions 65x21, then the cylinder's base would have to fit into that face. But the diameter is 10mm, which is less than 21 and 65. So, that's possible. However, the base of the cylinder would occupy a portion of the top face. But that's not matching the previous assumption. 

Wait, maybe the cylinder is attached to the side of the prism, such that its height is aligned with the prism's height. For example, suppose the prism's height is 10mm. If the cylinder is attached to the side, then the cylinder's height (11mm) is perpendicular to the prism's height. But this is getting too vague. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the cylinder is attached to the face with the 10mm side, which is the same as the height of the prism. So, the height of the prism is 10mm, and the cylinder's diameter is also 10mm. Therefore, the cylinder is attached to the top face of the prism. Wait, but the top face of the prism is 65x21, which doesn't have a 10mm side. So, that doesn't work. 

This is confusing. Maybe I should proceed under the assumption that the cylinder is attached to the 21x10 face. Let's go with that. So, the face where the cylinder is attached has dimensions 21x10. The cylinder's base has diameter 10mm, so it fits exactly along the 10mm side. 

Therefore, when calculating the exposed surface area of the prism, we need to subtract the area of the base of the cylinder from the prism's total surface area. Because where the cylinder is attached, the prism loses that area. 

So, the area of the base of the cylinder is πr² = π*(5)^2 = 25π mm². 

So, total exposed surface area of the prism = Total SA of prism - area covered by cylinder = 4450 - 25π. 

But wait, is that all? Or is there anything else? Because when you attach the cylinder to the prism, not only does the base of the cylinder cover part of the prism's face, but also, the rest of the prism's surface remains exposed. So yes, that's it. 

But hold on, the problem says "exposed surface area of the rectangular prism". So, even though the cylinder is attached, the rest of the prism's surfaces remain exposed. Therefore, the calculation is total SA of prism minus the area where the cylinder is attached (i.e., the area of the base of the cylinder). 

But let me verify with an example. Imagine a cube with a cylinder attached to one face. The total surface area of the cube is 6a². When you attach the cylinder, you lose the area of the base of the cylinder (since it's covered), so the new surface area of the cube is 6a² - area_of_cylinder_base. The cylinder itself contributes its lateral surface area, but since the question is only about the prism's exposed surface area, we don't include the cylinder's SA. 

Therefore, in our case, the exposed surface area of the prism is total SA of prism minus the area of the cylinder's base. 

So, proceeding with that:

Total SA of prism = 4450 mm²

Area covered by cylinder = π*(5)^2 = 25π ≈ 78.54 mm²

Therefore, exposed SA of prism = 4450 - 25π ≈ 4450 - 78.54 = 4371.46 mm²

But wait, let me check if the area covered is indeed the full base of the cylinder. Suppose the cylinder is attached to the prism such that its base is entirely covering a part of the prism's face. However, if the cylinder is attached to the middle of the face, then only the area of the base is covered. But if the cylinder is attached to the edge, maybe it covers more? No, the problem says "attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces", implying that the entire base of the cylinder is glued to the face. Therefore, the area covered is exactly the area of the base of the cylinder, which is πr². 

But let me think again. Suppose the cylinder is attached to the prism's face. The base of the cylinder is a circle with area πr². However, the face of the prism is a rectangle. So, the area of the prism's face that is covered is equal to the area of the circle. Therefore, the total SA of the prism is reduced by πr². 

Hence, the calculation is correct. 

But wait, the problem says "exposed surface area of the rectangular prism". So, the answer would be 4450 - 25π. But let me compute that numerically. 

Compute 25π: π ≈ 3.1416, so 25 * 3.1416 ≈ 78.54 mm².

Thus, 4450 - 78.54 = 4371.46 mm². Rounded to two decimal places, that's 4371.46 mm². 

But wait, let me check if there are any other areas that are covered. For example, when attaching the cylinder, does the cylinder block any other parts of the prism? Like, if the cylinder is attached to the side of the prism, does it cover any other areas? No, because the cylinder is only attached to one face. The rest of the prism's surface is still exposed. Therefore, the only reduction is the area of the base of the cylinder. 

But let me double-check by considering the actual dimensions. The prism has a face of 21x10 mm. The cylinder has a diameter of 10mm. So, if the cylinder is attached to the 21x10 face, then the cylinder's base is a circle of diameter 10mm, fitting exactly along the 10mm side of the face. So, the area of the base is π*(5)^2 = 25π. 

Thus, the exposed surface area of the prism is 4450 - 25π ≈ 4450 - 78.54 ≈ 4371.46 mm². 

But wait, the problem says "correct to two decimal places". So, let me compute 25π precisely. 

π is approximately 3.1415926535...

25 * π = 78.53981634...

So, 4450 - 78.53981634 = 4371.46018366 mm². Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 4371.46 mm². 

But let me check whether I should consider the fact that the cylinder is attached to the prism, so the prism's surface area is reduced by the area of the base, but also, the lateral surface area of the cylinder is added. Wait, no—the question is only about the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism. The cylinder's presence affects the prism's exposed area only by removing the area where they are attached. The rest of the prism's surfaces remain. Therefore, my calculation holds. 

However, let me think again. What if the cylinder is attached such that it protrudes from the prism, so that part of the prism's surface is still exposed? Yes, that's correct. Only the area where the cylinder is attached is covered. 

Another point to check: Is the height of the cylinder relevant? For example, if the cylinder were taller than the prism, would that affect anything? Probably not, since the question is about the prism's surface area. The height of the cylinder affects the total surface area of the composite shape, but since we're only concerned with the prism's exposed area, it doesn't matter. 

Thus, the final answer should be 4450 - 25π, which numerically is approximately 4371.46 mm². 

But wait, let me check if the prism's dimensions are correctly taken. Earlier, I assumed that the prism has dimensions 65, 21, 10. Let me confirm once again. 

Problem states: "The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm." So, yes, the three dimensions are 21, 10, and 65. 

Calculating the total surface area: 2*(65*21 + 65*10 + 21*10) = 2*(1365 + 650 + 210) = 2*(2225) = 4450 mm². Correct. 

Subtracting 25π gives 4450 - 25π ≈ 4371.46 mm². 

But wait, I just realized that the problem might have considered the height of the prism as 10mm, which was mentioned in the initial rectangle description. But in that case, if the prism's height is 10mm, then the cylinder's height is 11mm. So, if the cylinder is attached to the top face of the prism, which is a 65x21 face, but the base of the cylinder has diameter 10mm, which would require that the face has at least 10mm in one side. However, the top face is 65x21, so the diameter of 10mm can fit. Wait, but the cylinder is attached to the face, so the base of the cylinder is placed on the face. So, for example, imagine placing a cylinder on the top face of the prism. The base of the cylinder would be a circle of diameter 10mm, centered on the face. Therefore, the area of the prism's top face that is covered is π*5² = 25π. 

But in this scenario, the face where the cylinder is attached is the top face of the prism, which has dimensions 65x21. So, the area of the face is 65*21 = 1365 mm². The cylinder covers 25π mm² of it. So, the total exposed surface area of the prism would be total SA - 25π. 

So, regardless of which face the cylinder is attached to, as long as the base of the cylinder fits on the face, the area to subtract is 25π. Therefore, the answer is 4450 - 25π ≈ 4371.46 mm². 

But wait, is there another consideration? For example, if the cylinder is attached to the side of the prism, does it affect the surface area differently? For instance, if the cylinder is attached to the 65x10 face, then the area covered is still π*5², so same result. Therefore, regardless of which face the cylinder is attached to, the area subtracted is the same. 

Therefore, the final answer is 4450 - 25π, which evaluates to approximately 4371.46 mm². 

But let me check if the problem requires rounding. It says "Give your answer correct to two decimal places." So, 4450 - 25π ≈ 4450 - 78.5398 ≈ 4371.4602, which rounds to 4371.46. 

Thus, the final answer is 4371.46 mm². 

But wait, let me check if I made a mistake in the surface area calculation. Another way to think: the surface area of the prism is 2*(lwh) + ... Wait no, the formula is 2(lw + lh + wh). 

With l=65, w=21, h=10:

2*(65*21 + 65*10 + 21*10) = 2*(1365 + 650 + 210) = 2*(2225) = 4450. Correct. 

Yes, so that's accurate. 

Another thought: Could there be overlapping areas on other faces? For example, if the cylinder is attached to the top face, does it affect the sides? No, because the cylinder is attached only to one face. Its presence doesn't cover any other parts of the prism. 

Therefore, the calculation is correct. 

Final Answer: 4450 - 25π ≈ 4371.46 mm². Rounded to two decimal places, it's 4371.46. 

But let me check the numerical value once more:

Calculate 25π:

π ≈ 3.1415926535

25 × π ≈ 78.53981634

Then, 4450 - 78.53981634 = 4371.46018366... So, rounded to two decimals: 4371.46.

Yes. 

So, the final answer is 4371.46 mm². 

**Final Answer**
\boxed{4371.
