QUESTION:
Find the volume of the cone shown. The perpendicular height is 6 centimeters and radius is 2 centimeters.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, so I need to find the volume of a cone where the perpendicular height is 6 cm and the radius is 2 cm. Let me start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cone. From what I remember, the volume V of a cone is given by (1/3)πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. 

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing it up with the formula for a cylinder. Yeah, cones have one-third the volume of a cylinder with the same base and height. So the formula should definitely be (1/3)πr²h. 

Now, looking at the problem, they've given me the radius as 2 cm and the height as 6 cm. Let me plug those numbers into the formula. First, calculate the square of the radius: 2 squared is 4. Then multiply that by the height, which is 6. So 4 times 6 equals 24. Then multiply by π, giving 24π. Finally, multiply by 1/3, so 24 divided by 3 is 8. Therefore, the volume should be 8π cubic centimeters. 

But wait, the question says to round to two decimal places. Hmm, π is approximately 3.1416, so multiplying 8 by π gives about 25.1328... Rounded to two decimal places, that would be 25.13 cm³. But hold on, maybe I should check if there's any other step where rounding is required. Let me verify each part again.

The radius is 2 cm, so r² is 4. Height is 6 cm. Multiplying them gives 24. Then divide by 3: 24 / 3 = 8. Multiply by π: 8π. Since the problem mentions rounding to two decimal places, I need to compute 8π numerically. Using π ≈ 3.1415926535, 8*3.1415926535 is approximately 25.132741228. Rounding to two decimal places: look at the third decimal place, which is 2. Since it's less than 5, we keep the second decimal as is. So 25.13 cm³. 

Wait, but sometimes different approximations for π might give slightly different results. However, since the problem specifies to round to two decimal places, regardless of the approximation method, the correct value would be 25.13. Let me confirm once more. Yes, 8π is approximately 25.1327, so rounded to two decimals, it's 25.13. 

I think that's all. There's no mention of needing to use any specific geometric theorems here because the problem directly gives the radius and height, so the formula applies straightforwardly. No need to involve circles or other shapes beyond the cone itself. The key was just applying the formula correctly and performing the arithmetic accurately.
