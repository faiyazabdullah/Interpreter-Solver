QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $(1,1.5)$ and an amplitude of 1.5. What is the midline equation of the function?

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about finding the midline equation of a trigonometric function. The given information includes a minimum point at (1, 1.5) and an amplitude of 1.5. Hmm, I need to recall how these elements relate to the midline.

First, I remember that for trigonometric functions like sine or cosine, the general form is something like y = A sin(Bx + C) + D or y = A cos(Bx + C) + D. Here, A is the amplitude, which affects the vertical stretch, B relates to the period, C is the horizontal shift, and D is the vertical shift. The midline is the horizontal line around which the function oscillates. That should be y = D, right? Because the midline is the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function.

Wait, the amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum. So if the amplitude is 1.5, then the maximum value would be D + A and the minimum would be D - A. But here, we're given a minimum point at (1, 1.5). Let me note that down: the minimum y-value is 1.5. Since amplitude is 1.5, then the maximum y-value should be 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0? Wait, no, hold on. Let me think again.

The amplitude is the absolute value of A, so if the amplitude is 1.5, then the maximum and minimum values are D + A and D - A. But since the minimum is given as 1.5, then D - A = 1.5. Also, the maximum would be D + A. However, without knowing the maximum, maybe there's another way. Alternatively, since the midline is halfway between the maximum and minimum. So midline y-coordinate is (maximum + minimum)/2. 

But wait, we know the amplitude is 1.5, which is half the distance between max and min. So the difference between max and min is 2*A = 3.0. Therefore, if the minimum is 1.5, then the maximum would be 1.5 + 3.0 = 4.5? Wait, but that seems conflicting. Let me check again.

Let me denote the midline as y = k. Then, the amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum. So, if the minimum is at y = 1.5, then k - amplitude = minimum value. Wait, no. If the midline is y = k, then the maximum is k + amplitude, and the minimum is k - amplitude. Therefore, given that the minimum is 1.5, then k - amplitude = 1.5. We also know the amplitude is 1.5. So substituting, k - 1.5 = 1.5. Solving for k gives k = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0. Therefore, the midline is y = 3.0. Wait, but that seems straightforward. Let me verify.

Alternatively, suppose the function has a minimum at (1, 1.5), so the lowest point is y=1.5. The amplitude is 1.5, meaning it goes up and down by 1.5 units from the midline. So, the maximum value would be midline value plus 1.5. But since the minimum is midline minus 1.5. So, if the minimum is 1.5, then midline = minimum + amplitude = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.0. Yes, that makes sense. So the midline is y = 3.0.

Therefore, the equation of the midline is y = 3. But wait, does the x-coordinate matter here? The problem mentions the minimum point is at (1, 1.5). But the midline is a horizontal line, so its equation is just y equals some constant. The x-coordinate of the minimum doesn't affect the midline's equation because the midline is horizontal. So regardless of where the minimum occurs horizontally, the midline is determined by the vertical shift. Hence, the midline equation is y = 3. 

So putting this together, the answer should be y = 3. Let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Amplitude is 1.5, minimum is 1.5. Midline is average of max and min. Max is min + 2*amplitude? Wait, no. Wait, amplitude is half the distance between max and min. So the total distance between max and min is 2*amplitude. Therefore, if the minimum is 1.5, then the maximum is 1.5 + 2*1.5 = 1.5 + 3 = 4.5. Then the midline is (max + min)/2 = (4.5 + 1.5)/2 = 6/2 = 3. Yep, same result. So the midline is y = 3. 

Therefore, the midline equation is y = 3. So the answer should be written as y = 3, which in boxed form is \boxed{y = 3}.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### STEP 1: PREDICATE ANALYSIS AND SETUP  
We are given:  
- A point `A` with coordinates `(1, 1.5)`  
- The function has a **minimum point** at `(1, 1.5)`  
- The **amplitude** of the function is **1.5**  

This defines a trigonometric function (likely sinusoidal), with the following key features:  
- Minimum value: `1.5`  
- Amplitude: `1.5`  
- The midline is the horizontal line equidistant from the maximum and minimum values of the function.

### STEP 2: CONSTRAINT SYNTHESIS  
From standard trigonometric function theory:  
For a function of the form:  
$$
y = A \sin(Bx + C) + D \quad \text{or} \quad y = A \cos(Bx + C) + D,
$$  
- **Amplitude**: $ |A| = 1.5 $  
- **Midline**: $ y = D $  
- **Maximum value**: $ D + |A| $  
- **Minimum value**: $ D - |A| $

Given that the **minimum value** is `1.5`, and the **amplitude** is `1.5`, we substitute into the formula for the minimum value:  
$$
D - |A| = 1.5
$$  
Substitute $ |A| = 1.5 $:  
$$
D - 1.5 = 1.5
$$  
Solving for $ D $:  
$$
D = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3
$$

Thus, the **midline** is the horizontal line defined by $ y = D $, i.e., $ y = 3 $.

### STEP 3: SOLUTION STRATEGY  
To find the midline equation:  
1. Recognize that the midline is the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function.  
2. Use the relationship:  
   $$
   \text{Midline} = \frac{\text{Maximum} + \text{Minimum}}{2}
   $$  
   Given the minimum is `1.5` and amplitude is `1.5`, the maximum is:  
   $$
   \text{Maximum} = \text{Minimum} + 2 \times \text{Amplitude} = 1.5 + 2(1.5) = 4.5
   $$  
   Compute midline:  
   $$
   \text{Midline} = \frac{4.5 + 1.5}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   $$

---

### STEP 4: MATHEMATICAL DERIVATION  
Using the formula for the midline:  
$$
\text{Midline} = \text{Minimum} + \text{Amplitude} = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3
$$  
Hence, the midline equation is:  
$$
y = 3
$$

---

### STEP 5: VERIFICATION AND FINAL ANSWER  
All steps align with the definition of midlines in trigonometry. The calculation confirms that the midline lies at a vertical distance of 1.5 above the minimum point, consistent with the given amplitude. This results in the midline being the horizontal line $ y = 3 $.

Final Answer: $ \boxed{y = 3} $
