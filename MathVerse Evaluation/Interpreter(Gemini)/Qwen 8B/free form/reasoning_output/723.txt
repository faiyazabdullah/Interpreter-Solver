Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked here. So, there's a cylindrical water tank with a height of 3x and a radius of 5x + 3. It's leaking at a constant rate of 3πx liters per second. Initially, the tank is full, and we need to find out how much water remains after (2x + 2)² seconds. 

Alright, so first things first, maybe I should compute the initial volume of the cylinder. Because if it's full, then the initial volume is just the volume formula for a cylinder, which is πr²h. Let me write that down.

The radius r is given as 5x + 3, and the height h is 3x. So plugging into the formula:

Volume_initial = π * (5x + 3)² * 3x.

Wait, but before I proceed, I need to make sure about the units. The problem mentions liters per second, so I guess the volume will be in liters, and time is in seconds. But since they don't give specific units for x, maybe x is just a variable here, and we can keep everything symbolic.

But actually, the question says "calculate the amount of water remaining after (2x + 2)^2 seconds". So we need to compute the total leakage over that time and subtract it from the initial volume.

So the leakage rate is 3πx liters per second. Therefore, over t seconds, the total leaked volume would be rate multiplied by time, which is 3πx * t. Here, t is (2x + 2)^2. Let me confirm that.

Yes, so total leakage = 3πx * (2x + 2)^2.

Therefore, the remaining volume is Initial Volume - Total Leakage.

So putting it all together:

Remaining Volume = π*(5x + 3)^2*3x - 3πx*(2x + 2)^2.

Hmm. Now, perhaps I need to simplify this expression. Let me expand each part step by step.

First, let me factor out common terms. Both terms have a πx, right? Let me check:

Original expression:

π*(5x + 3)^2 * 3x - 3πx*(2x + 2)^2.

Yes, both terms have 3πx. So factoring that out:

3πx [ (5x + 3)^2 - (2x + 2)^2 ].

That seems better. Then, I need to compute the difference of squares inside the brackets. Remember that a² - b² factors into (a - b)(a + b). So let's apply that.

Let me denote a = (5x + 3) and b = (2x + 2). Then,

(5x + 3)^2 - (2x + 2)^2 = [ (5x + 3) - (2x + 2) ] * [ (5x + 3) + (2x + 2) ]

Compute each bracket:

First bracket: (5x + 3) - (2x + 2) = 5x + 3 - 2x - 2 = 3x + 1.

Second bracket: (5x + 3) + (2x + 2) = 5x + 3 + 2x + 2 = 7x + 5.

So the entire expression becomes:

3πx * (3x + 1)(7x + 5).

Now, perhaps I need to multiply these two binomials (3x + 1)(7x + 5). Let me do that expansion.

Multiply term by term:

First: 3x * 7x = 21x²

Outer: 3x * 5 = 15x

Inner: 1 * 7x = 7x

Last: 1 * 5 = 5

Adding them up: 21x² + 15x + 7x + 5 = 21x² + 22x + 5.

So substituting back into the expression:

3πx*(21x² + 22x + 5)

Then, multiplying through:

3πx * 21x² = 63πx³

3πx * 22x = 66πx²

3πx * 5 = 15πx

So combining all terms:

Remaining Volume = 63πx³ + 66πx² + 15πx.

Alternatively, factored as 3πx(21x² + 22x + 5). However, the problem asks for the answer in expanded form. So expanding fully gives 63πx³ + 66πx² + 15πx.

Wait, but let me check my steps again to ensure no mistakes were made.

Starting from the beginning:

Initial Volume: π*(5x + 3)^2 * 3x.

Expanding (5x + 3)^2: 25x² + 30x + 9. Multiply by 3x: 3x*(25x² + 30x + 9) = 75x³ + 90x² + 27x. Then multiplied by π: π*(75x³ + 90x² + 27x).

Total leakage: 3πx*(2x + 2)^2. Let's compute (2x + 2)^2: 4x² + 8x + 4. Multiply by 3πx: 3πx*(4x² + 8x + 4) = 12πx³ + 24πx² + 12πx.

Subtracting total leakage from initial volume:

[75x³ + 90x² + 27x]π - [12x³ + 24x² + 12x]π = (75x³ - 12x³) + (90x² - 24x²) + (27x - 12x) all times π.

Which is 63x³ + 66x² + 15x times π. Which matches the earlier result. So that's correct.

Thus, the remaining volume is 63πx³ + 66πx² + 15πx. Alternatively, factoring 3πx, but since the question says "expanded form", probably needs to be written as individual terms.

But wait, the problem says "simplified answer in expanded form." So maybe they want it factored or not? Well, expanded usually means without parentheses, so yes, 63πx³ + 66πx² + 15πx.

Alternatively, maybe they want it in terms of factored form? Wait, the original expression after factoring was 3πx*(3x + 1)(7x + 5). But expanding that gives same as above. Since the problem says "expanded form," I think the polynomial form is expected.

So the answer is 63πx³ + 66πx² + 15πx. Let me check once more for any possible errors.

Another way: Maybe I made a mistake in computing the difference of squares?

Original expression: (5x + 3)^2 - (2x + 2)^2. Let me compute each square separately.

(5x + 3)^2 = 25x² + 30x + 9.

(2x + 2)^2 = 4x² + 8x + 4.

Subtracting: 25x² + 30x + 9 - 4x² -8x -4 = 21x² + 22x + 5. Correct.

Then multiply by 3πx: 3πx*(21x² + 22x +5) = 63πx³ + 66πx² + 15πx. Yes, that's correct.

So that's the simplified expanded form. Therefore, the answer is 63πx³ + 66πx² + 15πx.

But maybe we can factor πx? Like πx(63x² + 66x + 15). But the problem says "expanded form," so likely the former is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps they consider factored form as expanded? Hmm. But generally, expanded form refers to polynomials without parentheses, so I think the first version is correct.

Hence, the final answer is 63πx³ + 66πx² + 15πx. Let me check units. The problem says the rate is in liters per second, and time is in seconds, so the total leakage is in liters, and initial volume is also in liters. So the answer is in liters. But the problem doesn't specify units, so we can ignore units and just present the algebraic expression.

Therefore, Final Answer: $63\pi x^3 + 66\pi x^2 + 15\pi x$

To determine the amount of water remaining in the cylindrical tank after a certain period, we follow a structured approach based on the geometric properties and the given leak rate.

### **Step 1: Compute the Initial Volume**

The volume $ V $ of a cylinder is given by:

$$
V = \pi r^2 h
$$

We are told:
- The **radius** $ r = 5x + 3 $
- The **height** $ h = 3x $

Substituting into the formula:

$$
V_{\text{initial}} = \pi (5x + 3)^2 \cdot 3x
$$

Expand $ (5x + 3)^2 $:

$$
(5x + 3)^2 = 25x^2 + 30x + 9
$$

So,

$$
V_{\text{initial}} = \pi (25x^2 + 30x + 9) \cdot 3x = \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x)
$$

---

### **Step 2: Compute the Total Leaked Water**

The tank leaks at a constant rate of $ 3\pi x $ liters per second. Over a time duration of $ (2x + 2)^2 $ seconds, the total amount of water lost is:

$$
\text{Leakage} = 3\pi x \cdot (2x + 2)^2
$$

First, expand $ (2x + 2)^2 $:

$$
(2x + 2)^2 = 4x^2 + 8x + 4
$$

So,

$$
\text{Leakage} = 3\pi x (4x^2 + 8x + 4) = 12\pi x^3 + 24\pi x^2 + 12\pi x
$$

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the Leaked Volume from the Initial Volume**

$$
\text{Remaining Volume} = V_{\text{initial}} - \text{Leakage}
$$

$$
= \pi (75x^3 + 90x^2 + 27x) - (12\pi x^3 + 24\pi x^2 + 12\pi x)
$$

Distribute the subtraction across all terms:

$$
= \pi (75x^3 - 12x^3) + \pi (90x^2 - 24x^2) + \pi (27x - 12x)
$$

$$
= \pi (63x^3 + 66x^2 + 15x)
$$

---

### **Final Answer**

$$
\boxed{63\pi x^3 + 66\pi x^2 + 15\pi x}
$$
