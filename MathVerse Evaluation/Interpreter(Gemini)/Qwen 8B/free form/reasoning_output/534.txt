QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the amplitude of a trigonometric function given its maximum and minimum points. The maximum point is at (π/4, -2.2) and the minimum is at (3π/4, -8.5). Hmm, amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum, right? But first, I need to recall how the amplitude relates to the maximum and minimum values of a trigonometric function.

Wait, for a standard sine or cosine function, the general form is y = A sin(Bx + C) + D, where A is the amplitude, D is the vertical shift, and the midline is y = D. The maximum value would be D + |A| and the minimum would be D - |A|. So, if we have the maximum and minimum points, maybe we can find A by taking half the difference between the maximum and minimum values.

Let me check. The maximum y-value here is -2.2, and the minimum is -8.5. Wait, but those are both negative numbers. Let me think. If the maximum is higher than the minimum, even though they're both negative, the amplitude should still be half the distance between them. Because amplitude is about the "height" from the midline, regardless of direction.

So, the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values is (-2.2) - (-8.5) = -2.2 + 8.5 = 6.3. Then the amplitude would be half of that, so 6.3 / 2 = 3.15. Wait, but looking at the given predicates, there's an Equals(B,3.15) mentioned. That seems like it could be the amplitude. Let me verify.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The midline D would be the average of the maximum and minimum. Let me compute that. The average of -2.2 and -8.5 is (-2.2 + (-8.5)) / 2 = (-10.7)/2 = -5.35. So the midline is y = -5.35. Then the amplitude is the distance from the midline to the maximum, which is |-2.2 - (-5.35)| = |3.15| = 3.15. Yes, that matches. So the amplitude is 3.15.

Looking back at the given predicates, there's an Equals(B,3.15). Also, another predicate says Equals(A,Div(Sub(-2.2,-8.5),2)). Let me check that calculation. Sub(-2.2,-8.5) is (-2.2) - (-8.5) = 6.3. Divided by 2 gives 3.15, which is B. So B is 3.15, which is the amplitude. Therefore, the answer should be 3.15.

But let me confirm once more. Since the amplitude is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum divided by two, which is exactly what we did. So yes, 3.15 is correct. And since the problem mentions the points are (π/4, -2.2) and (3π/4, -8.5), the x-coordinates don't affect the amplitude directly because amplitude is purely about the vertical stretch. So the answer is 3.15.
