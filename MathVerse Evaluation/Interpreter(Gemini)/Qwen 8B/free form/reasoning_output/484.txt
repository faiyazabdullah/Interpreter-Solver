QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2). The point at (-5,2) and (3,2) are respectively solid and hollow. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

====================================================================================================
MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the domain and range of a function that passes through the points (-5, 2), (-1, 0), and (3, 2). Also, it mentions that (-5, 2) is solid and (3, 2) is hollow. Hmm, not sure if the solid/hollow part affects the function directly, but maybe it's just indicating something about the graph's style. Let me focus on the main goal: domain and range.

First, I need to figure out what kind of curve connects these three points. Since there are three points, maybe it's a quadratic function? Because a parabola is determined by three points. But wait, the problem says "there is a curve," so it could be a parabola or another type of curve. However, since we're asked for domain and range, which usually relate to functions, I think the curve is a function, so each x-value maps to one y-value. That suggests it's a parabola, or maybe a cubic? But with three points, a parabola (quadratic) would fit exactly. Let me check.

Let me recall that a quadratic function has the form f(x) = ax² + bx + c. If I can find the coefficients a, b, c such that the function passes through those three points, then I can analyze its domain and range. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify the type of curve, so maybe it's not necessarily a parabola. However, since we need to find the domain and range, and assuming it's a standard function, perhaps a parabola is the way to go. Alternatively, if it's a different curve, like a cubic, the domain would still be all real numbers, but the range might differ. But without more info, maybe the safest assumption is a parabola.

So, let's try to model it as a quadratic function. Let me set up equations based on the given points.

Given points:

(-5, 2): when x = -5, y = 2.

(-1, 0): x = -1, y = 0.

(3, 2): x = 3, y = 2.

So plugging into f(x) = ax² + bx + c.

For (-5, 2):

a*(-5)^2 + b*(-5) + c = 2 → 25a -5b + c = 2 ...(1)

For (-1, 0):

a*(-1)^2 + b*(-1) + c = 0 → a - b + c = 0 ...(2)

For (3, 2):

a*(3)^2 + b*3 + c = 2 → 9a + 3b + c = 2 ...(3)

Now, we have three equations:

Equation (1): 25a -5b + c = 2

Equation (2): a - b + c = 0

Equation (3): 9a + 3b + c = 2

We can solve this system of equations. Let me subtract equation (2) from equation (1) and equation (3) to eliminate c.

Subtract (2) from (1):

(25a -5b + c) - (a - b + c) = 2 - 0 → 24a -4b = 2 → Simplify: divide by 2 → 12a - 2b = 1 ...(4)

Similarly, subtract (2) from (3):

(9a + 3b + c) - (a - b + c) = 2 - 0 → 8a + 4b = 2 → Divide by 2: 4a + 2b = 1 ...(5)

Now, equations (4) and (5):

(4): 12a - 2b = 1

(5): 4a + 2b = 1

If we add equations (4) and (5):

12a -2b +4a +2b = 1 +1 → 16a = 2 → a = 2 /16 = 1/8.

Then substitute a = 1/8 into equation (5):

4*(1/8) + 2b = 1 → 0.5 + 2b = 1 → 2b = 0.5 → b = 0.25 = 1/4.

Now, plug a = 1/8 and b = 1/4 into equation (2) to find c:

a - b + c = 0 → (1/8) - (1/4) + c = 0 → (-1/8) + c = 0 → c = 1/8.

Therefore, the quadratic function is:

f(x) = (1/8)x² + (1/4)x + 1/8.

Wait, let me verify this with the third point. Let's test x=3:

f(3) = (1/8)(9) + (1/4)(3) + 1/8 = 9/8 + 3/4 + 1/8 = Convert to eighths: 9/8 + 6/8 + 1/8 = 16/8 = 2. Correct.

And x=-1: f(-1) = (1/8)(1) + (1/4)(-1) + 1/8 = 1/8 - 1/4 + 1/8 = (1 - 2 + 1)/8 = 0. Correct.

x=-5: f(-5) = (1/8)(25) + (1/4)(-5) + 1/8 = 25/8 -5/4 +1/8 = 25/8 -10/8 +1/8 = 16/8 = 2. Correct. All points satisfy.

So the function is f(x) = (1/8)x² + (1/4)x + 1/8. Now, to find the domain and range.

Since it's a quadratic function, the domain is all real numbers unless restricted. But the problem states that the curve goes through those three points, but no restrictions mentioned. Therefore, domain is (-∞, ∞).

But wait, the problem mentions that the curve goes through those three points, but maybe the curve isn't defined beyond certain points? But the question says "the domain and range of the function", implying that the function is defined over some domain. However, since it's a quadratic function, which is defined for all real numbers, the domain should be all real numbers. Unless there's some restriction from the curve's definition. But the problem didn't mention any other constraints, so I think domain is all real numbers.

Now, the range depends on whether the parabola opens upwards or downwards. Since the coefficient of x² is 1/8, which is positive, the parabola opens upwards, so the minimum value is at the vertex. Thus, the range is [minimum y-value, ∞).

To find the vertex, we can use the formula x = -b/(2a). Here, a = 1/8, b = 1/4.

x = -(1/4)/(2*(1/8)) = -(1/4) / (1/4) = -1. So the vertex is at x = -1. Plugging back into f(x):

f(-1) = (1/8)(1) + (1/4)(-1) + 1/8 = same as before, which gives 0. So the vertex is at (-1, 0). Which matches the second point given, (-1, 0). 

Thus, the minimum value is 0, so the range is [0, ∞).

Wait, but the problem mentions that (-5,2) is solid and (3,2) is hollow. Does that affect anything? Maybe the hollow point indicates that (3,2) is not part of the function? But the problem says "the curve goes through" those points, so they should all be on the curve. Perhaps the solid and hollow refer to something else, like the graph's style, but not affecting the function's domain or range. So regardless, the domain remains all real numbers and the range is [0, ∞).

Alternatively, could there be a different curve passing through those points with a different domain or range? For example, if it's a semicircle or something else. But given that the problem asks for domain and range of the function, and the curve is passing through those three points, the most straightforward assumption is a quadratic function. If it were a different curve, like a cubic, the domain would still be all real numbers, but the range might be all real numbers as well. However, since the parabola has a minimum, the range is [0, ∞). But if the curve was a different shape, say a vertical line, but that wouldn't pass through three points with different x-values. So I think the quadratic assumption is correct here.

Therefore, the domain is all real numbers, and the range is [0, ∞).

But let me double-check. Suppose someone thinks that maybe the curve is not a function, but the problem says "function". So even though the curve could be a non-function (like a sideways parabola), the question refers to it as a function, so it must pass the vertical line test. Hence, it's safe to assume it's a quadratic function opening upwards with vertex at (-1, 0). So yes, the domain is (-infty, infty), and the range is [0, infty).

Hence, the final answer for domain and range would be:

Domain: (-∞, ∞)

Range: [0, ∞)

Expressed in interval notation.

So the answer should be written as:

Domain: $(-\infty, \infty)$, Range: $[0, \infty)$

But the problem says "Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation." So combining them as per instructions.

But how to present them together? The user might expect two separate answers, but the instruction says "domain and range", so likely expecting both. However, looking at the examples given in the formatting guidelines, like "Domain: [−4, 4], Range: [0, 2]" – so probably list both.

But the required format is a single mathematical expression. Wait, the user said:

"Final Answer: $your_latex_expression_here$"

So maybe they want both domain and range expressed in one line? Or perhaps separated by commas?

Looking at the examples, for instance, "Domain: [−4, 4], Range: [0, 2]" is presented as two separate statements. However, since the output needs to be a single LaTeX expression, perhaps write both in one line, like:

Domain: $(-\infty, \infty)$, Range: $[0, \infty)$

But I need to check if that's acceptable. Alternatively, since the problem says "using interval notation", maybe the answer expects both domain and range in boxed notation? Wait, but the examples show different formats. Let me recheck the initial instructions.

The user says:

"Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation."

and

"Final Answer: $your_latex_expression_here$"

So the final answer is to be in a single LaTeX expression. But how to represent both domain and range in one line? Maybe as two intervals separated by commas inside the box. For example:

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } (-\infty, \infty), \text{Range: } [0, \infty)$

But I need to make sure that the LaTeX is properly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the question expects only the range? No, the question explicitly asks for both domain and range. Given that, the best way is to express both in the final answer as specified.

But since the user wants a single LaTeX expression, I'll structure it as:

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } (-\infty, \infty)\quad \text{Range: } [0, \infty)$

But I need to check if that's allowed. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the domain is all real numbers, so just state the range? But the question specifically asks for both. Well, given the ambiguity, but following the examples given in the formatting guidelines, where they wrote "Domain: ... , Range: ..." as separate, I think that's acceptable.

So putting it all together, the final answer would be:

Final Answer: $\text{Domain: } (-\infty, \infty)\quad \text{Range: } [0, \infty)$

But since the assistant is supposed to end with exactly that format, I need to ensure the LaTeX is correctly formatted. However, sometimes the system may require the answer within a single box. But according to the user's instruction, they want the final answer in proper LaTeX format, so I'll present both domain and range as specified.
