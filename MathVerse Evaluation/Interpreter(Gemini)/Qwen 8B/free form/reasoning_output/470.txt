MODEL'S INTERNAL REASONING (THINKING MODE):
====================================================================================================
Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the radius of a semicircle that passes through the points (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), and (7,0). Hmm, first I need to recall some geometry concepts here. Since it's a semicircle, maybe it's part of a full circle, but only half of it. But how do I find the radius?

Looking at the given points, they seem symmetric. Let me check if these points lie on a circle. If they do, then the radius would be the distance from the center of the circle to any of these points. Wait, but since it's a semicircle, perhaps the diameter is the line connecting two endpoints? Maybe the points (-7,0) and (7,0) are the endpoints of the diameter? That would make sense because those points are symmetric about the y-axis. Let me test that idea.

First, let me calculate the distance between (-7,0) and (7,0). The distance formula is sqrt[(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2]. Plugging in the values: sqrt[(7 - (-7))^2 + (0 - 0)^2] = sqrt[14^2] = 14. So if that's the diameter, the radius would be half of that, so 7 units. But wait, the problem mentions a semicircle passing through those points, so maybe the diameter is indeed between (-7,0) and (7,0), making the radius 7. However, I should verify if all other points lie on this circle.

Let me check if point (0,7) lies on the same circle. If the center is at the midpoint of (-7,0) and (7,0), which would be (0,0). Wait, the midpoint of (-7,0) and (7,0) is ((-7+7)/2, (0+0)/2) = (0,0). So the center would be at the origin. Then the radius is 7, as calculated earlier. Now, let's check if (0,7) is on this circle. The distance from (0,0) to (0,7) is sqrt[(0-0)^2 + (7-0)^2] = sqrt[49] = 7. Yes! So that point is on the circle. 

Now checking another point, say (-5,5). Distance from center (0,0): sqrt[(-5)^2 + 5^2] = sqrt(25 +25) = sqrt(50) ≈ 7.07... Wait, that's not 7. Wait, that contradicts. So if the radius is 7, then this point shouldn't be on the circle. But according to the problem statement, all these points lie on the semicircle. So there must be something wrong with my assumption.

Hmm, maybe the diameter isn't between (-7,0) and (7,0)? Or maybe the center isn't at (0,0). Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe the circle isn't centered at the origin. Let me try to find the correct center.

Since the points are (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0), perhaps there's a better way. Let me consider three non-collinear points to find the circumcircle. Let's take points A(-7,0), D(0,7), and F(7,0). Wait, but the problem says that Arc(A,F,D) exists, which suggests that A, F, D are points on the circle. So maybe the arc from A to F passing through D. But if we have three points, we can find the circle equation.

Alternatively, since the points include (-7,0), (0,7), (7,0), maybe the circle has its center somewhere else. Let me set up equations for the general circle equation. The standard form is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2. We can plug in the points to find h, k, and r.

Take point A(-7,0): (-7 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r^2 → (h +7)^2 + k² = r² ... (1)

Point D(0,7): (0 - h)^2 + (7 - k)^2 = r² → h² + (k -7)^2 = r² ... (2)

Point F(7,0): (7 - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 = r² → (h -7)^2 + k² = r² ... (3)

Subtract equation (1) from equation (3):

(h -7)^2 + k² - [(h +7)^2 + k²] = 0 → expand:

[h² -14h +49 + k²] - [h² +14h +49 + k²] = 0 → h² -14h +49 +k² - h² -14h -49 -k² = -28h = 0 → h=0.

So the x-coordinate of the center is 0. Therefore, the center is at (0,k). Now plug back into equations (1) and (2):

From equation (1): (0 +7)^2 + k² = r² → 49 + k² = r² ... (1a)

From equation (2): 0² + (k -7)^2 = r² → (k -7)^2 = r² ... (2a)

Set them equal: 49 + k² = (k -7)^2 → Expand RHS: k² -14k +49. So,

49 + k² = k² -14k +49 → Subtract 49 +k² from both sides: 0 = -14k → k=0.

Wait, that would mean the center is at (0,0), and radius squared is 49 + 0² = 49. So radius is 7. But earlier, when checking point (-5,5), the distance from (0,0) was sqrt(25 +25)=sqrt(50)≈7.07, which doesn't equal 7. Contradiction. So why does the problem say that all these points lie on the semicircle? There's inconsistency here.

Wait, but maybe the semicircle is not the entire circle. Perhaps it's only half of the circle. But even then, all the points should still lie on the circle. Unless some points are on the diameter? Wait, the points (-7,0) and (7,0) are on the x-axis, while (0,7) is on the y-axis. So if the circle is centered at (0,0) with radius 7, then the points (-7,0), (7,0), and (0,7) are on the circle. However, the points (-5,5) and (5,5) aren't on that circle. So either the problem is incorrect, or my understanding is missing something.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says "the following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0)." But according to the given predicates, Points A, B, D, E, F are on the circle C. Also, PointLiesOnCircle(A,C), etc. And also, RadiusOf(Line(D, (0,0)),C) is stated with LengthOf being 7. Similarly for Line(A, (0,0)) and Line(F, (0,0)). So the predicates indicate that the radius is 7, because the length from D to (0,0) is 7, which is the radius. Wait, but D is (0,7). So the distance from D to (0,0) is 7 units. So the radius is 7. But that seems conflicting with the previous calculation where (-5,5) is not on that circle. But maybe the problem is referring to a different circle?

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me re-examine the given predicates. It says:

RadiusOf(Line(D, (0,0)),C) and LengthOf(Line(D, (0,0)),7). Also, IsRadiusOf(Line(D, (0,0)),C). So this indicates that the radius of circle C is the distance from point D to (0,0), which is 7. Therefore, the radius is 7. So regardless of the other points, the radius is given as 7 via the predicates. But then why are the other points mentioned? Because the problem states that the semicircle passes through those points, implying that they lie on the circle with radius 7. But according to my previous calculation, that's not true for points like (-5,5). So there's a contradiction here. 

But perhaps the problem is designed such that despite those points not lying on the circle with radius 7, the given predicates state that they are on the circle. Wait, but the user provided several predicates including PointLiesOnCircle for each of A, B, D, E, F. So according to the problem's setup, all these points lie on circle C, whose radius is 7. Therefore, the radius is 7. Hence, the answer is 7.

But then why is there confusion with the points not lying on the circle? Maybe the problem has a mistake, but according to the given predicates, the radius is 7. So the answer should be 7. Let me confirm once more.

Given that the radius is defined as the distance from D to (0,0), which is 7, and that's confirmed by the LengthOf predicate. Therefore, regardless of whether other points fit, the radius is 7. So the answer is 7 units.
