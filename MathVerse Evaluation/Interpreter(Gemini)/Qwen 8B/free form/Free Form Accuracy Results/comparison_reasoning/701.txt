GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is "$ \text{Surface Area} = 768 \text{ cm}^2 $" and the original answer is "768 \mathrm{cm}^2".

1.  Numerical Equivalence: Both answers have the numerical value of 768.

2.  Unit Consistency: Both answers have the same unit, which is $cm^2$ (square centimeters), which is a unit of area. The LLM answer uses "cm" and the original answer uses "\mathrm{cm}", both representing centimeters.

3.  Formatting Differences: The LLM answer includes "Surface Area = " and uses LaTeX formatting. These are formatting differences that don't affect the mathematical equivalence.

Therefore, the two answers represent the same mathematical result.
