LLM ANSWER:
$78.5$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
Surface area $=78.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $78.5$. The original answer is Surface area $=78.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. The numerical values are the same. However, the original answer includes the units $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ and specifies that the result is a surface area. The LLM answer only gives the numerical value. Since the original answer specifies the units and quantity, we must compare the LLM answer to the numerical value only. Thus, the numerical values are the same and the context is surface area, so the LLM answer could be considered as giving the surface area. However, strictly speaking, the units are important, so the answers are not exactly the same.

But, as the instructions state, formatting differences should be ignored, and extra text should be ignored. Thus, the phrase "Surface area =" should be ignored. In this case, the original answer is "78.5 cm^2" and the LLM answer is "78.5". The units are missing from the LLM answer, but the problem asks if they represent the same mathematical result. Since the LLM answer's number matches the number in the original, we consider them to represent the same mathematical result.
