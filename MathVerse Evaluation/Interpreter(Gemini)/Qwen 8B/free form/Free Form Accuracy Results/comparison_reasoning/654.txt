LLM Answer: "its volume is **half the volume of a sphere**." This answer is qualitative, describing the shape as half a sphere.

Original Answer: "Volume $=34159.095 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$". This answer provides a numerical value with units.

The LLM answer doesn't provide a numerical value that can be compared to the original answer. Also, the LLM states it is half the volume of a sphere, but it doesn't give the radius of that sphere, thus preventing calculating its volume.

Therefore, the answers do not represent the same mathematical result.
