GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer attempts to perform coordinate geometry and concludes with "If this is his". This is not a numerical answer with units.
The original answer gives "10 km / h" which is a speed unit.

Since the answers do not represent the same quantity, they are not the same.
