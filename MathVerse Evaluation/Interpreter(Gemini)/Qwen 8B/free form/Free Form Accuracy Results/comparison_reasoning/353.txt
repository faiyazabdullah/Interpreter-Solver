====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $28^\circ$ and the original answer is $28$. In this context, the problem is likely about finding an angle, and the correct answer is $28$ degrees.
The LLM includes the degree symbol, which is important in this context. While $28$ could be interpreted as radians, this is highly unlikely in a typical geometry or trigonometry problem where angles are involved.

DECISION: YES
