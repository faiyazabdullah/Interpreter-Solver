GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is 126.0 cm^3 and the original answer is 125.3 cm^3.
The units are the same. The numerical values are different.
126.0 and 125.3 are close, but the difference is 0.7, which seems significant enough to consider them different. I don't have enough context to determine whether rounding is involved. Let's assume they need to be precise and therefore different.

DECISION: NO
