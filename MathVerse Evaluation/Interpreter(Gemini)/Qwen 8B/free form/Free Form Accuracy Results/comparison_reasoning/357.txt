ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 357
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$If the total angle at C is 180° (sum of two right angles), and the total angle at D is 90°, angle at B is 35°, then angle at A is 55°. In triangle ACD, angle at A is 55°, and since$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$35^\circ$

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
LLM GENERATED ANSWER: The LLM's answer includes an incomplete statement, ending with "angle at A is 55°, and since". It also indicates that angle B is 35 degrees. It attempts to provide some background information, but does not explicitly state the final answer.

ORIGINAL/CORRECT ANSWER: The original answer is $35^\circ$.

COMPARISON:
The LLM generated answer states that angle B is 35 degrees. While the LLM's answer attempts to explain the reasoning, it doesn't arrive at the final correct numerical answer. The original answer states a single numerical value for the angle in degrees. The LLM's incomplete reasoning and lack of a final numerical answer do not match the original answer.

DECISION: NO
