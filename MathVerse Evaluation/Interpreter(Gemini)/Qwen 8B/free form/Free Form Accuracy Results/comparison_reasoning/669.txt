LLM answer: 52647.57
Original answer: Surface Area = 52647.45 units $^{2}$

Numerical values are 52647.57 and 52647.45. The difference is 0.12.
Units are present in the original answer but not the LLM answer, however, the LLM answer is just the number and the original answer is "Surface Area = [number] units^2", so the LLM answer is implicitly representing the number associated with the surface area.
The numerical values are very close, suggesting a rounding difference. Given the context of a surface area calculation, the difference of 0.12 is likely due to rounding and is acceptable.
