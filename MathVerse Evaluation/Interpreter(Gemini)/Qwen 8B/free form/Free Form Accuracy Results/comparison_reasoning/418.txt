$74$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
Perimeter $=74 \mathrm{~mm}$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "74" and the original answer is "Perimeter $=74 \mathrm{~mm}$".
The numerical values are the same (74).
The original answer has units of "mm" (millimeters), which represent length.
The LLM answer does not explicitly mention units, but the original answer specifies that the value represents the perimeter. Perimeter has units of length. Therefore, the LLM answer should have the same units as the original answer for it to be the same. However, without the units, the answer "74" could technically represent anything. Because the original answer states the units explicitly, and the LLM answer does not, they are not the same.
