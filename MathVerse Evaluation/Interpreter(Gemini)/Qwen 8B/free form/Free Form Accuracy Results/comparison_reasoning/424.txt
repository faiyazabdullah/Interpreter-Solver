GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $60.21$. The original answer is $60.21 \mathrm{m}^2$.
The numerical values are the same. However, the LLM answer has no units specified, while the original answer specifies the units as square meters, $\mathrm{m}^2$, which is a unit of area. Since the problem involves area, the unit $\mathrm{m}^2$ is necessary. The LLM's answer does not include the units and therefore does not represent the same mathematical result as the original answer.
