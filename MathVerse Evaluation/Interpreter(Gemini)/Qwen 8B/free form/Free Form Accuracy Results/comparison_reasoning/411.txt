GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "$257.73$" and the original answer is "Perimeter $=257.73 \mathrm{~m}$".
Both answers have the same numerical value, 257.73. The original answer also includes the unit "m" which stands for meters, and specifies that this is the perimeter. The LLM answer does not include the unit or specify that it is the perimeter. However, the numerical value is the same. The question asks if the answers represent the same mathematical result. Without knowing the context of the problem, we assume it is asking for a numerical result representing the perimeter.
