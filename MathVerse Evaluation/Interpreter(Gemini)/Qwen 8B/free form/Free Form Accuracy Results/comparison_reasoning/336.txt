GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is $31^\circ$ and the original answer is 329° T.

The numerical values are 31 and 329, which are significantly different.
The unit is degrees in both cases, but the "T" in the original answer indicates it's a bearing or heading in navigation, specifically a True bearing. Without additional information, it's impossible to determine a mathematical relationship between 31 degrees and 329 degrees True. They represent vastly different directions.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.
