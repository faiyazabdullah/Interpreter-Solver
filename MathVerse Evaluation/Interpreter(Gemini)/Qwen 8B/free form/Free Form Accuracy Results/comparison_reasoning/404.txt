GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is 7298.6735. The original answer is 7298.6737 mm².

The numerical values are close, but not exactly the same. The difference is 0.0002.
Since the original answer has units of mm², the LLM answer should also have units of mm².

Without knowing the context of the problem, it's hard to say if the difference of 0.0002 is significant. However, since the LLM answer doesn't have units, and the numerical values are slightly different, I will say they are not the same.

DECISION: NO
