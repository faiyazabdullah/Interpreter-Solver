GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "94".
The original answer is "Perimeter = 94 cm".

The numerical values are both 94.
The original answer includes units "cm" for centimeters and states that this is the value for "Perimeter". The LLM answer gives just the number 94, implying that it is the value of the perimeter. Since the original answer has units of length, the LLM answer needs to have those units as well in order to be completely equivalent. However, they have the same numerical value, and the LLM could be interpreted as just stating the numerical value.

DECISION: YES
