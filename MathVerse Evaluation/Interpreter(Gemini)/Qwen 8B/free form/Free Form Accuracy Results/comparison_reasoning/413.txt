ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$r=24.4$

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "$r = 24.4 \text{ cm}$" and the original answer is "$r=24.4$".

Both answers refer to the same variable $r$.
The numerical value in the LLM answer is 24.4. The numerical value in the original answer is 24.4. These values are the same.
The LLM answer has units of "cm" (centimeters), while the original answer has no units specified. In the context of a mathematics problem, the absence of units can sometimes be interpreted as implicitly stating a unit of length is expected, or that the value is dimensionless. However, since the LLM specifies "cm" and the original has no units specified, we need to determine if these answers can still be the same. Without additional context, there is no way to verify that $r$ should indeed have units of centimeters.

However, if we assume this is a numerical answer extracted from an equation with $r$ in centimeters, it is best practice to specify the units. In that case, the answers would be the same in that they are numerically equivalent. If the original answer did require a unit, then the original is incomplete.

In the interest of comparing these two answers, we will evaluate them as though they represent the same mathematical answer, accepting that the original has simply not provided a unit of length.
