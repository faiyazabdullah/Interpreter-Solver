====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
LLM answer: 221 degrees
Original answer: 319^\circ T

1. Numerical values: LLM has 221, Original has 319.
2. Units: LLM has degrees. Original has degrees True.
3. Directional/Angular Equivalence: The answers are not directionally equivalent. The 'T' likely stands for True bearing, indicating an angle measured clockwise from North. This would mean 319 degrees clockwise from North. 221 degrees by itself is just an angle, but needs to be interpreted as a direction. Since 221 and 319 are different values, they do not represent the same direction.
