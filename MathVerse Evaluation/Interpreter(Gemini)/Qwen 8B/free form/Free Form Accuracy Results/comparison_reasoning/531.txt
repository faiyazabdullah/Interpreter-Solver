ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 531
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$y = 2$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$2$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $y = 2$, which implies that the variable $y$ has a value of 2.
The original answer is $2$, which is just a numerical value.

In the context of solving for a variable, these answers are NOT the same. The first answer specifies the value of a variable, while the second only specifies a number. However, if the problem asked to solve for $y$ and the original answer was the result of solving the equation for $y$ and obtaining $y = 2$, then the answers would be the same. Here, we are not given this context, so we assume that the correct answer is simply the value 2. The LLM answer includes $y=$, which is extra.
