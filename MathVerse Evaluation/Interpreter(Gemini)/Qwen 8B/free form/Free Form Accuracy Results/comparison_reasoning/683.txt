ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 683
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$- Edges $ AD$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
\sqrt{AB^2+BD^2+DF^2}

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "- Edges $AD$", which seems to be related to a geometric figure. The original answer is "$\sqrt{AB^2+BD^2+DF^2}$", which is a mathematical expression representing the square root of the sum of squares of three lengths.

The two answers are not equivalent. The LLM answer refers to a specific edge, while the original answer provides a formula that calculates a length based on three other lengths. They do not represent the same mathematical result.
