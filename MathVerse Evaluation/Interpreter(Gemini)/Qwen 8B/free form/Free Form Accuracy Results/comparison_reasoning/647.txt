LLM ANSWER:
$ \text{Volume} = 56.55 $

ORIGINAL ANSWER:

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "Volume = 56.55".
The original answer is "56.55 units $^{3}$".

Numerical values are the same: 56.55
The LLM answer is missing the units. The original answer has "units $^{3}$", which are volume units. However, the prompt mentioned that if the units are missing but the numerical value is the same, and if we are able to identify the quantity, it is the same. In this case, since the LLM answer included "Volume =" it can be inferred that the numerical value refers to a volume calculation.
