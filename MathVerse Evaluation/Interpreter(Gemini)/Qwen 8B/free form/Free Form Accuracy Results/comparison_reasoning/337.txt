$42^\circ$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
270 ^\circ T

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is $42^\circ$, which is a measure of an angle in degrees. The original answer is $270^\circ T$, which represents a compass bearing of 270 degrees True. While both answers involve degrees, one represents a general angle, and the other represents a direction on a compass. $270^\circ T$ is the same as West. $42^\circ$ is just an angle measure, and doesn't imply any compass direction. These are clearly not the same thing.
