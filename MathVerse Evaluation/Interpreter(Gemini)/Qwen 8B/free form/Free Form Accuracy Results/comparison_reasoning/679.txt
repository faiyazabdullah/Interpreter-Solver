ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$54.74$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "$54.74^\circ$", and the original answer is "$54.74$".
The numerical values are the same, namely 54.74.
The LLM answer includes the degree symbol, which indicates that the answer is an angle.
The original answer does not include any units.
Since there is no context given for the original answer, it is possible that the original answer should have included the degree symbol.
If the problem asked for an angle, then both answers are mathematically equivalent.
If the problem asked for a length, or something else other than an angle, then the LLM response is incorrect.

Assuming the problem involves an angle, then the LLM answer is correct. Without more context, it is difficult to tell. However, given that the original answer does not include units, and the LLM answer includes degrees, it is more likely that the LLM answer represents the same mathematical result.
