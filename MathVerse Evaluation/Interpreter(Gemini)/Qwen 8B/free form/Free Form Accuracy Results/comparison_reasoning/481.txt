LLM ANSWER:
$\text{Domain: } (-3, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [-4, 0]$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$\text{Domain: } [-4, 0),\quad \text{Range: } (-3, 1]$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer provides the domain as $(-3, 1]$ and the range as $[-4, 0]$.
The correct answer provides the domain as $[-4, 0)$ and the range as $(-3, 1]$.
The domain and range are switched between the two answers. The intervals are also different. The first answer includes 1 in the domain and 0 in the range, but does not include -3 in the domain nor 0 in the domain of the second answer. Similarly the correct answer includes -4 in the domain and 1 in the range, but does not include 0 in the domain nor -3 in the range of the first answer.
The two answers are not the same.
