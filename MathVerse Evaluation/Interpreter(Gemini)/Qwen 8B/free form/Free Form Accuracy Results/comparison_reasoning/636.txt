ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 636
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$r = 5$ meters. Thus, the value of $ r $ is $\boxed{5}$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$r=5$

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is "r = 5 meters. Thus, the value of $ r $ is $\boxed{5}$" and the original answer is "r=5".

1. Numerical Equivalence: Both answers imply the numerical value of 'r' is 5.
2. Unit Consistency: The LLM answer includes the unit "meters" initially, but then extracts the numerical value as simply '5'. The original answer doesn't explicitly state units. However, given the context of mathematical problems, it's reasonable to assume the "r" represents a numerical value, even without the unit. Since the numerical part is same, we can say they represent the same result here.

Therefore, the two answers represent the same mathematical result.
