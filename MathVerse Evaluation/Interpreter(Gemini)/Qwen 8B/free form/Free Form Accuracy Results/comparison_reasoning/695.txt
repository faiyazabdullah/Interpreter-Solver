GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $31.8$ and the original answer is $89.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

The numerical values are $31.8$ and $89.1$, which are significantly different.
Also, the units are missing in the LLM answer, and the original answer has units of $\mathrm{cm}^{3}$, which represents volume. Without knowing the context of the problem, we cannot determine if they are the same. But it appears that the numerical values are different and the LLM answer is missing units. Therefore, the answers are not the same.
