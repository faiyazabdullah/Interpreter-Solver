GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $148^\circ$, which represents an angle in degrees. The original answer is $212^\circ T$, which represents a true bearing. A true bearing is an angle measured clockwise from North.

To determine if these two answers represent the same mathematical result, we need to understand what each answer is representing. The LLM answer of $148^\circ$ is simply an angle measure. The original answer of $212^\circ T$ is a bearing, measured clockwise from North.

We need to assess whether $148^\circ$ and $212^\circ T$ could represent the same direction or angle. There's no way they can represent the same thing, as they are completely different values with different notations/units. The $T$ signifies a true bearing, which the other does not have.
