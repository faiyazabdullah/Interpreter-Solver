GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM's answer "BF=11cm. This would suggest that the vertical edges are 11cm, not 15cm" gives BF=11cm as a possible answer, with units of cm. The original answer is y=21.61, without units.  Since the numerical values are different (11 vs. 21.61) and the variables are different (BF vs. y), and no units are given for y, these are not the same.

DECISION: NO
