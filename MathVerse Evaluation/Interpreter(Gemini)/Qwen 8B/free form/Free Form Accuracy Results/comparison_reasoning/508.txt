GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "-4". The original answer is "slope = -4". The LLM answer gives the numerical value of the slope without explicitly stating that it is the slope. The original answer explicitly states that the value is the slope. However, in a mathematical context, providing the numerical value without explicit units is acceptable, assuming the context makes it clear what the value refers to. In this case, given that we are comparing it to "slope = -4", it is clear that the LLM is providing the value of the slope. Therefore, they represent the same mathematical result.
