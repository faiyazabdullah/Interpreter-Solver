The LLM generated answer is $18.8$.
The original answer is Perimeter $=18.8 \mathrm{~cm}$.
Both answers have the same numerical value of 18.8. The original answer specifies the units as cm and identifies that the value is the perimeter. The LLM generated answer does not include the units or what the value represents. However, since the context of the problem is mathematical, and the numerical value is the same, we can assume that the LLM answer is the same as the original answer.
