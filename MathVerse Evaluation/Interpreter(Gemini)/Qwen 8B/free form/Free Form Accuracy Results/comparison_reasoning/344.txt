GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The two answers are 53.7 degrees and 53.6 degrees. They are close but not equal. The difference is 0.1 degrees. Without further context about the problem, it's hard to say if this difference is acceptable due to rounding. However, since they are not exactly the same, I will say they are not the same.

DECISION: NO
