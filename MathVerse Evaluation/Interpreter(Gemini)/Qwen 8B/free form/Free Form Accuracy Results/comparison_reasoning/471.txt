GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM's answer is $x^2 + y^2 = 49$ with $y \geq 0$.
The original answer is $y = \sqrt{49 - x^2}$.

The LLM's answer represents the upper half of a circle with radius 7 centered at the origin.  The condition $y \geq 0$ restricts the circle to the upper half.
The original answer, $y = \sqrt{49 - x^2}$, is equivalent to $y^2 = 49 - x^2$, which can be rewritten as $x^2 + y^2 = 49$.  Since the square root is always non-negative, $y \geq 0$.  Thus, the original answer also represents the upper half of a circle with radius 7 centered at the origin.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.
