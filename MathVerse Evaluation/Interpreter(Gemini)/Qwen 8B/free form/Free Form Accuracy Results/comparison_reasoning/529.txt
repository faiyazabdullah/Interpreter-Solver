ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$0.2$

====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is "$y = 0.2$" and the original answer is "$0.2$".

1.  NUMERICAL EQUIVALENCE: Both answers include the numerical value 0.2.
2.  UNIT CONSISTENCY: There are no explicit units in either answer. However, the LLM answer includes the variable "y", suggesting it might represent a value assigned to the variable y.
3.  MATHEMATICAL EXPRESSIONS: The LLM answer, "y = 0.2", expresses that y is equal to 0.2. The original answer, "0.2", is simply the numerical value. If we consider the context of solving for y, both can represent the same mathematical result where y is equal to 0.2.

Therefore, the two answers represent the same mathematical result.
