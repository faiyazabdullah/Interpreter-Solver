====================================================================================================
GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM generated answer is "53.24471805". The original answer is "Volume = 10.45 cm^3".

1.  **Numerical Equivalence**: The numerical values are 53.24471805 and 10.45, which are significantly different.

2.  **Unit Consistency**: The LLM generated answer does not have units. The original answer has units of "cm^3", which is a volume unit. Even if the numerical values were close, the lack of units in the LLM answer would make them different.

Since the numerical values are different and the LLM answer lacks units, the two answers are not the same.

DECISION: NO
