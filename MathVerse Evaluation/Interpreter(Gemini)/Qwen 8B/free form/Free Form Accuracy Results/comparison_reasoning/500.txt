ANSWER COMPARISON FOR PROBLEM 500
====================================================================================================
LLM ANSWER:
$(-\infty, 2)$

ORIGINAL ANSWER:
$\text{Increasing at } (2, \infty) \text{ and decreasing at } (-\infty, 2)$

GEMINI COMPARISON ANALYSIS:
====================================================================================================
The LLM answer is $(-\infty, 2)$, which represents an interval on the real number line. The original answer states "Increasing at $(2, \infty)$ and decreasing at $(-\infty, 2)$".
The LLM's answer $(-\infty, 2)$ represents the interval where the function is decreasing. The original answer correctly identifies the interval where the function is decreasing as $(-\infty, 2)$. Although the original answer also specifies where the function is increasing, this doesn't make the LLM's answer incorrect. However, the problem asks to compare these two answers and determine if they represent the same mathematical result. In this case, the LLM gives only part of the answer by only identifying the interval where the function is decreasing. The original answer identifies both the intervals for increasing and decreasing. If the original answer only asked to specify the interval where the function is decreasing, then the LLM answer would be correct. Since the original problem is not specified, the LLM and the original answer do not represent the same mathematical result because the original answer specifies both increasing and decreasing intervals.
