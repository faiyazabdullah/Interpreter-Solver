PROBLEM 521 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: This is the graph of $y=x^3-x^2-x$ that goes through (-1,-1), (0,0), (1,-1), (2,2). Use the graph to determine how many solutions the equation $x^3-x^2-x=-2$ has.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a cubic function.
- The x-axis and y-axis are labeled.
- The equation of the function is given as $y = x^3 - x^2 - x$.
- The graph passes through the points (-1, 0), (0, 0), and approximately (1.6, 0).
- We are asked to find the number of solutions to the equation $x^3 - x^2 - x = -2$.
- This is equivalent to finding the number of intersections between the graph of $y = x^3 - x^2 - x$ and the line $y = -2$.
- Looking at the graph, we can see that the line $y = -2$ would intersect the graph at three points.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The points (-1, 0), (0, 0) lie on the x-axis.
- The given equation is $y=x^3-x^2-x$. We are asked to find the number of solutions of $x^3-x^2-x=-2$.
- This problem translates to asking how many times the graph of $y=x^3-x^2-x$ intersects the line $y=-2$. From the graph, it is clear that the graph intersects the line $y=-2$ at 3 locations.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The intersections between the curve $y = x^3 - x^2 - x$ and the line $y = -2$ will determine the number of solutions to the equation $x^3 - x^2 - x = -2$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We want to know the number of solutions to $x^3-x^2-x = -2$. This is equivalent to finding the number of intersections of the graph with the line $y = -2$.
