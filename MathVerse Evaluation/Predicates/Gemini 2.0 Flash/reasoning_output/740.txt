PROBLEM 740 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the height h mm of this closed cylinder if its surface area (S) is $27288$mm2 and the radius (r) of its circular faces is 43mm.

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a closed cylinder.
- The cylinder has two circular faces and a curved surface.
- The radius of the circular faces is given as 43 mm.
- The height of the cylinder is labeled as h mm.
- The surface area of the cylinder is given as 27288 mm².

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circular faces is 43 mm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the circular faces.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two circular faces are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The surface area of the closed cylinder can be expressed as the sum of the areas of the two circular faces and the area of the curved surface. The area of each circular face is πr², and the area of the curved surface is 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height.
- Surface area (S) = 2πr² + 2πrh = 2πr(r+h)
- Given S = 27288 mm² and r = 43 mm.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information to solve the problem is included.
- The relationships between the surface area, radius, and height are represented.
