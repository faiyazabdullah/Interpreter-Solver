PROBLEM 622 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The logarithm function and a line are graphed. Logarithm function $f$ is graphed in blue and it goes through (30,4), (5,2), (55,5). Line $y=4$ is graphed in red and parallel to x-axis. A pharmaceutical scientist making a new medication wonders how much of the active ingredient to include in a dose. They are curious how long different amounts of the active ingredient will stay in someone's bloodstream.

The amount of time (in hours) the active ingredient remains in the bloodstream can be modeled by $f(x)=-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, where $x$ is the initial amount of the active ingredient (in milligrams). Here is the graph of $f$ and the graph of the line $y=4$.

Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection point of the graphs?

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with x and y axes.
- A curve is labeled as $f$ and is defined by the function $f(x) = -1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$.
- A horizontal line is labeled as $y=4$.
- The curve and the horizontal line intersect.
- Several points on the curve $f$ can be estimated visually.
- The intersection point visually around x = 30.
- The scales are in units of 5 or 10.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The function $f(x)$ intersects the line $y=4$.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The intersection point represents the x-value where $f(x) = 4$.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information from the graph, the function, and the line will solve the posed problem.
