PROBLEM 535 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{2}{3} \pi, 1.2\right)$, and it has a minimum point at $\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi,-3.4\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph with a trigonometric function (looks like a cosine or sine wave).
- There is a sinusoidal curve oscillating between a maximum and a minimum.
- There are two labeled points on the graph: $(\frac{2}{3}\pi, 1.2)$ and $(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4)$.
- The line y=1.2 appears to be the midline of the function, indicated by a dashed line.
- The amplitude of the function represents the vertical distance from the midline to a maximum or minimum point.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles present in this problem

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicit angles or perpendicularity shown

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no congruence or explicit equal measurements shown

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The two points are on the sinusoidal graph

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
We can calculate the amplitude of the sine function by finding the vertical distance from the point $(\frac{4}{3}\pi, -3.4)$ to the horizontal line $y = 1.2$.
The amplitude is $|1.2 - (-3.4)| = |1.2 + 3.4| = 4.6$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All given points and the presence of the midline are represented in the predicates.
