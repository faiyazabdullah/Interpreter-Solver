PROBLEM 356 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In triangle ABC, angle A is 60°, angle B is 35°, and the length of the perpendicular CD of AB is 9. Consider the following diagram.Hence, find the length of AB correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Triangle ABC, right triangles ADC and BDC
- Points: A, B, C, D
- Lines: AB, AC, BC, CD
- Angles: Angle A = 60 degrees, Angle B = 35 degrees, Angle ADC = 90 degrees, Angle BDC = 90 degrees
- Measurements: CD = 9
- Special markings: Right angle symbols at D on line AB

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ADC and Angle BDC are right angles, therefore CD is perpendicular to AB.
- Angle A is 60 degrees and Angle B is 35 degrees.
- In triangle ADC, Angle ACD = 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees.
- In triangle BDC, Angle BCD = 180 - 90 - 35 = 55 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent triangles are immediately obvious.
- There are no marked equal lengths or angles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- CD intersects AB at point D.
- Point D lies on line AB.
- CD is an altitude from C to AB.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is not a right triangle.
- Triangles ADC and BDC are right triangles.
- CD is perpendicular to AB.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
