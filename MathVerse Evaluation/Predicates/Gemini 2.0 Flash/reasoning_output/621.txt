PROBLEM 621 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the graph shown. A curve passes (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), (3,8). As x increases, y increases.


Which of the following relationships could be represented by the given graph?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph with x and y axes. A curve is plotted. The curve passes through the points (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), and (3,8). As x increases, y increases. The graph is increasing exponentially.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No explicit congruence markings are present.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The curve passes through (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), and (3,8).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The curve is exponential. The relation is y = 2^x.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The information is captured.
