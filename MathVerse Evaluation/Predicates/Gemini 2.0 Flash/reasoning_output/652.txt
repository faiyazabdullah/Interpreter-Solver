================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a sphere. The radius of the sphere is indicated as 22.36 mm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The figure is a sphere and the radius is given.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The volume of the sphere can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) * pi * r^3, where r is the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The radius of the sphere is given.
