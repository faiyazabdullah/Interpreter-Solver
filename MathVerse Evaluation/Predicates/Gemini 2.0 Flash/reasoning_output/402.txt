PROBLEM 402 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diameter of the figure is $ 52.72 \mathrm{~cm}$. The figure follows that half of a circle has area $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^{2}$. Find the exact area of the shape shown.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a semi-circle.
- A diameter of 52.72 cm is given.
- There are no explicit right angles.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The shape is a semi-circle so it's half of a circle.
- The given length (52.72 cm) is the diameter of the circle.
- The radius of the circle is half the diameter.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked angles or perpendicular lines in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radii are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The endpoints of the diameter lie on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of a circle is $\pi r^2$.
- The area of a semicircle is half the area of a circle, or $\frac{1}{2} \pi r^2$.
- The radius is half of the diameter.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The diameter is provided. The area formula depends on radius, which can be computed from diameter.
