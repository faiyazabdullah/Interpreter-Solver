PROBLEM 170 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in Rttriangle ABC, angle C = 90.0, AC = 4.0, AB = 5.0, then the value of sinB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C.
We are given the length of side AC as 4.0 and the length of the hypotenuse AB as 5.0.
The goal is to find sin(B).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle C is a right angle.
Triangle ABC is a right triangle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
We know the lengths of two sides of the triangle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The lines intersect at points A, B, and C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified all necessary information.
