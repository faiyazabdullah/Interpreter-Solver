PROBLEM 018 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The positions of straight lines a, b, c, and d are shown in the figure. If angle 1 = 58.0, angle 2 = 58.0, angle 3 = 70.0, then angle 4 is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have four lines a, b, c, and d.
- We have four angles labeled as Angle 1, Angle 2, Angle 3, and Angle 4.
- Angle 1 measures 58 degrees.
- Angle 2 measures 58 degrees.
- Angle 3 measures 70 degrees.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 and the 58 degree angle below it are vertical angles and therefore equal.
- Angle 2 and the 58 degree angle above it are vertical angles and therefore equal.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 = Angle 2 = 58 degrees. This implies lines a and b are parallel.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since lines a and b are parallel, Angle 3 and the supplementary angle to Angle 4 are corresponding angles and therefore equal.
