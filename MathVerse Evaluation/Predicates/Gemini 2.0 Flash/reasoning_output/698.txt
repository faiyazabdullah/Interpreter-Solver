PROBLEM 698 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A hole is drilled through a rectangular box forming the solid shown. The box has sides of length 10cm, 8cm and 14cm. The radius of hole is 2cm. Find the volume of the solid, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangular box with a cylindrical hole drilled through it.
- The dimensions of the box are 10cm x 8cm x 14cm.
- The radius of the hole is 2cm.
- The hole is drilled through the 14cm length.
- The front face of the box is a rectangle with dimensions 10cm x 8cm, with a circle cut out.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 2cm.
- The circle is centered on the front face.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The sides of the rectangular box are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Opposite sides of the rectangular box are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The circular hole intersects the rectangular faces of the box.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the solid is the volume of the rectangular box minus the volume of the cylinder removed.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should include the dimensions of the box and the radius of the circle, as well as the fact that the hole is a cylinder.
