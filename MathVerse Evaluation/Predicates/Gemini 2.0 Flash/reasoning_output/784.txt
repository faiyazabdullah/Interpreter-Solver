PROBLEM 784 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Point O is the center of both circles in the figure above. If the circumference of the large circle is 36 and the radius of the small circle is half of the radius of the large circle, what is the length of the darkened arc?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two circles are present, one inside the other, sharing the same center O.
- There is an angle of 80 degrees at the center O. This angle intercepts arcs on both circles.
- The circumference of the larger circle is given as 36.
- The radius of the smaller circle is half the radius of the larger circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Let the radius of the larger circle be R and the radius of the smaller circle be r.
- O is the center of both circles.
- The circumference of the larger circle is 2 * pi * R = 36.
- The relationship between the radii is r = R/2.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The central angle is 80 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of smaller circle is half the radius of the large circle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two circles share the same center O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The length of the darkened arc on the smaller circle can be calculated using the formula: arc length = (central angle/360) * circumference.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is present: Circumference of the large circle, the relationship between the two radii, and the angle at the center.
