PROBLEM 754 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, there is a triangle and two line segments in the figure, and the angle formed by the two segments is x. The two angles labeled in the figure are 55° and 75° respectively. What is the value of x?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a figure containing two triangles and a large triangle formed by segments. There are two labeled angles with values 55° and 75°. There is an angle marked as x°.
Let us denote the angles 55° and 75° as Angle(A) and Angle(B) respectively and the required angle as Angle(C). The figure includes intersecting lines.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The diagram contains angles with measurements 55°, 75°, and x°. We need to identify any angle relationships between these angles. The angle x is formed by two intersecting lines.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicit markings for congruent triangles or equal lengths/angles in the diagram.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The two lines forming angle 'x' intersect with the sides of larger triangles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The angles 55° and 75° are exterior angles to a triangle containing angle x. The lines that form the angle 'x' intersect the lines which form the angles 55 and 75 degrees. Let the triangle which contains angle x at one of its vertices be denoted as triangle ABC. The angles 55 and 75 degrees are exterior angles of this triangle. Let the other two angles of this triangle be y and z. Then 55 = z + x and 75 = y + x. Since the sum of all angles in triangle is 180. We can say that y + z + x = 180.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The goal is to determine the value of 'x'. The image shows two lines that create the angle 'x', and two other angles are provided. The predicates below capture the angle information provided in the image, the presence of triangles.
