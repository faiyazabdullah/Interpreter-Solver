PROBLEM 452 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line passes (2,-1), (5,1), (8,3), (11,5). Find the equation of the line in point-slope form .
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a line passing through the points (2, -1), (5, 1), (8, 3), and (11, 5) on a coordinate plane. The x and y axes are labeled.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The line is not horizontal or vertical, so it is not perpendicular to either the x or y axis.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The distances between the consecutive points on the line are equal.
(5,1) - (2,-1) = (3,2)
(8,3) - (5,1) = (3,2)
(11,5) - (8,3) = (3,2)

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The line intersects the y-axis at (0, -7/3). The line intersects the x-axis at (3.5, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The slope of the line can be determined by using two points on the line. Using (2, -1) and (5, 1), the slope is (1 - (-1)) / (5 - 2) = 2/3.
The equation of the line is y = (2/3)x + b. Substituting (2, -1) into the equation: -1 = (2/3)(2) + b. b = -1 - 4/3 = -7/3.
The equation of the line is y = (2/3)x - 7/3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The key geometric relationships between the points and the line are identified.
