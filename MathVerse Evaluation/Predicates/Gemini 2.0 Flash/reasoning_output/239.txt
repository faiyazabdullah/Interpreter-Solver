PROBLEM 239 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In triangle A B C, R, S, T are midpoints of A C, A B, and C B. A T, B R, and C S intersect at M. M C = 7, R M = 4, and A T = 16. Find M B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with points R, S, and T on the sides AC, AB, and CB respectively.
- Lines AT, BR, and CS intersect at point M.
- AR = RC, AS = SB, CT = TB. This means R, S, and T are midpoints.
- MC = 7, RM = 4, AT = 16.
- The lines AT, BR, CS are medians of the triangle.
- M is the centroid of the triangle.
- We want to find the length of MB.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no right angles or perpendicular lines explicitly indicated in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AR = RC, AS = SB, CT = TB due to R, S, T being midpoints.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- AT, BR, CS intersect at M, which is the centroid.
- R is the midpoint of AC, so AR = RC.
- S is the midpoint of AB, so AS = SB.
- T is the midpoint of CB, so CT = TB.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since M is the centroid, we know that AM = (2/3)AT, BM = (2/3)BR, and CM = (2/3)CS. Also, AT is a median, BR is a median, and CS is a median.
- Also, we have AM = AT - MT, BM = BR - MR, CM = CS - MS.
- Given AT = 16, then AM = (2/3)*16 = 32/3, and MT = (1/3)*16 = 16/3.
- Since M is the centroid, we have BM = 2*MR. Thus, BM = 2*4 = 8.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the key relationships required to solve the problem.
