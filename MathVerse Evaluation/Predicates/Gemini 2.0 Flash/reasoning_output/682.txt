PROBLEM 682 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: All edges of the base of the following square pyramid are 8 cm long, while all the sloping edges are 12 cm long. The CN edge and DN edge have the equal length.
Find Y, the size of \angle PNM, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a square pyramid P-ABCD. The base ABCD is a square. All edges of the base are 8 cm long. The sloping edges PA, PB, PC, and PD are 12 cm long. Point M is the intersection of diagonals AC and BD of the square base. CN = ND. We want to find the size of angle PNM.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this problem.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The base ABCD is a square, so all angles are right angles (90 degrees). M is the intersection of the diagonals of the square. PM is perpendicular to the base ABCD.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Since ABCD is a square, AB = BC = CD = DA = 8. Also, PA = PB = PC = PD = 12. M is the midpoint of AC and BD. CN = ND.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
M is the intersection of AC and BD. N is the midpoint of CD.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since ABCD is a square, AC and BD are perpendicular bisectors of each other. PM is perpendicular to the base, so PM is perpendicular to AC and BD. Since N is the midpoint of CD, then DN = NC = 4.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We need to capture all the geometric properties and relationships so the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving.
