PROBLEM 141 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: While measuring the height of the building, Xiao Ming first measured the shadow length BA of the building on the ground as 15.0 (as shown in the figure), and then set up a benchmark with a height of 2.0 at A, and measured the shadow length AC of the benchmark as 3.0, then the height of the building is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a building, a benchmark, and the ground.
- Points: A, B, C
- Lines: AB, AC, BC, representing the ground, the height of the benchmark, and the shadow of the benchmark. Also, the height of the building.
- Measurements: AC = 3.0, AB = 15.0, height of benchmark at A = 2.0
- The building is perpendicular to the ground (BC). The benchmark is perpendicular to the ground (BC). This implies that the triangle formed by the benchmark, its shadow, and the line of sight to the top of the building is similar to the triangle formed by the building, its shadow, and the line of sight to the top of the building.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is a right angle. The building is perpendicular to the ground BC.
- The line representing the benchmark at A is perpendicular to the ground BC. So, there is a right angle at A.
- Let's say there is a point D at the top of the building, so the line of sight CD creates an angle at C.
- Let's say there is a point E at the top of the benchmark, so the line of sight CE creates an angle at C. The measure of these angles is the same, so angle DCE = angle ACE.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two triangles (one with the benchmark and its shadow, and the other with the building and its shadow) are similar.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The ground BC intersects with the lines representing the heights of the benchmark and the building at A and B respectively.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We have two similar right triangles. The ratio of the height of the benchmark to the length of its shadow is equal to the ratio of the height of the building to the length of its shadow.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the key relationships and measurements required to determine the height of the building.
