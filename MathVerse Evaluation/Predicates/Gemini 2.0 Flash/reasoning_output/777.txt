PROBLEM 777 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, points A and B lie on the circle with center O. If x = 80, what is the value of z?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a circle with center O.
- Points A and B are on the circle.
- Lines OA and OB are radii of the circle.
- Line AB is a chord of the circle.
- An angle x is formed at point A between line OA and chord AB.
- An angle z is formed at point B between line OB and chord AB.
- An external angle of 80 degrees is formed at point A, supplementary to angle x.
- We are given x = 80.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: O
- Points on circle: A, B
- Radii: OA, OB
- Chord: AB
- No inscribed angles are explicitly marked.
- Since OA and OB are radii, LengthOf(OA) = LengthOf(OB).

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle x and the 80-degree angle are supplementary.
- Therefore, x + 80 = 180. Thus x = 100.
- Since OA = OB, triangle OAB is isosceles, and angle OAB = angle OBA.
- So, Angle(OAB) = Angle(OBA). Also Angle(OAB) = x. Thus angle OBA = x.
- Angle x is given outside the triangle OAB as the supplementary angle, 80 degrees is its supplementary angle, so the interior angle at A is 180 - 80 = 100 degrees.
Thus the measure of angle OAB is 100, therefore x is 100.
- Since OA = OB, Triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle. Thus Angle(OAB) = Angle(OBA). Therefore, Angle(OBA) = z = 100/2
Thus z = 50 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB, because both are radii of the same circle.
- Angle OAB = Angle OBA = x.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- A and B lie on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle OAB is isosceles because OA = OB.
- Therefore, angle OAB = angle OBA = z.
- Angle A + 80 = 180 so angle A = 100
- Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, Angle AOB + Angle OAB + Angle OBA = 180.
- Thus, Angle AOB + x + z = 180. Since x = z, AOB + 2z = 180.
- Given x = 80, therefore the angle OAB is supplementary to x (80 degrees), which makes OAB=180-80=100.
Therefore angle OAB =100 degrees.
So angle OBA is also equal to 100.
Therefore 2(100) + angle AOB > 180 degrees. Therefore, the given angle is an external angle of A that is 80 degrees
x+ 80 = 180 , so x=100.
Since OA = OB, Triangle(OAB) is Isosceles and z=x. 2z+angle(AOB)=180.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Identified all necessary geometric relationships to solve for z.
