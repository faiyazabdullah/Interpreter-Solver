PROBLEM 611 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What does the average rate of change tell you?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with the x-axis representing years and the y-axis representing the number of earthquakes.
- The graph contains points at (1, 6), (2, 6), (3, 6), and (4, 6).
- A horizontal line connects these points.
- The x-axis ranges from 0 to 4 and is labeled "year".
- The y-axis ranges from 0 to 10 and is labeled "number of earthquakes".
- The line is horizontal, indicating a constant number of earthquakes per year.

STEP 2: LINE ANALYSIS
- A horizontal line is defined by the points on the graph.
- The y-value is constant at 6.
- The average rate of change is 0.
