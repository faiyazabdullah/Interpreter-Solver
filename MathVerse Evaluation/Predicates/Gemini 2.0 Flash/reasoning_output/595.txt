PROBLEM 595 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line passes (0,-5) and (5,0). Find the equation of the line.
Use exact numbers.
y = _ x + _
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: The image shows a straight line on a Cartesian plane.
- Points: The line passes through the points (0, -5) and (5, 0).
- Measurements: The x and y axes are labeled. We can determine the slope and y-intercept of the line.
- Special markings: None.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as there are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as the line's angle with respect to the x-axis is not explicitly given.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the y-axis at (0, -5).
- The line intersects the x-axis at (5, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can determine the slope of the line using the two given points.
- We can use the slope-intercept form of a line to find its equation.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The two given points are sufficient to find the equation of the line.
