PROBLEM 566 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening upward with a vertex of (3,âˆ’8) and a minimum value of -8. f(x)=x^2-2x+1. Which function has a greater y-intercept, f(x) or g(x)?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph of a parabola. The axes are labeled as x and y. The parabola is labeled as y=g(x). The vertex of the parabola is at (3,-8). The y-intercept of f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 is found by setting x=0, giving f(0) = 1. We need to find the y-intercept of g(x). Since we know the vertex of g(x) is at (3,-8), the equation is in the form g(x) = a(x-3)^2 - 8. Looking at the graph, the point (0, 1) is NOT on g(x). But the graph passes through (6, 1). So g(6) = a(6-3)^2 - 8 = 1. Thus 9a - 8 = 1, so 9a = 9, which means a=1. Therefore, g(x) = (x-3)^2 - 8. To find the y-intercept of g(x), we set x=0. Then g(0) = (0-3)^2 - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1.

STEP 2: Y-INTERCEPT ANALYSIS
f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 has a y-intercept of f(0) = 0^2 - 2(0) + 1 = 1.
g(x) has a vertex at (3, -8) and passes through (6, 1). g(x) = a(x-3)^2 - 8.
g(6) = a(6-3)^2 - 8 = 1.  9a - 8 = 1.  9a = 9. a = 1.
Therefore, g(x) = (x-3)^2 - 8. The y-intercept of g(x) is g(0) = (0-3)^2 - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1.
Since both functions have the same y-intercept of 1, neither function has a greater y-intercept.

STEP 3: PREDICATE GENERATION
Now, let's represent all the information in the diagram using geometric predicates.
I will assume that the plotted points are accurate enough to calculate g(x).

PREDICATES:
Point(O)
PointLiesOnLine(O,Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine(O,Line(y,x))
Shape(g(x))
Vertex(Shape(g(x)),Point(V))
Equals(V,(3,-8))
PointLiesOnShape(Point((6,1)),Shape(g(x)))
Function(f(x))
Equals(f(x),(x^2-2x+1))
Function(g(x))
Equals(g(x),((x-3)^2-8))
Equals(g(0),1)
Equals(f(0),1)
Equals(f(0),g(0))
