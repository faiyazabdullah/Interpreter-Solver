PROBLEM 755 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The figure above shows six right triangles. They are put together to form an irregular figure. What is the value of x^2 + y^2?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains six right triangles arranged to form an irregular figure.
- Each triangle has two legs labeled.
- The lengths of the legs for each triangle are as follows:
    - Triangle 1: legs are $\sqrt{3}$ and $\sqrt{3}$
    - Triangle 2: legs are $\sqrt{10}$ and $\sqrt{7}$
    - Triangle 3: legs are $2$ and $\sqrt{6}$
    - Triangle 4: legs are $x$ and $y$
- All the triangles are right triangles.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Each triangle has a right angle.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The lengths of the legs are given as $\sqrt{3}$, $\sqrt{10}$, $\sqrt{7}$, $2$, $\sqrt{6}$, $x$, and $y$.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The right triangles share a common vertex.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can apply the Pythagorean theorem to each of the right triangles.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The question asks for the value of $x^2 + y^2$.
- The Pythagorean theorem states that $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, where a and b are the legs of a right triangle, and c is the hypotenuse.
- Triangle 1: $(\sqrt{3})^2 + (\sqrt{3})^2 = c_1^2$, so $c_1^2 = 3 + 3 = 6$
- Triangle 2: $(\sqrt{10})^2 + (\sqrt{7})^2 = c_2^2$, so $c_2^2 = 10 + 7 = 17$
- Triangle 3: $(2)^2 + (\sqrt{6})^2 = c_3^2$, so $c_3^2 = 4 + 6 = 10$
- Triangle 4: $x^2 + y^2 = c_4^2$
- From the diagram, the hypotenuses of the triangles form an inner quadrilateral, which consists of four sides where the length of the side represents the hypotenuse of the outer triangles. We can form a large triangle formed by the union of the outer triangles, therefore $c_1, c_2, c_3, x^2 + y^2$ are not related.
