PROBLEM 506 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Write an equation for the transformation of f(x)=|x| as shown in the figure, which passes (3, 3) and are piecewise.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a V-shaped graph.
- The graph intersects the x-axis at (2, -1) and (4, -1).
- The vertex of the V-shape is at (3, 3).
- The V-shape looks like an absolute value function that has been transformed.
- The function appears to be piecewise.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is no explicit angle information given.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two lines that make up the sides of the V are of equal length from (3,3) to (2,-1) and from (3,3) to (4,-1).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The graph passes through (2,-1), (3,3), and (4, -1).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph is a transformation of the absolute value function.
- The function is symmetric around x=3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates below represent the graph and known points.
