PROBLEM 492 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph of a cubic function  f  is shown in Figure 18 with a labeled point (1.333, 5.185) at its right part. Based on the calculator screen shot, the point  (1.333,5.185)  is which of the following?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph of a cubic function on a calculator screen. The coordinate axes are visible. A point is marked on the curve with coordinates x = 1.3333324 and y = 5.1851852. This point is labeled as a maximum. The figure also has a label at the bottom left corner as Figure 18.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicit congruence or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The point (1.3333324, 5.1851852) lies on the curve.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The image suggests that the marked point is a local maximum of the cubic function.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The necessary geometric relationships are present, specifically the coordinates of the point that is identified as the maximum.
