PROBLEM 040 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, it is known that the straight lines a and b are intercepted by the straight line c, a parallel b, angle 1 = 50.0, then angle 2 = ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two parallel lines, a and b, intersected by a transversal line c.
- There are two angles labeled: angle 1 and angle 2.
- The measure of angle 1 is given as 50 degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 is 50 degrees.
- Angle 2 is an unknown angle that needs to be determined.
- Since line a and line b are parallel, angle 1 and an angle adjacent to angle 2 are corresponding angles and therefore equal.
- Angle 2 and the angle adjacent to it are supplementary angles.
- The supplementary angles of angle 1 is 180-50 = 130
- Angle 2 is the supplementary of this angle and is therefore = 130 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked congruent shapes.
- Due to the parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line c intersects line a and line b.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- a parallel b
- Angle 1 and angle 2 can be related using properties of parallel lines and transversals.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The diagram shows the relationship between the two lines. The angle is marked, lines are parallel and the solution can be worked out from that.
