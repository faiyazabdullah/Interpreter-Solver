Question: There is a quadratic function going through (-2,1), (-1,2), (0,1). Write an equation for the graphed function f.

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a parabola. We can identify three points on the parabola: (-2, 1), (-1, 2), and (0, 1). The task is to find the equation of the parabola. The general form of a quadratic equation is y = ax^2 + bx + c. We can substitute the coordinates of the three points to create a system of equations to solve for a, b, and c.

STEP 2: EQUATION FORMATION
Substituting (-2, 1) into y = ax^2 + bx + c gives 1 = 4a - 2b + c
Substituting (-1, 2) into y = ax^2 + bx + c gives 2 = a - b + c
Substituting (0, 1) into y = ax^2 + bx + c gives 1 = c

STEP 3: SOLVING FOR COEFFICIENTS
Since c = 1, the first two equations become:
1 = 4a - 2b + 1  => 4a - 2b = 0 => 2a - b = 0 => b = 2a
2 = a - b + 1  => a - b = 1
Substitute b = 2a into a - b = 1 gives a - 2a = 1 => -a = 1 => a = -1
Then b = 2a = 2(-1) = -2
Thus, a = -1, b = -2, c = 1

STEP 4: FINAL EQUATION
The equation of the parabola is y = -x^2 - 2x + 1
