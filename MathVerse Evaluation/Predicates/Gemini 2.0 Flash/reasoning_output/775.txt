PROBLEM 775 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The perimeter of the rectangle above is p and the area of the rectangle is 36. If l and w are integers, what is one possible value of p?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle with sides labeled as 'l inches' and 'w inches'.
- The perimeter of the rectangle is 'p'.
- The area of the rectangle is given as 36.
- 'l' and 'w' are integers.
- The figure is not drawn to scale.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangle has four right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Opposite sides of the rectangle are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides of the rectangle intersect at the vertices, forming right angles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the rectangle is given by l * w = 36.
- The perimeter of the rectangle is given by p = 2l + 2w.
- Since l and w are integers, we can find possible values of l and w such that l * w = 36. Possible pairs are (1, 36), (2, 18), (3, 12), (4, 9), (6, 6).
- For each pair, we can calculate the perimeter:
    - (1, 36): p = 2(1) + 2(36) = 2 + 72 = 74
    - (2, 18): p = 2(2) + 2(18) = 4 + 36 = 40
    - (3, 12): p = 2(3) + 2(12) = 6 + 24 = 30
    - (4, 9): p = 2(4) + 2(9) = 8 + 18 = 26
    - (6, 6): p = 2(6) + 2(6) = 12 + 12 = 24

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The problem asks for one possible value of p. We have several possible values of p (74, 40, 30, 26, 24).
- The predicates below should capture all relevant information.

Rectangle(Rectangle1)
