PROBLEM 483 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a curve goes through (-4,0), (0,2), and (4,0). The points at (-4,0) and (4,0) are both solid points. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a curve on a coordinate plane. The curve intersects the x-axis at x=-4 and x=4, and has a maximum at (0, 2). The points (-4,0) and (4,0) are solid, indicating they are included in the function.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The domain of the function is the set of all x-values for which the function is defined. In this case, the function is defined from x=-4 to x=4, inclusive. So the domain is [-4, 4].
The range of the function is the set of all y-values that the function takes on. In this case, the function takes on values from y=0 to y=2, inclusive. So the range is [0, 2].

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified the domain and range of the function based on the image provided.

PREDICATES:

Point(C)
PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(x_axis, y_axis))
PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(x_axis, y_axis))
PointLiesOnLine(C, Line(x_axis, y_axis))
Equals(A, (-4,0))
Equals(B, (0,2))
Equals(C, (4,0))
PointLiesOnCurve(A, Curve)
PointLiesOnCurve(B, Curve)
PointLiesOnCurve(C, Curve)
Domain=[-4,4]
Range=[0,2]
