PROBLEM 642 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The figure shows $\frac{3}{4}$ of a cylinder. The height is 15 centimeters and radius is 5 centimeters. Find the volume of the figure shown, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a portion of a cylinder, specifically $\frac{3}{4}$ of a cylinder.
- The radius of the cylinder is 5 cm.
- The height (length) of the cylinder is 15 cm.
- There are straight lines and curved lines in the figure.
- A portion of two circles are present.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is explicitly stated as 5 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The cylinder portion removed is $\frac{1}{4}$ of the cylinder, implying right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius is constant.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Points intersect to form the solid.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the given shape is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the volume of a full cylinder.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Radius and height are defined and the figure is $\frac{3}{4}$ of a cylinder.
