PROBLEM 589 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph of logarithm function $f(x)=\ln x$ (gray) and logarithm function $g(x)$ (black) is drawn below. $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$.

What sort of transformation is $g(x)$ of $f(x)$ ?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two logarithmic curves, one in gray which is identified as $f(x) = \ln x$, and another in black which is a transformation, $g(x)$ of $f(x)$. The axes $x$ and $y$ are shown. An arrow and the expression $f(x)=\ln x$ are also shown in the image. The graph $g(x)$ is shifted upward as compared to graph $f(x)$.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Visually, the shape of the curves looks identical, which means that the transformation is a vertical shift.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since the black curve $g(x)$ has same shape as the gray curve $f(x)$, it must be a transformation of $f(x)$. Looking at the relative position, $g(x)$ is simply a vertical shift of $f(x)$.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The crucial information needed to describe the geometrical figure is the relationship between the two curves.
