PROBLEM 523 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Piecewise functions $f$ and $g$ can model the heights (in meters) of two airplanes. $g$ is purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), and $f$ is blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). $t$ is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport. Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection points of the graphs?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two piecewise functions, $f$ and $g$, plotted on a coordinate plane. The x-axis represents time $t$ in minutes, and the y-axis represents height in meters. The function $g$ is represented by a purple line and $f$ by a blue line. The graph is a series of line segments. Key points on $g$ are (0, 10000), (40, 9000), (80, 9000), and (100, 11000). Key points on $f$ are (10, 11000), (50, 11000), (60, 10000), (100, 10000), and (120, 0). The intersection points of the graphs represent times when the two airplanes are at the same height.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The axes appear to be perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No explicit markings indicate congruence or equality. However, horizontal line segments imply equal heights over some time intervals.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The graphs intersect at one point approximately where $t=90$, $y=10000$

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The functions $f$ and $g$ describe the height of two airplanes over time. The intersection of these two graphs gives the time when the height of two airplanes is equal.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The task is to represent the geometric relationships. The main features are piecewise functions, line segments, and intersection points. The provided points should describe the graphs.
