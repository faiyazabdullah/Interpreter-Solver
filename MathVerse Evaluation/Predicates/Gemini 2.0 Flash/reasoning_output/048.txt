PROBLEM 048 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, A, B, C are any three points on circle O, if angle BOC = 100.0, then the degree of angle BAC is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a circle with center O.
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.
- There's an angle BOC at the center of the circle and an angle BAC formed by points on the circle.
- Measurement of angle BOC is given as 100 degrees.
- Quadrilateral BOAC is formed by connecting the points.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- O is the center of the circle.
- A, B, and C are points on the circle.
- OB, OC, and OA are radii.
- Angle BOC is a central angle.
- Angle BAC is an inscribed angle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BOC = 100 degrees.
- We need to find angle BAC. The relationship between the central angle and inscribed angle is important here.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OB = OC = OA because they are radii of the same circle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines OB, OC, and OA intersect at point O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Angle BAC is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc BC as the central angle BOC.  Therefore, the measure of angle BAC is either half the measure of angle BOC or 180 degrees minus half the measure of angle BOC.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the necessary information to solve the problem.
