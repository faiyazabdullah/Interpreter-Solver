PROBLEM 597 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A system of two equations: $x^2+y^2=9$ and $y=x^2-4$ and their graphs in the 
xy-plane are shown above. How many solutions 
does the system have?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle and a parabola graphed on the xy-plane. The equation of the circle is $x^2 + y^2 = 9$ and the equation of the parabola is $y = x^2 - 4$. We need to determine the number of solutions to the system of equations, which corresponds to the number of intersection points between the circle and the parabola. Visually, there appear to be four intersection points.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The circle is centered at the origin (0, 0) and has a radius of 3.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked angles or perpendicular relationships in the diagram. However, the coordinate axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The diagram exhibits symmetry about the y-axis for both the circle and the parabola.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The graphs of the circle and the parabola intersect at four distinct points.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The number of intersection points between the circle and parabola visually indicate the number of solutions to the given system of equations.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The key observation is the number of intersection points.
