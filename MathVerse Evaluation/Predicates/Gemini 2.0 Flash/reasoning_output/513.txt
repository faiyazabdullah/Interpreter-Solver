PROBLEM 513 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The x-intercept of the line is -1.5 and the y-intercept is 3. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a line in a coordinate plane. The x-axis and y-axis are shown. The line passes through the points (0,3) and (-1.5, 0), which are the y-intercept and x-intercept, respectively. The region above the line is shaded.
The line is solid, implying the inequality is inclusive (either >= or <=).
The shaded region is above the line, suggesting the inequality involves '>='.

STEP 2: Identify the equation of the line
The equation of the line can be found using the slope-intercept form y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.
The y-intercept is 3, so c = 3.
The slope m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (3 - 0) / (0 - (-1.5)) = 3 / 1.5 = 2.
Thus, the equation of the line is y = 2x + 3.

STEP 3: Identify the inequality
Since the shaded region is above the line and the line is solid, the inequality is y >= 2x + 3.
Rewriting, we get 2x - y <= -3 or y - 2x >= 3.
