PROBLEM 463 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.

Find the centre of the circle. Write your answer in the form ( _ , _ ).
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a circle on a coordinate plane.
- The x and y axes are visible.
- There is a point at the center of the circle.
- The circle intersects the x and y axes.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The circle's center appears to be at (-3,-3).
- The radius of the circle appears to be 2.
- Points on the circle appear to be around (-5,-3), (-1,-3), (-3,-1), (-3,-5)

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal markings are visible.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The circle intersects the x-axis at roughly (-5,0) and (-1,0).
- The circle intersects the y-axis at roughly (0,-1) and (0,-5).
- The center of the circle is at (-3, -3).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The distance from the center to any point on the circle is the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates below capture the center and presence of the circle.
