PROBLEM 474 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a number line with two labeled points at -2 and 1.
- A solid line segment connects these points.
- The point at -2 is represented by an open circle, indicating it's not included in the interval.
- The point at 1 is represented by a closed circle, indicating it's included in the interval.
- Arrows are present on either end of the number line indicating it extends infinitely in both directions.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are two circles, one open and one closed, on the number line.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- N/A

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- N/A

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The points -2 and 1 lie on the number line.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The solid line segment indicates the set of numbers between -2 and 1, excluding -2 and including 1.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information needed to express the interval is present. The image represents the interval (-2, 1].
