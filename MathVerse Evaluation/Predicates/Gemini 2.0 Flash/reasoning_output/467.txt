PROBLEM 467 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the graph of the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, below.

State the equation of the circle shown in the graph.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle centered approximately at (1, -4). The circle intersects the x-axis at approximately -1 and 3. The circle intersects the y-axis at approximately -1 and -7.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The circle's center appears to be at (1, -4). The radius appears to be 3. Therefore, the equation of the circle is (x-1)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 9. The circle passes through points that are approximately (-1,-4), (3,-4), (1,-1), and (1,-7). These points are on the circle, a distance of 3 from the center (1, -4).

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
No specific angles or perpendicular relationships are explicitly marked in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
All radii of the circle are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The circle intersects the x and y axes.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The equation of a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2. In this case, h=1, k=-4 and r=3, so the equation is (x-1)^2 + (y+4)^2 = 9

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The center and radius of the circle need to be determined to find the equation.

PREDICATES:
Circle(1)
PointLiesOnCircle(Point((3,-4)),Circle(1))
PointLiesOnCircle(Point((-1,-4)),Circle(1))
PointLiesOnCircle(Point((1,-1)),Circle(1))
PointLiesOnCircle(Point((1,-7)),Circle(1))
Equals(3,RadiusOf(Circle(1)))
Equals(1,RadiusOf(Circle(1)))
Equals(-4,RadiusOf(Circle(1)))
