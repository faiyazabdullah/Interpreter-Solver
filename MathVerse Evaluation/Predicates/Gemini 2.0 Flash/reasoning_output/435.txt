PROBLEM 435 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Given the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at -0.5 and -3.5 and with y-axis at 2, determine its equation.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows an ellipse in the Cartesian coordinate system.
- The ellipse intersects the x-axis at approximately -0.5 and -3.5.
- The ellipse intersects the y-axis at approximately 2.
- The center of the ellipse appears to be at approximately (-2, 2).
- The major axis appears to be vertical.
- The length of the semi-major axis is approximately 3 (from -1 to 5).
- The length of the semi-minor axis is approximately 1.5 (from -3.5 to -0.5, half is 1.5).

STEP 2: ELLIPSE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center of the ellipse: Approximately (-2, 2)
- Semi-major axis: 3
- Semi-minor axis: 1.5

STEP 3: EQUATION FORMULATION
The general form of an ellipse centered at (h, k) with semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b is:
((x-h)^2 / b^2) + ((y-k)^2 / a^2) = 1
In this case, h = -2, k = 2, a = 3, and b = 1.5.
((x+2)^2 / 1.5^2) + ((y-2)^2 / 3^2) = 1
((x+2)^2 / 2.25) + ((y-2)^2 / 9) = 1

STEP 4: PREDICATE GENERATION

Geometric predicates:
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-0.5), Line(x,0))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-3.5), Line(x,0))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,2), Line(0,y))

STEP 5: Final Predicates

```
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-0.5), Line(x,0))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-3.5), Line(x,0))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,2), Line(0,y))
```
