PROBLEM 590 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line, which is parallel to y-axis, passes (6,0). What is the slope of the line?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a vertical line on a coordinate plane. The x-axis and y-axis are present. The line appears to pass through the point (6, 0). The line is parallel to the y-axis.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The line is perpendicular to the x-axis.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Not applicable

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The line intersects the x-axis at (6, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The line is parallel to the y-axis, therefore the slope of the line is undefined.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All information has been captured.
