PROBLEM 493 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a piecewise function combind by straight lines going through (3, -2), (1, 0), and (0,1). Write an equation for the graphed function f.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure contains a piecewise function composed of two line segments.
- Key points on the graph are approximately (-3, 4), (0, 1), (1, 0), (3, -2), and (5,0).
- The function is continuous and consists of two linear segments joined at (3,-2).

STEP 2: LINE SEGMENT ANALYSIS
- The first line segment extends from approximately (-3, 4) to (3, -2).
- The second line segment extends from (3, -2) to (5, 0).

STEP 3: SLOPE CALCULATION
- Slope of the first segment:  (4 - (-2)) / (-3 - 3) = 6 / -6 = -1
- Slope of the second segment: (0 - (-2)) / (5 - 3) = 2 / 2 = 1

STEP 4: EQUATION FORMULATION
- For x < 3, the line passes through (0, 1), with a slope of -1. Equation: y = -x + 1
- For x > 3, the line passes through (5, 0), with a slope of 1. Equation: y = x - 5

STEP 5: VERTEX DEFINITION
- Point (3, -2) is the vertex of the piecewise function.

STEP 6: SYNTHESIS
- The function f(x) is defined piecewise.
- f(x) = -x + 1 if x < 1 and x > -infinity.
- f(x) = x - 5 if x > 3 and x < infinity.
- Also between x >=1 and x <= 3. f(x) = a function between them.
Based on the slopes we get y = -x+1 for x <1, for x>3, y = x-5

STEP 7: FINAL FORM
The lines intersect at (1,0), thus,
f(x) = -x+1 for x <= 1, and f(x) = x-5 for x >= 3.
For the points between (1,0) and (3,-2), and the points on the other side which extend to the left the equation can be defined as y = -x+1 up to x = negative infinity and y=x-5 till positive infinity.
