PROBLEM 582 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For function graphed below, which is a curve whose asymptote is x-axis and x=4, determine if it has an inverse function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a function graph.
- The function appears to have a vertical asymptote at x=4 and a horizontal asymptote at y=0 (x-axis).
- The graph decreases as x approaches 4 from both sides.
- For x > 4, the graph is above the x-axis (y > 0).
- For x < 4, the graph is below the x-axis (y < 0).

STEP 2: Determine if it has an inverse function
The function is not one-to-one as horizontal line will intersect twice, thus it does not have inverse.

PREDICATES:
Line(x-axis)
Line(A,B)
Line(m)
PointLiesOnLine(Point(A),Line(x-axis))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(B),Line(x-axis))
Perpendicular(Line(x-axis),Line(m))
Equals(4,MeasureOf(m))
Equals(0,MeasureOf(x-axis))
