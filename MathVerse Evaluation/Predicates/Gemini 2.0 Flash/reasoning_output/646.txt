PROBLEM 646 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the cone pictured here. The perpendicular height is 12.5 centimeters and radius is 4.1 centimeters.

(Give your answer correct to 1 decimal place.)
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cone.
- A dotted line represents the height of the cone, labeled as 12.5 cm.
- A dotted line represents the radius of the base of the cone, labeled as 4.1 cm.
- A right angle symbol is shown at the intersection of the height and the radius.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone is a circle.
- The radius is 4.1 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height is perpendicular to the radius.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality markings are present.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The height intersects the base at the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height is perpendicular to the base.
- The radius is given as 4.1 cm and the height is given as 12.5 cm.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the information required to solve the problem is present.
