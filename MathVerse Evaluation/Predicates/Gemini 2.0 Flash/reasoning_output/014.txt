PROBLEM 014 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, triangle ABC is the inscribed triangle of circle O, angle OAB = 35.0, then the degree of angle ACB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center O.
- Triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle.
- Angle OAB is given as 35 degrees.
- Points A, B, C are on the circle.
- OA and OB are radii of the circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle(O)
- Points A, B, C lie on Circle(O).
- OA is a radius of Circle(O).
- OB is a radius of Circle(O).
- IsRadiusOf(Line(O, A), Circle(O))
- IsRadiusOf(Line(O, B), Circle(O))
- Equals(LengthOf(Line(O, A)), LengthOf(Line(O, B)))
- Angle ACB is an inscribed angle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle(O, A, B) = 35 degrees.
- MeasureOf(Angle(O, A, B)) = 35.0
- Angle AOB is a central angle.
- Angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtended by arc AB.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB since they are radii of the same circle.
- Triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle.
- Angle OBA = Angle OAB = 35 degrees.
- Angle AOB = 180 - (35 + 35) = 110 degrees.
- The inscribed angle ACB is half of the central angle AOB.
- ACB = 1/2 * AOB = 1/2 * 110 = 55 degrees.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines AB, BC, and AC intersect the circle at points A, B, and C, respectively.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since triangle OAB is isosceles, Angle OAB = Angle OBA.
- Angle AOB = 180 - 2 * Angle OAB.
- Angle ACB = 1/2 * Angle AOB (inscribed angle theorem).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
