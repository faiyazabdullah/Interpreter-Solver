PROBLEM 573 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2 in blue. Write the equation for g(x).
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see two parabolas: one blue, labeled 'f', and one red (dashed), labeled 'g'.
- The blue parabola f(x) = x^2 has its vertex at (0, 0).
- The red parabola 'g' appears to be a translation of 'f'.
- The vertex of the red parabola 'g' appears to be at (-2, 1).
- The graph is on a coordinate plane with x and y axes.
- The visible range of x is from -7 to 7 and y from -7 to 7.
- There are grid lines at integer coordinates.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The shape of the parabolas is the same, suggesting they are congruent through translation.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Vertex of f is at (0,0)
- Vertex of g is at (-2,1)

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The red parabola 'g' is a translation of the blue parabola 'f'.  The translation moves the vertex from (0,0) to (-2, 1).
- This means the function g(x) is f(x+2) + 1, so g(x) = (x+2)^2 + 1

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the key geometric shapes and their relationship. We have identified their locations, and the nature of the transformation. We have all needed elements to create the requested equation.
