PROBLEM 265 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Three lines l, m, and p intersect at two points and form eights angles. Line l and m are parallel. If m \angle 5 = 7 x - 5 and m \angle 4 = 2 x + 23, find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows three lines l, m, and p intersecting at two points. Lines l and m are parallel. There are eight angles formed by the intersections. The measures of angle 5 and angle 4 are given as 7x-5 and 2x+23, respectively.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angles 4 and 5 are same-side interior angles. Since lines l and m are parallel, angles 4 and 5 are supplementary.

STEP 3: EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Since lines l and m are parallel, the sum of angles 4 and 5 is 180.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Line p intersects lines l and m at two different points.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since angles 4 and 5 are supplementary, their sum equals 180. Therefore, (2x+23) + (7x-5) = 180.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates capture the relationships between the angles and the parallel lines, as well as the given measurements.

PREDICATES:
PointLiesOnLine(Point(4),Line(l))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(4),Line(p))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(5),Line(m))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(5),Line(p))
