PROBLEM 774 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, a+b = 54, and one of the angles is 126°. What is the value of x?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a geometric figure composed of two overlapping triangles. The smaller triangle is positioned inside the larger triangle.
- Points: No points are explicitly labeled in the diagram. The angles are labeled a°, b°, 126°, and x°.
- Lines: The lines form the sides of the two triangles.
- Angles: There are angles a, b, 126, and x. The problem also states that a+b = 54.
- Measurements: Angle values a, b, 126, x. The sum of a and b is given as 54.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The diagram shows several angles. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180°. Therefore, in the smaller triangle, a + b + 126 = 180. In the larger triangle, a + b + x = 180.
Since a + b = 54, we have 54 + 126 = 180, and 54 + x = 180. Therefore, x = 180 - 54 = 126.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicit congruence or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The lines intersect to form the vertices of the two triangles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°.  We are given a + b = 54, and one angle is 126°.  We have a + b + 126 = 180, so 54 + 126 = 180, which is true. The larger triangle also has angles a, b, and x. Thus, a + b + x = 180, which means 54 + x = 180.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates should include the facts that the sum of the angles in each triangle is 180, and that a+b=54.
