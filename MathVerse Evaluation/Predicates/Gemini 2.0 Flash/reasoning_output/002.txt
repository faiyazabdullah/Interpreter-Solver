PROBLEM 002 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, straight line EF intersects AB at point E, intersects CD at point F, EG bisects angle BEF, and it intersects CD at point G, angle 1 = 50.0, then angle 2 is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: Lines, angles
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G
- Lines: AB, CD, EF, EG
- Angles: Angle 1, Angle 2, Angle BEF
- Measurements: Angle 1 = 50.0 degrees
- Special Markings: AB parallel to CD, EG bisects angle BEF

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 is an angle formed by lines EF and CD.
- Angle 2 is an angle formed by lines EG and CD.
- Angle BEF is an angle formed by lines AB and EF.
- EG bisects angle BEF, meaning the two angles formed by EG are equal.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB is parallel to CD.
- Measure of angle 1 is 50 degrees.
- EG bisects angle BEF.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- EF intersects AB at E and CD at F.
- EG intersects CD at G.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is parallel to CD, angle AEF and angle 1 are supplementary. Also, angle BEF and angle 1 are supplementary.
- Since EG bisects angle BEF, angle BEG is equal to angle GEF.
- Angle 2 and angle CGE are vertical angles. Therefore they are equal.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information has been captured. The relationships between the angles formed by the parallel lines and the angle bisector are present.
