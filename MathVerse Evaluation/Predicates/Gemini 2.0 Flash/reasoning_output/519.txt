PROBLEM 519 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The function $f(x)=5 x-x^2$ in blue gives the number of mosquitos in the forest (in millions), and the function $g(x)=3 x-0.5 x^2$ in red gives the number of bats (in millions). In both equations $x$ represents rainfall (in centimeters). $g(x)$ goes through (0,0), (3,6), (6,0) and opens downward. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,0), (2,6), (3,6), (5,0) and opens downsward. When there is $0 \mathrm{~cm}$ of rainfall, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats. What is another rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats?
Round your answer to the nearest half centimeter.

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two parabolas opening downwards. The blue parabola is labeled as $f(x) = 5x - x^2$ and the red parabola is labeled as $g(x) = 3x - 0.5x^2$. Both parabolas pass through the origin (0,0).
The blue parabola f(x) appears to intersect the x-axis at x=5, and its vertex seems to be around x=2.5. The red parabola g(x) appears to intersect the x-axis at x=6, and its vertex seems to be around x=3.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes appear to be perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruent or equal shapes are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Both parabolas intersect at the origin (0,0). The blue parabola f(x) intersects the x-axis at approximately (5,0). The red parabola g(x) intersects the x-axis at approximately (6,0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The equations for the two parabolas are given. We need to find another point where the two parabolas intersect, meaning $f(x) = g(x)$.
$5x - x^2 = 3x - 0.5x^2$
$2x = 0.5x^2$
$4x = x^2$
$x^2 - 4x = 0$
$x(x-4) = 0$
$x = 0$ or $x = 4$
When $x=4$, $f(4) = 5(4) - 4^2 = 20 - 16 = 4$
When $x=4$, $g(4) = 3(4) - 0.5(4^2) = 12 - 0.5(16) = 12 - 8 = 4$
So, the other intersection point is (4,4).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified all the shapes, intersections and provided relevant relationships.
