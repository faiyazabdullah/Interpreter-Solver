PROBLEM 665 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the sphere shown. The diameter is 9 cm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sphere with a diameter labeled as 9 cm.
- The center of the sphere is marked.
- The task is to find the surface area of the sphere.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The figure represents a sphere, which is a 3D object, but the image shows a circle to represent it.
- The diameter is given as 9 cm, implying the radius is 4.5 cm.
- There are no inscribed angles, central angles, or arc relationships to consider.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit angles or perpendicular relationships shown in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All radii of the sphere are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The center of the sphere is the midpoint of the diameter.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The diameter is twice the radius. The surface area of a sphere is 4 * pi * r^2, where r is the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The diameter is given, from which the radius can be derived. The surface area formula can then be applied.
