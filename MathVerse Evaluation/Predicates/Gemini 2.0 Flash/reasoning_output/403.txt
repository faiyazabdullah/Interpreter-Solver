PROBLEM 403 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of the figure is $ 13 \mathrm{~mm}$. It follows that a two thirds of a circle has area $\frac{2}{3} \pi r^{2}$. Find the exact area of the shape shown, which is two thirds of a circle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sector of a circle with a central angle of 240 degrees.
- The radius of the sector is given as 13 mm.
- We want to find the area of this sector.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Radius of the circle is 13 mm.
- The central angle of the sector is 240 degrees.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The central angle is 240 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two radii of the sector are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- N/A

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the sector is $\frac{240}{360} \pi r^2 = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^2$, where r is the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The radius and the central angle are sufficient to calculate the area.
