PROBLEM 166 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in Rttriangle ABC, it is known that angle A = 90.0, AC = 3.0, AB = 4.0, then sinB is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC, with angle A being a right angle.
- Point A, B, and C are vertices of the triangle.
- AC has a length of 3.0, and AB has a length of 4.0.
- We need to extract all the information and relations about the triangle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle A is a right angle, meaning Line AC is perpendicular to Line AB.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal angles/sides are marked besides right angle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at points A, B and C to form the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle. We can apply the Pythagorean theorem: AB^2 + AC^2 = BC^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all necessary geometric properties.
