PROBLEM 456 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the circle on the graph. Its center at the origin and its radius is 7. State the equation of the circle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Circle
- Points: Center of circle at origin (0,0)
- Lines: x-axis, y-axis
- Measurements: Radius of the circle appears to be 7.
- Special markings: x and y axes, grid lines
- Implied constructions: radius

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: Origin (0,0)
- Points on the circle: Multiple points on the circle are visible, but not labeled
- Radius: 7 units (visually estimated)

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Axes are perpendicular

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All radii of the circle are equal in length

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Circle centered at origin
- Circle intersects x-axis at (-7,0) and (7,0)
- Circle intersects y-axis at (0,-7) and (0,7)

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Equation of the circle is x^2 + y^2 = r^2, where r=7. Therefore, x^2 + y^2 = 49

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The goal is to define the equation of the circle. We know the circle is centered at the origin (0,0), and the radius is 7.
- Therefore, x^2 + y^2 = 49
- The predicates should include the fact that the circle is centered at (0,0) and the radius is 7.
