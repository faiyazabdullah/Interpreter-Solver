PROBLEM 598 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The figure has two segments. Use the vertical line test to determine whether the curve is the graph of a function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a curve on a Cartesian plane. The curve appears to be composed of two segments. The vertical line test will be applied to determine whether the curve represents a function.

STEP 2: VERTICAL LINE TEST
The vertical line test states that if any vertical line intersects the curve more than once, then the curve does not represent a function. In this case, it is possible to draw a vertical line that intersects the curve at two distinct points. Therefore, the curve is not the graph of a function.

PREDICATES:
Shape(Curve1)
Shape(Curve2)
NOT(Function(Union(Curve1, Curve2)))
