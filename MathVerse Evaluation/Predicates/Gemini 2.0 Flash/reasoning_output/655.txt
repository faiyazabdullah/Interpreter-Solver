PROBLEM 655 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the following cylinder with a height of 35 cm and base radius of 10 cm. Find the surface area of the cylinder.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cylinder.
- The height of the cylinder is 35.
- The radius of the base is 10.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cylinder is a circle.
- The radius is 10.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The surface area of a cylinder is 2*pi*r^2 + 2*pi*r*h.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the radius and the height.
- We can calculate the surface area.
