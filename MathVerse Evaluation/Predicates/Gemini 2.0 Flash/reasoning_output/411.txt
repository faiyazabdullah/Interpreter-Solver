PROBLEM 411 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of the figure is $ 32.2 \mathrm{~m}$. The marked angle measures 344째. Consider the sector below. The marked angle measures 344째.

Calculate the perimeter of the sector. Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a circle with a sector removed.
- A radius of the circle is labeled as 32.2 m.
- The angle of the sector that remains is given as 344째.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There is a circle with a sector removed.
- The radius of the circle is given.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The marked angle is 344째.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two radii of the sector are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sector is defined by two radii meeting at the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The perimeter of the sector consists of two radii and the arc length. The arc length can be found from the radius and the central angle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- I have identified all necessary components to calculate the perimeter of the sector: the radius and the angle.
