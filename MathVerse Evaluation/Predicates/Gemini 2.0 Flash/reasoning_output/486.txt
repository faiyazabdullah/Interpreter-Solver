PROBLEM 486 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a hyperbolic function with its center at the origin. The graph approaches zero as $∣x∣$ increases, and the function is undefined at x=0. There are four points labeled at (1/6,6), (6,1/6), (-1/6,-6), (-6,-1/6). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a hyperbolic function with its center at the origin. The graph approaches zero as $∣x∣$ increases, and the function is undefined at x=0. There are four points labeled at (1/6,6), (6,1/6), (-1/6,-6), (-6,-1/6). The axes are x and y.

STEP 2: Determine Domain and Range
The domain of the hyperbolic function is all real numbers except 0. This can be expressed as $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$.
The range of the hyperbolic function is also all real numbers except 0. This can be expressed as $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$.
