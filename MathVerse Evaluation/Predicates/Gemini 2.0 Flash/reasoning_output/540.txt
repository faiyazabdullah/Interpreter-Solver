PROBLEM 540 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $(1.25,-2.75)$ and it has a minimum point at $(4.75,-6.25)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trigonometric function graph.
- Two points are labeled: (1.25, -2.75) and (4.75, -6.25).
- The point (1.25, -2.75) lies on the midline of the trigonometric function.
- The point (4.75, -6.25) is a minimum point of the trigonometric function.

STEP 2: PERIOD CALCULATION
- The period of the function is twice the distance between the midline point and the minimum point.
- The horizontal distance between the midline point (1.25, -2.75) and the minimum point (4.75, -6.25) is 4.75 - 1.25 = 3.5.
- Therefore, the period of the function is 2 * 3.5 = 7.

STEP 3: PREDICATE GENERATION
- Define the points A = (1.25, -2.75) and B = (4.75, -6.25).

PREDICATES:
Point(A)
Point(B)
Equals(A,(1.25,-2.75))
Equals(B,(4.75,-6.25))
