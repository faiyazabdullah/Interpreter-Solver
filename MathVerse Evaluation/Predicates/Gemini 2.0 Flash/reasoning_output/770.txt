PROBLEM 770 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, the seven small circles, which have equal radii, and the large circle share only those points on the circles that are marked. Point P is the center of the large circle and PA and PB are radii. The area of the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Circles (7 small circles, 1 large circle), Shaded sectors
- Points: A, B, P and intersection points of the circles
- Lines: PA, PB, radii of large circle and small circles
- Measurements: None given numerically
- Special markings: Equal radii markings for small circles
- Implied constructions: Radii, diameters

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center of large circle: P
- Points on large circle: A, B and other intersection points with small circles
- Center of small circles: intersection points where small circles touch
- Radii: PA, PB are radii of large circle; radii of small circles are equal
- The small circles are tangent to each other and to the large circle

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle APB appears to be a right angle, but it is not explicitly marked
- The line connecting center of small circle that lies on line PA and point P appears to be a radius of the large circle, hence, a straight line

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All seven small circles are congruent (equal radii)
- PA = PB (radii of the large circle)

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Small circles intersect each other at distinct points
- Small circles are tangent to the large circle

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The centers of the inner six circles form a hexagon
- PA and PB are radii of the large circle
- The radius of the large circle is three times the radius of the small circles.
- The shaded region consists of two sectors with radius of a small circle and central angle is 90 degrees.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates must define all objects and relationships so that area relationships can be derived.
