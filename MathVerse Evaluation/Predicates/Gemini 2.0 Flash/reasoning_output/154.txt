PROBLEM 154 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB is a long ladder leaning on the wall, the foot of the ladder B is away from the wall 1.6, the point D on the ladder is away from the wall 1.4, the length of BD is 0.55, then the length of the ladder is ()

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: The image contains lines, right angles, and implied triangles.
- Points: A, B, C, D, E.
- Lines: AB, BC, DE, AE, AC.
- Measurements: BD = 0.55, DE = 1.4, BC = 1.6.
- Special markings: Right angle at C (Angle(BCA)), right angle at E (Angle(DEA)).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BCA is a right angle. Line AC is perpendicular to line BC.
- Angle DEA is a right angle. Line AE is perpendicular to line DE.
- Angle ABC and Angle ADE are corresponding angles.
- Angle BAC and Angle DAE are corresponding angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Triangles ABC and ADE are similar.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line DE intersects line AC at point E.
- Line AB intersects line BC at point B.
- Line AB intersects line AE at point A.
- Line BC intersects line AC at point C.
- Line AB intersects line DE at point D.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC and ADE are similar right triangles. The ratio of their corresponding sides is equal.
- Since triangles are similar, Angle ABC = Angle ADE and Angle BAC = Angle DAE.
- AC = AE + EC, BC = DE + (BC-DE) if DE is parallel to BC.
- EC can be considered as the height of a rectangle, where DE and BC form its horizontal sides.
- Since DE and BC are perpendicular to EC, they are parallel to each other.
- Similarity implies AB/AD = BC/DE = AC/AE

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the information from the image is captured.
- The similarity between the triangles is identified.
- All measurements and special markings are noted.
