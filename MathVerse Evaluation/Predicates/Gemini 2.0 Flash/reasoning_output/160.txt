PROBLEM 160 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, it is known that in Rttriangle ABC, angle C = 90.0, AB = 10.0, AC = 8.0, then the value of tanB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC with angle C being 90 degrees.
- The side AB has a length of 10.0.
- The side AC has a length of 8.0.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle C is a right angle, therefore AC is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal shapes are indicated.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle. The Pythagorean theorem can be applied.
- The length of BC can be calculated.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information seems sufficient. All necessary data is present.
