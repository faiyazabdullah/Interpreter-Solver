PROBLEM 371 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 60Â°, the marked right angled side has a length of 11, and the diagonal side has a length of w. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown w.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle.
- One angle is marked as 60 degrees.
- One side is marked with length 11.
- The hypotenuse is labeled with length w.
- There is a right angle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle has a right angle.
- One angle is 60 degrees.
- Therefore, the remaining angle must be 30 degrees.
- The side with length 11 is opposite the 60-degree angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit congruence markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect to form a triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle.
- We can use trigonometric ratios or the properties of 30-60-90 triangles to relate the side lengths and angles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should allow us to relate the given side length and angle to the unknown hypotenuse w.
