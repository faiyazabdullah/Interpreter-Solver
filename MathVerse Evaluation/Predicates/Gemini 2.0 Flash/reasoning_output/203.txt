PROBLEM 203 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There are four rays with four different included angles. Find the value of x in the diagram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle and some exterior angles.
- The angles are labeled as 79°, (x - 1)°, (x + 10)°, and 2x°.
- We need to find the value of x. The exterior angles are supplementary to their adjacent interior angles.
- Let the interior angles of the triangle be A, B, and C.
- A + (x-1) = 180, so A = 181 - x.
- B + 79 = 180, so B = 101.
- C + 2x = 180, so C = 180 - 2x.
- Also, A + B + C = 180.
- (181 - x) + 101 + (180 - 2x) = 180
- 462 - 3x = 180
- 3x = 282
- x = 94

STEP 2: ANGLE ANALYSIS
- We know the exterior angle at one vertex is (x-1)°. The adjacent interior angle is 180 - (x-1) = 181 - x.
- We know the exterior angle at another vertex is 79°. The adjacent interior angle is 180 - 79 = 101.
- We know the exterior angle at the third vertex is 2x°. The adjacent interior angle is 180 - 2x.
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180°. Therefore, (181 - x) + 101 + (180 - 2x) = 180.
- Solving for x: 462 - 3x = 180 => 3x = 282 => x = 94.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We have the relationships between the exterior angles and the interior angles of a triangle. We also know that the sum of interior angles is 180 degrees. These relationships allow us to set up an equation and solve for x.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have gathered all the necessary information to form our geometric predicates needed to solve for x.
