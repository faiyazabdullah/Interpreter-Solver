PROBLEM 330 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A rally car starts at point P and races 191 kilometres south to point Q. Here the car turns west and races for 83 kilometres to point R. At point R the car must turn to head directly back to point P.

What is the compass bearing of R from P? Give your answer to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Points (P, Q, R), Lines (PQ, QR, RP), Triangle (PQR), Angle (alpha), Right Angle (PQR)
- Measurements: PQ = 191 km, QR = 83 km
- Special markings: Right angle symbol at angle PQR

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle PQR is a right angle.
- Angle alpha is formed at vertex R.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruence or equality markings are given.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines PQ and QR intersect at point Q.
- Lines RP and QR intersect at point R.
- Lines RP and QP intersect at point P.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle PQR is a right-angled triangle.
- PQ and QR are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary points, lines, and measurements are identified.
- Right angle is correctly identified.
- All needed relationships have been represented.
