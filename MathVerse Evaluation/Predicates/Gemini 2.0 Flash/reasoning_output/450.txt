PROBLEM 450 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line passes (0,5) and (2.5,0). Find the equation of the line.
Use exact numbers.
y = _ x + _
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a line in a coordinate plane.
- The line passes through the points (0, 5) and (2.5, 0).
- The x and y axes are visible.

STEP 2: LINE EQUATION
The line passes through (0,5) and (2.5,0).
The slope of the line is (0-5) / (2.5-0) = -5 / 2.5 = -2.
The y-intercept is 5.
So, the equation of the line is y = -2x + 5.

STEP 3: FINAL ANSWER
y = -2 x + 5
