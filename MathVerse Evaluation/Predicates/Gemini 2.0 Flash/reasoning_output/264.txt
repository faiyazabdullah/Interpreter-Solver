PROBLEM 264 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Parallelogram M N P Q with m \angle M = 10 x and m \angle N = 20 x, \angle M = \angle P and \angle N = \angle Q. Find \angle M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Parallelogram
- Points: M, N, P, Q
- Lines: MN, NP, PQ, QM
- Angles: Angle M, Angle N, Angle P, Angle Q
- Measurements: m \angle M = 10x, m \angle N = 20x
- Special markings: Angle N = Angle Q, Angle M = Angle P

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angles M and N are supplementary (since MN and PQ are parallel, and MQ is a transversal).
- Angles M and P are equal.
- Angles N and Q are equal.
- Angles Q and P are supplementary (since QP and MN are parallel, and NP is a transversal).

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Angle M = Angle P
- Angle N = Angle Q

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- MN intersects MQ at M, NP intersects MN at N, PQ intersects NP at P, QM intersects PQ at Q.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Parallelogram properties: opposite angles are equal, consecutive angles are supplementary.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information needed to solve the problem has been captured.
