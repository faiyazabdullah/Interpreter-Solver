PROBLEM 442 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(\frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\tan a$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a circle, x and y axes, a point labeled P, and line segments connecting the origin to point P and the origin to a point on the x-axis.
- The coordinates of point P are given as (3/5, 4/5).
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.
- The radius of the circle is 1.
- An angle $a$ is marked between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to point P.
- The origin of the coordinate system is the center of the circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The circle has center at the origin (0,0) and radius 1.
- Point P lies on the circle.
- The line segment from the origin to P is a radius.
- The point on the x-axis where the circle intersects is (1,0).

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle $a$ is in standard position.
- The x and y axes are perpendicular, forming a 90-degree angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The distance from the origin to P is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 1.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes intersect at the origin (0,0), which is also the center of the circle.
- Point P has coordinates (3/5, 4/5).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since point P lies on the circle, its coordinates satisfy the equation of the circle, x^2 + y^2 = r^2, where r = 1.  (3/5)^2 + (4/5)^2 = 9/25 + 16/25 = 25/25 = 1.
- The angle $a$ is in standard position, so its tangent is given by tan(a) = y/x = (4/5)/(3/5) = 4/3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The provided coordinates of point P are correct, which are (3/5, 4/5). The circle's radius is 1.
- All relationships and constraints needed to determine tan(a) are represented.
