PROBLEM 413 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The area $A$ of the sector below is 140.28 (cm)^2. We wish to find the length of the radius, then the perimeter.

Find the length of the radius, $r$. (You may let \theta  represent the angle of the sector). Give your answer correct to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sector of a circle and a triangle.
- There's a curved arc and two straight lines forming the sector.
- The straight lines of the sector are also sides of the triangle.
- Two sides of the triangle are marked with tick marks, indicating they are of equal length.
- One angle of the triangle is given as 27 degrees.
- The area of the sector is given as 140.28 (cm)^2.
- Let the center of the circle be denoted by $O$, and the endpoints of the arc by $A$ and $B$. The triangle is $OAB$.
- $OA$ and $OB$ are radii of the circle and sides of the triangle $OAB$.
- The lengths of $OA$ and $OB$ are equal. Let this length be $r$.
- The angle $AOB$ is $\theta$.
- The area of the sector is $A = (1/2)r^2 \theta$.
- Angle $OAB$ = Angle $OBA$. The sum of the angles in triangle $OAB$ is 180 degrees.
- Therefore, Angle $OAB$ + Angle $OBA$ + Angle $AOB$ = 180 degrees.
- 2*Angle $OAB$ + 27 degrees = 180 degrees.
- Angle $OAB$ = (180 - 27)/2 = 153/2 = 76.5 degrees.
- The angle of the sector is 27 degrees. Converting it to radians:
- 27 * (pi/180) = 3pi/20
- Area = 140.28 = (1/2) * r^2 * (3pi/20)
- r^2 = 140.28 * 2 * 20 / (3 * pi) = 5611.2 / (3 * pi) = 594.95
- r = sqrt(594.95) = 24.39

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The center of the circle is at the vertex where the 27-degree angle is located.
- The two sides of the sector are radii of the circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle at the vertex is given as 27 degrees.
- The triangle is isosceles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Two sides of the triangle are equal in length.
- Two angles in the triangle are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two radii intersect at the vertex.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the sector and the angle are related.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All relevant information has been captured.
