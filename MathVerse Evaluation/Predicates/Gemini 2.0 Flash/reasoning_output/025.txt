PROBLEM 025 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, EF parallel BC, AC bisects angle BAF, angle B = 50.0, then the degree of angle C is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC and a line EF.
- Points: A, B, C, E, F.
- Lines: EF, BC, AB, AC.
- Angle B is given as 50 degrees.
- EF is parallel to BC.
- AC bisects angle BAF.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle B = 50.
- EF || BC.
- Angle BAF is bisected by AC.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent triangles or shapes are explicitly indicated.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- EF intersects AB at A and AC at A.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Because EF || BC, angle BAF + angle B = 180 degrees (same-side interior angles).
- Since AC bisects angle BAF, angle BAC = angle CAF.
- We can use these relationships to determine angle C.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the necessary information to solve for angle C.
