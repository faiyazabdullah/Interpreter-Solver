PROBLEM 743 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions, splitted by a middle base. Length of middle base is 8, height of upper square pyramid is 2x+3, height of whole square pyramid is 6x+9.

Find an expression for the length L of the base of the pyramid in terms of the variable, x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes (circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.)
The image shows a truncated square pyramid and a square pyramid.
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names
The image shows the length of the middle base of the truncated pyramid as 8, the height of the upper square pyramid as 2x+3, and the height of the whole square pyramid as 6x+9. The base of the whole square pyramid is L.
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values
Length of middle base = 8
Height of upper square pyramid = 2x+3
Height of whole square pyramid = 6x+9
Length of base of whole pyramid = L
- Identify ALL special markings (right angle symbols, parallel marks, congruent marks, equal marks, etc.)
All pyramids are upright.
- Look for implied constructions (perpendiculars, bisectors, tangents, chords, radii, etc.)
Implied perpendicularity of the height to the base in the square pyramid.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS (If circles are present)
Not applicable.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Examine ALL angles shown in the diagram, both marked and unmarked
Right angles at the base.
- Look for right angle indicators or perpendicular relationships
- Check for angle bisectors or special angle relationships
- Identify complementary, supplementary, or vertical angles
- Look for inscribed angles and their corresponding arcs

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL equal lengths, angles, or shapes (look for tick marks, identical measurements)
- Check for congruent triangles or similar figures
- Look for equal radii in circles
- Identify parallel lines or equal distances
All the angles at the base are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Determine where lines intersect and at what points
- Check if points lie on specific lines or circles
- Identify midpoints, centroids, or other special points
- Look for points that divide segments in specific ratios

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Combine observations to identify implicit relationships
The upper pyramid is similar to the whole pyramid.
- Look for theorem applications (Pythagorean, inscribed angle, etc.)
Similar triangle theorem can be used to solve the problem
- Identify geometric constructions that create specific relationships
- Check for properties that follow from the given constraints

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured
- Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented
- Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed
- Confirm that the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving
