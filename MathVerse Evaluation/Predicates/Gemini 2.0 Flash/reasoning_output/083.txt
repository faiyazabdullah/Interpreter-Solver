PROBLEM 083 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, it is known that in circle O, the central angle angle AOB = 100.0, then the angle of circumference angle ACB is equal to ().
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Circle, triangle.
- Points: A, B, C, O.
- Lines: AB, AC, BC, OA, OB.
- Angles: Angle AOB = 100 degrees.
- Special markings: None.
- Implied constructions: OA and OB are radii.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: O.
- Points on the circle: A, B, C.
- Lines: OA and OB are radii, AB, AC and BC are chords.
- Angles: Central angle AOB, inscribed angle ACB.
- Equal radius relationships: OA = OB.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AOB is a central angle. Angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtended by the same arc AB.
- Inscribed angle theorem.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB since they are radii of the same circle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point A lies on circle O.
- Point B lies on circle O.
- Point C lies on circle O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Angle ACB is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc as the central angle AOB. The measure of angle ACB is half the measure of angle AOB.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is captured.
