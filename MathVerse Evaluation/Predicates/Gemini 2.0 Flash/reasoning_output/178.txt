PROBLEM 178 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, triangle ABC is the inscribed triangle of circle O, if angle ACB = 30.0, AB = 6.0, then the radius of circle O is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image contains a circle with center O, and an inscribed triangle ABC.
We are given that angle ACB is 30 degrees, and AB = 6.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The circle is centered at O. A, B, and C are points on the circle. AB, AC, and BC are chords of the circle.
We are asked to find the radius of the circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle ACB = 30 degrees. Since triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle, we can use the law of sines.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruent figures are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
A, B, and C lie on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Using the Law of Sines, AB / sin(ACB) = 2R, where R is the radius of the circle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We are given AB and angle ACB, which can be used to calculate the radius.
