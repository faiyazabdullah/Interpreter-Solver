PROBLEM 563 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadratic function g opens downward, and goes through (-1,-4), (-5,-4) with a vertex of (-3,0). Is the discriminant of g positive, zero, or negative?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a quadratic function, g(x).
Points on the graph are (-1, -4), (-5, -4) and (-3, 0).
The quadratic function opens downwards.
The vertex of the function is (-3, 0).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
No specific angles are marked or implied.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The points (-1, -4) and (-5, -4) have the same y-value, so they are equidistant from the axis of symmetry x = -3.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The vertex of the parabola is (-3, 0).
The parabola intersects the x-axis at x = -3.
The parabola passes through points (-1, -4) and (-5, -4).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The given points and the vertex provide information about the quadratic function. Because the quadratic function intersects the x-axis at only one point, (-3, 0), the discriminant must be zero.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The relationships and properties required for the question are captured.
