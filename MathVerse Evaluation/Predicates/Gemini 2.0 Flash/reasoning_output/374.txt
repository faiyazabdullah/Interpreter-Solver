PROBLEM 374 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 30Â°, the marked right angled side has a length of x, and the diagonal side has a length of sqrt{10}. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the exact value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right-angled triangle.
- The vertices are not labeled, but we can refer to the triangle as having vertices A, B, and C, where angle B is the right angle.
- The side opposite the 30-degree angle (AB) is not explicitly given.
- The side adjacent to the 30-degree angle (BC) is labeled as x.
- The hypotenuse (AC) is labeled as sqrt(10).
- One angle is marked as 30 degrees.
- One angle is marked as a right angle (90 degrees).

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BCA = 30 degrees.
- Angle ABC = 90 degrees.
- Therefore, Angle BAC = 180 - 90 - 30 = 60 degrees.
- The lines AB and BC are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometric relationships to relate the sides and angles.
- Specifically, cos(30) = adjacent/hypotenuse = x/sqrt(10).
- The Pythagorean theorem also applies: x^2 + AB^2 = (sqrt(10))^2.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the necessary information to solve for x using the cosine relationship.
