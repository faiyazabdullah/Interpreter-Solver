PROBLEM 221 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the triangle, there are two angles as 60 and 55 degrees. Find x. Round the side measure to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle with two angles and one side length given.
- The triangle has vertices that are not labeled. Let's label them A, B, and C, where angle A is 60 degrees, angle B is 55 degrees, and the side opposite to angle C has length 73. Let x be the side opposite to angle A.
- The angles provided are 60 degrees and 55 degrees. The side length is 73. We need to find the length of side 'x'.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable as there are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are three angles in the triangle. Two angles are given as 60 and 55 degrees. The third angle can be calculated as 180 - (60 + 55) = 65 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality is explicitly marked in the diagram.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides of the triangle intersect at the vertices A, B, and C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use the Law of Sines to find the value of x. The Law of Sines states that a/sin(A) = b/sin(B) = c/sin(C). In our case, x/sin(60) = 73/sin(65).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the necessary information to solve for 'x'. We have the angles and one side length, which allows us to use the Law of Sines.
