PROBLEM 609 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What does the average rate of change tell you?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with a line.
- The x-axis is labeled "quantity (thousand units)" and ranges from approximately 0 to 22.
- The y-axis is labeled "price" and ranges from 0 to 25.
- There are two points on the line: one at approximately (6, 17) and another at approximately (16, 22).
- The line appears to be linear, indicating a constant rate of change.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular, forming a right angle.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicitly marked congruent or equal elements are apparent.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects both the x and y axes.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The slope of the line represents the average rate of change of price with respect to quantity.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The coordinates of the two points are important to determine the slope and therefore the average rate of change.
