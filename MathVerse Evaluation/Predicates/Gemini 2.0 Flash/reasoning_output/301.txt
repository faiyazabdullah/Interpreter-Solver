PROBLEM 301 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In triangle A B C, A B = x, B C = 16. \angle B A C = 97 degrees and \angle A C B = 21 degrees. Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC.
- Point A, B, and C are vertices of the triangle.
- Side AB has length x.
- Side BC has length 16.
- Angle BAC is 97 degrees.
- Angle ACB is 21 degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BAC is 97 degrees.
- Angle ACB is 21 degrees.
- Angle ABC = 180 - 97 - 21 = 62 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent sides or angles are marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at points A, B, and C, forming the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Law of Sines can be used to find x.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information is present.
