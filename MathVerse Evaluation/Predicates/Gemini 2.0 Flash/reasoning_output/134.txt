PROBLEM 134 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the picture, Xiaoying designed a flashlight to measure the height of an ancient city wall. Place a horizontal plane mirror at point P. The light starts from point A and is reflected by the plane mirror and hits the top C of the ancient city wall CD. It is known that AB perpendicular  BD, CD perpendicular  BD. And it is measured that AB = 1.4, BP = 2.1, PD = 12.0. Then the height of the ancient city wall CD is ()

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: Triangles (AB P and CD P), Lines (AB, BP, CD, DP, AP, CP)
- Points: A, B, P, C, D
- Measurements: AB = 1.4, BP = 2.1, PD = 12.0
- Special markings: Right angle symbols at B and D, indicating perpendicularity. Light reflection path.
- Implied constructions: AB and CD are perpendicular to BD. Angle of incidence equals angle of reflection.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Right angles: Angle ABP and Angle CDP are right angles.
- Perpendicular lines: AB is perpendicular to BD, CD is perpendicular to BD.
- Angle of incidence = Angle of reflection.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Similar triangles: Triangle ABP is similar to triangle CDP.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- P lies on BD.
- A is a point above B.
- C is a point above D.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Similar triangles relationship will allow determining CD from the given ratios.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information required to calculate CD has been captured.
