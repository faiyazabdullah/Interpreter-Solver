PROBLEM 121 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The production process of paper umbrellas in our country is very ingenious. As shown in the figure, whether the umbrella is opened or closed, the handle AP always bisects the angle angle BAC formed by the two ribs in the same plane, and AE = AF, DE = DF, so as to ensure that the umbrella ring can slide along the handle. When a toy umbrella is opened, the BDC is on the same straight line. If AB = 50.0, AD = 14.0, then the area of ​​oil paper required to make such a paper umbrella is (don't remember the seam) ()

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, P
- Lines: AB, AC, AD, AP, BE, CF, DE, DF
- Shapes: Triangles ADE, ADF, ABC; Angles BAP, CAP
- Measurements: AB = 50, AD = 14, AE = AF, DE = DF
- AP bisects angle BAC
- B, D, and C are collinear

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present in the image

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- AP bisects angle BAC, so angle BAP = angle CAP
- No explicit right angles are marked, but AP is the angle bisector

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AE = AF, DE = DF
- AP bisects angle BAC, so angle BAP = angle CAP

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point D lies on line segment AP
- Points E and F lie on lines AB and AC respectively

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangles ADE and ADF are congruent by SSS (AE = AF, DE = DF, AD = AD)
- Triangles ABE and ACF share the angle at A
- AP is the angle bisector of angle BAC.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All given information is captured
- Key relationships like congruence of triangles ADE and ADF, and angle bisector property are represented.
