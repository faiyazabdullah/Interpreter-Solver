PROBLEM 241 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right triangle, the hypotenuse is 20 and two sides are y and x. Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see a right triangle.
- The vertices of the triangle are not labeled. Let's call them A, B, and C, where the right angle is at B, the 60-degree angle is at A, and the remaining angle is at C.
- The sides are x, y, and 20.
- The angle at A is 60 degrees.
- The angle at B is 90 degrees (right angle).
- The side opposite angle A is x. The side opposite angle B is 20. The side opposite angle C is y.
- The hypotenuse is 20.
- The legs are x and y.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is a right angle, so Line(A,B) is perpendicular to Line(B,C).
- Angle BAC is 60 degrees.
- Angle BCA is 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees.

STEP 3: TRIGONOMETRY
- We can use trigonometric relationships.
- cos(60) = y/20
- sin(60) = x/20

STEP 4: GEOMETRIC RELATIONSHIPS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
