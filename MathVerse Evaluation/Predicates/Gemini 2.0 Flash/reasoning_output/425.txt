PROBLEM 425 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: An industrial site in the shape of a triangle is to take up the space between where three roads intersect. The triangle has an angle of 44° and two sides of 50m and 80m.

Calculate the area of the site.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows a diagram of roads forming a triangle.
- Points: There are implicit intersection points where roads meet.
- Lines: The roads are represented as lines. Two sides of the triangle are given as 50m and 80m and the angle between those sides is 44°.
- Measurements:  Side 1 = 50m, Side 2 = 80m, Angle = 44 degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- One angle is given as 44°.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality is explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The roads intersect to form the triangle's vertices.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We have two sides and an included angle of a triangle, which allows us to calculate the area of the triangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information to set up the area calculation.
