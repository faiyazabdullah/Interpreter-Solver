PROBLEM 053 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the straight line a parallel  b, the straight line c intersects a and b, angle 1 = 55.0, then angle 2 = ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two lines, a and b, are shown.
- Line c intersects both lines a and b.
- Angle 1 is formed by the intersection of line c and line a, and is given as 55 degrees.
- Angle 2 is formed by the intersection of line c and line b.
- Line a is parallel to line b.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 and the adjacent angle to angle 1 are supplementary.
- Angle 2 and the angle vertically opposite to angle 2 are equal.
- Since lines a and b are parallel, the corresponding angles are equal. Therefore the angle adjacent to angle 1 and angle 2 are supplementary.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line c intersects line a and line b.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since line a is parallel to line b, angle 1 and angle 2 are corresponding angles.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information includes two parallel lines cut by a transversal.
