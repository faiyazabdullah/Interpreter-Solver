PROBLEM 517 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the graphs of the functions $y=4^{x}$ and $y=\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{x}$. How would you describe the rate of increase of $y=4^{x}$ ?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two graphs are shown.
- The left graph represents the function y = 4^x.
- The right graph represents the function y = (1/4)^x.
- Both graphs are displayed on a Cartesian coordinate system with x and y axes.
- The x-axis ranges from approximately -5 to 5.
- The y-axis ranges from approximately -5 to 5.
- The graph of y = 4^x is an increasing exponential function.
- The graph of y = (1/4)^x is a decreasing exponential function.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The scales on the x and y axes appear to be equal.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Both graphs intersect the y-axis at y=1.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph of y = (1/4)^x is the reflection of y = 4^x across the y-axis.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The graphs and their equations are captured.
