PROBLEM 735 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As the solid shown in the figure, the seven marked edges have the same length. The height of the prism of 16 cm. Find the volume of the composite solid shown.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure is a composite solid made of rectangular prisms.
- The height of the bottom prism is given as 7 cm.
- The length of the bottom prism is given as 16 cm.
- Seven edges are marked with the same length. Let's denote this length as 'x'.
- Since the figure is composed of rectangular prisms, we can assume that many angles are right angles.
- The composite solid can be viewed as a large prism with two smaller prisms on top.
- From the marking, we know that the height of the top prisms is equal to the height of the bottom prisms, so x = 7cm.
- Also from the marking, the length of the shorter part in bottom prism is equal to 7cm.
- The remaining length of the bottom prim is 16-7=9cm.
- Therefore, the length of the top prism is 9cm.
- The width of each top prism is 7cm, the same as the height.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- All faces of the rectangular prisms are perpendicular to each other. Therefore, edges meeting at the vertices of the prisms form right angles.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The seven marked edges are congruent.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The top prisms are positioned on top of the bottom prism.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The figure is composed of rectangular prisms. The dimensions are related through the equal-length edges.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to identify all the shapes and the relationship to determine the volume. The crucial relationship is the length of the equal edges.
