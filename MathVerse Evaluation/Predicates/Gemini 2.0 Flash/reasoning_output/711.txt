PROBLEM 711 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The top of a solid cone was sawed off to form the solid attached. The top cone has a diameter of 8cm and slant height of 8cm. The solid cone has a diameter of 4cm. The solid left has a slant height of 8cm. Find the surface area of the solid formed, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Circles (top and bottom), frustum of a cone
- Points: Centers of the circles (unlabeled), vertices of the cone (unlabeled)
- Lines: Slant heights of the frustum (labeled 8cm), diameters of the circles (2cm and 4cm)
- Measurements: Diameter of top circle (2cm), diameter of bottom circle (4cm), slant height of frustum (8cm), and slant height of the removed cone (8cm)
- No right angle symbols, parallel marks, or congruent marks are explicitly shown.
- Implied: The diagram represents a frustum of a cone, created by removing a smaller cone from a larger one.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Top circle: Diameter 2cm, thus radius 1cm.
- Bottom circle: Diameter 4cm, thus radius 2cm.
- No tangents or inscribed angles are readily apparent.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit angles are marked.
- Implied perpendicularity between the radii and the height of the frustum/cones.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two slant heights of the solid are equal.
- The relationship between the frustum and the two cones.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The top cone is removed, resulting into the frustum.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The frustum is formed by removing a cone from a larger cone.
- The diameters are given, which can be used to calculate radii and areas.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should represent the shapes, measurements, and relationships in the diagram to allow for surface area calculation.
