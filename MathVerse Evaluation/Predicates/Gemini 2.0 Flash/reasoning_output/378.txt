PROBLEM 378 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, the hypotenuse measures 8\sqrt{5}. Consider the adjacent figure:Find the exact value of y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see a right-angled triangle.
- The vertices are not labeled, so let's denote them as A, B, and C, where angle B is the right angle.
- One of the acute angles, angle A, is given as 60 degrees.
- The hypotenuse AC is given as 8âˆš5.
- The side opposite to angle A, which is side BC, is labeled as x.
- The side adjacent to angle A, which is side AB, is labeled as y.
- There is a right angle symbol at vertex B.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle A is 60 degrees.
- Angle B is 90 degrees.
- Therefore, angle C = 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees.
- AB is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent triangles are present.
- No parallel lines.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and BC intersect at B.
- Lines AC and BC intersect at C.
- Lines AC and AB intersect at A.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometric ratios to find the sides x and y.
- The Pythagorean theorem can be applied.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given angle and hypotenuse, combined with the right angle, allows the calculation of the lengths of the other sides.
