PROBLEM 108 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Shaoxing is a famous bridge township. As shown in the figure, the distance CD from the top of the round arch bridge to the water surface is 8.0, and the arch radius OC is 5.0, so the width of the water surface AB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle, lines, and points labeled A, B, C, D, and O.
- There's a circle with center O.
- Line segment AB is a chord of the circle.
- Line segment CD is perpendicular to line segment AB.
- Point D lies on line segment AB.
- CD has a length of 8.
- The radius OC has a length of 5.
- We're given the distance OD is equal to CD - OC which is equal to 8-5 = 3.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Point O is the center of the circle.
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.
- OC is a radius.
- AB is a chord.
- Since CD is perpendicular to AB, CD bisects AB.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ODA is a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA and OB and OC are equal in length because they are all radii.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line segment CD intersects line segment AB at point D.
- Point D is on circle, but not indicated so.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since CD is perpendicular to the chord AB, CD bisects AB.
- Triangle ODA is a right triangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the length of AB, the width of the water surface.
