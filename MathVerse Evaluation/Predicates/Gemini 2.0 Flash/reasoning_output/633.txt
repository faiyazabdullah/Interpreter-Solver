PROBLEM 633 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of $y=\sin x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(90^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=5 \sin x$
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a graph of a sine function.
- The x-axis represents angles in degrees from 0 to 360.
- The y-axis ranges from -1 to 1.
- The function passes through points (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0).
- A point is marked on the function at (90,1).
- The axes are labeled as x and y.
- There are gridlines at x=90, x=180, x=270, x=360 and y=-1, y=1.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.
- Angles are measured along the x-axis in degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The maximum value of the function is 1 and the minimum value is -1.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sine function intersects the x-axis at 0, 180, and 360 degrees.
- The sine function intersects the y-axis at 0.
- The marked point is located at (90,1).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph represents the function y = sin(x).
- The point (90, 1) is a maximum point of the sine function.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All important features of the graph have been captured in the analysis.
- The maximum point and the values on axes are captured.
