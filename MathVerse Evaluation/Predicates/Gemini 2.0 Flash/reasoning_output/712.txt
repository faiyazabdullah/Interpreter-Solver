PROBLEM 712 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the pyramid. The perpendicular height is 8mm. The base is a square with the edge of 10mm. Include all faces in your calculations.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a square pyramid.
- The base is a square with sides of 10mm.
- The perpendicular height of the pyramid is 8mm.
- The diagram shows a right angle between the perpendicular height and the base.
- The diagram shows the lengths of the sides of the square base.
- The diagram shows the perpendicular height of the pyramid.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The diagram contains a right angle where the perpendicular height meets the center of the square base.
- The faces of the pyramid are isosceles triangles.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All sides of the square base are equal in length (10mm).
- The four triangular faces of the pyramid are congruent isosceles triangles.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The apex of the pyramid is positioned directly above the center of the square base.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height and the side of the base are given. We need to find the surface area of the pyramid.
- Surface area of pyramid = Base area + Lateral area
- Base area = side * side
- Lateral area = 4 * (1/2 * base * slant height)
- slant height = sqrt(height^2 + (side/2)^2)
- slant height = sqrt(8^2 + 5^2)
- slant height = sqrt(64 + 25)
- slant height = sqrt(89)

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The lengths of the sides of the base, and the perpendicular height are known.
- These measurements are sufficient to calculate the surface area of the pyramid.
