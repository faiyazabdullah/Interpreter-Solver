PROBLEM 515 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows the amount of water remaining in a bucket that was initially full before a hole was made in its side. What is the slope of the shown function that passes (0, 30)?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a line on a coordinate plane.
- The x-axis is labeled "time (minutes)" and represents the independent variable.
- The y-axis is labeled "quantity (litres)" and represents the dependent variable.
- The line passes through (0, 30) approximately.
- The line passes through (44, 8) approximately.
- The scales on the axes are such that each grid line represents 4 units.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The line slopes downwards. This indicates that the amount of water is decreasing with time.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly congruent or equal parts.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the y-axis at approximately 30.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The slope of the line can be determined from the graph.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The coordinates of two points on the line are (0, 30) and (44, 8).
- We can calculate the slope of the line using these two points.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The problem asks for the slope of the function.
- The slope can be calculated by (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
- The slope is (8 - 30) / (44 - 0) = -22 / 44 = -1/2
