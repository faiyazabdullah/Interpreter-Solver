PROBLEM 361 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A safety fence is constructed to protect tourists from the danger of an eroding castle toppling down. At point A, the surveyor takes an angle measurement to the top of the tower of 10°. She then walks 29 meters towards the tower and takes another reading of 22° at point B.
Hence or otherwise, find the value of h to the nearest metre.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: The image contains two people represented as points, a brick structure, a tower, lines of sight forming triangles.
- Points: A, B, and an implied point C at the base of the tower, and a point at the top of the tower.
- Lines: Lines of sight from the people to the top of the tower, horizontal lines along the ground.
- Measurements: Distance between the two people is 29 m, angles of elevation 10° and 22°. The height of the tower is 'h'.
- Markings: Angles are marked.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Two angles of elevation are given: 10° and 22°. There's an implicit right angle at the base of the tower.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicitly congruent triangles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines of sight intersect at the top of the tower.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The distance between the two points is 29 m. The height of the tower is 'h'.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is captured.
