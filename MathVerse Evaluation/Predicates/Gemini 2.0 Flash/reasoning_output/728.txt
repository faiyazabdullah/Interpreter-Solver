PROBLEM 728 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Each side length of the cube is equal to 12cm. Find the volume of the cube shown.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cube.
- The side length of the cube is labeled as 12 cm.
- All sides of a cube are equal in length.
- All angles in a cube are right angles.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as there are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- All angles formed by the edges of the cube are right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All sides of the cube are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The edges of the cube intersect at the vertices.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- A cube is a rectangular prism where all sides are equal.
- The volume of a cube is side * side * side = side^3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The side length is provided, allowing us to calculate the volume.
- All relevant geometric properties of the cube are identified.
