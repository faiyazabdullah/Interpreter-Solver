PROBLEM 302 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two triangles G J I and G K H are similar with a shared vertex G. K H and J I are parallel. Find K J if G J = 8, G H = 12, and H I = 4.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image contains two triangles, GJI and GKH.
- Points: Points G, J, I, K, H are labeled.
- Lines: Lines GJ, JI, GI, GK, KH, GH are present.
- Measurements: GJ = 8, GH = 12, HI = 4.
- Special markings: KH is parallel to JI, indicated by arrows.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No right angles are explicitly marked.
- Since KH is parallel to JI, Angle(G,K,H) = Angle(G,J,I) and Angle(G,H,K) = Angle(G,I,J) (corresponding angles).
- Angle G is common to both triangles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Triangle GKH is similar to triangle GJI because their corresponding angles are equal (AA similarity).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable in this case.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- KH is parallel to JI. Therefore, GKH and GJI are similar triangles.
- Using similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All given information is captured.
- The similarity of the triangles and parallel lines are represented.
