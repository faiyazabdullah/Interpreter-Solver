PROBLEM 676 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The solid shown is constructed by cutting out a quarter of a sphere from a cube. Find its surface area if the side length is 14.2 and the radius is half that.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Cube with a quarter of a sphere removed.
- Measurements: Side length of the cube is 14.2 cm, radius of the sphere is 7.1 cm.
- The radius is implied to be half of the side length.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The sphere is cut into a quarter.
- The radius of the sphere is 7.1cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The cube has right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All sides of the cube are equal in length before the cutout.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sphere is positioned at a corner of the cube.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The radius of the sphere is half the side length of the cube.
- The cutout creates curved surfaces.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information is sufficient to calculate the surface area of the solid.

PREDICATES:

Shape(sphere)
LengthOf(side)=14.2
LengthOf(radius)=7.1
Div(LengthOf(side),2)=LengthOf(radius)
