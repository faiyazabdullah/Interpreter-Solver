PROBLEM 657 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the given cylinder. The height is 80 and radius is 98. All measurements in the diagram are in mm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shape: The image depicts a cylinder.
- Measurements: The height of the cylinder is 80. The diameter of the circular base is 98.
- Goal: Find the surface area of the cylinder.

STEP 2: CYLINDER ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circular base is half the diameter, so radius = 98/2 = 49.
- The height of the cylinder is 80.
- The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula 2πr^2 + 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height.

STEP 3: SURFACE AREA CALCULATION
- Surface Area = 2π(49)^2 + 2π(49)(80)
- Surface Area = 2π(2401) + 2π(3920)
- Surface Area = 4802π + 7840π
- Surface Area = 12642π
- Surface Area ≈ 39713.24

STEP 4: FINAL ANSWER
- Surface Area ≈ 39713.24 mm^2
