PROBLEM 457 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the circle on the graph. Its center is at (1,3) and its radius is 6.

Find the equation of the circle in standard form.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Circle, x and y axes, point at the center of the circle.
- Points: Center of the circle at (1,3). Points on the circle.
- Lines: x-axis and y-axis.
- Measurements: Radius = 6. Center coordinates (1,3).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center of the circle: (1,3)
- Radius of the circle: 6
- Points on the circle satisfy the equation (x-1)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 6^2

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All radii of the circle are equal to 6.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The circle's center is at (1,3).
- The circle intersects the x-axis and y-axis.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The standard equation of a circle is (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2, where (h,k) is the center and r is the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the center (1,3) and radius 6.
