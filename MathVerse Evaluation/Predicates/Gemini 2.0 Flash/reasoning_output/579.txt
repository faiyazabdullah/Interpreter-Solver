PROBLEM 579 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

Which of the following could model the percentage that Lucy can still recall after $t$ days?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two curves representing recall percentage over time.
- There are x and y axes, labeled "days" and "recall percentage" respectively.
- The y-axis ranges from 0 to 100 (implied).
- There are two curves, one gray and one black. Both curves start at 100 on the y-axis.
- The curves represent the percentage of content recalled over time.
- The gray curve represents Maximilian's recall, and the black curve represents Lucy's recall.
- Both curves are decreasing, indicating memory loss over time. The rate of decrease appears to be slowing down over time.
- The graph is contained within a box

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Both curves start at the same y-value of 100.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Both curves intersect the y-axis at 100.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The curves represent exponential decay models, starting at 100% recall.
- Maximilian's recall percentage is represented by the gray curve, and Lucy's by the black curve.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The geometric information provided captures the graph and the relationships between the curves.
