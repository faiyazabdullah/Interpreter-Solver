PROBLEM 052 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, put the two vertices of a right triangle plate with 45.0 angles on the opposite edges of the ruler. If angle 1 = 27.5, then angle 2 is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a rectangle ABCD.
- We have a triangle with vertices labeled F, C, and E. One angle is 45 degrees, which means the triangle is a 45-45-90 right triangle.
- The triangle is placed on the rectangle such that C lies on CD and E lies on AB.
- Angle 1 is labeled as 27.5 degrees.
- Angle 2 is unlabeled but is an angle within the triangle.
- AB is parallel to CD.
- AD is parallel to BC.
- The triangle FCE is a right triangle with Angle(CFE) = 90, Angle(FCE) = Angle(FEC) = 45.
- Since AB || CD, angle BCE + angle CEB = 180. Since angle 1 + angle BCE = 180, angle 1 = angle CEB

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 = 27.5 degrees
- Angle FCE = Angle FEC = 45 degrees, Angle CFE = 90 degrees.
- AB is parallel to CD.
- Angle ECB + angle 1 = 180, since the two lines AB and CD are parallel. But we don't know ECB to use this.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle FCE is an isosceles right triangle.
- Angle FEC = angle FCE.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point C lies on CD.
- Point E lies on AB.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB || CD, Angle BCE + Angle CEB = 180 degrees.
- Angle CEB can be split into angle 2 and angle FEC. Therefore, Angle CEB = Angle 2 + 45.
- Angle BCE can be written as 180-27.5 which comes from angle 1 + angle BCE = 180.
- Therefore we can write 180-27.5 + angle 2 + 45 = 180.
- angle 2 = 27.5 - 45

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The goal is to find the measurement of Angle 2. The above information should suffice for another system to solve it.
