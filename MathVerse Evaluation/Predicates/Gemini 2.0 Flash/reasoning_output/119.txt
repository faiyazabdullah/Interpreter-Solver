PROBLEM 119 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, use a sector cardboard with a radius of 24.0 to make a conical hat (the seams are ignored). If the radius of the bottom surface of the conical hat is 10.0, then the area of ​​this sector cardboard is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: sector, circle, cone
- Points: O (center of the circle which is the base of the cone)
- Lines: There is an implied line connecting the vertex of the cone to a point on the circumference of the base of the cone.
- Measurements: Radius of sector = 24, Radius of cone's base = 10
- The sector is used to form the curved surface of the cone. The radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the cone's base.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle that forms the base of the cone is 10.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are explicitly given.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the sector is equal to the slant height of the cone.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The arc length of the sector equals the circumference of the circle that forms the base of the cone.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the sector is needed to solve the problem.
- The arc length of the sector is equal to $2\pi * 10 = 20\pi$
- Let $\theta$ be the central angle of the sector. The arc length is also given by $24\theta$, so $24\theta = 20\pi$, and $\theta = \frac{20\pi}{24} = \frac{5\pi}{6}$.
- The area of the sector is $\frac{1}{2}r^2\theta = \frac{1}{2} * 24^2 * \frac{5\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{2} * 576 * \frac{5\pi}{6} = 48*5*\pi = 240\pi$
-  Alternatively, since arc length is $20\pi$ and radius is 24, the area is $\frac{1}{2}*20\pi*24 = 240\pi$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The goal is to find the area of the sector.
