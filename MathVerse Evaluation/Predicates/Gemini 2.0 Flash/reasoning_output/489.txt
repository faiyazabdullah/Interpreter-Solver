PROBLEM 489 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There are two curves with a vertical asymptote x=3. One curve passes (1,0), and another curve passes (4,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two curves with a vertical asymptote at x=3.
- One curve passes through (1, 0) and the other passes through (4, 0).
- The curves extend towards negative infinity near the asymptote.
- The curves decrease from x=-2 to x=1 and then increase towards x=3 from the left
- The curves decrease from x=3 to x=4 and then increase to x=6.

STEP 2: INTERVAL ANALYSIS
The graph is decreasing on (-inf, 1) and (3,4).
The graph is increasing on (1,3) and (4, inf).
