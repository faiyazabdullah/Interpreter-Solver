PROBLEM 199 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Circle O has a radius of 13 inches, which is the length of O C. Radius O B is perpendicular at point X to chord C D which is 24 inches long. Find O X.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a circle with center O.
- Points C, B, and D lie on the circle.
- Line segment CD is a chord of the circle.
- Line segment OB is a radius of the circle.
- Line segment OC is a radius of the circle.
- Line segment OB is perpendicular to CD at point X.
- The length of OC is 13.
- The length of CX is 12 and XD is 12 since OX is perpendicular to CD.
- The length of CD is 24.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- O is the center of the circle.
- C, B, and D lie on the circle.
- OC and OB are radii. Thus LengthOf(OC) = LengthOf(OB) = 13.
- CD is a chord.
- Since OB is perpendicular to CD at X, X is the midpoint of CD.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle OXC is a right angle.
- OB is perpendicular to CD.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- LengthOf(OC) = LengthOf(OB) because they are radii of the same circle.
- CX = XD since OX is perpendicular to CD.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- OB and CD intersect at X.
- C,X, and D are collinear.
- O, X, and B are collinear.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle OXC is a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find OX.
- LengthOf(CD) = 24, and since X is the midpoint of CD, then LengthOf(CX) = 12.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information necessary to find OX. OC = 13, CX = 12, and angle OXC is a right angle.
