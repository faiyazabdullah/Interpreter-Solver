PROBLEM 336 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the north direction is 31Â°.

Find the true bearing of point A from O.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Point, Line, Angle
- Points: A, O
- Lines: OA, North direction line, East-West line
- Angles: Angle between OA and the north direction
- Measurements: 31 degrees
- Special markings: North direction marker (N), East-West direction markers
- Implied constructions: Compass directions

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles in the image

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle between OA and the north direction is marked as 31 degrees.
- The North direction is perpendicular to the East-West direction.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruencies marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at point O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.
- Angle between north direction and line OA is given.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information needed to define the geometry is captured.
- Key relationships for the solution are represented.
