PROBLEM 719 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the two similar spheres shown. The smaller sphere has radius 3 cm while the larger sphere has a radius of 12 cm.
What is the ratio of the volume of Sphere A to Sphere B?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There are two shapes, A and B, which are identified as spheres.
- Sphere A has a diameter indicated by a line segment of length 3.
- Sphere B has a diameter indicated by a line segment of length 12.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Both spheres appear to be circles in 2D representation.
- The line segments of length 3 and 12 represent diameters of the respective circles.
- The radii are therefore 1.5 and 6.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles or perpendicularity are explicitly marked or easily inferred from the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The spheres are similar but not congruent.
- The lengths of the diameter lines are given as 3 and 12.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line segments of lengths 3 and 12 pass through the center of the respective circles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The diameters of the two spheres are 3 and 12.
- The radius of sphere A is half of its diameter (3/2 = 1.5).
- The radius of sphere B is half of its diameter (12/2 = 6).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information provided includes the diameters, from which the radii can be derived. This is sufficient to calculate the ratio of the volumes.
