PROBLEM 222 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For the pair of similar figures in blue and green, use the given areas to find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two rectangles are shown, one blue and one green.
- The blue rectangle has a width of 4 in and an area of 8 sq in.
- The green rectangle has a width of x in and an area of 32 sq in.
- The area of a rectangle is length * width.
- Both figures are rectangles, implying all angles are right angles.
- The figures are similar.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- All angles in the rectangles are right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangles are similar but not congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- No intersections are shown or needed.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Area of rectangle = length * width
- The ratio of corresponding sides in similar figures is constant.
- We can find the length of the blue rectangle by dividing the area by the width: 8 / 4 = 2 in.
- Let the length of the green rectangle be y. Then, its length times its width is its area, so y * x = 32.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to capture the properties of rectangles, areas, and similarity.
