PROBLEM 370 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right angled triangle, a marked right angled line has a length of 4 and a slanted line has a length of 4*sqrt{2}. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown \theta . Leave your answer in degrees.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right-angled triangle.
- The vertices are not labelled. Let's label the vertices of the triangle as A, B, and C, where angle B is the right angle.
- The side AB has a length of 4.
- The side AC (hypotenuse) has a length of 4*sqrt(2).
- Angle ACB is labelled as theta.
- There is a right angle marker at vertex B.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is a right angle.
- We are given the angle ACB as theta.
- We can find the angle BAC as 90 - theta.
- Line AB is perpendicular to Line BC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- We are given that the length of side AB is 4 and the length of side AC is 4*sqrt(2).
- We can calculate the length of side BC using the Pythagorean theorem. BC = sqrt((4*sqrt(2))^2 - 4^2) = sqrt(32 - 16) = sqrt(16) = 4.
- Since AB = BC = 4, the triangle is an isosceles right triangle. Therefore, angle ACB (theta) must be 45 degrees.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines AB and BC intersect at point B.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The Pythagorean theorem applies to this right triangle: AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2.
- Since AB = BC = 4, the triangle is an isosceles right triangle, and the angles opposite the equal sides are also equal.
- Therefore, angle ACB = angle BAC. Since angle ABC = 90 degrees, angle ACB + angle BAC = 90 degrees. So, 2 * angle ACB = 90 degrees, which means angle ACB = 45 degrees.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates must describe all elements and relationships needed to solve the problem but should not give the solution.
- We have all necessary information to define the sides and angles.
