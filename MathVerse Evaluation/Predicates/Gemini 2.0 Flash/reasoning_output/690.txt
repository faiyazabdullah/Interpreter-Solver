PROBLEM 690 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the halfpipe with a diameter of 8 cm.

Find its volume, rounding to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a halfpipe shape, which is a half-cylinder. The diameter of the semicircle is given as 8 cm, and the length of the halfpipe is given as 20 cm.

STEP 2: HALFPIPE VOLUME
The volume of the halfpipe is half the volume of a cylinder with a diameter of 8 cm and a length of 20 cm.
The radius of the semicircle is 8/2 = 4 cm.
The area of the semicircle is (1/2) * pi * r^2 = (1/2) * pi * (4^2) = (1/2) * pi * 16 = 8 * pi.
The volume of the halfpipe is the area of the semicircle multiplied by the length: 8 * pi * 20 = 160 * pi.
Volume = 160*pi cm^3
Volume â‰ˆ 502.65 cm^3

STEP 3: PREDICATE GENERATION
The radius of the semicircle is 4 cm.
The length of the halfpipe is 20 cm.
