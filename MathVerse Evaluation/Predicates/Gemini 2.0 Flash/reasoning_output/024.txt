PROBLEM 024 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the line a parallel b and they intersect the line c at a and b respectively, angle 1 = 50.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two parallel lines a and b are intersected by a transversal line c.
- Angle 1 is formed by line c and line a.
- Angle 2 is formed on line b and line c.
- Measure of angle 1 is given as 50 degrees.
- We need to find the degree measure of angle 2.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 and the vertically opposite angle are equal.
- The corresponding angle to angle 1, which is formed on line b is also 50 degrees.
- Angle 2 and this corresponding angle are supplementary angles, so their sum is 180 degrees.
- Therefore, the measure of angle 2 can be determined by subtracting 50 from 180.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since line a is parallel to line b, the corresponding angles are equal. Also, the supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The diagram provides enough information to find the angle 2 using properties of parallel lines.
