PROBLEM 125 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in a sector iron sheet OAB, it is known that OA = 30.0, angle AOB = 120.0, the worker master combines OA and OB to form a conical chimney cap (the joints are ignored), then the radius of the bottom circle of the chimney cap is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Sector OAB, Cone
- Points: O, A, B. In the sector, OA and OB are radii.
- Lines: OA, OB, Arc AB of the sector, the base circle of the cone
- Angles: Angle AOB = 120 degrees.
- Measurements: OA = 30
- The sector is rolled up to form a cone. Therefore, the radius OA of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone is a circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AOB in the sector is 120 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB = 30 in sector OAB.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- OA and OB are joined together to form a cone.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The arc length of the sector equals the circumference of the base of the cone.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information needed to solve the problem includes OA = 30, angle AOB = 120 degrees. The relationship between the sector and the cone is also necessary.
