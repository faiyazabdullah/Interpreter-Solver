PROBLEM 522 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: This is the graph of $y=\sqrt{6 x+7}$, which goes through (-1,1), (3,5), (5,6), (7,7). Use the graph to find an approximate solution to $\sqrt{6 x+7}=6$. Round your answer to the nearest integer.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a coordinate plane with x and y axes.
- A curve is plotted on the coordinate plane.
- The equation of the curve is given as $y = \sqrt{6x+7}$.
- The curve appears to pass through the points (-1, 1), (3, 5), (5, 6), and (7, 7) approximately.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality is explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The curve intersects the y-axis.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The equation of the curve defines a relationship between x and y coordinates.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The analysis captures the key information needed for approximating the solution, including the graph and equation.
