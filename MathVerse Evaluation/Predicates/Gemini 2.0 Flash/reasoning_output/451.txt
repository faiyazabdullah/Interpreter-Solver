PROBLEM 451 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line passes (-2,-6) and (2,-3). Write an equation that represents the line.
Use exact numbers.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a line that passes through the points (-2, -6) and (2, -3). The goal is to find the equation of the line.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked angles or perpendicular lines.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked congruent or equal entities.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The line passes through the points (-2, -6) and (2, -3).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The line's equation can be determined from the two points.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The two points are sufficient to define the line.

PREDICATES:
Point(A)
Point(B)
Line(A,B)
PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(A,B))
PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(A,B))
Equals(A,(-2,-6))
Equals(B,(2,-3))
