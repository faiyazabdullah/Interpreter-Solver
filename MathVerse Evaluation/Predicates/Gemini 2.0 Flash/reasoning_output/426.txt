PROBLEM 426 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: On an orienteering course, Valentina runs 550 metres north from point A to point B, then turns east and runs to point C. If the true bearing of C from A is 041 ^\circ T and the direct distance Valentina must run to get back to point A is d metres, find d to the nearest metre.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Points A, B, C; Lines AB, BC, AC; Triangle ABC.
- Visible measurements: Length of AB = 550 m; Angle between North and AC = 041 degrees.
- Special markings: Right angle at B.
- Implied constructions: Triangle ABC is a right triangle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is a right angle.
- Angle between North and AB is 0 degrees.
- Angle BAC = 41 degrees.
- Angle BCA = 90 - 41 = 49 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked congruent angles or lines.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and BC intersect at point B.
- Lines AC and AB intersect at point A.
- Lines AC and BC intersect at point C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle, so the Pythagorean theorem applies.
- The bearing of C from A is 041 degrees.
- The angle between the North line and AC is 41 degrees.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is captured to solve for d.
- The Pythagorean theorem can be used to find d.
