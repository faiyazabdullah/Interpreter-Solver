PROBLEM 327 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: During a rescue search, a helicopter flew b kilometres west from point X to point Y, then changed course and flew 10.7 kilometres north to point Z. If point Z is on a bearing of 335Â° T from point X:

Now, if the distance that the helicopter must fly between point Z and point X is d kilometres, calculate d to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Points X, Y, and Z; Triangle XYZ; North direction line; Bearing angle.
- Points: X, Y, Z
- Lines: Line(X, Y), Line(Y, Z), Line(X, Z), North direction line from X.
- Angles: Angle(YXZ), right angle at Y.
- Measurements: YZ = 10.7 km
- Numerical Value: Bearing angle from X to Z = 335 degrees.
- Special Markings: Right angle at Y.
- Implied constructions: Line(XY) is west and Line(YZ) is north so Line(XY) and Line(YZ) are perpendicular.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle at Y is a right angle.
- Angle between North direction and Line(XZ) = 360 - 335 = 25 degrees
- Angle YXZ = 90-25 = 65 degrees.
- Line(XY) and Line(YZ) are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality is indicated in the figure.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines XZ, XY and YZ intersect at points X, Y and Z respectively.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle XYZ is a right triangle.
- The bearing angle of Z from X is 335 degrees.
- We are given the length of YZ = 10.7 km

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the information is available to solve the problem.
