PROBLEM 421 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle divided into two smaller rectangles.
- The left rectangle has dimensions 6 and 1000. Its area is 6000.
- The total area of the large rectangle is 6096.
- The area of the right rectangle is the total area minus the area of the left rectangle.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangle has right angles at all its corners.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Opposite sides of rectangles are equal in length.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The dividing line intersects with the top and bottom sides of the large rectangle.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of the areas of the two smaller rectangles equals the area of the large rectangle.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The area of the left rectangle is 6000, and the total area is 6096. The remaining area is 6096 - 6000 = 96.

STEP 7: FINAL STEP
- Represent area relations
- Represent the subtraction needed.
- Area remaining = total Area - 6000 = 6096 - 6000 = 96
