PROBLEM 768 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In rectangle ABCD above, the length of BC is l and the length of DC is w. The area of the shaded region is given by \pi*l*w/4. If the area of the shaded region is 7*\pi, what is the total area, to the nearest whole number, of the unshaded regions of rectangle ABCD ?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: Rectangle ABCD, Ellipse (shaded region)
- Points: A, B, C, D
- Lines: AB, BC, CD, DA
- Measurements: Length of BC = l, Length of CD = w
- Special markings: Rectangle ABCD implies right angles at vertices A, B, C, D. The shaded region is an ellipse inscribed in the rectangle. The major and minor axes of the ellipse appear to be parallel to the sides of the rectangle.
- Implied constructions: The ellipse is tangent to the sides of the rectangle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The shaded region is an ellipse, not a circle. The area of the ellipse is given.
- The horizontal axis of the ellipse is along the length l and the vertical axis of the ellipse is along the width w.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Right angles: Angle(A), Angle(B), Angle(C), Angle(D)
- AB is perpendicular to AD, BC is perpendicular to CD, AB is perpendicular to BC, AD is perpendicular to CD.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB = CD, BC = DA

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at the vertices of the rectangle: A, B, C, D.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the ellipse (shaded region) is given as \pi*l*w/4. The area is also given as 7*\pi.
- Therefore, \pi*l*w/4 = 7*\pi, which simplifies to l*w = 28.
- The total area of the rectangle is l*w. The unshaded area is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the ellipse.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the necessary information. The area of the rectangle is l*w. The area of the shaded region is \pi*l*w/4. The area of the unshaded region is l*w - \pi*l*w/4. The question asks for the numerical value when the shaded area is 7*\pi.
