PROBLEM 772 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above,line k and line l intersect perpendicularly, and line k and line m intersect at an angle of x°. Lines l and m are not parallel. Which of the following cannot be the value of x?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three lines: k, l, and m.
- Line k and line l intersect at a point forming a right angle.
- Line k and line m intersect at a point forming an angle labeled as x°.
- Lines l and m are not parallel.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Line k is perpendicular to line l.
- The angle between line k and line m is x°.
- Since l and m are not parallel, x cannot be 90° (otherwise k would be perpendicular to both lines, and therefore l and m would be parallel).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The relationship between the perpendicularity of k and l and the angle x between k and m determines whether l and m are parallel.
- If x were 90°, then lines l and m would be parallel.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should capture the perpendicular relationship between k and l, the angle x between k and m, and the fact that lines l and m are not parallel (which means x cannot be 90).

PREDICATES:
Line(k)
Line(l)
Line(m)
Perpendicular(Line(k),Line(l))
MeasureOf(Angle(k,m),x)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(l,k)),90)
