PROBLEM 764 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, this is a rectangle and the lengths of the sides are x-3 and x+3 respectively. If the perimeter of the rectangle above is 72, what is the value of x?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle.
- The sides of the rectangle are labeled as x-3 and x+3.
- The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 72.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as there are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- A rectangle has four right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Opposite sides of the rectangle are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is available.

PREDICATES:
Rectangle(Rectangle(1))
LengthOf(Line(1))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(1)),x+3)
WidthOf(Rectangle(1))
Equals(WidthOf(Rectangle(1)),x-3)
PerimeterOf(Rectangle(1))
Equals(PerimeterOf(Rectangle(1)),72)
Equals(SumOf(x+3,x+3,x-3,x-3),72)
