PROBLEM 761 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the triangle above, angle M is 80 degrees and angle Q is 30 degrees. The length of MN is 4. Which of the following must be true?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle labeled as Triangle(M, N, Q).
- The length of side MN is given as 4.
- The length of side NQ is given as 4 + p.
- The length of side MQ is given as 4 + r.
- Angle M is given as 80 degrees.
- Angle Q is given as 30 degrees.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can find the measure of angle N.
- Angle N = 180 - (80 + 30) = 180 - 110 = 70 degrees.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked congruent angles or sides.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Law of Sines can be applied to the triangle:
  - MN / sin(Q) = NQ / sin(M) = MQ / sin(N)
  - 4 / sin(30) = (4+p) / sin(80) = (4+r) / sin(70)
