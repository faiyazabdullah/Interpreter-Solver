PROBLEM 667 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this question we will find the surface area of the following solid hemispher with a radius of 6:

What is the area of the circular base of the hemisphere?

Round your answer to three decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a hemisphere.
- The radius of the hemisphere is given as 6.
- We need to find the area of the circular base of the hemisphere.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the hemisphere is a circle.
- The radius of the circle is 6.
- The area of a circle is πr^2, where r is the radius.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable for this problem.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable for this problem.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable for this problem.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the base of the hemisphere (circle) is π * 6^2 = 36π.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the area of the circular base.
- The radius is given as 6.
- We need to compute 36π and round to three decimal places.
