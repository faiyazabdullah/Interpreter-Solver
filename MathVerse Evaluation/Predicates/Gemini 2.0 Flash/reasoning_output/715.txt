================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the figure shown, rounded to two decimal places. Assume that the solid is three quarters of a cylinder. The height is 12 cm and radius is 5 cm.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a three-quarters cylinder.
- The radius of the cylinder is 5 cm.
- The height (length) of the cylinder is 12 cm.
- The curved surface represents 3/4 of the total curved surface area.
- The two circular faces each are 3/4 of a full circle.

STEP 2: CYLINDER SURFACE AREA ANALYSIS
- Surface area of 3/4 cylinder can be calculated as follows:
    - Area of the curved surface = (3/4) * (2 * pi * r * h)
    - Area of two 3/4 circular faces = 2 * (3/4) * (pi * r^2)
    - Area of rectangular faces created by cutting the cylinder = 2 * r * h
- Total surface area = (3/4) * (2 * pi * r * h) + 2 * (3/4) * (pi * r^2) + 2 * r * h
- Given r = 5 cm and h = 12 cm
- Total surface area = (3/4) * (2 * pi * 5 * 12) + 2 * (3/4) * (pi * 5^2) + 2 * 5 * 12
- Total surface area = (3/4) * (120 * pi) + (3/2) * (25 * pi) + 120
- Total surface area = 90 * pi + 37.5 * pi + 120
- Total surface area = 127.5 * pi + 120

STEP 3: FINAL CALCULATION
- Total surface area = (127.5 * pi) + 120
- Total surface area = (127.5 * 3.14159) + 120
- Total surface area = 400.53075 + 120
- Total surface area = 520.53075
- Total surface area â‰ˆ 520.53 cm^2
