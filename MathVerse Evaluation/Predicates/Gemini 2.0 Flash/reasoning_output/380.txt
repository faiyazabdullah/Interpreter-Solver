PROBLEM 380 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, one leg measuring \sqrt{3}. Find the length of side h.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a right-angled triangle ABC with a right angle at B. Angle A is 30 degrees, and angle C is 60 degrees. The length of side AB is given as sqrt(3). The length of side BC is labeled as h.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle ABC is a right angle, so it measures 90 degrees. Angle BAC is given as 30 degrees, and angle BCA is given as 60 degrees. Sides AB and BC are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked congruent sides or angles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines AB and BC intersect at point B. Lines AC and BC intersect at point C. Lines AB and AC intersect at point A.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle. The sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees. Since angle ABC is 90 degrees, the sum of angles BAC and BCA is 90 degrees. In this case, 30 + 60 = 90. The sides AB and BC form the right angle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The provided information includes all the necessary data to determine the length of side BC.
