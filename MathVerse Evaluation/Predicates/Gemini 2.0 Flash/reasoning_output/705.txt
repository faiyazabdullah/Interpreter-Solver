PROBLEM 705 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the following trapezoidal prism. The right rectangle surface has edges of 3cm and 10cm. The trapezoid surface has edges of 3cm, 10cm and 13cm.  Find the surface area of the trapezoidal prism.

Give your answer to the nearest one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure is a trapezoidal prism.
- The prism has two trapezoid faces, two rectangle faces (10cm x 13cm and 10cm x 3cm) and one rectangle face (10cm x ycm, y is unknown in figure but can be derived by Pythagorean theorem).
- We are given the lengths of the sides as 10cm, 13cm, and 3cm for the trapezoid base. We are also given 10cm as the height of the prism.
- The length of one side of the trapezoid top face is labeled y cm.
- We can find y using the Pythagorean theorem because we have a right triangle with sides of length 10cm and (13-3) = 10cm. So, y = sqrt(10^2 + 10^2) = 10*sqrt(2).
- Area of each trapezoid face: 0.5*(13+3)*10 = 80cm^2
- Area of bottom rectangle face: 13*10 = 130 cm^2
- Area of top rectangle face: y*10 = 10*sqrt(2)*10 = 100*sqrt(2) cm^2
- Area of the rectangle face: 3*10 = 30 cm^2

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The rectangles and prism structure indicate many right angles.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Two trapezoid faces are congruent.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at vertices of the shapes.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The relationships between the sides are defined by the trapezoid and prism definitions.
- The value of y is derived by Pythagorean theorem from the right triangle on the top face.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All measurements are included for calculating the surface area.

STEP 7: Find the surface area.
- Two trapezoids: 2 * 0.5 * (13+3) * 10 = 2 * 80 = 160
- Bottom rectangle: 13 * 10 = 130
- Left Rectangle: 3 * 10 = 30
- Top Rectangle (hypotenuse): 10 * sqrt(2) * 10 = 100 * sqrt(2)
- Total Area = 160 + 130 + 30 + 100*sqrt(2) = 320 + 100*sqrt(2) â‰ˆ 320 + 141.4 = 461.4
