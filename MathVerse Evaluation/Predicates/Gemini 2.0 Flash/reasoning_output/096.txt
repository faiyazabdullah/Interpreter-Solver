PROBLEM 096 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, points A, B, and P are three points on circle O, if angle AOB = 40.0, then the degree of angle APB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle with center O. Points A, B, and P lie on the circle. Angle AOB is given as 40 degrees. The goal is to find the measure of angle APB. Lines OA, OB, AP, BP are present.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
O is the center of the circle. A, B, and P are points on the circle. OA and OB are radii. AB and AP are chords. Angle AOB is a central angle. Angle APB is an inscribed angle intercepting the same arc AB.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle AOB = 40 degrees. Angle APB is an inscribed angle. The relationship between central and inscribed angles is that the inscribed angle is half of the central angle when they subtend the same arc.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
OA = OB since they are radii of the same circle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines OA and OB intersect at O. Points A, B, and P lie on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The measure of the inscribed angle APB is half the measure of the central angle AOB.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The given information is sufficient to find angle APB.
