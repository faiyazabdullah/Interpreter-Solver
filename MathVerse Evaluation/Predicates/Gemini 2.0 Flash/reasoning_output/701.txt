PROBLEM 701 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the triangular prism shown. The height is 21 cm. The base is an isosceles triangle with waist length of 10 cm and base length of 12 cm.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The figure is a triangular prism. The base is an isosceles triangle, and the lateral faces are rectangles.
- Points: No points are explicitly labeled.
- Lines: Several line segments are visible, forming the edges of the prism and the altitude of the triangular base.
- Measurements:
    - Triangle: base = 12 cm, waist = 10 cm, height = 8 cm
    - Prism: height = 21 cm
- Markings: A right angle symbol indicates the altitude of the triangular base is perpendicular to the base. Tick marks indicate that the two sides of length 10cm are congruent.
- Implied Constructions: The altitude of the triangle is perpendicular to its base.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- A right angle is marked between the base of the isosceles triangle and its altitude.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two sides of the isosceles triangle with lengths of 10 cm are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The altitude intersects the base of the triangle at a right angle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The figure is a triangular prism with an isosceles triangular base.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is included to calculate the surface area of the prism.
