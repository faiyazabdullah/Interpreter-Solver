PROBLEM 251 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In a triangle with three sides length 29, 50, and 61. Find x. Round the angle measure to the nearest degree.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle.
- The sides of the triangle have lengths 29, 50, and 61.
- One angle is labeled as xÂ°.
- The triangle looks like a right triangle.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We need to find the value of angle x.
- We can use the cosine function to relate the sides and the angle x.
- Cos(x) = Adjacent/Hypotenuse
- Cos(x) = 29/61 or Cos(x) = 50/61 depending on where the right angle is. It appears that the triangle is a right triangle with the right angle between sides 29 and 50.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use the Law of Cosines to find angle x.
- 61^2 = 29^2 + 50^2 - 2*29*50*cos(angle opposite the side of length 61)
- 61^2 = 29^2 + 50^2 - 2*29*50*cos(angle x) if angle x is opposite the side of length 61.
- Triangle has sides 29, 50, 61.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the necessary information to solve for angle x.
