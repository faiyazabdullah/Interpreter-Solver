PROBLEM 572 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex of (-8,8). f(x)=-5(x+4)^2+8. Which function has a greater maximum?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a parabola opening downwards. The parabola is labelled as y = g(x). The vertex of the parabola is located at (-8, 8). The x and y axes are shown. The grid lines indicate the scale. There are x-axis values from -11 to 3 and y-axis values from -5 to 9. Another function is defined as f(x) = -5(x+4)^2 + 8. The task is to find which function has a greater maximum.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Not applicable in this diagram

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The parabola g(x) intersects the x-axis at approximately x = -5 and x = -11.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The parabola is a quadratic function with a maximum value. The vertex of the parabola represents the maximum point.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We need the vertex of g(x) and the equation of f(x). The vertex of g(x) is (-8, 8). The equation of f(x) is f(x) = -5(x+4)^2 + 8.
