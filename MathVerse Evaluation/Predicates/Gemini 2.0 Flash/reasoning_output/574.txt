PROBLEM 574 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Simon has a certain length of fencing to enclose a rectangular area. The quadratic function A with a vertec of (10, 100) models the rectangle's area (in square meters) as a function of its width (in meters). It intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). Which of these statements are true?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parabola-shaped curve representing the area of a rectangle as a function of its width.
- The curve intersects the x-axis (width) at (0,0) and (20,0).
- The vertex of the parabola is at (10, 100).
- The x-axis represents width in meters.
- The y-axis represents area in square meters.
- There is label A near the curve.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Due to the symmetry of the parabola, the x-coordinate of the vertex (10) is the midpoint between the x-intercepts (0 and 20).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The curve intersects the x-axis at (0, 0) and (20, 0).
- The vertex of the parabola is at (10, 100).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area is a quadratic function of the width.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The key information needed is the coordinates of the intercepts and the vertex.
