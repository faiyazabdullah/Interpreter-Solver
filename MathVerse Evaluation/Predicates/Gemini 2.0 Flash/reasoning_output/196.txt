PROBLEM 196 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, a torus carpet is to be laid in the lobby of a hotel. The worker only measures the length of the chord AB of the great circle that is tangent to the small circle, and then calculates the area of ​​the torus. If the measured length of AB is 8.0, the area of ​​the torus is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two concentric circles are visible with center O.
- Line AB is tangent to the inner circle and is a chord of the outer circle.
- The length of line segment AB is 8.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Point O is the center of both circles.
- AB is a chord of the larger circle.
- AB is tangent to the inner circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- A perpendicular line can be drawn from O to the point of tangency on AB. Let's call the point of tangency C.
- Angle OCA is a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Since OC is perpendicular to the chord AB, OC bisects AB. Thus, AC = CB.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point C lies on AB and the inner circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- OC is the radius of the inner circle.
- OA is the radius of the outer circle.
- Triangle OCA is a right triangle.
- AB = 8, so AC = CB = 4.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The diagram represents concentric circles and a tangent line, essential for calculating torus area which depends on the difference between the radii of the two circles. The length of AB enables finding the radii.
