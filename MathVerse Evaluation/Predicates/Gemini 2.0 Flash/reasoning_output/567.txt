PROBLEM 567 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening downward with a vertex of (-5,6). f(x)=4x^2-108. Do the functions have the same concavity, f(x) and g(x)?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a curve representing the graph of a function y = g(x).
- The graph is a parabola opening downwards.
- The vertex of the parabola is at approximately (-5, 6).
- The problem states the function f(x)=4x^2-108.
- The problem asks whether f(x) and g(x) have the same concavity.

STEP 2: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The parabola is not marked with any specific congruence symbols.
- The only numerical data provided is the vertex of the parabola.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The parabola opens downwards, implying a negative leading coefficient.
- The function f(x)=4x^2-108 has a positive leading coefficient (4).
- Therefore, the concavity of f(x) is upward, and the concavity of g(x) is downward.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates must define g(x) as a downward opening parabola with a vertex at (-5, 6) and define f(x) as a quadratic equation with a positive leading coefficient.
