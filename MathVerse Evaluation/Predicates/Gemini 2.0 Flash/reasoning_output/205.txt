PROBLEM 205 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a right triangle with two angles 30 and 60 degrees. The length of hypotenuse is x and other sides are y and 21. Find y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle.
- The vertices of the triangle are not explicitly labeled.
- The angles are given as 30 degrees, 60 degrees, and 90 degrees.
- The side lengths are x, y, and 21.
- There is a right angle symbol.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle has a right angle.
- The angles are 30, 60, and 90 degrees.
- The sum of the angles is 180 degrees.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle is a 30-60-90 right triangle.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometric ratios to relate the sides and angles.
- The side opposite the 30-degree angle is half the length of the hypotenuse.
- The side opposite the 60-degree angle is sqrt(3)/2 times the length of the hypotenuse.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We are given the side adjacent to the 60-degree angle which has a length of 21.
- We need to find y which is opposite the 60-degree angle.
- We can use trigonometric ratios.
