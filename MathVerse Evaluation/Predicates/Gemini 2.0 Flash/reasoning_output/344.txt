PROBLEM 344 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: At a point during the flight, a plane is 42 kilometres south and 57 kilometres west of the airport it left from.


Find the size of the angle marked b to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows a point representing Sydney, a plane, and a right triangle.
- Points: There is a point labeled "Sydney" and another point at the right angle of the triangle. Let's call the right angle point A, the plane point B, and Sydney point O.
- Lines: Lines connect the points.  Line segments OA, AB, and BO form a right triangle.  A vertical line extends north from Sydney. A horizontal line extends from Sydney.
- Measurements: OA = 42 km, AB = 57 km, and Angle OAB is a right angle. The angle between the vertical line at Sydney and BO is labeled 'b'.
- Special Markings: There is a right angle marking at point A.
- Implied constructions: We have a right triangle OAB.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle OAB is a right angle.  Therefore, OA is perpendicular to AB.
- Angle b is the angle between the vertical line and BO.
- Angle AOB is an acute angle in the right triangle.
- Angle ABO is also an acute angle in the right triangle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly congruent shapes or lengths.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines OA and AB intersect at A.
- Line BO is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- Sydney is at point O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle OAB is a right triangle.
- The Pythagorean theorem applies to the sides of the triangle.
- Trigonometric relationships can be used to relate the sides and angles of the triangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the right triangle and the lengths of two of its sides.
- We have identified angle b as an angle to be found.
- The predicates below will provide enough information to solve the problem using trigonometric functions.
