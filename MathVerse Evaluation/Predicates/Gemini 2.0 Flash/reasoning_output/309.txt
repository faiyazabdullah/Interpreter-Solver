PROBLEM 309 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find x for the equilateral triangle R S T if R S = x + 9, S T = 2 x, and R T = 3 x - 9.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle RST.
- The vertices are labeled R, S, and T.
- The length of side RS is labeled x + 9.
- The length of side ST is labeled 2x.
- The length of side RT is labeled 3x - 9.
- The problem states that the triangle is equilateral.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit angle markings.
- Since the triangle is equilateral, all angles are equal and measure 60 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal in length: RS = ST = RT.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides RS, ST, and RT intersect at vertices R, S, and T, respectively.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We have the equations: x + 9 = 2x and 2x = 3x - 9.
- The triangle is equilateral, so all sides are equal.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all shapes, points, and measurements.
- We have identified the equilateral property.
- The given information is sufficient to solve for x.
