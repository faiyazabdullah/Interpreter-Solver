PROBLEM 504 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a U-shape curve opens upwards and passes (0,0). Determine whether the graphed function is even, odd, or neither.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a U-shaped curve that opens upwards.
- The curve passes through the origin (0, 0).
- The x and y axes are visible.
- The graph appears symmetric with respect to the y-axis.

STEP 2: SYMMETRY ANALYSIS
- A function is even if f(x) = f(-x) for all x.
- A function is odd if f(x) = -f(-x) for all x.
- Visually, the graph is symmetric about the y-axis.  This implies that f(x) = f(-x).
- Since the graph passes through (0,0), if it were odd, it should be symmetric with respect to the origin.  However, since it is symmetric about y-axis, it implies it is an even function.
