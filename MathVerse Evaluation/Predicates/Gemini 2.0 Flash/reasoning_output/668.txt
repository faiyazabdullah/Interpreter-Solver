PROBLEM 668 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the following hemisphere with a radius of 8. Find the total surface area.

Round your answer to three decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a hemisphere.
- The radius of the hemisphere is given as 8.
- The total surface area of the hemisphere needs to be calculated.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the hemisphere is a circle.
- The radius of the circle is 8.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit angles are shown.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruencies are shown.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- No intersections are specifically indicated.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The surface area of a hemisphere is given by 3*pi*r^2.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The radius is needed to calculate the total surface area.
- The radius is given.
