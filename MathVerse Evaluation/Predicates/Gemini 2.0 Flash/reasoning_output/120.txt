PROBLEM 120 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the length of the generatrix of the cone is 5.0, and the length of the height line is 4.0, then the bottom area of ​​the cone is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a cone. The height of the cone is labeled as 4.0. The length of the generatrix (slant height) of the cone is labeled as 5.0. The bottom of the cone is a circle. There is a right angle implied between the height of the cone and the radius of the circular base.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The base of the cone is a circle. The height of the cone is perpendicular to the radius of the base.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There is a right angle formed by the height and the radius of the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruence or equality information is given.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The height intersects the center of the circular base.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the radius of the base.
radius^2 + height^2 = generatrix^2
radius^2 + 4^2 = 5^2
radius^2 + 16 = 25
radius^2 = 9
radius = 3

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The height and slant height are given.  The implicit right angle allows the base radius to be calculated via Pythagorean theorem. This is all information needed.
