PROBLEM 226 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In regular hexagon U V W X Y Z, W Y is perpendicular to X U, and the side is 12 centimeters long. Find W Y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Hexagon, Triangles, Lines, Angles
- Points: U, V, W, X, Y, Z
- Lines: UV, VW, WX, XY, YZ, ZU, WY, XU
- Measurements: Side length = 12 cm
- Markings: Equal length markings on hexagon sides, right angle marking where WY intersects XU.
- Implied constructions: Center of hexagon, radii from center to vertices.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- A hexagon can be inscribed in a circle. The center of the circle is the intersection of the diagonals.
- Radii are lines from the center to each vertex

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle between WY and XU is 90 degrees.
- Internal angles of a regular hexagon are 120 degrees.
- The hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All sides of the hexagon are equal in length.
- All interior angles of the hexagon are equal.
- The triangles formed by connecting the center to the vertices are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- WY and XU intersect at a point.
- The intersection point appears to be the center of the hexagon.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The hexagon is regular.
- The side length is given.
- WY is perpendicular to XU.
- Can apply properties of regular hexagons and equilateral triangles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Need predicates for: regular hexagon, side length, perpendicular lines.
- Ensure the center is defined, and related to the vertices.
- Check for implicit relationships from regular hexagon properties.
