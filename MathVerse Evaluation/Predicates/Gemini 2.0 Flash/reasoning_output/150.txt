PROBLEM 150 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, Xiaoming designed two right angles to measure the width of the river BC, he measured AB = 2.0, BD = frac {7.0}{3.0}, CE = 9.0, then the width of the river BC is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a geometric figure with two right triangles, Triangle(A,B,D) and Triangle(E,C,A). We have the following points: A, B, C, D, E. We have the following line segments: AB, BD, CE, CB, AC, AD, AE, DE. There are right angles at B and C. We are given AB = 2, BD = 7/3, CE = 9. We want to find BC. Triangles ABD and ACE appear to be similar.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle ABD and angle ACE are right angles. Angle A is common to both triangles ABD and ACE. Thus, triangles ABD and ACE are similar. Angle ADB is equal to angle AEC. Line BD is perpendicular to AB and line CE is perpendicular to AC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Triangles ABD and ACE are similar. Thus, their corresponding sides are proportional.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
B lies on AC, and D lies on AE.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since Triangle(A,B,D) is similar to Triangle(A,C,E), we have the ratio AB/AC = BD/CE. Let BC = x. Then AC = AB + BC = 2 + x. Therefore, 2/(2+x) = (7/3)/9. Solving for x will give BC.
