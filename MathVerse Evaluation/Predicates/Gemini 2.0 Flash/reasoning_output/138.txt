PROBLEM 138 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the light source P is directly above the crossbar AB, the shadow of AB under the light is CD, AB parallel  CD, AB = 2.0, CD = 5.0, the distance between point P and CD is 3.0, then the distance between AB and CD is ().
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a diagram with points P, A, B, C, D. Line segment AB is parallel to line segment CD. PA extended passes through C and PB extended passes through D. The length of AB is given as 2, the length of CD is given as 5, and the perpendicular distance between P and CD is given as 3. The distance between AB and CD is unknown.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
AB and CD are parallel.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
AB = 2, CD = 5.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines PA and PC are collinear. Lines PB and PD are collinear.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Triangle PAB is similar to triangle PCD.
Let the perpendicular distance from P to AB be h1, and the perpendicular distance from AB to CD be h2.
We are given h1 + h2 = 3.
Then AB/CD = h1 / (h1+h2)
2/5 = h1 / 3
h1 = 6/5 = 1.2
h2 = 3 - h1 = 3 - 1.2 = 1.8

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The analysis captures all given information and relevant relationships.
