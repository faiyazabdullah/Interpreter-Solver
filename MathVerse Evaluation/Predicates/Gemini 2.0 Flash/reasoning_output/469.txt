PROBLEM 469 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0).


State the centre of the semicircle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a semicircle.
- The semicircle passes through the points (-7, 0), (-5, 5), (0, 7), (5, 5), and (7, 0).
- The semicircle is above the x-axis.
- The graph is on a coordinate plane.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The points (-7, 0) and (7, 0) are on the semicircle. The line connecting these points is a diameter. The center of the circle must lie on the perpendicular bisector of this line.
- The x-coordinate of the center is 0.
- The point (0, 7) is on the semicircle. The distance from (0, 0) to (0, 7) is 7. Thus the radius is 7. The center is (0, 0).

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since the semicircle passes through (-7, 0) and (7, 0), the line segment connecting these points is a diameter.
- The midpoint of the line segment connecting (-7, 0) and (7, 0) is (0, 0).
- The radius of the semicircle is 7 because the semicircle passes through (0, 7).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The center of the semicircle is (0,0).
