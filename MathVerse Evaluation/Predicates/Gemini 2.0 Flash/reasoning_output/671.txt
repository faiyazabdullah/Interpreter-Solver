PROBLEM 671 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: We want to find the surface area of this shape. Assume that both boxes are identical in size. The box has sides of length 25, 20 and 33. The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11.

Find the surface area of the solid.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains two identical rectangular prisms and a cylinder connecting them.
- The dimensions of the rectangular prism are 25, 20, and 33.
- The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11.
- There are dashed lines indicating hidden edges of the prisms and cylinder.
- The distance between the two rectangular prisms is indicated as 11.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The cylinder has a radius of 6.
- The height of the cylinder is 11.
- The circular faces of the cylinder are flush with the faces of the rectangular prisms.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangular prisms have right angles at all corners.
- The cylinder is perpendicular to the faces of the rectangular prisms it connects.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two rectangular prisms are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The cylinder connects the two rectangular prisms.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height of the cylinder is the distance between the two prisms.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information about the dimensions of the prisms and cylinder is included.
- All relationships have been described.
