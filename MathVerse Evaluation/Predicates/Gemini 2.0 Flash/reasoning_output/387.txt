PROBLEM 387 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A circle with a radius of $8 \mathrm{~cm}$. Find the circumference of the circle shown, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Circle
- Points: The center of the circle and points on the circle (not labeled)
- Lines: radius of circle
- Measurements: Radius = 8 cm
- No special markings visible other than the radius length
- Implied constructions: Radius

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center of the circle is present
- Radius length is given
- No diameters, chords or tangents visible

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles explicitly marked
- No perpendicular relationships are visible

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All radii of the same circle are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- No intersecting lines.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2 * pi * r, where r is the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates accurately represent the given information from the image.
- The relationship that the length of the radius is 8 cm is correctly expressed in predicates

PREDICATES:
Circle(1)
IsRadiusOf(Line(A,B),Circle(1))
LengthOf(Line(A,B))
Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,B)),8)
