PROBLEM 640 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A hollow cylindrical pipe has the dimensions shown in the figure. The outer diameter is 2.1 centimeters. The inner diameter is 1.8 centimeters. The length is 13 centimeters.

The pipe is made of a particularly strong metal.

Calculate the weight of the pipe if 1 (cm)^3 of the metal weighs 5.3g , giving your answer correct to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a hollow cylindrical pipe.
- The outer diameter of the pipe is 2.1 cm. The outer radius is half of that.
- The inner diameter of the pipe is 1.8 cm. The inner radius is half of that.
- The length of the pipe is 13 cm.
- The weight of the metal is 5.3g per cm^3

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are two circles in the cylindrical pipe: an outer circle and an inner circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are explicitly marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or similar figures are explicitly shown.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- No intersections are explicitly marked.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the pipe can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the inner cylinder from the volume of the outer cylinder.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The dimensions required for volume calculation are present in the image.
