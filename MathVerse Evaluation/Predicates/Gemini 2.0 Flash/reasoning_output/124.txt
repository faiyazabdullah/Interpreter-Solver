PROBLEM 124 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, cut a circle and a sector piece of paper on the paper so that it can form a cone model. If the radius of the circle is 1.0 and the central angle of the sector is equal to 90.0, then the radius of the sector is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image contains a square, a circle, a sector, and a cone. The side of the square is labeled as 1. There is a quarter circle (sector with a 90-degree angle) inside the square and a smaller circle. Figure 2 displays a cone. Figure 1 shows a quarter circle and a full circle that, when put together appropriately, form the cone depicted in Figure 2.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There is a circle and a sector. The radius of the circle is given as 1.0. Let's say the sector has a radius of R. When this sector is folded to create the cone, the arc length of the sector equals the circumference of the base circle of the cone.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
One angle inside the square is shown to be 90 degrees, indicating a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The side of the square is equal to 1.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The circle and sector are placed within the square in a particular arrangement.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the circle.
The arc length of the sector is $\frac{90}{360} * 2\pi R = \frac{1}{4} * 2\pi R = \frac{\pi R}{2}$.
The circumference of the circle is $2\pi r = 2\pi (1) = 2\pi$. Therefore, $\frac{\pi R}{2} = 2\pi$, implying $R = 4$.
