PROBLEM 531 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $(1.2,5.5)$ and an amplitude of 3.5 . What is the midline equation of the function?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a graph of a trigonometric function. The x-axis and y-axis are visible.
- The function appears to be a cosine function.
- A maximum point of the function is labeled (1.2, 5.5).
- The amplitude of the function is given as 3.5.
- The problem asks for the midline equation of the function. The midline is the horizontal line halfway between the maximum and minimum values of the function.

STEP 2: DETERMINE THE MIDLINE
- The maximum value of the function is 5.5.
- The amplitude is 3.5.
- The minimum value of the function is 5.5 - 2 * 3.5 = 5.5 - 7 = -1.5.
- The midline is the average of the maximum and minimum values: (5.5 + (-1.5)) / 2 = 4 / 2 = 2.
- Therefore, the midline equation is y = 2.

STEP 3: REPRESENT GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES AND CONSTRAINTS
- I'll represent the point (1.2, 5.5) as Point(A).
- I'll represent the amplitude as Amplitude.
- I'll represent the maximum value as MaxValue.
- I'll represent the minimum value as MinValue.
- I'll represent the midline as Midline.
- I'll represent the y-axis as Line(Y).
- I'll represent the x-axis as Line(X).
