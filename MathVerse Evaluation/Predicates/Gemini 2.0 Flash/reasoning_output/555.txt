================================================================================
Question: On the following unit circle, an acute angle $\theta$ is formed by a radius and x-axis.. Which two of the following expressions are OPPOSITE of $\cos (\theta)$ ? Choose 2 answers:
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle, x and y axes, a line representing the radius, and an angle theta.
- The circle is centered at the origin (0,0).
- The radius forms an acute angle theta with the x-axis.
- The circle appears to be a unit circle, as indicated by the grid lines.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle: The image contains a circle centered at the origin.
- Radius: A radius of the circle is shown, forming an angle theta with the x-axis.
- Unit Circle: The grid indicates that the radius is of length 1, making this a unit circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle: An acute angle theta is formed between the radius and the x-axis.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 1.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The circle is centered at the origin.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since it is a unit circle, the x-coordinate of the point where the radius intersects the circle is cos(theta), and the y-coordinate is sin(theta).
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image captures all necessary geometric information.
