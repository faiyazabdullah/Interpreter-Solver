PROBLEM 739 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A pyramid has been removed from a rectangular prism, as shown in the figure. The height of the rectangular prism is 8cm, its length and width are 15cm and 9cm respectively. Find the volume of this composite solid.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Rectangular prism and a pyramid removed from it.
- Points: Several points are implied, but not labeled. We can imagine vertices A, B, C, D on the bottom face, and similar on the top.
- Lines: Edges of the prism, edges of the removed pyramid.
- Measurements: Height = 8cm, length = 15cm, width = 9cm.
- Markings: The segments on the top square indicate equal lengths suggesting a vertex of the pyramid lies directly below the center of the top square.
- Implied Constructions: The pyramid's apex appears to be at one of the bottom vertices of the prism.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The faces of the rectangular prism are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The top face of the rectangular prism has two pairs of equal sides marked with ticks. This implies the top face is a square with side equal to 1/2 * 15 = 7.5 cm.  However, this is impossible since it is given that length = 15 and width = 9. Therefore the marks on the top indicate that edges of length (1/2)*15 = 7.5 are equal

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The pyramid's apex lies at a vertex of the rectangular prism.
- The apex of the pyramid appears to be on the front-left bottom vertex.
- The base of the pyramid is on the top face of the prism.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The diagram illustrates a composite solid: a rectangular prism with a pyramid removed.
- The volume of the remaining solid can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the pyramid from the volume of the rectangular prism.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the necessary information is present in the diagram to define the rectangular prism's dimensions and the location of the removed pyramid.
- We have captured that the base of the pyramid lies on the top face and the apex at a bottom vertex.
- The dimensions are: 15cm, 9cm, and 8cm.
- The pyramid's base is a triangle. The tick marks on the prism indicate the height of triangle in pyramid's base is LengthOf(AB)/2
