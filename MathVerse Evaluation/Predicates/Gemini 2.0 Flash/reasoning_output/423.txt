PROBLEM 423 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: After two meteoroids collide at point A, one starts travelling in the direction of point B, while the other starts travelling in the direction of point C, with an angle of 53^\circ  between the two directions. The meteoroid projected in the direction of B is moving at a speed of 7860 km/h, while the other is moving at a speed of 10170 km/h.


What distance will the meteoroid travelling towards point B have covered after 29 minutes?

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows two lines originating from a point that we can label A, and directions to points B and C. The angle between the lines to B and C is given as 53 degrees. The speeds of the meteoroids are given.
- Points: There are points A, B, and C in the diagram.
- Lines: There are lines representing the directions of motion towards points B and C.
- Angles: The angle between the lines to B and C is 53 degrees.
- Measurements: Speed towards B = 7860 km/h, Speed towards C = 10170 km/h.

STEP 2: ANGLE ANALYSIS
- The angle between line AB and line AC is 53 degrees.

STEP 3: DISTANCE CALCULATION - This is not a geometric property of the figure itself, so no predicate is created.

STEP 4: PREDICATE CREATION
Based on the analysis, here are the geometric predicates:

PREDICATES:
Point(A)
Point(B)
Point(C)
Line(A,B)
Line(A,C)
MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C)),53)
