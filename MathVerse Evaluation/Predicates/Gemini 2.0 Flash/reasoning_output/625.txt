PROBLEM 625 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A cake maker has rectangular boxes measuring $40 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and 20 $\mathrm{cm}$ in width. The four vertices of the rectangle are (0,0), (0,20), (40,20), (40,0). She often receives orders for cakes in the shape of an ellipse, and wants to determine the largest possible cake that can be made to fit inside the rectangular box.

State the coordinates of the center of the cake in the form $(a, b)$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a rectangle and an ellipse inscribed within it. The vertices of the rectangle are approximately (0,0), (40,0), (40,20), and (0,20). The ellipse is centered within the rectangle. The x-axis extends from -20 to 40, and the y-axis extends from -10 to 40.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The ellipse is not a circle, but we can infer its center lies at the midpoint of the rectangle's diagonals.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The rectangle has right angles at each vertex.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The opposite sides of the rectangle are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The ellipse is inscribed in the rectangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The center of the ellipse coincides with the center of the rectangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We need to find the center of the ellipse, which is the same as the center of the rectangle. The bottom-left corner of the rectangle is (0,0) and the top-right corner is (40,20). The center would therefore be ((40+0)/2, (20+0)/2) = (20, 10).
