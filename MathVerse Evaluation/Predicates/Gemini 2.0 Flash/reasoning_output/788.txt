PROBLEM 788 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the diagram above, There are two triangles ABC an BDE, where BE is on AB. Angle A is congruent to angle BED, and angle C is congruent to angle D. If the ratio of the length of AB to the length of EB is 5:1, and the area of the triangle BED is 5*a^2 + 10, what is the area of triangle ABC?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Triangle ABC, Triangle BDE
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: AB, BC, AC, BD, DE, BE
- Angles: Angle A, Angle C, Angle ABC, Angle BED, Angle D, Angle DBE
- Special markings: Angle A is congruent to Angle BED, Angle C is congruent to Angle D
- Relationship: Point E is on line AB

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles in the diagram

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle A is congruent to Angle BED
- Angle C is congruent to Angle D

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Triangle ABC is similar to Triangle EBD because Angle A is congruent to Angle BED, and Angle C is congruent to Angle D
- Ratio of AB to EB is 5:1, i.e., LengthOf(AB)/LengthOf(EB) = 5/1

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point E lies on line AB

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since Angle A is congruent to Angle BED, and Angle C is congruent to Angle D, triangles ABC and EBD are similar (AA similarity).
- Therefore, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal: AB/EB = BC/BD = AC/ED.
- The area of triangle BED is given as 5*a^2 + 10.
- Since AB/EB = 5/1, AB = 5*EB.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the necessary information about shapes, points, lines, angles, congruence, similarity, and the given ratio of AB/EB is identified and listed in the above steps.
