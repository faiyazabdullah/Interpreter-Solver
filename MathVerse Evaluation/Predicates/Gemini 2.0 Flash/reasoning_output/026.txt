PROBLEM 026 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in order to measure the height of the school flagpole, Xiaodong uses a bamboo pole with a length of 3.2 as a measuring tool, and moves the bamboo pole so that the top of the bamboo pole and the shadow of the top of the flag pole fall on the same point on the ground. At this time, the distance between the bamboo pole and this point is 8.0 , 22.0 from the flagpole, the height of the flagpole is ().
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a flagpole, a bamboo pole, and lines representing the line of sight.
- The bamboo pole has a height of 3.2m.
- The distance from the observation point to the bamboo pole is 8m.
- The distance from the observation point to the base of the flagpole is 22m.
- The bamboo pole and the flagpole are assumed to be perpendicular to the ground.
- The line of sight forms similar triangles.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Both the flagpole and the bamboo pole are perpendicular to the ground.
- This implies right angles.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are similar triangles formed by the line of sight, the bamboo pole, and the flagpole.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The top of the bamboo pole, the top of the flagpole, and the observation point on the ground lie on a straight line.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Due to the similar triangles, the ratio of the heights is equal to the ratio of the distances from the observation point.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- I have identified the relevant information for solving the problem: the heights of the bamboo pole, the distance from the observation point to the pole, and the distance from the observation point to the flagpole. The relationship of similar triangles needs to be properly represented in predicates.
