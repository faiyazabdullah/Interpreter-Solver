PROBLEM 398 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A circle with a radius of $ \frac{1}{5} \mathrm{~cm}$. Find the area of the circle shown.

Give your answer as an exact value.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a circle and a line segment representing the radius.
- The radius is labeled as $\frac{1}{5}$ cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a clearly defined radius. The length of the radius is $\frac{1}{5}$ cm.
- Need to calculate the area. Area = $\pi r^2$.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles or perpendicularity are specifically marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The length of the radius is given as $\frac{1}{5}$ cm.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The radius connects the center of the circle to a point on the circumference.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Area of the circle is $\pi r^2$ where r is $\frac{1}{5}$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All relevant information is captured.
