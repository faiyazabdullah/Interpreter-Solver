PROBLEM 165 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In Rttriangle ABC, angle C = 90.0, AB = 2.0, BC = 1.0, then the value of sinB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC.
- Points A, B, and C are vertices of the triangle.
- Line segments AB, BC, and AC are the sides of the triangle.
- Angle C is a right angle.
- The length of AB is 2.0.
- The length of BC is 1.0.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle C is a right angle (90 degrees).
- Line AC is perpendicular to Line BC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal elements are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and BC intersect at point B.
- Lines AC and BC intersect at point C.
- Lines AB and AC intersect at point A.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- The Pythagorean theorem can be applied to find the length of AC: AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2.
- Trigonometric ratios can be applied to angles A and B.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information needed to define the triangle and its properties is captured.
- The right angle, side lengths, and triangle vertices are all represented.
