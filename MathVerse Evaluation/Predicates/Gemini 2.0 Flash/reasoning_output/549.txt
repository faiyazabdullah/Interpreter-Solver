PROBLEM 549 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Takoda is watching the tides off the coast of Cape Cod. For two days, Takoda records the height of the water, $h$, in feet. His results are shown in the graph below, where $t$ corresponds to the number of hours after 12:00 a.m. According to Takoda's research, approximately how much time passes between two consecutive high tides?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a periodic function. The axes are labeled $h$ and $t$.
- The graph appears to be sinusoidal.
- The graph oscillates between a maximum of approximately 4.25 and a minimum of approximately 0.
- The x-axis is labeled t, representing time. The y-axis is labeled h, representing height.
- The scale on the x-axis is in increments of 4.
- The scale on the y-axis is in increments of 1.

STEP 2: PERIOD ANALYSIS
- The graph completes a full cycle from approximately t=8 to t=20, so the period is approximately 12.
- The graph completes another full cycle from approximately t=20 to t=32, so the period is approximately 12.
- The graph completes another full cycle from approximately t=32 to t=44, so the period is approximately 12.
- The period is the time between two consecutive high tides or two consecutive low tides.

STEP 3: HIGH TIDE ANALYSIS
- The high tides occur at approximately t=4, t=16, t=28, and t=40. The time between these high tides is approximately 12 hours.

STEP 4: LOW TIDE ANALYSIS
- The low tides occur at approximately t=10, t=22, t=34, and t=46. The time between these low tides is approximately 12 hours.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph is a periodic function, with a period of approximately 12 hours.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The graph shows the height of the water as a function of time.
- The question asks for the time between two consecutive high tides.
- The time between two consecutive high tides is the period of the function, which is approximately 12 hours.
