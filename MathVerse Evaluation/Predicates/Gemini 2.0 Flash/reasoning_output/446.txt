PROBLEM 446 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\cos a$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at the origin of a coordinate system.
- A point P is located on the circle at coordinates (-21/29, 20/29).
- An angle 'a' is formed from the positive x-axis to the line connecting the origin to point P.
- The radius of the circle is 1.
- The x and y axes are shown.
- There is a line from the origin to P and a line from the origin to the x-axis intersection.
- We need to identify the geometric relationships and constraints

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The circle is centered at the origin (0,0).
- Point P (-21/29, 20/29) lies on the circle.
- The radius of the circle is 1.
- The line from the origin to P is a radius of the circle.
- The line segment along the x-axis from the origin to (1,0) is also a radius.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 'a' is in standard position, measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Both radii of the circle are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The origin is the intersection of the x and y axes.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The coordinates of point P define the cosine and sine of the angle 'a'.
- Since the radius of the circle is 1, the x-coordinate of P is equal to cos(a) and the y-coordinate of P is equal to sin(a).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to identify the value of cos(a).
- We know that the x-coordinate of point P is equal to cos(a).
