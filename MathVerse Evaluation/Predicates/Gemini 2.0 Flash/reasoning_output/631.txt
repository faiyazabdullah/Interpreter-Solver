PROBLEM 631 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=-5\sin x
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph of a sine function. The graph passes through the points (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). A maximum point is labeled on the function at (90,1). The x-axis ranges from approximately 0 to 360 degrees. The y-axis ranges from -1 to 1. The function appears to be symmetric about the origin. The equation given in the question is a transformation of this original function.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
Not applicable

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The graph has symmetry about the origin.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The graph intersects the x-axis at 0, 180, and 360 degrees. The graph intersects the y-axis at 0.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The graph is a sine function, implying periodic behavior and specific relationships between the points. The given equation y = -5sin x is a vertical stretch and reflection of the original sine function.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The analysis has identified the key features of the graph, including the points it passes through, its symmetry, and its relationship to the given function.
