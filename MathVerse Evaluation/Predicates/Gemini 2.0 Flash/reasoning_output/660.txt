Question: A cylinder has a surface area of 54105(mm)^2 and a radius of 79 mm.

What must the height $h$ mm of the cylinder be?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a cylinder. The cylinder has a radius of 79mm and a height of h mm. The surface area of the cylinder is given as 54105 mm^2.

STEP 2: CYLINDER SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula 2*pi*r^2 + 2*pi*r*h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The image shows a cylinder with radius 79mm and height h mm.
Surface area is given as 54105 mm^2.

STEP 3: EQUATION SETUP
2*pi*(79)^2 + 2*pi*(79)*h = 54105
2*pi*6241 + 158*pi*h = 54105
12482*pi + 158*pi*h = 54105
158*pi*h = 54105 - 12482*pi
h = (54105 - 12482*pi)/(158*pi)
h = (54105 - 39217.13)/(496.37)
h = 14887.87/496.37
h = 30
