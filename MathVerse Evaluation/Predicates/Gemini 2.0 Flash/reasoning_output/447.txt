PROBLEM 447 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(\frac{20}{29},-\frac{21}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\cos a$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.
- Point P lies on the circle, with coordinates (20/29, -21/29).
- A line segment connects the origin to point P, labeled as length 'a'.
- A line segment lies along the positive x-axis, from the origin to the point (1,0) on the circle.
- Angle 'a' is in standard position, formed by the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to point P.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The center of the circle is the origin (0,0).
- The radius of the circle is 1.
- Point P(20/29, -21/29) lies on the circle.
- The line segment from the origin to P is a radius.
- The point (1, 0) is on the circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 'a' is formed by the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to P.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is equal to 1.
- The length of the line segment connecting the origin to P is also equal to the radius of the circle (1).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The x-axis intersects the circle at (1, 0).
- Point P lies on the circle at (20/29, -21/29).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The x-coordinate of point P is equal to cos(a), and the y-coordinate is equal to sin(a).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image provides all the necessary information to determine cos(a).
