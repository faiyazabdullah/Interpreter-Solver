PROBLEM 152 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB is a fixed climbing ladder leaning on the wall, the distance from the foot of the ladder B to the foot of the wall C is 1.6, the distance from the point D on the ladder to the wall is 1.4, and the length of the ladder is 0.5, then the length of the ladder is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: The figure contains lines, segments, angles, and right triangles.
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: AB, BC, AC, DE
- Measurements: BC = 1.6, DE = 1.4, BD = 0.5
- Special markings: Right angle at C and E. Implied similarity between triangle ABC and triangle ADE.
- Implied constructions: Perpendiculars AC and DE to BC.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ACB and Angle DEB are right angles.
- Angle ABC is shared by triangle ABC.
- Angle ADE is shared by triangle ADE.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Triangle ABC is similar to triangle ADE.
- Angle ABC = Angle ADE.
- Angle BAC = Angle DAE.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point E lies on BC.
- Point D lies on AB.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since triangles ABC and ADE are similar, the ratio of their corresponding sides are equal, that is AB/DB = AC/DE = BC/BE.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All given and implied relationships are accounted for.
- The predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving.
