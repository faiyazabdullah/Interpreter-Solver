PROBLEM 591 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line passes (0,2), (1,0). What is the slope of the line?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a line in a coordinate plane.
- Points (0,2) and (1,0) are on the line.
- The coordinate plane has x and y axes.
- The grid lines are spaced at unit intervals.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable here.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the y-axis at (0,2).
- The line intersects the x-axis at (1,0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can find the slope of the line using the two points given. The slope is calculated as (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified two points on the line. This information is sufficient to determine the slope.
