PROBLEM 599 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows $y_1=x^3$ passing (0,0) and a vertical or horizontal translation $y_2$ passing (-2,0). The blue line is solid while the red line is dotted. Write an equation for $y_2$ as shown in the graph.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two curves. The first curve, $y_1 = x^3$, passes through the origin (0,0). It is represented by a solid blue line.
- The second curve, $y_2$, is a horizontal translation of $y_1$. It passes through the point (-2,0). It is represented by a dotted red line.
- The x-axis and y-axis are shown with labeled tick marks.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The dotted red line represents a translated version of the solid blue line.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The first curve passes through (0,0).
- The second curve passes through (-2,0).
- The two curves intersect.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since the second curve is a horizontal translation of the first curve, we can determine the translation by examining the x-intercepts of the two curves. The first curve has an x-intercept of 0, and the second curve has an x-intercept of -2.
- This means the second curve is a translation of the first curve by -2 units in the x direction.
- Therefore, the equation of the second curve is $y_2 = (x+2)^3$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the two curves, their relationship, and the necessary parameters for determining the equation of the second curve.
- The horizontal translation is identified.
