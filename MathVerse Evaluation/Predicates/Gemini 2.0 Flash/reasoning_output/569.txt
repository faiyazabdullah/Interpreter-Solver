PROBLEM 569 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two parabolas, f(x) and g(x), plotted on a coordinate plane. f(x) is in blue and has a vertex at (0,0). g(x) is in red and appears to be a translated version of f(x). The vertex of g(x) is at (0,-2). The function f is labelled. The function g is labelled. The coordinate plane ranges from -7 to 7 on the x-axis and -7 to 7 on the y-axis.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The axes of the coordinate plane are perpendicular. The parabolas are symmetric about the y-axis.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two parabolas have the same shape, suggesting they are congruent after a translation.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The vertex of f(x) is at the origin (0,0). The vertex of g(x) is at (0,-2).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
f(x) = x^2. g(x) appears to be a vertical translation of f(x) downwards by 2 units. Therefore, g(x) = x^2 - 2.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The analysis captures all essential information to describe the relationship between f(x) and g(x).
