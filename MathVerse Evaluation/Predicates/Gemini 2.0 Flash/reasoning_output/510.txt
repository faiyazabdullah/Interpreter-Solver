PROBLEM 510 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is -6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a coordinate plane with a line and a shaded region.
- The line intersects the x-axis at x=-3, so the x-intercept is -3.
- The line intersects the y-axis at y=-6, so the y-intercept is -6.
- The line is solid, indicating that the line itself is included in the solution.
- The region to the right of the line and above it is shaded, indicating that the points in that region satisfy the inequality.
- The equation of the line can be found using the two intercepts (-3,0) and (0,-6).

STEP 2: DERIVE THE LINE EQUATION
The slope of the line is (-6 - 0) / (0 - (-3)) = -6/3 = -2
Using the slope-intercept form, the equation of the line is y = -2x - 6
Since the region above the line is shaded, the inequality must be y >= -2x - 6
Alternatively, we can rewrite the equation as 2x + y >= -6
