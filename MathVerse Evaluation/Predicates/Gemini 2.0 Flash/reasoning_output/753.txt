PROBLEM 753 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure shown above, the rectangular container has length, width and height of 6, 5, and 4, and the cylinder has radius of 3. If all the water in the rectangular container is poured into the cylinder, the water level rises from $h$ inches to $(h+x)$ inches. Which of the following is the best approximation of the value of $x$ ?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes: The image shows a rectangular prism (container) and a cylinder.
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names: The rectangular container has length 6, width 5, and height 4. The cylinder has radius 3. The height of the water in the cylinder rises from h to h+x.
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values: Length = 6, Width = 5, Height = 4, Radius = 3.
- Identify ALL special markings: None
- Identify ALL implied constructions: None

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Identify the center and all points on the circle: Center of the cylinder's base circle is implied.
- Determine which lines are radii, chords, diameters, or tangents: Radius = 3.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Examine ALL angles shown in the diagram, both marked and unmarked: The rectangular container implies right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL equal lengths, angles, or shapes: The cylinder's cross sections are equal circles. The sides of the rectangular container imply pairs of equal lengths.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Determine where lines intersect and at what points: The sides of the rectangular prism intersect at vertices.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Combine observations to identify implicit relationships: The volume of the water in the rectangular container is equal to the volume of the water that rises in the cylinder.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured: All dimensions and geometric shapes are identified.
