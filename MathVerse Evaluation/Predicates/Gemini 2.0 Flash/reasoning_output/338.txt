PROBLEM 338 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure below, point B is due East of point A. We want to find the position of point A relative to point C. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 49° and angle B is 39°.

Find the true bearing of point A from point C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC with angles at A and B given as 49 and 39 degrees respectively.
- Point B is due East of Point A.
- There are arrows at points A, B, and C representing the compass directions.
- We need to find the bearing of A from C.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angles at A and B inside the triangle are given as 49 and 39 degrees respectively.
- We can find the angle at C inside the triangle as 180 - 49 - 39 = 92 degrees.
- The directions at points A, B, and C form right angles.

STEP 3: POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- B is due East of A.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- The directions (North, South, East, West) are perpendicular.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the necessary angles, points, and relationships.
