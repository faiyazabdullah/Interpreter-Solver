PROBLEM 019 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, a parallel b, angle 1 = 158.0, angle 2 = 42.0, angle 4 = 50.0. Then angle 3 = ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: Lines, angles.
- Points: Implicit intersection points where lines meet.
- Lines: Two parallel lines labeled 'a' and 'b', and two transversals that intersect both parallel lines.
- Angles: Angle 1 = 158 degrees, Angle 2 = 42 degrees, Angle 4 = 50 degrees, Angle 3 = unknown.
- Special markings: Parallel marks on lines 'a' and 'b'.
- Implied constructions: None

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 is an obtuse angle (158 degrees).
- Angle 2 is an acute angle (42 degrees).
- Angle 4 is an acute angle (50 degrees).
- Angle 3 is unknown, but visually appears to be acute.
- No explicit perpendicular relationships are indicated.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruence or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The transversals intersect parallel lines a and b.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Lines a and b are parallel. This implies alternate interior angles are equal, corresponding angles are equal, and same-side interior angles are supplementary.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information seems to be present to determine the value of angle 3 based on the properties of parallel lines cut by transversals.
