PROBLEM 339 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure below, point B is due East of point A. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 49° and angle B is 41°. Find the true bearing of point B from point A.
Choice:
A. 090^\circ T
B. 180^\circ T
C. 049^\circ T
D. 041^\circ T
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes: Points, lines, angles, and a triangle.
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names: Points A, B, C. The triangle is ABC. There are additional lines emanating from each point indicating direction.
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values: Angle at A is 49°, angle at B is 41°.
- Identify ALL special markings: Dashed lines indicate the sides of the triangle. The lines extending from A and B show that B is due east of A.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The lines extending from points A and B are perpendicular to the north-south direction. Since B is due East of A, the angle between the line segment AB and the north-south line from A is the true bearing of B from A. We are given that the angle at A in triangle ABC is 49°.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The problem states that point B is due East of point A. This means that the angle we're looking for is 090° T.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given diagram and problem statement provide enough information to determine the true bearing.
