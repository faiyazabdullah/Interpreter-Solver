PROBLEM 536 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows the graph of a trigonometric function.
- There is a minimum point at (-π/2, 2.4) and a maximum point at (3π/2, 13).
- The x-axis and y-axis are visible.
- Grid lines are present.

STEP 2: IDENTIFYING THE AMPLITUDE
The amplitude is half the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values.

STEP 3: PREDICATE GENERATION
