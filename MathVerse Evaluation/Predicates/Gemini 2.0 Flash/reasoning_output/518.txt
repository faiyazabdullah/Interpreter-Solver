PROBLEM 518 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph of $y=2^{x}$ is displayed here, whose y-intercept=1 and all values > 0. Which single option below gives us the graph's domain?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of the function y = 2^x.
- The axes are labeled x and y.
- The x-axis ranges from approximately -6 to 6.
- The y-axis ranges from approximately -7 to 7.
- The grid lines are present on the graph.
- The function appears to always be greater than 0.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as there are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph shows the exponential function y = 2^x, which has a y-intercept of 1.
- The function is always positive.
- As x approaches negative infinity, y approaches 0 but never reaches it.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The analysis identifies the key characteristics of the given exponential function.

Line(y)
Perpendicular(Line(x),Line(y))
Equals(Pow(2,x),y)
