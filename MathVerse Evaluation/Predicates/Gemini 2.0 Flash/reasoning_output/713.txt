PROBLEM 713 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the cone given. The radius is 9.1cm. The slant height is 13.7cm.

Give your answer correct to 2 decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cone.
- The slant height of the cone is given as 13.7 cm.
- The radius of the base is given as 9.1 cm.
- We need to find the surface area of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone is a circle.
- The radius of the circle is 9.1 cm.

STEP 3: CONE SURFACE AREA
- The surface area of a cone is given by the formula πr(r + l), where r is the radius and l is the slant height.
- We are given r = 9.1 cm and l = 13.7 cm.
- Plugging these values into the formula, we get π * 9.1 * (9.1 + 13.7) = π * 9.1 * 22.8 ≈ 651.93

STEP 4: FINAL CALCULATION
Surface area = π * 9.1 * (9.1 + 13.7) = 3.14159 * 9.1 * 22.8 = 651.926772 ≈ 651.93
