PROBLEM 785 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, a shaded polygon which has equal sides and equal angles is partially covered with a sheet of blank paper, only one quadrilateral is showing. If x + y = 80, how many sides does the polygon have?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see a polygon partially covered by a rectangular piece of paper. The visible part of the polygon is a quadrilateral.
- We are given two angles, x and y, formed by the sides of the polygon and the edge of the paper.
- We are given that x + y = 80.
- The polygon is said to have equal sides and equal angles. This implies it's a regular polygon.
- The polygon's sides intersect the paper at two distinct points.
- The shape is a polygon.
- Angles are marked with variables x and y.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We know the polygon is regular, so all interior angles are equal.
- The relationship x + y = 80 is given.
- The quadrilateral formed by the paper intersecting the regular polygon is not specified.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The polygon is regular, so all its sides are congruent, and all its interior angles are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides of the polygon intersect the edge of the paper.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since the polygon is regular, we know each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n, where n is the number of sides.
- The angles x and y are related to the interior angles of the polygon.
- The angles x and y are formed by the side of the polygon and the top edge of the paper.
- Let the interior angle of the regular polygon be A.
- The exterior angle at each vertex of the regular polygon will be supplementary to the interior angle.
- The sum x+y = 80

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the number of sides of the polygon. The regularity is critical, as is the x+y=80 constraint.
- The relationship between x, y, and the interior angles of the polygon is key.
