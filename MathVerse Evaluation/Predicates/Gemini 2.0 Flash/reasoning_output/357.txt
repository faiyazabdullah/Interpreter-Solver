PROBLEM 357 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The quadrilateral ABCD in the figure is composed of two right angled triangles ABC and ACD, angle B is 35Â°, angle BCD is a right angle, the length of BC is 13. Consider the following diagram:Find the size of \angle ACD.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD which is composed of two right triangles ABC and ACD.
- Points: A, B, C, D
- Lines: AB, BC, CA, AD, DC
- Angles: Angle ABC is 35 degrees. Angle BCA, CDA are right angles. Angle BCD is a right angle.
- Measurements: Length of BC is 13.
- Special Markings: Right angle symbols at angles BCA, CDA and BCD.
- Implied Constructions: AC is a common side to both triangles ABC and ACD.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is 35 degrees.
- Angle BCA is 90 degrees.
- Angle CDA is 90 degrees.
- Angle BCD is 90 degrees.
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with angle BCA being the right angle.
- Triangle ADC is a right triangle with angle CDA being the right angle.
- Line AC is perpendicular to line BC.
- Line AD is perpendicular to line CD.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or similar triangles are marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and BC intersect at point B.
- Lines BC and AC intersect at point C.
- Lines AC and AD intersect at point A.
- Lines AD and CD intersect at point D.
- Lines BC and CD intersect at point C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of angles in triangle ABC is 180 degrees, so angle BAC = 180 - 90 - 35 = 55 degrees.
- The sum of angles in quadrilateral ABCD is 360 degrees.
- Angle ACD = 90 - Angle BCA

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates capture all shapes, points, angles, lines, measurements, and relationships visible in the diagram.
