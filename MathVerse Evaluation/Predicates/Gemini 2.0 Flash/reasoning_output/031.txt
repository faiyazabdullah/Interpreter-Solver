PROBLEM 031 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the straight line a parallel b, the point B is on the straight line b, and AB perpendicular BC, angle 2 = 65.0, then the degree of angle 1 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see two parallel lines, a and b, a point B on line b, and a line segment BC.
- We are given that AB is perpendicular to BC, which means the angle ABC is a right angle.
- We are given that angle 2 measures 65 degrees.
- We are asked to find the measure of angle 1.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We have Angle 1, Angle 2, and Angle ABC.
- AB is perpendicular to BC, therefore Angle ABC is a right angle.
- Angle 2 is given as 65 degrees.
- We know that lines a and b are parallel.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- None apparent at first glance. Parallel lines will give us some equal angles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point B lies on line b.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Because lines a and b are parallel, the angle formed by line BC and line b at point B is supplementary to angle 2.
- The sum of Angle 2 and angle CB to line b equals 180.
- Then we can determine the angle between line segment BC and line b.
- We are given AB perpendicular to BC, therefore the angle between AB and BC is 90 degrees.
- Angle 1 is complementary to the angle between line segment BC and line b.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to define the relationship between the parallel lines, the perpendicular lines, and the angles.
