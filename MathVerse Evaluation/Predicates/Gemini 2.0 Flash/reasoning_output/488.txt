PROBLEM 488 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a curve goes through (-4,1), (-1,3), and (0,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a curve on a coordinate plane.
- Points on the curve include approximately (-4, 1), (-1, 3), (0, 0), (1.25, -1.5), and (2.5, 0).
- The curve has local maximum around x = -2 and a local minimum around x = 1.25.
- The curve increases from left to right starting around x = -4, reaches a local max around x = -2 and decreases, then it increases again from around x = 1.25.
- The function is decreasing from approximately x = -2 to x = 1.25, and increasing from approximately x = -4 to x = -2 and again from x = 1.25 onward.

STEP 2: ANALYSIS OF INCREASING/DECREASING INTERVALS
- Estimate intervals where the curve is increasing: approximately (-4, -2) and (1.25, infinity)
- Estimate intervals where the curve is decreasing: approximately (-2, 1.25)
