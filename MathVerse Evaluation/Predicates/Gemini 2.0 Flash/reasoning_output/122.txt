PROBLEM 122 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, a sector with a central angle of 120.0 and a radius of 6.0 encloses the side of a cone (the joints are ignored), then the height of the cone is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: A sector, a cone. The cone has a circular base.
- Lines: Radius of the sector, which is also the slant height of the cone.
- Angles: Central angle of the sector is 120 degrees.
- Measurements: The radius of the sector (slant height of the cone) is 6.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The sector is part of a circle with radius 6. The circumference of the base of the cone is equal to the arc length of the sector.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit perpendicular relationships are visible, but the height of the cone is perpendicular to the radius of the base of the cone.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
-  The radius of the sector is equal to the slant height of the cone.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The arc of the sector forms the circumference of the base of the cone.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.  Arc length = (central angle/360) * 2 * pi * radius.  Circumference of cone base = 2 * pi * r (where r is the base radius).  We have the radius of sector (slant height of cone) = 6.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the key relationships: the arc length of the sector equals the circumference of the cone's base. This relates the sector's radius and central angle to the cone's base radius.
- We need to find the cone's height. By Pythagorean theorem,  height^2 + base_radius^2 = slant_height^2
