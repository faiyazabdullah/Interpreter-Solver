PROBLEM 514 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows the temperature of a room after the heater has been turned on. What is the slope of the shown function that passes the point (0, 1)?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with two axes, labeled "time (minutes)" and "temperature (degrees celsius)".
- A line is drawn on the graph that passes the point (0, 1).
- We can identify two points on the line: approximately (0,1) and (20, 5.2). The slope calculation will be based on visually approximated coordinates.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The line on the graph represents a linear function showing the relationship between time and temperature.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image contains the necessary information to extract the slope of the line.
