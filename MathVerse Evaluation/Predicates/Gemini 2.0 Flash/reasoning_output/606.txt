PROBLEM 606 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What is the average rate of change?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with the x-axis representing "call length (minutes)" and the y-axis representing "call cost".
- There's a line on the graph.
- Two points on the line are highlighted: (10, 10) and (20, 19).
- The line starts approximately at the y-intercept (0,1).

STEP 2: AVERAGE RATE OF CHANGE
The average rate of change is the slope of the line. We can calculate it using the two points (10, 10) and (20, 19).

STEP 3: Calculate the slope.
Slope = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)
Slope = (19 - 10) / (20 - 10) = 9 / 10 = 0.9
