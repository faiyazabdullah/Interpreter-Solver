PROBLEM 541 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $(1,1.5)$ and an amplitude of 1.5. What is the midline equation of the function?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trigonometric function graphed on a coordinate plane.
- The axes are labeled x and y.
- The function appears to be sinusoidal.
- A point (1, 1.5) is marked on the graph.
- The grid lines are at integer values.
- The function has a minimum at x = 1.
- The amplitude is 1.5.
- We need to find the equation of the midline. Since the amplitude is 1.5 and the minimum is 1.5, the midline will be 1.5 + 1.5 = 3.
- The graph touches the minimum at (1, 1.5). The graph touches the maximum at y = 4.5.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable since there are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The grid lines indicate equal distances. The peaks of the function look equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes intersect at (0, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The minimum of the function is at (1, 1.5).
- The amplitude is 1.5.
- Midline equation = minimum + amplitude = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3. The midline is a horizontal line. Therefore the equation is y = 3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have captured the minimum point and the amplitude.
