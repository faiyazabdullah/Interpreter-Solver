PROBLEM 444 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\tan a$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Circle: There is a circle in the image.
- Points: There are several points in the image: P(-21/29, 20/29), the origin (center of circle), and a point on the positive x-axis where the circle intersects.
- Lines: There are line segments connecting the origin to P, and the origin to the point on the positive x-axis.
- Angles: There is an angle 'a' in standard position.
- The radius of the circle is 1.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: The circle is centered at the origin.
- Point on Circle: The point P(-21/29, 20/29) lies on the circle.
- Radius: The line segment from the origin to P is a radius. The line segment from the origin to the point on the positive x-axis is also a radius. The length of these radii is 1.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 'a': The angle 'a' is in standard position.
- No perpendicular relationships are immediately visible, but the coordinate axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radii are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The point P lies on the circle.
- The angle 'a' is formed by the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to P.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The coordinates of P can be used to find trigonometric ratios of angle 'a'.
- Since the circle is centered at the origin and has radius 1, it's the unit circle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the necessary information. We know the coordinates of a point on the unit circle, and we know it corresponds to the angle 'a'.
