PROBLEM 550 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Elena knows that Lea has a garden with an area of 100 square meters. She does not know the specific width, $w$, and length, $l$ of the garden. The graph below represents the widths that correspond to possible lengths of Lea's garden, which decreases when $w$ increases and goes through (5,20), (10,10), (20,5). As the possible width of Lea's garden increases, what does its possible length approach?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with two axes, labeled 'l' (length) and 'w' (width).
- The graph represents a curve.
- Three points on the curve are approximately (5, 20), (10, 10), and (20, 5).
- The area of Lea's garden is 100 square meters, which implies l * w = 100.
- As 'w' increases, 'l' decreases.
- The question asks about the value 'l' approaches as 'w' increases. From the graph, as w increases, l approaches 0.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes appear to be perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the garden is constant at 100, so l = 100/w. As w approaches infinity, l approaches 0.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates capture the relationship between length and width.
