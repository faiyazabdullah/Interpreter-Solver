PROBLEM 564 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function going through (0,7), (-4,7) with a vertex (-2,3). f(x)=4(x-5)^2+2. Which function has a greater minimum?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a graph of a quadratic function y = g(x).
- Points on the graph are approximately: (0,7), (-4,7), (-2,3) which appears to be the vertex.
- Another quadratic function f(x)=4(x-5)^2+2 is defined.
- The question asks to compare the minimum of the two functions.

STEP 2: QUADRATIC FUNCTION ANALYSIS
- g(x) is a quadratic function that passes through the points (0,7), (-4,7), and (-2,3). The vertex appears to be at (-2,3).
- f(x) is a quadratic function defined by f(x)=4(x-5)^2+2.
- The vertex form of a quadratic function is f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h,k) is the vertex. Thus, the vertex of f(x) is (5,2).

STEP 3: MINIMUM VALUE ANALYSIS
- The minimum value of g(x) is the y-coordinate of its vertex, which is 3.
- The minimum value of f(x) is the y-coordinate of its vertex, which is 2.

STEP 4: GREATER MINIMUM DETERMINATION
- Since 3 > 2, g(x) has a greater minimum value.

STEP 5: PREDICATE GENERATION

```
PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,7),Line(y,g(x)))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-4,7),Line(y,g(x)))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-2,3),Line(y,g(x)))
Equals(3,3)
Equals(7,7)
Equals(-4,-4)
Equals(-2,-2)
