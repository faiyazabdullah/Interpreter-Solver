Question: A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions. The height of the square pyramid is 5x+7. Length L is the side of the base of the pyramid.

Find an expression for L, in terms of the variable, x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a square pyramid.
- The height of the pyramid is labeled as 5x+7.
- The side of the square base is labeled as L.
- The height of the top pyramid is labeled as 2x+3.
- The side length of the top of the truncated pyramid is labeled 5.
- The total height of the pyramid is the sum of the height of the top pyramid and the height of the truncated pyramid.
- The height of the truncated pyramid is the difference between the total height of the pyramid and the height of the top pyramid.
- The height of the truncated pyramid is given by 5x+7 - (2x+3) = 3x+4
- The side of the top is 5. By similarity, L/5 = (5x+7)/(2x+3), thus L = 5(5x+7)/(2x+3)
- L/5 = (3x+4+2x+3)/(2x+3) => L/5 = (5x+7)/(2x+3), thus L = 5(5x+7)/(2x+3)

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No specific angles are marked as right angles, but it is assumed that the height is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable in this case.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable in this case.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height of the truncated pyramid + the height of the top pyramid = the total height of the pyramid.
- The ratio of the side length of the square base to the side length of the square top is equal to the ratio of the total height to the height of the top pyramid.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- I have listed all the information I need to define the expression for L.

PREDICATES:
Shape(Pyramid)
LengthOf(Height)=Add(5,Mul(5,x))
LengthOf(Side)=Add(3,Mul(2,x))
Equals(5x+7,Add(2x+3,3x+4))
LengthOf(Base)=Mul(LengthOf(Side),Div(5x+7,2x+3))
LengthOf(Base)=Mul(5,Div(5x+7,2x+3))
Equals(HeightOf(Pyramid),Add(Side,3x+4))
HeightOf(Pyramid)=5x+7
BaseOf(Pyramid)=L
IsSideOf(5,Square)
IsSideOf(L,Square)
LengthOf(5)=5
LengthOf(L)=L
LengthOf(Side)=2x+3
LengthOf(Base)=L
