PROBLEM 628 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

If the graph is translated 10 units up, what will be the coordinates of the new $y$-intercept?

State the coordinates in the form $(a, b)$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: The image shows a graph with a line representing a linear function.
- Points: Implied x-intercept (4,0) and y-intercept (0,4) from the equation $y=4-x$.
- Lines: The graph of the linear function $y=4-x$.
- Measurements: The equation of the line $y=4-x$ is given.
- Special markings: The x and y axes are labeled.
- Implied constructions: None.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as there are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Perpendicular relationship exists between the x and y axes.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The graph intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The equation of the line is $y = 4 - x$. Translating the line 10 units up changes the equation to $y = 4 - x + 10$, which simplifies to $y = 14 - x$. The y-intercept of this new line is (0, 14).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The analysis has captured the equation of the line and information to determine the y-intercept of the translated line.
