PROBLEM 610 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What is the average rate of change?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: The graph contains points, a line, and axes representing year and number of earthquakes.
- Points: There are 5 points on the line representing the number of earthquakes for years 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Lines: The x-axis represents "year" and the y-axis represents "number of earthquakes". There is a horizontal line connecting the points.
- Measurements: The y-axis is labeled from 0 to 10. The line is at y=6, so the number of earthquakes each year is 6. The x-axis represents years 1 to 4.
- Special markings: None
- Implied constructions: None

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes are perpendicular.
- The horizontal line connecting the points is perpendicular to the y-axis.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The number of earthquakes is constant at 6 for all years shown.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The points lie on the horizontal line.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The number of earthquakes remains constant over the years shown in the graph.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates capture the key information: number of earthquakes per year.
