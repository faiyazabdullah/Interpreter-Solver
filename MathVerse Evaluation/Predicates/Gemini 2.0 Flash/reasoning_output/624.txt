PROBLEM 624 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For the following exercises, use the graph in Figure 7, which shows the profit, y, in thousands of dollars, of a company in a given year, t, where t represents the number of years since 1980. The line chart is begin from (15,150) and goes to (25,130).

Find the linear function  y,  where  y  depends on  t,  the number of years since 1980.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a line segment on a coordinate plane.
- The x-axis is labeled as 't' and represents the number of years since 1980.
- The y-axis is labeled as 'y' and represents the profit in thousands of dollars.
- The line segment starts at the point (15, 150) and ends at the point (25, 130).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked angles.
- We can assume the axes are perpendicular, forming right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked congruent or equal shapes.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line segment connects the points (15, 150) and (25, 130).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The line segment represents a linear function y(t), where y is the profit and t is the number of years since 1980.
- The problem asks to find the linear function y(t). The line is defined by two points, therefore the slope can be calculated.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the necessary points, lines, and their relationships to describe the linear function.
