PROBLEM 060 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, if angle 2 = 135.0, then the degree of angle 1 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Lines, Angles.
- Points: A, B, C, D. Implicit intersection points.
- Measurements: Angle 2 = 135 degrees.
- Special markings: AB parallel to CD.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 2 is given as 135 degrees. Let's call the angle supplementary to angle 2 as angle 3.
- Since AB is parallel to CD, angle 1 and angle 3 are corresponding angles, so Angle 1 = Angle 3.
- Angle 2 and angle 3 are supplementary, so Angle 2 + Angle 3 = 180 degrees.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB parallel to CD.
- Angle 1 = Angle 3 (corresponding angles).

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect to form angles.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Parallel lines imply corresponding angles are equal.
- Supplementary angles add up to 180 degrees.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should capture that AB is parallel to CD, the measure of angle 2, and the relationship between angle 1 and angle 2.
- Make sure to define a point at the intersection.
