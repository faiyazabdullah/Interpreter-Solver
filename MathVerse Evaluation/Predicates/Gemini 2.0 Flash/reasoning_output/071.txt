PROBLEM 071 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the straight line AD parallel BC, if angle 1 = 42.0, angle BAC = 78.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes: We see lines, angles, and what appears to be a triangle formed by the intersecting lines.
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names: Points are A, B, C, D. Lines are AD, BC, AB, AC. Angles are labeled 1, 2, and BAC.
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values: Angle 1 = 42.0, Angle BAC = 78.0.
- Identify ALL special markings: Parallel lines AD and BC.
- Look for implied constructions: None immediately apparent.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS: No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS:
- Angle 1 is shown as 42 degrees. Angle BAC is shown as 78 degrees. Angle 2 is indicated. We can infer supplementary angles at point A where the lines intersect.
- No right angle indicators or explicitly marked perpendicular relationships are shown.
- No angle bisectors are marked.
- We can determine relationships between angles due to the parallel lines AD and BC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS:
- No equal lengths or angles are explicitly marked, aside from what's given (angle 1 = 42, angle BAC = 78)
- No congruent triangles or similar figures are marked directly.
- We can deduce angle equalities using parallel line properties (alternate interior, corresponding angles, etc.)

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS:
- Lines intersect at points A, B, and C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS:
- Parallel lines AD and BC provide constraints on the relationships between angles formed by the transversal lines AC and AB.
- The angle BAC is an interior angle to the lines AD and BC. Angle ACB is an alternate interior angle to angle CAD.
- Angle 1 (42 degrees) is formed between line BC and the transversal line AC.
- Angle 2 is formed at point A.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the shapes, points, angles, and given measurements.
- We have noted the key relationship of parallel lines, which will be crucial for solving the problem.
