PROBLEM 057 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB is parallel to CD, if angle B = 20.0, then angle C is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two lines AB and CD intersecting at a point (not labeled). AB is parallel to CD. Angle B is given as 20 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle C.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
We are given that angle B = 20 degrees. Since AB is parallel to CD, angle C and angle B are alternate interior angles and thus equal.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Since AB is parallel to CD, alternate interior angles are equal, so angle C = angle B.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines AB and CD intersect to form angles.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
AB is parallel to CD, therefore alternate interior angles are equal. Angle B is given as 20 degrees, hence angle C is also 20 degrees.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified the key relationship: AB || CD implies angle C = angle B.

STEP 7: Final Answer: The analysis is complete.
