PROBLEM 669 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the following hemisphere. The radius is 74.74 m,

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a hemisphere. A dashed line indicates the circular base. A vertical dashed line represents the radius, with a value of 74.74 m. The task is to calculate the surface area of the hemisphere.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The hemisphere has a circular base. The vertical dashed line, labeled 74.74 m, represents the radius of the hemisphere.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicit angles or perpendicularity markings. However, the radius is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The radius is 74.74 m

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The vertical radius intersects the circular base at its center.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The diagram provides the radius of the hemisphere, enabling the calculation of its surface area. Surface area of a hemisphere is 3*pi*r^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All necessary information (radius) is available.
