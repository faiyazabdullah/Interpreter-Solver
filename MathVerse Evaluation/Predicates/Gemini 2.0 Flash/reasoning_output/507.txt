PROBLEM 507 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Which of the following could be the equation of the graphed line, whose y-intercept is 3 and x-intercept is -8?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a line in a coordinate plane.
- The coordinate plane has an x-axis and a y-axis.
- The line intersects the y-axis at y = 3 (y-intercept is 3).
- The line intersects the x-axis at x = -8 (x-intercept is -8).
- No other shapes, angles, or specific markings are visible in the image.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruent or equal markings are given.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the x-axis at (-8, 0).
- The line intersects the y-axis at (0, 3).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The x-intercept is -8, meaning the line passes through the point (-8, 0).
- The y-intercept is 3, meaning the line passes through the point (0, 3).
- We can use these two points to determine the slope of the line, which is (3 - 0) / (0 - (-8)) = 3/8.
- The equation of the line is y = (3/8)x + 3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the x and y intercepts and can write the equation of the line.
