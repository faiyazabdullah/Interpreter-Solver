PROBLEM 643 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the cone shown. The perpendicular height is 6 centimeters and radius is 2 centimeters.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cone.
- We have a circle as the base of the cone.
- The height of the cone is perpendicular to the base.
- The radius of the base is 2 cm and the height of the cone is 6 cm.
- There's a right angle indicated at the intersection of the height and the radius.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The circle is the base of the cone.
- The radius is 2 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height is perpendicular to the base, so the angle between them is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruence or equality markings are shown.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The height intersects the base at the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The radius and height are perpendicular.
- The shape is a cone with a given radius and height.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the radius and height of the cone, which are needed to calculate its volume.
