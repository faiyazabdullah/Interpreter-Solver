PROBLEM 223 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a right triangle with the length of hypotenuse as 5 and other sides as x and 3 \sqrt { 2 }. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle.
- The sides of the triangle are labeled as x, $3\sqrt{2}$, and 5.
- The angle between sides x and $3\sqrt{2}$ is a right angle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, since there are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle indicated in the triangle.
- Therefore, the sides x and $3\sqrt{2}$ are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no congruence or equality markings in the image, other than the given side lengths.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides intersect to form the vertices of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since it is a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem applies.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is included for solving the problem.
