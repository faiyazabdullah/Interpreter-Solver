PROBLEM 114 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in the sector OAB with a radius of 1.0 and a central angle of 90.0, OA and OB are the diameters respectively as a semicircle, and the area of the shaded part in the figure is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Sector, Semicircles, Triangles, Shaded regions
- Points: O, A, B, Intersection of semicircle with OB, Intersection of semicircle with OA, Intersection of two semicircles.
- Lines: OA, OB, AB
- Measurements: OA = 1, Angle AOB = 90 degrees
- Markings: Right angle symbol at O
- Implied constructions: Semicircles with diameters OA and OB.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Two semicircles are present with diameters OA and OB respectively.
- OA and OB are radii of the sector OAB.
- Let C be the center of semicircle with diameter OA, and D be the center of semicircle with diameter OB. Thus OC = CA = OD = DB = 0.5
- Intersection point of the two semicircles is on the line AB

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AOB is a right angle.
- Angle OAB and OBA are 45 degrees in the triangle OAB.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB = 1
- Semicircle with diameter OA is congruent to semicircle with diameter OB.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two semicircles intersect at a point on AB
- Point A lies on semicircle with diameter OA
- Point B lies on semicircle with diameter OB

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the two segments (formed by chord AB and the two semicircles) are equal.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information required to define the shapes and their relationships are captured.
