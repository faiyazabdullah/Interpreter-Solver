PROBLEM 666 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the following sphere. The radius is 56.17 mm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle.
- A dashed circle is inside the larger circle.
- A line indicates the radius of the sphere is 56.17 mm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle.
- There is an indication of a 3D sphere with a dashed circle inside representing the back.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no specific angles marked in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Radius of the sphere is given as 56.17 mm.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line segment intersects the dashed circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The diagram shows a sphere with a given radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need the radius to calculate the surface area.
