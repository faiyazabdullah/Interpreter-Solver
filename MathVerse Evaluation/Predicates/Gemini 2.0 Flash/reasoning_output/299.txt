PROBLEM 299 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right isosceles triangle, the hypotenuse is 20. Find x. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle with sides labeled as x, x, and 20.
- There is a right angle marked in the triangle.
- Two sides of the triangle are equal in length (x), which implies that it is an isosceles triangle.
- Therefore, it is a right isosceles triangle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- One angle is a right angle.
- The triangle is a right triangle.
- The triangle is an isosceles triangle, so two angles are equal.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Two sides have the same length: x.
- The angles opposite those sides are also congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at the vertices of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The triangle is a right isosceles triangle.
- Pythagorean theorem applies: x^2 + x^2 = 20^2.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image contains the information needed to find x.
- The relationship is: right triangle + isosceles triangle + given hypotenuse = find side x.
