PROBLEM 509 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A line is parallel to x-axis at y=5. Write the inequality that describes the points in the shaded region.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a coordinate plane with x and y axes. A horizontal line is present at y=5. The region below the line y=5 is shaded. There are no explicit points labeled in the image.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular to each other. The line at y=5 is parallel to the x-axis and therefore perpendicular to the y-axis.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The shaded region represents all points where the y-coordinate is less than or equal to 5. The equation of the line is y = 5. The shaded region corresponds to the inequality y <= 5.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The question asks for the inequality that represents the shaded region. The analysis indicates that the shaded region contains all points with y-coordinate less than or equal to 5.
