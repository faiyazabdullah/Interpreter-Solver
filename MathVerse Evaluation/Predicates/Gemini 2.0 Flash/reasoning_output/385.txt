PROBLEM 385 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 30^\circ, one leg measuring \sqrt{10}.Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the exact value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a right-angled triangle.
- One of the acute angles is 30 degrees.
- The hypotenuse has length sqrt(10).
- One leg has length x.
- The right angle is indicated by a square.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We have a right angle.
- One angle is 30 degrees, so the other acute angle is 60 degrees.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruences are explicitly marked.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometric relationships in the right triangle to solve for x.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information needed to solve for x.
