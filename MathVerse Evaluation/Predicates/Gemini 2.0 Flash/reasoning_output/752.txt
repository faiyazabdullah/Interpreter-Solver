Question: The figure above shows a triangular prism whose base is a equilateral triangle with side lengths $x$ and height $\sqrt{3} x$. If the volume of the prism is $\frac{81}{4}$, what is the value of $x$ ?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a triangular prism. The base of the prism is an equilateral triangle with side length $x$. The height of the equilateral triangle is not explicitly given, but it's implied that the horizontal line of length $\sqrt{3}x$ shown dashed is the height of the triangular base, if it's taken as the "base". Also, one side of the prism appears to be a square with side length x. We need to find the value of $x$ if the volume of the prism is $\frac{81}{4}$. The dashed lines indicate hidden lines.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Since the base is an equilateral triangle, all the angles are 60 degrees. Also we can assume the prism has faces that are perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The equilateral triangle has all sides equal to $x$. One of the faces of the prism is a square with side length $x$.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The lines intersect at vertices of the shapes.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The area of the equilateral triangle is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}x^2$. Volume of prism is the area of base * height = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}x^2 * x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}x^3$. We are given that the volume is $\frac{81}{4}$. This means $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}x^3 = \frac{81}{4}$. So, $x^3 = \frac{81}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{81\sqrt{3}}{3} = 27\sqrt{3}$. This doesn't look right.
The height of the triangle is $\sqrt{3} x$. It is an equilateral triangle.
The length of the prism is x.
Area of the triangle = $\frac{1}{2} * x * \sqrt{3} x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2$.
Volume of prism = $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^2 * x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x^3 = \frac{81}{4}$
$x^3 = \frac{81 * 2}{4 * \sqrt{3}} = \frac{81}{2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{81\sqrt{3}}{6} = \frac{27\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
