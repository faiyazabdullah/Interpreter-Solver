PROBLEM 317 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot F, B, C, D, A are on the circle and A C is a diameter. \angle C F D is 4 a - 1 degrees. Find the measure of \angle A F B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle with center F. Points A, B, C, and D lie on the circumference of the circle. AC is a diameter. We are given the measures of angles CFD and AFB, denoted as (4a-1) degrees and 72 degrees, respectively. We also know the measure of angle AFD is (2a-5) degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
Point F is the center of the circle. Segments FA, FB, FC, and FD are radii of the circle, and therefore FA = FB = FC = FD. AC is a diameter. Points A, B, C, D are on the circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angles CFD, AFB, and AFD are given. Angle AFC is a straight angle since AC is a diameter. Therefore, the sum of angles AFB, BFC, and CFD equals 180 degrees if B lies between A and C, or the sum of angles AFD and DFC equals 180 if D lies between A and C. Since AC is a diameter, \angle AFC = 180 degrees. We also know that \angle AFC is composed of \angle AFB and \angle BFC, so \angle AFB + \angle BFC = 180, as well as that \angle AFC is composed of \angle AFD and \angle DFC so \angle AFD + \angle DFC = 180.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
FA = FB = FC = FD (radii of the same circle).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The segments intersect at point F, which is the center of the circle. A, B, C, and D lie on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since AC is a diameter, angle AFC is 180 degrees. Angles AFD and DFC form angle AFC. Angle AFD is (2a-5) and Angle DFC is (4a-1).
Angle AFB + Angle BFC = 180.
Angle AFB and angle BFC are supplementary. Also angles AFD and CFD are supplementary.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified the relationships needed to solve the problem, namely that the angles around point F add up to 360 degrees.
