PROBLEM 292 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right triangle, an acute angle is 70 degrees and the hypotenuse is x length. Find x to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle.
- One angle is labeled as 70 degrees.
- One side is labeled as 15.
- The hypotenuse is labeled as x.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- One angle is 70 degrees.
- One angle is a right angle (90 degrees).
- The third angle can be calculated as 180 - 90 - 70 = 20 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal shapes are directly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides of the triangle intersect at the vertices.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We have a right triangle.
- We can use trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) to relate the angle, sides, and hypotenuse.
- Since we know the angle and the adjacent side to that angle, we can use the cosine function: cos(70) = 15/x
- Solving for x, we have x = 15 / cos(70)

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the right triangle.
- We have labeled the angle and the side.
- We have set up the trigonometric ratio.
