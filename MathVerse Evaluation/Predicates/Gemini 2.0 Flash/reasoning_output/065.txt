PROBLEM 065 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, angle 1 = angle 2, angle 4 = 30.0, then angle 3 is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two parallel lines, labeled 'a' and 'b'. Two other lines, 'c' and 'd', intersect these parallel lines. Several angles are formed at the intersections. Angle 1 is formed by lines 'a' and 'd'. Angle 2 is formed by lines 'b' and 'd'. Angle 3 is formed by lines 'a' and 'c'. Angle 4 is formed by lines 'b' and 'c', and its measure is given as 30 degrees. The problem states that angle 1 is equal to angle 2.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
We know that angle 4 = 30 degrees. Also, angle 1 = angle 2. Since line 'a' and 'b' are parallel, angle 3 and angle 4 are corresponding angles, and angle 2 and its vertically opposite angle form a corresponding angle with angle 1.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
We are given that angle 1 = angle 2.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines 'a' and 'c' intersect. Lines 'a' and 'd' intersect. Lines 'b' and 'c' intersect. Lines 'b' and 'd' intersect.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since line 'a' and 'b' are parallel, corresponding angles are equal. Also, vertically opposite angles are equal.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates generated should capture all the given information and relationships between the angles.
