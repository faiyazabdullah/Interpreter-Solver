PROBLEM 069 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the straight line a parallel b, angle 2 = 35.0, angle 3 = 40.0, then the degree of angle 1 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have two parallel lines a and b.
- There is a transversal intersecting these lines.
- Several angles are formed. Angle 2 is 35 degrees and angle 3 is 40 degrees. We want to find angle 1.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We see angles 1, 2, and 3.
- The measure of angle 2 is 35.
- The measure of angle 3 is 40.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Line a is parallel to line b.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- We have intersections of lines.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since lines a and b are parallel, the angle vertically opposite to angle 1 is equal to the sum of angle 2 and angle 3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information needed.
