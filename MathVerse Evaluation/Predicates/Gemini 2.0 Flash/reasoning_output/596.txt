PROBLEM 596 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line passes (-2,-6) and (2,-3). Write an equation that represents the line.
Use exact numbers.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a line in a coordinate plane. Two points are marked on the line: (-2,-6) and (2,-3). The question asks for the equation of the line.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
No angles are explicitly marked, and no perpendicular relationships are directly indicated in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruence or equality relationships are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The line passes through the points (-2, -6) and (2, -3).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The slope of the line can be calculated using the two points: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (-3 - (-6)) / (2 - (-2)) = 3 / 4. Using point-slope form with point (2, -3): y - (-3) = (3/4)(x - 2) => y + 3 = (3/4)x - (3/2) => y = (3/4)x - (3/2) - 3 => y = (3/4)x - (9/2)

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified the points and the fact that they lie on a line. The slope is 3/4 and y-intercept is -9/2.

PREDICATES:
Point(A)
Point(B)
Line(A,B)
PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(A,B))
PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(A,B))
Equals(A,(-2,-6))
