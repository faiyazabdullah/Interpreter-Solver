PROBLEM 349 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Considering the diagram below, ABCD is a rectangle, find x, the angle of depression from point B to point C. The lengths of AC and BC are 3 and 5, respectively.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a rectangle ABCD.
- The given lengths are AC = 3 and BC = 5.
- There is a right angle at vertex A, B, and D.
- Angle x is marked, and Angle y is marked.
- It appears there is a line segment from B to C, with length 5.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BAC is a right angle.
- Angle BDA is a right angle.
- Angle ABC is a right angle.
- Angle BCD is a right angle.
- Angle x + angle y = 90 degrees.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB = CD, and AD = BC.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and AC intersect at A.
- Lines BC and CD intersect at C.
- Lines AD and CD intersect at D.
- Lines AD and AB intersect at A.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We are given that AC = 3, BC = 5.
- ABCD is a rectangle, implying right angles at vertices A, B, C, D.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the rectangle, lengths of AC and BC. We can find the length of AB using the Pythagorean theorem.
- We need to use the given information to find angle x. Angle x is the angle of depression from B to C.
- Since ABCD is a rectangle, BD is parallel to AC. Therefore, angle x is equal to angle ACB.
