PROBLEM 041 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The positions of straight lines a, b, c, and d are shown in the figure. If angle 1 = 100.0, angle 2 = 100.0, angle 3 = 125.0, then angle 4 is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Lines, angles
- Points: Not explicitly labeled, but can be inferred at intersections
- Lines: a, b, c, d
- Angles: Angle 1 = 100, Angle 2 = 100, Angle 3 = 125, Angle 4 = ?
- Special markings: None explicitly marked, but the figure suggests lines a and b might be parallel.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 and Angle 2 are supplementary to angles adjacent to them.
- Angle 3 and Angle 4 are supplementary to angles adjacent to them.
- We need to determine if a and b are parallel. Since Angle 1 = Angle 2, and they are in corresponding positions if a and b are cut by line c, this suggests that a and b are parallel.

STEP 3: PARALLEL LINES ANALYSIS
- If lines a and b are parallel, then corresponding angles are equal.
- Angles 1 and 2 are equal, and they are formed by the transversal c. Therefore lines a and b are parallel.
- If lines a and b are parallel, alternate interior angles are equal.
- If lines a and b are parallel, same-side interior angles are supplementary. This relationship will likely be needed to find Angle 4.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Angle 3 and an interior angle on line b are same-side interior angles and therefore supplementary. This interior angle is Angle 4.
- MeasureOf(Angle3) + MeasureOf(Angle4) = 180

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the relationship between Angle 3 and Angle 4, based on whether lines a and b are parallel. Since Angle 1 and Angle 2 are equal, lines a and b are parallel, and angles 3 and 4 are supplementary.
