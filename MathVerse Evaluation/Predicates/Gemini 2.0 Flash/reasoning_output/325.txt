PROBLEM 325 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the parallelogram with 2sides of 13yd and 10yd respectively. Find the area of the parallelogram. Round to the nearest tenth if necessary.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parallelogram with two sides of length 13 yd and 10 yd.
- One of the angles is given as 45 degrees.
- There is a dashed line representing the height of the parallelogram, which is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle between the base and the side of length 10 yd is 45 degrees.
- The dashed line indicates a right angle (90 degrees) with the base.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Opposite sides of the parallelogram are equal in length.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The height is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometry to find the height of the parallelogram using the given angle and side length.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the parallelogram, side lengths, an angle, and the height.
- We need to find the area of the parallelogram, which requires the base and height.

STEP 7: DERIVING HEIGHT
- Using the right triangle formed by the height, the 10yd side, and a portion of the base, and given the 45-degree angle, we have:
  sin(45) = height / 10yd
  height = 10yd * sin(45)
