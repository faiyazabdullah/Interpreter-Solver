PROBLEM 270 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Several triangles are combined together with 6 annotated angles. Find m \angle 6.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a combination of triangles. Some right angles are indicated. There are 6 labeled angles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The values of some angles are given: 25 degrees, 51 degrees, 35 degrees, and 28 degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are several right angles indicated by the square symbol. The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. Angles 1 and 2 form a right angle. The angles adjacent to angle 5 and angle 6 are right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked congruent triangles or equal lengths in the diagram.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines intersect at various points.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
We can determine relationships between the angles based on triangle angle sums and right angles. Angle 2 and angle 5 can be calculated using complementary angles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have captured all the information needed to find the value of angle 6.
