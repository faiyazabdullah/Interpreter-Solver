PROBLEM 558 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: h is a piecewise function, and goes through (-5,4), (3,3), (0,7), (3,1), (5,-5). What is the domain of h?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a piecewise function h.
- The function passes through the points (-5, 4), (-3, 3), (0, 7), (3, 1), and (5, -5).
- The x-axis ranges from -7 to 7.
- The y-axis ranges from -7 to 7.
- The function is defined between x = -5 and x = 5.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as there are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as there are no explicit angles or perpendicular relationships indicated.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, as there is no congruence or equality indicated.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The points (-5, 4), (-3, 3), (0, 7), (3, 1), and (5, -5) are on the piecewise function h.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The function h is a piecewise function defined between x = -5 and x = 5.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The domain of h is the interval [-5, 5].
- We have all the points that define the function and can represent it.
