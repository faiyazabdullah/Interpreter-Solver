PROBLEM 673 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: We wish to find the surface area of the shape given, consisting of a hemisphere and a cylinder. The radius is 10.55 mm. The height of cylinder is 33.1 mm.

Hence find the total surface area of the shape, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a composite shape consisting of a cylinder and a hemisphere.
- Cylinder: The cylinder has a height and a circular base.
- Hemisphere: The hemisphere sits on top of the cylinder, sharing the same radius.
- Measurements: The diameter of the base of the cylinder is 10.5 mm. The height of the cylinder is 33.1 mm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cylinder and the base of the hemisphere form circles.
- The radius of both circles is half of the diameter, which is 10.5 mm / 2 = 5.25 mm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the hemisphere is equal to the radius of the cylinder's base.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The hemisphere sits on top of the cylinder such that the base of hemisphere and top of cylinder are same.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The diameter of the cylinder is given, which allows us to calculate the radius. The radius is also the radius of the hemisphere.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the radius and height, which are necessary for calculating the surface area of the cylinder and hemisphere.
