PROBLEM 730 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the height of the triangular prism is 8cm and the length of its right triangle's sides are 2cm and 4cm respectively. Find the volume of the triangular prism.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see a triangular prism. It is composed of a right triangle and a rectangle.
- The right triangle has legs of length 2 cm and 4 cm.
- The height of the prism (length of the rectangle) is 8 cm.
- A right angle is marked in the triangle.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We see a right angle in the right triangle.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent relationships are immediately obvious.

STEP 4: MEASUREMENTS ANALYSIS
- Length of one leg of the right triangle: 2 cm
- Length of the other leg of the right triangle: 4 cm
- Height of the triangular prism: 8 cm

STEP 5: SHAPE IDENTIFICATION
- Right triangle
- Rectangle

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The legs of the right triangle are perpendicular.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the volume of the prism. We have base and height of the triangle and the length of the prism.
