PROBLEM 618 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the graph, where it is an exponential function and passes through (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), and (3,8), shown.

Which of the following relationships could be represented by the given graph?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a curve in a coordinate system.
- The x-axis and y-axis are labeled.
- The curve appears to be exponential.
- The curve passes through the points (0,1), (1,2), (2,4), and (3,8).

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The scale on each axis is such that each unit length is equal to the next.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The axes intersect at the origin.
- Several points are given on the curve.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The curve represents an exponential function of the form y = 2^x.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should accurately represent the image and the given information about the curve.

PREDICATES:
PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,1),Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(1,2),Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(2,4),Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(3,8),Line(x,y))
Perpendicular(Line(x),Line(y))
