PROBLEM 129 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the picture, the length of the generatrix of the cone-shaped tent roof is AB = 10.0, the bottom radius is BO = 5.0, and the lateral area of ​​the cone-shaped tent roof (excluding the seams) is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cone with vertex A and base circle centered at O.
- Points labeled are A, B, O, and C.
- Line AB has a length of 10.0.
- Line BO has a length of 5.0.
- Angle ABO is not explicitly a right angle, but AO is presented vertically, and BO is horizontal. Thus, angle AOB is a right angle, and line AO is the height of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle(O) is present.
- B and C lie on the circle.
- BO and OC are radii of the circle.
- BC is a diameter of the circle.
- The cone is formed by rotating right triangle AOB around the axis AO.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AOB is a right angle.
- Perpendicular(Line(A,O), Line(B,C))
- Implicitly, angle AOC is also a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- BO = OC since both are radii of the same circle.
- LengthOf(BO) = 5.0
- LengthOf(OC) = 5.0
- LengthOf(AB) = 10.0

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line AO intersects Line BC at point O.
- Point O lies on line BC.
- Point B lies on Circle(O)
- Point C lies on Circle(O)

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- A cone is formed by rotating a right triangle around one of its legs.
- The lateral surface area of a cone is πrl, where r is the radius and l is the slant height.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is present to determine the lateral surface area of the cone.
- All relationships between the elements of the cone are identified.
- Missing geometric properties are not identified.
