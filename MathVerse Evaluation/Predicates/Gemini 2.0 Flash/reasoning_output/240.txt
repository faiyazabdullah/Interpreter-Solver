PROBLEM 240 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the value of the variable y in the right trapezoid.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides, indicating a trapezoid.
- There are four angles: 120 degrees, x degrees, (3y+40) degrees, and (3x-70) degrees.
- The parallel sides are marked with arrows.
- The angle marked 120 degrees and the angle marked (3y+40) are supplementary, because the other angles are equal to x and 3x-70, and the trapezoid is a right trapezoid.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The two parallel lines, when extended, create supplementary angles with the transversal lines.
- The angles (3y+40) and 120 are supplementary angles since the figure shows a trapezoid with only one pair of parallel sides.
- The angles labeled x and (3x-70) are supplementary angles.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Parallel lines are marked.
- Supplementary angles can be found and set equal to 180 degrees.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- A trapezoid with one pair of parallel sides.
- Supplementary angle relationships.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All angles and parallel sides have been noted.

STEP 6: FIND THE VALUE OF Y
(3y + 40) + 120 = 180
3y + 160 = 180
3y = 20
y = 20/3

Predicates:
Quadrilateral(A,B,C,D)
MeasureOf(Angle(A),120)
MeasureOf(Angle(B),3y+40)
MeasureOf(Angle(C),x)
MeasureOf(Angle(D),3x-70)
Parallel(Line(A,B),Line(C,D))
Add(MeasureOf(Angle(A)),MeasureOf(Angle(B)),180)
Add(MeasureOf(Angle(C)),MeasureOf(Angle(D)),180)
Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(A)),MeasureOf(Angle(B))),180)
Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(C)),MeasureOf(Angle(D))),180)
