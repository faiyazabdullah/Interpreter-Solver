PROBLEM 034 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the straight lines AB and CD are intercepted by the straight line EF. If AB parallel CD, angle 1 = 100.0, then the size of angle 2 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two lines AB and CD intersected by a transversal EF.
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Lines: AB, CD, EF
- Angles: Angle 1, Angle 2, an angle supplementary to angle 1.
- Measurement: Angle 1 = 100 degrees.
- Parallel lines: AB || CD.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 and its adjacent angle are supplementary.
- Angle 2 and the corresponding angle to angle 1 are supplementary since AB || CD.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB is parallel to CD.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- EF intersects AB.
- EF intersects CD.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- If AB || CD, then alternate interior angles are equal and corresponding angles are equal, consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The problem states AB || CD and measure of Angle 1. We want to determine the measure of Angle 2. The predicates must reflect this.
