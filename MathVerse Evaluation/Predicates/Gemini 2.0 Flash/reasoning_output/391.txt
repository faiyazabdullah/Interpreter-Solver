PROBLEM 391 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A circle with a circumference of $42 \mathrm{~cm}$. Consider the circle below.

What is the diameter $D$ of the circle?

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a circle.
- The circumference of the circle is given as 42 m.
- The question asks for the diameter D of the circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The diagram shows a circle with its circumference labeled as 42 m.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The circumference of a circle is related to its diameter by the formula $C = \pi D$.
- We are given the circumference $C = 42 \mathrm{~m}$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the circumference and we need to find the diameter. The formula $C = \pi D$ relates these two quantities.
