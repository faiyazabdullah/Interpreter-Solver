PROBLEM 109 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, it is known that angle α = 130.0, then angle β = ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle.
- One angle of the triangle is a right angle.
- There is a line intersecting the triangle.
- Angle α is 130 degrees.
- Angle β is an unknown angle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- One angle is a right angle, i.e., 90 degrees.
- Angle α and its adjacent angle form a linear pair, thus supplementary angles.
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit markings for equal lengths or angles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects two sides of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Supplementary angles sum to 180 degrees.
- Angles in a triangle sum to 180 degrees.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information appears to be captured.
