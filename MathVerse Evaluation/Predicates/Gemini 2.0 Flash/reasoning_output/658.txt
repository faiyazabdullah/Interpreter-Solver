PROBLEM 658 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diagram shows a water trough in the shape of a half cylinder. The height is 2.49 m and radius is 0.92 m.

Find the surface area of the outside of this water trough.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a half-cylinder water trough.
- The length of the trough is given as 2.49 m.
- The height is given as 0.92 m, which is also the radius of the semi-circular ends.
- The surface area to be calculated consists of the curved surface of the half-cylinder and the rectangular base.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the semicircle is 0.92 m.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The flat base of the trough is perpendicular to the semi-circular ends.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two semi-circular ends are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The curved surface and the rectangular base join at the edges of the semi-circular ends.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Surface area of the curved part = 1/2 * (2 * pi * r) * length = pi * r * length
- Area of the rectangular base = 2r * length
- Total surface area = pi * r * length + 2r * length
- Given values: r = 0.92 m, length = 2.49 m

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the required information and relationships are captured.
