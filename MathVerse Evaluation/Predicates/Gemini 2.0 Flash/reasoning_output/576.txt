PROBLEM 576 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A polynomial function p is graphed, which goes through (-5,0), (-1.5,0), (2,0). What could be the equation of p?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a polynomial function p.
- The function p intersects the x-axis at three points: (-5, 0), approximately (-1.5, 0), and (2, 0).
- There is a local maximum between x = -5 and x = -1.5.
- There is a local minimum between x = -1.5 and x = 2.
- The function increases as x goes to positive infinity and decreases as x goes to negative infinity.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked congruent or equal elements.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The function p intersects the x-axis at (-5,0), (-1.5,0), and (2,0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph represents a polynomial function.
- The points where the graph intersects the x-axis are the roots of the polynomial function. Since there are three intersections with the x-axis, this is at least a cubic polynomial.
- Based on the end behavior, the function is likely a cubic function with a positive leading coefficient.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates need to state the function type and the x-intercepts.
