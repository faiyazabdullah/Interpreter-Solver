PROBLEM 498 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a curve goes through (-2,0), (0,0), (2,0). Use the vertical line test to determine if this relation is a function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a curve plotted on a coordinate plane with x and y axes. The curve intersects the x-axis at three points: (-2, 0), (0, 0), and (2, 0). The curve rises and falls, indicating that the function might be a polynomial. The question asks about whether this graph is a function.

STEP 2: VERTICAL LINE TEST
To determine if the relation is a function, the vertical line test must be performed. If a vertical line drawn anywhere on the graph intersects the curve at more than one point, then the curve does not represent a function. Visually, it is clear that a vertical line will only intersect the curve at one point at any given x-value.

STEP 3: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The question asks us to determine if the given relationship represents a function, so the vertical line test is required.
