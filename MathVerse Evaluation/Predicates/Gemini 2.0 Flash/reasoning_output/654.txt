PROBLEM 654 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the following hemisphere. The radius is 25.36 centimeters.

Round your answer to three decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a hemisphere.
- The radius of the hemisphere is given as 25.36 cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the hemisphere is a circle.
- The radius of the circle is 25.36 cm.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of a hemisphere is (2/3) * pi * r^3.
- We are given the radius, r = 25.36 cm.
