PROBLEM 281 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right trangle A B C, \angle C = 90 degrees. A C = 24, A B = 26, and B C = 10. Express the ratio of \cos B as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC.
- Points: A, B, C.
- Lines: Line(A, C), Line(A, B), Line(B, C).
- Angle at C is a right angle.
- Length of AC = 24.
- Length of AB = 26.
- Length of BC = 10.
- The triangle is a right triangle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle C is a right angle, so Line(A, C) is perpendicular to Line(B, C).

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or similar figures are explicitly shown.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at points A, B, and C, forming the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- The lengths of the sides are given.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information provided is sufficient to calculate the cosine of angle B.
