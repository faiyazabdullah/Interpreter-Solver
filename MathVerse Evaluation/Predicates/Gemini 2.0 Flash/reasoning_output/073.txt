PROBLEM 073 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, triangle ABC is the inscribed triangle of circle O. If angle ABC = 70.0, then the degree of angle AOC is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle with center O. Triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle. Angle ABC is given as 70 degrees. I need to find the measure of angle AOC.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
Point O is the center of the circle. Points A, B, and C lie on the circle. Line segments OA, OB, and OC are radii of the circle. Angle AOC is a central angle. Angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle ABC is an inscribed angle that measures 70 degrees. The central angle AOC subtends the same arc AC. According to the inscribed angle theorem, the central angle is twice the measure of the inscribed angle when they both subtend the same arc.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
OA = OB = OC as they are radii of the same circle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Points A, B, and C lie on the circle. Point O is the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The measure of central angle AOC is twice the measure of inscribed angle ABC.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
I have identified all the relevant geometric shapes, points, angles, and relationships. I can now define the predicates.
