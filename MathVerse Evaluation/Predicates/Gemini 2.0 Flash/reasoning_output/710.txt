PROBLEM 710 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the cone shown. The radius is 3cm. The slant height is 10cm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cone.
- The cone has a circular base with a radius of 3 cm.
- The slant height of the cone is 10 cm.
- No angles are explicitly marked.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone is a circle.
- The radius of the circle is 3 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cone is perpendicular to the base at the center of the circular base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruence or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The apex of the cone is positioned directly above the center of the circular base.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The slant height, radius, and height form a right triangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image provides enough information to compute the surface area of the cone.
- Radius of base and slant height are provided.
