PROBLEM 741 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A cylinder has a surface area of 54105 \mathrm{mm}^2 and a radius of 79 mm.

What must the height h mm of the cylinder be?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cylinder.
- The cylinder has a radius of 79 mm.
- The height of the cylinder is labeled as h mm.
- The surface area of the cylinder is 54105 \mathrm{mm}^2.

STEP 2: CYLINDER PROPERTIES
- The cylinder is composed of two circles and a rectangle.
- The circles are at the top and bottom of the cylinder.
- The rectangle wraps around the two circles.

STEP 3: SURFACE AREA
- The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula: 2*pi*r^2 + 2*pi*r*h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
- In this case, the surface area is 54105 \mathrm{mm}^2 and the radius is 79 mm.

STEP 4: VARIABLE IDENTIFICATION
- We are given the radius r = 79 mm.
- We are given the surface area = 54105 \mathrm{mm}^2.
- We need to find the height h.

STEP 5: EQUATION SETUP
- 54105 = 2*pi*(79)^2 + 2*pi*79*h
- 54105 = 2*pi*6241 + 158*pi*h
- 54105 = 12482*pi + 158*pi*h

STEP 6: HEIGHT CALCULATION
- 54105 - 12482*pi = 158*pi*h
- h = (54105 - 12482*pi) / (158*pi)
