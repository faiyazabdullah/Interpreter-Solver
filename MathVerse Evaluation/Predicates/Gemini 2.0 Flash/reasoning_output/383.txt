PROBLEM 383 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, one leg measuring \sqrt{3}. Find the length of side x, leaving your answer as an exact value.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a right-angled triangle.
- One angle is given as 60 degrees, another as 30 degrees.
- One side (leg) is given as sqrt(3).
- The hypotenuse is labeled as 'x'.
- There's a right angle indicator at one vertex.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle has a right angle.
- The other two angles are 30 and 60 degrees, which are complementary.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or similar figures are explicitly marked.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides intersect to form the vertices of the triangle.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometric ratios to relate the sides and angles.
- The triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the angle measures and one side length.
- We need to find the length of the hypotenuse.

STEP 7: ANGLE PROPERTY ANALYSIS
- Let the triangle be ABC, where angle A = 90, angle B = 60, and angle C = 30.
- The side opposite to angle C is sqrt(3).
- So, AB = sqrt(3).
- We can use tan(30) = AB/AC or sin(30) = AB/BC, where BC = x.
- sin(30) = sqrt(3) / x
- x = sqrt(3) / sin(30) = sqrt(3) / (1/2) = 2*sqrt(3)
