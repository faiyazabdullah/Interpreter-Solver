PROBLEM 529 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function with a yellow point labeled ($-\frac{\pi}{3},2). It has a maximum point at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{3}, 2\right)$ and an amplitude of 1.8 . What is the midline equation of the function?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph of a trigonometric function. A point is plotted on the graph at coordinates (-π/3, 2). The problem states the amplitude of the function is 1.8, and the function has a maximum at the given point. This means the midline will be below the maximum by the amount of the amplitude.

STEP 2: TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTION ANALYSIS
The function appears to be a cosine function. The maximum occurs at the point (-π/3, 2). The amplitude is 1.8. To find the midline, we need to subtract the amplitude from the y-coordinate of the maximum point: 2 - 1.8 = 0.2. So the midline equation is y = 0.2.

STEP 3: PREDICATE GENERATION
Based on the information and analysis above, the following predicates can be generated:

PREDICATES:
Point(A)
PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(x,y))
Equals(A,(-π/3,2))
AmplitudeOf: AmplitudeOf(f)
Equals(AmplitudeOf(f),1.8)
MaximumOf: MaximumOf(f)
MaximumOf(f,A)
