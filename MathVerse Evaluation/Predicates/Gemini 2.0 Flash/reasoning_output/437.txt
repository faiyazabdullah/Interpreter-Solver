PROBLEM 437 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (-1,3) and (-1,-3). It's center is at (-1,0) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at (-1,$3\sqrt{2}$) and (-1, -$3\sqrt{2}$). Find the equation of the hyperbola.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows a hyperbola, a coordinate system with x and y axes, points representing the center, vertices, and foci of the hyperbola.
- Points: Center at (-1, 0), Vertices at (-1, 3) and (-1, -3), Foci at (-1, $3\sqrt{2}$) and (-1, -$3\sqrt{2}$).
- Lines: The x and y axes are lines.
- Measurements: The distances between the center and vertices, and the center and foci are indicated.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The distance from the center to each vertex is equal (3 units).
- The distance from the center to each focus is equal ($3\sqrt{2}$ units).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The hyperbola intersects the y-axis at the vertices.
- The center, vertices and foci are all on the line x = -1, parallel to the y-axis.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The hyperbola opens upwards and downwards, indicating it's a vertical hyperbola.
- The standard form of a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis is $\frac{(y-k)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{b^2} = 1$, where (h, k) is the center, a is the distance from the center to a vertex, and c is the distance from the center to a focus.
- In this case, the center is (-1, 0), so h = -1 and k = 0.
- The distance from the center to a vertex is a = 3.
- The distance from the center to a focus is c = $3\sqrt{2}$.
- We know that $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$, so $(3\sqrt{2})^2 = 3^2 + b^2$, which means $18 = 9 + b^2$, so $b^2 = 9$. Thus, b = 3.
- Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is $\frac{y^2}{9} - \frac{(x+1)^2}{9} = 1$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The analysis has identified all the key geometric elements and relationships necessary to define the hyperbola, its center, vertices, and foci.
