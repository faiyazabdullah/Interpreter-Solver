PROBLEM 602 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A piecewise function, with 2 segments constructed by a line passing (-5,1), (-3,2), and (-1,4) and a line passing (-1,5), (3,3), and (5,1), as shown in the figure. Let $f$ be the function given by the following graph. What is the domain of $f$?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a piecewise function graph.
- There are line segments connecting points.
- Some points are marked with open circles, indicating a discontinuity.
- Some points are marked with closed circles.
- The axes are labeled x and y.
- The x-axis ranges from -6 to 6.
- The y-axis ranges from 0 to 5.
- Points: (-5,1), (-3,2), (-1,4) and (-1,5), (3,3), (5,1) are identified.
- There's a discontinuity at x = -1.
- The graph consists of two distinct line segments connected in a piecewise manner.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit right angles or perpendicular lines are marked.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal lengths or shapes are explicitly marked.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line segments intersect at (-1, 4) (open circle) and (-1, 5) (closed circle) creating a discontinuity.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph represents a piecewise function with a discontinuity at x = -1.
- The domain can be inferred from the x-values covered by the graph.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary geometric properties have been identified to determine the domain of the function.
