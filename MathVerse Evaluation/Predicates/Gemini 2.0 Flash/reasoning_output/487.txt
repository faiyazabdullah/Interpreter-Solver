PROBLEM 487 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a piecewise function going through points (-3, 0), (0, 5), and (3, 5). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a piecewise function graphed on a coordinate plane.
- The function consists of three line segments.
- The line segments connect the points (-3, 0), (0, 5), (3, 5), and (7, 9), forming a continuous graph.
- The x-axis ranges from -10 to 10 and the y-axis ranges from -10 to 11, with gridlines at integer values.
- We want to determine the domain and range of the function.

STEP 2: ANALYSIS OF POINTS AND SEGMENTS
- The first segment connects (-3, 0) and (0, 5).
- The second segment connects (0, 5) and (3, 5).
- The third segment connects (3, 5) and (7, 9).
- The domain spans from x = -3 to x = 7.
- The range spans from y = 0 to y = 9.

STEP 3: DOMAIN AND RANGE
- The domain of the function is the interval [-3, 7].
- The range of the function is the interval [0, 9].
