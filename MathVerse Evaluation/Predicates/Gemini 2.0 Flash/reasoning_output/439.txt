PROBLEM 439 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Point $A$ is on the following unit circle with radius 1, and forms a red right triangle with an angle of $\frac{\pi}{4}$. What are the coordinates of point $A$ ?
Enter an exact value or round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Circle, Triangle
- Points: A, origin (0,0)
- Lines: Lines forming the right triangle
- Angles: Right angle, angle of π/4
- Measurements: Radius of the circle is 1.
- Special markings: Right angle symbol.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: Origin (0,0)
- Point on circle: A
- Radius: 1
- Implied relationship: The x and y coordinates of point A correspond to the cosine and sine of the angle π/4, respectively, because the circle has radius 1.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle at origin is π/4.
- One angle is a right angle.
- Implied relationship: The triangle formed is a right triangle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Radius is 1.
- Implied relationship: Since the angle is π/4, the triangle is an isosceles right triangle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point A lies on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Unit circle implies that x^2 + y^2 = 1
- The triangle is a right triangle, allowing trigonometric functions to be used to define coordinates of point A.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Enough information to define the coordinates of point A based on the given angle and radius.
