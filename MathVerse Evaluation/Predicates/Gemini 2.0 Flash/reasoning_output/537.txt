PROBLEM 537 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph of a trigonometric function. A maximum point is located at $(\frac{1}{4}\pi, -2.2)$ and a minimum point is located at $(\frac{3}{4}\pi, -8.5)$. The x-axis and y-axis are visible. The graph has a periodic waveform.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The graph shows repetitive patterns, suggesting some kind of symmetry and the period can be observed.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The x and y axes intersect at the origin (0, 0). The point $(\frac{1}{4}\pi, -2.2)$ is a maximum of the function, and $(\frac{3}{4}\pi, -8.5)$ is a minimum.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The period of the function can be determined by twice the horizontal distance between a maximum and a minimum.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The location of a maximum and a minimum are given, the fact the axes are perpendicular is visible, and the periodic nature of the graph is apparent.
