PROBLEM 533 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $(-3.5,-0.8)$, and it has a maximum point at $(4.1,0.7)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trigonometric function's graph.
- Two points are marked: $(-3.5, -0.8)$ and $(4.1, 0.7)$.
- A dashed horizontal line is drawn.
- The axes are labeled as x and y.

STEP 2: AMPLITUDE ANALYSIS
- The amplitude of the function can be calculated as half the difference between the maximum and minimum y-values.
- The maximum point is given as $(4.1, 0.7)$, so the maximum y-value is 0.7.
- The midline is at y = -0.8.  The distance from the midline to the maximum is the amplitude. Thus, we can also determine the amplitude as the difference between the y-value of the max point and the midline.
- The amplitude is $0.7 - (-0.8) = 1.5$.
