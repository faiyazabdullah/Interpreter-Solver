PROBLEM 424 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure above, a triangle has an angle of 50Â° and two sides of 12m and 13.1m. Calculate the area of the following triangle.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle.
- The triangle has an angle of 50 degrees.
- Two sides of the triangle are 12m and 13.1m.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- One angle is given as 50 degrees.
- No perpendicularity is shown.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal elements are marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- There is an intersection of sides forming a vertex

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Law of Cosines can be used to find the length of the third side.
- Area = (1/2) * a * b * sin(C), where a and b are sides and C is the angle between them.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates include the two sides and the angle between them, which is sufficient to find the area.

PREDICATES:
Triangle(A,B,C)
LengthOf(Line(A,B),12)
LengthOf(Line(A,C),13.1)
MeasureOf(Angle(B,A,C),50)
