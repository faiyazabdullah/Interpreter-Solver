PROBLEM 054 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Place a ruler and a triangular plate as shown in the figure, angle 1 = 40.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There are triangles, lines and angles.
- A ruler and a right triangle are placed in the figure.
- Angle 1 is given as 40 degrees.
- The triangle is a right triangle.
- There is angle 2 in the figure.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 is 40 degrees.
- One angle of the triangle is 90 degrees.
- We are asked to find the degree of angle 2.
- The ruler is a straight line, thus the angle between the ruler and the line forming 40 degrees angle and the 90 degrees of the right triangle is supplementary.
- The angle between the ruler and the side forming 90 degree angle is 180 - 90 - 40 = 50.
- Angle 2 and this angle form 90 degrees. So, angle 2 is 90 - 50 = 40 + 5 = 45 degrees.
- One side of the triangle is parallel to the ruler.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Angle 1 and the angle formed between ruler and adjacent side of the right angle sums up to 50 degrees.
- Using complementary angles, angle 2 is 45 degrees.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Make sure we have recorded everything that are needed.
