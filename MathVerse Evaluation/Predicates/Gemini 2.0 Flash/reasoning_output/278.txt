PROBLEM 278 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two triangles W in green and W' in blue are similar according to a reference point F. Find the scale factor from W to W'.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Two triangles (one blue, one green), several lines, several angles, a point. The triangles are similar. The larger triangle is labeled as "W" and the smaller as "W'". There is a reference point F.
- Points: F, W', W.
- Lines: Lines connect F, W', and W to form the two triangles.
- Measurements: FW' = x, W'W = 8, FW = 12. Note that FW = FW' + W'W. Therefore, 12 = x + 8 and x=4.
- Special markings: The two triangles are right triangles.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Both triangles have a right angle.
- The dashed lines might imply that the triangles share a common angle at F.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two triangles are similar.
- FW = FW' + W'W, implies FW = 12.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- W' lies on the line FW.
- W' lies between F and W.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides should be equal. We are given FW = 12 and FW' = x. The length of the segment W'W is 8 so x=4. Thus, FW' = 4 and FW=12.
- Scale factor from W to W' is FW'/FW = 4/12 = 1/3.
