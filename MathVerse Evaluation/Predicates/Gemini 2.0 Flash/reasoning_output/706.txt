PROBLEM 706 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the following figure.Find the total surface area of the triangular prism shown. The height is 16cm. The base is an isosceles triangle with waist length of 10cm and base length of 12cm.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows a triangular prism. The base is an isosceles triangle. There are rectangles forming the sides of the prism.
- Points: The points are not labeled but are implied at the vertices of the triangles and rectangles.
- Lines: The lines are the edges of the triangles and rectangles.
- Measurements: The base of the triangle is 12cm, the equal sides of the isosceles triangle are 10cm each, and the height of the prism is 16cm. Also, 'x' is the height of the triangular face.
- Markings: Right angle indicator is present, indicating x as height. Equal length markers on the triangle.
- Implied constructions: Altitude/height from top vertex of isosceles triangle to its base.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Right angle exists between the height of the triangle and its base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two sides of the isosceles triangle are equal in length, as indicated by the tick marks.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect to form the vertices of the triangles and rectangles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Pythagorean theorem can be used to calculate x, the height of the isosceles triangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information for defining the shape and measurements is present.
