PROBLEM 117 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use a sector piece of paper with a central angle of 120.0 and a radius of 3.0 to roll into a cone-shaped bottomless paper cap (as shown in the picture), then the height of the paper is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Sector, circle, cone. The cone has a visible height and base radius.
- Measurements: The sector has a central angle of 120 degrees and a radius of 3. The base radius of the cone is 3.
- Relationships: The arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone. The radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone is a circle with a radius of 3.
- The sector is a part of a circle with a radius of 3.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The sector has a central angle of 120 degrees.
- The height of the cone is perpendicular to the radius of the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the sector is equal to the slant height of the cone which is 3.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two straight edges of the sector join together to form the cone.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The arc length of the sector equals the circumference of the base of the cone. We can set up an equation to solve for the base radius using the sector radius (3) and central angle (120 degrees).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- I have all the necessary relationships. The radius of the sector is the slant height of the cone. I can use the relationship between arc length of sector and circumference of base to find the radius of base of the cone. Then Pythagorean theorem can be used.
