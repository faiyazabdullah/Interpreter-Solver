PROBLEM 235 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure, four rays intersect and form 16 angles, and two upright rays are parallel. m \angle 3 = 110 and m \angle 12 = 55. Find the measure of \angle 1.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two parallel lines intersected by two transversals. There are 16 angles formed at the intersections. The measures of angles 3 and 12 are given as 110 and 55 degrees, respectively. I need to find the measure of angle 1.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles present in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle 3 and angle 7 are corresponding angles. Since the two lines are parallel, angle 7 is also 110 degrees. Angle 3 and angle 2 are supplementary, so angle 2 = 180-110 = 70. Angles 1 and 2 are vertical angles. Angle 1 and 3 are supplementary to angle 2 and angle 4, respectively. Angles 11 and 12 are interior angles on the same side of the transversal, so they are supplementary. Therefore, angle 11 = 180 - 55 = 125 degrees. Angle 15 and angle 11 are vertical angles and therefore, angle 15 = 125 degrees. Angle 12 and angle 16 are vertical angles and therefore, angle 16 = 55 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Vertical angles are congruent. Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines and a transversal are congruent. Alternate interior angles are congruent, and alternate exterior angles are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The transversals intersect at various points on the parallel lines and create angles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Using the properties of parallel lines and transversals, along with vertical and supplementary angles, I can find relationships between all angles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The given information (angle 3 = 110, angle 12 = 55, and parallel lines) is sufficient to determine the measure of angle 1.
