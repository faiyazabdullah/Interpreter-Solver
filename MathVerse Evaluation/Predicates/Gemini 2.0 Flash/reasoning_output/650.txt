PROBLEM 650 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The composite solid consists of two hemispheres stuck together. The diameter of large hemisphere is 12 centimeters and small hemisphere is 6 centimeters. Find the volume of the solid.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two hemispheres are visible.
- One hemisphere has a diameter of 12 cm, the other 6 cm.
- No angles or parallel lines are marked.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The large hemisphere has a diameter of 12 cm, thus a radius of 6 cm.
- The small hemisphere has a diameter of 6 cm, thus a radius of 3 cm.
- We consider each hemisphere as half of a complete sphere.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are explicitly marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent shapes or equal lengths are explicitly marked other than the diameters.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The smaller hemisphere is on top of the larger hemisphere.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The total volume is the sum of the volumes of the two hemispheres.
- Volume of a sphere is (4/3) * pi * r^3, so volume of a hemisphere is (2/3) * pi * r^3

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information needed to calculate the volumes of the hemispheres.
