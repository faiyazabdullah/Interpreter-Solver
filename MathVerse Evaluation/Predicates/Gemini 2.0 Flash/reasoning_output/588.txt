PROBLEM 588 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graphs of logarithm function $f(x)=\ln x$ passing (1,4) and logarithm function $g(x)$ passing (1,0) are shown below. $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$.

Hence state the equation of $g(x)$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two logarithmic functions, $f(x) = \ln x$ and $g(x)$.
- The graph of $f(x)$ passes through the point (1,0).
- The graph of $g(x)$ is a transformation of $f(x)$.
- The graph of $g(x)$ appears to be a vertical translation of $f(x)$.
- The curve $f(x)$ passes through approximately $(2.7,1)$ and $(7.4, 2)$.
- The curve $g(x)$ passes through approximately $(2.7,4)$ and $(7.4,5)$.

STEP 2: VERTICAL SHIFT ANALYSIS
- If $g(x)$ is a vertical translation of $f(x)$, then $g(x) = f(x) + c$ for some constant $c$.
- Since $f(x) = \ln x$, we have $g(x) = \ln x + c$.
- From the graphs, we see that $g(x)$ is a vertical shift of $f(x)$ by approximately 3 units.
- Therefore, $g(x) = \ln x + 3$.

STEP 3: VERIFICATION
- At $x=1$, $f(1) = \ln 1 = 0$.
- At $x=1$, $g(1) = \ln 1 + 3 = 0 + 3 = 3$.
- The equation of g(x) is $g(x) = \ln x + 3$

PREDICATES:
