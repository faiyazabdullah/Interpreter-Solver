PROBLEM 581 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: For function graphed below, it passes (0,-2) and (3,0) and starts from (-1,-5). Determine if it has an inverse function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a curve on a coordinate plane. The curve passes through the points (0,-2), (3,0) and appears to start from approximately (-1,-5).
- The task is to determine if the function has an inverse function. A function has an inverse if it passes the horizontal line test.
- Visually, the curve passes the horizontal line test.

STEP 2: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The key relationships are the points the curve passes through and the fact that it appears to pass the horizontal line test.

PREDICATES:
PointLiesOnLine: Point((0,-2)),Line($1,$2)
PointLiesOnLine: Point((3,0)),Line($1,$2)
PointLiesOnLine: Point((-1,-5)),Line($1,$2)
