PROBLEM 219 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find A B if \triangle A B C is an isosceles triangle with A B \cong B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC.
- The sides AB, BC, and AC are labeled with expressions 2x-7, 4x-21, and x-3 respectively.
- It is given that triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB congruent to BC.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no right angles or perpendicular relationships indicated in the image.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- It is given that AB is congruent to BC. This means their lengths are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The vertices A, B, and C are the intersection points of the sides.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is congruent to BC, we have the equation 2x-7 = 4x-21.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information and the congruence of sides AB and BC are sufficient to set up an equation and find the value of x. This value can then be used to determine the lengths of the sides.
