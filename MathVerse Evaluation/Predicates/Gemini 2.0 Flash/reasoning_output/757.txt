PROBLEM 757 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, point O lies on line AB. There are four angles in the figure, which are \frac{x}{6}, \frac{x}{4}, \frac{x}{3}, and \frac{x}{2}. What is the value of x?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a line AB with a point O on it.
- Several rays emanate from point O, forming angles.
- The angles are given as x/6, x/4, x/3, and x/2 degrees.
- Since point O lies on line AB, the sum of the angles on one side of the line must be 180 degrees.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The sum of the angles x/6, x/4, x/3, and x/2 is 180 degrees because they form a straight angle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The equation x/6 + x/4 + x/3 + x/2 = 180 can be used to solve for x.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information has been extracted from the image.
