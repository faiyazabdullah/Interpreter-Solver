PROBLEM 368 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A farmer wants to build a fence around the entire perimeter of his land, as shown in the diagram. The fencing costs £37 per metre. the lengths of EF and CD are x metre and y metre.
At £37 per metre of fencing, how much will it cost him to build the fence along the entire perimeter of the land?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a composite geometric figure consisting of lines and angles.
- Points are labeled as A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
- Line segments have labeled lengths: AF = 1 m, BC = 3 m, ED = 2 m, AB = 5 m. The total height from the top line to the bottom is 7 m.
- Lengths EF and CD are labeled as x m and y m, respectively.
- There are right angle markings at vertices B and G.
- Implied perpendicular relationships exist.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is a right angle.
- Angle FGE is a right angle.
- FG is perpendicular to GE.
- AB is perpendicular to BC.
- FG is parallel to AB and BC is parallel to GE.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruence or similarity markings are present.
- AB = 5, the total height is 7, so the distance from B to the top edge is 5, thus FG = 7-5 = 2
- AF = 1, BC = 3, so GE = BC - AF = 3 - 1 = 2

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at points A, B, C, D, E, F, and G.
- Point B lies on line AC.
- Point E lies on line DE.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height of the entire figure is given as 7 m.
- The length of AB is 5 m.
- Therefore, the length of FG is 7 - 5 = 2 m.
- AF = 1, BC = 3. Also, FG is perpendicular to GE and AB to BC.
- GE = BC - AF = 3 - 1 = 2 m

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates cover all necessary geometric relationships and given measurements.
- The diagram's constraints have been adequately represented to calculate the required values.
