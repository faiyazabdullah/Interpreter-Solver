PROBLEM 306 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a right triangle V X W, the hypotenuse V X is 75, and V W = 72, X W = 21. Express the ratio of \cos X as a decimal to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see a triangle V X W.
- The points are V, X, W.
- There is a right angle at W.
- The length of V W is 72.
- The length of X W is 21.
- The length of V X is 75.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle V W X is a right angle.
- Line V W is perpendicular to line X W.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no congruence markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines V W and X W intersect at W.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle V X W is a right triangle.
- We can use trigonometric ratios to find the cosine of angle X.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to express the cosine of angle X.
- Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse. The adjacent side to X is X W which is 21. The hypotenuse is V X which is 75. Therefore, cos X = 21/75.
