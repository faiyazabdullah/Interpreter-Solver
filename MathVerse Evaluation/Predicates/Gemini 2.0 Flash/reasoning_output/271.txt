PROBLEM 271 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: \odot P \cong \odot Q. Chord R S is on \odot P with length 3x and chord T U is on \odot Q with length 7 x - 44. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two circles are present.
- Circle P has points R and S on the circle. Line segment RS passes through point P.
- Circle Q has points T and U on the circle. Line segment TU passes through point Q.
- The circles are congruent.
- The length of RS is 3x.
- The arc TU has measure 7x-44.
- Arc RS has measure 155 degrees and arc TU has measure 205 degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- P is the center of circle P.
- Q is the center of circle Q.
- RS is a chord of circle P.
- TU is a chord of circle Q.
- Arc RS has measure 155 degrees.
- Arc TU has measure 205 degrees.
- Line segment RS goes through center P, thus is the diameter of the circle P.
- Line segment TU goes through center Q, thus is the diameter of the circle Q.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No right angles or perpendicularity is shown.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Circle P and circle Q are congruent.
- Length of RS is 3x.
- Length of TU is 7x-44.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- RS passes through the center P of the circle P.
- TU passes through the center Q of the circle Q.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since Circle P is congruent to Circle Q, their diameters are also equal.
- Hence RS = TU.
- The central angle corresponding to arc RS is supplementary to 155. So it equals 180-155 = 25.
- The central angle corresponding to arc TU is supplementary to 205. So it equals 180-205 = -25. No
- Two circles are congruent and diameters are equal. so 3x=7x-44. Also diameters are twice the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Need to find x.
- All information has been recorded.
