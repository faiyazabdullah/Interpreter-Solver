PROBLEM 395 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A circle with a radius of $3 \mathrm{~cm}$. Find the exact area of the circle shown.

Give your answer as an exact value in terms of $\pi $.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with a labeled radius.
- There's a circle and a line segment representing the radius.
- The radius is labeled as 3 cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The shape is a circle.
- There's a line segment from the center to the circumference, which is the radius.
- The radius is 3 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are explicitly marked or indicated.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius is labeled as 3 cm.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The radius starts at the center of the circle and ends on the circumference.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of a circle is $\pi r^2$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the radius, which is sufficient to compute the area.
