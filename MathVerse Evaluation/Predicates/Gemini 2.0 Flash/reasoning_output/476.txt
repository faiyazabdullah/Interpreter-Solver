PROBLEM 476 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two curves are symmetrical about the x-axis. Use the vertical line test to determine if this relation is a function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with x and y axes.
- There are two curves that appear to be symmetrical with respect to the x-axis.
- The curves intersect at the point (1, 0).
- There are no explicitly marked angles, lengths, or shapes besides the graph itself.
- The question is whether the relation is a function using the vertical line test.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two curves are symmetric about the x-axis.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The curves intersect at (1, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Symmetry with respect to the x-axis implies that for any point (x, y) on one curve, the point (x, -y) is on the other curve.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The vertical line test is relevant here. A vertical line can intersect the graph at more than one point.

PointLiesOnLine(Point(1,0), Line(x,y))
Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y))
Symmetrical: Symmetrical(Curve1, Curve2, Line(x))
