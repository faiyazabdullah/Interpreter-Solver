PROBLEM 049 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in the inscribed pentagon ABCDE of circle O, angle CAD = 35.0, angle AED = 115.0, then the degree of angle B is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a pentagon ABCDE inscribed in a circle O. We are given the measure of angle CAD as 30 degrees and the measure of angle AED as 115 degrees. We need to determine the measure of angle B.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
Circle O is given, and points A, B, C, D, and E lie on circle O. Lines AC, AD, and AE are chords.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle CAD = 30 degrees and angle AED = 115 degrees are given.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruent or equal shapes are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The vertices of the pentagon lie on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since pentagon ABCDE is inscribed in circle O, the sum of opposite angles is not necessarily 180 degrees because it's a pentagon. However, we can use inscribed angles to find the measure of arc CD. Angle CAD intercepts arc CD.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We need to find the measure of angle B. To do this, we need to relate angle B to other angles or arcs in the circle.
