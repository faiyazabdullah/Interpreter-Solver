PROBLEM 612 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The curve shown in the figure is a quadratic function opening upwards and passes through the origin. Does the graphed function have an even or odd power?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parabola opening upwards, with its vertex at the origin (0,0).
- The parabola is a quadratic function.
- The x and y axes are labeled.
- The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular, forming a right angle.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis and passes through the origin, it has an even power function.
