PROBLEM 556 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: On the following unit circle, $\theta$ is in radians and $\tan (\theta)=\frac{0.98}{0.2}=4.9$. Without a calculator, evaluate the following expressions to the nearest hundredth or as an exact ratio.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at the origin (0,0).
- A point (0.2, 0.98) lies on the circle.
- A line segment connects the origin to the point (0.2, 0.98).
- An angle $\theta$ is formed between the positive x-axis and the line segment.
- The circle appears to be a unit circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The circle is centered at the origin (0,0).
- The point (0.2, 0.98) lies on the circle.
- The line segment connecting the origin to the point (0.2, 0.98) is a radius of the circle.
- Since it is a unit circle, the radius is 1.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle $\theta$ is formed between the positive x-axis and the line segment.
- No explicit right angles are marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The circle appears to be a unit circle, so its radius is 1.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line segment intersects the circle at (0.2, 0.98).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since (0.2, 0.98) is on the unit circle, $0.2^2 + 0.98^2 \approx 1$, confirming it's close to a unit circle.
- $\tan(\theta) = \frac{0.98}{0.2} = 4.9$

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the information from the diagram has been extracted.
