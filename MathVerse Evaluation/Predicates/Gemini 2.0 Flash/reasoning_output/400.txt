PROBLEM 400 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A figure with a radius of $ 11 \mathrm{~m}$. Find the area of the shape shown.

Give your answer as an exact value.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quarter of a circle with radius $11 \mathrm{~m}$.
- The shape includes a square with one corner at the center of the circle.
- There is a right angle symbol at the corner of the square.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The shape is a sector of a circle with radius 11m. The central angle is 90 degrees.
- Two sides of the shape are radii of the circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle at the corner where the two radii meet, which means the angle of the sector is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radii are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The shape is formed by two radii and an arc.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Area of the quarter circle $= \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi (11)^2 = \frac{121\pi}{4}$
- Area of the square = $11 \times 11 = 121$
Area of the shape is Area of the quarter circle - area of square.
Required Area = $ \frac{1}{4} \times \pi \times 11^{2} - (11 \times 11) =  \frac{121\pi}{4} - 121 $
$ \frac{121(\pi - 4)}{4} $.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information about the radius and the 90 degree angle is necessary for calculating the area.
