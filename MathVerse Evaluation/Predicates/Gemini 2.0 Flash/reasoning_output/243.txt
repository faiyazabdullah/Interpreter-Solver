PROBLEM 243 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A plane travels from Des Moines to Phoenix with a distance 110x + 53, on to Atlanta with a distance 150x + 91, and back to Des Moines with a distance 73.8x, as shown below. Find the distance in miles from Phoenix to Atlanta if the total trip was 3482 miles.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle with vertices labeled Des Moines, Phoenix, and Atlanta.
- The sides of the triangle have lengths 110x + 53, 150x + 91, and 73.8x.
- There are no special markings like right angles, parallel lines, or congruent sides.
- The total trip distance is 3482 miles, which means the sum of the three sides is 3482.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no right angles or perpendicular relationships explicitly marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no congruent sides or angles marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at the vertices: Des Moines, Phoenix, and Atlanta.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of the sides is equal to the total trip distance: (110x + 53) + (150x + 91) + (73.8x) = 3482

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information to describe the diagram and the problem constraints is present.
