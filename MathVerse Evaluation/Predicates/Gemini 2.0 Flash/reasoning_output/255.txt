PROBLEM 255 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: m is the perpendicular bisector of X Z, W Z = 14.9. Find W X.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: The image shows two triangles (WXY and WZY). Line m is a line.
- Points: The image has points W, X, Y, and Z.
- Lines: The image has lines WY, WX, WZ, XY, and ZY. Line m is present.
- Measurements: WZ = 14.9
- Special Markings: There is a right angle marking at angle WYX and angle WYZ. There are congruent markings on lines XY and ZY.
- Implied Constructions: WY is perpendicular to XZ and bisects XZ. Line m is perpendicular to XZ.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not Applicable

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle WYX and WYZ are right angles, implying perpendicularity.
- Angle XWY and angle ZWY are not necessarily right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- XY is congruent to ZY. This means that Y is the midpoint of XZ.
- WZ = 14.9 is given.
- Triangle WXY and WZY share a common side WY.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line WY intersects line XZ at point Y.
- Point Y lies on line m.
- Point Y lies on line XZ.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since line m is the perpendicular bisector of line XZ, every point on line m is equidistant from X and Z. Therefore, WX = WZ.
- Triangles WXY and WZY are congruent by SAS criterion.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all points, lines, measurements, and relationships.
- We have noted the perpendicularity and congruence.
- We have related the given information and identified what needs to be found.
