PROBLEM 477 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a curve goes through the origin. Use the vertical line test to determine if this relation is a function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a curve on a Cartesian coordinate system. The curve passes through the origin (0,0). The x-axis and y-axis are shown. The curve extends into quadrants I and III. The curve is increasing. The vertical line test can be applied to the relation shown in the graph.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No specific congruence or equality is marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The curve intersects the x and y axes at the origin.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The curve passes through the origin (0,0).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The image shows a curve passes through the origin, which helps to understand the shape of the relation shown in the diagram. Since the question asks whether the relation is a function, we can analyze it using the vertical line test.
