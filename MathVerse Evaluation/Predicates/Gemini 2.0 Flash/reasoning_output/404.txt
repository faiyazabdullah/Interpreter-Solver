PROBLEM 404 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of the figure is $ 96.4 \mathrm{~mm}$. Consider the sector below.

Calculate the area. Give your answer correct to four decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sector of a circle.
- There is a right angle marked.
- The radius is given as 96.4 mm.
- We need to find the area of the sector.
- The sector is a quarter of a circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 96.4 mm.
- The central angle is 90 degrees (right angle).
- The sector represents 1/4 of the total circle area.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is one right angle, meaning the two lines forming the sector are perpendicular.
- The angle is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Both radii of the sector are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two lines forming the sector intersect at the circle's center.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Area of the sector can be calculated using the formula: (angle/360) * pi * r^2. Since angle = 90, the formula is (90/360) * pi * r^2 = (1/4) * pi * r^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the necessary information to solve the problem, including the radius and the central angle.
