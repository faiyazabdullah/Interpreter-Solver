PROBLEM 604 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

How much faster is Oliver traveling?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph with two lines, labeled "Oliver" and "Justin". The x-axis represents Time, and the y-axis represents Distance. The graph shows the distance traveled by each competitor over time.
The Oliver line passes through the points (0,0) and approximately (5, 175).
The Justin line passes through the points (0, approximately 15) and approximately (5, 125).
We need to determine how much faster Oliver is traveling than Justin.
The scale of the axes appear to be linear.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
No explicit angles or perpendicular relationships are given. We can infer that time and distance are generally perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked congruent segments or angles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The lines intersect at the origin.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The slope of each line represents the speed of each competitor.
Oliver's speed can be calculated as (175 - 0) / (5 - 0) = 35.
Justin's speed can be calculated as (125 - 25) / (5 - 1) = 100 / 4 = 25.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We need the coordinates of points on both lines to determine the slopes accurately. The predicates below capture the necessary information.
