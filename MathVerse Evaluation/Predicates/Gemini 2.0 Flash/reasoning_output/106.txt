PROBLEM 106 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: This question examines the theorem of angle of circumference, the key is to answer it based on the relationship between the central angle and the angle of circumference of the same chord. 4.0. As shown in the figure, AB is the diameter of circle O, C is the point on circle O (except A and B), angle AOD = 136.0, then the degree of angle C is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle with center O. AB is a diameter of the circle. Points C and D lie on the circle. Angle AOD is given as 136 degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
O is the center of the circle. A, B, C, and D are points on the circle. AB is a diameter, therefore OA and OB are radii. OD and OC are also radii. Thus, OA=OB=OC=OD. Angle AOD is a central angle. Angle C is an inscribed angle subtending arc AD.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle AOD = 136 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
OA = OB = OC = OD.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines intersect at points A, B, C, D and O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The angle at the circumference is half the angle at the center subtended by the same arc.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We need to represent all points, lines, the circle, the angle and the fact that AB is a diameter.
