PROBLEM 431 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Iainâ€™s car has run out of petrol. He walks 12 km west and then 9 km south looking for a petrol station.

If he is now $h$ km directly from his starting point, find the value of $h$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle.
- The vertices of the triangle are not labeled, so let's label them as A, B, and C, where angle B is the right angle.
- The sides of the triangle are 9, 12, and h.
- We have a right triangle with legs of length 9 and 12, and a hypotenuse of length h.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle has a right angle at vertex B. Therefore, lines AB and BC are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no congruent figures in the image.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and BC intersect at point B.
- Lines AC and AB intersect at point A.
- Lines AC and BC intersect at point C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The Pythagorean theorem applies since we have a right triangle.
- h^2 = 9^2 + 12^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates capture the right triangle, the side lengths, and the right angle, which is enough information to solve for h.
