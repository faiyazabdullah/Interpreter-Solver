PROBLEM 194 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Put the ruler, the triangle ruler and the round nut on the desktop as shown in the figure, angle CAB = 60.0, if AD = 6.0, then the outer diameter of the round nut is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Triangle, circles, lines, and a rectangle.
- Points: A, B, C, D.
- Measurements: Angle CAB = 60 degrees, AD = 6.
- Special markings: Right angle at C.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There is a round nut, and a smaller circle in the drawing.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle CAB = 60 degrees.
- Angle ACB = 90 degrees.
- Angle ABC = 30 degrees (since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180).
- Line AC is along the edge of a rectangle, and is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Need to determine the relationship between AD and the diameter of the round nut.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point A is at the corner of the triangle.
- Point A is also touching the round nut.
- AD is along the base.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The length of AD (6.0) is given. The angle CAB is 60 degrees, so the diameter can be found.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All needed info is gathered for the setup.
