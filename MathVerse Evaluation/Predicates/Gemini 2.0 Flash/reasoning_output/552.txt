PROBLEM 552 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Ashlynn models the relationship between the temperature $C$ of a hot cup of tea (in degrees Celsius) and time $T$ since the tea was poured into the cup (in minutes) as $C=20+20 \cdot 0.88^T$. The temperature decreases when time increases, and passes points(0, 40). She wanted to graph the relationship over the first half hour. Here is her work: What mistakes did Ashlynn make when drawing the graph?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph with temperature (degrees Celsius) on the y-axis and time (minutes) on the x-axis. The graph is a curve that starts at approximately (0, 40) and decreases, approaching a horizontal asymptote around y=20. The curve passes through the points (5, approximately 32), (10, approximately 26), (15, approximately 23), (20, approximately 22), and (25, approximately 20.5).

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The curve intersects the y-axis at (0,40). The curve appears to approach the line y=20 as an asymptote.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The graph shows a decreasing exponential relationship between temperature and time.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The description above captures the necessary information to understand the graph.
