PROBLEM 759 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, three lines intersect at a point. The graph consists of the intersection of three lines, two of the angles are y°, and one of the angles is 50°. What is the value of y?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There are three lines intersecting at a single point.
- There are angles marked as y° and 50°.
- Vertical angles are formed by the intersecting lines.
- We want to find the value of y.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are two angles marked with y°. These are vertical angles, therefore equal.
- The angle adjacent to 50° and y° on a straight line sums to 180°.
- Vertical angles are equal.

STEP 3: EQUATION FORMULATION
- From the relationships observed, we know that y° + y° + 50° + angle opposite of 50° = 360°
So: 2y + 2(50) = 360 => 2y + 100=360 =>2y=260 => y = 130
Or we could simply use y + y + 50 = 180 to get to y = 65 since we have y opposite y and a 50 directly opposite another 50.

STEP 4: REASONING FOR SOLUTION
- Since three lines intersect, two angles are equal to y, and one angle is 50.

STEP 5: PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGY
- Recognize that angles on one side of the intersection of a straight line should sum to 180 degrees.
- Realize that 50 + y + y = 180 to get to 2y = 130. So y = 65.
