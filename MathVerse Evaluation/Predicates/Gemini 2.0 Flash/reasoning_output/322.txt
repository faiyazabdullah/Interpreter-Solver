PROBLEM 322 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: QM is perpendicular to MN, QP is perpendicular to NP, the length of MQ is 2x+2, and the length of QP is 4x-8, NQ is the angular bisector of angle MNP. Find Q M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains two lines intersecting at a point N.
- There are points M, N, P, and Q.
- Segments MN, MQ, NP, and QP form right angles.
- NQ is an angle bisector of angle MNP.
- MQ = 2x + 2
- QP = 4x - 8

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle QMN is a right angle.
- Angle QPN is a right angle.
- Line NQ bisects angle MNP.  Therefore, angles MNQ and PNQ are equal.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Since MQ is perpendicular to MN and QP is perpendicular to NP, and NQ is the angle bisector, then triangle QMN and QPN are congruent.
- Therefore, MQ = QP

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines MN and NP intersect at N.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- MQ = 2x + 2
- QP = 4x - 8
- MQ = QP

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The relationships are sufficient for solving the problem.
