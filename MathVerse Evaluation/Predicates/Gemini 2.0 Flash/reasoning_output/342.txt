PROBLEM 342 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the following diagram. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 38° and angle B is 49°.

Find the true bearing of point C from point B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Points A, B, and C. Triangle ABC.
- Lines: Lines connecting A, B, and C forming triangle ABC. There are also lines extending from each point (A, B, and C) indicating cardinal directions.
- Angles: Angle at A is 38 degrees, angle at B is 49 degrees.
- Special markings: Dashed lines forming triangle ABC. Arrows indicating directions.
- Implied constructions: North direction lines extending upwards from points A and B.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle A is 38 degrees.
- Angle B is 49 degrees.
- The lines extending from points A, B, and C indicate directions. The upward-pointing lines at A and B point towards North, implying these lines are parallel and perpendicular to the horizontal lines.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There is no explicit indication of congruent sides or angles in triangle ABC, other than the angles provided.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at points A, B, and C, forming the vertices of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, therefore angle C can be calculated.
- The lines representing North at points A and B are parallel.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The diagram provides the angles at A and B. The relative positions of points A, B, and C are defined by the dashed triangle. The orientation of the North lines at A and B are essential for determining the true bearing of C from B.
