PROBLEM 787 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, the smaller circles each have radius 3. They are tangent to the larger circle at points A and C, and are tangent to each other at point B, which is the center of the larger circle. What is the perimeter of the shaded region?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Three circles, points A, B, C
- Lines: Implicit lines connecting points.
- Measurements: Radius of smaller circles = 3.
- Special markings: Tangent points at A, B, and C. B is the center of the large circle. The two smaller circles are tangent to each other at B. The two smaller circles are tangent to the larger circle at A and C.
- Implied constructions: Radii of the circles, perpendicularity at tangent points.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Let Circle(1) be the circle with center at some point O1 on line AB, radius 3.
- Let Circle(2) be the circle with center at some point O2 on line BC, radius 3.
- Let Circle(3) be the circle with center at B, and radius AB+BC = 6
- Point A lies on Circle(1) and Circle(3). Point B lies on Circle(1) and Circle(2) and is the center of Circle(3). Point C lies on Circle(2) and Circle(3).
- Line AB is a diameter of Circle(1). Line BC is a diameter of Circle(2).
- Since the two smaller circles are tangent at B, and tangent to the larger circle at A and C respectively, A, B, and C are collinear. Thus, AC is a diameter of Circle(3).

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is a straight angle = 180 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two smaller circles are congruent, radius = 3.
- The larger circle radius is twice the radius of the smaller circles, thus radius of the larger circle is 6. AB = BC, since B is the tangency point of the two smaller circles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two smaller circles intersect at B.
- Circle(1) and Circle(3) intersect at A. Circle(2) and Circle(3) intersect at C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB = BC, B is the midpoint of AC.
- AC is the diameter of Circle(3). AB and BC are diameters of Circle(1) and Circle(2) respectively.
- The shaded area consists of the area of the large circle minus the area of the two smaller circles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All relevant geometric shapes and relationships are identified.
