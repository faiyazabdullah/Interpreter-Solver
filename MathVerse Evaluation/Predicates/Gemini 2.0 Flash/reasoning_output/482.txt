PROBLEM 482 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a line goes through a hollow point (2,8) and a solid point (8,6). Write the domain and range of each function using interval notation.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a line segment on a coordinate plane.
- The line segment has one endpoint at (2,8) and another endpoint at (8,6).
- The endpoint (2,8) is represented by a hollow circle, indicating that it's not included in the line segment.
- The endpoint (8,6) is represented by a solid circle, indicating that it's included in the line segment.

STEP 2: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- To determine the domain and range, we need to identify the minimum and maximum x and y values of the line segment.
- The minimum x value is 2 (exclusive), and the maximum x value is 8 (inclusive).
- The minimum y value is 6 (inclusive), and the maximum y value is 8 (exclusive).
