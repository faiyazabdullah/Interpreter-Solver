PROBLEM 645 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A cone is sliced in half to produce the solid shown. The slant height is 9 centimeters and diameter is 3 centimeters.

Find the volume of the solid, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a 3D shape representing a cone sliced in half.
- A right angle is shown where the height of the cone would be.
- The length of the slant height is 9 cm.
- The length of the diameter is 3 cm.
- The radius of the cone is half the diameter: 1.5cm
- The dotted line segment is perpendicular to the diameter line segment.

STEP 2: CONE SLICE ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone is a semicircle.
- The height is perpendicular to the diameter of the base.

STEP 3: DIMENSION ANALYSIS
- Slant height = 9 cm
- Diameter = 3 cm
- Radius = 1.5 cm

STEP 4: FORMULAS AND VOLUME CALCULATION
- Volume of a cone: (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h
- Since it is half a cone, the formula is (1/2) * (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h
- Find the height using Pythagorean theorem: h^2 + r^2 = 9^2
- h^2 = 81 - 1.5^2 = 81 - 2.25 = 78.75
- h = sqrt(78.75) = 8.87 cm
