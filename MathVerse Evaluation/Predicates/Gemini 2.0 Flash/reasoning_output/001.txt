PROBLEM 001 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in triangle ABC, it is known that angle A = 80.0, angle B = 60.0, point D is on AB and point E is on AC, DE parallel BC, then the size of angle CED is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Triangle ABC, Line DE, Line BC
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Measurements: Angle A = 80 degrees, Angle B = 60 degrees
- Special markings: DE parallel to BC

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle A is given as 80 degrees.
- Angle B is given as 60 degrees.
- DE is parallel to BC, therefore Angle ADE = Angle ABC = 60 degrees, and Angle AED = Angle ACB
- Angle ACB can be calculated as 180 - Angle A - Angle B = 180 - 80 - 60 = 40 degrees.
- Therefore, Angle AED = 40 degrees.
- We want to find Angle CED. Angle AED + Angle CED = 180 degrees, thus Angle CED = 180 - 40 = 140 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality markings are present.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point D lies on AB.
- Point E lies on AC.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- DE is parallel to BC.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is included in the predicates.
