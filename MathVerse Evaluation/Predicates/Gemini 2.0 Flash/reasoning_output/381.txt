PROBLEM 381 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, one leg measuring 11. Solve for the unknown w.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right-angled triangle.
- The triangle has vertices which are unnamed, for simplicity we will call them A, B, C, where angle B is the right angle.
- One angle is marked as 60 degrees.
- One side, opposite the 60-degree angle has length 11.
- The hypotenuse has length w.
- The triangle is Triangle(A,B,C), with RightAngle(Angle(B)). Angle(A) = 60 degrees and LengthOf(Line(B,C)) = 11, LengthOf(Line(A,C)) = w.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the figure.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle B is a right angle (90 degrees).
- Angle A is 60 degrees.
- Angle C is therefore 180 - 90 - 60 = 30 degrees.
- Line(A,B) and Line(B,C) are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal figures are shown.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at points A, B, and C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The triangle is a right-angled triangle.
- Basic trigonometric ratios can be applied: sin(60) = 11/w.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information present is enough to find w using trigonometric ratios.
