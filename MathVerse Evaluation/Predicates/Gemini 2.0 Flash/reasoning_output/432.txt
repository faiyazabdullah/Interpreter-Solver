PROBLEM 432 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the distance between the two endpoints using the distance formula. The two end points of the line are (-3, 4) and (5, 2), respectively. Round to three decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There is a line segment drawn on a coordinate plane.
- The endpoints of the line segment are at (-3, 4) and (5, 2).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles or perpendicular relationships are marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit markings indicating congruence or equality.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line segment connects the points (-3, 4) and (5, 2).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The problem asks to find the distance between the two points using the distance formula.
- The points are at (-3, 4) and (5, 2).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The coordinates of the endpoints are sufficient to calculate the distance.
