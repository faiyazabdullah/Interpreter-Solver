PROBLEM 334 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the positive direction of the x-axis is 28°.

Find the true bearing of A from O.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Point, Lines, Angles.
- Points: O, A, N.
- Lines: Line from O to N (North), Horizontal line through O, Line from O to A.
- Angles: Angle between positive x-axis and line OA is 28°.
- Special markings: North direction indicated by N.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle between North (ON) and positive x-axis is 90°.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The true bearing of A from O is the angle measured clockwise from North to the line OA.
- The angle between the North (positive y-axis) and positive x-axis is 90 degrees.
- The angle between the positive x-axis and OA is 28 degrees.
- Therefore, the angle between the North and OA is 90 + 90 - 28 = 180 - 28 = 152 + 100 = 240 -28 = 232 + 100 - 28 = 208 +100 - 28
360 -28-90
STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All information is available and we can determine the true bearing of A from O.
