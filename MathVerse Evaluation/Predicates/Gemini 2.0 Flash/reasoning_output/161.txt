PROBLEM 161 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the homothetic figures are composed of a triangle ruler and its center projection under the light. If the ratio of the distance from the bulb to the vertex of the triangle ruler to the distance from the bulb to the corresponding vertex of the triangular ruler projection is 2.0:5.0, and the length of one edge of the triangle ruler is 8.0, Then the corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is ()

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two triangles that are homothetic figures, with the light bulb as the center of homothety. One triangle is a triangle ruler and the other is its projection. The ratio of the distance from the light bulb to a vertex of the triangle ruler to the corresponding vertex of the projection is 2:5. The length of one edge of the triangle ruler is 8. The problem is to find the length of the corresponding edge of the projection triangle.

STEP 2: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two triangles are similar because they are homothetic.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The ratio of corresponding sides of similar triangles is the same as the ratio of the distances from the center of homothety (the light bulb) to the corresponding vertices.
