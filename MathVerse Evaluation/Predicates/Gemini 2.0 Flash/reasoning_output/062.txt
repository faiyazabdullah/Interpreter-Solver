PROBLEM 062 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, point E is on the extended line of CA. If angle BAE = 40.0, then the size of angle ACD is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two lines AB and CD and an angle BAE.
- Point A, B, C, D, and E are present.
- Angle BAE = 40 degrees.
- AB and CD are parallel.
- Point E is on the extended line CA.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BAE is an exterior angle to an implied triangle (if we extend CA).
- Angle ACD is part of a transversal formed by lines AB and CD.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Since AB || CD, alternate interior angles are equal. Corresponding angles are equal.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line EA intersects line AB at point A.
- Line CA intersects line CD at point C.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB || CD, the angle BAE is an exterior angle of a transversal.
- Angle ACD and an angle adjacent to BAE are alternate interior angles, thus they are equal.
- Also, angle BAE and the adjacent angle form a linear pair and are supplementary.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information given (AB || CD, angle BAE = 40) is sufficient to determine the measure of angle ACD.

STEP 7: Correct the error and finalize the answer.
