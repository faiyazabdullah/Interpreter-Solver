PROBLEM 290 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right triangle, an acute angle is labeled as \angle 4 with an external angle of 123 degrees. Find m \angle 4.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a triangle with one right angle and an exterior angle of 123 degrees. One of the sides is labeled with length 4.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The triangle contains a right angle (90 degrees).
There is an exterior angle measuring 123 degrees.
The exterior angle and an adjacent interior angle form a linear pair and thus are supplementary.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruence or equality marks.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
No relevant intersections.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The triangle is a right triangle. The exterior angle is supplementary to the adjacent interior angle.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have a right triangle and know that the external angle is 123 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 4.
