PROBLEM 427 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A boat travels S 14^\circ E for 12 km and then changes direction to S 49^\circ E for another 16 km.

Hence write down the bearing that the boat should travel on to return to the starting point.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image contains a starting point, two line segments representing the boat's path, an implied triangle formed by these segments and a direct return path, and implied North-South-East-West directions at the start and current positions. There are also angles specified with respect to the North-South lines.
- Points: "Start" is a point. "Current" is a point. There are two other implied points where the boat changes direction.
- Lines: Two line segments of lengths 12 km and 16 km are shown. There is an implied line segment (x km) representing the direct path back to the starting point.
- Measurements: 12 km, 16 km, x km, 14 degrees, 49 degrees, and the angles marked as 'a' and 'b'.
- Markings: The North direction is marked. There are angles given with respect to the South.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angles: We have angles 14 degrees and 49 degrees relative to the south direction. The angles 'a' and 'b' are to be determined relative to the North direction at the "Current" and "Start" point, respectively.
- Perpendicularity: The North-South and East-West lines are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No explicit congruence or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The line segments intersect at a point representing the change of direction.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The given information and the implied triangle will be used to find the bearing from the "Current" location back to the "Start". The angles with respect to the North-South direction are crucial.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All relevant information is captured. The relationships between the sides and angles of the triangle can be established using the Law of Cosines and Sines. The bearings can be expressed using the calculated angles.
