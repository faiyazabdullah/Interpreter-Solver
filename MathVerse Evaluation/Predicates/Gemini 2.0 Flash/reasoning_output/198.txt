PROBLEM 198 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is an isosceles triangle with side length 13 and base length 10. Find the area of the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle.
- The triangle is isosceles with two sides of length 13.
- The base of the triangle has length 10.
- There is a dashed line from the top vertex to the base, indicating the height.
- The dashed line forms a right angle with the base, indicating it is the altitude.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the figure.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The dashed line forms a right angle with the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two sides of the triangle are equal with length 13.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The dashed line intersects the base at its midpoint.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height divides the isosceles triangle into two congruent right triangles.
- The base of each right triangle is 5.
- The height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The side lengths and base length are given.
- The height is perpendicular to the base.
- The triangle is isosceles.
- The predicates will provide enough information to calculate the area.
