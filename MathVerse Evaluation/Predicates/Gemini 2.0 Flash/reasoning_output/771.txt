PROBLEM 771 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, the circle with center O has radius 7, AB is a diameter, and AC = BC. What is the area of triangle ABC?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center O and points A, B, C on the circumference.
- AB is a line segment passing through the center O.
- AC and BC are line segments.
- There is a right angle at C.
- The length of AO is marked as 7.
- Triangle ABC is formed.
- AB is a diameter of the circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Point O is the center of the circle.
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.
- AB is a diameter.
- AO = OB = 7 (radius of the circle). Thus, AB = 14.
- OC is a radius.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ACB is a right angle.
- Line AC is perpendicular to line BC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AC = BC, thus triangle ABC is isosceles.
- AO = BO = 7. AB = AO + OB = 14.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point O is the midpoint of AB.
- Lines AC and BC intersect at point C.
- AB intersects the circle at A and B.
- OC intersects the circle at C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is the diameter and C is a point on the circle, angle ACB is a right angle. This confirms the presence of the right angle marking.
- Triangle ABC is a right isosceles triangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified that the radius of the circle is 7, therefore the diameter AB is 14. Triangle ABC is a right isosceles triangle. We know that AC=BC and Angle ACB is 90 degrees.
- The area of triangle ABC is (1/2) * AC * BC.
- Since triangle ABC is right-angled at C, C lies on the circle.
- AB is the hypotenuse of the triangle, and its length is the diameter of the circle = 14.
- Triangle ABC is isosceles with AC=BC. Thus, AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2  => 2*AC^2 = 14^2 = 196 => AC^2 = 98 => AC = sqrt(98) = 7*sqrt(2)
- The area of the triangle is (1/2) * 7*sqrt(2) * 7*sqrt(2) = (1/2) * 49 * 2 = 49.
