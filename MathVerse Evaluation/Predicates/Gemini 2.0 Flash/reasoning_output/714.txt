PROBLEM 714 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the prism shown. The bottom is a rectangular prism with edges of 6m, 5m and 10m. The top is a triangular prism. The marked edges are the same length.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a composite 3D shape. The bottom part is a rectangular prism and the top is a triangular prism.
- Points are implied at vertices.
- Measurements are given as 3m, 6m, 5m, and 10m.
- A right angle is indicated where the height of the triangle meets the base.
- Tick marks indicate that the two sides of the triangle are equal in length.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle on top is isosceles.
- The height of the isosceles triangle is perpendicular to its base.
- The rectangular prism has right angles at each vertex.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Two sides of the top triangle are congruent.
- The opposite faces of the rectangular prism are congruent.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The top triangular prism is placed directly on top of the rectangular prism, sharing an edge.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height of the triangular prism is perpendicular to the base, dividing it into two equal parts.
- The surface area can be calculated by finding the area of each face and adding them together.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the information needed to solve the surface area problem is available.
