PROBLEM 307 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot C, point R, M, N, L are on the circle, and M L is the diameter. \angle M C R = x - 1 degrees and \angle R C L = 3x + 5 degrees. Find m \angle R C M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center C.
- Points R, M, N, L lie on the circle.
- Line ML is a diameter of the circle.
- Angle MCR is labeled as (x-1) degrees.
- Angle RCL is labeled as (3x+5) degrees.
- Angle MCN is labeled as 60 degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- C is the center of the circle.
- CR, CM, CN, CL are radii of the circle.
- ML is a diameter, so it passes through the center C.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle MCL is a straight angle (180 degrees).
- Angles MCR and RCL are supplementary angles whose sum is 180 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- CR, CM, CN, CL are all equal since they are radii of the same circle.
- Angle MCN is 60 degrees.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point C is the intersection of radii and lies at the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of angles MCR and RCL equals 180 degrees because ML is a straight line. Thus, (x-1) + (3x+5) = 180.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is captured to set up the equation and solve for x, then find m<RCM.
