PROBLEM 648 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the sphere shown. The radius is 3 centimeters.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sphere.
- A line segment representing the radius of the sphere is shown with a length of 3 cm.
- A point is shown at the center of the sphere.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The sphere has a center.
- The line segment is a radius of the sphere.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are explicitly shown or marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius is given as 3 cm. All radii of a sphere are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The center of the sphere is the starting point of the radius.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula (4/3) * pi * r^3 where r is the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The radius of the sphere is given.
