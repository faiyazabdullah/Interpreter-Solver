PROBLEM 662 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the solid pictured and answer the following:

Hence what is the total surface area? The outer radius is 11 cm, inner radius is 10 cm and length 24 cm.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a hollow cylinder.
- The cylinder has an outer radius of 11 cm and an inner radius of 10 cm.
- The length of the cylinder is 24 cm.
- We need to find the total surface area.

STEP 2: SURFACE AREA CALCULATION
The total surface area of the hollow cylinder is the sum of the outer curved surface area, the inner curved surface area, and the areas of the two circular rings.
Outer curved surface area = 2 * pi * outer radius * length = 2 * pi * 11 * 24 = 528 * pi
Inner curved surface area = 2 * pi * inner radius * length = 2 * pi * 10 * 24 = 480 * pi
Area of each circular ring = pi * (outer radius^2 - inner radius^2) = pi * (11^2 - 10^2) = pi * (121 - 100) = 21 * pi
Area of two circular rings = 2 * 21 * pi = 42 * pi
Total surface area = 528 * pi + 480 * pi + 42 * pi = (528 + 480 + 42) * pi = 1050 * pi

STEP 3: FINAL CALCULATION
Total surface area = 1050 * pi ≈ 1050 * 3.14159265359 ≈ 3298.67228627
Rounding to two decimal places: 3298.67
