PROBLEM 664 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the sphere shown. The radius is 11 cm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shape: The image shows a sphere.
- Measurement: The radius of the sphere is given as 11 cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The diameter is represented by a dotted line within the circle. The radius is shown as a line from the center to the circumference.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The surface area of a sphere is given by the formula 4 * pi * r^2.  We have r = 11 cm.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the radius. We need to calculate the surface area using the formula.
