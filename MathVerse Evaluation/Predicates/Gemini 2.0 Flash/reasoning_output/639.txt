PROBLEM 639 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of a concrete pipe with outer radius 7 metres, inner radius 3 metres and length 13 metres. Write your answer correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a concrete pipe, which can be represented as a cylinder with a cylindrical hole inside.
- There are two circles, an outer circle with radius 7m and an inner circle with radius 3m.
- The length of the pipe is 13m.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The outer circle has radius 7m.
- The inner circle has radius 3m.
- The two circles are concentric, meaning they share the same center.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked angles or perpendicular relationships.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the outer circle is equal to 7m.
- The radius of the inner circle is equal to 3m.
- The length of the pipe is equal to 13m.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two circles share the same center.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the concrete pipe can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the inner cylinder from the volume of the outer cylinder.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the radii of the inner and outer circles, and the length of the pipe, which is all we need to calculate the volume.
