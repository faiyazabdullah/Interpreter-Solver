PROBLEM 312 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two triangles have a shared vertex with three annotated points A, B, and C. Find the measure of \angle 2 if A B \perp B C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two triangles that share a common vertex B. There are several angles labeled with degree measures, and a right angle mark is present at vertex B. The points are labeled A, B, and C. There are also angle numbers 1 through 8.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle 5 is a right angle. Angle 1 is supplementary to the 104-degree angle.
Angle 7 and the 40-degree angle are supplementary angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruent or equal shapes are marked in the diagram.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The lines intersect at various points, and the points define the triangles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The two lines that intersect to form angle 1 and the 104-degree angle are collinear. Similarly, the line that forms angle 7 and the 40-degree angle are also collinear. Also AB is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All angles and perpendicularity are captured. No congruent marks are visible. The diagram properties are captured.
