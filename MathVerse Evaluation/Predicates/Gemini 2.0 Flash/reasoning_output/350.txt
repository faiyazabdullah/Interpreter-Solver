PROBLEM 350 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A fighter jet, flying at an altitude of 2000 m is approaching a target. At a particular time the pilot measures the angle of depression to the target to be 13^\circ . After a minute, the pilot measures the angle of depression again and finds it to be 16^\circ .
Now find the distance covered by the jet in one minute.

Round your answer to the nearest meter.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains points A, B, C, and the location of the airport.
- There are lines AB, BC, and the vertical line from C to the airport.
- Two angles of depression are given: 13 degrees at A and 16 degrees at B.
- The altitude (height) is given as 2000 m.
- We assume that line AC is the horizontal line where the jet flies.
- The line from C to the airport is perpendicular to line AC. Therefore, triangle with vertices at C, the airport, and B is a right triangle.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle of depression at A is 13 degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the line from A to the airport and the horizontal line is 13 degrees.
- The angle of depression at B is 16 degrees.  Therefore, the angle between the line from B to the airport and the horizontal line is 16 degrees.
- The angle at C in the triangle formed by the airport and point C is a right angle (90 degrees).

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The horizontal distance from C to A and C to B are adjacent to the 2000 m height and related to angles 13 and 16 degrees.
