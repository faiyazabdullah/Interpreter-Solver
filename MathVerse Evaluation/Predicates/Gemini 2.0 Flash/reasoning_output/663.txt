PROBLEM 663 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Write an equation for the surface area of the above cylinder if the length is $L$, the major radius $R$ and minor radius $r$. You must factorise this expression fully.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a hollow cylinder.
- The cylinder has length L, major radius R, and minor radius r.
- The ends of the cylinder are circular.

STEP 2: DERIVATION OF SURFACE AREA

- The surface area of the hollow cylinder can be thought of as the sum of the outer curved surface area, the inner curved surface area, and the areas of the two ends.
- The outer curved surface area is 2 * pi * R * L.
- The inner curved surface area is 2 * pi * r * L.
- The area of each end is the area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner circle, which is pi * R^2 - pi * r^2.  Since there are two ends, the total area is 2 * (pi * R^2 - pi * r^2).
- Thus, the total surface area is 2 * pi * R * L + 2 * pi * r * L + 2 * (pi * R^2 - pi * r^2).
- This simplifies to 2 * pi * R * L + 2 * pi * r * L + 2 * pi * R^2 - 2 * pi * r^2
- Factoring out 2 * pi gives: 2 * pi * (R * L + r * L + R^2 - r^2)
- Factoring by grouping: 2 * pi * (L * (R + r) + (R - r) * (R + r))
- Fully factorised surface area: 2 * pi * (R + r) * (L + R - r)
