PROBLEM 364 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A suspension bridge is being built. The top of the concrete tower is 35.5 metres above the bridge and the connection point for the main cable is 65.9 metres from the tower.

Assume that the concrete tower and the bridge are perpendicular to each other.

If the length of the cable is h metres, find h to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify all geometric shapes: The image shows a diagram of a suspension bridge. There's a tower, a bridge surface, and a cable. The tower is represented as a vertical line, and the bridge as a horizontal line. The cable forms two hypotenuses. A right triangle is formed implicitly by the tower and half the distance of the cable connection.
- List all points, lines, and their labels/names: The tower has a height of 35.5 m, the distance from the tower to the cable connection point is 65.9 m / 2, and the cable length is 'h'.
- Note all visible measurements, angles, and numerical values: We have 35.5 m (tower height), 65.9 m (distance between cable connection points), and we are looking for 'h' (cable length).
- Identify all special markings: The diagram suggests a right angle between the tower and the bridge.
- Identify all implied constructions: A right triangle can be inferred with the tower as one leg, half the distance between cable connection points as the other leg, and the cable as the hypotenuse.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The tower and the bridge are perpendicular, forming a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- By symmetry, the two right triangles formed on either side of the tower are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The tower and the bridge surface intersect. The cable connects to the tower at its top and to the bridge surface at two points equidistant from the tower.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The Pythagorean theorem can be applied to find the length of the cable ('h'): h^2 = (35.5)^2 + (65.9/2)^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The relationships are captured using predicates that define the right angle and the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle. These are sufficient to calculate h.
