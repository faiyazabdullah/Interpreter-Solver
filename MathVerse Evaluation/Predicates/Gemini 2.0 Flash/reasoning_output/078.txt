PROBLEM 078 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, AE bisects angle CAB and CD at point E, if angle C = 70.0, then the degree of angle AED is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: The image shows lines, angles, and implies a triangle.
- List points: A, B, C, D, E
- List lines: AB, CD, AE
- Measurements: Angle C = 70 degrees
- Markings: AB is parallel to CD, AE bisects angle CAB

STEP 2: ANGLE ANALYSIS
- Angle C is given as 70 degrees.
- AE bisects angle CAB, implying angle CAE = angle EAB.
- AB is parallel to CD, which implies angle CAB + angle ACE = 180 degrees (same-side interior angles are supplementary).
- Since AB is parallel to CD, angle AED and angle EAB are alternate interior angles and therefore equal if a transversal cuts across them.
- Angle AED and Angle C are interior angles of the same side with transversal CE. They are supplementary.
- We need to find angle AED.

STEP 3: RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is parallel to CD, angle CAB + angle C = 180.
- Angle CAB = 180 - 70 = 110.
- Since AE bisects angle CAB, angle CAE = 110 / 2 = 55.
- Because AB is parallel to CD, angle CAE + angle AED = 180, so angle AED + Angle EAB
- Angle AED is an exterior angle of the triangle ACE, so AED = angle C + angle CAE.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to relate angle AED to the given angle C.
- We have identified parallel lines, angle bisector, and supplementary angles.
