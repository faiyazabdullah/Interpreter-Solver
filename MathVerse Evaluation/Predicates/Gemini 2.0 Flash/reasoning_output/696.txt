PROBLEM 696 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the figure shown, correct to two decimal places. The inner cylinder has a radius of 4 cm and the outer cylinder has a radius of 9 cm. The height of both cylinders is 2 cm.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure is composed of two cylinders, one smaller and one larger, stacked on top of each other.
- The smaller cylinder has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 2 cm.
- The larger cylinder has a radius of 9 cm and a height of 2 cm.
- We need to find the total volume of the two cylinders combined.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base and top of each cylinder are circles.
- Radius of the smaller cylinder's circle is 4 cm.
- Radius of the larger cylinder's circle is 9 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The cylinders are upright, so the height is perpendicular to the circular base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The height of both cylinders is equal, which is 2 cm.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The center of the smaller cylinder is positioned on top of the center of the larger cylinder.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of each cylinder can be calculated using the formula V = πr²h.
- The total volume is the sum of the volume of the smaller cylinder and the larger cylinder.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all necessary information to calculate the volume of each cylinder and the total volume.
