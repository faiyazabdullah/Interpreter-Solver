PROBLEM 377 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 60^\circ, the hypotenuse measures 9. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown a.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right-angled triangle.
- The vertices of the triangle are not explicitly labeled, so we'll refer to the sides by their lengths.
- One angle is a right angle (90 degrees).
- Another angle is 60 degrees.
- The hypotenuse has a length of 9.
- One leg of the triangle has a length denoted as 'a'.
- The triangle is a 30-60-90 triangle.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle in the triangle.
- There is an angle of 60 degrees.
- The remaining angle is 30 degrees.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The length of the hypotenuse is 9.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The triangle is a right triangle, so the Pythagorean theorem applies.
- The angles of the triangle sum to 180 degrees.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the value of 'a'.
- We know the hypotenuse and one angle.
