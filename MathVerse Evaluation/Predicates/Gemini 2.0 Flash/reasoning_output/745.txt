PROBLEM 745 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cylinder.
- The cylinder has a height of 13 and a diameter of 3.
- There is a line segment L from the bottom of the cylinder to the top. This is assumed to be the longest straw.
- We can assume the straw makes the hypotenuse of a right triangle, with the height of the cylinder as one leg, and the diameter as the other leg.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The diameter of the circular base is 3.
- We can assume that the height is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We can assume a right angle between the height of the cylinder and the diameter.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cylinder is 13.
- The diameter is 3.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line segment L connects the bottom point of the circle to the top point of the circle, forming a hypotenuse.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The length of the straw L, the height of the cylinder, and the diameter form a right triangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information.
