PROBLEM 485 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a curve start from a solid point (1,0) with an end arrow going through (-4,4). Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a curve starting from the point (1,0) and going towards the left with an arrow at the end. The arrow end is passing through the point (-4,4). The curve decreases as x increases from 1 towards negative infinity.

STEP 2: Identify the domain and range
The domain starts at x=1, includes 1, and goes to negative infinity.
The range starts at y=0, includes 0, and goes to positive infinity.
