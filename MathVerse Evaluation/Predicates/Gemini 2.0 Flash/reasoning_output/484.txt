PROBLEM 484 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a curve goes through (-5,2), (-1,0), and (3,2). The point at (-5,2) and (3,2) are respectively solid and hollow. Write the domain and range of the function using interval notation.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a curve in a coordinate system.
- The curve passes through the points (-5, 2), (-1, 0), and (3, 2).
- The point at x=-5 has a solid circle, indicating it is included in the function's graph.
- The point at x=3 has a hollow circle, indicating it is excluded from the function's graph.
- The x-axis ranges from -5 to 5, and the y-axis ranges from -5 to 5.
- The curve has a minimum value of y = 0.

STEP 2: DOMAIN AND RANGE DETERMINATION
- Domain: The x-values for which the function is defined. Based on the graph, the function is defined for x values from -5 (inclusive) to 3 (exclusive). In interval notation, this is [-5, 3).
- Range: The y-values that the function takes. The minimum y-value is 0. The maximum y-value is 2, which is attained at x = -5. The y-value approaches, but does not reach, 2 at x = 3. Therefore, the range is [0, 2].

STEP 3: REPRESENTATION AS GEOMETRIC PREDICATES
- Points: We identify the points where the curve crosses the given grid lines. We explicitly represent some of them to show where the domain and range start and end.
