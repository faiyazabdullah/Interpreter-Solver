PROBLEM 762 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, the length of CD is 7, the length of CF is 15, and CDEF is a rectangle. If the area of triangle CAF is equal to the area of rectangle CDEF, what is the length of segment AD?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Rectangle CDEF, Triangle CAF, Triangle ADE.
- Points: A, D, C, F, E.
- Lines: AD, DE, EC, CF, FA, AC, AE.
- Measurements: CD = 7, CF = 15.
- Special markings: Right angles at D, C, and E in the rectangle CDEF. Right angle at C in triangle CAF.
- Implied constructions: DE is parallel to CF and DC is parallel to EF since CDEF is a rectangle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ADC is a right angle. Angle DCF is a right angle. Angle DEF is a right angle. Angle CFE is a right angle. Angle ACF is a right angle.
- AD is perpendicular to DC. DC is perpendicular to CF. CF is perpendicular to FE. FE is perpendicular to ED. DE is perpendicular to AD. AC is perpendicular to CF.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- CD = EF = 7
- CF = DE = 15
- Area of triangle CAF = Area of rectangle CDEF

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AD and DE intersect at D. Lines DE and EF intersect at E. Lines EF and CF intersect at F. Lines CF and CD intersect at C.
- Lines AC and CF intersect at C. Line AF intersects DE.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- CDEF is a rectangle.
- Area of rectangle CDEF = CD * CF
- Area of triangle CAF = (1/2) * CF * AC
- Given area of triangle CAF = area of rectangle CDEF. Therefore (1/2) * CF * AC = CD * CF, so (1/2) * AC = CD, which implies AC = 2 * CD = 2 * 7 = 14
- Triangle ADC is a right triangle. Using Pythagorean theorem, AC^2 = AD^2 + DC^2. Substituting the value of AC = 14 and DC = 7, 14^2 = AD^2 + 7^2, so 196 = AD^2 + 49, and AD^2 = 147. Thus AD = sqrt(147) = 7 * sqrt(3).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
