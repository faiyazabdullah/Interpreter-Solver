PROBLEM 538 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(\frac{3}{5} \pi, 8\right)$ and again at $\left(\frac{7}{5} \pi, 8\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph of a trigonometric function. Two points on the midline are given: $(\frac{3}{5}\pi, 8)$ and $(\frac{7}{5}\pi, 8)$. The problem asks for the period of the function.

STEP 2: IDENTIFY RELATIONSHIPS
The two given points have the same y-value, so the distance between their x-values represents half the period of the function since they intersect the midline. The distance between $\frac{3}{5}\pi$ and $\frac{7}{5}\pi$ is $\frac{7}{5}\pi - \frac{3}{5}\pi = \frac{4}{5}\pi$. Since the period is twice this distance, the period is $2 \cdot \frac{4}{5}\pi = \frac{8}{5}\pi$.

STEP 3: GENERATE GEOMETRIC PREDICATES

```
Point(A)
Point(B)
A = (3/5*pi,8)
B = (7/5*pi,8)
```
PERIOD ANALYSIS:
The points A and B are $(\frac{3}{5}\pi, 8)$ and $(\frac{7}{5}\pi, 8)$, respectively. They lie on the midline.
The distance between their x-coordinates represents half the period.
The difference in x-coordinates is $\frac{7}{5}\pi - \frac{3}{5}\pi = \frac{4}{5}\pi$. The period is twice that amount, so $\frac{8}{5}\pi$.

```
Equals(A,(3/5*pi,8))
Equals(B,(7/5*pi,8))
```

PREDICATES:
```
Point(A)
Point(B)
Equals(A,(Mul(Div(3,5),pi),8))
Equals(B,(Mul(Div(7,5),pi),8))
```
