PROBLEM 659 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the height $h$ mm of this closed cylinder if its surface area (S) is 27288(mm)^2 and the radius (r) of its circular faces is 43mm.

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a closed cylinder.
- The radius of the circular base is 43mm.
- The height of the cylinder is 'h' mm.
- The surface area of the cylinder is 27288 mm^2.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The cylinder has two circular faces.
- The diameter of each circular face is 2 * 43mm = 86mm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two circular faces are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable for this image.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The surface area of a closed cylinder is given by S = 2 * pi * r^2 + 2 * pi * r * h.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the surface area S and the radius r.
- We need to find the height h.
