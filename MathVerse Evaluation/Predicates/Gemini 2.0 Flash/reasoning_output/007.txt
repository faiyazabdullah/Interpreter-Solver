PROBLEM 007 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, triangle ABC congruent triangle ADE, Point A is their common vertex. if angle B = 70.0, angle C = 30.0, angle DAC = 35.0, then the degree of angle EAC is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes: Triangles ABC, ADE
- List ALL points: A, B, C, D, E
- Note ALL visible measurements: angle B = 70 degrees, angle C = 30 degrees, angle DAC = 35 degrees
- Identify ALL special markings: Congruent triangles ABC and ADE. Point A is their common vertex.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS (If circles are present)
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle B = 70.0
- Angle C = 30.0
- Angle DAC = 35.0
- Angle BAC = 180 - Angle B - Angle C = 180 - 70 - 30 = 80 degrees.
- Angle BAE = Angle BAC since Triangle ABC is congruent to Triangle ADE, therefore angle BAE = 80 degrees
- Angle DAE = Angle C = 30 degrees
- Angle BAD = Angle BAC - Angle DAC = 80 - 35 = 45 degrees
- Angle CAE = Angle BAE - Angle BAC = 80 degrees

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Triangle ABC congruent Triangle ADE

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at point D
- Lines intersect at point A
- Lines intersect at point E

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC congruent Triangle ADE, Angle B = 70.0, Angle C = 30.0, Angle DAC = 35.0.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
-Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured
-Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented
-Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed
-Confirm that the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving
