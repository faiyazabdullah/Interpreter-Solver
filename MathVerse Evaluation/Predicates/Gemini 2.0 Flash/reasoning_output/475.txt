PROBLEM 475 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a point at 4 and a blue arrow goes to left from that point. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a number line.
- There is a point at 4 on the number line.
- A blue arrow extends to the left from the point at 4.
- The arrow indicates that the numbers less than or equal to 4 are included.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no angles or perpendicular relationships in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no congruent or equal shapes in the diagram.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The point at 4 lies on the number line.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The blue arrow extending to the left from the point at 4 represents the set of all numbers less than or equal to 4.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The analysis captures all information needed to solve the problem.

PREDICATES:
Point(4)
PointLiesOnLine(Point(4),Line($1,$2))
Blue(Line($3,$4))
LengthOf(Line($3,$4))
