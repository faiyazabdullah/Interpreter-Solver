PROBLEM 603 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

Who is traveling faster?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The graph shows two lines representing the distance traveled by Oliver and Justin over time.
- The x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.
- We can see that Oliver covers a longer distance in the same amount of time as Justin.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Both lines start from the origin, meaning at time 0, both racers have traveled 0 distance.
- The slope of Oliver's line is steeper than Justin's line.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Since Oliver's line has a steeper slope, it indicates that Oliver is traveling at a faster speed than Justin.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The black line represents Oliver and the gray line represents Justin.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Oliver's distance at time 5 is greater than Justin's distance at time 5.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates below will represent the lines and the relative progress of Oliver and Justin.
