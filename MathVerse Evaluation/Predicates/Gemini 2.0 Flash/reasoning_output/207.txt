PROBLEM 207 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two small circles are inscribed to the biggest circle. The diameter of the biggest circle is 20. Find the area of the shaded region. Round to the nearest tenth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a large circle with two smaller circles inscribed within it.
- The two smaller circles are tangent to each other at the center of the larger circle and tangent to the larger circle.
- The diameter of the large circle is labeled as 20.
- The figure is shaded outside the two smaller circles.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Let the large circle be C1. Let the two smaller circles be C2 and C3.
- The diameter of C1 is 20, so its radius is 10.
- Since the two smaller circles are tangent at the center of the large circle and tangent to the large circle, their diameters must be equal to the radius of the large circle. So, diameter of C2 and C3 are both 10, and their radii are 5.
- Let the center of C1 be O. The centers of C2 and C3 also lie on the diameter of C1.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable in this case.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two smaller circles are congruent since their radii are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two smaller circles intersect at the center of the larger circle.
- The two smaller circles are tangent to the larger circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The diameter of the big circle is the sum of the diameters of the two small circles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image displays the diameter of the large circle, and the relationships between the circles are clear.
- The area of shaded region = area of big circle - area of two small circles.
- Area of circle = pi * r^2

```text
Area of large circle = pi * 10^2 = 100pi
Area of small circle = pi * 5^2 = 25pi
Area of two small circles = 2 * 25pi = 50pi
Area of shaded region = 100pi - 50pi = 50pi = 50 * 3.14 = 157.08
```
