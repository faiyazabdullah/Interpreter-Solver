PROBLEM 414 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of the figure is $5\mathrm{~cm}$. Find the area of the sector shown.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a sector of a circle.
- There are lines forming an angle.
- A measurement of the radius is given as 5 cm.
- The angle of the missing sector is given as 23 degrees.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 5 cm.
- We are dealing with a sector of a circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle of the missing sector is 23 degrees.
- The angle of the sector shown is 360 - 23 = 337 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two radii of the circle are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of a sector is proportional to the angle it subtends at the center.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information needed to find the area of the sector.
