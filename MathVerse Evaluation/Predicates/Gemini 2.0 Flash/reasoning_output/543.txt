PROBLEM 543 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: $f$ is a trigonometric function of the form $f(x)=a \cos (b x+c)+d$.
Below is the graph of $f(x)$. The function has a maximum point at $(-2,-3)$ and a minimum point at $(-2.5,-9)$. Find a formula for $f(x)$. Give an exact expression.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows the graph of a trigonometric function. The function has a maximum point at (-2,-3) and a minimum point at (-2.5,-9). The graph oscillates between y = -3 and y = -9. The graph appears to be a cosine function.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no angles or perpendicular relationships shown in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The maximum and minimum points are given.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The maximum point is at (-2,-3) and the minimum point is at (-2.5,-9).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The function is of the form f(x) = a cos(bx+c) + d.
The maximum value of the function is -3 and the minimum value is -9. Therefore, the amplitude is A = (-3 - (-9))/2 = 3.
The vertical shift is d = (-3 + (-9))/2 = -6.
Therefore, f(x) = 3 cos(bx+c) - 6.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The information captured is enough to solve the problem.
