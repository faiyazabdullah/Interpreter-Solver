PROBLEM 168 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in the plane rectangular coordinate system, the coordinates of point A are (2.0,3.0), then the value of tanα is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a plane rectangular coordinate system.
- Point A has coordinates (2, 3).
- There is a right triangle formed by the axes and a line segment from the origin to point A.
- Angle α is formed between the x-axis and the line segment from the origin to point A.
- The horizontal leg of the triangle has length 2.
- The vertical leg of the triangle has length 3.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle α is formed between the x-axis and the line segment OA.
- There is a right angle formed by the x-axis and the vertical line segment from point A.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality is marked. We have lengths 2 and 3.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point A is at (2, 3).
- The origin is at (0, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- tan(α) = opposite/adjacent = 3/2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information to represent the diagram.
