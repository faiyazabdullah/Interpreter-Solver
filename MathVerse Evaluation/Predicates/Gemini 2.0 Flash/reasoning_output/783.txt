PROBLEM 783 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The degrees of each angle are shown in the figure, two of the angles are the same and both are x. If x = 20 and y = 30 in the figure above, what is the value of z?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure appears to be a quadrilateral with angles labeled as x, y, and z.
- The angle with label 'y' has a value of 30 degrees relative to a vertical line. The angle with label 'x' has a value of 20 degrees relative to a horizontal line. There are two angles labeled x.
- The shape is not drawn to scale as indicated in the note.
- I need to find relationships between the angles to determine a correct equation and identify the final value of z.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angles x, y, and z are interior angles within the figure.
- The external angle to y is 30 degrees, so y = 180 - 30 = 150 degrees.
- The external angle to x is 20 degrees, so x = 180 - 20 = 160 degrees.
- Since x = 20 is directly given, this represents an error.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Two angles are equal and labeled x. It's given that x = 20 and y = 30.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The figure can be viewed as a quadrilateral.
The sum of interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees. Therefore, x + x + y + z = 360.
We are given x = 20 and y = 30. Substituting, we get 20 + 20 + 30 + z = 360.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
I have identified all given angles and the constraint equation, and I know the problem is asking to find the value of z.

PREDICATES:
Angle(x)
Angle(y)
Angle(z)
Equals(x,20)
Equals(y,30)
Equals(SumOf(x,x,y,z),360)
