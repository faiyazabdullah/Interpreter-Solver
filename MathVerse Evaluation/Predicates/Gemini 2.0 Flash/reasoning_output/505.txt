PROBLEM 505 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Write an equation for the transformation of f(x)=|x| as shown in the figure, which passes (-2, 1) and are piecewise.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure shows a transformation of f(x)=|x|.
- There are two line segments joined at a point.
- The two line segments appear to form a V shape.
- The vertex of the V is at (-2,1).
- The right side of the V passes through (0,2).
- The left side of the V passes through (-4,2).
- The x and y axis are labeled.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are marked, and no perpendicularities are indicated.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two line segments are not necessarily congruent.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The point (-2,1) appears to be the vertex of the absolute value function.
- The point (0,2) lies on the right line segment.
- The point (-4,2) lies on the left line segment.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The basic shape is a transformation of the absolute value function. It is translated and may also be stretched or compressed.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to capture the relationship between the two line segments and their intersection.

STEP 7: DERIVING EQUATION

Let f(x) = a|x-h| + k. The vertex is at (h, k).
The vertex is at (-2, 1), so h = -2 and k = 1. Therefore, f(x) = a|x+2| + 1.
We are given the point (0, 2) is on the graph. Substitute x=0, y=2:
2 = a|0+2| + 1
2 = 2a + 1
1 = 2a
a = 1/2
Therefore, the function is f(x) = (1/2)|x+2| + 1

We are given the graph has two line segments which are piecewise.
The vertex is at x=-2
f(x) =
{
-(1/2)(x+2) + 1 if x < -2
(1/2)(x+2) + 1 if x >= -2
}
f(x) =
{
-(1/2)x - 1 + 1 if x < -2
(1/2)x + 1 + 1 if x >= -2
}

f(x) =
{
-(1/2)x if x < -2
(1/2)x + 2 if x >= -2
}
