PROBLEM 661 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the cylinder shown. The height is 10 cm and radius is 6 cm.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cylinder.
- The radius of the circular base is 6 cm.
- The height of the cylinder is 10 cm.

STEP 2: CYLINDER SURFACE AREA CALCULATION
- The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula: 2πr^2 + 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height.
- Here, r = 6 cm and h = 10 cm.
- Surface area = 2π(6^2) + 2π(6)(10) = 2π(36) + 2π(60) = 72π + 120π = 192π.
- Surface area ≈ 192 * 3.14159265359 ≈ 603.185789489
- To the nearest two decimal places, the surface area is 603.19 cm^2.

STEP 3: PREDICATE GENERATION

Geometric predicates:
```
Circle(1)
LengthOf(radius)=6
LengthOf(height)=10
IsRadiusOf(radius,Circle(1))
