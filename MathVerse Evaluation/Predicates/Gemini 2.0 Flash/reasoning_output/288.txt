PROBLEM 288 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a right triangle A B F on top of a rectangle C D E F. \angle C F D is labeled as \angle 2. Find m \angle 2.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: The image contains a right triangle ABF on top of a rectangle CDEF.
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Lines: AB, BF, FA, BC, CD, DE, EF, FC, FD
- Angles: Angle 1, 48 degrees at B, 39 degrees at D, and right angles at F, C, and E
- Measurements: 48 degrees, 39 degrees
- Special Markings: Right angle symbols at F, C, and E, parallel marks on BC and DE, and FC and ED.
- Implied Constructions: Triangle ABF and rectangle CDEF

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AFB is a right angle (90 degrees).
- Angle CDE is not marked, but rectangle implies it is right angle (90 degrees).
- Angle EFA is not marked but rectangle implies it is right angle (90 degrees).
- Angle BCD is not marked, but rectangle implies it is right angle (90 degrees).
- Angle 1 and angle ABF are complementary angles in triangle ABF.
- Angle 3 and angle EDF are complementary, where EDF is 39.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- BC is parallel to DE, FC is parallel to ED.
- EF = CD, FC = DE.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point F is where AF and FE meet.
- Point E is where DE and EF meet.
- Point D is where CD and DE meet.
- Point C is where BC and CD meet.
- Line FD intersects line BC.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABF is a right triangle.
- Quadrilateral CDEF is a rectangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured
- Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented
- Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed
- Confirm that the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving
