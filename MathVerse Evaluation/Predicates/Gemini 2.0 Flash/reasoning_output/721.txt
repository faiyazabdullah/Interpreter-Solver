PROBLEM 721 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the rectangular prism shown with its height is 12m and the length of its base is $(x+4)m$ and $(x+8)m$ respectively.

Write a fully expanded and simplified expression for the volume of the prism.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: Rectangular prism
- List points: No points are explicitly labeled
- List lines: Lines that define the rectangular prism's edges.
- Note measurements: height = 12m, base length = (x+4)m, base width = (x+8)m
- Special markings: None.
- Implied constructions: The edges of the rectangular prism meet at right angles.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not Applicable

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangular prism has right angles at its vertices, where the edges meet.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Opposite faces of the prism are congruent rectangles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Edges intersect at vertices.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Volume of rectangular prism = length * width * height
- Volume = (x+4)(x+8)(12)

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information needed to define the rectangular prism and express its volume is captured.
