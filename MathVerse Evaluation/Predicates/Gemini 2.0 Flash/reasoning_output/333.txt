PROBLEM 333 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 37Â°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes (circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.)
Points: P, M, S
Lines: Line(M,S), Line(M,P)
Angles: Angle PMS
Measurements: Angle between North and line MP is 323 degrees.
Angle PMS is 37 degrees.
Line MS represents the South direction from point M.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS (If circles are present)
A red circle is present with center near point M.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle between the North and South direction is 180 degrees. The angle between East and West direction is 180 degrees. The angle between the North and East direction is 90 degrees. The angle between the South and West direction is 90 degrees.
The angle between MS and the north direction is 180 degrees.
The angle from north clockwise to line MP is 323 degrees.
The angle PMS is given as 37 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent shapes or equal lengths are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line MP and MS intersect at point M.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
-The angle from North to MP is 323 degrees. This can be broken into a sum of angles. The angle from North to South is 180. The angle from South to MP is then 323-180 = 143 degrees.
The angle PMS is 37 degrees.
Therefore, the bearing of P from M can be calculated using these two angles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
-The predicates capture the essential elements and relationships for determining the bearing of P from M.
