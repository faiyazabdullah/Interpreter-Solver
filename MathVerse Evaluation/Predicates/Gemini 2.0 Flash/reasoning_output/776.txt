PROBLEM 776 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above. The graph consists of four lines l,m,n,p intersecting each other. Line l and line p are perpendicular. If the angle (not shown) where lines n and p intersect is twice as large as the angle (also not shown) where lines l and m intersect, what is the value of x?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows four lines: l, m, n, and p.
- Lines l and p are perpendicular.
- One angle is labeled as 90 degrees, and another is labeled as 110 degrees.
- An angle x is formed by the intersection of lines l and n.
- The angle where lines n and p intersect is twice as large as the angle where lines l and m intersect.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Line l and line p are perpendicular, forming a right angle.
- The angle between lines n and p is 110 degrees.  The adjacent angle is 180 - 110 = 70 degrees.
- The angle between lines l and m is not directly given.
- We are given that the angle between lines n and p is twice the angle between lines l and m.
Therefore, angle (n,p) = 2 * angle (l,m), or 70 = 2 * angle(l,m).  This means angle(l,m) = 35.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We know lines l and p are perpendicular.
- We know an angle is 110 degrees, therefore the adjacent angle is 70 degrees.
- We also know that 70 = 2 * angle(l,m), therefore angle(l,m) = 35.
- We are trying to find the value of x.
