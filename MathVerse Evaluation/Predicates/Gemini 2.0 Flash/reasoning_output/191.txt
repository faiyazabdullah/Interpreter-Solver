PROBLEM 191 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, points A, B, and C are on circle O, and the tangent line of circle O passing through point A intersects the extended line of OC at point P, angle B = 30.0, OP = 3.0, then the length of AP is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a circle, a triangle, and line segments.
- Points: A, B, C, O, P
- Lines: AB, BC, OC, OP, PA, OA
- Angles: Angle B = 30 degrees
- Measurement: OC = 3
- AP is tangent to the circle at point A.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle O is present
- Points A, B, and C lie on circle O.
- OA is a radius.
- OC is a line segment.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle B is 30 degrees.
- AP is tangent to the circle O at point A, so OA is perpendicular to AP. Therefore, angle OAP is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA and OB are radii, so OA = OB.
- Triangle OAB is isosceles because OA=OB

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point A lies on the circle O and line AP.
- Point B lies on the circle O and line segment BC.
- Point C lies on line segment OP.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since OA=OB, triangle OAB is isosceles, meaning angle OAB = angle OBA = 30 degrees.
- Angle AOB = 180 - (30 + 30) = 120 degrees.
- Since OA is perpendicular to AP, triangle OAP is a right triangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the relevant points, lines, angles, and shapes.
- We have also noted the given measurement OC = 3.
- The relationship between the tangent and the radius is also identified.
- The angle B = 30 degrees is identified.
