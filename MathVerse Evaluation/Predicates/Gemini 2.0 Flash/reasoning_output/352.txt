PROBLEM 352 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: From the cockpit of an aeroplane flying at an altitude of 3000 m, the angle of depression to the airport is 57°. The aeroplane continues to fly in the same straight line, and after a few minutes the angle of depression to the airport becomes 67°.
Now find the distance between the two sightings.

Round your answer to the nearest metre.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes (circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.)
Two triangles are formed: a smaller right triangle on the right and a larger right triangle on the left.
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names
The diagram includes a vertical line with length 3000m. Let's name the top left point A, the top right point B, and the bottom point C (airport).
The distance between A and B is x, and the distance from B to the line with length 3000 is y.
Angles of depression are given as 57 and 67 degrees.
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values
Vertical height = 3000 m
Angles of depression = 57 degrees and 67 degrees
Distances = x and y
- Identify ALL special markings (right angle symbols, parallel marks, congruent marks, equal marks, etc.)
Right angle at the airport.
- Look for implied constructions (perpendiculars, bisectors, tangents, chords, radii, etc.)
The vertical height is perpendicular to the horizontal line AB. The angles of depression are relative to a horizontal line.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS (If circles are present)
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Examine ALL angles shown in the diagram, both marked and unmarked
Angles of depression are 57 and 67 degrees. Since they are angles of depression, alternate interior angles are equal. Therefore, the angles at the airport C are 57 and 67 degrees.
- Look for right angle indicators or perpendicular relationships
Right angle at the airport.
- Check for angle bisectors or special angle relationships
No angle bisectors.
- Identify complementary, supplementary, or vertical angles
No explicit supplementary angles. Complementary angles can be calculated within each right triangle.
- Look for inscribed angles and their corresponding arcs
No inscribed angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL equal lengths, angles, or shapes (look for tick marks, identical measurements)
No directly equal lengths or shapes are marked.
- Check for congruent triangles or similar figures
No congruent or similar triangles marked.
- Look for equal radii in circles
No circles.
- Identify parallel lines or equal distances
Implied parallel horizontal lines from the airplanes to the horizontal line with length x + y.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Determine where lines intersect and at what points
Lines intersect at the top (points A and B), and at the airport (point C).
- Check if points lie on specific lines or circles
No circles.
- Identify midpoints, centroids, or other special points
No midpoints or other special points marked.
- Look for points that divide segments in specific ratios
No division ratios.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Combine observations to identify implicit relationships
Two right triangles share a common side (3000m). The angles and sides are related through trigonometric functions. x and y represent parts of the base of those right triangles.
- Look for theorem applications (Pythagorean, inscribed angle, etc.)
The Pythagorean theorem is applicable, but not immediately necessary.
SOH CAH TOA can be applied.
- Identify geometric constructions that create specific relationships
No explicit constructions are marked.
- Check for properties that follow from the given constraints
Relationships can be established between height, base, and angles using tan.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured
The diagram provides enough information to relate the lengths of the sides to the angles using tan. x is the difference between the two horizontal lengths.
- Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented
Two right triangles with one shared side. Angles are given. x and y are lengths of horizontal lines.
- Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed
Right angle, angles of depression.
- Confirm that the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving
The predicates should express right triangles and the relationships of trigonometric ratios.
