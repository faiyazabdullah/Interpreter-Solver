PROBLEM 375 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is 45Â°, the lengths of the two right angled edges are 4*sqrt{3} and y respectively, and the diagonal side has a length of x. Consider the adjacent figure:


Solve for the exact value of x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right-angled triangle.
- The vertices of the triangle are not labeled. Let's call them A, B, and C, where angle B is the right angle.
- The side opposite to vertex A has length y. The side opposite to vertex C has length 4*sqrt(3). The side opposite to vertex B has length x.
- Angle A is marked as 45 degrees.
- Angle B is a right angle.
- Angle C is 180 - 90 - 45 = 45 degrees.
- The triangle is an isosceles right triangle since angles A and C are equal.
- Therefore, sides AB and BC are equal.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle A is 45 degrees.
- Angle B is 90 degrees.
- Angle C is 45 degrees.
- Side AB is perpendicular to side BC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Since angle A and angle C are equal, side AB has the same length as side BC.
- Therefore, y = 4*sqrt(3)

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides intersect at the vertices of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Pythagorean theorem: x^2 = (4*sqrt(3))^2 + y^2 = (4*sqrt(3))^2 + (4*sqrt(3))^2 = 2*(4*sqrt(3))^2
- x = sqrt(2*(4*sqrt(3))^2) = 4*sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) = 4*sqrt(6)

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates will include all information to solve the problem.
