PROBLEM 767 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In rectangle ABDF above, point C lies on side BD,point E lies on side DF, C and E are midpoints of sides BD and DF, respectively. What fraction of the area of the rectangle is shaded?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle ABDF.
- Point C lies on BD, and point E lies on DF.
- C and E are midpoints of BD and DF respectively.
- The shaded area is quadrilateral ACEF and triangle ABC.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Rectangle ABDF implies right angles at A, B, D, and F.
- Therefore, AB is perpendicular to AF, BD is perpendicular to AB, DF is perpendicular to AF, and DF is perpendicular to BD.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- C is the midpoint of BD implies BC = CD.
- E is the midpoint of DF implies DE = EF.
- Opposite sides of rectangle are equal: AB = DF, BD = AF.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- C lies on line BD.
- E lies on line DF.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since C and E are midpoints of BD and DF, we have BC = CD and DE = EF.
- Since ABDF is a rectangle, we have AB = DF and BD = AF, and Angle(ABF) = Angle(BDF) = Angle(DFA) = Angle(FAB) = 90 degrees.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The above analysis seems sufficient to derive relationships and calculate areas if needed.
