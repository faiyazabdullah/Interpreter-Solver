PROBLEM 331 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the points on the diagram P, A and N where N denotes the north cardinal point. Angle PAN is 45°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from A.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image contains points, lines and angles.
- Points: The points are labeled P, A and N
- Lines: There are two lines, Line(A,P) and Line(A,N)
- Angles: There is an angle labeled 45°
- Cardinal direction: N represents the north cardinal direction.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle PAN is 45°.
- Line AN represents the North direction which can be considered as a vertical line.
- Bearing is measured clockwise from the North direction.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality is marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines PA and NA intersect at point A.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Bearing of P from A is 360 - Angle PAN

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should include: Points, lines, angle and measurement of angle PAN.

PREDICATES:
Point(P)
Point(A)
Point(N)
Line(A,P)
Line(A,N)
MeasureOf(Angle(P,A,N))
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(P,A,N)),45)
