PROBLEM 332 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the points on the diagram P, M and S where S denotes the south cardinal point. Angle PMS is 50°.

Using the diagram, find the true bearing of P from M.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: Lines, angles.
- List points: P, M, S
- Measurements: Angle PMS is not directly given as 50°, but the bearing angle at M from the north direction is given as 50°. The direction MS represents South.
- Implied Constructions: The south cardinal point (S) implies a north direction vertically opposite to it. We can infer the north direction from M.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The line MS is along the South direction. Implies North direction is vertically opposite MS.
- We are given an angle of 50 degrees between the line MP and the North direction emanating from point M.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can determine the bearing of P from M by considering the angle between the north direction at M and the line MP.
- Bearing is measured clockwise from North.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure that we have captured the given angle and the direction of South (MS).
