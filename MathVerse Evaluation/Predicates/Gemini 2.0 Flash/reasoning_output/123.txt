PROBLEM 123 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in Rttriangle ABC, angle ACB = 90.0, AC = 4.0, BC = 3.0, rotate triangle ABC around the line where AC is located to obtain a rotating body, then the lateral area of ​​the rotating body is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C. The lengths of sides AC and BC are given as 4 and 3, respectively. The triangle is described as being rotated around the line containing AC.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
When the triangle is rotated around AC, BC will trace a circle with radius BC = 3. This forms a cone, where the slant height is the hypotenuse AB.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle ACB is a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruent figures are directly visible.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
No specific intersection points besides those that define the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Triangle ABC is a right triangle, allowing the Pythagorean theorem to be applied to find the length of AB. The rotation forms a cone.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The given information is sufficient for defining the triangle and establishing the basic properties of the rotating body.
