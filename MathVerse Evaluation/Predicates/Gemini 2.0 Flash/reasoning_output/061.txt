PROBLEM 061 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, point E is on BC, and CD = CE, angle D = 74.0, then the degree of angle B is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows lines, angles, and line segments forming triangles and indicating parallel lines.
- Points: Points are labeled A, B, C, D, and E.
- Lines: Line segments are AB, CD, BC, DE, and CE.
- Angles: Angle D is labeled as 74 degrees.
- Markings: Parallel lines are marked on AB and CD. CD = CE is indicated.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle D is 74 degrees.
- AB || CD, so angle B and angle BCE are same-side interior angles.
- Triangle CDE is isosceles, so angle DEC = angle D = 74 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- CD = CE.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point E lies on BC.
- AB and CD are parallel.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since CD = CE, triangle CDE is isosceles, so angle CED = angle CDE = 74 degrees.
- Then angle DCE = 180 - 74 - 74 = 32 degrees.
- Since AB || CD, angle ABC = angle BCE.
- Angle BCE = angle DCE + angle DCE.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- I have captured all the information from the diagram and expressed all relationships.
