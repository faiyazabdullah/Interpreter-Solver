PROBLEM 680 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A triangular prism has as dimensions those labelled on the diagram. The AB edge has length of 10. The BC edge has length of 3. The CF edge has length of 15. The EX edge and FX edge have the equal length. Find z, the size of \angle BXC, correct to 2 decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes: Rectangle ABCD, triangle prism ABC-EFC
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names: Points A, B, C, D, E, F, X. Lines AB, BC, CF, EF, EX, FX, AD, DE
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values: AB = 10, BC = 3, CF = 15, EX = FX, angle ADC = 90 degrees, angle BCF = 90 degrees.
- Identify ALL special markings: Right angle symbols at ADC and BCF, equal marks on EX and FX.
- Look for implied constructions: A line from B to X forming triangle BXC.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Right angles are ADC and BCF.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- EX = FX

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- X is a point on line EF.
- X is the midpoint of EF.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since EX = FX, X is the midpoint of EF.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates must define the shape, dimensions and relationships in the diagram.
- Length of AB, BC, CF.
- Equality of EX and FX.
- Right angles at ADC and BCF.
- X is a point on EF.
