PROBLEM 626 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The linear function is graphed. The slope is less than 0. It passes through (0,4) and (4,0). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

State the coordinates of the $x$-intercept in the form $(a, b)$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a linear function graphed on a coordinate plane.
- The line passes through the points (0, 4) and (4, 0).
- The equation of the line is given as y = 4 - x.
- The x and y axes are labeled.
- The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis.
- The y-intercept is the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruence or equality markings are present.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the x-axis at the point (4, 0).
- The line intersects the y-axis at the point (0, 4).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The given equation represents a linear relationship between x and y.
- The x-intercept can be found by setting y = 0 in the equation.
- The y-intercept can be found by setting x = 0 in the equation.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is present to determine the x-intercept.
- The x-intercept is the point where the line crosses the x-axis, which occurs when y = 0.
- Substituting y = 0 into the equation y = 4 - x gives 0 = 4 - x, so x = 4.
- Therefore, the x-intercept is (4, 0).
