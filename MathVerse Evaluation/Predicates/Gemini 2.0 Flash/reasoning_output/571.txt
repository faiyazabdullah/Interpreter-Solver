PROBLEM 571 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There are two quadratic functions. The red one is g(x) that goes through the origin and point (2, -4). Find the equation of the dashed line in red. Use exact numbers.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: Graph of two quadratic functions, f and g.
- List points: Origin (0,0), point (2,-4) on g(x).
- Note measurements: The point (2, -4) is given on the graph of g(x).
- No special markings are present.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
No explicit angles or perpendicularity are marked in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No explicit congruence or equality markings are present.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The graph of g(x) passes through the origin (0,0) and the point (2,-4).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The function g(x) is a quadratic function. The vertex of g(x) seems to be at the origin. The equation of g(x) can be written as g(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Since it passes through the origin, c = 0. So, g(x) = ax^2 + bx. Since it passes through (2,-4), -4 = a(2)^2 + b(2) = 4a + 2b. Thus, 2a + b = -2.
The parabola g(x) opens downwards and appears symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Thus g(x) must be of the form g(x) = ax^2. Then since (2,-4) lies on g(x), we have -4 = a(2^2) = 4a, so a = -1.
Therefore, g(x) = -x^2.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The description of the parabola g(x) is complete.
