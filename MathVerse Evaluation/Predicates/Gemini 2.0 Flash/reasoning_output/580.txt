PROBLEM 580 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two curves decreasing from 100 on the y-axis, labeled "recall percentage", as "days" on the x-axis increases. One curve represents Maximilian's recall (gray), and the other curve represents Lucy's recall (black). There are grid lines. We are asked to determine the percentage of content Lucy forgot each day. Maximilian forgets 15% each day. This is shown by his curve in gray. We should notice the shape of the curves as exponential decay curves.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular. There are no explicitly marked angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The graph starts at recall percentage 100 for both. No other equalities are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The gray and black curve start from the same point on the y axis.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The curves are exponential decay curves. Let $M(t)$ be Maximilian's recall percentage after $t$ days, and $L(t)$ be Lucy's recall percentage after $t$ days. We are given that Maximilian forgets 15% of what he knew the previous day. This means $M(t+1) = M(t) * (1-0.15) = M(t) * 0.85$. Since both curves start at 100, $M(0) = 100$ and $L(0) = 100$. The information we extract from the graph is that Maximilian’s curve is represented in gray while Lucy’s is represented in black.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The question asks, "On each day, what percentage of the previous day's content did Lucy forget?". Since we are not solving the problem only representing the scene, we don't need to compute it. We need to specify that the gray graph is for Maximilian's data and that each day Maximilian forgets 15%.
