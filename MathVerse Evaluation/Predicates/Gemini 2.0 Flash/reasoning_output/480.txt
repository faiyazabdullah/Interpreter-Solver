PROBLEM 480 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There are 4 labels on the x-axis $-\pi$, $-\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\pi$ and a curve that goes through ($\frac{2}{\pi}$,0). Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a 2D coordinate system with the x-axis and y-axis. There is a curve drawn on the coordinate system. The x-axis is labeled with $-\pi$, $-\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\frac{2}{\pi}$, and $\pi$. The y-axis ranges from -5 to 5. The curve passes through the point $(\frac{2}{\pi}, 0)$. The curve also passes through the points $(-\pi, 0)$ and $(0,1/2)$

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Not applicable.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The curve intersects the x-axis at $-\pi$ and $\frac{2}{\pi}$.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The x-axis has the following labels: $-\pi$, $-\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\frac{2}{\pi}$, $\pi$.
The curve passes through the following points: $(-\pi, 0)$, $(\frac{2}{\pi}, 0)$, and approximately $(0, 0.5)$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The key information here is that the curve intersects the x-axis at more than one point, meaning that the function could potentially not be one-to-one.
