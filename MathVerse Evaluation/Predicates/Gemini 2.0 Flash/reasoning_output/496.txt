PROBLEM 496 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a quadratic function, which goes through (0,0), (20,0) and opens upward. Determine whether the graph represents a one-to-one function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a curve (a parabola) in the Cartesian coordinate system.
- The curve passes through the origin (0, 0) and the point (20, 0).
- The curve opens upwards.
- The curve is labeled 'f'.
- We can see x and y axes.
- The graph represents a quadratic function because of the parabolic shape.
- The question asks if the graph represents a one-to-one function.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The curve intersects the x-axis at (0, 0) and (20, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The curve is a quadratic function and can be represented as f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Since it passes through (0, 0), c = 0.  Since it also passes through (20, 0), then 400a + 20b = 0 or 20a + b = 0.  Thus, b = -20a.  The function becomes f(x) = ax^2 - 20ax = a(x^2 - 20x).
- Since the parabola opens upwards, 'a' must be positive.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The necessary geometric relationships are identified.
