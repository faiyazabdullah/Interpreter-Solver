PROBLEM 406 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of the figure is $ 56.5 \mathrm{~m}$. Consider the sector below.

Calculate the area. Give your answer correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shape: The image shows a sector of a circle.
- Points: No specific points are labeled.
- Lines: Two line segments form the radii of the sector, and a curved arc connects their endpoints.
- Angles: One angle is given as 123 degrees.
- Measurements: The radius of the sector is given as 56.5m.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The shape is a sector of a circle.
- Radius = 56.5m
- Central Angle = 123 degrees

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle is 123 degrees. We need to convert this to radians for calculating area.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two radii are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the sector can be calculated using the formula: Area = (angle/360) * pi * r^2, where angle is in degrees.
- We need to convert the given angle in degrees to radians.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the radius and the central angle. We can use the formula for the area of a sector.
