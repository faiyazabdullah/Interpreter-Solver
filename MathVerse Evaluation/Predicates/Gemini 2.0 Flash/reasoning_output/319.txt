PROBLEM 319 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diagonal length of the blue quadrilateral is 8yd, the diagonal length of the green quadrilateral is 4yd, and the area of the blue quadrilateral is 36yd ^ 2. For the pair of similar figures, find the area of the green figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two quadrilaterals are shown, one blue and one green.
- The diagonal length of the blue quadrilateral is given as 8 yd.
- The area of the blue quadrilateral is given as 36 yd^2.
- The diagonal length of the green quadrilateral is given as 4 yd.
- The two quadrilaterals appear to be similar.

STEP 2: QUADRILATERAL ANALYSIS
- The quadrilaterals are similar.
- We are given the length of a diagonal of each quadrilateral.
- We are given the area of the larger quadrilateral.

STEP 3: SIMILARITY AND AREA RATIO
- If two figures are similar with a scale factor of k, then the ratio of their areas is k^2.

STEP 4: PREDICATE GENERATION PREPARATION
- We need to represent the quadrilaterals, their diagonal lengths, the area of the blue quadrilateral, and their similarity.
