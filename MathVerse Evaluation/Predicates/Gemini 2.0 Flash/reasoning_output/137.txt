PROBLEM 137 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the picture, it is an ancient masher in the countryside. It is known that the height of the support column AB is 0.3, the length of the pedal DE is 1.0, and the distance from the support point A to the foot D is 0.6. When foot D touches the ground, the head point E rises ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a lever system with points A, B, D, E.
- Line segments AB, DE are present.
- The height of AB is 0.3.
- The length of DE is 1.0.
- The distance from A to D is 0.6.
- The ground is represented as a horizontal line.
- AB is perpendicular to the ground.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle between AB and the ground is 90 degrees.
- There are two triangle-like shapes formed by the lever and the ground and support.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use similar triangles to solve the problem.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the height that point E rises.
