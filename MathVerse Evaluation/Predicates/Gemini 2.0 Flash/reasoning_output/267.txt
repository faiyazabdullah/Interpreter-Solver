PROBLEM 267 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Point A, B, and C are on the circle. The radius angle of A C is 122 degrees. Find m \angle B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center (implied) with points A, B, and C on the circle.
- Line segments AB and BC are chords of the circle.
- Arc AC has a measure of 122 degrees.
- Angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.
- AB and BC are chords of the circle.
- Arc AC has a measure of 122 degrees.
- The central angle subtending arc AC would have a measure of 122 degrees.
- Angle ABC is an inscribed angle subtending arc AC.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We need to determine angle ABC.
- Angle ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC.
- The measure of inscribed angle ABC is half the measure of the intercepted arc AC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruences are marked in the diagram.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The measure of inscribed angle ABC is half the measure of arc AC.
- Measure of arc AC is 122 degrees.
- Therefore, angle ABC = 122 / 2 = 61 degrees.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all necessary elements to solve for the measure of angle B.
