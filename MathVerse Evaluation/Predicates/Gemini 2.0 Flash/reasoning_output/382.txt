PROBLEM 382 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this right-angled triangle, one leg measuring 12, the hypotenuse measures 8\sqrt{3}. Solve for the unknown \theta . Leave your answer in degrees.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle.
- The triangle has one right angle.
- The triangle has one angle labelled theta.
- One side has a length of 12.
- The hypotenuse has a length of 8\sqrt{3}.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle.
- There is an angle labeled theta.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent shapes.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at the vertices of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Pythagorean theorem applies.
- Trigonometric functions can be used.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The length of the hypotenuse and one leg are given.
- One angle is labeled theta.
- The triangle is a right triangle.
