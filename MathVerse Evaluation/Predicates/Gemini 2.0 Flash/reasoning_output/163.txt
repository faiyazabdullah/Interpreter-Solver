PROBLEM 163 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in Rttriangle ABC, angle C = 90.0, AC = 4.0, AB = 5.0, then the value of cosA is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC with a right angle at C.
- The length of side AC is 4.
- The length of side AB is 5.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle C is a right angle.
- Sides AC and BC are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent shapes are apparent.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and AC intersect at point A.
- Lines AC and BC intersect at point C.
- Lines AB and BC intersect at point B.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- The Pythagorean theorem applies: AC^2 + BC^2 = AB^2.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information provided is enough to express all properties of the triangle.
