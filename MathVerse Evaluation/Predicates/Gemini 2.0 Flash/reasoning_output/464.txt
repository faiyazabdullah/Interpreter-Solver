PROBLEM 464 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, on the graph.
Find the radius of the circle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle on a coordinate plane. The circle intersects the x and y axes at four points. The center of the circle is at approximately (-3,-3). The circle appears to intersect the y-axis at approximately y = 0 and y= -6. It appears to intersect the x axis at approximately x=-6 and x=0.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The center of the circle is approximately at (-3, -3).
The circle passes through points approximately at (0, -3), (-6, -3), (-3, 0), and (-3, -6).
The radius of the circle appears to be 3 units.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The radii of the circle are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The circle intersects the x-axis at two points.
The circle intersects the y-axis at two points.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The radius of the circle is the distance from the center to any point on the circle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates below describe the circle, its center, and the axes. This information will be sufficient to determine the radius of the circle.
