PROBLEM 335 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the south direction is 32°.

What is the true bearing of A from O?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a coordinate system with a point A and the origin O.
The north direction is labeled N.
The angle between the line OA and the south direction is 32°.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The angle between the south direction and OA is 32°.
The north and south directions form a straight line.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruence or equality is indicated in the diagram.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Point A lies in the southwest quadrant.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The angle between OA and the south direction is given. The bearing of A from O can be calculated from this.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The image shows the angle between OA and the south direction.
