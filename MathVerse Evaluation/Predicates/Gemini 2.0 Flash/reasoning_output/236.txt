PROBLEM 236 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two rays intersect and form four angles all as x degrees. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There are two lines intersecting at a point.
- The angles formed by the intersection are labeled as x degrees.
- The four angles formed at the intersection are equal, each labeled as x degrees.
- The lines are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angles between the lines are equal and denoted as x degrees.
- The four angles form a full circle, which is 360 degrees.
- Since there are four angles labeled as x, the sum of the angles is 4x degrees.
- Each angle is a right angle which implies Perpendicular relationship between the lines.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of the four angles is equal to 360 degrees.
- Since all four angles are x, we have 4x = 360.
- Thus x = 90.
-The intersecting lines are perpendicular to each other.
