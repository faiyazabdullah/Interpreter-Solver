PROBLEM 157 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in triangle ABC, angle C = 90.0, if AC = 4.0, BC = 3.0, then cosB is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ABC.
- Point A, B, and C are vertices of the triangle.
- Angle C is a right angle.
- AC = 4.0 and BC = 3.0 are given side lengths.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle C is a right angle (90 degrees).
- Line AC is perpendicular to Line BC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal elements are marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB, BC, and AC intersect at points A, B, and C respectively.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle.
- The lengths of sides AC and BC are known.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is available to determine the cosine of angle B.
