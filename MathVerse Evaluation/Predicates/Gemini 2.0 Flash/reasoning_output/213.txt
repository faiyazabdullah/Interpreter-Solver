PROBLEM 213 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot P, the radius is 2 inches. \angle Q P T is 112 degrees, and \angle RPS is 130 degrees. Find the length of \widehat R S. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes: Circle, lines, angles.
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names: Points P, Q, R, S, T. Lines PQ, PR, PS, PT.
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values: Angle QPT = 112 degrees, Angle RPS = 130 degrees, radius = 2.
- Identify ALL special markings: None.
- Look for implied constructions: Radii of the circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Identify the center and all points on the circle: Center P. Points Q, R, S, T on the circle.
- Determine which lines are radii, chords, diameters, or tangents: PQ, PR, PS, PT are radii.
- Look for inscribed angles, central angles, and arc relationships: Angles QPT and RPS are central angles.
- Check for perpendicular relationships involving radii and chords: None visible.
- Identify any equal radius relationships: PQ = PR = PS = PT = 2.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Examine ALL angles shown in the diagram, both marked and unmarked: Angle QPT = 112 degrees, Angle RPS = 130 degrees.
- Look for right angle indicators or perpendicular relationships: None visible.
- Check for angle bisectors or special angle relationships: None visible.
- Identify complementary, supplementary, or vertical angles: None visible.
- Look for inscribed angles and their corresponding arcs: None visible.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL equal lengths, angles, or shapes (look for tick marks, identical measurements): PQ = PR = PS = PT = 2.
- Check for congruent triangles or similar figures: None visible.
- Look for equal radii in circles: PQ = PR = PS = PT = 2.
- Identify parallel lines or equal distances: None visible.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Determine where lines intersect and at what points: PQ, PR, PS, PT intersect at P.
- Check if points lie on specific lines or circles: Q, R, S, T lie on Circle(P).
- Identify midpoints, centroids, or other special points: None visible.
- Look for points that divide segments in specific ratios: None visible.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Combine observations to identify implicit relationships: Radii are equal in length. Central angles correspond to arcs.
- Look for theorem applications (Pythagorean, inscribed angle, etc.): None directly visible at this stage.
- Identify geometric constructions that create specific relationships: Circle with radii.
- Check for properties that follow from the given constraints: PQ = PR = PS = PT.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured: Radius, central angle RPS.
- Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented: Relationship between central angle and arc length.
- Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed: Radii are equal.
- Confirm that the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving: The predicates will give the radius and the measure of the central angle.
