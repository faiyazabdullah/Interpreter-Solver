PROBLEM 015 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the straight line a and the straight line b are intercepted by the straight line c, b perpendicular  c, the foot of perpendicular is the point A, angle 1 = 70.0. If the line b is parallel to the line a, the line b can be rotated () clockwise around the point A
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: lines, angles.
- List points: A.
- List lines: a, b, c.
- List angles: Angle 1, right angle at A.
- Measurements: Angle 1 = 70 degrees, right angle at A.
- Special markings: Right angle symbol at A.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 is labeled as 70 degrees.
- Line b is perpendicular to line c at point A, forming a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality markings are present.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line c intersects line b at point A.
- Line a and line c intersect.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- b perpendicular to c is a key relationship.
- Need to determine the angle of rotation for b to be parallel to a.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information and relationships have been captured.
