PROBLEM 649 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the sphere shown. The diameter is 4 centimeters.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sphere.
- The diameter of the sphere is given as 4 cm.
- There is a dotted circle inside the sphere representing the cross-section.
- There is a line segment passing through the center of the sphere, indicating the diameter.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The diameter is 4 cm.
- The radius is half the diameter, so the radius is 2 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are explicitly shown or marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the sphere is consistent throughout.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The diameter passes through the center of the sphere.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of a sphere is (4/3) * pi * r^3, where r is the radius.
- Since the diameter is 4 cm, the radius is 2 cm.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the shape (sphere) and the diameter.
- We have inferred the radius.
- We need to calculate the volume.
- The predicates need to reflect the given information.

PREDICATES:
Shape(Sphere)
DiameterOf(Sphere)
LengthOf(DiameterOf(Sphere),4)
RadiusOf(Sphere)
Equals(RadiusOf(Sphere),HalfOf(LengthOf(DiameterOf(Sphere),4)))
