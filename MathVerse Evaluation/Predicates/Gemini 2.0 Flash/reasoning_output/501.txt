PROBLEM 501 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a piecewise function going through (-3, -4), (-1, 0), (0, 2), and (1, 4). Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows a piecewise function graphed on a coordinate plane. It consists of horizontal and linear segments.
- Points: Key points are approximately (-3, -4), (-1, 0), (0, 2), and (1, 4).
- Lines: We have line segments that are horizontal and diagonal.
- Measurements: Numerical values are along the axes.
- Markings: Arrows on the ends of the segments indicate that they extend indefinitely in that direction.
- Implicit: Implied coordinate grid, and the nature of piecewise function
The function is constant on the interval (-inf, -3], increasing on [-1, 1], and constant on [1, inf).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
No explicit angle or perpendicularity information given. However, the coordinate grid implies perpendicular axes.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No explicit congruency or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Points lie on the piecewise function as indicated in step 1.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The segments change slope at (-3, -4), (-1, 0), and (1, 4). Function values are fixed at these points. The segments are connected implying a continuous piecewise function.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All information is captured, which is relevant to determine where the piecewise function is increasing, decreasing, or constant.
