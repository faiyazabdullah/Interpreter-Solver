PROBLEM 064 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: After filling some oil in a cylindrical oil tank with a diameter of 200.0, the cross section is shown in the figure. If the width of the oil surface AB = 160.0, the maximum depth of oil is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Circle: There is one circle with center O.
- Points: Points A and B lie on the circle.
- Line: AB is a line segment.
- Measurements: Diameter = 200, AB = 160.
- Implicit Construction: A perpendicular line from O to AB can be constructed to find the depth of the oil. The oil depth is the perpendicular distance from the midpoint of AB to the arc AB.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: O is the center of the circle.
- Points on circle: A and B are on the circle.
- Diameter: The diameter of the circle is 200.
- Radius: Radius of the circle is 100.
- Chord: AB is a chord of the circle.
- Implied perpendicular bisector: The line from O to the midpoint of AB is perpendicular to AB.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are marked.
- Implied perpendicular: A line from O to the midpoint of AB is perpendicular to AB.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Radius: OA = OB = 100.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line from O intersects AB. Let's call this intersection point M.
- M is the midpoint of AB.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- OA = OB (radii)
- AB = 160
- Diameter = 200
- Radius = 100
- OM is perpendicular to AB
- AM = MB = 80

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
