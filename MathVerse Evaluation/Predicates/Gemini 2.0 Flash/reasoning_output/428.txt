PROBLEM 428 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The logo of a shop consists of five semicircles; four small semicircles each with the same radius, and one large semicircle. The perimeter of the whole shape is 14\pi  units.
The entire shape is to be enlarged by a factor of 5 to form a logo sticker on the window of a shop front. What area of the shop front window will the sticker take up?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a shape composed of semicircles. There is one large semicircle and four smaller semicircles of equal size.
- The perimeter of the entire shape is given as 14π.
- The whole shape is to be enlarged by a factor of 5.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The shape consists of semicircles. Four of them are small and equal in radius, and one is a larger semicircle.
- Let 'r' be the radius of each of the four smaller semicircles, and let 'R' be the radius of the larger semicircle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit angles marked in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Four smaller semicircles are of equal radius, r.
- The perimeter of the overall shape is given as 14π.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The semicircles are arranged such that their diameters lie on a horizontal line (implied).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The perimeter is the sum of the arcs of all semicircles: 4(πr) + πR = 14π, therefore, 4r + R = 14.
- Area of original shape is the area of the large semi-circle minus the area of the four smaller semicircles which is $1/2 \pi R^2 - 2 \pi r^2$.
- The shape is enlarged by a factor of 5. When a shape is enlarged by a factor of k, its area becomes k^2 times the original area. Therefore area of the enlarged shape is $25(1/2 \pi R^2 - 2 \pi r^2)$.
- Area of each small semi-circle is $1/2 \pi r^2$ and since there are 4 small semi-circles, total area of small semi-circles = $4 \times 1/2 \pi r^2 = 2\pi r^2$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to determine R and r to calculate the area of shop window that sticker takes up.
- Given perimeter 14π, and scale factor 5.
- We can express the area of the enlarged shape in terms of R and r by using scale factor and then determine total area using these values.
