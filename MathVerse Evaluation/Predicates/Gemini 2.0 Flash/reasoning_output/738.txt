PROBLEM 738 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the solid is constructed by a cone and semi-sphere. The radius of the cone is 3cm and its height is 12cm. Find the volume of the composite figure shown, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: Cone, Hemisphere (half-sphere)
- Measurements: Cone height = 12 cm, Radius = 3 cm
- Implied: The cone and hemisphere share the same radius. The height of the cone is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone is a circle, and the hemisphere has a circular base. The radii of both are equal.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cone is perpendicular to its base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radii of the cone's base and the hemisphere's base are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The circular base of the cone and the base of the hemisphere coincide, forming a composite solid.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the composite solid is the sum of the volume of the cone and the volume of the hemisphere.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary geometric information is available in the image.
