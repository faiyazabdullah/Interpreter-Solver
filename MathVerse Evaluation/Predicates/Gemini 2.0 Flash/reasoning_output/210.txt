PROBLEM 210 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two triangles A B E and A C D are similar with a shared vertex A. B E and C D are parallel. Find A E if A B = 12, A C = 16, and E D = 5.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a triangle ACD with point B on AC and point E on AD.
- AB = 12, AC = 16, ED = 5
- BE and CD are parallel.
- Triangles ABE and ACD are similar.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no right angles or perpendicular relationships indicated.
- Since BE and CD are parallel, angle ABE is congruent to angle ACD, and angle AEB is congruent to angle ADC. Also, angle BAC is congruent to angle CAD.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Since triangles ABE and ACD are similar, their corresponding angles are congruent, and their sides are proportional.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AC and AD intersect at point A.
- Point B lies on line AC.
- Point E lies on line AD.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Because BE is parallel to CD, we know triangles ABE and ACD are similar.
- AE/AD = AB/AC

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information needed to solve for AE. We know AB, AC, and ED. We need to find AE. We have the similarity relationship that AE/AD = AB/AC. We also know that AD = AE + ED, where ED = 5. So, AE/(AE+5) = 12/16.
