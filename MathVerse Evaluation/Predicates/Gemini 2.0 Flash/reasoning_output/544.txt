PROBLEM 544 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Kai is swinging on a trapeze in a circus show. The horizontal distance between Kai and the edge of the stage, in meters, is modeled by $D(t)$ where $t$ is the time in seconds. The function is graphed below, along with one segment highlighted, a red double arrow from (5,21) to (15,21). What is the meaning of the highlighted segment?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a periodic function, D(t), representing the horizontal distance between Kai and the edge of the stage. The x-axis represents time (t) in seconds, and the y-axis represents distance in meters.
- The graph is a sinusoidal curve, oscillating between a minimum of 9 and a maximum of 21.
- The graph starts at approximately (0, 9).
- A red double arrow highlights a segment from (5, 21) to (15, 21).

STEP 2: PERIOD ANALYSIS
- The highlighted segment represents one period of the function, i.e. the time it takes for the function to complete one full cycle.
- The length of the segment on the x-axis represents the period, which is 15 - 5 = 10 seconds.
