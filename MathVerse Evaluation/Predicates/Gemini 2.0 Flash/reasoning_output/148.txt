PROBLEM 148 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, Xiaodong uses a bamboo pole with a length of 3.2 as a measuring tool to measure the height of the school flagpole, and moves the bamboo pole so that the shadow on the top of the pole and the flag pole falls on the same point on the ground. At this time, the distance between the bamboo pole and this point is 8.0, and the distance from the flag pole is 22.0, then the height of the flag pole is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two right triangles are formed.
- Let the height of the bamboo pole be h1 = 3.2m.
- Let the distance from the point to the bamboo pole be d1 = 8m.
- Let the distance from the point to the flagpole be d2 = 22m.
- Let the height of the flagpole be h2.
- The two triangles are similar since they share the angle at the point on the ground and both are right triangles.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Two right angles are formed, one at the base of the bamboo pole and the other at the base of the flagpole.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two triangles are similar.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line from the top of the bamboo pole to the point on the ground intersects the bamboo pole and the ground.
- The line from the top of the flagpole to the point on the ground intersects the flagpole and the ground.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The two triangles are similar, so the ratio of corresponding sides are equal.
- h1 / d1 = h2 / d2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information provided is sufficient to solve for the height of the flagpole.
- The key relationship is the similarity of the two triangles.
