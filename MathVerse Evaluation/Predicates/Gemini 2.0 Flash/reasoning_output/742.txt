PROBLEM 742 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A wedding cake consists of three cylinders stacked on top of each other. The top layer has a radius and height of 20 cm, the middle layer has a radius double this, and the same height and the bottom layer has a radius three times as big, and is twice as high.

All the sides and top surfaces are to be covered in icing, but not the bottom.

What is the surface area of the cake that needs to be iced?

Give your answer to the nearest cm2.

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows three cylinders stacked on top of each other.
- The top cylinder has a radius of 20 cm and a height of 20 cm.
- The middle cylinder has a height of 20 cm and a radius double the top cylinder's radius.
- The bottom cylinder has a height of 40 cm and a radius three times the top cylinder's radius.

STEP 2: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need the radius and height of each cylinder to calculate the surface area.
- The image provides the radius and height of the top cylinder, and the relationships between the radii and height of the other cylinders.

PREDICATES:
LengthOf: LengthOf(radiusTopCylinder)
LengthOf: LengthOf(heightTopCylinder)
LengthOf: LengthOf(radiusMiddleCylinder)
LengthOf: LengthOf(heightMiddleCylinder)
LengthOf: LengthOf(radiusBottomCylinder)
LengthOf: LengthOf(heightBottomCylinder)
Equals(LengthOf(radiusTopCylinder), 20)
Equals(LengthOf(heightTopCylinder), 20)
Equals(LengthOf(heightMiddleCylinder), 20)
Equals(LengthOf(heightBottomCylinder), 40)
Equals(LengthOf(radiusMiddleCylinder), Mul(2,LengthOf(radiusTopCylinder)))
Equals(LengthOf(radiusBottomCylinder), Mul(3,LengthOf(radiusTopCylinder)))
