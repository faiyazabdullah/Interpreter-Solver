PROBLEM 005 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, straight lines a and b intersect at point O. If angle 1 is equal to 50.0, then angle 2 is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two straight lines a and b intersect at point O.
- Angle 1 is labeled with a measure of 50 degrees.
- Angle 2 is also present in the diagram.
- Angle 1 and the angle adjacent to angle 2 (vertically opposite angle of angle 2) are supplementary angles.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 and its adjacent angle on line a are supplementary.
- Angle 2 and its adjacent angle on line a (which is angle 1) are supplementary.
- Angle 1 and the angle vertically opposite to it are equal.
- Angle 2 and the angle vertically opposite to it are equal.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The vertically opposite angles are congruent.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line a and line b intersect at point O.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Angle 1 + Angle adjacent to angle 1 on line a = 180 degrees.
- Angle 2 + Angle 1 = 180 degrees.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The relationships between angle 1 and angle 2 are key to solving this problem. All necessary information is captured to define these relationships.
