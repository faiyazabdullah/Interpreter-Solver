PROBLEM 532 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the midline equation of the function? Give an exact expression.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a trigonometric function.
- We see a minimum point at $(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 2.4)$ and a maximum point at $(\frac{3}{2}\pi, 13)$.
- The gridlines can be used to determine the period of the function.
- The problem asks for the midline of the function. The midline is the horizontal line that runs midway between the maximum and minimum values of the function.

STEP 2: IDENTIFY MAX AND MIN VALUES
- The maximum value of the function is 13.
- The minimum value of the function is 2.4.

STEP 3: CALCULATE MIDLINE
- The midline is given by the average of the maximum and minimum values.
- Midline = $\frac{13 + 2.4}{2} = \frac{15.4}{2} = 7.7$.
- Therefore, the equation of the midline is $y = 7.7$.
