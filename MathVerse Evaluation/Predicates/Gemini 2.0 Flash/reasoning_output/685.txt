PROBLEM 685 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a cylinder with a diagonal line labeled L. The height of the cylinder is given as 13, and the diameter of the circular base is given as 3. We want to find the length of the longest straw (L) that can fit into the can. This can be visualized as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the height of the can is one leg, and the diameter of the circular base is the other leg.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The cylinder has a circular base. The diameter of the circle is 3. The height of the cylinder is 13.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the base. The diagonal forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The height is given as 13. The diameter is given as 3.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The bottom vertex of L intersects the circumference of the base, while the top vertex intersects the circumference of the top face.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
By the Pythagorean theorem, L^2 = height^2 + diameter^2. Therefore, L = sqrt(height^2 + diameter^2) = sqrt(13^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(169+9) = sqrt(178) â‰ˆ 13.34. We want to find the length of the longest straw that can fit in the can rounded down. The question gives the values for the height (13) and the diameter (3). The diagonal L is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the height and the diameter.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified all the geometric shapes, measurements, and relationships. We have recognized that the longest length can be obtained by forming a right triangle using the height and diameter as the legs and the longest length as the hypotenuse.
