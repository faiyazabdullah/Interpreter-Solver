PROBLEM 746 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the triangular prism below. Lengths of AB, CF are 10, 4, 15. EX and XF have same length.
Find the length of CX correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a triangular prism. The base is a rectangle ABCD. The front face is a rectangle BCFE. There are right angle markings at angles ADC and BCF. The length of AB is 10, the length of BC is 4, and the length of CF is 15. EX and XF have equal length.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angles ADC and BCF are right angles. Therefore, lines AD and DC are perpendicular, and lines BC and CF are perpendicular. AB is parallel to DC. BC is parallel to AD. BE is parallel to CF.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The length of EX equals the length of XF, so X is the midpoint of EF. AB = CD = 10, BC = AD = 4, CF = BE = 15.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines EF and BC are not explicitly shown to intersect, but they are part of the prism.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
ABCD is a rectangle. BCFE is a rectangle. Since EX = XF, X is the midpoint of EF.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified all the geometric shapes, measurements, and relationships.
