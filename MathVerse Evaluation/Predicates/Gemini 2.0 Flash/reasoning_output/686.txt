PROBLEM 686 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the cylinder shown. The height is 13 cm and radius is 3 cm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure is a cylinder-like shape composed of a rectangle and two half-circles (which form a full circle).
- There is a height measurement of 13 cm.
- There is a radius measurement of 3 cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is 3 cm.
- The top and bottom are circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangle forms right angles with the top circle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two half-circles forming the top and bottom of the object are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides of the rectangle are tangent to the circles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height of the rectangle is 13 cm.
- The radius of the circle is 3 cm, so the diameter is 6 cm.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates cover the essential measurements and geometric relationships needed to define the shape.
