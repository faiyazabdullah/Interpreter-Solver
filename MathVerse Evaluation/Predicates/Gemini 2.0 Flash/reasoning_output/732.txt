PROBLEM 732 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the base of the prism is $30cm^2$ and the height of the prism is 9cm. Find the volume of the prism shown.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a prism.
- The base is a pentagon.
- The height of the prism is 9cm.
- The area of the base is 30 cm^2.

STEP 2: NO CIRCLES

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the prism is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two bases of the prism are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of a prism is the area of the base times the height.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information needed to calculate the volume of the prism is present.
