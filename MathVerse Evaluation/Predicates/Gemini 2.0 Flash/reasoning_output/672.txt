PROBLEM 672 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the composite figure shown, which consists of a cone and a hemisphere joined at their bases. The radius is 4 cm. The perpendicular height of cone is 10cm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows a composite figure consisting of a cone and a hemisphere joined at their bases.
- Measurements: Radius = 4 cm, Height of cone = 10 cm
- Special markings: Right angle symbol between the height and radius of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone and the base of the hemisphere form a circle.
- The radius of the circle is 4 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cone is perpendicular to the radius of the circular base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the cone's base and the hemisphere's base are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The cone and the hemisphere intersect at their bases, forming a circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The composite figure's surface area is the sum of the cone's lateral surface area and the hemisphere's surface area.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information needed to solve for the surface area of the composite figure has been identified.
