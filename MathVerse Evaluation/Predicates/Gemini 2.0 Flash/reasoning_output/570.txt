PROBLEM 570 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a scaled version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two parabolas, labeled f and g, plotted on a coordinate plane. The parabola f has the equation y = x^2. The parabola g appears to be a vertically scaled version of f. A point (2,3) is shown on the curve g. The vertex of both parabolas is at the origin (0,0).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The axes appear to be perpendicular, forming a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two parabolas are not congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The vertex of both parabolas is at the intersection of the x and y axes, which is the origin (0,0). The point (2,3) lies on parabola g.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The parabola f is given by the equation y = x^2. Parabola g is a vertically scaled version of f. Since the point (2,3) lies on g, we can express g as y = a*x^2, and then substitute the point (2,3) into the equation to solve for 'a'. 3 = a * (2^2) = 4a. Thus, a = 3/4. Therefore, the equation of g is y = (3/4)x^2. The question asks only for the geometric predicates representing the given diagram.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates must capture all relevant geometric relationships, shapes, points and location, functions, axes, and the information needed to formulate the equation for g(x).
