PROBLEM 351 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A man stands at point A looking at the top of two poles. Pole 1 has height 8 m and angle of elevation 34^\circ  and Pole 2 has height 25 m and angle of elevation 57^\circ . The man wishes to find the distance between the two poles.
Hence find BC, the distance between the two poles in metres.

Round your answer to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see two poles (Pole 1 and Pole 2), represented as line segments.
- There's a point A representing the man's position.
- There are two right triangles formed by the poles and the lines of sight.
- Angle of elevation to the top of Pole 1 is 34 degrees.
- Angle of elevation to the top of Pole 2 is 57 degrees.
- Height of Pole 1 is 8 m.
- Height of Pole 2 is 25 m.
- We need to find the distance between the two poles, BC.
- Let AB = x and AC = y.
- The poles are perpendicular to the ground.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle at B and C are right angles.
- Angle of elevation to Pole 1 is 34 degrees.
- Angle of elevation to Pole 2 is 57 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent triangles or equal lengths directly indicated.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point A is the intersection of the lines of sight to the top of the poles and the ground.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometric ratios (tan) to relate the angles of elevation to the heights of the poles and the distances x and y.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the necessary relationships to solve for BC.
- tan(34) = 8/x, so x = 8/tan(34)
- tan(57) = 25/y, so y = 25/tan(57)
- BC = y - x
