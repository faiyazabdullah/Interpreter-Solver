PROBLEM 149 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, CD is a plane mirror, the light is emitted from point A, reflected by point E on CD, and irradiated to point B. If the incident angle is Î±, AC perpendicular  CD, BD perpendicular  CD, the feet of perpendicular are C, D, and AC = 3.0, BD = 6.0, CD = 10.0, then the length of the line segment ED is ()

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Points A, B, C, D, E; Lines AC, AE, CD, BE, BD; Angles ACE, BDE, AEC, BED, alpha; Right triangles ACE and BDE.
- Measurements: AC = 3, BD = 6, CD = 10.
- Special markings: Right angle markers at C and D. Angle alpha is marked. The light reflects at E, so the incident angle AEC equals the reflected angle BED.
- Implied constructions: AC perpendicular to CD and BD perpendicular to CD.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angles ACE and BDE are right angles.
- Angle AEC equals angle BED (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection).
- AC is perpendicular to CD, BD is perpendicular to CD.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or similar triangles are directly marked. However, triangles ACE and BDE share an angle relationship due to reflection.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point E lies on line CD. Lines AE and BE intersect at point E on line CD.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AC and BD are perpendicular to CD, AC is parallel to BD.
- Triangles ACE and BDE are right triangles. The equality of the reflection angle allows us to find similar triangles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is captured: the right angles, the given lengths, and the equal angles due to reflection.
