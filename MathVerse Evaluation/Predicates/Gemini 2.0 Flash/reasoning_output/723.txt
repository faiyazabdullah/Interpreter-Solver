PROBLEM 723 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the height of the cylindrical water tank is 3x and the radius of its base is 5x+3. The cylindrical water tank is leaking at a constant rate of 3\pi x litres per second (where x is a fixed unknown). If the water tank was initially full, calculate the amount of water remaining after \left(2x+2\right)^2 seconds. Give your simplified answer in expanded form.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cylinder with a height of 3x and a radius of 5x+3.
- The cylinder is partially filled with water.
- We are given that the water tank leaks at a constant rate of 3πx liters per second.
- We need to calculate the amount of water remaining after (2x+2)^2 seconds.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The top and bottom faces of the cylinder are circles.
- The radius of the circles is 5x+3.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The top and bottom circles are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The height connects the centers of the top and bottom circles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the cylinder is πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height.
- The volume of the water leaked is the rate of leakage multiplied by the time.
- The remaining water is the initial volume minus the leaked volume.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the information needed to calculate the volume of the cylinder and the amount of water leaked.
- The radius and height are given in terms of x.
- The leakage rate and time are given in terms of x.
