PROBLEM 308 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A B \perp D C and G H \perp F E. A C = 4.4, G H = 3.15, and G E = 6.3. If \triangle A C D \sim \triangle G E F, find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two triangles are present: Triangle(A,C,D) and Triangle(G,E,F).
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H
- Lines: AB, DC, AC, AD, GH, FE, GE, GF
- Measurements: AC = 4.4, GH = 3.15, GE = 6.3
- AB is perpendicular to DC and GH is perpendicular to FE.
- Triangle ACD is similar to Triangle GEF.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC and Angle GHE are right angles.
- AB is perpendicular to DC and GH is perpendicular to FE.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Triangle ACD is similar to Triangle GEF.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point B lies on Line DC
- Point H lies on Line FE

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since Triangle ACD is similar to Triangle GEF, the ratios of corresponding sides and altitudes are equal.
- AB is the altitude of Triangle ACD from vertex A to base DC.
- GH is the altitude of Triangle GEF from vertex G to base FE.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All given information has been captured.
- The perpendicularity and similarity relationships are represented.
