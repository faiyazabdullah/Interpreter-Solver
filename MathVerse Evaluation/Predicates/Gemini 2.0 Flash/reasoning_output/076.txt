PROBLEM 076 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, a parallel b, point B is on the straight line b, and AB perpendicular  BC, angle 1 = 36.0, then angle 2 = ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows lines, points, and angles.
- Points: A, B, C are labeled points.
- Lines: Line a, line b, Line BC, Line AB
- Angles: Angle 1, Angle 2, Angle ABC = 90 degrees, an unmarked angle that is supplementary to angle 1
- Measurements: Angle 1 = 36 degrees
- Special markings: a || b, AB ⊥ BC
- Implied constructions: None

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 is given as 36 degrees.
- Angle ABC is a right angle (90 degrees).
- Line AB is perpendicular to Line BC.
- Angle 2 is formed by line a and line AB.
- Since a || b, there is a relationship between Angle 1 and Angle 2

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruence markings.
- Parallel lines imply equal corresponding angles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point B lies on line b.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since a || b, the corresponding angles are equal.
- Because AB ⊥ BC, angle ABC = 90 degrees
- Angle 1 + angle between line b and line AB = 180 degrees. Therefore, the angle between line b and line AB = 180 - 36 = 144.
- The angle between line b and line AB = 90 + angle CBA. Therefore, Angle CBA = 144 - 90 = 54.
- Angle 2 = 180 - 90 - (180 - angle CBA) = 180 - (90+54) = 36

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should include all geometric shapes, measurements, and relationships.
- Parallel lines and perpendicular lines are crucial for the solution.
