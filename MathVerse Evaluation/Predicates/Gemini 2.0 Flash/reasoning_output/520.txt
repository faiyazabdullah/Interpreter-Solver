PROBLEM 520 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Esteban's account balance can be modeled by $f(t)=1000 \cdot e^{(0.08 t)}$ and Anna's account balance can be modeled by $g(t)=750 \cdot e^{(0.12 t)}$, where $t$ is the number of years since they opened their accounts. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,1000), (5,1500), and $g(x)$ in red goes through (6,1500), (8,2000). When do the accounts have the same balance?
Round your answer to the nearest integer.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two exponential curves labeled f and g.
- The x-axis is labeled 't' and represents the number of years.
- The y-axis represents the account balance.
- There are two equations: f(t) = 1000 * e^(0.08t) and g(t) = 750 * e^(0.12t).
- The graph of f(t) passes through (0, 1000) and (5, 1500) approximately.
- The graph of g(t) passes through (6, 1500) and (8, 2000) approximately.
- The scales on both axes are linear.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit congruence markings.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The curves f(t) and g(t) intersect at some point.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The functions f(t) and g(t) represent exponential growth.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information to set up the equation f(t) = g(t) is provided.
