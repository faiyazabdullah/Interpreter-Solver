PROBLEM 688 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Calculate the volume of the half cylinder correct to one decimal place. The height is 9 cm and diameter is 6 cm.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a half-cylinder. The diameter of the half-cylinder's base is labeled as 6 cm, and the height of the half-cylinder is labeled as 9 cm. The figure consists of two semi-circles and a rectangle joining them.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The diameter of the semi-circular base is 6 cm, so the radius is 3 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The height is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two semi-circles are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The semi-circles are positioned at the two ends of the height.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The volume of the half-cylinder can be calculated using the radius of the base (3 cm) and the height (9 cm).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates capture all the given information necessary to calculate the volume of the half-cylinder.

PREDICATES:
Shape(HalfCylinder)
LengthOf(Diameter)=6
LengthOf(Height)=9
DiameterOf(Base)=6
HeightOf(HalfCylinder)=9
RadiusOf(Base)=3
