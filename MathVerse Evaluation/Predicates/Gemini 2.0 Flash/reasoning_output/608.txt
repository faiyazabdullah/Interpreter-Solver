Question: The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What is the average rate of change?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph with a line. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price. The line passes through two points that can be estimated: (6, 17) and (16, 22).
There are two identified points on the line.

STEP 2: Determine the slope of the line.

STEP 3: Use the slope to determine the average rate of change.

PREDICATES:
Point(A)
Point(B)
Line(A,B)
PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(A,B))
PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,B))
Equals(6,6)
Equals(16,16)
Equals(17,17)
Equals(22,22)
