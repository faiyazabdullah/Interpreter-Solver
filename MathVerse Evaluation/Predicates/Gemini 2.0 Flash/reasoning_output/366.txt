PROBLEM 366 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A ship is 27m away from the bottom of a cliff. A lighthouse is located at the top of the cliff. The ship's distance is 34m from the bottom of the lighthouse and 37m from the top of the lighthouse.
Hence find the height of the lighthouse to the nearest tenth of a metre.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: triangle
- Points: Let's assign points A, B, C, and D to the vertices of the triangle. Let A be the ship's location, B be the bottom of the cliff, C be the bottom of the lighthouse, and D be the top of the lighthouse.
- Lines: AB, BC, AC, CD, AD
- Measurements: AB = 27m, AC = 34m, AD = 37m, BC = x, CD = y
- Special markings: Right angle at B (between the cliff and the ground)
- Implied constructions: Triangle ABD with AB = 27, AD = 37, Triangle ABC with AB = 27, AC = 34, Triangle BCD with BC = x, CD = y, BD = x+y, Angle ABC is 90 degrees

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ABC is a right angle.
- Implied perpendicular relationship: BC is perpendicular to AB.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent triangles or equal lengths are explicitly marked, but we know segment lengths.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point B is the intersection of lines AB and BC.
- Point C is the intersection of lines AC and BC.
- Point D is the intersection of lines AD and CD

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Pythagorean theorem can be applied to triangle ABC: AB^2 + BC^2 = AC^2 => 27^2 + x^2 = 34^2
- Pythagorean theorem can be applied to triangle ABD: AB^2 + BD^2 = AD^2 => 27^2 + (x+y)^2 = 37^2
- We have two equations and two unknowns (x and y)

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the height of the lighthouse, which is y.
- We have two Pythagorean equations to solve for x and y.
- All necessary information is present.
