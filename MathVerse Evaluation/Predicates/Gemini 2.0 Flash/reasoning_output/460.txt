PROBLEM 460 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the circle, which has 2 intersection points with axes, on the graph.


Find the centre of the circle. Write your answer in the form ( _ , _ )
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Circle, x and y axes
- Points: Center of the circle is approximately at (-4, -2).
- Lines: x and y axes.
- Measurements: None explicitly provided.
- Markings: Coordinate grid lines.
- Implied Constructions: Radii to intersection points with axes

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The center is located at roughly (-4, -2).
- The circle intersects the x and y axes.
- Radius seems to be approximately 3.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable in this case

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The circle intersects the x and y axes at 2 points.
- The center appears to be roughly at (-4, -2).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
-  The circle's position and radius are constrained by the intersection points with the axes.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to define the circle and its center.
