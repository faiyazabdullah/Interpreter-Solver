PROBLEM 539 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a trigonometric function.
- There are two labeled points on the graph: $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$.
- The graph appears to be a cosine function.
- The minimum point is at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$.
- The maximum point is at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$.
- The period of the function can be determined by finding the distance between two consecutive maximum or minimum points.
- In this case, we can find the horizontal distance between the minimum and maximum points and multiply by 2.
- The x-coordinate of the minimum point is $-\frac{1}{2} \pi$.
- The x-coordinate of the maximum point is $\frac{3}{2} \pi$.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable in this image.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The period is the distance between two consecutive minimum or maximum values. The distance between the x-coordinates of the minimum and maximum points is $\frac{3}{2}\pi - (-\frac{1}{2}\pi) = \frac{3}{2}\pi + \frac{1}{2}\pi = \frac{4}{2}\pi = 2\pi$. Since this is half the period, the period is $2*(2\pi) = 4\pi$.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The relevant information is the location of the minimum and maximum points. The period can be derived from these points.
