PROBLEM 401 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Area of the figure is a $=\frac{3}{4}$ of area of the circle. Calculate the area of the following figure.

Give your answer as an exact value.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a sector of a circle, which is $\frac{3}{4}$ of a full circle.
- The radius of the circle is given as 7 cm.
- There is a right angle indicated at the center of the circle, forming the remaining $\frac{1}{4}$ part.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The figure represents a sector of a circle.
- The radius of the circle is 7 cm.
- The angle of the sector is $270^\circ$ or $\frac{3\pi}{2}$ radians.
- The area of the sector is $\frac{3}{4}$ of the area of the whole circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle at the center of the circle.
- The sector has an angle of $360^\circ - 90^\circ = 270^\circ$.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two radii are equal in length, both 7 cm.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two radii form the boundaries of the sector.
- The arc is part of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the sector is $\frac{3}{4}$ the area of the full circle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The radius is 7 cm.
- The sector covers $\frac{3}{4}$ of the circle's area.
- We have the radius of the circle, which allows us to calculate its area and subsequently the area of the sector.
