PROBLEM 039 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Fold a rectangular piece of paper with equal width as shown in the figure. If angle 1 = 140.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangular piece of paper being folded.
- Angle 1 is given as 140 degrees. We need to find the measure of angle 2.
- When the paper is folded, the angles formed are equal.
- Let's call the angle of fold 'x'. Then Angle 1 + x = 180 (Supplementary Angles). So, x = 180 - 140 = 40.
- The fold creates a straight line.  The unfolded portion means angle x is duplicated. Thus the total amount folded = 2 * x. Then Angle 2 + 2 * x = 180.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 and an adjacent angle form a linear pair (supplementary angles).
- When the paper is folded, the fold line creates two equal angles.
- Angle 2 and two fold angles form a linear pair.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The fold creates congruent angles.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at the fold.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We know that the angles formed by folding are equal. We also know that angles on a straight line sum to 180 degrees.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the key relationships to solve the problem.
