PROBLEM 353 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: An airplane is currently flying 35^\circ  south of east, as shown in the image.

The control tower orders the plane to change course by turning 7^\circ  to the left. How many degrees south of east is the new course that the plane is ordered to fly?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a coordinate system with horizontal and vertical axes intersecting at point O. The vertical axis is labeled N.
- A line OA is drawn in the fourth quadrant, forming an angle of 35^\circ with the horizontal axis.
- The problem statement mentions the plane turning 7^\circ to the left, which implies a counterclockwise rotation.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes are perpendicular to each other, forming a right angle at O.
- The angle between the horizontal axis and line OA is given as 35^\circ.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit congruent or equal marks in the image.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Line OA intersects the axes at point O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The problem describes a rotation of line OA by 7^\circ counterclockwise. This implies a change in the angle between the horizontal axis and the new position of the line. The new angle will be 35^\circ - 7^\circ = 28^\circ.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates will represent the coordinate system, line OA, and the given angle of 35^\circ. This information should be sufficient to perform the calculation described in the problem statement.
