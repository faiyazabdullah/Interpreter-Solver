PROBLEM 115 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Use a sector paper sheet with a central angle of 120.0 and a radius of 6.0 to roll into a conical bottomless paper cap (as shown in the picture), then the bottom perimeter of the paper cap is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sector with radius 6 and central angle 120 degrees.
- The sector is transformed into a cone.
- We need to find the bottom perimeter (circumference) of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The sector is part of a circle.
- When the sector is rolled into a cone, the radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone, which is 6.
- The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The sector has a central angle of 120 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the sector is given as 6.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The ends of the sector's arc meet to form the apex of the cone.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The arc length of the sector is given by (central angle / 360) * (2 * pi * radius).
- Arc length = (120/360) * (2 * pi * 6) = (1/3) * (12 * pi) = 4 * pi.
- This arc length is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.
- Circumference = 2 * pi * r, where r is the radius of the base of the cone.
- Therefore, 2 * pi * r = 4 * pi, so r = 2.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the radius of the sector, the central angle, and the resulting cone's base circumference.
- We have captured the key relationships required.
