PROBLEM 765 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph consists of the rectangle QRPS and the line segment RT, and the point T is on PS. The area of triangle RST is 7 and PT=2/5*PS. What is the area of PQRS?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangle QRPS and a line segment RT.
- The points are Q, R, P, S, and T.
- T is on PS.
- The area of triangle RST is 7.
- PT = (2/5) * PS.
- Angle Q, angle R, angle S, angle P are right angles.
- QR is parallel to PS, QP is parallel to RS.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle Q is a right angle.
- Angle R is a right angle.
- Angle S is a right angle.
- Angle P is a right angle.
- QP is perpendicular to PS.
- QR is perpendicular to RS.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Opposite sides of the rectangle are equal: QR = PS, QP = RS.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point T lies on line segment PS.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of rectangle PQRS is PQ * PS.
- The area of triangle RST is (1/2) * RS * ST.
- We know PT = (2/5) * PS. Therefore, ST = PS - PT = PS - (2/5) * PS = (3/5) * PS.
- Area of triangle RST = (1/2) * RS * ST = (1/2) * PQ * (3/5) * PS = 7.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- I have identified all the shapes, points, lines, and angles.
- I have listed the relationships between the shapes.
- I have included all the information given in the problem.
- The area of triangle RST and PT=2/5*PS is included.
