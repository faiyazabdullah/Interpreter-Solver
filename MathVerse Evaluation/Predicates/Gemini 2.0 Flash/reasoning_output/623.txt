PROBLEM 623 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two piecewirse function $g$ and $f$ are graphed, $g$ is graphed in purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), $f$ is graphed in blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). t is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport.
The airplanes have the same height about 9 minutes after noon.
What is the other time the airplanes have the same height?
Round your answer to the nearest ten minutes.
About _ minutes after noon
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two piecewise linear functions, $f$ and $g$, graphed on a coordinate plane. The x-axis represents time $t$ in minutes since noon. The y-axis represents the height of airplanes. The graph of $g$ is a piecewise linear function passing through the points (0, 10000), (40, 9000), (80, 9000), (100, 11000), and (130, 11000). The graph of $f$ is a piecewise linear function passing through the points (10, 11000), (50, 11000), (60, 10000), (100, 10000), and (120, 0).

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The coordinate axes are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked congruent or equal shapes in the image.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The graphs of the functions $f$ and $g$ intersect.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The graph provides the values of two functions, $f$ and $g$ at different values of $t$.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified all shapes, points, and relationships shown in the diagram.
