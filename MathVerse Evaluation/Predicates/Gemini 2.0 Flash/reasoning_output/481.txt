PROBLEM 481 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the domain and range of the function f using interval notation, which goes through (-2,-4), (-1,-2), (0,0), (1,-4), with a hollow point (-3,0).
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a function f plotted on a coordinate plane.
- Points on the function include approximately (-2,-4), (-1,-2), (0,0), (1,-4). There is a discontinuity at x=-3, denoted by an open circle. The function ends at (1,-4), denoted by a filled circle.
- The x-axis and y-axis are shown. The gridlines are at integer intervals.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The domain of the function appears to start at x = -3 (exclusive, due to the open circle) and ends at x = 1 (inclusive, due to the closed circle).
- The range of the function appears to go from approximately y = -4 to y = 0.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The key relationships needed to determine the domain and range have been identified.

DOMAIN AND RANGE PREDICATES:
Domain: (-3, 1]
Range: [-4, 0]

GEOMETRIC PREDICATES:
PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0),Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-1,-2),Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(-2,-4),Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine(Point(1,-4),Line(x,y))
