PROBLEM 502 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a cubic function that passes (0,0). Find the absolute maximum of the function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: Graph of a cubic function. Key points are identified on the graph. The x and y axes are visible.
- Points: The graph appears to pass through (-3, 0), (0, 0) and (3, 0). There is a local maximum between x = -3 and x = 0, and a local minimum between x = 0 and x = 3.
- Lines: x-axis and y-axis are lines.
- Measurements: No explicit measurements are given. The graph is plotted on a grid.
- Special Markings: The graph is a curve. Arrows indicate the direction of the x and y axes.
- Implied Constructions: The graph implies certain x and y values corresponding to specific points.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
Not applicable, as there are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No explicit congruences are marked. The roots at -3 and 3 suggest some symmetry with respect to the y-axis when shifted to have its x-intercept at x=0.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The function intersects x-axis at (-3, 0), (0, 0), and (3, 0). It passes through the origin.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The function is a cubic function that has the roots x = -3, x = 0 and x = 3. This implies the equation is of the form f(x) = ax(x - 3)(x + 3) = a(x^3 - 9x). We want to find the absolute maximum.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The points (-3, 0), (0, 0), (3, 0) lie on the graph of a cubic function. The function passes through the origin. This is sufficient to define the cubic function f(x) = a(x^3 - 9x) and find the absolute maximum.
