PROBLEM 340 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the following diagram. Triangle ABC formed by the dashed line, angle A is 49° and angle B is 41°.

Find the true bearing of point B from point C.
Choice:
A. 053 ^\circ T
B. 082 ^\circ T
C. 045 ^\circ T
D. 037 ^\circ T

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Points A, B, C. Dashed Lines AB, AC, BC. Vertical and horizontal lines intersecting at A, B, and C. Angles at A and B are labeled as 45° and 37° respectively.
- Points: A, B, C.
- Lines: AB, AC, BC (dashed lines), several lines forming crosses centered at A, B, C.
- Measurements: Angle at A = 45°, Angle at B = 37°.
- Special markings: Arrows along the dashed lines, indicating direction. There is an indication of North at points A and B.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BAC is 45 degrees.
- Angle ABC is 37 degrees.
- Lines intersecting at A, B, and C appear perpendicular. The vertical lines point to North. The angles between AB and the north directions are labeled.
- Angle ACB can be determined using triangle property sum of angles in a triangle.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is formed by dashed lines.
- The problem asks for the true bearing of point B from point C. This means we need to find the angle between the line pointing North from C and the line CB.
- Need to calculate angle ACB first.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The diagram provides the necessary information to solve for angle ACB using the property of triangles.
- The angles and relationships are sufficient.
