PROBLEM 568 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes (circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.)
The image contains two parabolas. Let's denote the blue parabola as 'f' and the red parabola as 'g'. The coordinate axes are visible.
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names
The functions are labeled as 'f' and 'g'. The x and y axes are present. We can observe the vertex of 'f' is at (0, 0). The vertex of 'g' is at (-3, -5).
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values
The grid provides a scale. The y-intercept of 'f' is at (0, 0). The vertex of 'g' appears to be at (-3, -5).
- Identify ALL special markings (right angle symbols, parallel marks, congruent marks, equal marks, etc.)
There are no explicit markings for right angles or congruence. However, the grid lines imply right angles for the coordinate system.
- Look for implied constructions (perpendiculars, bisectors, tangents, chords, radii, etc.)
The coordinate axes are perpendicular.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS (Not Applicable)
There are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Examine ALL angles shown in the diagram, both marked and unmarked
The coordinate axes form right angles.
- Look for right angle indicators or perpendicular relationships
The coordinate axes are perpendicular.
- Check for angle bisectors or special angle relationships
There are no marked angle bisectors.
- Identify complementary, supplementary, or vertical angles
There are no complementary or supplementary angles explicitly visible.
- Look for inscribed angles and their corresponding arcs
Not applicable as there are no circles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL equal lengths, angles, or shapes (look for tick marks, identical measurements)
The shape of the parabola 'f' is similar to the shape of parabola 'g', suggesting a translation.
- Check for congruent triangles or similar figures
No triangles or similar figures are present other than the parabolas.
- Look for equal radii in circles
Not applicable.
- Identify parallel lines or equal distances
The grid lines imply equal distances along both axes.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Determine where lines intersect and at what points
The parabolas do not intersect in the visible area.
- Check if points lie on specific lines or circles
Not applicable.
- Identify midpoints, centroids, or other special points
The vertex of 'f' is at the origin (0, 0). The vertex of 'g' appears to be at (-3, -5).
- Look for points that divide segments in specific ratios
Not applicable.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Combine observations to identify implicit relationships
The parabola 'g' is a translation of parabola 'f'.
- Look for theorem applications (Pythagorean, inscribed angle, etc.)
Not applicable.
- Identify geometric constructions that create specific relationships
The translation of 'f' creates 'g'.
- Check for properties that follow from the given constraints
The translation means 'g(x) = f(x + 3) - 5'.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured
The vertex points of both parabolas have been identified, along with the fact that 'g' is a translation of 'f'.
- Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented
The translation relationship is key.
- Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed
No critical properties are missed.
- Confirm that the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving
The predicates will capture all necessary information for a solver.
