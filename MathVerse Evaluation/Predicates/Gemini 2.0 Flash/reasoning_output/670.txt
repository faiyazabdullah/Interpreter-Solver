PROBLEM 670 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A solid consists of a cylinder (of radius 5mm and height 11mm) attached to a rectangular prism on one of its faces. The rectangular prism has sides of length 21mm, 10mm and 65mm. We wish to find the surface area of the entire solid. Note that an area is called 'exposed' if it is not covered by the other object.
What is the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism? Give your answer correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows a rectangular prism and a cylinder.
- Measurements:
  - Rectangular prism: length = 65mm, width = 21mm, height = 10mm
  - Cylinder: radius = 5mm, height = 11mm
- The cylinder is placed on top of the rectangular prism.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The cylinder has a radius of 5mm. The circular face of the cylinder is in contact with the rectangular prism.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangular prism has right angles at all its corners.
- The cylinder is placed upright on the rectangular prism, forming a perpendicular relationship with the top face of the prism.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The opposite faces of the rectangular prism are congruent.
- The circular faces of the cylinder are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The cylinder is placed on the top face of the rectangular prism.
- The center of the circular base of the cylinder lies on the top face of the rectangular prism.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of the circular base of the cylinder covers a portion of the top face of the rectangular prism. This area is not 'exposed'.
- We are interested in the exposed surface area of the rectangular prism.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the shapes, their dimensions, and the relationship between them.
