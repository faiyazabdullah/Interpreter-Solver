PROBLEM 479 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a curve that goes through (-3,0), (-2,1), and (-1,2). Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- I see a curve on a coordinate plane. The curve passes through the points approximately (-3,0), (-2,1), (-1,2), (0, 2.25), and (1, 2.5), (2, 2.75), and (3,2.85)
- There are x and y axes.
- I will analyze if this curve represents a one-to-one function.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- To determine if the curve is a function, I must represent it as a relation, noting its points.
- A function must have each x value map to only one y-value. Since this is a continuous curve, there are infinite x-values mapping to some y values.
- To determine if this relation is one-to-one, it must pass both the vertical and horizontal line tests.
- If any horizontal line intersects the curve more than once, the function is not one-to-one.
