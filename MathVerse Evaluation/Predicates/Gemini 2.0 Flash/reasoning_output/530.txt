PROBLEM 530 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the midline equation of the function?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a trigonometric function graph.
- We have a maximum point at (π/4, -2.2) and a minimum point at (3π/4, -8.5).
- We need to find the midline equation of the function.

STEP 2: Midline calculation
- The midline is the horizontal line midway between the maximum and minimum values.
- Midline y = (maximum y + minimum y) / 2 = (-2.2 + (-8.5)) / 2 = -10.7 / 2 = -5.35
