PROBLEM 077 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, if angle 1 = angle 3, angle 2 = 60.0, then the degree of angle 4 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two sets of parallel lines intersected by two transversals. We have angles labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, along with a 60-degree angle. We are given that angle 1 = angle 3 and angle 2 = 60 degrees.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle 2 is given as 60 degrees. Angle 3 and the 60-degree angle are corresponding angles, which means the lines they lie on are parallel. Angles 1 and 3 are equal. Angle 4 and the angle vertically opposite to angle 2 are corresponding angles.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
We are given that angle 1 = angle 3 and angle 2 = 60 degrees. Since the two lines are parallel, angle 2 and its corresponding angle are equal. Angle 4 and the vertically opposite angle of angle 2 are corresponding angles, so those are equal as well.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The lines intersect at various points, forming the angles mentioned above.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The figure shows parallel lines cut by transversals. Corresponding angles are equal. Vertical angles are equal. Since angle 1 = angle 3, the two lines intersected by the transversals are parallel.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The provided constraints should allow solving the problem. Angle 2 and angle 4 should be supplementary, thus angle 4 can be derived by subtracting the measure of angle 2 from 180 degrees.
