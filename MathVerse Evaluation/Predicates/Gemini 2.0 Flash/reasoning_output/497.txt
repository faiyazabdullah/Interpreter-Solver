PROBLEM 497 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a linear function with a y-intercept of 3 and a x-intercept of 2. Determine the function expression of f shown in the figure.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a linear function f on a coordinate plane.
- The linear function intersects the y-axis at (0, 3) and the x-axis at (2, 0).
- The function appears to be a straight line.
- No specific angle markings are given.
- The graph shows the line extending in both directions, implying it continues.
- I will label the points on the axes where the line intersects as A(0,3) and B(2,0).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit angle markings, but the coordinate axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit markings for congruent lengths or angles

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the y-axis at (0, 3).
- The line intersects the x-axis at (2, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The line's equation can be determined using the two points (0, 3) and (2, 0). The slope is (0-3)/(2-0) = -3/2.
- The y-intercept is 3.
- The equation of the line is y = (-3/2)x + 3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All points and relationships are represented. The intercepts and the line are present.
