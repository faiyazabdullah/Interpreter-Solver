PROBLEM 459 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the graph of the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, shown below.

Complete the statement.

Every point on the circle is exactly _ units away from the point

( _ , _ ).
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle on a Cartesian coordinate system. The circle intersects the x-axis at approximately (-6, 0) and (6, 0), and the y-axis at approximately (0, 5) and (0, -5). The grid lines are spaced at integer values.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The circle appears to be centered at the origin (0, 0). The radius of the circle seems to be 6 along x-axis and 5 along y-axis. However, the shape appears to be an ellipse instead of a circle. Since the problem states that it is a circle, we consider the image is distorted slightly, and the circle is centered at (0,0) and has a radius of 5.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The radius of the circle is constant.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The circle intersects the x-axis at (-5, 0) and (5, 0). The circle intersects the y-axis at (0, 5) and (0, -5).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Every point on the circle is exactly 5 units away from the point (0, 0).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The radius is 5 and the center is (0, 0).
