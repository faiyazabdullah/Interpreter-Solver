PROBLEM 528 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Points $A, B$, and $C$ are plotted on the unit circle and also on the x-axis and y-axis. Which of the coordinates is equal to $\cos (\pi)$ ?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle centered at the origin (0,0) of a Cartesian coordinate system. The circle intersects the x-axis at points A and C, and the y-axis at point B. The coordinates of A are (1,0), B are (0,1), and C are (-1,0). The circle appears to be a unit circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The center of the circle is at the origin. Points A, B, and C lie on the circle. The lines from the origin to A, B, and C are radii of the circle. Line segment AC is a diameter of the circle. Since A is at (1,0), B is at (0,1), and C is at (-1,0), the radius of the circle is 1.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular. Therefore, angle between the x-axis and the y-axis is 90 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The radii OA, OB, and OC are all equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Point A is the intersection of the circle and the x-axis. Point B is the intersection of the circle and the y-axis. Point C is the intersection of the circle and the x-axis.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since the circle is centered at the origin and the x-axis is a horizontal line through the origin, the y-axis is a vertical line through the origin. Thus, the x and y axes are perpendicular. The points A, B, and C lie on the circle, and their coordinates are (1,0), (0,1), and (-1,0) respectively.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified all points, lines, and the circle. We have also noted the radius of the circle to be 1.
