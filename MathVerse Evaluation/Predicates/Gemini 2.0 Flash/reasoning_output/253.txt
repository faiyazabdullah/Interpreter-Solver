PROBLEM 253 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A B is a diameter, A C = 8 inches, and B C = 15 inches. Find the radius of the circle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with diameter AB.
- A triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle.
- The length of side AC is given as 8 inches.
- The length of side BC is given as 15 inches.
- Since AB is a diameter and C is a point on the circle, angle ACB is a right angle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The circle has a diameter AB.
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.
- AB is the diameter of the circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ACB is a right angle because it is inscribed in a semicircle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal segments are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AC and BC intersect at point C.
- Line AB intersects the circle at A and B.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle with hypotenuse AB.
- By Pythagorean theorem, AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2.
- AB is the diameter of the circle.
- Radius is half of the diameter.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the necessary information is captured: the lengths of the two legs of the right triangle, and the knowledge that the hypotenuse is the diameter.
