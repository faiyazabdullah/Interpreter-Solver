PROBLEM 047 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the straight line AB parallel CD, angle C = 44.0, angle E is a right angle, then angle 1 is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: lines, angles
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: AB, CD, AE, EC
- Angles: Angle 1, Angle C, Angle AEC, Angle BAE
- Measurements: Angle C = 44 degrees, Angle AEC = 90 degrees
- Special markings: AB is parallel to CD, Angle AEC is a right angle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AEC is a right angle, meaning AE is perpendicular to EC.
- Angle C is given as 44 degrees.
- Angle 1 is the exterior angle to Angle BAE.
- Since AB is parallel to CD, alternate interior angles are equal.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- We are looking for relationships to find the value of angle 1.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AE and EC intersect at point E.
- Line AB and AE intersect at point A.
- Line CD and EC intersect at point C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is parallel to CD, the angle between AE and CD plus angle BAE is equal to 180 degrees.
- Angle AEC is 90, so angle CAE = 90 - Angle C = 90 - 44 = 46
- Angle BAE + Angle CAE + Angle 1 = 180 (linear pair)

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to express all relationships in predicates.

PREDICATES:

Point(B)
Point(C)
Point(D)

Parallel(Line(A,B),Line(C,D))
RightAngle(Angle(A,E,C))
