PROBLEM 744 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere is given by the formula:

V=\frac{1}{4}\pi h\left(4r^2-h^2\right)

where r is the radius of the sphere and h is the height of the cylinder.

What is the radius of the sphere if the volume of the cylinder is 13.75\pi cm3 and the height of the cylinder is 5 cm?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image contains a circle and a cylinder inscribed within it. The cylinder has height 'h' and the sphere has radius 'r'.
- Measurements: The height of the cylinder, h = 5 cm, is given.
- Implied Relationships: The center of the sphere is also the midpoint of the cylinder's axis. The radius of the sphere extends from the center to the edge of the cylinder.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: The center of the sphere lies on the axis of symmetry of the cylinder.
- Radius: The radius of the sphere (r) is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg being h/2 and the other being the radius of the cylinder's base.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit angles are given, but the height of the cylinder is assumed to be perpendicular to the circular bases.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruent relationships are given.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The cylinder is inscribed in the sphere.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Pythagorean theorem could be used to relate r, h, and the cylinder's base radius if it were needed.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image and given information are sufficient to extract the relevant geometric properties.
