PROBLEM 218 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot O, the diameter is 14, and \angle A O B is 80 degrees. Find the length of \widehat A B. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center O.
- Points A and B lie on the circle.
- Line segments OA and OB are radii of the circle.
- Angle AOB is a central angle.
- The length of the diameter is given as 14 m.
- The measure of angle AOB is given as 80 degrees.
- There's an arc AB.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle with center O.
- Points A and B are on the circle.
- OA and OB are radii.
- IsDiameterOf(Line($),Circle(O)) can be inferred. Then we also know that 2*radius = diameter.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AOB is given as 80 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA and OB are radii, so they are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The length of arc AB can be found using the formula: arc length = (central angle/360) * (2 * pi * radius)

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is present to determine the arc length.
