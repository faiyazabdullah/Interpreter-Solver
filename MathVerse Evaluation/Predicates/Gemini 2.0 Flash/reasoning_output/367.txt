PROBLEM 367 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Sand has an angle of friction of about 40Â°. This means once it gets over this it slides down the side of the sand pile. Mae is getting a delivery of sand to her home, but the area where the sand will be delivered is only 10.6 metres wide. If h metres is the maximum height of the sandpile, find h to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle formed by the sand pile and the horizontal base.
- There is an angle of 40 degrees shown.
- The base of the triangle is 10.6 m.
- The height of the triangle is labelled as 'h'.
- The triangle is not necessarily a right-angled triangle, but we can use trigonometry.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- One angle is given as 40 degrees.
- There might be a right angle implied between the height 'h' and the base. Let us assume it is.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked congruent parts.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- We can define the vertices of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use the tangent of the angle to relate the height 'h' to the base.
- The horizontal base is 10.6 metres wide so, assuming the height bisects the base line, the distance from one end of the base to the midpoint is 10.6 / 2 = 5.3m
- The tangent of 40 degrees will then equal h/5.3
- Therefore, h = 5.3 * tan(40)

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have captured all the necessary information to form the appropriate predicates.
