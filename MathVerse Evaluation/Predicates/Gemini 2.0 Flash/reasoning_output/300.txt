PROBLEM 300 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right triangle, the two sides are y and 12 with an altitude of x. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There is a large triangle, which appears to be a right triangle.
- There is an altitude to the hypotenuse dividing the original triangle into two smaller right triangles.
- The altitude is labeled as x.
- The legs of the two smaller right triangles are labeled as y, z, 10 and 12.
- There are right angle markings where the altitude meets the hypotenuse, and at one vertex of the large triangle.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is one right angle marked in the original triangle, where sides x and y meet.
- The altitude x is perpendicular to the base of the original triangle (z + 10).

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The three triangles are all similar.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The altitude divides the base of the large triangle into two segments of lengths z and 10.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Using similar triangles, we can deduce some relationships between the side lengths.
- The original large triangle has legs of length y, z+10 and hypotenuse 12.
- The two smaller triangles have a leg length x.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to capture similar triangle relations and right angle relations.
