PROBLEM 620 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: This graph shows the relationship between the current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms) in an electrical circuit, when the voltage provided to the circuit is 240 V. The equation could be described as \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}}=\text{Current}

What happens to the current as the resistance increases?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with the relationship between current (amperes) and resistance (ohms).
- The equation \text{Current} = \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}} is given.
- As resistance increases, current decreases.
- The x-axis represents Resistance (ohms), and the y-axis represents Current (amperes).
- There is a curve plotted on the graph.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- As resistance increases, the current decreases.
- The equation is a relationship between the current and the resistance.
