================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, PA and PB are tangent to circle O at A and B respectively. If angle C = 65.0, then the degree of angle P is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Circle, triangles, quadrilaterals.
- Points: A, B, C, O, P.
- Lines: PA, PB, OA, OB, AB, AC, BC.
- Angles: Angle C = 65 degrees, Angle P (unknown).
- Special markings: PA and PB are tangents to circle O at A and B respectively.
- Implied constructions: OA and OB are radii. OA is perpendicular to PA, OB is perpendicular to PB.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: O.
- Points on the circle: A, B, C.
- Radii: OA, OB.
- Tangents: PA, PB.
- Chord: AB.
- Inscribed Angle: Angle ACB.
- Central Angle: Angle AOB.
- Relationship: MeasureOf(Angle(AOB)) = 2 * MeasureOf(Angle(ACB)).

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ACB = 65 degrees.
- OA is perpendicular to PA, therefore Angle OAP = 90 degrees.
- OB is perpendicular to PB, therefore Angle OBP = 90 degrees.
- AOBP is a quadrilateral.
- Angle AOB = 2 * Angle ACB = 2 * 65 = 130 degrees.
- Sum of angles in quadrilateral AOBP is 360 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB (radii).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- PA and PB intersect at P.
- OA and PA intersect at A.
- OB and PB intersect at B.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- PA and PB are tangents, OA and OB are radii, therefore angle OAP = angle OBP = 90.
- In quadrilateral AOBP, Angle(AOB) + Angle(OAP) + Angle(OBP) + Angle(P) = 360.
- Angle(AOB) = 2 * Angle(C)
- From above, Angle(P) = 360 - Angle(AOB) - Angle(OAP) - Angle(OBP) = 360 - 130 - 90 - 90 = 50.
