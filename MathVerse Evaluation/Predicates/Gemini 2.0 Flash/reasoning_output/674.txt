PROBLEM 674 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A cylinder with a radius of 2.5cm and a height of 10cm contains two identical spherical balls that fit exactly inside it. What is the surface area of each ball? Give your answer correct to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a cylinder and two spherical balls inside the cylinder.
- The cylinder has a height of 10cm and a diameter of 2.5cm.
- The two spherical balls are identical and fit exactly inside the cylinder.
- The height of the cylinder is equal to twice the diameter of each sphere. Therefore, the diameter of each sphere is 5cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The diameter of the cylinder is 2.5 cm, so the radius is 2.5/2 = 1.25 cm.
- Since the balls fit exactly, the diameter of each ball is half the height of the cylinder, i.e., 10/2 = 5 cm.
- So the radius of each ball is 5/2 = 2.5 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked angles. The sides of the cylinder are perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two spherical balls are identical, so they are congruent. Their radii are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The spheres are inside the cylinder.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The diameter of the cylinder is also the diameter of the balls.
The height of the cylinder is equal to twice the diameter of the balls.
The radius of the cylinder is 1.25 cm.
The radius of each ball is 2.5 cm.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The problem asks for the surface area of one of the balls. We have found that the radius of each ball is 2.5 cm. This should be enough to calculate the surface area of the ball. The surface area of a sphere is given by 4*pi*r^2, where r is the radius.
