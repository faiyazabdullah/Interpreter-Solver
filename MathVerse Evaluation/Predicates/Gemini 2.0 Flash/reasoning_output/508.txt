PROBLEM 508 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the graph of the line whose x-intercept is 0.5 and y-intercept is 2. What is the slope of the line?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: The image shows a line in a 2D coordinate system.
- Points: x-intercept (0.5, 0), y-intercept (0, 2). Let's call these A(0.5,0) and B(0,2)
- Lines: A line passing through points (0.5, 0) and (0, 2).
- Measurements: x-intercept = 0.5, y-intercept = 2
- Special markings: None
- Implied constructions: None

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked angles or perpendicularity.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There is no indication of congruent figures or equality of lengths.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the x-axis at (0.5, 0) and the y-axis at (0, 2).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We have a line and its intercepts.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the intercepts, which are sufficient to find the slope.
