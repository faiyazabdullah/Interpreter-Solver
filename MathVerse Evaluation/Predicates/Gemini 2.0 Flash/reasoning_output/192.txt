PROBLEM 192 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, point P is outside circle O. PA and PB are connected. the straight lines PA and PB are the two tangents of circle O. If angle APB = 120.0, the radius of circle O is 10.0, then the length of chord AB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a circle, two tangent lines PA and PB, and a chord AB.
- Points: P, A, B, O (center of the circle)
- Lines: PA, PB, OA, OB, AB
- Angle APB is given as 120 degrees.
- Radius of the circle is given as 10.
- PA and PB are tangent to the circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- O is the center of the circle.
- A and B are points on the circle.
- OA and OB are radii of the circle.
- AB is a chord.
- PA and PB are tangents to the circle at A and B respectively.
- OA is perpendicular to PA.
- OB is perpendicular to PB.
- Length of OA = length of OB = 10.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle APB = 120 degrees.
- Angle OAP = Angle OBP = 90 degrees (tangent-radius property).
- Triangle OAP and OBP are right triangles.
- Angle AOB is a central angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB (radii of the same circle).
- PA = PB (tangents from the same point to a circle are equal).
- Triangle OAP is congruent to triangle OBP (RHS congruence).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- PA and PB intersect at P.
- OA and PA intersect at A.
- OB and PB intersect at B.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since PA and PB are tangents, OA is perpendicular to PA and OB is perpendicular to PB.
- Since triangle OAP is congruent to triangle OBP, angle APO = angle BPO = 120/2 = 60 degrees.
- In right triangle OAP, we can use trigonometric ratios to find PA.
- We can find angle AOB using the fact that the sum of angles in quadrilateral OAPB is 360 degrees.
- Angle AOB = 360 - 90 - 90 - 120 = 60 degrees.
- Since OA = OB, triangle OAB is isosceles. Since angle AOB = 60, triangle OAB is equilateral, so AB = OA = OB = 10.
- Angle OAP = 90

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have captured all necessary information: radii, tangent lines, angles, perpendicular relationships, and equality of lengths.
