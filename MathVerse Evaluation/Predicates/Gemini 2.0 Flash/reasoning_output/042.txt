PROBLEM 042 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The figure is a schematic diagram of a kite stand made by Xiao Liu. It is known that BC parallel PQ, AB:AP = 2.0:5.0, AQ = 20.0, then the length of CQ is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: We have a triangle with two lines parallel to one of its sides.
- List points: A, B, C, P, Q
- List lines: AB, AP, AC, AQ, BC, PQ
- Measurements: AQ = 20.0, AB:AP = 2.0:5.0
- Special markings: BC parallel to PQ

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No right angles or perpendiculars are marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal shapes are marked

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- B lies on AP
- C lies on AQ

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- BC parallel to PQ implies that Triangle ABC is similar to Triangle APQ.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to express the ratio AB:AP and use similarity to find CQ.
