PROBLEM 315 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the perimeter of the isosceles triangle in yellow with a base length 3.5 ft. Round to the nearest hundredth.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows an isosceles triangle.
- One angle is labeled as 48 degrees.
- The base of the triangle is labeled as 3.5 ft.
- Two sides of the triangle are marked as equal.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle is isosceles, meaning the two base angles are equal.
- Let the base angles be x.  Then 48 + x + x = 180. 2x = 132, x = 66. The base angles are 66 degrees each.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two sides marked with pink are congruent.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the base of the isosceles triangle. We need to find the length of the two equal sides.
- We can use the law of sines to find the equal sides. Let side = s.
- s / sin(66) = 3.5 / sin(48)
- s = 3.5 * sin(66) / sin(48)

STEP 6: Calculation of equal sides:
s = 3.5 * 0.9135 / 0.7431
s = 4.3 ft

STEP 7: Calculation of perimeter:
3.  5 + 4.3 + 4.3 = 12.1 ft
