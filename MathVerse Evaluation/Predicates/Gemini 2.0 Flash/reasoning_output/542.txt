PROBLEM 542 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 3.3\right)$, and it has a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 9.8)$. What is the amplitude of the function?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a graph of a trigonometric function. We can see two points on the graph: $(-2\pi, 9.8)$ which is a maximum point, and $(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 3.3)$ which lies on the midline of the graph. The midline is also indicated by a dashed horizontal line at y = 3.3. The x-axis ranges from -14 to 14 and the y-axis ranges from -6 to 12.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked angles or perpendicular relationships. However, the midline of a trigonometric function is horizontal, so it is perpendicular to the y-axis.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked congruent or equal elements. The midline is at y = 3.3. The maximum value of the trigonometric function is at y = 9.8.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The point $(-2\pi, 9.8)$ is a maximum point on the graph. The point $(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 3.3)$ lies on the midline (y = 3.3) of the graph.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The amplitude of the trigonometric function is the distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum value.
Amplitude = Maximum Value - Midline Value

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The image provides enough information to find the amplitude of the function, which is the difference between the y-value of the maximum point and the y-value of the midline.
