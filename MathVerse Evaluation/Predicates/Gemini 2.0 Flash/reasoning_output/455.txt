PROBLEM 455 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the diameter.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle drawn on a coordinate plane.
- The circle intersects the x-axis at (-4,0) and (4,0).
- The circle intersects the y-axis at (0,-4) and (0,4).
- The center of the circle appears to be at (0,0).
- The radius of the circle is 4.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The center of the circle is at (0,0).
- Points (-4,0), (4,0), (0,-4), and (0,4) lie on the circle.
- The diameter of the circle is the line segment connecting (-4,0) and (4,0), or the line segment connecting (0,-4) and (0,4).
- The radius is 4.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius of the circle is constant.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes intersect at (0,0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The circle is centered at the origin.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information provided is sufficient to determine the diameter.
