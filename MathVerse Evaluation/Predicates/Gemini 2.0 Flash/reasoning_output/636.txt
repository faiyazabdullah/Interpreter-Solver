PROBLEM 636 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diagram shows a cone with a slant height of 13 m and a perpendicular height of 12 m. The radius of the base of the cone is denoted by $r$.

Find the value of $r$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a cone. The base of the cone is a circle with center O and radius r. The height of the cone is 12 m, and the slant height is 13 m. The height is perpendicular to the base at point O. A right triangle is formed by the height, radius, and slant height of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The base of the cone is a circle with center O and radius r.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The angle between the height of the cone and the radius of the base is a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no congruent or equal lengths or angles marked in the diagram, other than the implied radii of the base circle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The height of the cone intersects the base at the center O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The height, radius, and slant height of the cone form a right triangle. The Pythagorean theorem can be applied to find the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The image provides the height (12 m) and slant height (13 m) of the cone. We are asked to find the radius (r). The key relationship is the right triangle formed by the height, radius, and slant height. The predicates will provide the necessary information for solving the problem using the Pythagorean theorem.
