PROBLEM 438 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a hyperbola in blue with two vertices highlighted at (2,-3) and (-8,-3). It's center is at (-3,-3) highlighted by orange and its Foci is also hightlighted in lightgreen at ($-3-5\sqrt{2}$,-3) and ($-3+5\sqrt{2}$,-3). Find the equation of the hyperbola.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a hyperbola opening horizontally. The center, vertices, and foci are labeled with their coordinates. The center is at (-3,-3), the vertices are at (-8,-3) and (2,-3), and the foci are at (-3-5sqrt(2),-3) and (-3+5sqrt(2),-3). The x and y axes are shown.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The distance from the center to each vertex is the same, and the distance from the center to each focus is the same.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The center, vertices, and foci all lie on the line y = -3.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The hyperbola opens horizontally, and its center is not at the origin. We can find a, b, and c from the coordinates of the center, vertices, and foci.
a is the distance from the center to a vertex. a = 5.
c is the distance from the center to a focus. c = $5\sqrt{2}$.
$b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = (5\sqrt{2})^2 - 5^2 = 50 - 25 = 25$. So b=5.
The equation is $\frac{(x+3)^2}{25} - \frac{(y+3)^2}{25} = 1$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All necessary points are labeled and their relationships are specified.
