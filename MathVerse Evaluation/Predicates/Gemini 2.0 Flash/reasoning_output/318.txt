PROBLEM 318 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The figure shows three parallel horizontal lines, with a diagonal line running through them on the left and a vertical line on the right. The diagonal line on the left intersects with three horizontal lines, with a length of 2x+6 for the lower section and 20-5x for the upper section. The vertical line on the right intersects with three horizontal lines, with a length of y for the upper section and 3/5y+2 for the lower section. The two short line segments cut by the left line are of equal length, and the two short line segments cut by the right line are of equal lengthFind y.

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains three parallel horizontal lines intersected by a diagonal line on the left and a vertical line on the right.
- Measurements are provided for the segments created by the intersections.
- There are tick marks indicating equal lengths on segments cut by the diagonal and vertical lines.
- Let's denote the horizontal lines from top to bottom as l1, l2, and l3.
- Let's denote the diagonal line as d and the vertical line as v.
- The length of the segment of line d between l1 and l2 is given as 20-5x.
- The length of the segment of line d between l2 and l3 is given as 2x+6.
- The length of the segment of line v between l1 and l2 is given as y.
- The length of the segment of line v between l2 and l3 is given as 3/5y+2.
- The equal tick marks indicate that the segment of d between l1 and l2 has the same length as the segment of d between l2 and l3.
- Similarly, the segment of v between l1 and l2 has the same length as the segment of v between l2 and l3.

STEP 2: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The equal tick marks on the diagonal indicate the length of the segment between lines l1 and l2 is equal to the length of the segment between lines l2 and l3. Therefore, 20-5x = 2x+6
- The equal tick marks on the vertical line indicate that the length of the segment between lines l1 and l2 is equal to the length of the segment between lines l2 and l3. Therefore, y = 3/5y+2

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The relationships identified above are the key constraints. We have two equations and two unknowns (x and y).
