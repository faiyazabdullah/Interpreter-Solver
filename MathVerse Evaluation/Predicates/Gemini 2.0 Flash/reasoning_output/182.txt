PROBLEM 182 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, angle XOY = 45.0, the two vertices A and B of a right triangle ABC move on OX and OY respectively, where AB = 10.0, then the maximum value of the distance from point O to vertex A is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: lines, angles, right triangle, implicit right angle
- List all points: O, X, Y, A, B, C
- Measurements: Angle XOY = 45 degrees, AB = 10
- Special markings: Right angle at C in triangle ABC

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle XOY = 45 degrees
- Triangle ABC is a right triangle, so angle ACB = 90 degrees.
- Point A lies on line OX, point B lies on line OY
- We want to maximize OA.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB = 10

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point A lies on line OX.
- Point B lies on line OY.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We have triangle OAB. Let angle OAB be $\theta$.
- Let OA = x. Then OB = x*tan(45) = x.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured
- Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented
- Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed
