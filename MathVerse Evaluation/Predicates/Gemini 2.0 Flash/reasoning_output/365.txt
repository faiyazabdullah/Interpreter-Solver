PROBLEM 365 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The airtraffic controller is communicating with a plane in flight approaching an airport for landing. The plane is 10369 metres above the ground and is still 23444 metres from the runway. If \theta ° is the angle at which the plane should approach, find \theta  to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Triangle: A right triangle is formed by the plane's height above ground, its distance from the runway, and the line of sight.
- Lines: There is a horizontal line representing the distance from the plane to the runway (23444 m), a vertical line representing the plane's height (10369 m), and a line of sight forming the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- Angle: There is an angle labeled θ° at the bottom left.
- Measurements: The vertical side is 10369 m, and the horizontal side is 23444 m.
- Right Angle: The vertical line (height) and the horizontal line (distance to runway) form a right angle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle θ° is one of the acute angles in the right triangle.
- The angle between the ground and the vertical height is a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable here.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect to form a right triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The tangent of θ° is the ratio of the opposite side (height) to the adjacent side (distance to runway).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The height and distance from the runway are known. The angle θ° is unknown and is part of a right triangle.
