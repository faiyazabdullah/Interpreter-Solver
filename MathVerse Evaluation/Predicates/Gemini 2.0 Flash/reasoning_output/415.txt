PROBLEM 415 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of the figure is $22.1\mathrm{~m}$. Calculate the area of the following sector.

Round your answer to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a sector of a circle with a radius of 22.1 m and a central angle of 74 degrees. We need to calculate the area of this sector.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The image shows a sector. The radius is given as 22.1 m.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The central angle is given as 74 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two radii are equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The two radii intersect at the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Area of sector = (angle/360) * pi * r^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have the radius and the angle and the shape identified.

PREDICATES:
Shape(Sector(O,A,B))
MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,B),74)
LengthOf(Line(O,A),22.1)
LengthOf(Line(O,B),22.1)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,A)),LengthOf(Line(O,B)))
IsRadiusOf(Line(O,A),Circle(O))
IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B),Circle(O))
