PROBLEM 362 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The final approach of an aeroplane when landing requires the pilot to adjust their angle of descent to about 3Â°. If the plane is 12 metres above the runway and has d metres until touchdown, find d to the nearest metre.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a triangle, a horizontal line representing the runway, a vertical line representing the height of the plane, and an angle of 3 degrees.
- There is a right angle between the runway line and the vertical line.
- The height of the plane is 12 metres.
- The horizontal distance from the point directly below the plane to the touchdown point is d metres.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle.
- There is an angle measuring 3 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly congruent figures.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect to form a right triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The figure forms a right triangle, so trigonometric relationships apply.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information provided is sufficient to generate predicates related to the trigonometry of the right triangle.
