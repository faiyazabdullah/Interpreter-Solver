PROBLEM 627 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is greater than 0. It intersects the x-axis and the y-axis at (0,-4). Consider the graph of $y=x-4$.

State the coordinates of the $x$-intercept in the form $(a, b)$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a line in a Cartesian coordinate system.
- The line is labeled with the equation y = x - 4.
- The line intersects the x-axis at some point (a, 0).
- The line intersects the y-axis at (0, -4).
- The line slopes upward from left to right, indicating a positive slope.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes are perpendicular to each other.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal geometric elements are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects both the x-axis and y-axis.
- The y-intercept is at (0, -4).
- The x-intercept is the point where y = 0. Substituting y = 0 into y = x - 4, we get 0 = x - 4, so x = 4. Therefore, the x-intercept is at (4, 0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The equation of the line is given as y = x - 4.
- The x-intercept occurs when y = 0.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to identify the x-intercept coordinates (a, 0). From the equation, we found a = 4. The x-intercept coordinates are (4, 0).
