PROBLEM 786 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, P, Q, and R lie on the same line. P is the center of the larger circle, and Q is the center of the smaller circle. If the radius of the larger circle is 4, what is the radius of the smaller circle?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two circles, a larger circle and a smaller circle. The smaller circle is internally tangent to the larger circle at point P. The center of the larger circle is P, and the center of the smaller circle is Q. Points P, Q, and R lie on the same line. The radius of the larger circle is 4.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle 1: Center P, radius = 4
- Circle 2: Center Q, point R lies on the circle.
- The line segment PR is a diameter of the larger circle.
- The line segment QR is a radius of the smaller circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
No angles are explicitly marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The length of the radius of the larger circle is 4.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Points P, Q, and R lie on the same line. The smaller circle is tangent to the larger circle at point P.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since P, Q, and R lie on the same line, and the smaller circle is tangent to the larger circle at P, the length of PQ plus the length of QR equals the length of PR (which is the diameter of the larger circle and twice its radius).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have captured the key relationships and measurements necessary to determine the radius of the smaller circle.
