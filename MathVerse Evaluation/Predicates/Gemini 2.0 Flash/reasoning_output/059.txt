PROBLEM 059 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, AD bisects angle BAC, and angle C = 80.0, then the degree of angle D is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: lines, angles, triangle
- Points: A, B, C, D
- Measurements: Angle C = 80 degrees
- Special markings: AB parallel to CD, AD bisects angle BAC
- Implied constructions: None

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles in the diagram

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle C is given as 80 degrees.
- AD bisects angle BAC, meaning angle BAD is equal to angle DAC.
- AB is parallel to CD, so angle BAC and angle ACD are supplementary or form same side interior angles
- Angle ADC and angle BAD are alternate interior angles and hence are equal.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BAD = Angle DAC (AD bisects angle BAC)
- AB is parallel to CD.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and CD are parallel.
- Line AD intersects lines AB and CD

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is parallel to CD, angle BAC + angle ACD = 180 degrees. Therefore, angle BAC = 180 - 80 = 100 degrees.
- Angle BAD = Angle DAC = 100/2 = 50 degrees
- Since AB is parallel to CD, Angle BAD = Angle ADC = 50 degrees
- Therefore, Angle D = 50 degrees

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
