PROBLEM 320 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The figure shows a quadrilateral ABCD, with S on AC and T on BD. For trapezoid A B C D, S and T are midpoints of the legs. If A B = x + 4, C D = 3 x + 2, and S T = 9, find A B.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD, which appears to be a trapezoid.
- Points A, B, C, D, S, and T are labeled.
- Line segments AB, CD, and ST are labeled with expressions: AB = x + 4, CD = 3x + 2, and ST = 9.
- S lies on AC and T lies on BD.
- The statement says that S and T are the midpoints of legs AC and BD of the trapezoid ABCD.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are explicitly marked.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- S is the midpoint of AC so AS = SC.
- T is the midpoint of BD so BT = TD.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- S lies on AC, and T lies on BD.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- ST is the median of the trapezoid ABCD. Therefore, ST = (AB + CD) / 2.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The expressions for AB, CD, and ST and the midpoint information are all present.
