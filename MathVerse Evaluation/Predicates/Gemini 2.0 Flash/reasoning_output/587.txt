PROBLEM 587 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (-1,0), (0,8), (2,0), (4,0), have inverse functions?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a curve in a 2D plane with x and y axes.
- The curve passes through points (-1,0), (0,8), (2,0), and (4,0).
- We need to determine if the curve has an inverse function.
- A function has an inverse if it passes the horizontal line test (no horizontal line intersects the curve more than once).
- Visually, a horizontal line drawn at y = 2 will intersect the curve more than once. Therefore it doesn't have inverse functions.

STEP 2: PREDICATE GENERATION

Point: Point(A)
Point: Point(B)
Point: Point(C)
Point: Point(D)

PointLiesOnLine: PointLiesOnLine(A,Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine: PointLiesOnLine(B,Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine: PointLiesOnLine(C,Line(x,y))
PointLiesOnLine: PointLiesOnLine(D,Line(x,y))

Equals: Equals(A,Point((-1),0))
Equals: Equals(B,Point(0,8))
Equals: Equals(C,Point(2,0))
Equals: Equals(D,Point(4,0))
