PROBLEM 376 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In this right-angled triangle, one of the acute angles measures 45^\circ, one leg measuring 4\sqrt{3}. Consider the adjacent figure:Solve for the exact value of y.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a right-angled triangle with one angle measuring 45 degrees. One of the legs is labeled as $4\sqrt{3}$, and the other leg is labeled as $y$. The hypotenuse is labeled as $x$.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The triangle is a right-angled triangle, so one angle is 90 degrees. One of the acute angles is given as 45 degrees. Thus, the other acute angle must also be 45 degrees since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. This means the triangle is an isosceles right triangle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Since the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle, the two legs are equal in length. Therefore, $y = 4\sqrt{3}$.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The lines intersect at the vertices of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle, the sides are in the ratio $1:1:\sqrt{2}$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates should capture the fact that it's a right triangle, that one angle is 45 degrees, and the length of one leg.
