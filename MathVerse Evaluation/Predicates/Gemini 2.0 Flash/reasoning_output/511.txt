PROBLEM 511 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The x-intercept of the line is -3 and the y-intercept is 6. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a line and a shaded region.
- The line has x-intercept -3 and y-intercept 6.
- The line is dashed, indicating that the points on the line are not included in the solution.
- The region above the line is shaded, indicating that the y-values in the region are greater than the y-values on the line.

STEP 2: INTERCEPT ANALYSIS
- The line passes through the points (-3, 0) and (0, 6).

STEP 3: LINE EQUATION AND INEQUALITY
- The slope of the line is (6-0)/(0-(-3)) = 6/3 = 2.
- The equation of the line is y = 2x + 6.
- Since the shaded region is above the line and the line is dashed, the inequality is y > 2x + 6.
