PROBLEM 280 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There are two annotated angles of 5y and 60 degrees, and two annotated length x + 4 and 3 x - 6. Find x so that the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a quadrilateral with diagonals intersecting inside. The figure is labeled with angle measures and algebraic expressions for lengths. The angles are 5y, 55, 60 degrees, and lengths are x+4, 3x-6. I will assume the quadrilateral is a parallelogram.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are labeled angles 5y, 55, and 60 degrees. These will be used to find values of x and y.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
For the quadrilateral to be a parallelogram, opposite sides must be equal, and opposite angles should be equal. Also, the angles formed by the diagonals should be considered. Specifically, we should ensure x+4 = 3x -6 for it to be a parallelogram.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The diagonals intersect within the quadrilateral.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
If the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, the opposite sides must be equal, therefore x+4 = 3x - 6.
Also, since the quadrilateral is a parallelogram, alternate interior angles are equal. Therefore, 5y = 55.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The information provided gives enough constraints to solve for x and y if we assume it is a parallelogram. We must make this assumption to make progress. The information can be represented with correct predicates.
