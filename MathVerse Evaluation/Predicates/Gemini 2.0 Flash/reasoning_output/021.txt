PROBLEM 021 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, it is known that angle 1 = angle 2 = angle 3 = 55.0, then the degree of angle 4 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows intersecting lines forming angles.
- The angles are labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Angle 1, angle 2, and angle 3 are given as 55 degrees.
- There are two lines that appear parallel.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 = 55 degrees.
- Angle 2 = 55 degrees.
- Angle 3 = 55 degrees.
- Angle 4 is an unknown angle.
- Angle 2 and angle 3 are vertical angles relative to an implied intersection.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 = Angle 2 = Angle 3 = 55 degrees.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at various points, creating angles.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since Angle 1 and Angle 3 are equal and are in corresponding positions relative to the lines cut by a transversal, the two lines are parallel.
- Angle 4 and Angle 1 are supplementary angles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary relationships have been recorded for the problem.
