PROBLEM 614 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph, which is a piecewise function and passes through the origin, shows John's speed while he is competing in a walking race, the x-axis representing Time and the y-axis representing Speed. Which situation corresponds to the graph?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph with two axes, labeled "Time" and "Speed".
- The graph is a piecewise linear function.
- The graph starts at the origin.
- The graph has two segments, the first segment has a smaller slope than the second segment.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are two segments in the piecewise function with differing slopes, both positive.
- It is implied that the Time axis and Speed axis are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The piecewise function starts at (0,0).
- The second part of the piecewise function has a steeper slope than the first.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The graph is in the first quadrant since Time and Speed are positive.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- John starts walking at time=0 with speed=0.
- John's speed increases with time, and the rate of increase increases at one point.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image contains the necessary information to infer the piecewise function and how John's speed changes with time.
