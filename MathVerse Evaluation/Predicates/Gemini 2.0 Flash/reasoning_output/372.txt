PROBLEM 372 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right angled triangle, the marked angle is \theta, the marked right angled side has a length of 12, and the diagonal side has a length of 8*sqrt{3}. Consider the adjacent figure:

Solve for the unknown \theta . Leave your answer in degrees.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We see a right-angled triangle.
- One angle is marked as theta.
- The length of one side is 12.
- The length of the hypotenuse is 8*sqrt(3).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle in the triangle.
- We are given an angle theta.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no congruent or equal markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides of the triangle intersect at the vertices.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometric ratios to relate theta to the sides of the triangle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all necessary information to describe the triangle and its properties.
