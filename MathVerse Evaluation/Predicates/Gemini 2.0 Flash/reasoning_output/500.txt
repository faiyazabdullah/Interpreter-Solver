================================================================================
Question: There is a quadratic function that opens upwards symmetric with respect to x=2. The vertex of the parabola is at the point (2,-2). Determine the intervals on which the functions are increasing, decreasing, or constant.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shape: A parabola that opens upward.
- Point: Vertex of the parabola at (2,-2).
- Axis of symmetry: Vertical line x=2.
- The parabola passes through points (0,3) and (4,3)

STEP 2: PARABOLA-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The parabola is symmetric with respect to the vertical line x=2.
- The vertex is the minimum point of the parabola.
- The function is decreasing to the left of x=2 and increasing to the right of x=2.
