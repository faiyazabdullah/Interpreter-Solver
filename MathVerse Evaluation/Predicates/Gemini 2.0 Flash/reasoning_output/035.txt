PROBLEM 035 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure: AB parallel DE, angle B = 30.0, angle C = 110.0, the degree of angle D is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have lines AB, BC, CD, and DE.
- We have angles angle B = 30, angle C = 110.
- AB and DE are marked as parallel.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this diagram

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle B is labeled as 30 degrees.
- Angle C is labeled as 110 degrees.
- AB and DE are parallel. We need to find angle D.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- We are given that AB is parallel to DE

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and BC intersect at B.
- Lines BC and CD intersect at C.
- Lines CD and DE intersect at D.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is parallel to DE, we can use the properties of parallel lines and transversals.
- Extend BC to intersect DE at F. Then angle B + angle BFE = 180, so angle BFE = 150.
- Angle CFD = angle BFE = 150.
- Also angle C + angle CDF = 180 + angle X, where angle X is between the lines.
- Construct line CF parallel to AB through C, and another line CG parallel to DE through C.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the shapes, measurements, and relationships.
- We have identified the parallel lines and the transversal.
- We have identified the given angles.
