PROBLEM 169 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, it is known that in Rttriangle ABC, angle C = 90.0, AC = 4.0, tanA = frac {1.0}{2.0}, then the length of BC is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a right triangle ABC, with a right angle at C.
- AC = 4, and tan(A) = 1/2.
- We need to find the length of BC.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle C is a right angle, so measure of angle C = 90.
- AC is perpendicular to BC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal figures are directly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AC and BC intersect at point C.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since we know tan(A) = BC/AC, and AC = 4, then BC = AC * tan(A) = 4 * (1/2) = 2.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the necessary information to solve the problem.
