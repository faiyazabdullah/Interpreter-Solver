Question: Find the surface area of the figure shown. The trapezoid surface has edges of 9cm, 12cm and 5cm. The height is 3 cm.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a composite 3D shape. It can be seen as a combination of a rectangular prism and a trapezoidal prism.
The rectangular prism has dimensions 12cm, 5cm, and 9cm. The trapezoidal prism has bases 12cm and 9cm and a height of 3cm. We need to calculate the surface area of the entire figure.

STEP 2: CALCULATIONS
Area of rectangle 1 (front face) = 12 * 5 = 60 cm^2
Area of rectangle 2 (top) = 9 * 5 = 45 cm^2
Area of rectangle 3 (left side) = 12 * 5 = 60 cm^2
Area of rectangle 4 (back side) = 9 * 5 = 45 cm^2
Area of trapezoid 1 (front) = 0.5 * (12 + 9) * 3 = 0.5 * 21 * 3 = 31.5 cm^2
Area of trapezoid 2 (back) = 0.5 * (12 + 9) * 3 = 0.5 * 21 * 3 = 31.5 cm^2
Area of slant rectangle = 3 * 5 = 15 cm^2
Area of base = 12 * 9 = 108cm^2

Surface area = (12*5) + (9*5) + (12*5) + (9*5) + 2*(0.5*(12+9)*3) + 5*3
Surface Area = 60 + 45 + 60 + 45 + 2*(31.5) + 15 = 225 + 63 + 15 = 303 cm^2

STEP 3: FINAL ANSWER
The surface area of the figure is 303 cm^2
