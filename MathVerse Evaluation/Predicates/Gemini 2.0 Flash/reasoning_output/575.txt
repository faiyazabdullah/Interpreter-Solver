================================================================================
Question: g(x) is shown in the figure, which is a quadratic function opening upward and goes through (-3,0) and (4,0). f(x)=x^2+4x. How many roots do the functions have in common?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parabola, which represents a quadratic function.
- The parabola intersects the x-axis at two points: (-3, 0) and (4, 0). This means the roots of g(x) are -3 and 4.
- The equation of the function f(x) is given as x^2 + 4x.

STEP 2: ANALYTICAL ANALYSIS
- The roots of f(x) can be found by setting the equation equal to zero: x^2 + 4x = 0 => x(x+4) = 0. The roots are x = 0 and x = -4.
- The roots of g(x) are -3 and 4, found from where the parabola intersects the x-axis.
- Comparing the roots of f(x) (0 and -4) and g(x) (-3 and 4), only one root (4) is common to both functions.
