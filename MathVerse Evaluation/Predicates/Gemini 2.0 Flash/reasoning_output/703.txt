PROBLEM 703 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The dimensions of a trapezoidal prism are given in the following diagram (not drawn to scale). A trapezoidal prism consists of two trapezium faces and four rectangular faces. The trapezium face has edges of 10cm, 5cm and 18cm and height of 3cm. The bottom face has edges of 18cm and 8cm.

Find the surface area of the trapezoidal prism.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a trapezoidal prism. The bases are trapezoids with sides 10 cm, 5 cm, 18 cm and height 3 cm. The trapezoid has a height of 3cm. The prism has a length of 8 cm. We need to determine the surface area of this prism.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this figure.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
We assume the height of the trapezoid is perpendicular to the bases of length 10cm and 18cm.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two trapezoidal faces are congruent. The lateral faces are rectangles with dimensions 5cm x 8cm, 10cm x 8cm and 18cm x 8cm.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The faces intersect along their edges.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The surface area is the sum of the areas of the six faces of the prism.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All the necessary information is present.
