PROBLEM 177 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the cross section of a tunnel is a semicircle with a radius of 3.4, and a truck with a width of 3.2 can pass through the tunnel.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shape: The figure shows a semicircle with a rectangle inscribed within it.
- Points: The semicircle has a center (let's call it O) at the midpoint of its base.
- Lines: The base of the semicircle is a line. The rectangle has sides. The radius of the semicircle is a line.
- Measurements: The width of a segment of the base to the left of the rectangle is 3.4. The width of a truck, corresponding to the base of the rectangle, is 3.2.
- Implied constructions: The radius is perpendicular to the vertical sides of the rectangle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: The center of the semicircle is at the midpoint of the base.
- Radius: The radius of the semicircle is 3.4 (given indirectly).
- Chords: The top of the rectangle is a chord of the semicircle.
- Diameter: The base of the semicircle is a diameter.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangle has right angles at its corners.
- The vertical sides of the rectangle are perpendicular to the base of the semicircle.
- If we draw a radius from the center to an upper corner of the rectangle, a right triangle is formed using half the base of the rectangle and the height of the rectangle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Radii of the semicircle are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The rectangle's base lies on the base of the semicircle.
- The top corners of the rectangle touch the semicircle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The height of the rectangle is related to the radius of the semicircle and half the base of the rectangle by the Pythagorean theorem.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates will represent all geometric shapes, measurements and relationships between elements of the semicircle and rectangle. The center of the semicircle, radius length, and width of the rectangle base is captured. This captures enough information for problem-solving.
