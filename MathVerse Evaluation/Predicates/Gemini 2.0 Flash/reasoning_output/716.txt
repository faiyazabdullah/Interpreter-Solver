PROBLEM 716 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Assume that both boxes are identical in size. The box has edges of length 20, 25 and 33. The middle cylinder has radius of 6 and height of 11.
Find the surface area of the solid.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two identical boxes are connected by a cylinder.
- The dimensions of each box are 20, 25 and 33.
- The cylinder has a radius of 6 and a height of 11.
- We need to find the total surface area of the combined solid.

STEP 2: BOX SURFACE AREA ANALYSIS
- Each box has six faces.
- Two faces have dimensions 20x25, two have dimensions 20x33 and two have dimensions 25x33.
- The total surface area of one box = 2(20x25) + 2(20x33) + 2(25x33) = 2(500 + 660 + 825) = 2(1985) = 3970.

STEP 3: CYLINDER SURFACE AREA ANALYSIS
- The cylinder has two circular faces and a curved surface.
- The area of each circular face is πr^2 = π(6^2) = 36π.
- The area of the curved surface is 2πrh = 2π(6)(11) = 132π.
- The total surface area of the cylinder = 2(36π) + 132π = 72π + 132π = 204π.

STEP 4: OVERLAP ANALYSIS
- Each box has a circular hole of radius 6.
- The area of each hole is πr^2 = π(6^2) = 36π.
- Two boxes have two such holes in total. The area of holes equals 2 * 36π = 72π.

STEP 5: COMBINED SURFACE AREA CALCULATION
- Total surface area = 2(Surface area of one box) + (Surface area of cylinder) - (Area of the two holes).
- Total surface area = 2(3970) + 204π - 72π = 7940 + 132π = 7940 + 132 * 3.14159 = 7940 + 414.690 = 8354.69.

STEP 6: FIND MISSING INFORMATION
- There is no missing information

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured
- Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented
- Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed
- Confirm that the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving
