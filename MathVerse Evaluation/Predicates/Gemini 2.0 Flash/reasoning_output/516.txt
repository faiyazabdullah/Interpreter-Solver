PROBLEM 516 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the graph of the exponential function $y=4^{x}$. What can we say about the $y$-value of every point on the graph?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a function $y = 4^x$.
- There are x and y axes.
- The function is plotted as a curved line.
- The y-values are always positive.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- All y-values are greater than 0.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The y-value of every point on the graph is positive.
