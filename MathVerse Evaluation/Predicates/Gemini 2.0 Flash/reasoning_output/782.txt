PROBLEM 782 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In triangle ABC above, AB = AC,point E lies on line AB, point D lies on lien AC, E is the midpoint of line AB, and D is the midpoint of line AC. If AE = x and ED = 4, what is length BC?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: Triangle ABC, Line segments AB, AC, BC, ED
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Measurements: ED = 4
- Special Markings: AB = AC, E is the midpoint of AB, D is the midpoint of AC
- Implied Constructions: None apparent

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable, no circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No right angles are indicated.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB = AC (given), AE = EB (E is midpoint), AD = DC (D is midpoint)

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point E lies on line AB, Point D lies on line AC

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB = AC, triangle ABC is isosceles.
- Since E and D are midpoints, ED is parallel to BC and ED = 1/2 BC (Midsegment Theorem).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates capture the given information (AB=AC, ED=4, E is midpoint of AB, D is midpoint of AC) and the relationship between ED and BC (ED is parallel to BC, ED is half of BC).
