PROBLEM 228 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is a right triangle with hypotenuse length 17. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle.
- The triangle has sides labeled x, y, and 17.
- One of the angles is labeled 60 degrees.
- There is a right angle.
- The hypotenuse has length 17.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The triangle has a right angle.
- One angle is 60 degrees.
- The third angle must be 30 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit markings for equal lengths or angles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect to form a triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The triangle is a right triangle.
- One angle is 60 degrees.
- The hypotenuse is 17.
- We can use trigonometry to find x and y.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The relationships that describe the triangle (right angle, given angle, side length) are all provided.
- We can use cos(60) = y/17 and sin(60) = x/17 to solve.
