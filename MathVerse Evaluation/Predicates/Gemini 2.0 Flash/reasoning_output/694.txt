PROBLEM 694 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Xavier's mother told him to drink 4 glasses of water each day. She gave him a cylindrical glass with radius 4 cm.

If Xavier follows this drinking routine for a week, how many litres of water would he drink altogether?

Round your answer to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cylinder.
- The cylinder has a radius of 4 cm and a height of 11 cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The cylinder has circular bases.
- The radius of the circular base is 4 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The cylinder has two congruent circular bases.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The height connects the centers of the two circular bases.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the cylinder can be calculated using the radius and height.
- We are given the radius and the height.
- Xavier drinks 4 glasses of water a day for a week.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have the radius and height of the cylindrical glass.
- We need to calculate the volume of one glass.
- We need to calculate the total volume of water Xavier drinks in a week.
