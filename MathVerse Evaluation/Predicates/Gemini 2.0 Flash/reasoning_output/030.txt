PROBLEM 030 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, it is known that OA = OB = OC and angle ACB = 30.0, then the size of angle AOB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Points A, B, C, O. Lines OA, OB, OC, AB, BC. Triangle ABC and AOB.
- Measurements: Angle ACB = 30 degrees. OA = OB = OC.
- Markings: Equal length markings on OA, OB, and OC.
- Implied Constructions: Central angle AOB subtends arc AB. Inscribed angle ACB also subtends arc AB.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Assume O is the center of a circle and A, B, C are points on the circle.
- OA, OB, and OC are radii of the circle, and OA = OB = OC.
- Angle ACB is an inscribed angle. Angle AOB is a central angle subtending the same arc AB.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ACB is given as 30 degrees.
- We need to find the measure of angle AOB.
- Central angle AOB = 2 * inscribed angle ACB.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB = OC (given).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines intersect at points A, B, C, O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since OA = OB = OC, points A, B, and C lie on a circle with center O.
- The inscribed angle ACB is 30 degrees, and the central angle AOB subtends the same arc AB.  Therefore, the central angle AOB = 2 * 30 = 60 degrees.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is captured in the predicates to find angle AOB.
