PROBLEM 259 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In a right triangle G E F, the hypotenuse G F is 16 and H F is 12. E H is the altitude of triangle G E F. Find the measure of the altitude drawn to the hypotenuse.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Triangle, lines
- Points: G, E, F, H
- Lines: GE, EF, GF, EH, GH, HF
- Measurements: GF = 16, HF = 12
- Special markings: Right angle at E, right angle at H
- Implied constructions: EH is an altitude of triangle GEF

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle GEF is a right angle.
- Angle EHG is a right angle.
- EH is perpendicular to GF.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent shapes are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines GE and EF intersect at E.
- Lines EH and GF intersect at H.
- Point H lies on line GF.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle GEF is a right triangle.
- EH is the altitude to the hypotenuse GF.
- We can use geometric mean theorems, similar triangles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information is sufficient to set up the necessary relationships.
