PROBLEM 734 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The solid in the figure is constructed by 3 segments, 2 of segments are same cylinder on each side of the solid with radius of 11. The cylinder in the middle has radius of 4. Calculate the volume of the solid. Round your answer to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The solid is composed of three cylindrical segments.
- There are two cylinders on the sides and a smaller cylinder in the middle.
- The dimensions are given as follows: The radius of the side cylinder is 11, length is 8; the radius of the middle cylinder is 4, length is 7.

STEP 2: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The question asks for the volume of the solid.
- The solid consists of 2 identical cylinders and one other cylinder in the middle.

STEP 3: VOLUME CALCULATION
- Volume of each side cylinder is pi * r^2 * h = pi * 11^2 * 8
- Volume of the middle cylinder is pi * r^2 * h = pi * 4^2 * 7
- Total Volume = 2 * pi * 11^2 * 8 + pi * 4^2 * 7
- Total Volume = pi * (2 * 121 * 8 + 16 * 7) = pi * (1936 + 112) = pi * 2048
- Total Volume = 2048 * pi = 6433.98179765
- Total Volume â‰ˆ 6434.0
