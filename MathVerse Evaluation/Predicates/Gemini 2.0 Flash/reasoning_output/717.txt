PROBLEM 717 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Given the following square pyramid. The height of the square pyramid is 6cm. The length of the base is 10cm.
Find the volume of the square pyramid.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a square pyramid.
- The base is a square.
- The height of the pyramid is given as 6 cm.
- The side length of the square base is given as 10 cm.
- There is a dashed line representing the height of the pyramid.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the pyramid is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The sides of the square base are equal in length.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of a pyramid is (1/3) * base area * height.
- The area of the square base is side * side.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The dashed height line intersects the center of the square base.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The height and the side length of the base is provided.
- The shape is a square pyramid.
- The predicates should include that the base is a square and the measurements for height and base side length.
