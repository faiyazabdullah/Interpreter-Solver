PROBLEM 282 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A B \cong D F. C E is perpendicular to A B and D F. C B = 9 x and D E = 2 x + 14. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: circle, lines, right angles.
- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F.
- Lines: AB, DF, CE, horizontal line through the center of the circle.
- Measurements: CB = 9x, DE = 2x + 14.
- Special markings: right angle symbols at C and E, congruent symbol between AB and DF.
- Implied constructions: radii of the circle, perpendicular relationships involving lines and chords.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center of the circle is between C and E.
- AB and DF are chords.
- Horizontal line through the center is a diameter.
- CE is part of a radius, and it is perpendicular to chords AB and DF.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Right angles at C and E indicate perpendicularity.
- Angles ACB and DEC are right angles.
- Diameter bisects the chords AB and DF.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB is congruent to DF.
- CB = 9x and DE = 2x + 14.
- Since AB and DF are congruent, their halves are also congruent.
- Therefore, CB = DE.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and DF are intersected by a horizontal line.
- Points C and E are the intersection points of the perpendiculars and chords.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB and DF are congruent chords, they are equidistant from the center.
- CB = DE, so 9x = 2x + 14.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image provides enough information to find the value of x.
- Key relationships: congruent chords, perpendicular bisectors, equal distances from the center.
