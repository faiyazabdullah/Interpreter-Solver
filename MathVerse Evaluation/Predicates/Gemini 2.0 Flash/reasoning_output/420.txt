PROBLEM 420 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The perimeter is equal to the sum of the four side lengths of the trapezium. Find the length of the missing side of the trapezium shown.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a quadrilateral, specifically a trapezium.
- The lengths of three sides are given as 10 cm, and the height is given as 6 cm.
- We need to find the length of the missing side.
- We have a trapezium and a right-angled triangle on the side.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height forms a right angle with the parallel sides.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- We do not have congruent triangles.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- No specific points of intersection are shown other than the vertices of the shapes.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area can be determined if base is known.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to express the relationship between the sides of the trapezium and the height.

STEP 7: Missing side has length equivalent to the horizontal base of the right-triangle, added to the top side.
