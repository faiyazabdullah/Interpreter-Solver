PROBLEM 634 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The Cosine function is graphed. It passes through (0,1), (90,0), (180,-1), (270,0), and (360,1). It is symmetric about the y-axis. A black vertex labeled on the function at (0,1). Consider the graph of $y=\cos x$. Its first maximum point for $x \geq 0$ is at $\left(0^{\circ}, 1\right)$.

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for $x \geq 0$.

$y=\cos \left(x+45^{\circ}\right)$

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a cosine function.
- The x-axis ranges from approximately -100 to 460 degrees.
- The y-axis ranges from -1 to 1.
- The graph passes through (0,1), (90,0), (180,-1), (270,0), and (360,1).
- The graph has a vertex (maximum) at (0,1). The graph also has a maximum at (360,1).
- The graph has a minimum at (180, -1).

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The graph is symmetric about the y-axis.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Points (0,1), (90,0), (180,-1), (270,0), and (360,1) lie on the curve.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph represents the cosine function.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information is sufficient for understanding the graph of the cosine function and its characteristics.
