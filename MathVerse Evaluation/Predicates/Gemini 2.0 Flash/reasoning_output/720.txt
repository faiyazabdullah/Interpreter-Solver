PROBLEM 720 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two similar cylinders have volumes of 5760\mathrm{cm}^3 and 90\mathrm{cm}^3.


Find the fully simplified ratio of the volume of the larger cylinder to the volume of the smaller cylinder.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There are two cylinders.
- The volume of the larger cylinder is 5760 cm^3.
- The height of the smaller cylinder is 20 cm.
- The volume of the smaller cylinder is 90 cm^3.
- The height of the larger cylinder is c cm.
- The cylinders are similar.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The bases of the cylinders are circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The cylinders are similar.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Not applicable

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The ratio of the volumes is the cube of the scale factor.
- The ratio of the heights is equal to the scale factor.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information needed to solve the problem is captured.
- Key relationships for the solution are represented.
