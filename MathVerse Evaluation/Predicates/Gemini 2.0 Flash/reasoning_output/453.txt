PROBLEM 453 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the circle, which has 4 intersection points with axes, in the graph.

State the coordinates of the centre in the form $(a, b)$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shape: A circle is present in the image.
- Coordinate System: A standard x-y coordinate system is overlaid on the figure.
- Intersection with axes: The circle intersects both x and y axes.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- From the image, the center of the circle appears to be at (0.5, 0).
- The radius of the circle appears to be approximately 1.5 units.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The circle intersects the x-axis at approximately x = -1 and x = 2.
- The circle intersects the y-axis at approximately y = -1.5 and y = 1.5.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The circle's equation can be determined from the center and radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The location of the center of the circle needs to be determined.
