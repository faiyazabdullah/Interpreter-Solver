PROBLEM 584 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Do the following graph, which is a parabola passing (0,2) and it opens upwards, have inverse functions?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a parabola opening upwards.
- The parabola passes through the point (0, 2).
- The vertex of the parabola appears to be at (0, 2).
- There are x and y axes visible.
- The x-axis ranges from approximately -11 to +11.
- The y-axis ranges from approximately -11 to +12.

STEP 2: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The question asks if the parabola has inverse functions.
- A function has an inverse if it is one-to-one (passes the horizontal line test).
- The parabola does not pass the horizontal line test.

STEP 3: GENERATING PREDICATES
- PointLiesOnLine predicates represent that the parabola passes through specific points.
- Opening direction of the parabola is upwards.
- The given point (0,2) and general knowledge of parabolas are sufficient to establish that the horizontal line test will fail, and hence it has no inverse function.

PREDICATES:
PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,2),Shape($))
Shape(Parabola)
