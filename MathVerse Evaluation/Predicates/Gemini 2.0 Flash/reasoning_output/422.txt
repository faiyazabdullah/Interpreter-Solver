PROBLEM 422 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The total area is 6096. How much area is remaining?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a rectangle divided into three smaller rectangles. The total area of the large rectangle is given as 6096. The width of the large rectangle is divided into three parts, labeled 1000, 10, and an unnamed area. The height of the large rectangle is labeled 6. The area of the first two rectangles is labeled 6000 and 60 respectively.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The rectangles imply right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The height of all three small rectangles is equal to 6.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The three rectangles are adjacent to each other and form the large rectangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The total area is the sum of the three rectangles. The area of each rectangle is width times height.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The total area is provided and the individual areas of the two rectangles. Therefore we can calculate the remaining area.
