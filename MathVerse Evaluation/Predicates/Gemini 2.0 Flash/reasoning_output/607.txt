PROBLEM 607 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What does this tell you?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains a graph with two axes: 'call length (minutes)' on the x-axis and 'call cost' on the y-axis.
- A line is drawn on the graph which represents the relationship between call length and call cost.
- Two points are marked on the line at approximately (10, 10) and (20, 19).
- The line appears to intersect the y-axis at approximately (0, 1).

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes appear to be perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The tick marks on each axis appear equally spaced, suggesting uniform scaling.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the y-axis at approximately y=1.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- There is a linear relationship between call length and call cost.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The key information is the two points on the line and the axis labels.

STEP 7: Generate geometric predicates based on your analysis
