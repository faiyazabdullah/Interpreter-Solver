PROBLEM 090 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, it is known that in circle O, angle AOB = 50.0, then the degree of the angle of circumference angle ACB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center O.
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.
- Lines OA, OB, OC are radii.
- Line AB and BC are chords.
- Angle AOB is a central angle with a measure of 50 degrees.
- Angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle O is present.
- Points A, B, and C lie on the circle.
- OA, OB, OC are radii. Thus, OA = OB = OC.
- AB and BC are chords.
- Angle AOB is a central angle subtending arc AB.
- Angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AOB = 50 degrees.
- Angle ACB is the inscribed angle subtending the same arc as the central angle AOB.
- The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of its intercepted central angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB (radii of the same circle)
- Triangle OAB is an isosceles triangle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point O is the center of the circle.
- A, B, C are points on the circumference of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since OA = OB, Triangle OAB is isosceles with Angle OAB = Angle OBA.
- Angle AOB + Angle OAB + Angle OBA = 180.
- 50 + 2*Angle OAB = 180
- Angle OAB = 65
- Angle ACB = 1/2 * Angle AOB (Inscribed angle theorem)
- Angle ACB = 1/2 * 50 = 25

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information needed to find the measure of angle ACB is present.
- The key relationship is the inscribed angle theorem, which relates the central angle AOB and the inscribed angle ACB subtending the same arc.
