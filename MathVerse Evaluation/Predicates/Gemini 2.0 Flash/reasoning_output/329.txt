PROBLEM 329 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In remote locations, photographers must keep track of their position from their base. One morning a photographer sets out from base, represented by point B, to the edge of an ice shelf at point S on a bearing of 055°. She then walked on a bearing of 145° to point P, which is 916 metres due east of base.

If the photographer were to walk back to her base from point P, what is the total distance she would have travelled? Round your answer to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Triangle, lines, angles
- Points: B, S, P, N
- Lines: Line(NB), Line(BS), Line(SP), Line(BP)
- Angles: Angle(NBS), Angle(BSP), Angle(SPB), Angle(PBN) which is a right angle
- Measurements: BP = 916 m, bearing of S from B is 055°, bearing of P from S is 145°
- Special markings: Right angle at B
- Implied constructions: Perpendicular from N to BP

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle NBS = 55°
- The angle between the north direction at S and SP is 145°
- Since BP is due east of B, Angle PBN = 90°
- Angle SBP = 90 degrees

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The sum of the angles in triangle BSP is 180 degrees
- Angle BSP = 180 - 145 = 35
- Angle SBP + Angle BSP + Angle SPB = 180
- 90 - Angle NBS = 90 - 55 = 35 degrees
- Angle SPB = 180 - 35 - (180-145) = 180 - 35 - 35 = 110

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the lengths of BS and SP to calculate the total distance.
