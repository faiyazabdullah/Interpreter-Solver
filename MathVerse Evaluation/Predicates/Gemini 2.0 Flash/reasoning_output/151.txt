PROBLEM 151 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, a student saw a tree by the lake. He visually observed that the distance between himself and the tree is 20.0, and the reflection of the top of the tree in the water is 5.0 far away from him. The student's height is 1.7, and the height of the tree is ( ).
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We can see a person, a tree, and the reflection of the tree in the water.
- The person's height is given as 1.7.
- The horizontal distance from the person to the reflection point is 5.0.
- The horizontal distance from the person to the tree is 20.0.
- We can assume that the person and the tree are standing vertically, so we have right angles where the person and tree meet the ground/water.
- The line of sight from the person's eyes to the tree's reflection and the line of sight from the person's eyes to the top of the tree form similar triangles.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are right angles where the person stands, and where the tree stands (assuming vertical).
- There are similar triangles formed by the line of sight.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There is similarity between triangles formed.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The reflection point lies on the line connecting the person and the tree horizontally.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The similar triangles are key. The ratio of the person's height to the distance to the reflection point should be the same as the ratio of the tree's height to the distance to the tree.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all necessary information to set up the similar triangle ratios and solve for the height of the tree.

STEP 7: ADDITIONAL NOTES
- Let H be the height of the tree.
- 1.7/5 = H/20
- 5H = 1.7 * 20
- H = 1.7 * 4 = 6.8
