PROBLEM 233 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In isosceles triangle R S T, \angle S R T is 70 degrees. Find m \angle R S T.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows triangle RST.
- Point R, point S, and point T are labeled.
- Angle SRT is labeled as 70 degrees.
- Segments RS and RT have the same marking indicating that they have equal length.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle SRT is 70 degrees.
- Since RS = RT, triangle RST is isosceles, so angles RST and RTS are equal.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- RS = RT (indicated by the matching tick marks).
- Angle RST = Angle RTS.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- R, S, and T are vertices of the triangle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle RST is isosceles.
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.
- Since angles RST and RTS are equal, let x = angle RST = angle RTS.
- Then 70 + x + x = 180, so 2x = 110, and x = 55.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We are asked to find the measure of angle RST.
- The diagram and the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving.
