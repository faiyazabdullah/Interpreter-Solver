PROBLEM 656 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The following cylinder has a height of 49 m and a base radius of 21 m.

Find the surface area.

Give your answer to the nearest two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cylinder.
- The cylinder has a height of 49 and a base radius of 21.

STEP 2: CYLINDER ANALYSIS
- The cylinder has two circular bases and a curved surface.
- The height of the cylinder is 49.
- The radius of the base is 21.

STEP 3: SURFACE AREA CALCULATION
- The surface area of a cylinder is given by the formula: 2πr^2 + 2πrh, where r is the radius and h is the height.
- In this case, r = 21 and h = 49.
- Surface area = 2π(21)^2 + 2π(21)(49)
- Surface area = 2π(441) + 2π(1029)
- Surface area = 882π + 2058π
- Surface area = 2940π
- Surface area ≈ 9236.28
