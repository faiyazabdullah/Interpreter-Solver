PROBLEM 472 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,-5), (0,7), (5,-5), (7,0).

State the centre of the semicircle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a semicircle.
- Points on the semicircle are approximately (-7,0), (-5,-5), (0,-7), (5,-5), and (7,0).
- The x-axis and y-axis are shown.
- The center of the semicircle appears to be at (0,-7).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- We need to find the center of the semicircle.
- Based on the points provided, the semicircle opens downwards.
- The lowest point appears to be (0,-7) which could be the center.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit angles marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The distances from the center to (-7,0) and (7,0) should be equal if (0,-7) is the center.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The semicircle intersects the x-axis at approximately (-7,0) and (7,0).
- The y-axis intersects the semicircle at approximately (0,-7).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The semicircle is symmetric about the y-axis.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the key points and the general shape of the semicircle.
- We need to express that the semicircle is centered at (0,-7).
