PROBLEM 697 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the figure shown. The top and bottom cylinder are the same size with a radius of 8 cm and height of 2 cm. The middle cylinder has a diameter of 3 cm and height of 10 cm.

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure consists of three cylinders stacked on top of each other.
- The top and bottom cylinders are identical.
- The top and bottom cylinders have a radius of 4 cm (diameter 8 cm) and a height of 2 cm.
- The middle cylinder has a radius of 1.5 cm (diameter 3 cm) and a height of 10 cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The top and bottom cylinders have equal radii.
- Diameter of top and bottom cylinders is 8 cm.
- Diameter of middle cylinder is 3 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The cylinders are stacked vertically, implying that their central axes are collinear.
- The flat surfaces of the cylinders are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinders.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The top and bottom cylinders are congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The top and bottom cylinders intersect with the middle cylinder at their circular faces.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The figure's volume can be calculated by summing the volumes of the three cylinders.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary measurements (radii and heights) are given.
- The geometric relationships are defined.
