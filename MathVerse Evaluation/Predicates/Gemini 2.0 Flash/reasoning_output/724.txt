PROBLEM 724 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the cube shown. Its length of side is $x+4$.

Find the polynomial that represents the volume of the cube.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cube.
- The side length of the cube is given as $x+4$.
- The cube has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.
- All edges of the cube have equal length.
- All faces are squares.
- All angles at the vertices are right angles.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- All angles at the vertices are right angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All edges of the cube have the same length.
- All faces of the cube are congruent squares.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The edges intersect at the vertices.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of a cube is the side length cubed.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The side length is $x+4$. The volume is $(x+4)^3$.

PREDICATES:
Cube(1)
LengthOf(SideOf(1),SumOf(x,4))
Equals(LengthOf(SideOf(1)),SumOf(x,4))
Equals(VolumeOf(1),Pow(SumOf(x,4),3))
