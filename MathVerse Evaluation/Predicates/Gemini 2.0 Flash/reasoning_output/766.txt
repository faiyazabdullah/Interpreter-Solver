PROBLEM 766 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, point B lies on side AC. This figure consists of triangles BCD and BAD. If 55 < x < 60, what is one possible value of y ?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes: Triangles (BCD, BAD, ABC, ACD)
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names: Points A, B, C, D. Lines AB, BC, CD, BD, DA, AC
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values: Angle CBD = y°, Angle ABD = x°
- Identify ALL special markings: None
- Look for implied constructions: None
- The figure consists of triangles BCD and BAD. Point B lies on side AC

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this figure.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angles: CBD = y°, ABD = x°
- No explicit perpendicular relationships are shown.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruence or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point B lies on line AC.
- Lines AB and BC make up line AC

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Angle ABC is a straight angle. Therefore, Angle ABC = 180°.
- Angle ABC = Angle ABD + Angle CBD = x + y.
- Therefore, x + y = 180.
- Given that 55 < x < 60.
- We need to find one possible value of y.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- I have identified the geometric shapes, points, lines, angles.
- I have translated all of the givens into the predicate format.
- I have included all relationships between different elements.
