PROBLEM 112 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AO is the height of the cone, the bottom radius of the cone OB = 0.7, the length of AB is 2.5, then the length of AO is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a cone with height AO and base radius OB. We are given that OB = 0.7 and AB = 2.5. AO is perpendicular to OB. The triangle AOB is a right triangle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The base of the cone is a circle centered at O with radius OB.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle AOB is a right angle. Therefore, line segment AO is perpendicular to line segment OB.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruence or equality marks are present.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Lines AO and OB intersect at point O. Point B lies on the circle with center O. Point A is located above point O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since triangle AOB is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the sides AO, OB, and AB. Specifically, $AO^2 + OB^2 = AB^2$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates below include all relevant geometric shapes, measurements, and relationships present in the figure, including the right angle AOB, the lengths OB and AB, and the right triangle AOB.
