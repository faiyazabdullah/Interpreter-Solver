PROBLEM 348 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A helicopter is flying at an altitude of 198 metres, at an angle of depression of 44Â° to its landing pad. What is the distance d between the helicopter and the landing pad?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle.
- Points are defined implicitly by the drawing of the triangle, with the vertices being the helicopter's location, the landing pad, and a point directly above the landing pad.
- There is a labeled angle of 44 degrees.
- A side length of 198m is labeled.
- The hypotenuse of the right triangle is labeled as 'd'.
- The angle between the horizontal line from the helicopter and the altitude line to landing pad is a right angle (90 degrees).
- There is an angle of depression from the helicopter's altitude to the landing pad (44 degrees).

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- One angle is labeled as 44 degrees.
- There is a right angle, meaning it is 90 degrees.
- The angle of depression is 44 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicitly marked congruent angles or lengths.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The sides of the triangle intersect at the vertices.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The triangle is a right triangle.
- We can use trigonometric functions to find the distance 'd'. The sine of the 44-degree angle is equal to the opposite side (198m) divided by the hypotenuse (d).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the given information is included in the predicates.
- The relationships between the sides and angles are well defined.
