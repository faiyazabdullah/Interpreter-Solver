PROBLEM 028 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the right triangle ABC and the equilateral triangle ABD are respectively drawn with the line segment AB as the edge, where angle ACB = 90.0. Connect CD, when the length of CD is the largest, the size of angle CAB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Triangle ABC, Triangle ABD. Line segments AB, AC, BC, CD, AD, BD
- Points: A, B, C, D
- Angles: Angle ACB = 90 degrees. Triangle ABD is equilateral, so all angles are 60 degrees
- Given: Triangle ABC is right. Triangle ABD is equilateral
- Implied: AB is a common side to both triangles
- Goal: To find the value of angle CAB that makes CD largest

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle ACB is a right angle.
- Triangle ABD is equilateral, so Angle DAB = Angle ABD = Angle ADB = 60 degrees

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Triangle ABD is equilateral, so AD = BD = AB.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point C can change positions based on the size of Angle CAB.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is common, and ABD is equilateral, AD = AB and BD = AB.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the shapes, angles, and lengths defined in the image.
