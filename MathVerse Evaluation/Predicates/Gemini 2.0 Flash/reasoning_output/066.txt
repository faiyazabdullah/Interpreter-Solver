PROBLEM 066 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, angle B = 20.0, angle D = 60.0, then the degree of angle BED is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two lines AB and CD that are parallel to each other. There is a point E between these lines, forming angles with B and D. Angle B is given as 20 degrees, and angle D is given as 60 degrees. The goal is to determine the measure of angle BED.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle B is given as 20 degrees.
Angle D is given as 60 degrees.
We need to find the measure of angle BED.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruent or equal shapes are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Points B, E, and D are connected to form angle BED.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Line AB is parallel to Line CD. This means that alternate interior angles are equal, and corresponding angles are equal. By extending BE and DE, we can try to find the measure of angle BED.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We need to represent the parallel lines and the angles B and D to determine the angle BED.
