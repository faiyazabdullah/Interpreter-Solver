PROBLEM 559 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: g is a piecewise function. One segment is from (-5,0) to (-2,9). Another segment is from (-2,9) to (4,-4). What is the range of g?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a piecewise function, labeled as 'g'. The function consists of three segments: one from (-5, 0) to (-2, 9), another from (-2, 9) to (4, -4), and a curved segment connecting these. The y-axis ranges from -5 to 9, and the x-axis ranges from -7 to 7.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The graph does not provide explicit angles or perpendicularity information.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicit congruence or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The function g passes through the points (-5, 0), (-2, 9) and (4,-4).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The graph shows a piecewise function g. The domain appears to be from approximately -5 to approximately 4. The range appears to be from approximately -4 to 9.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The analysis has identified the key points, the piecewise nature of the function, and the approximate domain and range.
