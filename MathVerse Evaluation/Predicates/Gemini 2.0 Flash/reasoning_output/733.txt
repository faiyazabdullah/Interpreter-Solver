PROBLEM 733 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the height of the base is 14cm. The height of the prism is 3 cm. Find the volume of the prism.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The figure consists of two truncated prisms joined at their truncated faces. We can consider it as two frustums of pyramids joined together.
- Measurements:
    - Height of the top frustum = 7 cm
    - Height of the bottom frustum = 7 cm
    - Length of the top base of the top frustum = 3 cm
    - Length of the shared base = 5 cm
    - Length of the bottom base of the top frustum = 14 cm
- Relationships: The two frustums are joined at the base of length 5cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Not applicable as there are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height is perpendicular to the bases.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the top frustum equals the height of the bottom frustum.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The top base of the bottom frustum joins the bottom base of the top frustum.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the whole solid would be the sum of the volumes of the top and bottom frustums.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All dimensions are available.
