PROBLEM 068 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Xuan Xuan and Kai Kai are in the same mathematics study group. In a math activity class, they each used a square piece of paper with a side length of 12.0 to make a pair of jigsaw puzzles, and cooperated to design the work shown in the picture. Help them calculate the sum of the area of the three figures circled in the figure, it is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a square composed of seven smaller shapes, which are the pieces of a tangram. The side length of the square is given as 12.0. The tangram consists of two large right triangles, one medium right triangle, two small right triangles, a square, and a parallelogram. The shapes are arranged such that they perfectly fill the large square. We need to find the combined area of three specific shapes from the diagram, indicated by circles.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
No circles are present in the diagram. However, the question references "three figures circled", implying an area sum needs to be calculated. This refers to the three shapes that can be seen more clearly to be included in the question if the actual image is accessed.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The large shape is a square, which means all its angles are right angles. The shapes that compose the square are also mostly triangles and quadrilaterals, specifically right-angled triangles, a square and a parallelogram. The triangles appear to be right-angled isosceles triangles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two large triangles are congruent. The two small triangles are congruent. The square within the figure is a square. The length of the side of the entire square is 12. This determines all the side lengths within the tangram.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The shapes are positioned so that their sides meet perfectly and form the square.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The area of the square is 12*12 = 144. We want the area of the 3 shapes circled in the image, by the user. Assuming they refer to the two small triangles and the medium sized triangle, the sum of their areas can be easily found if we consider each small triangle to have an area of (1/8)*144 = 18. Therefore the two small triangles contribute 36. The medium triangle has an area of (1/4)*144 = 36. In total the are is 36 + 36 = 72.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
