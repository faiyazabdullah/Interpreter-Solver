PROBLEM 248 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the right triangle with hypotenuse length 74 and two sides length 24 and x, use a Pythagorean Triple to find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle.
- The sides are labeled 24, x, and 74.
- The angle between the sides with lengths 24 and x is a right angle.
- The side with length 74 is the hypotenuse.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The angle between the sides of lengths 24 and x is a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal shapes are indicated.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- No intersections are shown in this simple figure.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The Pythagorean theorem applies since it is a right triangle: 24^2 + x^2 = 74^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information for setting up the problem is present.
