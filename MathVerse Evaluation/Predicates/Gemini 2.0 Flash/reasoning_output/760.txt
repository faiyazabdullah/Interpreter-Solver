PROBLEM 760 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, the circle has center P and radius r. Lines AB and AC are tangent to the circle. If M is the midpoint of segment AC and the measure of angle PMC equals the measure of angle MPC, what is the length, in terms of r, of segment PA?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: circles, triangles, lines, angles
- Points: A, B, C, M, P
- Lines: AB, AC, PB, PC, PM, PA
- Measurements: r (radius)
- Special markings: Right angle symbols at B and C. Measure of angle PMC equals the measure of angle MPC. M is midpoint of segment AC.
- Implied constructions: PB and PC are radii. AB and AC are tangents.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: P
- Points on circle: B, C
- Radii: PB, PC
- Tangents: AB, AC
- Tangent-radius perpendicularity at B and C.
- PB = PC = r

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Right angles at B and C: Angle ABP and Angle ACP are right angles.
- Measure of angle PMC equals the measure of angle MPC.
- PA bisects angle BAC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB = AC (tangents from same point to a circle are equal)
- PB = PC (radii)
- AM = MC (M is midpoint)
- Angle PMC = Angle MPC (given)

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- AB and AC are tangents to the circle, intersecting at A.
- M is the midpoint of AC.
- P is the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Triangle ABP is congruent to triangle ACP by HL congruence.
- AM = MC
- Since angle PMC = angle MPC, triangle PMC is isosceles, with PC = MC.
- Since PC = r and MC = AM, then AM = r.  So AC = AM + MC = r + r = 2r.
- Triangle ABP and ACP are right triangles.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information is present.
- The relationships for the solution are represented.
- No critical geometric properties are missed.
