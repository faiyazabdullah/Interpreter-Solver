PROBLEM 314 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In trapezoid J K L M, J K is parallel to M L. J M = 6, K L = 6, and \angle J M L is 80 degrees. Find m \angle K.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify all geometric shapes: Trapezoid JKLM
- List all points, lines, and their labels/names: Points J, K, L, M; Lines JK, KL, LM, MJ
- Note all visible measurements, angles, and numerical values: JM = 6, KL = 6, angle JML = 80 degrees
- Identify all special markings: JK is parallel to ML
- Look for implied constructions: None

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle JML is given as 80 degrees.
- Since JK is parallel to ML, angles JML and KJM are supplementary to angles KLM and LKJ, respectively. We are trying to find angle K (KLM).

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- JM = KL = 6, meaning the trapezoid is isosceles. Therefore, angle JML = angle KLM = 80 degrees.
- Since JK is parallel to ML, angles KJM and KLM are supplementary, as are angles JML and LKJ.
- Also, angle KJM = angle LKJ because it's an isosceles trapezoid.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines JK and ML do not intersect (they are parallel).
- Lines JM and KL intersect (if extended).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The trapezoid JKLM is an isosceles trapezoid since JM = KL.
- Because it's an isosceles trapezoid, angle JML = angle KLM.
- The angles JML and LKJ are supplementary to angles KJM and KLM, respectively. Since we want to find angle KLM, we need to calculate it using supplementary angles from Parallel line theorem.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified the shape, sides, parallel lines, and angles. We also know that the trapezoid is isosceles, meaning the angles at the bases are equal.
