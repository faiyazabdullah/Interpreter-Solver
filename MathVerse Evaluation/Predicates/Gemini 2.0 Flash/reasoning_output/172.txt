PROBLEM 172 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in the quadrilateral ABCD, E and F are the midpoints of AB and AD respectively. If EF = 2.0, BC = 5.0, CD = 3.0, then tanC is equal to ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a quadrilateral ABCD. Points E and F are on sides AB and AD respectively. We are given that E and F are midpoints of AB and AD respectively.  We are given the lengths of EF, BC, and CD. We need to find tanC.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicit right angles or perpendicular relationships indicated in the diagram.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
E and F are midpoints of AB and AD respectively, so AE = EB and AF = FD.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
E is a point on AB. F is a point on AD.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since E and F are midpoints of AB and AD, EF is a midsegment of triangle ABD. Therefore, EF is parallel to BD, and EF = 1/2 BD. We are given EF = 2, so BD = 2 * EF = 2 * 2 = 4. We are given BC = 5, and CD = 3. We have a triangle BCD with sides BD = 4, BC = 5, CD = 3. Since 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2, triangle BCD is a right triangle with angle BDC being a right angle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The predicates generated below cover the geometric shapes, given measurements, midpoints, and the right triangle relationship identified in triangle BCD. This will be sufficient information for problem solving.
