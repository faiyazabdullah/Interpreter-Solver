PROBLEM 214 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In parallelogram A B C D, AD = 9 and A B = 6. Find m \angle A D C.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a parallelogram ABCD. The lengths of sides AD and AB are given as 9 and 6, respectively. Angle DAB is not explicitly given. Inside the parallelogram, diagonals AC and BD intersect at point F. Angles DAB and ABC are not given, but angles between the diagonals and sides are given: angle DAB is composed of 20 degrees and 32 degrees. Angle ABC is 40.1 degrees. Side DC = AB = 6 and BC = AD = 9. We need to find angle ADC.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle DAB is equal to 20 + 32 = 52 degrees.
Since ABCD is a parallelogram, angle DAB + angle ADC = 180 degrees.
Also, angle ABC + angle BCD = 180 degrees.
Angle ABC is 40.1. Since opposite angles are equal in a parallelogram, angle ADC = angle ABC if we know the angles between diagonals and sides.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
Opposite sides of parallelogram are equal in length.
AD = BC = 9 and AB = DC = 6.
Opposite angles are equal: angle DAB = angle BCD and angle ADC = angle ABC.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Diagonals AC and BD intersect at F.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Angle DAB + Angle ADC = 180
Angle ADC = 180 - Angle DAB
Angle DAB = 20 + 32 = 52
Angle ADC = 180 - 52 = 128

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified the parallelogram, the side lengths, and the angles. We are asked to find angle ADC.
