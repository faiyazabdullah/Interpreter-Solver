PROBLEM 632 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The Cosine function is graphed. It passes through (0,1), (90,0), (180,-1), (270,0), and (360,1). It is symmetric about the y-axis. A black vertex labeled on the function at (0,1). Consider the graph of y=\cos x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(0^\circ ,1\right).

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.
y=\cos \left(x+45^\circ \right)
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of the cosine function, y = cos(x).
- The graph passes through the points (0, 1), (90, 0), (180, -1), (270, 0), and (360, 1).
- The x-axis is labeled with degrees from 0 to 360.
- The y-axis is labeled with values from -1 to 1.
- There is a black dot (vertex) on the graph at (0, 1).
- The graph is symmetric about the y-axis.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The cosine function oscillates between 1 and -1.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The cosine function intersects the x-axis at 90 degrees and 270 degrees.
- The cosine function intersects the y-axis at 1.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The maximum value of the cosine function is 1, which occurs at x = 0 and x = 360 degrees.
- The minimum value of the cosine function is -1, which occurs at x = 180 degrees.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The problem describes the graph of y = cos(x), so this should be included in the predicates.
