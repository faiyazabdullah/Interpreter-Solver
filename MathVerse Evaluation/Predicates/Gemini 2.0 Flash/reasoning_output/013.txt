PROBLEM 013 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel EF, angle BAC = 50.0, then angle ACD = ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two parallel lines AB and EF.
- A point C is connected to line AB and EF by segments.
- Angle BAC is 50 degrees.
- CD is perpendicular to EF.
- The shapes are line segments, angles and implied shapes.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BAC is 50 degrees.
- Angle CDF is a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The line AB is parallel to the line EF.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- AC intersects AB at A
- CD intersects EF at D.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB is parallel to EF, additional angle relationships can be derived.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information is sufficient for solving the problem.
