PROBLEM 345 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Luke sailed for 116 kilometres on a bearing of 231^\circ .

If w is how many kilometres west he has sailed from his starting point, find $w$ to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: The image shows a point of origin, lines representing North, West, and a sailing path, forming a triangle. There's a right angle indicated between the West line and a dashed vertical line. An angle of 231 degrees is shown.
- Points: An origin point, implied points where the lines intersect.
- Lines: Lines representing North, West, and the sailing path. A dashed vertical line.
- Measurements: The sailing path has a length of 116 km. An angle of 231 degrees is given. The length of the westward path is labeled as 'w'.
- Special markings: A right angle symbol is present.
- Implied constructions: A perpendicular from the end of the sailing path to the west line.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- A right angle is marked.
- An angle of 231 degrees is shown.
- We can find the angle between the sailing path and the south line by subtracting 180 from 231: 231 - 180 = 51 degrees.
- The angle between the sailing path and the west line is 90 - 51 = 39 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruent or equal shapes are directly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at the origin.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use trigonometry to find 'w' as w = 116 * sin(51) or w = 116 * cos(39).
- The dashed line and 'w' form a right triangle with the sailing path.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All necessary information for solving the problem is present in the diagram and captured in our analysis.
