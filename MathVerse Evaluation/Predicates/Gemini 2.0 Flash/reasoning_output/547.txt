PROBLEM 547 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: $h$ is a trigonometric function of the form $h(x)=a \cos (b x+c)+d$. Below is the graph of $h(x)$. The function has a maximum point at $(-2 \pi, 3)$ and a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{\pi}{2},-4\right)$. Find a formula for $h(x)$. Give an exact expression.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cosine function.
- Two points on the graph are highlighted: (-2π, 3) and (-π/2, -4).
- The axes are labeled x and y.
- The function has a maximum at (-2π, 3) and a minimum at (-π/2, -4).
- The function is periodic.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Not applicable.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The graph intersects the y-axis.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The function is of the form h(x) = a cos(bx + c) + d.
- The amplitude is (3 - (-4))/2 = 7/2. So, a = 7/2 or a = -7/2.
- The vertical shift is (3 + (-4))/2 = -1/2. So, d = -1/2.
- The period is 2 * (-π/2 - (-2π)) = 2 * (3π/2) = 3π.
- Since the period is 3π, we have 2π/b = 3π, so b = 2/3 or b = -2/3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- I have extracted the necessary information to define the cosine function.
