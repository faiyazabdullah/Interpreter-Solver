PROBLEM 392 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of a quarter circle is $10 \mathrm{~mm}$. Calculate the total perimeter of the following figure, correct to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: Quarter circle, two line segments forming a right angle, square marking a right angle.
- Points: Implicit points at the ends of the line segments and center of the circle arc.
- Lines: Two line segments forming the legs of a right angle.
- Measurements: 10 mm marked on one of the line segments (radius of the quarter circle).
- Angles: One right angle marked with a square.
- Special markings: Right angle symbol.
- Implied constructions: A quarter circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The shape is a quarter circle. The two straight line segments form the radii of this quarter circle.
- The length of each radius is given as 10mm.
- The angle between the two radii is 90 degrees.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- A right angle is formed at the intersection of the two line segments.
- The two line segments are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two line segments, being radii of the same circle, have equal lengths.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two line segments intersect at one end. The point of intersection can be considered the center of the quarter circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The figure is a quarter circle with two radii of equal length forming a right angle. The length of each radius is 10mm.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the given information and geometric relationships required for finding the perimeter are captured.
