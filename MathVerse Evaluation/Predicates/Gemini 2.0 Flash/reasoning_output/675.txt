PROBLEM 675 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Let us find the surface area of the solid given (constructed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder). The radius is 15 cm. The height of cylinder is 22 cm.

Hence, find the total surface area of the shape.

Give our answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: Cylinder, Hemisphere
- Measurements: Height of cylinder = 22 cm, Radius = 15 cm
- Special markings: None

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The hemisphere's radius is equal to the cylinder's radius.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The flat circular base of the hemisphere merges smoothly with the top of the cylinder.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Radii of the cylinder and the hemisphere are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The hemisphere is removed from the cylinder.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Surface area of cylinder = 2 * pi * r * h + 2 * pi * r^2
- Surface area of hemisphere = 2 * pi * r^2
- Total Surface area = Curved Surface area of cylinder + Area of base of cylinder + Curved surface area of hemisphere = 2 * pi * r * h +  pi * r^2 + 2 * pi * r^2 = 2 * pi * r * h + 3 * pi * r^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information required to calculate the surface area is present.
