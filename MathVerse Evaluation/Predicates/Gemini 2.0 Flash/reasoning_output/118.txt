PROBLEM 118 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the expanded figure of the lateral surface of a cone is a semicircle with a radius of 10.0, then the radius of its bottom is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cone and a semicircle.
- The semicircle is the expanded lateral surface of the cone.
- The radius of the semicircle is 10.0.
- We need to find the radius of the bottom circle of the cone.
- The arc length of the semicircle equals the circumference of the base of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Semicircle has a radius of 10.0.
- The circumference of a full circle with radius 10 is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 * pi.
- The arc length of the semicircle is half of that, so 10 * pi.
- Let r be the radius of the circle at the base of the cone.
- Then the circumference of that circle is 2 * pi * r.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No specific angles are marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The arc length of the semicircle is equal to the circumference of the base circle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The semicircle forms the lateral surface of the cone.
- The radius of the base circle needs to be calculated.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Relate arc length of semicircle to circumference of base circle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The radius of the semicircle is given.
- The arc length of the semicircle can be expressed in terms of its radius.
- The circumference of the base circle can be expressed in terms of its radius.
- Equate the two, and we can solve for the radius of the base circle.
