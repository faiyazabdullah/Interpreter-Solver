PROBLEM 390 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A circle with a circumference of $44 \mathrm{~cm}$. Consider the circle below.

What is the radius $r$ of the circle?

Round your answer to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle.
- The circumference of the circle is given as 44 cm.
- We are asked to find the radius of the circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There is one circle in the image.
- The circumference of the circle is 44 cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit angles to analyze in the image.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no congruent or equal shapes to analyze other than the implicit fact that all radii of the circle are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- There are no lines intersecting.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The circumference of a circle is related to its radius by the formula: $C = 2\pi r$.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The problem gives the circumference of the circle, which allows us to compute the radius.
