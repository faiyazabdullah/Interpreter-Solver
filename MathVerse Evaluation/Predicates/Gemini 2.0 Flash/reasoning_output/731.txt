PROBLEM 731 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the width and height of the base are 4cm, 8cm respectively. The height of the prism is 2cm. Find the volume of the prism.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a prism. The base is a kite shape which consists of two triangles. The height of the kite is 8cm and the width is 4cm. The height of the prism is 2cm. There is a right angle symbol within the kite shape.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the figure.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There is a right angle symbol in the kite.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The two triangles forming the kite appear to be congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The height and width lines intersect at the center of the kite.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The volume of the prism can be calculated using the area of the base (kite) and the height of the prism. The area of the kite can be calculated using its diagonals.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
All the required information is available.
