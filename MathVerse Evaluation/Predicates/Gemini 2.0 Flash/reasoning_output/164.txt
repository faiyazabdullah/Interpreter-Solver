PROBLEM 164 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, in triangle ABC, angle C = Rtangle , AB = 5.0, AC = 4.0, then the value of sinA is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a triangle ABC with a right angle at C. The length of side AB is given as 5.0, and the length of side AC is given as 4.0. We are asked to find the value of sinA.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle C is a right angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No congruent or equal relationships are explicitly marked.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The lines AB and AC intersect at A. The lines AC and BC intersect at C. The lines AB and BC intersect at B.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Triangle ABC is a right triangle with hypotenuse AB. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of BC. Also, we know that sinA = BC/AB.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have all the necessary information to represent the given information and solve for sinA.
