PROBLEM 298 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The diameters of \odot J and \odot K are on the same line with points A, B, C, and D. Circle J has a radius of 10 units, \odot K has a radius of 8 units, and B C = 5.4 units. Find J K.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have two circles, \odot J and \odot K.
- Points A, B, C, and D lie on a line.
- Point J is the center of circle \odot J.
- Point K is the center of circle \odot K.
- AB, BC, and CD are line segments.
- Radius of circle J is AJ = 10.
- Radius of circle K is KD = 8.
- BC = 5.4

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle(J) has radius 10.
- Circle(K) has radius 8.
- Points A and B lie on Circle(J).
- Points B and D lie on Circle(K).
- Line(A,B,C,D) intersects both circles.
- J and K are centers of their respective circles.
- JB is a radius of circle J, so JB = 10.
- KC is a radius of circle K, so KC = 8.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No perpendicular or right angles are explicitly shown.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AJ = JB = 10 (radii of circle J)
- KC = KD = 8 (radii of circle K)
- BC = 5.4 (given)

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- B is the intersection point of Line(A,B,C,D) and Circle(J).
- B is the intersection point of Line(A,B,C,D) and Circle(K).
- C is the intersection point of Line(A,B,C,D) and Circle(K).
- A, B, C, D, J, and K all lie on the same line.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- A, B, C, D, J, and K are collinear.
- AJ = JB = 10
- KC = KD = 8
- BC = 5.4
- We want to find JK.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need the following segments: AJ, JB, KC, KD, BC.
