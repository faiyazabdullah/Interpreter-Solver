PROBLEM 412 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: This is part of a piece of jewellery. It is made out of a metal plate base, and gold plated wire (of negligible thickness) runs around the outside.

What is the area covered by the metal plate base?

Give your answer correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two sectors of circles and two smaller circular segments removed from them.
- There are measurements of 6 mm and 3 mm shown as radii.
- There are no explicit perpendicularity or congruence markings.
- The figure is made of a metal plate base with gold-plated wire around the outside.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are two sectors of larger circles with radius 6mm.
- There are two circular segments, each being a sector of a smaller circle with radius 3mm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The sectors appear to be quarter circles.
- There are no explicit angle markings.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radii of the two larger sectors are equal (6mm).
- The radii of the two smaller segments are equal (3mm).
- The two larger sectors seem congruent and the two small sectors seem congruent.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The smaller circular segments seem to be tangent to the arc of the larger sectors.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Area of a sector = (angle/360) * pi * r^2

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to calculate the area of the two sectors with radius 6mm and subtract the area of the two sectors with radius 3mm.
