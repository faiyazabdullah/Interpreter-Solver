PROBLEM 359 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the following diagram. The height of the rectangle in the picture is 63, the angle enclosed by the purple arc is 67° and the angle pointed by the arrow is 39°. Hence, find x, correct to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify geometric shapes: The image shows right triangles and rectangles.
- List points and lines: No specific points are labeled. We have lines forming the sides of rectangles and triangles. The vertical line has a length of 63. There's a variable 'y' representing the total horizontal length. 'w' represents the horizontal length of the smaller rectangle. 'x' represents the horizontal length of the bigger rectangle.
- Note measurements: Height = 63, angle = 67°, angle = 39°.
- Special markings: Right angle symbols are present in the corners of the rectangles.
- Implied constructions: Perpendicular lines are implied due to the rectangle construction.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angles: We have a 67° angle and a 39° angle. The rectangles imply right angles.
- Perpendicularity: The sides of the rectangles are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Equality: The height of both rectangles is the same (63).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Intersection: Lines intersect to form the corners of the rectangles and triangles.
- Points: Points exist at the vertices of the rectangles and triangles, although they are not labelled.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Relationship between angles: The 39° angle and another unmarked angle sum to 90°.
- Trigonometric relationships: Tangent of 67° can be used to relate 63 and 'w'. Tangent of (39+67)° = tan(106) or cot(16)° can be used to relate 63 to 'y'
- Relationship between lengths: y = w + x.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to relate the angles and height to find x. The above relationships should be sufficient.
