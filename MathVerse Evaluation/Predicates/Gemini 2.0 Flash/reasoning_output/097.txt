PROBLEM 097 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB is the chord of circle O, OC perpendicular  AB and it intersects circle O at point C. Connect OA, OB, BC, if angle ABC = 25.0, then the size of angle AOB is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: circle, triangles
- Points: A, B, C, O
- Lines: AB, OC, OA, OB, BC
- Angles: ABC = 25 degrees
- Special markings: OC perpendicular to AB

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Center: O
- Points on the circle: A, B, C
- Radii: OA, OB, OC
- Chord: AB
- Inscribed angle: ABC

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- OC is perpendicular to AB, so the angle between them is 90 degrees.
- Angle ABC is given as 25 degrees.
- Angles OAC and OBC are base angles of isosceles triangles and are equal.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB = OC (radii of the circle)
- Triangle OAB is isosceles (OA = OB)
- Triangle OBC is not necessarily isosceles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- OC intersects AB at a point. Let's call that point D.
- Point C lies on the circle and on line OC.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since OC is perpendicular to AB, it bisects AB. However, we don't need that information.
- We can find angle AOB because it is a central angle corresponding to the arc AB.
- Angle ACB is an inscribed angle subtending arc AB.
- Angle AOB = 2 * Angle ACB. Also, angle ABC = 25.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find angle AOB.
- The predicates must define the circle, the points, the radii, the chord, the perpendicularity, and the angle ABC.
- The inscribed angle relationship between ACB and ABC will be needed.
- Since OC is perpendicular to AB, the angle between them is 90 degrees.
- Since OC is perpendicular to AB, then the arc AC = arc BC
