PROBLEM 512 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line goes through the origin. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a 2D plane with x and y axes. A dashed line passes through the origin. The region to the right of the dashed line is shaded. Two points are marked on the line.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
No explicit congruence or equality marks are present.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The dashed line intersects the origin (0,0).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The shaded region represents the solution set to an inequality. The dashed line represents the boundary of the inequality, and the shading indicates which side of the line satisfies the inequality. The line passes through (0,0) and approximately (1, -3).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The information extracted provides enough information to define the dashed line. The shaded region is on the right side of the dashed line. The dashed line indicates the inequality does not include the line itself.
