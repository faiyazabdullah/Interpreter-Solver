PROBLEM 347 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Sally measures the angle of elevation to the top of a tree from a point $20$m away to be 43^\circ . If the height of the tree is H m, find the value of H.

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a tree and a right triangle.
- A right triangle with one angle and one side length is given.
- The angle of elevation to the top of the tree is 43 degrees.
- The distance from the observer to the base of the tree is 20m.
- The height of the tree is h meters.
- There is a right angle between the ground and the tree.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in this problem.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- One angle is 43 degrees.
- There is a right angle (90 degrees) formed by the tree and the ground.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no congruent or similar triangles presented in the figure.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The right triangle is formed by the line of sight to the top of the tree, the ground, and the height of the tree.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We have a right triangle with one angle and the length of the adjacent side to this angle. We are trying to find the length of the opposite side. We can use the tangent function.
- tan(43) = h/20

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all necessary information and relationships to solve for H.
