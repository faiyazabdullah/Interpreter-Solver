PROBLEM 499 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There are two curves symmetric to the orign and lie in the second and fourth quadrant. Use the vertical line test to determine if this relation is a function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two curves in a coordinate plane. The curves are symmetric with respect to the origin. One curve is in the second quadrant, and the other is in the fourth quadrant. The x and y axes are labeled. The graph appears to have a vertical asymptote at x = 0.

STEP 2: VERTICAL LINE TEST
The vertical line test can be used to determine if this is a function.

STEP 3: Generate predicates based on the analysis
```text
Shape(Curve1)
Shape(Curve2)
Symmetric: Symmetric(Curve1, Curve2)
Quadrants: Curve1 is in the second quadrant
Quadrants: Curve2 is in the fourth quadrant
VerticalAsymptote: x=0
```

PREDICATES:
Shape(Curve1)
Shape(Curve2)
Symmetric(Curve1,Curve2)
