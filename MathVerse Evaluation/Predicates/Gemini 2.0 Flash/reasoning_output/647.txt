PROBLEM 647 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the cone pictured. The perpendicular height is 6 and radius is 3.

(Give your answer correct to 2 decimal places.)
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a cone.
- A circle is at the base of the cone.
- The height of the cone is labeled as 6.
- The radius of the base circle is labeled as 3.
- The slant height of the cone is labeled as l.
- A right angle is shown between the height and the radius.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base is a circle with a radius of 3.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There is a right angle between the height and the radius of the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius is 3. The height is 6.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The height intersects the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the slant height (l).
- The volume of the cone is (1/3) * pi * r^2 * h

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the necessary information to calculate the volume.
- The height (6) and radius (3) are given.
