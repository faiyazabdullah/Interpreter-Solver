PROBLEM 139 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, Xiaoqiang made a small hole imaging device in which the length of the paper tube is 15.0. He prepared a candle with a length of 20.0. To get an image with a height of 4.0, the distance between the candle and the paper tube should be ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: The image shows a candle (AB), a small hole imaging device (represented by a rectangle), and an image of the candle. We can assume that similar triangles are formed due to the pinhole camera principle. Points A and B are the endpoints of the candle, and C represents the length of the paper tube.
- Points: Points A, B, and the end point of the image of the candle.
- Lines: The length of candle AB is 20, the length of paper tube is 15, and height of image is 4.
- Measurements: LengthOf(AB) = 20, LengthOf(paper tube) = 15, LengthOf(image height) = 4
- Implied relationships: Similar triangles are formed due to the pinhole camera effect. The ratio of the candle height to the image height will be equal to the ratio of the distance of candle from the pinhole to the length of the paper tube.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- We assume the candle is vertical and perpendicular to the horizontal plane

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- We note similar triangles due to pinhole camera.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The pinhole acts as the intersection point of the light rays from the candle.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Similar triangles are key to solve the problem.
- The relationship is that the ratio of object height to image height equals the ratio of object distance to image distance.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The relationships are all present to solve the question.
