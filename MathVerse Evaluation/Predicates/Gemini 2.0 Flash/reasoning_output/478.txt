PROBLEM 478 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is an ellipse, for which the domain is from -3 to -1 and the range is from -1 to 3. Determine if this relation is a one-to-one function.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image contains an ellipse.
- The vertices of the ellipse are approximately at (-1,3), (-1,-1), (-3,1) and (-1,3).
- The domain of the ellipse is from -3 to -1.
- The range of the ellipse is from -1 to 3.
- We need to determine if this relation is a function.

STEP 2: ELLIPSE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The ellipse is centered approximately at (-2,1).
- The major axis is along the y-axis.
- The minor axis is along the x-axis.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no marked angles.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- There are no explicit congruence or equality markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The ellipse intersects the x-axis approximately at (-3,0) and (-1,0).
- The ellipse intersects the y-axis approximately at (0,3) and (0,-1).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The shape is an ellipse centered around (-2, 1).
- The horizontal radius is 1.
- The vertical radius is 2.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The domain and range are specified.
- Need to decide if this is a one-to-one function or not. A one-to-one function must pass both the vertical line and horizontal line tests.
