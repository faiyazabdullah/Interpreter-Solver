PROBLEM 593 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: A vertical blue line in the graph. What is the equation of the line?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric Shapes: The image shows a Cartesian coordinate system with x and y axes. There is a blue vertical line.
- Points: The coordinate system spans from -8 to 8 on the x-axis and -8 to 8 on the y-axis.
- Lines: There are two axes, x and y. The blue line is vertical.
- Measurements: No numerical values are provided except the coordinates.
- Special markings: The blue line is along the y-axis.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- No circles are present in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular to each other.
- The blue line is parallel to the y-axis.
- The blue line is perpendicular to the x-axis.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicit congruent or equal markings.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The blue line coincides with the y-axis.
- The equation of the y-axis is x=0.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The equation of the blue line is x=0.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image shows a vertical line along the y-axis. Therefore, the equation of the line is x=0.
