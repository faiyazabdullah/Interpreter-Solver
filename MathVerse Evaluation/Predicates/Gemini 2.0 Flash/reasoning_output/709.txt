PROBLEM 709 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the surface area of the square pyramid. The four marked edges have the same length. The perpendicular height is 6 cm. The side length of base is 10cm. Make sure to include all faces in your calculations.

Round your answer to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a square pyramid.
- The base is a square.
- The four sides are congruent isosceles triangles.
- The perpendicular height of the pyramid is 6 cm.
- The side length of the square base is 10 cm.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the pyramid is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All sides of the square base are equal in length (10 cm).
- The four edges connecting the apex to the base are equal.

STEP 4: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- We need to find the surface area of the square pyramid.
- The surface area will be the area of the square base plus the area of the four triangles.
- To find the area of the triangle, we need the base (10 cm) and the height (slant height).
- The height (6 cm) is given. Use Pythagorean theorem to find slant height.

STEP 5: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have all the required information to calculate the surface area.
