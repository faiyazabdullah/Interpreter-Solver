PROBLEM 630 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The Sine function is graphed. It passes through (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0). It is symmetric about the origin. A black vertex labeled on the function at (90,1). Consider the graph of y=\sin x. Its first maximum point for x\ge 0 is at \left(90^\circ ,1\right).

By considering the transformation that has taken place, state the coordinates of the first maximum point of each of the given functions for x\ge 0.

y=5\sin x
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a graph of a sine function.
- The graph passes through points (0,0), (90,1), (180,0), (270,-1), and (360,0).
- There is a vertex marked on the function at the point (90,1).
- The graph is labeled as y = sin x.
- The x-axis ranges from 0 to 360.
- The y-axis ranges from -1 to 1.
- The x-axis is labeled with degrees, with tick marks at 90, 180, 270, and 360.
- The y-axis is labeled with values, with tick marks at -1 and 1.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The axes appear perpendicular but there is no right angle mark.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The graph is symmetric about the origin.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The graph intersects the x-axis at 0, 180, and 360.
- The graph intersects the y-axis at 0.
- The maximum value of the graph is at x = 90 and y = 1.
- The minimum value of the graph is at x = 270 and y = -1.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph represents the sine function, where y = sin(x).

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The location of the maximum point is provided at (90,1).
