PROBLEM 763 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In the figure above, the four circles have the same center and their radii are 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. They form two shaded rings and two write rings. What is the ratio of the area of the small shaded ring to the area of the large shaded ring?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows four concentric circles, meaning they share the same center.
- The radii of the circles are given as 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The regions between the circles alternate between shaded and white rings. The innermost ring is shaded, the next is white, then shaded, and finally white.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- All four circles share the same center. Let's call it O.
- Let the radii of the circles be r1 = 1, r2 = 2, r3 = 3, and r4 = 4.
- The shaded rings are between radii 1 and 2, and radii 3 and 4.
- The white rings are between radii 2 and 3, and the innermost circle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- There are no specific angles marked. But all radii emanating from the common center will be collinear.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All radii of the same circle are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The circles share a common center, O.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The area of each ring can be determined from the radii of the bounding circles.
- The shaded regions are concentric rings.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The radii of all circles are explicitly given, so areas of rings can be calculated.
