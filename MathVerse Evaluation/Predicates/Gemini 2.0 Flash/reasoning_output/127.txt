PROBLEM 127 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Lulu cuts a circle and a sector piece of paper from the paper (as shown in the picture), and uses them to form a cone model. If the radius of the circle is 1.0. The central angle of the sector is equal to 120.0, then the radius of the sector is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- We have a circle and a sector.
- The radius of the circle is 1.
- The central angle of the sector is 120 degrees.
- The circle is tangent to the arc of the sector.
- We need to find the radius of the sector.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- We have a circle. Radius of the circle is 1.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The sector has a central angle of 120 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The circumference of the circle equals the arc length of the sector.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Circle is above the sector and tangent to it.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The arc length of the sector is equal to the circumference of the circle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The predicates should include the radius of the circle and central angle of the sector.

PREDICATES:
Point(A)
Circle(A)
RadiusOf: RadiusOf(A)
Equals(RadiusOf(A),1.0)
Sector(O,B,C)
Angle(B,O,C)
Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(B,O,C)),120.0)
