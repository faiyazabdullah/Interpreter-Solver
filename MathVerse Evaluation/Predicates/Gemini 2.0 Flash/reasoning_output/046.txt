PROBLEM 046 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, if AB parallel CD, angle A = 70.0, then the degree of angle 1 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows two lines AB and CD, and a transversal line intersecting both.
- Angle A is given as 70 degrees.
- Angle 1 is the angle formed at the intersection of line CD and the transversal.
- AB and CD are marked as parallel.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 1 and the angle adjacent to it form a linear pair, meaning they are supplementary.
- Angle A and the corresponding angle between CD and the transversal are equal since AB || CD.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- AB is parallel to CD

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The lines intersect at the points of the transversal.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since AB || CD, the corresponding angles are equal.
- Angle 1 and the corresponding angle to A are supplementary.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
