PROBLEM 718 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the two similar spheres shown. The smaller sphere has radius $3$ cm while the larger sphere has a radius of 12 cm.


Find the volume of Sphere A, in simplest exact form.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shapes: Two spheres, labeled A and B. Each sphere has a visible circular cross-section.
- Measurements: Sphere A has a radius of 3 cm, Sphere B has a radius of 12 cm.
- Relationships: The spheres are similar.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Sphere A: Radius = 3 cm
- Sphere B: Radius = 12 cm
- The radius is shown as a line segment from the center to a point on the circle (sphere).

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No angles are explicitly shown or marked.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radii are given numerical values.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The radii are shown as originating from the center of each circle/sphere.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The problem states the spheres are similar. This means they have the same shape but different sizes. The radii are proportional.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information is sufficient to calculate the volume of Sphere A.
