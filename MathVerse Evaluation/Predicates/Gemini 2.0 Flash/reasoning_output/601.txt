PROBLEM 601 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The line passes (2,-1), (5,1), (8,3), (11,5). Find the equation of the line in point-slope form .
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a line passing through several points on a grid. The points that the line passes through are (2, -1), (5, 1), (8, 3), and (11, 5). There are no explicitly marked angles or other shapes.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked angles or perpendicular relationships in the image. The gridlines are perpendicular, but no lines from the problem use them explicitly.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
There are no explicitly marked congruent segments or equal angles.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
The line passes through the points (2,-1), (5,1), (8,3), (11,5). These points are intersections of the line with grid points.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The relationship shown is that the line passes through the points (2,-1), (5,1), (8,3), (11,5).
The slope between (2,-1) and (5,1) is (1 - (-1))/(5-2) = 2/3.
The slope between (5,1) and (8,3) is (3-1)/(8-5) = 2/3.
The slope between (8,3) and (11,5) is (5-3)/(11-8) = 2/3.
So the slope of the line is 2/3.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have identified the points and the fact they lie on the line. This should be enough to find the point-slope form of the line.
