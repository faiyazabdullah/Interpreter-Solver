PROBLEM 651 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of the sphere is 8.8 centimeters. Find the volume of the sphere, giving your answer correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sphere.
- The radius of the sphere is given as 8.8 cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius of the sphere is indicated by a line segment from the center to the edge of the sphere.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the sphere can be calculated using the formula V = (4/3) * pi * r^3, where r is the radius.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The radius is given, so the volume can be calculated.
