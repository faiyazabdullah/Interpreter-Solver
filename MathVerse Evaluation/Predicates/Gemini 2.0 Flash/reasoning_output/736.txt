PROBLEM 736 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The length and width of the base of the pyramid in the figure are 3cm and 9cm respectively. Find the volume of the pyramid to one decimal place.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a pyramid with a rectangular base.
- The base has length 9 cm and width 3 cm.
- The height of the pyramid is 14 cm.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the pyramid is perpendicular to the base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The length of the base is 9 cm.
- The width of the base is 3 cm.
- The height of the pyramid is 14 cm.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The height intersects the base at its center.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of a pyramid is given by (1/3)*base area*height

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All the information to calculate the volume is present in the diagram.
