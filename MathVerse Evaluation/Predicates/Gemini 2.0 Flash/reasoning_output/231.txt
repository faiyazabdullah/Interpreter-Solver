PROBLEM 231 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: In \odot X, Z W and Y V are diameters. Find m \angle V X W.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center X.
- Points Z, Y, V, and W lie on the circle.
- Lines ZW and YV are diameters of the circle.
- Angle YXW has a measure of (4x + 15) degrees.
- Angle ZXV has a measure of (2x + 65) degrees.
- Vertical angles are formed at the center X.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle with center X.
- Points Z, Y, V, W lie on the circle.
- ZW and YV are diameters.
- XZ, XY, XV, XW are radii.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle YXW = (4x + 15) degrees
- Angle ZXV = (2x + 65) degrees
- Angle YXV and angle ZXW are supplementary to YXW and ZXV, respectively.
- Angle YXW and angle ZXV are vertical angles so they are equal.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- All radii of the circle are equal: XZ = XY = XV = XW

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines ZW and YV intersect at X, the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Since YV and ZW are diameters, angle YXW and angle ZXV are vertical angles and therefore equal in measure.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The given information about the angles and the properties of vertical angles are sufficient to set up an equation and solve for x.
