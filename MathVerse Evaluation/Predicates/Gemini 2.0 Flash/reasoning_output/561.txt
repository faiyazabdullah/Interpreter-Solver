PROBLEM 561 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Quadratic function g opens downward, and goes through (4,-5), (8,-5) with a vertex (6,-1). Is the discriminant of g positive, zero, or negative?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Shape: Quadratic function graph.
- Points: The graph passes through (4,-5), (8,-5) and has a vertex at (6,-1).
- The function g opens downward.

STEP 2: QUADRATIC FUNCTION ANALYSIS
- Since the quadratic function opens downward, the coefficient of the x^2 term is negative.
- The function passes through (4,-5) and (8,-5). These points have the same y-value so the axis of symmetry must be exactly in between them. The axis of symmetry is x = (4+8)/2 = 6.
- The vertex is at (6,-1), confirming x=6 is the axis of symmetry.
- Since the graph intersects the same y-value at two different x values, it must have two real roots. This means the discriminant is positive.
- g(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h,k) is the vertex. Thus, g(x) = a(x-6)^2 -1. We also know that g(4) = -5, so -5 = a(4-6)^2 - 1, which means -5 = 4a - 1, so 4a = -4, therefore a = -1. Thus, g(x) = -(x-6)^2 - 1. g(x) = -(x^2 - 12x + 36) - 1 = -x^2 + 12x - 36 - 1 = -x^2 + 12x - 37. The discriminant is b^2 - 4ac = 12^2 - 4(-1)(-37) = 144 - 148 = -4. This is negative.
- Since g(4)=-5 and g(8)=-5, the points (4,-5) and (8,-5) lie on the graph of g(x). Since g is a quadratic and the y values are the same for different x values, the axis of symmetry is x = (4+8)/2 = 6. The vertex is at (6,-1).
Since the vertex is (6,-1) and the y values decrease away from x=6, and g(4) = -5, g(8) = -5, this opens downward.

STEP 3: DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS
The discriminant is b^2 - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has two distinct real roots. If the discriminant is zero, the quadratic has exactly one real root. If the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real roots.

Since the y-value of the vertex is -1 (at x=6), the roots will be where y=0. Since the maximum y value of the graph is -1, it will not cross the x-axis. Thus, it has no real roots. The discriminant is thus negative.
