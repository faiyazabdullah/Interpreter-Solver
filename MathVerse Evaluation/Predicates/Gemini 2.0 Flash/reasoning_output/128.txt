PROBLEM 128 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, there is a sector with a central angle of 120.0 and a radius of 6.0. If OA and OB are overlapped to form a cone side, the diameter of the bottom of the cone is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a sector and a cone.
- Points: O, A, B.
- Lines: OA, OB.
- Angle: Angle(A, O, B) = 120 degrees.
- Length: OA = OB = 6.
- OA and OB are overlapped to form the side of the cone.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The base of the cone is a circle.
- The circumference of the circle is the arc length of the sector.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle AOB is 120 degrees.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OA = OB = 6.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- OA and OB overlap when the sector forms a cone.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The radius of the sector is the slant height of the cone.
- The arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.
- Arc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * pi * radius
- Circumference of base = 2 * pi * radius of base

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to define sector OAB with radius 6 and central angle 120.
- We need to relate the radius of the sector to the slant height of the cone.
- We need to equate the arc length of the sector with the circumference of the base of the cone.
