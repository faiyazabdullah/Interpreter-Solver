PROBLEM 316 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two triangles A E B and A D C are similar with a shared vertex A. E B \parallel D C.  A B = x - 2 and B C = 5. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a triangle ADC.
- Inside triangle ADC, there is another triangle AEB.
- Points: A, B, C, D, E
- Lines: AB, BC, AC, AD, DC, AE, EB, DE
- Measurements: AD = 10, AE = 4, BC = 5, AB = x-2
- EB is parallel to DC.
- Triangles AEB and ADC are similar.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- There are no circles in the diagram.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- No perpendicular relationships are explicitly marked.
- Since EB || DC, angle AEB = angle ADC and angle ABE = angle ACD.
- Angle A is common to both triangles AEB and ADC.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Triangles AEB and ADC are similar.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point E lies on AD.
- Point B lies on AC.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Because triangles AEB and ADC are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides are equal:
   AE/AD = AB/AC = EB/DC.
- AC = AB + BC = (x-2) + 5 = x+3
- AE = 4 and AD = 10.
- Therefore, AE/AD = 4/10 = 2/5
- AB/AC = (x-2)/(x+3)
- So, (x-2)/(x+3) = 2/5
- 5(x-2) = 2(x+3)
- 5x - 10 = 2x + 6
- 3x = 16
- x = 16/3

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information has been captured.
