PROBLEM 074 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, AB parallel CD, radial AE intersects CD at point F, if angle 1 = 115.0, then the degree of angle 2 is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows two lines AB and CD which are parallel. Line AE intersects CD at point F. Angle 1 is formed by lines AB and AE, and its measure is 115 degrees. Angle 2 is formed by lines AE and CD. The line containing CD is labeled CE.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle 1 is labeled as 115 degrees. Angle 2 is to be determined. Since AB is parallel to CD, angles 1 and AFE are supplementary. Angle 2 and AFE form a linear pair.

STEP 3: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
Since AB is parallel to CD, we have angle 1 + angle AFE = 180 degrees. Therefore, angle AFE = 180 - 115 = 65 degrees. Since angle AFE and angle 2 are supplementary, angle 2 = 180 - 65 = 115 degrees. Also, angle 1 = angle 2, since they are corresponding angles.

STEP 4: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The information included captures the given geometric relationships and measurements, which will be sufficient to determine the measure of angle 2.
