PROBLEM 471 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), (7,0).

Find the equation of this semicircle.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a semicircle in a coordinate plane.
- The semicircle passes through the points (-7, 0), (-5, 5), (0, 7), (5, 5), and (7, 0).
- The x-axis and y-axis are labeled. The x-axis ranges from -10 to 10, and the y-axis ranges from -10 to 10.
- The center of the semicircle appears to be at (0, 0), based on the symmetrical distribution of the points and the radius.
- The radius of the semicircle is approximately 7.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The geometric shape is a semicircle. The entire circle would have a center (0, 0).
- Radius of the semi circle appears to be 7.
- The points (-7,0), (-5,5), (0,7), (5,5), and (7,0) all lie on the semicircle.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The distances from (0,0) to (7,0) and from (0,0) to (0,7) and from (0,0) to (-7,0) are equal and are the radius of the circle.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The points of intersection with x-axis are (-7, 0) and (7,0).
- The semi-circle passes through (0, 7), i.e., intersect the y-axis at (0, 7).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
-  The semicircle is centered at the origin and has a radius of 7.
- Since the figure is a semicircle with radius 7 and centered at (0,0), its equation is x^2 + y^2 = 49, for y >= 0.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- All information required to describe this semicircle is captured.
