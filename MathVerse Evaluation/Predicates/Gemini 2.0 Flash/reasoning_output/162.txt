PROBLEM 162 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, given the angle of circumference angle BAC = 40.0, then the degree of the central angle angle BOC is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle with center O and points A, B, and C on the circumference.
- Angle BAC is an inscribed angle with a measure of 40 degrees.
- Angle BOC is a central angle subtended by the same arc BC.
- Lines OB and OC are radii of the circle.
- Line OA is also a radius of the circle.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- Circle with center O and points A, B, C on the circle.
- OB, OC, and OA are radii.
- Angle BAC is an inscribed angle.
- Angle BOC is a central angle subtended by the arc BC.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle BAC is given as 40 degrees.
- Angle BOC is the central angle corresponding to the inscribed angle BAC.
- The measure of a central angle is twice the measure of its inscribed angle.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- OB = OC = OA (all are radii of the circle)

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point A lies on the circle.
- Point B lies on the circle.
- Point C lies on the circle.
- Point O is the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Central angle BOC subtends the same arc BC as the inscribed angle BAC. Therefore, angle BOC = 2 * angle BAC.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
