PROBLEM 443 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\cos a$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a circle with its center at the origin of a coordinate system. A point P lies on the circle, and its coordinates are given as $P(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29})$. There is an angle 'a' in standard position, with its terminal side intersecting the circle at point P. A horizontal line segment from the origin to the x-axis, and another line segment from the origin to point P, form angle 'a'. The radius of the circle is 1.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The center of the circle is at the origin (0, 0). Point P lies on the circle. The radius of the circle is 1. The line segment from the origin to P is a radius. The x-axis intersects the circle at (1,0). The line segment from origin to (1,0) is also a radius.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
Angle 'a' is formed by the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to point P. There is no indication of perpendicularity.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The line segment from the origin to point P, and the line segment from the origin to (1,0) are radii, therefore equal in length.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
Point P lies on the circle. The coordinates of P are given as $(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29})$. The x-axis intersects the circle at (1,0). The y-axis intersects the circle at (0,1) and (0,-1).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The coordinates of P are given. The radius of the circle is 1. The center of the circle is at the origin. cos(a) is the x-coordinate of point P where the terminal side of the angle a intersects the unit circle.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
The coordinates of point P are provided, and the radius of the circle is 1, centered at the origin. These values are sufficient to solve for cos(a).
