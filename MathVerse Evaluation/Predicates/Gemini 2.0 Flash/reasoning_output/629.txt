PROBLEM 629 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The linear function is graphed. The x-axis represents Time (minutes) and the y-axis represents Water (liters). The slope is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Archimedes drained the water in his tub.
The amount of water left in the tub (in liters) as a function of time (in minutes) is graphed.
How much water was initially in the tub?
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- There is a graph with two axes labeled Time (minutes) and Water (liters).
- A line segment is drawn on the graph.
- The line intersects the x-axis (Time) at the point (5,0).
- The line intersects the y-axis (Water) at the point (0,360).
- The slope of the line is negative.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The x and y axes are perpendicular.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No congruencies are marked.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The line intersects the x-axis at (5,0).
- The line intersects the y-axis at (0,360).

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The graph shows a linear relationship between the amount of water in the tub and time.
- The amount of water decreases as time increases.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The key information is the initial amount of water, which is the y-intercept of the line.
