PROBLEM 171 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the hypotenuse of Rttriangle ABC AB = 10.0, cosA = frac {3.0}{5.0}, then the length of BC is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a right triangle ABC with angle C being 90 degrees.
- The hypotenuse AB has a length of 10.
- The cosine of angle A is given as 3/5.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle C is a right angle, so measure of angle C is 90 degrees.
- Since it's a right triangle, we can use trigonometric ratios.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- We are given that cosA = 3/5.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Lines AB and AC meet at point A.
- Lines AC and BC meet at point C.
- Lines AB and BC meet at point B.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- cosA = Adjacent/Hypotenuse = AC/AB
- Since AB = 10, AC = 10 * cosA = 10 * (3/5) = 6
- Using the Pythagorean theorem: AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2
- 10^2 = 6^2 + BC^2
- 100 = 36 + BC^2
- BC^2 = 64
- BC = 8

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We need to find the length of BC.
- We have AB and cosA, which allows us to calculate AC.
- Using the Pythagorean theorem we can find BC.

STEP 7: FINAL CHECK
