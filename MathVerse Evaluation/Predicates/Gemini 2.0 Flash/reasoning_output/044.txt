PROBLEM 044 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: As shown in the figure, the two street lamps A and B are separated by 30.0. One night, when Xiaogang went straight 25.0 from the bottom of street lamp A to the bottom of street lamp B, he found that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of street lamp B. It is known that Xiaogang's height is 1.5, then the height of the street lamp is ()
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Two street lamps are depicted, labeled A and B.
- Xiaogang is standing between the street lamps.
- The distance between the base of lamp A and Xiaogang is 25.0.
- The total distance between the base of lamp A and the base of lamp B is 30.0.
- Xiaogang's height is 1.5.
- The top of Xiaogang's head aligns with the top of lamp A and the bottom of lamp B, forming a line.
- There are implied right angles where the street lamps meet the ground and where Xiaogang stands.
- The problem creates two similar triangles.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The street lamps form right angles with the ground.
- Xiaogang also forms a right angle with the ground.
- Two similar triangles are formed, one with the height of the street lamp and the distance between street lamps and the other with Xiaogang's height and the remaining distance to lamp B.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- No explicitly marked congruent shapes or equal lengths/angles.
- However, the verticality creates right angles, enabling similarity analysis.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Intersection occurs at Xiaogang's head, and where the street lamps and Xiaogang meet the ground.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Similar triangle relationships are key. The ratio of corresponding sides is constant.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Sufficient information is available to determine the height of street lamp A by setting up similar triangle ratio.
