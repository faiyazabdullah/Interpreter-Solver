PROBLEM 409 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The radius of the figure is $ 8 \mathrm{~cm}$. Find the perimeter of the figure shown, correct to two decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The figure is a sector of a circle.
- The radius of the circle is given as 8 cm.
- The central angle of the sector is given as 40 degrees.
- We need to find the perimeter of the sector. The perimeter consists of two radii and the arc length.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The radius is 8 cm.
- The central angle is 40 degrees.
- We can calculate the arc length using the formula: arc length = (central angle / 360) * 2 * pi * radius.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The central angle is 40 degrees. No perpendicular relationships are explicitly shown.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The two radii are equal in length (8 cm).

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The two radii meet at the center of the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Arc length = (40/360) * 2 * pi * 8 = (1/9) * 16 * pi = (16/9) * pi
- Perimeter = 8 + 8 + (16/9) * pi = 16 + (16/9) * pi

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- We have identified all the necessary information to calculate the perimeter of the sector.
