PROBLEM 296 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: There is an equilateral triangle with two sides 2 x + 11 and 6 x - 9. Find x.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a triangle with all three angles marked with the same arc, indicating that the triangle is equilateral. Two sides of the triangle have lengths labeled as 2x + 11 and 6x - 9.
We want to find the value of x.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
There are no circles in this image.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
The angles are indicated to be equal, but their measures are not provided.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The triangle appears to be equilateral. Therefore, all sides are equal.
Thus, 2x + 11 = 6x - 9.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
No intersections are present

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The triangle is equilateral.
Side lengths 2x + 11 and 6x - 9 are equal.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have all necessary information.

PREDICATES:
Triangle(1)
IsSideOf(Line(1),Triangle(1))
IsSideOf(Line(2),Triangle(1))
Equilateral(Triangle(1))
LengthOf(Line(1),2x+11)
LengthOf(Line(2),6x-9)
Equals(LengthOf(Line(1)),LengthOf(Line(2)))
Equals(2x+11,6x-9)
