PROBLEM 700 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Consider the following rectangular prism with length width and height equal to 12 m, 6 m and 4 m respectively.

Find the surface area of the prism.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a rectangular prism.
- The prism has dimensions 12m, 6m, and 4m.
- There are no other markings or special indicators in the image.

STEP 2: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The rectangular prism has right angles at all corners.

STEP 3: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Opposite faces of the rectangular prism are congruent.

STEP 4: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The edges of the prism intersect at its vertices.

STEP 5: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The prism has 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.

STEP 6: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The dimensions of the prism are sufficient to calculate the surface area.
