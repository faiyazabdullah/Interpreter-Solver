PROBLEM 310 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Two triangles A E B and A D C are similar with a shared vertex A. E B and D C are parallel. Find x if A E = 3, A B = 2, B C = 6, and E D = 2 x - 3.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL geometric shapes (circles, triangles, quadrilaterals, etc.)
  * Two triangles: Triangle(A, E, B) and Triangle(A, D, C)
- List ALL points, lines, and their labels/names
  * Points: A, B, C, D, E
  * Lines: AB, AC, AE, AD, EB, DC
- Note ALL visible measurements, angles, and numerical values
  * AE = 3, AB = 2, BC = 6, ED = 2x - 3
- Identify ALL special markings (right angle symbols, parallel marks, congruent marks, equal marks, etc.)
  * EB and DC are parallel: Parallel(Line(E,B), Line(D,C))
- Look for implied constructions (perpendiculars, bisectors, tangents, chords, radii, etc.)
  * No implied constructions are immediately obvious.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS (If circles are present)
- No circles are present.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Examine ALL angles shown in the diagram, both marked and unmarked
  * Angles: Angle(A, E, B), Angle(E, B, A), Angle(B, A, E), Angle(A, D, C), Angle(D, C, A), Angle(C, A, D)
- Look for right angle indicators or perpendicular relationships
  * No right angles or perpendicular relationships are explicitly marked.
- Check for angle bisectors or special angle relationships
  * No angle bisectors are explicitly marked.
- Identify complementary, supplementary, or vertical angles
  * Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines EB and DC and transversal AD are equal.
  * Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines EB and DC and transversal AC are equal.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- Identify ALL equal lengths, angles, or shapes (look for tick marks, identical measurements)
  * Similar triangles: Triangle(A, E, B) and Triangle(A, D, C) are similar.
- Check for congruent triangles or similar figures
  * Triangle(A, E, B) is similar to Triangle(A, D, C).
- Look for equal radii in circles
  * No circles.
- Identify parallel lines or equal distances
  * EB is parallel to DC.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Determine where lines intersect and at what points
  * Lines AE and AD form line AD
  * Lines AB and AC form line AC
  * Lines EB and DC are parallel.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- Combine observations to identify implicit relationships
  * Since triangles AEB and ADC are similar, their corresponding sides are proportional.
  * AE / AD = AB / AC
  * AD = AE + ED = 3 + (2x - 3) = 2x
  * AC = AB + BC = 2 + 6 = 8

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- Ensure all information needed to solve the problem is captured
  * The relationships between the sides of the similar triangles and the parallel lines are captured.
- Verify that key relationships for the solution are represented
  * The proportionality of sides and the lengths of segments are represented.
- Double-check that no critical geometric properties are missed
  * All necessary information is included.
- Confirm that the predicates will provide sufficient information for problem-solving
  * The predicates provide the necessary relationships.
