PROBLEM 653 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: Find the volume of the following hemisphere. The radius is 6.

Round your answer to three decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
The image shows a hemisphere. A dashed line indicates the radius of the hemisphere, which is 6.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
The hemisphere has a circular base. The radius of the circle is 6.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
There is an implied right angle where the radius meets the base of the hemisphere.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
The radius is equal to 6.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
There is an implied point at the center of the base of the hemisphere.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
The radius of the hemisphere is given as 6. We can use this to calculate the volume.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
We have captured the radius of the hemisphere.
