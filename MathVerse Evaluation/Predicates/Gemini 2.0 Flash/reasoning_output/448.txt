PROBLEM 448 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(\frac{20}{29},-\frac{21}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\tan a$.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- The image shows a circle centered at the origin of a coordinate plane.
- Point P lies on the circle and has coordinates (20/29, -21/29).
- There is a line segment from the origin to point P.
- There is a line segment from the origin to the point (1,0) on the x-axis.
- Angle 'a' is formed between the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to point P.
- The circle appears to have a radius of 1.

STEP 2: CIRCLE-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The circle's center is at (0,0).
- Point P lies on the circle.
- The radius of the circle is 1.
- The line segment from (0,0) to P is a radius.
- The line segment from (0,0) to (1,0) is a radius.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- Angle 'a' is shown in standard position.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radius from the origin to (1,0) is equal in length to the radius from the origin to P.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- Point P lies on the circle.

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The given coordinates of P can be used to find the tangent of angle a.
- The radius of the circle is 1.

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The information provided is sufficient to represent the relationships in the diagram.
