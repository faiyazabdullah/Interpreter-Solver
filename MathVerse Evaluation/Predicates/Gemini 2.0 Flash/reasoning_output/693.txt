PROBLEM 693 - STEP-BY-STEP REASONING
================================================================================
Question: An empty glass jar weighing 250g is in the shape of a cylinder which has a radius (r) of 15 cm and a height (h) of 26 cm.

Calculate its total weight when it is filled with water, correct to 2 decimal places.
================================================================================

STEP 1: COMPREHENSIVE IMAGE ANALYSIS
- Geometric shapes: The image shows a cylinder.
- Measurements: The radius of the cylinder is 15 cm, and the height is 26 cm.
- There are no explicit markings for right angles, parallel lines, congruent shapes, or equal lengths in the diagram, other than the right angle between the radius and the height.

STEP 2: CYLINDER-SPECIFIC ANALYSIS
- The cylinder has a radius of 15 cm and a height of 26 cm.
- Implicitly, there are two circles forming the ends of the cylinder, each with a radius of 15cm.

STEP 3: ANGLE AND PERPENDICULARITY ANALYSIS
- The height of the cylinder is perpendicular to the circular base.

STEP 4: CONGRUENCE AND EQUALITY ANALYSIS
- The radii of the two circular bases are equal.

STEP 5: INTERSECTION AND POSITIONING ANALYSIS
- The height connects the centers of the two circular bases (implicitly).

STEP 6: CONSTRAINT AND RELATIONSHIP SYNTHESIS
- The volume of the cylinder can be calculated using the formula: Volume = Ï€ * r^2 * h

STEP 7: QUESTION-DRIVEN COMPLETENESS CHECK
- The image and given information fully specify the dimensions of the cylinder (radius and height).
