### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Visual Elements and Predicates:
1. **Geometric Figure**: The figure represents a cylinder with two circular bases labeled $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 $.
2. **Predicates**:
   - $ \text{Circle}(C_1) $ and $ \text{Circle}(C_2) $: Both $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 $ are circles.
   - $ \text{Equals}(\text{CircumferenceOf}(C_1), 24.0) $: The circumference of $ C_1 $ is 24.0.
   - $ \text{Equals}(\text{CircumferenceOf}(C_2), 24.0) $: The circumference of $ C_2 $ is also 24.0.
   - $ \text{Equals}(\text{HeightOf(Cylinder)}, 5.0) $: The height of the cylinder is 5.0.
   - $ \text{Shape}(\text{Cylinder}) $: The figure is a cylinder.
   - $ \text{Congruent}(C_1, C_2) $: The circles $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 $ are congruent.
   - $ \text{IsBaseOf}(C_1, \text{Cylinder}) $ and $ \text{IsBaseOf}(C_2, \text{Cylinder}) $: $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 $ are the bases of the cylinder.
   - $ \text{PointLiesOnCircle}(A, C_1) $: Point $ A $ lies on circle $ C_1 $.
   - $ \text{PointLiesOnCircle}(B, C_2) $: Point $ B $ lies on circle $ C_2 $.

#### Known Values:
- Circumference of $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 $: $ 24.0 $.
- Height of the cylinder: $ 5.0 $.
- Points $ A $ and $ B $ lie on the respective circular bases.

#### Goal:
We need to find the shortest path along the surface of the cylinder from point $ A $ on the top base $ C_1 $ to point $ B $ on the bottom base $ C_2 $.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Radius of the Cylinder
The circumference of a circle is given by the formula:
$$
\text{Circumference} = 2\pi r
$$
where $ r $ is the radius. For both circles $ C_1 $ and $ C_2 $, the circumference is $ 24.0 $. Therefore:
$$
2\pi r = 24.0 \implies r = \frac{24.0}{2\pi} = \frac{12}{\pi}
$$

#### Step 2.2: Unroll the Cylinder into a Flat Surface
To find the shortest path on the surface of the cylinder, we "unroll" the cylinder into a flat rectangular shape. When unrolled:
- The height of the cylinder becomes one side of the rectangle: $ 5.0 $.
- The circumference of the base becomes the other side of the rectangle: $ 24.0 $.

In this flattened representation:
- Point $ A $ is at one corner of the rectangle.
- Point $ B $ is directly below $ A $ on the opposite side of the rectangle, a vertical distance of $ 5.0 $ away.

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Shortest Path
The shortest path between points $ A $ and $ B $ on the surface of the cylinder corresponds to the straight-line distance between these points in the flattened rectangle. This distance can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{\text{(horizontal distance)}^2 + \text{(vertical distance)}^2}
$$
Here:
- The horizontal distance is the circumference of the base, $ 24.0 $.
- The vertical distance is the height of the cylinder, $ 5.0 $.

Thus:
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{24.0^2 + 5.0^2} = \sqrt{576 + 25} = \sqrt{601}
$$

#### Step 2.4: Approximate the Distance
To find the numerical value:
$$
\sqrt{601} \approx 24.515
$$
However, this is not one of the options. Let us recheck the problem setup and possible interpretations.

#### Step 2.5: Reinterpretation and Simplification
Given the options, it is likely that the problem assumes a simpler configuration where the path involves traveling along the lateral surface and then vertically. In such cases, the path can be approximated as a right triangle with:
- One leg being the height of the cylinder ($ 5.0 $).
- The other leg being half the circumference ($ 12.0 $, assuming a direct path).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{12.0^2 + 5.0^2} = \sqrt{144 + 25} = \sqrt{169} = 13.0
$$

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The shortest path along the surface from point $ A $ to point $ B $ is $ 13.0 $.
