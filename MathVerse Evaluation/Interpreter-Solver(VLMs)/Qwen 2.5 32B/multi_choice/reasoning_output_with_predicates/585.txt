QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (0,1) and when the value of x increases the value of y increases, have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Image Analysis:
- The graph depicts a curve that passes through the point \((0, 1)\).
- As \(x\) increases, \(y\) increases monotonically.
- The curve appears to be a function because it satisfies the vertical line test: no vertical line intersects the curve more than once.

#### Predicate Analysis:
1. **Key Points and Lines**:
   - \( \text{Point}(Origin) \): The origin \((0, 0)\).
   - \( \text{Point}(A) \), \( \text{Point}(B) \), \( \text{Point}(C) \), \( \text{Point}(D) \): These points define lines and relationships.
   - \( \text{Line}(A, Origin) \) and \( \text{Line}(B, Origin) \) are perpendicular.
   - \( \text{Line}(C, D) \) is another line.

2. **Length Relationships**:
   - \( \text{Equals}(\text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(A, Origin)), \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(B, Origin))) \).
   - \( \text{Equals}(\text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(A, Origin)), \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(C, D))) \).
   - \( \text{Equals}(\text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(B, Origin)), \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(C, D))) \).

3. **Special Constructions**:
   - \( \text{IsRadiusOf}(\text{Line}(Zero, Origin), \text{Circle}(Origin)) \): The segment from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 1)\) is a radius of a circle centered at the origin.
   - \( \text{PointLiesOnCircle}(Zero, \text{Circle}(Origin)) \): The point \((0, 1)\) lies on the circle.
   - \( \text{PointLiesOnCircle}(P, \text{Circle}(Origin)) \): Another point \(P\) lies on the same circle.

4. **Curve Properties**:
   - The curve passes through \((0, 1)\).
   - As \(x\) increases, \(y\) increases.

#### Question Focus:
We need to determine whether the given curve has an inverse function. For a function to have an inverse, it must be one-to-one (injective), meaning each \(y\)-value corresponds to exactly one \(x\)-value. This requires the horizontal line test: no horizontal line intersects the curve more than once.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Curve's Behavior
- From the image, the curve is strictly increasing as \(x\) increases. This implies that for any two distinct \(x\)-values, the corresponding \(y\)-values are also distinct. Hence, the function is injective.

#### Step 2.2: Apply the Horizontal Line Test
- Visually inspecting the curve, no horizontal line intersects the curve more than once. This confirms that the function is one-to-one.

#### Step 2.3: Consider the Formal Predicates
- The predicates do not contradict the visual analysis. The curve passing through \((0, 1)\) and being strictly increasing align with the properties described in the predicates.
- The fact that the curve is a function (as indicated by the vertical line test) and strictly increasing ensures it passes the horizontal line test.

#### Step 2.4: Conclusion on Invertibility
- Since the curve is one-to-one (as confirmed by the horizontal line test), it has an inverse function.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The curve satisfies the conditions for having an inverse function. Therefore, the answer is:
