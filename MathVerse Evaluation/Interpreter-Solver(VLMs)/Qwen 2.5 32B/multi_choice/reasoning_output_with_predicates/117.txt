QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and given predicates, we can extract the following key information:
1. **Sector Information**:
   - Central angle of the sector: \( \text{MeasureOf}(Angle(A, O, B)) = 120^\circ \).
   - Radius of the sector: \( \text{LengthOf}(OA) = 3 \) and \( \text{LengthOf}(OB) = 3 \).
   - The sector is used to form a cone.

2. **Cone Information**:
   - The slant height of the cone is equal to the radius of the sector: \( \text{LengthOf}(OA) = \text{LengthOf}(OB) = 3 \).
   - The base of the cone is a circle with a circumference equal to the arc length of the sector.
   - The height of the cone is what we need to determine.

3. **Arc Length Calculation**:
   - The arc length of the sector is the circumference of the base of the cone.
   - The formula for the arc length of a sector is:
     \[
     \text{Arc Length} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi r
     \]
     where \( \theta = 120^\circ \) and \( r = 3 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Calculate the Arc Length**
The arc length of the sector is:
\[
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi \cdot 3 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 6\pi = 2\pi
\]
This arc length becomes the circumference of the base of the cone.

#### **Step 2.2: Determine the Radius of the Cone's Base**
Let \( r \) be the radius of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base is given by:
\[
2\pi r = 2\pi
\]
Solving for \( r \):
\[
r = 1
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to Find the Height of the Cone**
The slant height of the cone is the radius of the sector, which is 3. Let \( h \) be the height of the cone. By the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, the radius of the base, and the slant height:
\[
\text{Slant Height}^2 = \text{Height}^2 + \text{Radius of Base}^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
3^2 = h^2 + 1^2
\]
\[
9 = h^2 + 1
\]
\[
h^2 = 8
\]
\[
h = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The height of the cone is \( 2\sqrt{2} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\text{Final Answer: B}
\]
