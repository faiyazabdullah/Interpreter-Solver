QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given image and predicates:
1. **Key Elements**:
   - Circle \( O \) with center \( O \).
   - Line \( AB \) is the diameter of the circle.
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) lie on the circle.
   - \( \angle AOD = 136^\circ \).

2. **Relevant Relationships**:
   - Since \( AB \) is the diameter, \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) (by the Inscribed Angle Theorem for a semicircle).
   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle subtended by the same arc (Inscribed Angle Theorem).

3. **Goal**:
   - Determine the measure of \( \angle C \) (which is \( \angle ACB \)).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify Arcs and Central Angles
- The central angle \( \angle AOD = 136^\circ \).
- This central angle subtends arc \( AD \). Therefore, the measure of arc \( AD \) is \( 136^\circ \).

#### Step 2.2: Use the Inscribed Angle Theorem
- The inscribed angle \( \angle ACD \) subtends the same arc \( AD \) as the central angle \( \angle AOD \).
- By the Inscribed Angle Theorem:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Measure of } \angle AOD.
  \]
  Substituting the given value:
  \[
  \angle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times 136^\circ = 68^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Analyze \( \angle ACB \)
- Since \( AB \) is the diameter, \( \angle ACB \) is an inscribed angle subtending the semicircle \( AB \).
- By the Inscribed Angle Theorem for a semicircle:
  \[
  \angle ACB = 90^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.4: Relate \( \angle ACB \) and \( \angle ACD \)
- Note that \( \angle ACB \) is part of the larger context involving the circle and its properties. However, the problem specifically asks for \( \angle C \), which is \( \angle ACB \).

#### Step 2.5: Final Calculation
- From the above analysis, \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \). However, the problem seems to ask for a specific angle related to the arc \( AD \), which is \( \angle ACD = 68^\circ \). Upon re-evaluating the question, it appears the intended angle is the complementary angle to \( \angle ACD \) within the context of the semicircle.

- Since \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle ACD = 68^\circ \), the remaining angle \( \angle C \) (likely referring to the angle subtended by the arc \( CD \)) is:
  \[
  \angle C = 90^\circ - 68^\circ = 22^\circ.
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of \( \angle C \) is \( 22^\circ \).

Final Answer: B
