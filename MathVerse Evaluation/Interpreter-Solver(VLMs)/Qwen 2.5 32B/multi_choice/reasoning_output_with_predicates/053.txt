QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and the given predicates, we can extract the following key information:
1. **Lines \( a \) and \( b \) are parallel**: Parallel(Line(a), Line(b)).
2. **Line \( c \) intersects both lines \( a \) and \( b \)**: IntersectAt(Line(c), Line(a), Point($)) and IntersectAt(Line(c), Line(b), Point($)).
3. **Angle 1 is given**: MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 55.0.
4. **Angle 2 is the angle formed by line \( c \) and line \( b \)**.

The problem asks us to determine the measure of Angle 2.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify the relationship between Angle 1 and Angle 2
- Since lines \( a \) and \( b \) are parallel, and line \( c \) is a transversal, we can use the properties of angles formed by a transversal intersecting parallel lines.
- Specifically, Angle 1 and Angle 2 are **corresponding angles** because they are on the same side of the transversal \( c \) and above their respective parallel lines \( a \) and \( b \).
- By the Corresponding Angles Postulate, corresponding angles are congruent when the lines are parallel.

#### Step 2.2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate
- According to the Corresponding Angles Postulate:
  - If two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent.
- Therefore, Angle 1 = Angle 2.

#### Step 2.3: Substitute the given value
- We are given that MeasureOf(Angle(1)) = 55.0.
- Since Angle 1 = Angle 2, it follows that MeasureOf(Angle(2)) = 55.0.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
From the above deductions, we conclude that the measure of Angle 2 is 55.0 degrees. Therefore, the correct choice is:
