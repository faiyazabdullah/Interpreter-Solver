QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and given predicates, we can extract the following key information:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Points: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \).
   - Lines: \( \text{Line}(A, B) \), \( \text{Line}(A, C) \), \( \text{Line}(B, C) \).

2. **Measurements**:
   - \( \text{LengthOf}(A, C) = 3.0 \).
   - \( \text{LengthOf}(A, B) = 15.0 \).

3. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(\text{Line}(A, C), \text{Line}(B, C)) \).
   - \( \text{Perpendicular}(\text{Line}(A, B), \text{Line}(B, C)) \).
   - \( \text{Triangle}(A, B, C) \).
   - \( \text{RightAngle}(\text{Angle}(A, B, C)) \).

4. **Problem Context**:
   - The figure represents a scenario where a building's shadow is cast on the ground.
   - A benchmark of height 2.0 is placed at point \( A \), and its shadow length \( AC \) is 3.0.
   - The building's shadow length \( AB \) is 15.0.
   - We need to determine the height of the building.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Similar Triangles
The problem involves two right triangles:
1. \( \triangle ABC \): The larger triangle representing the building and its shadow.
2. \( \triangle ACD \): The smaller triangle representing the benchmark and its shadow.

Both triangles share the same angle at \( C \) (the angle of elevation of the sun), and both have right angles at \( A \) and \( D \). Therefore, by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion, \( \triangle ABC \sim \triangle ACD \).

#### Step 2.2: Setting Up Proportions
Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of the building}}{\text{Height of the benchmark}} = \frac{\text{Shadow length of the building}}{\text{Shadow length of the benchmark}}
\]
Let the height of the building be \( h \). Then:
\[
\frac{h}{2.0} = \frac{15.0}{3.0}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Solving the Proportion
Calculate the ratio on the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{15.0}{3.0} = 5
\]
Thus, the proportion becomes:
\[
\frac{h}{2.0} = 5
\]
Solve for \( h \):
\[
h = 5 \times 2.0 = 10.0
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The height of the building is \( 10.0 \) meters. Therefore, the correct choice is:
\[
\text{Final Answer: A}
\]
