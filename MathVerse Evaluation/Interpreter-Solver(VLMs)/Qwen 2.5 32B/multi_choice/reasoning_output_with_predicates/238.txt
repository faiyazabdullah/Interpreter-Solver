====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image and Predicates:
1. **Triangle Structure**:
   - The triangle has one right angle (indicated by the red square).
   - Two acute angles are given: \(45^\circ\) and \(30^\circ\).
   - The hypotenuse of the larger triangle is labeled as 8.
   - Line \(x\) is the altitude (height) from the right angle to the hypotenuse, and it is also the perpendicular bisector of the hypotenuse.

2. **Key Measurements**:
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(45)) = 45^\circ \)
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(30)) = 30^\circ \)
   - \( \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(8)) = 8 \)
   - \( \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(x)) = x \)
   - \( \text{LengthOf}(\text{Line}(y)) = y \)

3. **Special Constructions**:
   - Line \(x\) is the altitude and perpendicular to the hypotenuse.
   - The right angle is split into two smaller triangles by the altitude \(x\).

4. **Goal**:
   - Find the length of \(x\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Type of Triangle
- The triangle has angles \(45^\circ\), \(30^\circ\), and \(90^\circ\). This is a **right triangle** with specific properties.

#### Step 2.2: Use the Right Triangle Properties
- In a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse creates two smaller right triangles that are similar to the original triangle and to each other.
- Let the hypotenuse be divided into two segments by the altitude \(x\): one segment is adjacent to the \(45^\circ\) angle, and the other is adjacent to the \(30^\circ\) angle.

#### Step 2.3: Analyze the Smaller Triangles
- The altitude \(x\) splits the original triangle into two smaller right triangles:
  1. A smaller triangle with angles \(45^\circ\), \(45^\circ\), and \(90^\circ\) (an isosceles right triangle).
  2. Another smaller triangle with angles \(30^\circ\), \(60^\circ\), and \(90^\circ\) (a 30-60-90 triangle).

#### Step 2.4: Use the Properties of the 45-45-90 Triangle
- In the isosceles right triangle (45-45-90):
  - The legs are equal.
  - The relationship between the leg \(a\) and the hypotenuse \(h\) is \( h = a\sqrt{2} \).

#### Step 2.5: Use the Properties of the 30-60-90 Triangle
- In the 30-60-90 triangle:
  - The sides are in the ratio \(1 : \sqrt{3} : 2\).
  - The hypotenuse is twice the length of the shorter leg.

#### Step 2.6: Relate the Hypotenuse to the Altitude
- The altitude \(x\) to the hypotenuse of a right triangle divides the hypotenuse into two segments, say \(p\) and \(q\), such that:
  \[
  x^2 = p \cdot q
  \]
  where \(p + q = 8\) (the total length of the hypotenuse).

#### Step 2.7: Calculate the Segments \(p\) and \(q\)
- Since the altitude \(x\) is also the angle bisector of the right angle, it divides the hypotenuse in the ratio of the adjacent sides.
- The sides adjacent to the \(45^\circ\) and \(30^\circ\) angles are in the ratio \( \tan(45^\circ) : \tan(30^\circ) = 1 : \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{3} : 1 \).
- Therefore, the hypotenuse is divided into segments \(p\) and \(q\) in the ratio \( \sqrt{3} : 1 \).

#### Step 2.8: Solve for \(p\) and \(q\)
- Let \(p = k\sqrt{3}\) and \(q = k\). Then:
  \[
  p + q = k\sqrt{3} + k = 8
  \]
  \[
  k(\sqrt{3} + 1) = 8 \implies k = \frac{8}{\sqrt{3} + 1}
  \]
  Rationalize the denominator:
  \[
  k = \frac{8}{\sqrt{3} + 1} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3} - 1}{\sqrt{3} - 1} = \frac{8(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{3 - 1} = \frac{8(\sqrt{3} - 1)}{2} = 4(\sqrt{3} - 1)
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  p = k\sqrt{3} = 4(\sqrt{3} - 1)\sqrt{3} = 4(3 - \sqrt{3})
  \]
  \[
  q = k = 4(\sqrt{3} - 1)
  \]

#### Step 2.9: Use the Relationship \(x^2 = p \cdot q\)
- Substitute \(p\) and \(q\):
  \[
  x^2 = p \cdot q = 4(3 - \sqrt{3}) \cdot 4(\sqrt{3} - 1)
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  x^2 = 16(3 - \sqrt{3})(\sqrt{3} - 1)
  \]
  Expand the product:
  \[
  (3 - \sqrt{3})(\sqrt{3} - 1) = 3\sqrt{3} - 3 - 3 + \sqrt{3} = 4\sqrt{3} - 6
  \]
  Thus:
  \[
  x^2 = 16(4\sqrt{3} - 6) = 64\sqrt{3} - 96
  \]
  However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that in a 45-45-90 triangle, the altitude (median) to the hypotenuse is half the hypotenuse:
  \[
  x = \frac{8}{\sqrt{2}} = 4\sqrt{2}
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The length of \(x\) is \(4\sqrt{2}\).
