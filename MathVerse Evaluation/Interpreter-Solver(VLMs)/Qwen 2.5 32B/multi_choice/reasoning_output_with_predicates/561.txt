QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a parabola opening downward.
- The parabola passes through the points \((4, -5)\), \((8, -5)\), and has a vertex at \((6, -1)\).

#### From the Predicates:
- The predicates confirm that the points \((4, -5)\), \((8, -5)\), and \((6, -1)\) lie on the line \(y = g(x)\).
- The vertex form of a quadratic function is given by:
  \[
  g(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k
  \]
  where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola. Here, the vertex is \((6, -1)\), so:
  \[
  g(x) = a(x - 6)^2 - 1
  \]

#### Key Observations:
- The parabola opens downward, indicating that the coefficient \(a\) is negative.
- The points \((4, -5)\) and \((8, -5)\) are symmetric about the vertex \((6, -1)\), which is consistent with the properties of a parabola.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Coefficient \(a\)
Using the point \((4, -5)\) in the vertex form \(g(x) = a(x - 6)^2 - 1\):
\[
-5 = a(4 - 6)^2 - 1
\]
\[
-5 = a(-2)^2 - 1
\]
\[
-5 = 4a - 1
\]
\[
-4 = 4a
\]
\[
a = -1
\]
Thus, the quadratic function is:
\[
g(x) = -(x - 6)^2 - 1
\]

#### Step 2.2: Expand the Quadratic Function
Expanding \(g(x) = -(x - 6)^2 - 1\):
\[
g(x) = -(x^2 - 12x + 36) - 1
\]
\[
g(x) = -x^2 + 12x - 36 - 1
\]
\[
g(x) = -x^2 + 12x - 37
\]

#### Step 2.3: Analyze the Discriminant
The general form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For \(g(x) = -x^2 + 12x - 37\):
- \(a = -1\)
- \(b = 12\)
- \(c = -37\)

The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation is given by:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\Delta = 12^2 - 4(-1)(-37)
\]
\[
\Delta = 144 - 4(1)(37)
\]
\[
\Delta = 144 - 148
\]
\[
\Delta = -4
\]

#### Step 2.4: Interpret the Discriminant
- If \(\Delta > 0\), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.
- If \(\Delta = 0\), the quadratic equation has one real root (a repeated root).
- If \(\Delta < 0\), the quadratic equation has no real roots.

Here, \(\Delta = -4\), which is negative. Therefore, the quadratic function \(g(x)\) has no real roots.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The discriminant of the quadratic function \(g(x)\) is negative. Therefore, the correct choice is:
