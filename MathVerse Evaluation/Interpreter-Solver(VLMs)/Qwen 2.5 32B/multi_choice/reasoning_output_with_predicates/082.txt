### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the problem and the given predicates, we extract the following key information:

1. **Lines and Parallelism**:
   - Line \( l \) is parallel to Line \( m \).
   - Line \( m \) is parallel to Line \( n \).
   - Therefore, Line \( l \parallel m \parallel n \).

2. **Points and Lines**:
   - Point \( B \) lies on Line \( n \).
   - Point \( C \) lies on Line \( m \).
   - Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is formed with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

3. **Angles**:
   - The measure of \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \).
   - The angle between \( BC \) and Line \( n \) is \( 25^\circ \). This implies \( \angle BCn = 25^\circ \).

4. **Objective**:
   - We need to find the measure of \( \angle A \), denoted as \( \alpha \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Parallel Lines and Transversals
- Since \( l \parallel m \parallel n \), any transversal intersecting these lines will create corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and other related angle properties.
- Consider the transversal \( BC \):
  - \( \angle BCn = 25^\circ \) is given.
  - Because \( m \parallel n \), the angle between \( BC \) and Line \( m \) (denoted as \( \angle BCm \)) is also \( 25^\circ \) due to the property of alternate interior angles.

#### Step 2.2: Determine \( \angle ACm \)
- Since \( \angle ACB = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle BCm = 25^\circ \), we can use the fact that \( \angle ACm \) is part of the larger angle \( \angle ACB \).
- The angle \( \angle ACm \) is the difference between \( \angle ACB \) and \( \angle BCm \):
  \[
  \angle ACm = \angle ACB - \angle BCm = 60^\circ - 25^\circ = 35^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Use the Property of Corresponding Angles
- Since \( l \parallel m \), the angle \( \angle A \) (denoted as \( \alpha \)) is equal to \( \angle ACm \) because they are corresponding angles formed by the transversal \( AB \) intersecting the parallel lines \( l \) and \( m \).
- Therefore:
  \[
  \alpha = \angle ACm = 35^\circ.
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of \( \angle A \) is \( 35^\circ \). Thus, the correct choice is:
