QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### From the Image:
1. The figure is a regular hexagon labeled \( U, V, W, X, Y, Z \).
2. The lines \( WY \) and \( XU \) are marked as perpendicular.
3. The sides of the hexagon are labeled with lengths of 12 cm.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Hexagon(U,V,W,X,Y,Z)**: The figure is a hexagon with vertices \( U, V, W, X, Y, Z \).
2. **Regular(Hexagon(U,V,W,X,Y,Z))**: The hexagon is regular, meaning all sides are equal, and all internal angles are \( 120^\circ \).
3. **LengthOf(Line(U,V), 12)**, ..., **LengthOf(Line(Z,U), 12)**: Each side of the hexagon has a length of 12 cm.
4. **Perpendicular(Line(W,Y), Line(X,U))**: The lines \( WY \) and \( XU \) are perpendicular.
5. **IsSideOf(Line(U,V), Hexagon(U,V,W,X,Y,Z))**, etc.: Each line segment between adjacent vertices is a side of the hexagon.

#### Key Observations:
- Since the hexagon is regular, it can be inscribed in a circle, and its geometry is highly symmetric.
- The side length of the hexagon is given as 12 cm.
- The problem asks us to find the length of \( WY \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Geometry of a Regular Hexagon
A regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles by drawing lines from the center to each vertex. Each side of the hexagon is equal to the radius of the circumscribed circle. Here:
- Side length of the hexagon = 12 cm.
- Therefore, the radius \( R \) of the circumscribed circle is also 12 cm.

#### Step 2.2: Identifying Key Points and Lines
- The line \( WY \) connects two non-adjacent vertices of the hexagon.
- The line \( XU \) also connects two non-adjacent vertices.
- Since \( WY \perp XU \), these lines intersect at the center of the hexagon, which we will call \( O \).

#### Step 2.3: Analyzing the Perpendicularity and Symmetry
1. In a regular hexagon, the diagonals that connect opposite vertices (e.g., \( WY \) and \( XU \)) pass through the center \( O \) and are perpendicular to each other.
2. The length of the diagonal \( WY \) can be calculated using the properties of the hexagon. Specifically, the diagonal \( WY \) spans across two sides of the hexagon and forms an equilateral triangle with two radii of the circumscribed circle.

#### Step 2.4: Calculating the Length of \( WY \)
- Consider the triangle \( OWY \), where \( O \) is the center of the hexagon, and \( W \) and \( Y \) are vertices.
- The distance \( OW \) and \( OY \) are both radii of the circumscribed circle, so \( OW = OY = 12 \) cm.
- The angle \( \angle WOY \) is \( 120^\circ \) because it spans two sides of the hexagon.
- Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle OWY \):
  \[
  WY^2 = OW^2 + OY^2 - 2 \cdot OW \cdot OY \cdot \cos(120^\circ)
  \]
  - Here, \( OW = OY = 12 \) cm and \( \cos(120^\circ) = -\frac{1}{2} \).
  - Substituting these values:
    \[
    WY^2 = 12^2 + 12^2 - 2 \cdot 12 \cdot 12 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)
    \]
    \[
    WY^2 = 144 + 144 + 144 = 432
    \]
    \[
    WY = \sqrt{432} = 12\sqrt{3}
    \]

#### Step 2.5: Verifying the Result
- The calculation aligns with the geometric properties of a regular hexagon, where the length of a diagonal spanning two sides is indeed \( 12\sqrt{3} \) cm.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The length of \( WY \) is \( 12\sqrt{3} \) cm. Matching this with the given choices:
- A: 12
- B: \( 6\sqrt{6} \)
- C: \( 12\sqrt{3} \)
- D: 36

The correct answer is \( C \).
