QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The curve shown is a parabola that opens upwards.
2. The parabola passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).
3. The axes are labeled \(x\) and \(y\), and the origin is at \((0, 0)\).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0),Line(x))**: The point \((0, 0)\) lies on the \(x\)-axis.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0),Line(y))**: The point \((0, 0)\) lies on the \(y\)-axis.
3. **Perpendicular(Line(x),Line(y))**: The \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis are perpendicular.
4. **Shape(Parabola)**: The given shape is a parabola.
5. **Equals(Origin,(0,0))**: The origin is defined as the point \((0, 0)\).
6. **PointLiesOnShape(Origin,Parabola)**: The origin \((0, 0)\) lies on the parabola.

#### Key Observations:
- The parabola is symmetric about its axis of symmetry, which is the \(y\)-axis (since it opens upwards and is centered at the origin).
- The parabola passes through the origin, meaning the equation of the parabola must satisfy \(f(0) = 0\).
- Quadratic functions have the general form \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\). Since the parabola passes through the origin, substituting \((0, 0)\) into the equation gives \(c = 0\). Thus, the equation simplifies to \(y = ax^2 + bx\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the General Form of the Parabola
- The parabola opens upwards, so the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive (\(a > 0\)).
- Since the parabola passes through the origin, the constant term \(c\) is zero. Therefore, the equation of the parabola can be written as:
  \[
  y = ax^2 + bx
  \]
  where \(a > 0\) and \(b\) is a real number.

#### Step 2.2: Analyze Symmetry
- The parabola is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis. For a function to be symmetric about the \(y\)-axis, it must be an **even function**. An even function satisfies the property:
  \[
  f(-x) = f(x)
  \]
- Substitute \(-x\) into the equation \(y = ax^2 + bx\):
  \[
  f(-x) = a(-x)^2 + b(-x) = ax^2 - bx
  \]
  For the function to be even, \(f(-x)\) must equal \(f(x)\):
  \[
  ax^2 - bx = ax^2 + bx
  \]
  This equality holds only if \(b = 0\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
  \[
  y = ax^2
  \]
  which is a pure quadratic term with no linear term.

#### Step 2.3: Determine the Power of the Function
- The simplified equation \(y = ax^2\) shows that the highest power of \(x\) is 2, which is an **even power**.
- Since the function is an even function (symmetric about the \(y\)-axis) and has an even power, the graphed function has an even power.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The graphed function is \(y = ax^2\), which is a quadratic function with an even power. Therefore, the correct answer is:
