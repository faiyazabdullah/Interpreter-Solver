QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given image and predicates:
- **Points**: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are points.
- **Lines**: \( AB \) and \( CD \) are lines.
- **Parallelism**: \( AB \parallel CD \).
- **Angles**: 
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(2)) = 135^\circ \).
  - \( \text{Angle}(1) \) is the angle we need to determine.

From the image:
- Angle 2 is labeled adjacent to the transversal intersecting the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- Angle 1 is formed by the transversal and line \( AB \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify the relationship between angles formed by a transversal and parallel lines
- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles (also known as same-side interior angles) are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 2.2: Analyze the given angle
- The given angle \( \text{Angle}(2) \) is marked as \( 135^\circ \). This angle is an interior angle on the same side of the transversal as \( \text{Angle}(1) \).

#### Step 2.3: Apply the property of consecutive interior angles
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the angles \( \text{Angle}(1) \) and \( \text{Angle}(2) \) are consecutive interior angles. By the property of consecutive interior angles:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(2)) = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2.4: Substitute the given value
- We know \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(2)) = 135^\circ \). Substituting this into the equation:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1)) + 135^\circ = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2.5: Solve for \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1)) \)
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1)) \):
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1)) = 180^\circ - 135^\circ = 45^\circ
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of \( \text{Angle}(1) \) is \( 45^\circ \). Therefore, the correct choice is:
