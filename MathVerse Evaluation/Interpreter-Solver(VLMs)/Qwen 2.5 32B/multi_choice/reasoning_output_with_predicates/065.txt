QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and given predicates:
1. **Lines**: Line(a) and Line(b) are parallel (Parallel(Line(a), Line(b))).
2. **Angles**:
   - Angle(4) = 30° (MeasureOf(Angle(4)) = 30.0).
   - Angle(1) = Angle(2) (Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(2)))).
3. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since Line(a) is parallel to Line(b), corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific properties.
   - We need to determine the measure of Angle(3).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Analyze Angle(4)
- From the image, Angle(4) is given as 30°. This angle is adjacent to Angle(3), and they form a linear pair.
- By the Linear Pair Postulate, the sum of the measures of a linear pair is 180°.
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf(Angle(3))} + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(4))} = 180°
  $$
  Substituting the value of Angle(4):
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf(Angle(3))} + 30° = 180°
  $$
  Solving for Angle(3):
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf(Angle(3))} = 180° - 30° = 150°
  $$

#### Step 2.2: Verify Consistency with Parallel Lines
- Since Line(a) is parallel to Line(b), and Line(c) is a transversal, Angle(1) and Angle(2) are corresponding angles. The problem states that Angle(1) = Angle(2), which is consistent with the properties of parallel lines.
- Additionally, Angle(3) is the consecutive interior angle to Angle(1) (or Angle(2)), but we do not need this information to solve for Angle(3) directly since we already used the linear pair relationship.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- From the above deductions, the measure of Angle(3) is 150°.
- Comparing this with the given choices:
  - A: 120°
  - B: 130°
  - C: 145°
  - D: 150°

The correct choice is D.

### Final Answer:
