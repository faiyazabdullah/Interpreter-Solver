QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the image:
1. **Predicate Analysis:**
   - `Rectangle(1)`: Indicates the figure involves a rectangle.
   - `MeasureOf(Angle(1), 140.0)`: Angle 1 measures 140°.
   - `Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), $), 180.0)` and `Equals($, 40.0)`: This indicates that the sum of Angle 1 and another angle equals 180°. Since Angle 1 is 140°, the complementary angle must be \(180° - 140° = 40°\).
   - `Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), Mul(2, $)), 180.0)` and `Equals($, 40.0)`: This indicates that Angle 2 plus twice the measure of another angle (40°) equals 180°.

2. **Visual Analysis:**
   - The image shows a folded rectangle. The fold creates two congruent triangles, and the angles involved are related by symmetry and the properties of straight lines.
   - Angle 1 is marked as 140°, and its adjacent angle on the straight line is therefore 40° (since they sum to 180°).

3. **Key Relationships:**
   - The folding process implies that the angles around the fold are symmetric and related to the straight-line property.
   - Angle 2 is formed by the fold and is related to the 40° angle created by the straight-line property.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Determine the Complementary Angle
From the predicate `MeasureOf(Angle(1), 140.0)` and the fact that angles on a straight line sum to 180°:
\[
\text{Measure of the complementary angle} = 180° - 140° = 40°.
\]
Thus, the angle adjacent to Angle 1 is 40°.

#### Step 2.2: Relate Angle 2 to the Folded Geometry
The folding process creates two congruent triangles. The angle at the fold (Angle 2) is related to the 40° angle by the equation:
\[
\text{Measure of Angle 2} + 2 \times 40° = 180°.
\]
This comes from the predicate `Equals(SumOf(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), Mul(2, $)), 180.0)` where `$ = 40°`.

#### Step 2.3: Solve for Angle 2
Substitute the value of the 40° angle into the equation:
\[
\text{Measure of Angle 2} + 2 \times 40° = 180°.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\text{Measure of Angle 2} + 80° = 180°.
\]
\[
\text{Measure of Angle 2} = 180° - 80° = 100°.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of Angle 2 is 100°. Therefore, the correct choice is:
\[
\text{Final Answer: A}
\]

Final Answer: A
