QUESTION:
Do the following graph, which is a curve passes (-1,0), (0,8), (2,0), (4,0), have inverse functions?

CHOICES:
A:Yes
B:No

====================================================================================================
QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph is a curve passing through the points \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 8)\), \((2, 0)\), and \((4, 0)\).
- The curve appears to be symmetric about the vertical line \(x = 2\).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Points**:
   - \(A = (-1, 0)\)
   - \(B = (0, 8)\)
   - \(C = (2, 0)\)
   - \(D = (4, 0)\)
2. **Line**:
   - All points lie on the line defined by the coordinate system (\(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis).

#### Key Question:
We need to determine whether the given curve has an inverse function. For a function to have an inverse, it must pass the **Horizontal Line Test**: No horizontal line can intersect the graph at more than one point.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Horizontal Line Test
- The Horizontal Line Test checks if any horizontal line intersects the graph at more than one point.
- From the image, observe the behavior of the curve:
  - At \(y = 0\), the curve intersects the \(x\)-axis at three points: \((-1, 0)\), \((2, 0)\), and \((4, 0)\).
  - This means a horizontal line at \(y = 0\) intersects the graph at multiple points.

#### Step 2.2: Conclusion from the Horizontal Line Test
- Since there exists at least one horizontal line (specifically, \(y = 0\)) that intersects the graph at more than one point, the curve does not satisfy the Horizontal Line Test.
- Therefore, the curve does not represent a one-to-one function, and hence it does not have an inverse function.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the deduction above, the curve fails the Horizontal Line Test and thus does not have an inverse function. The correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
