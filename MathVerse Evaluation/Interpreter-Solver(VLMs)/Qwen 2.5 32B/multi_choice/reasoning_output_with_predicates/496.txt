QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph depicts a quadratic function \( f \).
- The function opens upward, as indicated by its parabolic shape.
- The function intersects the x-axis at two points: \( (0, 0) \) and \( (20, 0) \).
- These points are the roots of the quadratic function.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnCurve((0,0),f)**: The point \( (0, 0) \) lies on the curve \( f \).
2. **PointLiesOnCurve((20,0),f)**: The point \( (20, 0) \) lies on the curve \( f \).
3. **IsQuadraticFunction(f)**: The function \( f \) is a quadratic function.
4. **Shape(f)**: The shape of \( f \) is a parabola, consistent with the image.

#### Key Observations:
- The quadratic function has roots at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 20 \).
- Since the parabola opens upward, it is symmetric about its vertex.
- The general form of a quadratic function with roots at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 20 \) is:
  \[
  f(x) = a(x - 0)(x - 20) = ax(x - 20)
  \]
  where \( a > 0 \) because the parabola opens upward.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding One-to-One Functions
A function is **one-to-one** if every horizontal line intersects the graph at most once. This means no two distinct \( x \)-values can map to the same \( y \)-value.

#### Step 2.2: Analyzing the Quadratic Function
1. **Vertex of the Parabola**: The vertex of the parabola is the lowest point on the graph since the parabola opens upward. The vertex occurs at the midpoint of the roots \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 20 \):
   \[
   x_{\text{vertex}} = \frac{0 + 20}{2} = 10
   \]
   Substituting \( x = 10 \) into the function \( f(x) = ax(x - 20) \):
   \[
   f(10) = a(10)(10 - 20) = a(10)(-10) = -100a
   \]
   Thus, the vertex is at \( (10, -100a) \).

2. **Symmetry of the Parabola**: The parabola is symmetric about the vertical line \( x = 10 \). For any \( y \)-value above the vertex, there will be **two corresponding \( x \)-values** (one on each side of the vertex).

3. **Horizontal Line Test**: Consider a horizontal line \( y = c \) where \( c > -100a \). This line will intersect the parabola at two points, one on the left side of the vertex and one on the right side. This is a direct consequence of the symmetry and upward-opening nature of the parabola.

#### Step 2.3: Conclusion from the Horizontal Line Test
Since there exist horizontal lines that intersect the graph of \( f \) at more than one point, the function \( f \) fails the horizontal line test. Therefore, \( f \) is **not one-to-one**.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the analysis, the function \( f \) is not one-to-one because it fails the horizontal line test. The correct choice is:
