QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Image:
- The graph shows a straight line passing through points with coordinates approximately \((-6, 0)\) and \((0, 2)\).
- The line has a positive slope, as it rises from left to right.

#### Predicates Provided:
1. **Point(A)**: A point labeled \(A\) exists.
2. **Point(B)**: A point labeled \(B\) exists.
3. **Line(A,B)**: A line passing through points \(A\) and \(B\).
4. **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(A,B))**: Point \(A\) lies on the line through \(A\) and \(B\).
5. **PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,B))**: Point \(B\) lies on the line through \(A\) and \(B\).
6. **Equals(A, (-6, 0))**: The coordinates of point \(A\) are \((-6, 0)\).
7. **Equals(B, (0, 2))**: The coordinates of point \(B\) are \((0, 2)\).
8. **Perpendicular(Line(A,(0,0)), Line(B,(0,0)))**: This predicate does not directly apply to the problem, as it involves lines through \((0,0)\), which are not relevant here.

#### Key Observations:
- The line passes through the points \((-6, 0)\) and \((0, 2)\).
- The slope of the line is positive, as indicated by the upward trend in the graph.
- The question asks whether the function representing this line has an inverse function.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the equation of the line
To find the equation of the line, we use the两点式 (two-point form) formula for the slope \(m\):
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substitute the coordinates of points \(A(-6, 0)\) and \(B(0, 2)\):
\[
m = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - (-6)} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
The slope \(m\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

Next, use the point-slope form of the line equation:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
Using point \(A(-6, 0)\):
\[
y - 0 = \frac{1}{3}(x + 6) \implies y = \frac{1}{3}x + 2
\]
Thus, the equation of the line is:
\[
y = \frac{1}{3}x + 2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Check if the function has an inverse
A function has an inverse if it is one-to-one (i.e., it passes the horizontal line test). For a linear function \(y = mx + b\), the function is one-to-one if its slope \(m\) is nonzero. Here, the slope \(m = \frac{1}{3}\) is positive and nonzero, so the function is strictly increasing.

Since the function \(y = \frac{1}{3}x + 2\) is strictly increasing, it is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse function.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The line represented by the equation \(y = \frac{1}{3}x + 2\) is a one-to-one function because it has a positive slope. Therefore, it has an inverse function.
