QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows the function \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \).
- Key points on the graph include:
  - \( (-1, -1) \)
  - \( (0, 0) \)
  - \( (1, -1) \)
  - \( (2, 2) \)
- The graph intersects the \( x \)-axis at \( x = -1 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( x = 1 \).

#### From Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x))**: The point \( (0, 0) \) lies on the \( x \)-axis.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(y))**: The point \( (0, 0) \) lies on the \( y \)-axis.
3. **Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y))**: The \( x \)-axis and \( y \)-axis are perpendicular.
4. **Equals(y, Pow(x,3)-Pow(x,2)-x)**: The equation of the curve is \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \).

#### Question:
We need to determine how many solutions the equation \( x^3 - x^2 - x = -2 \) has. This is equivalent to finding the number of \( x \)-values where the graph of \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) intersects the horizontal line \( y = -2 \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Graph
The graph of \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) is a cubic polynomial. Cubic polynomials have the following general properties:
- They can have up to three real roots.
- They change direction at their critical points (where the derivative is zero).

From the graph:
- The function starts from the bottom left, rises, dips down, and then rises again.
- It crosses the \( x \)-axis at \( x = -1 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( x = 1 \).

#### Step 2.2: Locate the Line \( y = -2 \)
The horizontal line \( y = -2 \) is below the \( x \)-axis. We need to determine how many times the graph of \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) intersects this line.

- **Left Side of the Graph**: As \( x \to -\infty \), \( y \to -\infty \). The graph starts below \( y = -2 \) and rises.
- **Between \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 0 \)**: The graph dips down and crosses the \( x \)-axis at \( x = -1 \). It continues to dip further and then rises again.
- **Between \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \)**: The graph crosses the \( x \)-axis at \( x = 0 \) and continues to dip down, reaching its minimum before rising.
- **Right Side of the Graph**: As \( x \to +\infty \), \( y \to +\infty \). The graph rises indefinitely.

#### Step 2.3: Count the Intersections
By examining the graph:
- The graph crosses \( y = -2 \) once in the interval \( x < -1 \).
- The graph does not cross \( y = -2 \) between \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \).
- The graph crosses \( y = -2 \) again in the interval \( x > 1 \).

Thus, there are **two intersections** between the graph of \( y = x^3 - x^2 - x \) and the line \( y = -2 \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The equation \( x^3 - x^2 - x = -2 \) has **two solutions** because the graph intersects the line \( y = -2 \) at two points.
