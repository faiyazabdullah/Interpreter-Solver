### Analysis and Solution:

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
1. **Image Observation**: The graph depicts a parabola that opens upwards. The vertex appears to be at the point \((0, 2)\), and the parabola is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis.
2. **Predicates**:
   - **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,2), Shape(Parabola))**: This indicates that the point \((0, 2)\) lies on the given parabola.
   - **Shape(Parabola)**: The graph is identified as a parabola.
3. **Question**: Determine whether the given parabola, which passes through \((0, 2)\) and opens upwards, has an inverse function.

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**
1. **Definition of Inverse Function**:
   - A function \( f(x) \) has an inverse if and only if it is one-to-one (injective). This means that for every \( y \) in the range of \( f \), there is exactly one \( x \) such that \( f(x) = y \).
   - Graphically, a function has an inverse if it passes the **horizontal line test**: No horizontal line intersects the graph more than once.

2. **Properties of the Parabola**:
   - The given parabola opens upwards and is symmetric about the \( y \)-axis. This symmetry implies that for any positive \( x \)-value, there is a corresponding negative \( x \)-value that maps to the same \( y \)-value.
   - For example, if the point \((a, b)\) lies on the parabola, then \((-a, b)\) also lies on the parabola due to symmetry.

3. **Horizontal Line Test**:
   - Consider a horizontal line \( y = k \) (where \( k \) is a constant). For a parabola that opens upwards and is symmetric about the \( y \)-axis, this horizontal line will intersect the parabola at two points (one on the left side and one on the right side) unless \( k \) corresponds to the vertex.
   - Since the parabola is symmetric and opens upwards, it fails the horizontal line test because multiple \( x \)-values map to the same \( y \)-value.

4. **Conclusion from the Horizontal Line Test**:
   - Because the parabola fails the horizontal line test, it is not a one-to-one function. Therefore, it does not have an inverse function.

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
- Based on the reasoning above, the given parabola does not have an inverse function.
