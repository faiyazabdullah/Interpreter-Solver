QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and given predicates, we identify the following:
1. **Angles in the figure**: The large triangle has angles labeled \(a^\circ\), \(b^\circ\), and \(x^\circ\). There is also a smaller triangle inside the larger one, with angles \(a^\circ\), \(b^\circ\), and \(126^\circ\).
2. **Key relationships**:
   - \(a + b = 54\) (given predicate).
   - One of the angles in the smaller triangle is \(126^\circ\).
   - The sum of the angles in any triangle is \(180^\circ\).

The goal is to find the value of \(x\).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Use the properties of the smaller triangle**
The smaller triangle has angles \(a^\circ\), \(b^\circ\), and \(126^\circ\). By the triangle angle sum property:
\[
a + b + 126 = 180
\]
We are given that \(a + b = 54\). Substituting this into the equation:
\[
54 + 126 = 180
\]
This confirms the consistency of the given information.

#### **Step 2.2: Use the properties of the larger triangle**
The larger triangle has angles \(a^\circ\), \(b^\circ\), and \(x^\circ\). By the triangle angle sum property:
\[
a + b + x = 180
\]
We already know that \(a + b = 54\). Substituting this into the equation:
\[
54 + x = 180
\]
Solving for \(x\):
\[
x = 180 - 54 = 126
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Verify the solution**
The value of \(x\) must satisfy all given conditions:
1. \(a + b = 54\).
2. The sum of the angles in the smaller triangle is \(180^\circ\).
3. The sum of the angles in the larger triangle is \(180^\circ\).

All conditions are satisfied, so the value of \(x\) is correct.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The value of \(x\) is \(72\). Therefore, the correct choice is:
