### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The image shows a vertical blue line passing through the point \((6, 0)\).
- This line is parallel to the \(y\)-axis.

#### Predicates:
1. **Point(A)**, **Point(B)**, **Point(C)**: These represent generic points.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B,C))**: Point \(A\) lies on the line defined by points \(B\) and \(C\).
3. **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(B,C))**: Redundant but confirms that \(A\) lies on the line.
4. **Parallel(Line(B,C), Line(y))**: The line defined by points \(B\) and \(C\) is parallel to the \(y\)-axis.
5. **Perpendicular(Line(B,C), Line(x))**: The line defined by points \(B\) and \(C\) is perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis.
6. **PointLiesOnLine((6,0), Line(B,C))**: The point \((6, 0)\) lies on the line defined by points \(B\) and \(C\).

#### Key Observations:
- The line is vertical because it is parallel to the \(y\)-axis.
- Vertical lines have an undefined slope in Cartesian geometry.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Interpret the Parallelism
- From the predicate **Parallel(Line(B,C), Line(y))**, the line \(BC\) is parallel to the \(y\)-axis.
- By definition, lines parallel to the \(y\)-axis are vertical lines.

#### Step 2.2: Confirm Perpendicularity
- From the predicate **Perpendicular(Line(B,C), Line(x))**, the line \(BC\) is perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis.
- Vertical lines are indeed perpendicular to the horizontal \(x\)-axis.

#### Step 2.3: Identify the Line's Position
- From the predicate **PointLiesOnLine((6,0), Line(B,C))**, the line \(BC\) passes through the point \((6, 0)\).
- Since the line is vertical and passes through \((6, 0)\), its equation is \(x = 6\).

#### Step 2.4: Determine the Slope
- In Cartesian coordinates, the slope \(m\) of a line is defined as the change in \(y\) divided by the change in \(x\): \(m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\).
- For a vertical line, \(\Delta x = 0\) because the \(x\)-coordinate remains constant.
- Division by zero is undefined, so the slope of a vertical line is undefined.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The slope of the given vertical line is undefined. Therefore, the correct choice is:
