QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and given predicates, we have the following information:
1. **Parallel Lines**: $ \text{Parallel}(Line(a), Line(b)) $
   - This means lines $ a $ and $ b $ are parallel.
2. **Angles**:
   - $ \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1), 158.0) $
   - $ \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(2), 42.0) $
   - $ \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(4), 50.0) $
   - We need to find $ \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) $.

The image shows:
- Angle 1 is an exterior angle formed by a transversal intersecting line $ a $.
- Angle 2 is adjacent to angle 1.
- Angle 3 is an interior angle on the same side of the transversal as angle 2.
- Angle 4 is an interior angle on the same side of the transversal as angle 3, and it lies on line $ b $.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Determine the relationship between angles 1 and 2
- Angles 1 and 2 form a linear pair because they are adjacent and lie on a straight line.
- By the Linear Pair Postulate, the sum of the measures of a linear pair is $ 180^\circ $.
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(2)) = 180^\circ
  $$
  Substituting the given values:
  $$
  158^\circ + 42^\circ = 180^\circ
  $$
  This confirms the relationship.

#### Step 2.2: Use the property of parallel lines
- Since lines $ a $ and $ b $ are parallel, the corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and same-side interior angles have specific relationships.
- Angle 3 and angle 4 are same-side interior angles (also known as consecutive interior angles) formed by the transversal intersecting the parallel lines $ a $ and $ b $.
- By the Same-Side Interior Angles Theorem, the sum of the measures of same-side interior angles is $ 180^\circ $.
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(4)) = 180^\circ
  $$
  Substituting the given value for angle 4:
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) + 50^\circ = 180^\circ
  $$

#### Step 2.3: Solve for the measure of angle 3
- Rearrange the equation to solve for $ \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) $:
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
  $$

However, upon re-evaluating the problem, we notice that angle 3 is actually part of a triangle formed by the transversal and the parallel lines. Let's reanalyze using the triangle properties.

#### Step 2.4: Reanalyze using triangle properties
- The triangle formed by the transversal and the parallel lines includes angles 2, 3, and another angle (let's call it angle 5) which is vertically opposite to angle 4.
- Since angle 4 is $ 50^\circ $, its vertically opposite angle (angle 5) is also $ 50^\circ $.
- In the triangle, the sum of the interior angles is $ 180^\circ $:
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(2)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(5)) = 180^\circ
  $$
  Substituting the known values:
  $$
  42^\circ + \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) + 50^\circ = 180^\circ
  $$
  Simplify:
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) + 92^\circ = 180^\circ
  $$
  $$
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) = 180^\circ - 92^\circ = 88^\circ
  $$

Upon further review, the correct interpretation should be directly using the same-side interior angles theorem without the triangle misinterpretation. The correct calculation is:
$$
\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(3)) = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ - 60^\circ = 70^\circ
$$

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The correct measure of angle 3 is $ 70^\circ $.
