QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
1. **Lines and Intersection**: Lines \(a\) and \(b\) intersect at point \(O\).
2. **Angles**: Angle 1 is labeled, and its measure is given as \(50^\circ\).
3. **Relationships**: Angles 1 and 2 are adjacent angles formed by the intersection of lines \(a\) and \(b\).
4. **Goal**: Determine the measure of angle 2.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify the type of angles
- Angles 1 and 2 are **adjacent angles** because they share a common vertex (\(O\)) and a common side (the ray extending from \(O\) along line \(a\)).
- Adjacent angles that form a straight line are supplementary. This means their measures add up to \(180^\circ\).

#### Step 2.2: Apply the property of supplementary angles
- By the definition of supplementary angles:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle 1 + \text{Measure of } \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substituting the given measure of \(\angle 1\):
  \[
  50^\circ + \text{Measure of } \angle 2 = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for the measure of \(\angle 2\)
- Rearrange the equation to isolate \(\text{Measure of } \angle 2\):
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle 2 = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of \(\angle 2\) is \(130^\circ\). Therefore, the correct choice is:
