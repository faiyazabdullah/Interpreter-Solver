QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The graph shows the function \( y = 2^x \).
2. The graph extends infinitely to the right and left along the \( x \)-axis.
3. The \( y \)-intercept is at \( (0, 1) \), which means when \( x = 0 \), \( y = 2^0 = 1 \).
4. All \( y \)-values are positive, as indicated by the graph lying entirely above the \( x \)-axis.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Predicate**: \( Equals(Pow(2, x), y) \)
   - This confirms the function being graphed is \( y = 2^x \).

2. **Predicate**: \( Line(x) \) and \( Line(y) \)
   - These indicate the presence of the \( x \)-axis and \( y \)-axis as reference lines.

3. **Predicate**: \( Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y)) \)
   - This confirms that the \( x \)-axis and \( y \)-axis are perpendicular to each other, which is standard for Cartesian coordinates.

#### Key Observations:
- The function \( y = 2^x \) is defined for all real numbers \( x \).
- The graph extends indefinitely in both the positive and negative directions along the \( x \)-axis.
- The \( y \)-intercept is \( (0, 1) \), and all \( y \)-values are positive.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Domain of \( y = 2^x \)
- The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (\( x \)) for which the function is defined.
- For the exponential function \( y = 2^x \):
  - There are no restrictions on \( x \). The base \( 2 \) is positive, and raising a positive number to any real power is always defined.
  - Therefore, \( x \) can take any real value.

#### Step 2.2: Verifying the Graph
- The graph in the image supports this observation:
  - The curve extends infinitely to the left (\( x \to -\infty \)) and to the right (\( x \to \infty \)).
  - There are no breaks or discontinuities in the graph, indicating that \( x \) can take all real values.

#### Step 2.3: Matching the Domain to the Choices
- **Choice A**: \( x \geq 0 \)
  - This restricts the domain to non-negative \( x \)-values only, which is incorrect because the graph extends to negative \( x \)-values.
  
- **Choice B**: \( x > 0 \)
  - This restricts the domain to positive \( x \)-values only, which is also incorrect because the graph includes \( x = 0 \) and extends to negative \( x \)-values.
  
- **Choice C**: All real \( x \)
  - This matches the observation that \( x \) can take any real value, as the graph extends indefinitely in both directions.
  
- **Choice D**: \( x < 0 \)
  - This restricts the domain to negative \( x \)-values only, which is incorrect because the graph includes \( x = 0 \) and extends to positive \( x \)-values.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The domain of the function \( y = 2^x \) is all real numbers \( x \). This is consistent with the graph, which extends indefinitely in both the positive and negative directions along the \( x \)-axis.
