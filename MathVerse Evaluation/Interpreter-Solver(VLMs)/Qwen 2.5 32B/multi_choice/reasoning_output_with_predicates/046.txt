### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the geometric figure:
1. **Points**: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).
2. **Lines**: \( AB \) and \( CD \) are parallel (\( AB \parallel CD \)).
3. **Angles**: 
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A)) = 70^\circ \), so \( \angle A = 70^\circ \).
   - Angle \( 1 \) is formed by the intersection of lines \( AB \) and \( CD \) with a transversal passing through point \( C \).

The problem asks us to determine the measure of \( \angle 1 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understand the Role of Parallel Lines
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), the properties of parallel lines and transversals apply. Specifically:
  - Corresponding angles are equal.
  - Alternate interior angles are equal.
  - Consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) are supplementary.

#### Step 2.2: Identify Relevant Angles
- In the figure, \( \angle A \) is given as \( 70^\circ \). This angle is formed between line \( AB \) and the transversal.
- \( \angle 1 \) is the angle formed between line \( CD \) and the same transversal, directly opposite \( \angle A \).

#### Step 2.3: Apply the Property of Corresponding Angles
- When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal. Here:
  - \( \angle A \) and \( \angle 1 \) are corresponding angles because they are on the same side of the transversal and above their respective parallel lines.
  - By the property of corresponding angles, \( \angle 1 = \angle A \).

#### Step 2.4: Calculate the Measure of \( \angle 1 \)
- Since \( \angle A = 70^\circ \) and \( \angle 1 \) is a corresponding angle to \( \angle A \):
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1)) = 70^\circ
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 70^\circ \). Therefore, the correct choice is:
