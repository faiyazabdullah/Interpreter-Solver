QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **ABCE is a Square**:
   - The square has vertices \( A, B, C, \) and \( E \).
   - All sides of the square are equal in length.
   - The area of the square is given as 1.

2. **CDE is an Equilateral Triangle**:
   - The triangle has vertices \( C, D, \) and \( E \).
   - All sides of the triangle are equal in length.

3. **Relationships Between Figures**:
   - Side \( CE \) is shared between the square \( ABCE \) and the equilateral triangle \( CDE \).
   - Since \( ABCE \) is a square, all its sides are equal, and the side length can be determined from its area.
   - Since \( CDE \) is an equilateral triangle, all its sides are equal to the length of \( CE \).

4. **Key Measurements**:
   - The area of the square \( ABCE \) is 1. Therefore, if the side length of the square is \( s \), then \( s^2 = 1 \), so \( s = 1 \).
   - The side length of the square is equal to the side length of the equilateral triangle \( CDE \).

#### Specific Value Requested:
- We need to find the perimeter of the pentagon \( ABCDE \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Side Length of the Square
- The area of the square \( ABCE \) is given as 1.
- Let the side length of the square be \( s \). Then:
  \[
  s^2 = 1 \implies s = 1
  \]
- Therefore, the side lengths of the square \( AB, BC, CE, \) and \( EA \) are all equal to 1.

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Side Length of the Equilateral Triangle
- The side \( CE \) is a side of both the square and the equilateral triangle.
- Since \( CE = 1 \) (from the square), the side lengths of the equilateral triangle \( CDE \) are also 1.
- Thus, \( CD = DE = CE = 1 \).

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Perimeter of Polygon \( ABCDE \)
- The perimeter of polygon \( ABCDE \) is the sum of the lengths of all its sides:
  \[
  AB + BC + CE + ED + DA
  \]
- From the square \( ABCE \):
  - \( AB = 1 \)
  - \( BC = 1 \)
  - \( CE = 1 \)
  - \( EA = 1 \)
- From the equilateral triangle \( CDE \):
  - \( CD = 1 \)
  - \( DE = 1 \)
- However, \( CE \) is shared between the square and the triangle, so it should not be counted twice.
- Therefore, the perimeter is:
  \[
  AB + BC + CE + DE + DA = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The perimeter of polygon \( ABCDE \) is 5. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
