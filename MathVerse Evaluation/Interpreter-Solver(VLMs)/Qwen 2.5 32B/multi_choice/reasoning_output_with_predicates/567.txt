### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a parabola labeled \( y = g(x) \).
- The parabola opens downward.
- The vertex of the parabola is at \((-5, 6)\).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Predicate 1**: \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function.
2. **Predicate 2**: The vertex of \( g(x) \) is \((-5, 6)\).
3. **Predicate 3**: \( f(x) = 4x^2 - 108 \) is also a quadratic function.
4. **Predicate 4**: The question asks whether \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) have the same concavity.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Analyze the Concavity of \( g(x) \)**
- From the image, \( g(x) \) is a parabola that opens downward.
- For a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \), the concavity is determined by the coefficient \( a \):
  - If \( a > 0 \), the parabola opens upward (concave up).
  - If \( a < 0 \), the parabola opens downward (concave down).
- Since \( g(x) \) opens downward, it is concave down.

#### **Step 2.2: Analyze the Concavity of \( f(x) \)**
- The given function is \( f(x) = 4x^2 - 108 \).
- This is a quadratic function in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), where:
  - \( a = 4 \)
  - \( b = 0 \)
  - \( c = -108 \)
- The coefficient \( a \) determines the concavity:
  - Here, \( a = 4 > 0 \), so \( f(x) \) opens upward.
  - Therefore, \( f(x) \) is concave up.

#### **Step 2.3: Compare the Concavities of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \)**
- \( g(x) \) is concave down.
- \( f(x) \) is concave up.
- Since the concavities are opposite, \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) do not have the same concavity.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the analysis:
- \( f(x) \) is concave up.
- \( g(x) \) is concave down.
- Therefore, the correct choice is that \( f(x) \) is concave up and \( g(x) \) is concave down.
