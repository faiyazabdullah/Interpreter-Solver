### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Elements:
- The left figure represents a cone.
- The right figure represents a semicircle with a radius of 10.0.
- The semicircle is given as the expanded lateral surface of the cone.

#### Predicates:
1. **Shape(Cone(1))**: The left figure is a cone.
2. **Shape(Semicircle(2))**: The right figure is a semicircle.
3. **RadiusOf(Semicircle(2))**: The radius of the semicircle is 10.0.
4. **LengthOf(RadiusOf(Semicircle(2)))**: The length of the radius of the semicircle is 10.0.
5. **CircumferenceOf(Circle(3))**: The circumference of a full circle is \(2 \pi \times \text{radius}\).
6. **RadiusOf(Circle(3))**: The radius of the circle is related to the semicircle.
7. **Arc(4)**: The arc length of the semicircle.
8. **LengthOf(Arc(4))**: The length of the arc is half the circumference of a full circle with radius 10.0.
9. **Equals(LengthOf(Arc(4)), CircumferenceOf(Circle(3)))**: The arc length of the semicircle is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.

#### Key Measurements:
- Radius of the semicircle (\(R\)): 10.0
- The arc length of the semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle with radius 10.0.

#### Question:
We need to find the radius of the base of the cone.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Relate the semicircle to the cone's lateral surface.
- The semicircle represents the lateral surface of the cone when it is "unrolled."
- The radius of the semicircle (\(R = 10.0\)) corresponds to the slant height (\(l\)) of the cone.
- The arc length of the semicircle is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the arc length of the semicircle.
- The circumference of a full circle with radius \(R = 10.0\) is:
  \[
  2 \pi R = 2 \pi \times 10.0 = 20\pi
  \]
- Since the semicircle is half of a full circle, the arc length of the semicircle is:
  \[
  \text{Arc length} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20\pi = 10\pi
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Relate the arc length to the base circumference of the cone.
- The arc length of the semicircle is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone.
- Let \(r\) be the radius of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base of the cone is:
  \[
  2 \pi r
  \]
- Equating the arc length of the semicircle to the circumference of the base of the cone:
  \[
  2 \pi r = 10\pi
  \]

#### Step 2.4: Solve for \(r\).
- Divide both sides by \(2\pi\):
  \[
  r = \frac{10\pi}{2\pi} = 5
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The radius of the base of the cone is \(r = 5\).
