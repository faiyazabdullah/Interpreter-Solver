### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the image:
1. **Quadrilateral(1)** and **Quadrilateral(2)** represent two quadrilaterals.
2. Quadrilateral(1) is blue, and Quadrilateral(2) is green.
3. The diagonal lengths are:
   - **LengthOf(A) = 8 yd** (diagonal of the blue quadrilateral).
   - **LengthOf(B) = 4 yd** (diagonal of the green quadrilateral).
4. The area of the blue quadrilateral is:
   - **AreaOf(1) = 36 yd²**.
5. The quadrilaterals are similar:
   - **Similar(1, 2)**.
6. We need to find the area of the green quadrilateral, **AreaOf(2)**.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Relationship Between Similar Figures
When two figures are similar, their corresponding linear dimensions are proportional, and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions.

Let the ratio of the diagonals of the blue quadrilateral to the green quadrilateral be:
\[ \text{Ratio of diagonals} = \frac{\text{LengthOf(A)}}{\text{LengthOf(B)}} = \frac{8}{4} = 2. \]

#### Step 2.2: Area Ratio of Similar Figures
The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their corresponding linear dimensions. Therefore, the ratio of the areas of the blue quadrilateral to the green quadrilateral is:
\[ \text{Ratio of areas} = \left(\frac{\text{LengthOf(A)}}{\text{LengthOf(B)}}\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4. \]

This means:
\[ \frac{\text{AreaOf(1)}}{\text{AreaOf(2)}} = 4. \]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for the Area of the Green Quadrilateral
We know:
\[ \text{AreaOf(1)} = 36 \, \text{yd}^2. \]
Using the area ratio:
\[ \frac{\text{AreaOf(1)}}{\text{AreaOf(2)}} = 4 \implies \frac{36}{\text{AreaOf(2)}} = 4. \]

Solving for **AreaOf(2)**:
\[ \text{AreaOf(2)} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \, \text{yd}^2. \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The area of the green quadrilateral is **9 yd²**. Therefore, the correct choice is:
\[ \text{Final Answer: A} \]

Final Answer: A
