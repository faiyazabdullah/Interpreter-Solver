QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and given predicates:
1. **Figure Type**: The figure is a parallelogram (Parallelogram1).
2. **Side Lengths**:
   - One side (Side1) has a length of 20 cm.
   - Another side (Side2) has a length of 12 cm.
3. **Angles**:
   - One angle (Angle1) measures 60Â°.
4. **Relationships**:
   - Side1 and Side2 are adjacent sides of the parallelogram.
   - In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length.

The question asks for the perimeter of the parallelogram. The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all four sides.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Properties of a Parallelogram
- In a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal in length.
  - Since Side1 = 20 cm, the opposite side (let's call it Side3) is also 20 cm.
  - Since Side2 = 12 cm, the opposite side (let's call it Side4) is also 12 cm.

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Perimeter
- The perimeter \( P \) of a parallelogram is given by:
  \[
  P = \text{Sum of all four sides} = \text{Side1} + \text{Side2} + \text{Side3} + \text{Side4}
  \]
- Substituting the known values:
  \[
  P = 20 + 12 + 20 + 12
  \]
- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  P = 64 \text{ cm}
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Verify the Calculation
- The perimeter formula for a parallelogram is consistent with the property that opposite sides are equal.
- The calculation \( 20 + 12 + 20 + 12 = 64 \) is correct.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The perimeter of the parallelogram is 64 cm. This matches choice C.
