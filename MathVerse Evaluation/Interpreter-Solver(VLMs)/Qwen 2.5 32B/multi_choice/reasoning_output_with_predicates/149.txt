### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the problem and the given predicates, we extract the following key points:
1. **Geometric Configuration**:
   - $CD$ is a plane mirror.
   - Light is emitted from point $A$, reflects at point $E$ on $CD$, and reaches point $B$.
   - $AC \perp CD$ and $BD \perp CD$, with $C$ and $D$ being the feet of the perpendiculars.
   - $AC = 3.0$, $BD = 6.0$, and $CD = 10.0$.
   - The incident angle at $E$ is $\alpha$, and the reflection follows the law of reflection: the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

2. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since $AC \perp CD$ and $BD \perp CD$, triangles $ACE$ and $BDE$ are right triangles.
   - The problem states that the incident angle at $E$ is $\alpha$, which implies symmetry in the reflection process.
   - The distances $AC$, $BD$, and $CD$ are given, and we need to find the length of $ED$.

3. **Objective**:
   - Determine the length of the line segment $ED$.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Use the Law of Reflection
The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This implies that the path of the light ray from $A$ to $E$ to $B$ can be treated as if it were a straight line in a reflected coordinate system. Specifically:
- Reflect point $B$ across the line $CD$ to a new point $B'$ such that $B'$ lies directly above $C$ and $DB' = DB = 6.0$.
- The path $A \to E \to B$ is equivalent to the straight-line path $A \to B'$ in the reflected configuration.

#### Step 2.2: Coordinates and Geometry
Place the points in a coordinate system for clarity:
- Let $C = (0, 0)$ and $D = (10, 0)$.
- Point $A$ is at $(0, 3)$ because $AC = 3.0$.
- Point $B$ is at $(10, 6)$ because $BD = 6.0$.
- Reflect $B$ across $CD$ to get $B'$ at $(10, -6)$.

#### Step 2.3: Straight-Line Path in the Reflected System
In the reflected system, the path $A \to B'$ is a straight line. The coordinates of $A$ and $B'$ are:
- $A = (0, 3)$
- $B' = (10, -6)$

The equation of the straight line passing through $A$ and $B'$ can be found using the two-point form of the line equation:
\[
y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)
\]
Substitute $A = (0, 3)$ and $B' = (10, -6)$:
\[
y - 3 = \frac{-6 - 3}{10 - 0}(x - 0) \implies y - 3 = -\frac{9}{10}x \implies y = -\frac{9}{10}x + 3
\]

#### Step 2.4: Find the Intersection Point $E$
Point $E$ is the intersection of the line $y = -\frac{9}{10}x + 3$ with the line $CD$, which is the x-axis ($y = 0$). Set $y = 0$ in the line equation:
\[
0 = -\frac{9}{10}x + 3 \implies \frac{9}{10}x = 3 \implies x = \frac{30}{9} = \frac{10}{3}
\]
Thus, the coordinates of $E$ are $\left(\frac{10}{3}, 0\right)$.

#### Step 2.5: Calculate the Length of $ED$
The length of $ED$ is the horizontal distance between $E$ and $D$. Since $D = (10, 0)$ and $E = \left(\frac{10}{3}, 0\right)$, the distance is:
\[
ED = 10 - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{30}{3} - \frac{10}{3} = \frac{20}{3}
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The length of the line segment $ED$ is $\frac{20}{3}$. Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
