QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the image:
1. **Points**: \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are points.
2. **Lines**: Line \( AB \) and Line \( CD \) are present.
3. **Parallel Lines**: Line \( AB \) is parallel to Line \( CD \).
4. **Angle Measurement**: The measure of \( \angle B \) is given as 20°.
5. **Question**: We need to determine the measure of \( \angle C \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Understand the Parallel Line Property
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), we can use properties of parallel lines and transversals.
- When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles are equal, alternate interior angles are equal, and consecutive interior angles are supplementary.

#### Step 2.2: Identify the Transversal
- In the given figure, \( AC \) and \( BD \) act as transversals cutting the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- Focus on the angles formed by these transversals.

#### Step 2.3: Analyze \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \)
- \( \angle B \) is an angle formed by the transversal \( BD \) intersecting the parallel lines \( AB \) and \( CD \).
- Since \( AB \parallel CD \), \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \) are **corresponding angles** because they are on the same side of the transversal \( BD \) and above the parallel lines.
- By the **Corresponding Angles Theorem**, corresponding angles are congruent when the lines are parallel.

#### Step 2.4: Apply the Corresponding Angles Theorem
- According to the Corresponding Angles Theorem:
  \[
  \text{If } AB \parallel CD \text{ and } BD \text{ is a transversal, then } \angle B = \angle C.
  \]
- Given \( \angle B = 20^\circ \), it follows that:
  \[
  \angle C = 20^\circ.
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The measure of \( \angle C \) is \( 20^\circ \).
- Comparing this result with the given choices:
  - A: 40°
  - B: 20°
  - C: 60°
  - D: 70°

The correct choice is \( B \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: B
