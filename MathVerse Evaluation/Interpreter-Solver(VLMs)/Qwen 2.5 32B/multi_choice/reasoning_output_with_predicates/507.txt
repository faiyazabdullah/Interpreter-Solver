QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a straight line passing through two points: 
  - One point is on the y-axis at \( (0, 3) \). This is the y-intercept.
  - Another point is on the x-axis at \( (-8, 0) \). This is the x-intercept.
- The line has a positive slope, indicating it rises from left to right.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(-8,0), Line($))**: The point \( (-8, 0) \) lies on the line.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,3), Line($))**: The point \( (0, 3) \) lies on the line.
3. **IntersectionOf(Line(x_axis), Line($), Point(-8,0))**: The line intersects the x-axis at \( (-8, 0) \).
4. **IntersectionOf(Line(y_axis), Line($), Point(0,3))**: The line intersects the y-axis at \( (0, 3) \).
5. **Perpendicular(Line(x_axis), Line(y_axis))**: The x-axis and y-axis are perpendicular (this is standard in Cartesian coordinates).

#### Key Observations:
- The y-intercept is given as \( (0, 3) \).
- The x-intercept is given as \( (-8, 0) \).
- The task is to determine the equation of the line.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: General Equation of a Line
The general form of a line's equation is:
\[ Ax + By = C \]

We know two points on the line:
- \( (x_1, y_1) = (-8, 0) \)
- \( (x_2, y_2) = (0, 3) \)

#### Step 2.2: Slope of the Line
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Substitute the points \( (-8, 0) \) and \( (0, 3) \):
\[ m = \frac{3 - 0}{0 - (-8)} = \frac{3}{8} \]

#### Step 2.3: Point-Slope Form
Using the point-slope form of the line equation:
\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]

Choose the point \( (0, 3) \) and the slope \( m = \frac{3}{8} \):
\[ y - 3 = \frac{3}{8}(x - 0) \]
\[ y - 3 = \frac{3}{8}x \]

#### Step 2.4: Convert to Standard Form
To convert to the standard form \( Ax + By = C \), eliminate the fraction by multiplying through by 8:
\[ 8(y - 3) = 3x \]
\[ 8y - 24 = 3x \]
\[ 3x - 8y = -24 \]

#### Step 2.5: Verify the Intercepts
- **y-intercept**: Set \( x = 0 \):
  \[ 3(0) - 8y = -24 \]
  \[ -8y = -24 \]
  \[ y = 3 \]
  This matches the given y-intercept \( (0, 3) \).

- **x-intercept**: Set \( y = 0 \):
  \[ 3x - 8(0) = -24 \]
  \[ 3x = -24 \]
  \[ x = -8 \]
  This matches the given x-intercept \( (-8, 0) \).

#### Step 2.6: Match with Choices
The derived equation is:
\[ 3x - 8y = -24 \]

This matches choice **B**.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The equation of the line, whose y-intercept is 3 and x-intercept is -8, is:
\[ 3x - 8y = -24 \]

Final Answer: B
