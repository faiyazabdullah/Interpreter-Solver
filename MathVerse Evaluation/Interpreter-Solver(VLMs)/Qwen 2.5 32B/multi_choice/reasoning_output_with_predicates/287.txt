====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### Visual Information:
- The image shows a triangle with one external angle labeled as \( \angle 1 \).
- Inside the triangle, two angles are given: \( 27^\circ \) and \( 52^\circ \).
- The external angle \( \angle 1 \) is adjacent to one of the internal angles of the triangle.

#### Predicates:
1. **Triangle(T1)**: There is a triangle labeled \( T1 \).
2. **MeasureOf(Angle(A1), 27)**: One internal angle of the triangle measures \( 27^\circ \).
3. **MeasureOf(Angle(A2), 52)**: Another internal angle of the triangle measures \( 52^\circ \).
4. **MeasureOf(Angle(1), X1)**: The measure of the external angle \( \angle 1 \) is unknown and denoted as \( X1 \).
5. **Angle(1)**: The external angle is explicitly mentioned.

#### Key Points:
- The problem asks for the measure of the external angle \( \angle 1 \).
- The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always \( 180^\circ \).
- The external angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Determine the Measure of the Third Internal Angle
- Let the third internal angle of the triangle be \( \theta \).
- By the Triangle Sum Theorem, the sum of the internal angles of a triangle is \( 180^\circ \):
  \[
  27^\circ + 52^\circ + \theta = 180^\circ
  \]
- Solving for \( \theta \):
  \[
  \theta = 180^\circ - 27^\circ - 52^\circ = 101^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Relate the External Angle to the Internal Angles
- The external angle \( \angle 1 \) is formed by extending one side of the triangle. According to the External Angle Theorem, the measure of an external angle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent internal angles.
- The two non-adjacent internal angles to \( \angle 1 \) are \( 27^\circ \) and \( 52^\circ \).
- Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Measure of } \angle 1 = 27^\circ + 52^\circ = 79^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Verify the Calculation
- The calculation is consistent with the External Angle Theorem.
- The third internal angle \( \theta = 101^\circ \) is correctly derived using the Triangle Sum Theorem.
- The external angle \( \angle 1 \) is indeed the sum of the two non-adjacent internal angles.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The measure of \( \angle 1 \) is \( 79^\circ \).
- Matching this with the given choices:
  - A: 21
  - B: 27
  - C: 52
  - D: 79

The correct choice is \( D \).

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: D
