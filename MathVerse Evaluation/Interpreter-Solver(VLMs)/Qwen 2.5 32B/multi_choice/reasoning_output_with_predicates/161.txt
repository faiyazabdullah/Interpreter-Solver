QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The figure depicts a triangle ruler and its projection under a light source.
- The triangle ruler and its projection form two similar triangles.
- The light source (denoted as "ÁÅØ") is positioned at a certain distance from the triangle ruler.
- The projection is created by extending lines from the light source through the vertices of the triangle ruler.

#### From Predicates:
1. **Similar(Triangle(1), Triangle(2))**: The triangle ruler and its projection are similar triangles.
2. **LengthOf(SideOf(Triangle(1))) Equals(8.0)**: One side of the triangle ruler has a length of 8.0 units.
3. **RatioOf(2.0, 5.0)**: The ratio of the distance from the light source to the vertex of the triangle ruler to the distance from the light source to the corresponding vertex of the projection is 2:5.

#### Key Relationships:
- Since the triangles are similar, the ratio of corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the distances from the light source to the respective vertices.
- The given ratio of distances (2:5) implies a scaling factor between the triangle ruler and its projection.

#### Question:
We need to determine the length of the corresponding edge of the projection triangle.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understand the Scaling Factor
The triangles are similar, so the ratio of their corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the distances from the light source to the respective vertices. The given ratio of distances is 2:5. This means:
- If the distance from the light source to a vertex of the triangle ruler is \( d_1 \), then the distance from the light source to the corresponding vertex of the projection is \( d_2 = \frac{5}{2}d_1 \).
- The scaling factor between the triangle ruler and its projection is therefore \( \frac{5}{2} \).

#### Step 2.2: Apply the Scaling Factor to the Side Length
The length of one side of the triangle ruler is given as 8.0 units. Since the triangles are similar and the scaling factor is \( \frac{5}{2} \), the corresponding side of the projection triangle will be:
\[
\text{Length of corresponding side of projection} = 8.0 \times \frac{5}{2}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Perform the Calculation
\[
8.0 \times \frac{5}{2} = 8.0 \times 2.5 = 20.0
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify the Result
The calculation is consistent with the properties of similar triangles and the given ratio. The scaling factor correctly scales the side length from the triangle ruler to its projection.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The corresponding edge length of the projection triangle is 20.0 units. Therefore, the correct choice is:
