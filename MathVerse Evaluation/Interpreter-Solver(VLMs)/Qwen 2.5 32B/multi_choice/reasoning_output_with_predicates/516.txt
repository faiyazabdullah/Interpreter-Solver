### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### Visual Information:
- The graph depicts the exponential function \( y = 4^x \).
- The curve is shown in the first quadrant, starting at \( (0, 1) \) and increasing rapidly as \( x \) increases.
- The \( y \)-axis is labeled, and the function appears to approach zero as \( x \) approaches negative infinity but never touches it.

#### Predicates:
- No explicit predicates are directly related to the given graph, but we can infer properties of the exponential function \( y = 4^x \):
  1. The base \( 4 \) is positive and greater than 1.
  2. Exponential functions with bases greater than 1 are always positive for all real values of \( x \).

#### Key Question:
We need to determine what can be said about the \( y \)-value of every point on the graph of \( y = 4^x \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Inference 1: Domain and Range of \( y = 4^x \)
- The domain of \( y = 4^x \) is all real numbers (\( x \in \mathbb{R} \)).
- The range of \( y = 4^x \) is all positive real numbers (\( y > 0 \)). This is because:
  - For any real number \( x \), \( 4^x \) is always positive (since \( 4 > 0 \)).
  - As \( x \to -\infty \), \( 4^x \to 0^+ \) (approaches 0 but never reaches it).
  - As \( x \to +\infty \), \( 4^x \to +\infty \).

#### Inference 2: Behavior of the Function
- The function \( y = 4^x \) is strictly increasing for all \( x \).
- At \( x = 0 \), \( y = 4^0 = 1 \). This is the point where the graph intersects the \( y \)-axis.
- For \( x < 0 \), \( 4^x \) is a fraction between 0 and 1 (e.g., \( 4^{-1} = \frac{1}{4} \), \( 4^{-2} = \frac{1}{16} \)).
- For \( x > 0 \), \( 4^x \) is greater than 1 (e.g., \( 4^1 = 4 \), \( 4^2 = 16 \)).

#### Inference 3: Analyzing the Choices
- **Choice A**: "The \( y \)-value of most points of the graph is greater than 1."
  - While it is true that for \( x > 0 \), \( y = 4^x > 1 \), the statement does not account for the portion of the graph where \( x < 0 \) (where \( 0 < y < 1 \)). Therefore, this choice is incomplete.

- **Choice B**: "The \( y \)-value of every point on the graph is positive."
  - This is true because \( 4^x > 0 \) for all real \( x \). The graph never touches or goes below the \( x \)-axis.

- **Choice C**: "The \( y \)-value of every point on the graph is an integer."
  - This is false because \( 4^x \) is not restricted to integer values. For example, \( 4^{-0.5} = \frac{1}{2} \), which is not an integer.

- **Choice D**: "The \( y \)-value of most points on the graph is positive, and the \( y \)-value at one point is 0."
  - This is false because \( y = 4^x \) is never equal to 0 for any real \( x \). The graph approaches but never reaches the \( x \)-axis.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
Based on the deductions:
- The correct statement is that the \( y \)-value of every point on the graph is positive.
