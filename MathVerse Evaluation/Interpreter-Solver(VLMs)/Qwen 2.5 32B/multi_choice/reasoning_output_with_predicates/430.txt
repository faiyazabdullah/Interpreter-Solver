====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Elements:
1. **Points**:
   - Bus Stop: A point labeled "BUS STOP".
   - Playground: A point labeled "PLAYGROUND".
   - School: A point labeled "SCHOOL".

2. **Lines**:
   - Line connecting **Bus Stop** to **Playground**.
   - Line connecting **Playground** to **School**.
   - Line connecting **Bus Stop** directly to **School**.

3. **Shapes**:
   - Bus at the Bus Stop.
   - Playground area.
   - School building.

#### Predicates:
- **Point(BusStop)**, **Point(Playground)**, **Point(School)**: These establish the existence of these points.
- **Line(BusStop, Playground)**, **Line(Playground, School)**, **Line(BusStop, School)**: These establish the lines connecting the points.
- **PointLiesOnLine** predicates ensure that:
  - Bus Stop lies on the line between Bus Stop and Playground.
  - Bus Stop lies on the line between Bus Stop and School.
  - Playground lies on the line between Bus Stop and Playground.
  - Playground lies on the line between Playground and School.
  - School lies on the line between Playground and School.
  - School lies on the line between Bus Stop and School.

#### Question:
Sally needs to walk from the School to the Bus Stop. We need to determine if the quickest way to get there is through the Playground.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Key Observations:
1. **Direct Path**: There is a direct line connecting the **School** to the **Bus Stop** (Line(BusStop, School)).
2. **Indirect Path**: There is also a path via the **Playground**, which involves walking from the **School** to the **Playground** (Line(Playground, School)) and then from the **Playground** to the **Bus Stop** (Line(BusStop, Playground)).
3. **Geometric Principle**: The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. This is a fundamental geometric theorem.

#### Logical Steps:
1. **Step 1**: Identify the two possible paths:
   - **Path 1**: Directly from **School** to **Bus Stop** using Line(BusStop, School).
   - **Path 2**: Indirectly from **School** to **Playground** and then from **Playground** to **Bus Stop**, using Line(Playground, School) and Line(BusStop, Playground).

2. **Step 2**: Compare the lengths of the paths:
   - The direct path (Line(BusStop, School)) is a single straight line.
   - The indirect path consists of two segments: Line(Playground, School) and Line(BusStop, Playground). By the triangle inequality theorem, the sum of the lengths of these two segments must be greater than or equal to the length of the direct path. Since the indirect path includes an additional detour via the Playground, it is longer than the direct path.

3. **Step 3**: Conclude the shortest path:
   - The shortest path from the School to the Bus Stop is the direct line (Line(BusStop, School)).

#### Final Inference:
The quickest way to get from the School to the Bus Stop is **not** through the Playground. It is the direct path.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The statement "The quickest way to get there will be through the playground" is **False**.

Final Answer: A
