QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

Who is traveling faster?

CHOICES:
A:Justin
B:Oliver

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. **Axes**:
   - The x-axis represents **Time**.
   - The y-axis represents **Distance**.

2. **Linear Functions**:
   - There are two linear functions depicted in the graph:
     - A black line representing Oliver's progress.
     - A gray line representing Justin's progress.

3. **Points Marked**:
   - **Oliver**: The point labeled "Oliver" is at coordinates approximately \((5, 175)\).
   - **Justin**: The point labeled "Justin" is at coordinates approximately \((5, 125)\).

4. **Slopes**:
   - The black line (Oliver) has a steeper slope than the gray line (Justin). This suggests that Oliver is covering more distance per unit time compared to Justin.

#### Formal Predicates:
- `Point(Oliver)`
- `Point(Justin)`

#### Question:
We need to determine who is traveling faster. Since speed is defined as the rate of change of distance with respect to time (i.e., the slope of the distance-time graph), the person with the steeper slope is traveling faster.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Interpret the Slopes
- The slope of a line in a distance-time graph represents the speed of the object.
- From the graph:
  - The black line (Oliver) has a steeper slope.
  - The gray line (Justin) has a less steep slope.

#### Step 2.2: Compare Speeds Using Slope
- **Oliver's Speed**:
  - Oliver's line passes through the origin \((0, 0)\) and the point \((5, 175)\).
  - Slope \( m_{\text{Oliver}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{175 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \).
  - Therefore, Oliver's speed is 35 units of distance per unit of time.

- **Justin's Speed**:
  - Justin's line passes through the origin \((0, 0)\) and the point \((5, 125)\).
  - Slope \( m_{\text{Justin}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{125 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{125}{5} = 25 \).
  - Therefore, Justin's speed is 25 units of distance per unit of time.

#### Step 2.3: Conclusion from Slopes
- Since Oliver's slope (\(35\)) is greater than Justin's slope (\(25\)), Oliver is traveling faster.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the analysis, it is clear that Oliver is traveling faster because his slope (speed) is higher than Justin's.
