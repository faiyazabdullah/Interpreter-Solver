QUESTION:
The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What does this tell you?

CHOICES:
A:The cost of a call increases by $\$ 0.90$ for each additional minute
B:Each additional dollar will buy an additional 0.9 minutes of call time
C:The cost of a call decreases by $\$ 0.90$ for each additional minute
D:Each additional dollar will buy 0.9 minutes less of call time than the previous dollar

====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Analysis:
- The graph is a linear plot showing the relationship between **call length (minutes)** (x-axis) and **call cost (dollars)** (y-axis).
- Two points are clearly marked on the line:
  - Point 1: \( (10, 10) \): Call length = 10 minutes, Call cost = $10.
  - Point 2: \( (20, 19) \): Call length = 20 minutes, Call cost = $19.
- The line is straight, indicating a constant rate of increase in cost per unit increase in call length.

#### Predicates Analysis:
- **PointLiesOnLine(Point(10,10), Line(l))**: The point \( (10, 10) \) lies on the line \( l \).
- **PointLiesOnLine(Point(20,19), Line(l))**: The point \( (20, 19) \) lies on the line \( l \).
- **Perpendicular(Line(x_axis), Line(y_axis))**: The x-axis and y-axis are perpendicular, confirming the standard Cartesian coordinate system.
- The line \( l \) represents the relationship between call length and call cost.

#### Key Question:
We need to determine how the cost of a call changes with respect to call length. Specifically, we need to calculate the rate of change (slope) of the line.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Slope of the Line
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Using the points \( (10, 10) \) and \( (20, 19) \):
\[
m = \frac{19 - 10}{20 - 10} = \frac{9}{10} = 0.9
\]

#### Step 2.2: Interpret the Slope
The slope \( m = 0.9 \) represents the rate of change of the call cost with respect to call length. This means:
- For each additional minute of call duration, the cost increases by $0.90.

#### Step 2.3: Analyze the Choices
- **Choice A**: "The cost of a call increases by \$0.90 for each additional minute."
  - This directly matches our calculation of the slope.
- **Choice B**: "Each additional dollar will buy an additional 0.9 minutes of call time."
  - This is the inverse relationship, which is not what the slope represents.
- **Choice C**: "The cost of a call decreases by \$0.90 for each additional minute."
  - This contradicts the positive slope; the cost increases, not decreases.
- **Choice D**: "Each additional dollar will buy 0.9 minutes less of call time than the previous dollar."
  - This is also the inverse relationship and does not align with the slope.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The correct interpretation of the slope is that the cost increases by $0.90 for each additional minute of call duration. Therefore, the correct choice is:
