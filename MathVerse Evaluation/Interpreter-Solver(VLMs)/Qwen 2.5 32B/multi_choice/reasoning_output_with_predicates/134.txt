QUESTION:
As shown in the picture, Xiaoying designed a flashlight to measure the height of an ancient city wall. Place a horizontal plane mirror at point P. The light starts from point A and is reflected by the plane mirror and hits the top C of the ancient city wall CD. It is known that AB perpendicular  BD, CD perpendicular  BD. And it is measured that AB = 1.4, BP = 2.1, PD = 12.0. Then the height of the ancient city wall CD is ()

CHOICES:
A:6米
B:8米
C:10米
D:12米

====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and given predicates, we extract the following critical information:
1. **Geometric Configuration**:
   - $AB \perp BD$ and $CD \perp BD$, meaning both $AB$ and $CD$ are vertical segments.
   - A light ray travels from $A$, reflects off the plane mirror at $P$, and reaches $C$. This implies the angles of incidence and reflection are equal.
   - Triangles $\triangle ABP$ and $\triangle CDP$ are right triangles because $AB \perp BD$ and $CD \perp BD$.

2. **Key Measurements**:
   - $AB = 1.4$ meters.
   - $BP = 2.1$ meters.
   - $PD = 12.0$ meters.

3. **Special Relationships**:
   - The problem states that $\triangle ABP \sim \triangle CDP$ (similar triangles).
   - The similarity of triangles is justified by the fact that corresponding angles are equal due to the properties of reflection and the perpendicularity conditions.

4. **Goal**:
   - Determine the height of the ancient city wall, i.e., the length of $CD$.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Similarity of Triangles**
Since $\triangle ABP \sim \triangle CDP$, the corresponding sides of these triangles are proportional. Specifically:
\[
\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BP}{PD}
\]
This relationship follows from the similarity of triangles, which implies that the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.

#### **Step 2.2: Substitute Known Values**
We know:
- $AB = 1.4$
- $BP = 2.1$
- $PD = 12.0$

Substitute these values into the proportion:
\[
\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BP}{PD} \implies \frac{1.4}{CD} = \frac{2.1}{12.0}
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Solve for $CD$**
Cross-multiply to solve for $CD$:
\[
1.4 \cdot 12.0 = 2.1 \cdot CD \implies 16.8 = 2.1 \cdot CD
\]
Divide both sides by $2.1$:
\[
CD = \frac{16.8}{2.1} = 8
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The height of the ancient city wall $CD$ is $8$ meters. Therefore, the correct choice is:
