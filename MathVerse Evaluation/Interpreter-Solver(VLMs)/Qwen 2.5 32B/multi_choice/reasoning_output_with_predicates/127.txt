QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given image and predicates:
1. **Circle**: The circle has a radius of 1.0, denoted as \( \text{RadiusOf}(A) = 1.0 \).
2. **Sector**: The sector has a central angle of 120°, denoted as \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(B, O, C)) = 120.0^\circ \).
3. **Cone Formation**: The circle and the sector are used to form a cone model.
4. **Key Question**: We need to determine the radius of the sector.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Sector
The sector is part of a larger circle. The radius of the sector is the same as the radius of the larger circle from which it is cut. Let the radius of the sector be \( R \).

#### Step 2.2: Arc Length of the Sector
The arc length of the sector is the circumference of the base of the cone when the sector is formed into a cone. The formula for the arc length \( L \) of a sector with central angle \( \theta \) (in degrees) and radius \( R \) is:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi R
\]
Here, \( \theta = 120^\circ \) and the radius of the sector is \( R \). Thus, the arc length is:
\[
L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi R = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 2\pi R = \frac{2\pi R}{3}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Cone Base Circumference
When the sector is formed into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. The radius of the base of the cone is given as 1.0 (from the original circle). The circumference \( C \) of the base of the cone is:
\[
C = 2\pi \times 1 = 2\pi
\]
Since the arc length of the sector forms the circumference of the base of the cone, we equate the arc length to the circumference:
\[
\frac{2\pi R}{3} = 2\pi
\]

#### Step 2.4: Solving for \( R \)
Divide both sides of the equation by \( 2\pi \):
\[
\frac{R}{3} = 1
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
R = 3
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The radius of the sector is \( R = 3 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
