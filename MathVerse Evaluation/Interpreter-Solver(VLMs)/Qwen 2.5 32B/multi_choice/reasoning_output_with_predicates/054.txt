### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given image and predicates:
1. **Key Elements in the Image**:
   - A ruler and a triangular plate are placed such that they form specific angles.
   - Angle 1 is labeled as $40^\circ$.
   - There is a right triangle formed by the triangular plate, which indicates one of its angles is $90^\circ$.
   - Angle 2 is the unknown we need to determine.

2. **Given Predicates**:
   - `MeasureOf(Angle(1), 40.0)`: The measure of Angle 1 is $40^\circ$.
   - `Right(Triangle($1,$2,$3))`: One of the triangles in the diagram is a right triangle, meaning it contains a $90^\circ$ angle.

3. **Visual Observations**:
   - Angle 1 is formed between the ruler and one side of the triangular plate.
   - Angle 2 is the exterior angle adjacent to the right angle of the triangular plate and the ruler.

4. **Objective**: Determine the measure of Angle 2.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Identify Relationships Between Angles**
- From the image, Angle 1 ($40^\circ$) is part of a linear pair with another angle formed by the intersection of the ruler and the triangular plate. Let's call this angle $x$. Since these two angles form a linear pair, their sum must be $180^\circ$:
  $$
  \text{Angle 1} + x = 180^\circ
  $$
  Substituting the given value of Angle 1:
  $$
  40^\circ + x = 180^\circ \implies x = 140^\circ.
  $$

#### **Step 2.2: Use the Right Triangle Property**
- The triangular plate forms a right triangle, which means one of its internal angles is $90^\circ$. The right angle is adjacent to Angle 2.
- Angle 2 is an exterior angle relative to the right triangle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the measures of the two non-adjacent interior angles. In this case:
  - One of the non-adjacent interior angles is the $90^\circ$ right angle.
  - The other non-adjacent interior angle is $x = 140^\circ - 90^\circ = 50^\circ$ (the remaining acute angle in the right triangle).

#### **Step 2.3: Calculate Angle 2**
- Since Angle 2 is an exterior angle, it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of the right triangle:
  $$
  \text{Angle 2} = 90^\circ + 50^\circ = 140^\circ.
  $$

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of Angle 2 is $140^\circ$. Therefore, the correct choice is:
