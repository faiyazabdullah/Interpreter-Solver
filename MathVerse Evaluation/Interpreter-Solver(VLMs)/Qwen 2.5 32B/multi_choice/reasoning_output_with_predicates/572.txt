====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a quadratic function \( g(x) \) that opens downward.
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \( (-8, 8) \).
- The maximum value of \( g(x) \) occurs at the vertex, which is \( y = 8 \).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Function \( g(x) \)**:
   - Shape: Quadratic function.
   - Maximum value: The vertex is given as \( (-8, 8) \).
   - Therefore, the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is \( 8 \).

2. **Function \( f(x) \)**:
   - Defined as \( f(x) = -5(x + 4)^2 + 8 \).
   - This is also a quadratic function in vertex form, where the vertex is \( (-4, 8) \).
   - The coefficient of the squared term is negative, indicating that \( f(x) \) opens downward.
   - The maximum value of \( f(x) \) occurs at the vertex, which is \( y = 8 \).

#### Key Observations:
- Both functions \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) are quadratic functions that open downward.
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \( (-8, 8) \), and its maximum value is \( 8 \).
- The vertex of \( f(x) \) is at \( (-4, 8) \), and its maximum value is also \( 8 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Maximum Value of \( g(x) \)
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is given as \( (-8, 8) \).
- Since \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function opening downward, the maximum value occurs at the vertex.
- Therefore, the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is \( 8 \).

#### Step 2.2: Analyze the Maximum Value of \( f(x) \)
- The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( f(x) = -5(x + 4)^2 + 8 \).
- This is in vertex form \( f(x) = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where the vertex is \( (h, k) \).
- Here, \( h = -4 \) and \( k = 8 \), so the vertex is \( (-4, 8) \).
- Since \( f(x) \) is a quadratic function opening downward (the coefficient of \( (x + 4)^2 \) is negative), the maximum value occurs at the vertex.
- Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x) \) is \( 8 \).

#### Step 2.3: Compare the Maximum Values
- The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is \( 8 \).
- The maximum value of \( f(x) \) is also \( 8 \).
- Since both functions have the same maximum value, they share the same maximum.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Both \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) have the same maximum value of \( 8 \). Therefore, the correct choice is:
