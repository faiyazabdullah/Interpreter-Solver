====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The image shows a circle centered at the origin \( O \) with a radius of 1 unit.
- Three points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circumference of the circle.
- Point \( A \) is located in the first quadrant.
- Point \( B \) is located in the third quadrant.
- Point \( C \) is located in the fourth quadrant.

#### Predicates:
1. **Circle Properties:**
   - Circle \( O \) is centered at the origin \( O \).
   - Radius of the circle is 1 unit: \( OA = OB = OC = 1 \).

2. **Point Relationships:**
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on the circle.
   - The coordinates of these points can be represented as \( A(x_1, y_1) \), \( B(x_2, y_2) \), and \( C(x_3, y_3) \).

3. **Trigonometric Interpretation:**
   - For any point \( P(x, y) \) on the unit circle, the coordinates can be expressed as:
     \[
     x = \cos(\theta), \quad y = \sin(\theta)
     \]
     where \( \theta \) is the angle formed by the line segment \( OP \) and the positive \( x \)-axis.

4. **Angle Interpretation:**
   - The problem asks for \( \sin(310^\circ) \). We need to determine which coordinate corresponds to this value.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding \( \sin(310^\circ) \)
- The angle \( 310^\circ \) is in the fourth quadrant.
- In the fourth quadrant, the sine function is negative, and the cosine function is positive.
- Using the reference angle:
  \[
  310^\circ = 360^\circ - 50^\circ
  \]
  Thus, \( \sin(310^\circ) = -\sin(50^\circ) \).

#### Step 2.2: Identifying the Corresponding Point
- From the image, point \( C \) is located in the fourth quadrant.
- The coordinates of point \( C \) are \( (x_3, y_3) \).
- Since \( C \) is in the fourth quadrant, its \( x \)-coordinate is positive, and its \( y \)-coordinate is negative.
- By trigonometric definitions:
  \[
  x_3 = \cos(310^\circ), \quad y_3 = \sin(310^\circ)
  \]
  Therefore, the \( y \)-coordinate of point \( C \) is \( \sin(310^\circ) \).

#### Step 2.3: Matching with Choices
- Choice E: \( x \)-coordinate of point \( C \) → This is \( \cos(310^\circ) \), not \( \sin(310^\circ) \).
- Choice F: \( y \)-coordinate of point \( C \) → This is \( \sin(310^\circ) \).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The \( y \)-coordinate of point \( C \) is equal to \( \sin(310^\circ) \).
