QUESTION:
The logarithm function and a line are graphed. Logarithm function $f$ is graphed in blue and it goes through (30,4), (5,2), (55,5). Line $y=4$ is graphed in red and parallel to x-axis. A pharmaceutical scientist making a new medication wonders how much of the active ingredient to include in a dose. They are curious how long different amounts of the active ingredient will stay in someone's bloodstream.

The amount of time (in hours) the active ingredient remains in the bloodstream can be modeled by $f(x)=-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$, where $x$ is the initial amount of the active ingredient (in milligrams). Here is the graph of $f$ and the graph of the line $y=4$.

Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection point of the graphs?

Choose all answers that apply:

CHOICES:
A:It describes the amount of time the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream if the initial amount of the active ingredient is $4 \mathrm{mg}$.
B:
C:It gives the solution to the equation $-1.25 \cdot \ln \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=4$.
D:It describes the situation where the initial amount of the active ingredient is equal to how long it stays in the bloodstream.
E:
F:It gives the initial amount of the active ingredient such that the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The graph shows two functions:
  1. **Function \( f(x) = -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \)** (blue curve).
  2. **Line \( y = 4 \)** (red horizontal line).

- The blue curve intersects the red line at a point.
- Key points on the blue curve:
  - \( (5, 2) \)
  - \( (30, 4) \)
  - \( (55, 5) \)

- The red line \( y = 4 \) is parallel to the x-axis and intersects the blue curve at \( (30, 4) \).

#### Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(5,2),Line(f))**: The point \( (5, 2) \) lies on the blue curve \( f(x) \).
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(30,4),Line(f))**: The point \( (30, 4) \) lies on the blue curve \( f(x) \).
3. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(55,5),Line(f))**: The point \( (55, 5) \) lies on the blue curve \( f(x) \).
4. **Line(f)**: The blue curve is defined by \( f(x) = -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \).
5. **Line(y=4)**: The red line is defined by \( y = 4 \).
6. **Parallel(Line(y=4),Line(x-axis))**: The red line \( y = 4 \) is parallel to the x-axis.
7. **Perpendicular(Line(x-axis),Line(y-axis))**: The x-axis and y-axis are perpendicular.
8. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(30,4),Line(y=4))**: The point \( (30, 4) \) lies on the red line \( y = 4 \).
9. **Equals(y,4)**: The y-coordinate of the red line is always 4.
10. **Equals(f(x),-1.25 * ln(Div(1,x)))**: The blue curve is defined by the function \( f(x) = -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \).

#### Question:
We need to interpret the meaning of the intersection point of the graphs \( f(x) \) and \( y = 4 \). This intersection occurs at \( (30, 4) \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Intersection Point:
The intersection point of the graphs \( f(x) \) and \( y = 4 \) is \( (30, 4) \). This means:
1. At \( x = 30 \), the value of \( f(x) \) equals 4.
2. Mathematically, this satisfies the equation:
   \[
   f(30) = -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{30} \right) = 4
   \]

#### Interpretation of Choices:
We now analyze each statement in the choices to determine which ones are true based on the intersection point \( (30, 4) \).

##### Choice A:
"It describes the amount of time the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream if the initial amount of the active ingredient is \( 4 \mathrm{mg} \)."

- The intersection point \( (30, 4) \) means that when the initial amount of the active ingredient is \( 30 \mathrm{mg} \), the time it stays in the bloodstream is 4 hours.
- This does **not** describe the situation where the initial amount is \( 4 \mathrm{mg} \).
- **Choice A is incorrect.**

##### Choice B:
(This choice is missing in the problem statement. It appears to be incomplete. We will proceed with the given choices.)

##### Choice C:
"It gives the solution to the equation \( -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 4 \)."

- The intersection point \( (30, 4) \) means that \( f(30) = 4 \).
- Substituting \( x = 30 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
  \[
  f(30) = -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{30} \right) = 4
  \]
- Therefore, \( x = 30 \) is indeed the solution to the equation \( -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 4 \).
- **Choice C is correct.**

##### Choice D:
"It describes the situation where the initial amount of the active ingredient is equal to how long it stays in the bloodstream."

- The intersection point \( (30, 4) \) means that when the initial amount is \( 30 \mathrm{mg} \), the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream for 4 hours.
- However, this does not mean the initial amount is equal to the time it stays in the bloodstream.
- **Choice D is incorrect.**

##### Choice E:
(This choice is missing in the problem statement. It appears to be incomplete. We will proceed with the given choices.)

##### Choice F:
"It gives the initial amount of the active ingredient such that the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours."

- The intersection point \( (30, 4) \) means that when the initial amount is \( 30 \mathrm{mg} \), the active ingredient stays in the bloodstream for 4 hours.
- This directly implies that the initial amount \( x = 30 \mathrm{mg} \) results in the active ingredient lasting exactly 4 hours.
- **Choice F is correct.**

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The correct statements are:
- Choice C: It gives the solution to the equation \( -1.25 \cdot \ln \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = 4 \).
- Choice F: It gives the initial amount of the active ingredient such that the last of the active ingredient leaves the bloodstream after 4 hours.

Since the problem asks to select all applicable choices, the final answer is:

Final Answer: C, F

However, since the instruction specifies to provide exactly one final answer, and the problem format allows only one letter, we choose the most direct and mathematically precise interpretation:

Final Answer: C
