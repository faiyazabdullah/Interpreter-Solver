QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a parabola labeled \( y = g(x) \).
- The parabola opens upwards.
- It intersects the x-axis at points \( (-3, 0) \) and \( (4, 0) \).

#### From Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(-3,0), Line(x,0))**: The point \( (-3, 0) \) lies on the x-axis.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(4,0), Line(x,0))**: The point \( (4, 0) \) lies on the x-axis.
3. **Equals(g(x), (x+3)(x-4))**: The function \( g(x) \) is given as \( g(x) = (x + 3)(x - 4) \).
4. **Equals(f(x), Pow(x,2)+Mul(4,x))**: The function \( f(x) \) is given as \( f(x) = x^2 + 4x \).
5. **Equals(roots_f_x_0, 0)**: One root of \( f(x) \) is \( x = 0 \).
6. **Equals(roots_f_x_-4, -4)**: Another root of \( f(x) \) is \( x = -4 \).
7. **Equals(roots_g_x_-3, -3)**: One root of \( g(x) \) is \( x = -3 \).
8. **Equals(roots_g_x_4, 4)**: Another root of \( g(x) \) is \( x = 4 \).

#### Key Observations:
- The roots of \( g(x) \) are \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 4 \).
- The roots of \( f(x) \) are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -4 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze \( g(x) \)
From the predicate **Equals(g(x), (x+3)(x-4))**, we know:
\[ g(x) = (x + 3)(x - 4) \]
The roots of \( g(x) \) are found by setting \( g(x) = 0 \):
\[ (x + 3)(x - 4) = 0 \]
This gives:
\[ x = -3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4 \]

#### Step 2.2: Analyze \( f(x) \)
From the predicate **Equals(f(x), Pow(x,2)+Mul(4,x))**, we know:
\[ f(x) = x^2 + 4x \]
The roots of \( f(x) \) are found by setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ x^2 + 4x = 0 \]
Factorizing:
\[ x(x + 4) = 0 \]
This gives:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -4 \]

#### Step 2.3: Compare Roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \)
- Roots of \( f(x) \): \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -4 \).
- Roots of \( g(x) \): \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 4 \).

#### Step 2.4: Determine Common Roots
Compare the roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):
- Roots of \( f(x) \): \( 0, -4 \)
- Roots of \( g(x) \): \( -3, 4 \)

There are no common roots between \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Since \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) have no roots in common, the correct choice is:
\[ \text{Final Answer: C} \]
