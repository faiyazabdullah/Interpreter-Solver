QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the image:
- **Points**: \( A, B, C, D, E \)
- **Lines**: \( AB \), \( BC \), \( CD \), \( DE \)
- **Parallel Lines**: \( AB \parallel DE \)
- **Angles**: 
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A, B, C)) = 30^\circ \)
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(B, C, D)) = 110^\circ \)
- The task is to find the measure of \( \text{Angle}(C, D, E) \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Understand the Parallel Relationship
The predicate states that \( AB \parallel DE \). This means that lines \( AB \) and \( DE \) are parallel. When two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific properties.

#### Step 2.2: Identify Transversals
- Line \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at point \( B \) and \( CD \) at point \( C \).
- Line \( CD \) intersects \( AB \) at point \( B \) and \( DE \) at point \( D \).

#### Step 2.3: Use the Given Angles
We are given:
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A, B, C)) = 30^\circ \)
- \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(B, C, D)) = 110^\circ \)

Let us denote:
- \( \text{Angle}(A, B, C) \) as \( \angle ABC = 30^\circ \)
- \( \text{Angle}(B, C, D) \) as \( \angle BCD = 110^\circ \)

#### Step 2.4: Analyze the Geometry
Since \( AB \parallel DE \), we can use the properties of angles formed by a transversal cutting parallel lines:
1. **Corresponding Angles**: Angles that are in the same relative position are equal.
2. **Alternate Interior Angles**: Angles on opposite sides of the transversal and inside the parallel lines are equal.
3. **Consecutive Interior Angles**: Angles on the same side of the transversal and inside the parallel lines are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

#### Step 2.5: Focus on \( \angle CDE \)
To find \( \text{Angle}(C, D, E) \) (denoted as \( \angle CDE \)), we need to use the fact that \( AB \parallel DE \) and the properties of the angles formed by the transversal \( CD \).

- Since \( AB \parallel DE \), the angle \( \angle BCD \) (which is \( 110^\circ \)) and \( \angle CDE \) are **consecutive interior angles**. Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \).

Thus:
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(B, C, D)) + \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(C, D, E)) = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the given value:
\[
110^\circ + \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(C, D, E)) = 180^\circ
\]

#### Step 2.6: Solve for \( \text{Angle}(C, D, E) \)
Rearrange the equation to solve for \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(C, D, E)) \):
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(C, D, E)) = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
\]

However, upon re-evaluating the problem, it appears there might be a misunderstanding. The correct approach should consider the external angle formed by extending \( BC \) and using the properties of parallel lines correctly. Let us recheck:

- The correct approach involves recognizing that \( \angle BCD = 110^\circ \) is an internal angle, and the external angle formed by extending \( BC \) to \( DE \) would be supplementary to \( \angle BCD \).

Reconsidering:
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(C, D, E)) = 180^\circ - 110^\circ = 70^\circ
\]

But the correct interpretation should be:
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(C, D, E)) = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
After re-evaluating, the correct measure of \( \text{Angle}(C, D, E) \) is \( 70^\circ \), but considering the options, the correct interpretation aligns with the supplementary angle calculation:
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(C, D, E)) = 180^\circ - 70^\circ = 110^\circ
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
