QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the problem statement and the given predicates, we extract the following key information:
1. **Length of the candle**: \( \text{LengthOf(Line(A, B))} = 20.0 \).
2. **Length of the paper tube**: \( \text{LengthOf(Line(C))} = 15.0 \).
3. **Height of the image**: \( \text{LengthOf(image\_height)} = 4.0 \).
4. **Objective**: Determine the distance between the candle and the paper tube to achieve an image height of 4.0.

The setup describes a pinhole camera model, where the image formation follows the principle of similar triangles. The candle acts as the object, and the paper tube acts as the screen where the image is formed. The relationship between the object height, image height, object distance, and image distance is governed by the similarity of triangles.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Define Variables
- Let \( h_o \) be the height of the candle (object height): \( h_o = 20.0 \).
- Let \( h_i \) be the height of the image: \( h_i = 4.0 \).
- Let \( d_o \) be the distance from the candle to the pinhole (object distance).
- Let \( d_i \) be the distance from the pinhole to the paper tube (image distance): \( d_i = 15.0 \).

#### Step 2.2: Similar Triangles Relationship
In the pinhole camera model, the object and its image form similar triangles. The ratio of the image height to the object height is equal to the ratio of the image distance to the object distance:
\[
\frac{h_i}{h_o} = \frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{4.0}{20.0} = \frac{15.0}{d_o}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for \( d_o \)
First, simplify the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{4.0}{20.0} = 0.2
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
0.2 = \frac{15.0}{d_o}
\]
Rearrange to solve for \( d_o \):
\[
d_o = \frac{15.0}{0.2} = 75.0
\]

#### Step 2.4: Interpret the Result
The distance between the candle and the paper tube (i.e., the object distance \( d_o \)) is 75.0 cm.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The calculated distance between the candle and the paper tube is 75.0 cm. This matches choice D.
