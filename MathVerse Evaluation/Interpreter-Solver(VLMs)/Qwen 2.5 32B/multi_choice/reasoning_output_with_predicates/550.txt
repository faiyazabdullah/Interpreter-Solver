QUESTION:
Elena knows that Lea has a garden with an area of 100 square meters. She does not know the specific width, $w$, and length, $l$ of the garden. The graph below represents the widths that correspond to possible lengths of Lea's garden, which decreases when $w$ increases and goes through (5,20), (10,10), (20,5). As the possible width of Lea's garden increases, what does its possible length approach?

CHOICES:
A:$\infty$
B:$\hline 0$
C:$\hline 10$
D:$\hline 120$

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Visual and Predicate Information:
1. **Graph Analysis**:
   - The graph shows a relationship between the width \( w \) and the length \( l \) of a rectangle.
   - The graph is a hyperbolic curve, indicating that \( l \) decreases as \( w \) increases.
   - The curve passes through the points \((5, 20)\), \((10, 10)\), and \((20, 5)\).

2. **Formal Predicates**:
   - **PointLiesOnLine**: Points \((5, 20)\), \((10, 10)\), and \((20, 5)\) lie on the curve representing the relationship between \( l \) and \( w \).
   - **AreaOf**: The area of the garden is given as 100 square meters.
   - **LengthOf(l)** and **WidthOf(w)**: These represent the dimensions of the rectangle.
   - **Perpendicular(Line(l), Line(w))**: This implies that the length and width are perpendicular, confirming the rectangular shape.

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since the area of the garden is 100 square meters, the relationship between \( l \) and \( w \) is given by:
     \[
     l \cdot w = 100
     \]
   - As \( w \) increases, \( l \) decreases because their product must remain constant at 100.

#### What We Are Asked:
We need to determine what the possible length \( l \) approaches as the width \( w \) increases.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Relationship Between \( l \) and \( w \)
From the predicate \( l \cdot w = 100 \), we can express \( l \) in terms of \( w \):
\[
l = \frac{100}{w}
\]
This equation confirms that \( l \) is inversely proportional to \( w \). As \( w \) increases, \( l \) decreases.

#### Step 2.2: Behavior of \( l \) as \( w \) Increases
- When \( w \) is small, \( l \) is large. For example:
  - At \( w = 5 \), \( l = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \).
  - At \( w = 10 \), \( l = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \).
  - At \( w = 20 \), \( l = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \).
- As \( w \) continues to increase beyond these values, \( l \) decreases further. For instance:
  - At \( w = 50 \), \( l = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \).
  - At \( w = 100 \), \( l = \frac{100}{100} = 1 \).

#### Step 2.3: Limiting Behavior as \( w \to \infty \)
Mathematically, as \( w \) approaches infinity (\( w \to \infty \)):
\[
l = \frac{100}{w} \to 0
\]
This is because dividing a fixed number (100) by increasingly larger values of \( w \) results in \( l \) approaching 0.

#### Step 2.4: Visual Confirmation
The graph confirms this behavior:
- The curve approaches the horizontal axis (where \( l = 0 \)) as \( w \) increases.
- There is no lower bound for \( l \) other than 0, as the curve gets arbitrarily close to the horizontal axis but never reaches it.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the analysis, as the width \( w \) of Lea's garden increases, the possible length \( l \) approaches 0. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Final Answer: B
