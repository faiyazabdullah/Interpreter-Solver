QUESTION:
This graph shows the relationship between the current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms) in an electrical circuit, when the voltage provided to the circuit is 240 V. The equation could be described as \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}}=\text{Current}

What happens to the current as the resistance increases?

CHOICES:
A:The current increases.
B:The current decreases.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Graph:
- The graph shows a curve representing the relationship between current (in amperes) and resistance (in ohms).
- The equation provided is \( \text{Current} = \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}} \).
- As resistance increases, the curve moves downward, indicating a decrease in current.
- The x-axis represents resistance (ohms), and the y-axis represents current (amperes).

#### Predicates:
- **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(0,50))**: This indicates that the origin (0, 0) lies on a vertical line extending from 0 to 50 on the y-axis.
- **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(50,0))**: This indicates that the origin (0, 0) lies on a horizontal line extending from 0 to 50 on the x-axis.
- **Perpendicular(Line(0,50), Line(50,0))**: This confirms that the axes are perpendicular, forming a standard coordinate system.

#### Key Observations:
- The relationship between current and resistance is inversely proportional, as indicated by the equation \( \text{Current} = \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}} \).
- The graph visually confirms this inverse relationship, showing that as resistance increases, the current decreases.

#### Specific Question:
We need to determine what happens to the current as the resistance increases.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Inverse Relationship
From the equation \( \text{Current} = \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}} \):
- The current is inversely proportional to the resistance.
- This means that as resistance increases, the denominator of the fraction \( \frac{240}{\text{Resistance}} \) becomes larger.
- A larger denominator results in a smaller value for the current.

#### Step 2.2: Analyzing the Graph
- The graph shows a hyperbolic curve, which is characteristic of an inverse relationship.
- As we move along the x-axis (resistance) to the right (increasing resistance), the corresponding y-values (current) decrease.
- For example:
  - At low resistances (e.g., 5 ohms), the current is high (e.g., 48 amperes).
  - At higher resistances (e.g., 50 ohms), the current is much lower (e.g., 4.8 amperes).

#### Step 2.3: Mathematical Verification
Let us verify the trend mathematically:
- When resistance = 10 ohms:
  \[
  \text{Current} = \frac{240}{10} = 24 \text{ amperes}
  \]
- When resistance = 20 ohms:
  \[
  \text{Current} = \frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ amperes}
  \]
- When resistance = 40 ohms:
  \[
  \text{Current} = \frac{240}{40} = 6 \text{ amperes}
  \]

As resistance increases, the current decreases, confirming the inverse relationship.

#### Step 2.4: Connecting to the Predicates
- The predicates confirm that the coordinate system is properly defined with perpendicular axes.
- The graph's origin and axes align with the given predicates, ensuring the visual representation is accurate.
- The inverse relationship is consistent with both the equation and the graph.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the analysis:
- The current decreases as the resistance increases.
- This matches choice B: "The current decreases."

Final Answer: B
