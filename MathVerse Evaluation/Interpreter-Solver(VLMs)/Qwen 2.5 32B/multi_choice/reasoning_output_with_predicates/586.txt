QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### Visual Observations:
1. The graph shows a curve that passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).
2. As \(x\) increases, the value of \(y\) also increases, indicating that the function is strictly increasing.
3. The curve does not appear to intersect itself or form any loops.

#### Predicates Analysis:
- **Point(Origin)**: The origin \((0, 0)\) is identified as a point.
- **Line(xAxis)** and **Line(yAxis)**: These represent the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis, respectively.
- **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, xAxis)** and **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, yAxis)**: The origin lies on both the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis.
- **Perpendicular(xAxis, yAxis)**: The \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis are perpendicular to each other.

#### Question Focus:
We need to determine whether the given curve has an inverse function. For a function to have an inverse, it must pass the **Horizontal Line Test**: No horizontal line can intersect the graph at more than one point.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Function's Behavior:**
   - The curve is strictly increasing because as \(x\) increases, \(y\) increases. This implies that for any two different \(x\)-values, the corresponding \(y\)-values will also be different.

2. **Horizontal Line Test:**
   - From the graph, no horizontal line intersects the curve at more than one point. This is a direct consequence of the curve being strictly increasing.
   - If a function passes the Horizontal Line Test, it means the function is one-to-one, and thus it has an inverse.

3. **Formal Justification:**
   - Since the curve is strictly increasing, it satisfies the condition of being one-to-one.
   - By the definition of inverse functions, a one-to-one function has an inverse.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
Based on the observations and reasoning above, the curve satisfies the conditions for having an inverse function. Therefore, the answer is:
