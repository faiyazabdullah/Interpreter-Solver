QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Image:
- The graph shows a piecewise function \( h(x) \) that passes through specific points.
- The points listed are: \( (-5, 4) \), \( (-3, 3) \), \( (0, 7) \), \( (3, 1) \), and \( (5, -5) \).
- The function appears to consist of straight-line segments connecting these points.

#### Predicates Analysis:
- The given points are:
  - \( A = (-5, 4) \)
  - \( B = (-3, 3) \)
  - \( C = (0, 7) \)
  - \( D = (3, 1) \)
  - \( E = (5, -5) \)
- The lines connecting these points are:
  - Line \( AB \): Between \( A \) and \( B \)
  - Line \( BC \): Between \( B \) and \( C \)
  - Line \( CD \): Between \( C \) and \( D \)
  - Line \( DE \): Between \( D \) and \( E \)

#### Key Observations:
- The function \( h(x) \) is defined by connecting these points with straight-line segments.
- The domain of \( h(x) \) is the set of all \( x \)-coordinates for which the function is defined. From the image and predicates, the \( x \)-coordinates of the points are \( -5, -3, 0, 3, \) and \( 5 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

1. **Identify the \( x \)-coordinates of the given points:**
   - The \( x \)-coordinates are: \( -5, -3, 0, 3, 5 \).

2. **Determine the range of \( x \)-values covered by the function:**
   - The function starts at \( x = -5 \) and ends at \( x = 5 \).
   - Since the function is piecewise and connects these points with straight lines, it is defined for all \( x \)-values between \( -5 \) and \( 5 \), inclusive.

3. **Formalize the domain:**
   - The domain of \( h(x) \) is the interval \( [-5, 5] \), which means \( -5 \leq x \leq 5 \).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The domain of the function \( h(x) \) is \( -5 \leq x \leq 5 \). This matches choice C.

### Final Answer:
Final Answer: C
