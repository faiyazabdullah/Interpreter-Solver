QUESTION:
The graph shows the price change, in dollars, of a toy for different levels of demand. The x-axis represents quantity (thousand units), and the y-axis represents price.

What does the average rate of change tell you?

CHOICES:
A:An increase in demand of 500 units will decrease the price of each toy by $\$ 1$
B:An increase in demand of 500 units will increase the price of each toy by $\$ 1$
C:The price of each toy increases by $\$ 0.50$ for each additional 1000 units demanded
D:The price of each toy decreases by $\$ 0.50$ for each additional 1000 units demanded

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Image:
- The graph shows a straight line representing the relationship between the price of a toy (y-axis) and the quantity demanded (x-axis).
- Key points on the line:
  - At \( x = 6 \), \( y = 17 \).
  - At \( x = 16 \), \( y = 22 \).

#### Predicates:
1. **Point(A)** and **Point(B)** represent two points on the line.
2. **Line(A,B)** is the straight line connecting these points.
3. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(6,17), Line(A,B))**: The point \((6, 17)\) lies on the line.
4. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(16,22), Line(A,B))**: The point \((16, 22)\) lies on the line.

#### Question:
The problem asks us to interpret the **average rate of change** of the price with respect to the quantity demanded. This corresponds to the slope of the line in the graph.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Slope of the Line
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
From the graph and predicates, the points are:
- \( (x_1, y_1) = (6, 17) \)
- \( (x_2, y_2) = (16, 22) \)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
m = \frac{22 - 17}{16 - 6} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
\]

#### Step 2.2: Interpret the Slope
The slope \( m = 0.5 \) indicates the **rate of change** of the price with respect to the quantity demanded. Specifically:
- For every unit increase in \( x \) (quantity demanded in thousand units), the price \( y \) increases by \( 0.5 \) dollars.
- Since the x-axis represents quantity in **thousand units**, an increase of 1 on the x-axis corresponds to an increase of 1000 units.

Thus, the price increases by $0.50 for each additional 1000 units demanded.

#### Step 2.3: Match the Result with the Choices
The slope \( m = 0.5 \) directly corresponds to the following interpretation:
- The price of each toy increases by $0.50 for each additional 1000 units demanded.

This matches **Choice C**.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The average rate of change tells us that the price of each toy increases by $0.50 for each additional 1000 units demanded.

Final Answer: C
