QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### From the Image and Predicates:
1. **Triangle ABC** is a right triangle with:
   - \( \angle ACB = 90^\circ \) (RightAngle predicate).
   - \( AC = 4.0 \) (LengthOf predicate for Line(A,C)).
   - \( BC = 3.0 \) (LengthOf predicate for Line(B,C)).
   - \( AB \) is the hypotenuse (IsHypotenuseOf predicate).

2. **Key Relationships**:
   - \( AC \perp BC \) (Perpendicular predicate).
   - \( AC \) is one leg of the right triangle, and \( BC \) is the other leg.
   - Rotating the triangle around the line \( AC \) forms a solid of revolution.

3. **Objective**:
   - Find the **lateral surface area** of the rotating body formed by revolving the triangle around \( AC \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Shape Formed by Rotation
- When triangle \( ABC \) is rotated around the line \( AC \):
  - Point \( A \) remains fixed because it lies on the axis of rotation.
  - Point \( C \) also remains fixed.
  - Point \( B \) traces a circular path around \( AC \), forming a cone.
  - The base of the cone is a circle with radius equal to \( BC = 3.0 \).
  - The slant height of the cone is the hypotenuse \( AB \).

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Hypotenuse \( AB \)
- By the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABC \):
  \[
  AB = \sqrt{AC^2 + BC^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5.
  \]
  Therefore, the slant height of the cone is \( AB = 5.0 \).

#### Step 2.3: Determine the Lateral Surface Area of the Cone
- The formula for the lateral surface area of a cone is:
  \[
  \text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi \cdot r \cdot l,
  \]
  where:
  - \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone.
  - \( l \) is the slant height of the cone.
- Here:
  - The radius \( r = BC = 3.0 \).
  - The slant height \( l = AB = 5.0 \).
- Substituting these values into the formula:
  \[
  \text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi \cdot 3 \cdot 5 = 15\pi.
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The lateral surface area of the rotating body is \( 15\pi \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
