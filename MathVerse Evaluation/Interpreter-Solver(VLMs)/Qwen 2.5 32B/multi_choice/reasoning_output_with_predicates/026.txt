QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, in order to measure the height of the school flagpole, Xiaodong uses a bamboo pole with a length of 3.2 as a measuring tool, and moves the bamboo pole so that the top of the bamboo pole and the shadow of the top of the flag pole fall on the same point on the ground. At this time, the distance between the bamboo pole and this point is 8.0 , 22.0 from the flagpole, the height of the flagpole is ().

CHOICES:
A:8.8
B:10
C:12
D:14

====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The figure depicts two similar right triangles formed by the shadows of the bamboo pole and the flagpole.
- The bamboo pole casts a shadow that aligns with the shadow of the flagpole at a common endpoint.
- Key distances are marked:
  - The height of the bamboo pole ($BC$) is 3.2 meters.
  - The distance from the base of the bamboo pole to the shadow endpoint ($AB$) is 8 meters.
  - The distance from the base of the flagpole to the shadow endpoint ($AE$) is 22 meters.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ are defined.
   - Line segments $AC$, $BC$, and $DE$ are drawn.
   - $B$ lies on line $AC$.
   - $BC$ is perpendicular to $AC$.
   - $DE$ is perpendicular to $AC$.

2. **Measurements**:
   - $LengthOf(B,C) = 3.2$ (height of the bamboo pole).
   - $LengthOf(A,B) = 8$ (distance from the base of the bamboo pole to the shadow endpoint).
   - $LengthOf(A,E) = 22$ (distance from the base of the flagpole to the shadow endpoint).

3. **Similar Triangles**:
   - Triangles $ABC$ and $ADE$ are similar ($Similar(Triangle(A,B,C), Triangle(A,D,E))$).

#### What We Need to Find:
- The height of the flagpole, represented by $DE$.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understand the Similarity of Triangles
From the predicates, we know that triangles $ABC$ and $ADE$ are similar. By the properties of similar triangles, corresponding sides are proportional. Therefore:
$$
\frac{BC}{DE} = \frac{AB}{AE}
$$

#### Step 2.2: Substitute Known Values
- $BC = 3.2$ (height of the bamboo pole).
- $AB = 8$ (distance from the base of the bamboo pole to the shadow endpoint).
- $AE = 22$ (distance from the base of the flagpole to the shadow endpoint).
- Let $DE = h$ (height of the flagpole, which we need to find).

Substitute these values into the proportion:
$$
\frac{3.2}{h} = \frac{8}{22}
$$

#### Step 2.3: Solve for $h$
Cross-multiply to solve for $h$:
$$
3.2 \cdot 22 = 8 \cdot h
$$
$$
70.4 = 8h
$$
$$
h = \frac{70.4}{8} = 8.8
$$

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The height of the flagpole is $8.8$ meters. Comparing this with the given choices:
- A: 8.8
- B: 10
- C: 12
- D: 14

The correct answer is:
$$
\boxed{A}
$$

Final Answer: A
