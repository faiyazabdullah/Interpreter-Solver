### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the geometric figure:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Points: $P$, $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$.
   - Lines: $AB$, $CD$, $PC$, $PD$.
   - $A$ lies on line $PC$, and $B$ lies on line $PD$.

2. **Key Relationships**:
   - $AB \parallel CD$: Lines $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel.
   - Lengths: $AB = 2.0$, $CD = 5.0$.
   - Altitude: The distance from $P$ to $CD$ is $3.0$.
   - Similarity: Triangles $\triangle PAB$ and $\triangle PCD$ are similar.

3. **Objective**: Find the distance between lines $AB$ and $CD$.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Analyze Similar Triangles
Since $\triangle PAB \sim \triangle PCD$, the corresponding sides are proportional. The ratio of similarity is given by the ratio of the lengths of corresponding sides:
$$
\frac{\text{Length of } AB}{\text{Length of } CD} = \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{2}{5}.
$$
This implies that the height of $\triangle PAB$ relative to the height of $\triangle PCD$ is also in the same ratio.

#### Step 2.2: Define Heights and Distances
Let:
- $h_1$ be the altitude of $\triangle PAB$ (the distance from $P$ to line $AB$).
- $h_2$ be the altitude of $\triangle PCD$ (the distance from $P$ to line $CD$).

From the problem, we know:
$$
h_2 = 3.0.
$$
Using the similarity ratio:
$$
\frac{h_1}{h_2} = \frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{2}{5}.
$$
Substitute $h_2 = 3.0$:
$$
\frac{h_1}{3} = \frac{2}{5} \implies h_1 = \frac{2}{5} \cdot 3 = \frac{6}{5}.
$$

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Distance Between $AB$ and $CD$
The total distance from $P$ to $CD$ is $h_2 = 3.0$. The distance from $P$ to $AB$ is $h_1 = \frac{6}{5}$. The distance between $AB$ and $CD$ is the difference between these two heights:
$$
\text{Distance between } AB \text{ and } CD = h_2 - h_1 = 3.0 - \frac{6}{5}.
$$
Convert $3.0$ to a fraction:
$$
3.0 = \frac{15}{5}.
$$
Thus:
$$
\text{Distance between } AB \text{ and } CD = \frac{15}{5} - \frac{6}{5} = \frac{9}{5}.
$$

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The distance between $AB$ and $CD$ is $\frac{9}{5}$. Therefore, the correct choice is:
$$
\boxed{C}
$$
