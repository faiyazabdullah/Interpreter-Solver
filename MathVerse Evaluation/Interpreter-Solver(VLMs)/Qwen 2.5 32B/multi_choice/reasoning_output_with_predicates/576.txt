QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a polynomial function \( p(x) \) that crosses the \( x \)-axis at three points: \( (-5, 0) \), \( (-1.5, 0) \), and \( (2, 0) \).
- These points are roots of the polynomial function \( p(x) \).

#### From the Predicates:
- The predicates confirm that the points \( (-5, 0) \), \( (-1.5, 0) \), and \( (2, 0) \) lie on the line \( y = 0 \), meaning they are roots of the polynomial.

#### Key Observations:
- Since the polynomial passes through these points, the polynomial must have factors corresponding to these roots:
  - \( x + 5 \) (for the root \( x = -5 \))
  - \( x + 1.5 \) (for the root \( x = -1.5 \))
  - \( x - 2 \) (for the root \( x = 2 \))

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: General Form of the Polynomial
- A polynomial with roots at \( x = -5 \), \( x = -1.5 \), and \( x = 2 \) can be written in factored form as:
  \[
  p(x) = k(x + 5)(x + 1.5)(x - 2)
  \]
  where \( k \) is a constant.

#### Step 2.2: Simplify the Factor \( x + 1.5 \)
- To simplify the factor \( x + 1.5 \), rewrite it as:
  \[
  x + 1.5 = x + \frac{3}{2} = \frac{2x + 3}{2}
  \]
- Therefore, the polynomial becomes:
  \[
  p(x) = k \left( x + 5 \right) \left( \frac{2x + 3}{2} \right) (x - 2)
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Match with the Given Choices
- We need to compare this form with the given choices. Letâ€™s analyze each option:

  **Choice A:**
  \[
  p(x) = (x + 5)(2x + 3)(x - 2)
  \]
  - This matches our derived form if \( k = 1 \).

  **Choice B:**
  \[
  p(x) = (x - 5)(2x - 3)(x + 2)
  \]
  - The roots here are \( x = 5 \), \( x = \frac{3}{2} \), and \( x = -2 \), which do not match the given roots.

  **Choice C:**
  \[
  p(x) = (-5x)\left(-\frac{3}{2}x\right)(2x)
  \]
  - This represents a cubic polynomial, but it does not have the correct roots \( x = -5 \), \( x = -1.5 \), and \( x = 2 \).

  **Choice D:**
  \[
  p(x) = (5x)\left(\frac{3}{2}x\right)(-2x)
  \]
  - This also represents a cubic polynomial but does not have the correct roots.

#### Step 2.4: Verify Choice A
- Choice A matches the general form \( p(x) = k(x + 5)(2x + 3)(x - 2) \) with \( k = 1 \). The roots are correctly \( x = -5 \), \( x = -1.5 \), and \( x = 2 \).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The polynomial \( p(x) \) that satisfies the given conditions is:
\[
p(x) = (x + 5)(2x + 3)(x - 2)
\]

Thus, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]
