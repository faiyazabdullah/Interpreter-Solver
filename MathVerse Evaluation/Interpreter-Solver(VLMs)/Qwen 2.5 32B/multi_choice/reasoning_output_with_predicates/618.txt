### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Analysis:
- The graph depicts an exponential function, as indicated by its rapid increase and characteristic curve.
- The points given are: \((0, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((3, 8)\).
- These points suggest the relationship \( y = 2^x \).

#### Predicate Analysis:
- The predicates confirm that the points \((0, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((3, 8)\) lie on the graph.
- The relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) is consistent with an exponential function of the form \( y = 2^x \).

#### Key Observations:
- The function \( y = 2^x \) is consistent with the given points.
- The problem requires identifying which real-world scenario matches this exponential growth pattern.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Option A: The number of people \( y \) attending a parent/teacher conference when there are \( x \) parents, each bringing 2 children.
- If each parent brings 2 children, the total number of attendees is given by:
  \[
  y = x + 2x = 3x
  \]
- This is a linear relationship (\( y = 3x \)), not an exponential one.
- **Conclusion**: Option A does not match the exponential function \( y = 2^x \).

#### Option B: The number of layers \( y \) resulting from a rectangular piece of paper being folded in half \( x \) times.
- When a piece of paper is folded once, it doubles its layers.
- After \( x \) folds, the number of layers is:
  \[
  y = 2^x
  \]
- This matches the exponential function \( y = 2^x \) exactly.
- **Conclusion**: Option B matches the exponential function \( y = 2^x \).

#### Option C: The number of handshakes \( y \) made by \( x \) people in a room if every person shakes hands with every other person.
- The number of handshakes among \( x \) people is given by the combination formula:
  \[
  y = \binom{x}{2} = \frac{x(x-1)}{2}
  \]
- This is a quadratic relationship, not an exponential one.
- **Conclusion**: Option C does not match the exponential function \( y = 2^x \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the analysis:
- Option A represents a linear relationship (\( y = 3x \)).
- Option B represents an exponential relationship (\( y = 2^x \)).
- Option C represents a quadratic relationship (\( y = \frac{x(x-1)}{2} \)).

The given graph corresponds to the exponential function \( y = 2^x \), which matches the scenario described in Option B.

---
