QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and given predicates, we can extract the following key information:
1. **Triangle \( RST \)**: The geometric figure is a triangle with vertices \( R \), \( S \), and \( T \).
2. **Angle \( \angle SRT \)**: The measure of \( \angle SRT \) is given as 70 degrees.
3. **Isosceles Triangle**: The triangle \( RST \) is isosceles, which means two sides are equal. Specifically, \( RS = RT \).
4. **Equal Angles**: Since \( RST \) is isosceles with \( RS = RT \), the base angles \( \angle RST \) and \( \angle RTS \) are equal.
5. **Goal**: We need to find the measure of \( \angle RST \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Use the Isosceles Triangle Property
By the definition of an isosceles triangle, if two sides are equal, then the angles opposite those sides are also equal. Here, since \( RS = RT \), it follows that:
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle RST) = \text{MeasureOf}(\angle RTS)
\]
Let \( x \) represent the measure of \( \angle RST \) and \( \angle RTS \). Therefore:
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle RST) = x \quad \text{and} \quad \text{MeasureOf}(\angle RTS) = x
\]

#### Step 2.2: Sum of Angles in a Triangle
The sum of the interior angles in any triangle is always 180 degrees. For triangle \( RST \):
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle SRT) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle RST) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle RTS) = 180^\circ
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
70^\circ + x + x = 180^\circ
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
70^\circ + 2x = 180^\circ
\]
Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[
2x = 110^\circ
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
x = 55^\circ
\]

#### Step 2.3: Verify the Solution
We have determined that \( \text{MeasureOf}(\angle RST) = 55^\circ \). To verify, check the sum of the angles:
\[
\text{MeasureOf}(\angle SRT) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle RST) + \text{MeasureOf}(\angle RTS) = 70^\circ + 55^\circ + 55^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
The sum is correct, confirming our solution.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of \( \angle RST \) is \( 55^\circ \). Therefore, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{A}
\]

Final Answer: A
