QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image and Predicates:
1. **Lines and Points**:
   - Line \(a\), Line \(b\), and Line \(c\) are present.
   - Point \(A\) is the intersection of Line \(b\) and Line \(c\).
   - Point \(A\) lies on both Line \(b\) and Line \(c\).

2. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - Line \(b\) is perpendicular to Line \(c\): \( \text{Perpendicular}(Line(b), Line(c)) \).
   - The measure of Angle 1 is given as \(70^\circ\): \( \text{Equals}(\text{MeasureOf}(Angle(1)), 70.0) \).
   - Line \(b\) is parallel to Line \(a\).

3. **Key Goal**:
   - Determine how much Line \(b\) can be rotated clockwise around Point \(A\) so that it remains parallel to Line \(a\).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Perpendicular Relationship
- Since Line \(b\) is perpendicular to Line \(c\), the angle between Line \(b\) and Line \(c\) is \(90^\circ\).
- This means that at Point \(A\), the angle formed by Line \(b\) and Line \(c\) is a right angle.

#### Step 2.2: Interpret Angle 1
- Angle 1 is labeled as \(70^\circ\) in the image.
- Since Line \(b\) is perpendicular to Line \(c\), the angle between Line \(b\) and Line \(c\) is \(90^\circ\). However, Angle 1 is an adjacent angle to the right angle formed by Line \(b\) and Line \(c\).
- Therefore, Angle 1 is part of a larger configuration involving Line \(a\) and Line \(c\).

#### Step 2.3: Use Parallelism Between Line \(a\) and Line \(b\)
- Line \(b\) is parallel to Line \(a\). This implies that the corresponding angles formed by the transversal Line \(c\) are equal.
- Specifically, the angle between Line \(a\) and Line \(c\) at the point of intersection is also \(70^\circ\) (corresponding to Angle 1).

#### Step 2.4: Determine the Rotation Required
- Currently, Line \(b\) forms a \(90^\circ\) angle with Line \(c\).
- To make Line \(b\) parallel to Line \(a\), it must align such that the angle between Line \(b\) and Line \(c\) matches the angle between Line \(a\) and Line \(c\), which is \(70^\circ\).
- The difference between the current angle (\(90^\circ\)) and the desired angle (\(70^\circ\)) is:
  \[
  90^\circ - 70^\circ = 20^\circ
  \]
- Therefore, Line \(b\) needs to be rotated **clockwise** by \(20^\circ\) around Point \(A\) to become parallel to Line \(a\).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The required rotation of Line \(b\) around Point \(A\) is \(20^\circ\) clockwise. This matches Choice D.
