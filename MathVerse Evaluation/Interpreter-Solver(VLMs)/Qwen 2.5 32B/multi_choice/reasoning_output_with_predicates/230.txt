QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the image:
1. **Points and Circle**: Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circle with center \( E \).
2. **Chords**: \( AC \) and \( BD \) are chords of the circle.
3. **Intersection**: Chords \( AC \) and \( BD \) intersect at point 2.
4. **Arc Measures**:
   - \( \text{Measure of } \widehat{BC} = 30^\circ \)
   - \( \text{Measure of } \widehat{AD} = 20^\circ \)
5. **Angles**:
   - \( \angle 1 = 30^\circ \)
   - \( \angle 2 \) is the angle we need to find.
6. **Key Relationships**: The problem involves the relationship between the intercepted arcs and the angles formed by the intersecting chords.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Understand the Geometry of Intersecting Chords
When two chords intersect inside a circle, the measure of the angle formed is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle. Specifically:
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( \text{Measure of } \widehat{AD} + \text{Measure of } \widehat{BC} \right)
\]
This result comes from the **Intersecting Chords Theorem**, which states that the measure of an angle formed by two intersecting chords is half the sum of the measures of the arcs intercepted by the angle and its vertical angle.

#### Step 2.2: Substitute Known Values
From the problem, we know:
- \( \text{Measure of } \widehat{AD} = 20^\circ \)
- \( \text{Measure of } \widehat{BC} = 30^\circ \)

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 20^\circ + 30^\circ \right)
\]

#### Step 2.3: Perform the Calculation
\[
\text{Measure of } \angle 2 = \frac{1}{2} \left( 50^\circ \right) = 25^\circ
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of \( \angle 2 \) is \( 25^\circ \). Therefore, the correct choice is:
\[
\text{Final Answer: B}
\]

Final Answer: B
