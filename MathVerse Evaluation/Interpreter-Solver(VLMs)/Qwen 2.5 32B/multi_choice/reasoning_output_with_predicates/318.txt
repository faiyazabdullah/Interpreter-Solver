QUESTION:
The figure shows three parallel horizontal lines, with a diagonal line running through them on the left and a vertical line on the right. The diagonal line on the left intersects with three horizontal lines, with a length of 2x+6 for the lower section and 20-5x for the upper section. The vertical line on the right intersects with three horizontal lines, with a length of y for the upper section and 3/5y+2 for the lower section. The two short line segments cut by the left line are of equal length, and the two short line segments cut by the right line are of equal lengthFind y.

A:3
B:4.5
C:5
D:6

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and the given predicates, we can extract the following key points:
1. **Geometric Setup**:
   - There are three parallel horizontal lines labeled as \( \text{Line}(l_1) \), \( \text{Line}(l_2) \), and \( \text{Line}(l_3) \).
   - A diagonal line intersects these horizontal lines, creating segments of lengths \( 20 - 5x \) and \( 2x + 6 \).
   - A vertical line intersects these horizontal lines, creating segments of lengths \( y \) and \( \frac{3}{5}y + 2 \).

2. **Key Relationships**:
   - The segments cut by the diagonal line are equal in length: \( 20 - 5x = 2x + 6 \).
   - The segments cut by the vertical line are also equal in length: \( y = \frac{3}{5}y + 2 \).

3. **Objective**:
   - Solve for \( y \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Solve for \( x \) using the diagonal line segments**
The problem states that the segments cut by the diagonal line are equal:
\[ 20 - 5x = 2x + 6. \]

**Solve for \( x \)**:
\[
20 - 5x = 2x + 6
\]
Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
\[
20 - 7x = 6
\]
Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
14 = 7x
\]
Divide by 7:
\[
x = 2.
\]

#### **Step 2.2: Solve for \( y \) using the vertical line segments**
The problem states that the segments cut by the vertical line are equal:
\[ y = \frac{3}{5}y + 2. \]

**Solve for \( y \)**:
\[
y = \frac{3}{5}y + 2
\]
Subtract \( \frac{3}{5}y \) from both sides:
\[
y - \frac{3}{5}y = 2
\]
Combine terms on the left-hand side:
\[
\frac{5}{5}y - \frac{3}{5}y = 2
\]
\[
\frac{2}{5}y = 2
\]
Multiply both sides by 5:
\[
2y = 10
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
y = 5.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
From the calculations, we have determined that \( y = 5 \). This matches choice C.

Final Answer: C
