QUESTION:
Piecewise functions $f$ and $g$ can model the heights (in meters) of two airplanes. $g$ is purple and goes through (0,10000), (40,9000), (80,9000), (100,11000), (130,11000), and $f$ is blue and goes through (10,11000), (50,11000), (60,10000), (100,10000), (120,0). $t$ is the number of minutes that have passed since noon at a local airport. Which statements represent the meaning of the intersection points of the graphs?

CHOICES:
A.They mean that one airplane was initially higher than the other airplane.
B.They mean that the airplanes reached the same height when they were both at 10,000 meters.
C.They give the solutions to the equation $f(t)=0$.
D.They give the solutions to the equation $f(t)=g(t)$.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

#### **From the Image:**
- The graph shows two piecewise functions:
  - Function \( f \): Represented by the blue line.
  - Function \( g \): Represented by the purple line.
- Key points on the graph:
  - Function \( f \):
    - Starts at (10, 11000).
    - Remains constant until (50, 11000).
    - Drops to (60, 10000) and remains constant until (100, 10000).
    - Plummets to (120, 0).
  - Function \( g \):
    - Starts at (0, 10000).
    - Drops to (40, 9000) and remains constant until (80, 9000).
    - Rises to (100, 11000) and remains constant until (130, 11000).
- Intersection point: The blue and purple lines intersect at a specific point.

#### **From Predicates:**
- **Points and Lines:**
  - Points \( A, B, C, D, E \) lie on \( f \).
  - Points \( F, G, H, I, J, K, L \) lie on \( g \).
  - Line segments \( AB, BC, CD, JK, KL \) are sides of \( f \).
  - Line segments \( EF, FG, GH \) are sides of \( g \).
  - The intersection point \( M \) lies on both \( f \) and \( g \).

- **Key Coordinates:**
  - \( A = (0, 0) \)
  - \( B = (10, 11000) \)
  - \( C = (50, 11000) \)
  - \( D = (60, 10000) \)
  - \( E = (100, 10000) \)
  - \( F = (120, 0) \)
  - \( G = (0, 10000) \)
  - \( H = (40, 9000) \)
  - \( I = (80, 9000) \)
  - \( J = (100, 11000) \)
  - \( K = (130, 11000) \)

- **Intersection:**
  - The point \( M \) is where \( f \) and \( g \) intersect. This is explicitly stated in the predicates.

#### **Question Focus:**
The question asks about the meaning of the intersection points of the graphs \( f \) and \( g \). Specifically, we need to interpret what these intersection points represent in the context of the problem.

---

### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

#### **1. Interpretation of Intersection Points:**
- The intersection point \( M \) occurs where the two functions \( f \) and \( g \) have the same value. Mathematically, this means:
  \[
  f(t) = g(t)
  \]
  at the coordinates of the intersection point.

#### **2. Relating to the Problem Context:**
- The functions \( f \) and \( g \) model the heights of two airplanes over time \( t \).
- At the intersection point, the heights of the two airplanes are equal. This is because the vertical axis represents height (in meters), and the horizontal axis represents time (in minutes).

#### **3. Evaluating the Choices:**
- **Choice A: "They mean that one airplane was initially higher than the other airplane."**
  - This is not necessarily true. The initial heights of the airplanes are given by the starting points of the functions, but the intersection point does not provide information about which airplane was initially higher. It only indicates where their heights became equal.
  - **Eliminate Choice A.**

- **Choice B: "They mean that the airplanes reached the same height when they were both at 10,000 meters."**
  - While it is true that the intersection point indicates the airplanes reached the same height, there is no guarantee that this height is specifically 10,000 meters. The actual height depends on the coordinates of the intersection point.
  - **Eliminate Choice B.**

- **Choice C: "They give the solutions to the equation \( f(t) = 0 \)."**
  - The intersection point involves the equation \( f(t) = g(t) \), not \( f(t) = 0 \). The intersection point does not necessarily correspond to when \( f(t) = 0 \); it corresponds to when \( f(t) = g(t) \).
  - **Eliminate Choice C.**

- **Choice D: "They give the solutions to the equation \( f(t) = g(t) \)."**
  - This is correct. The intersection points of the graphs \( f \) and \( g \) occur precisely when the heights of the two airplanes are equal, i.e., when \( f(t) = g(t) \).

#### **4. Conclusion from Deduction:**
The intersection points of the graphs represent the solutions to the equation \( f(t) = g(t) \).

---

### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The correct interpretation of the intersection points is given by Choice D.

**Final Answer: D**
