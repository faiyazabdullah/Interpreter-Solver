====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given image and predicates:
1. The figure is a parallelogram.
2. One side of the parallelogram has a length of 13 yd.
3. An adjacent side of the parallelogram has a length of 10 yd.
4. The angle between these two sides is 45°.
5. There is a right angle marked, indicating a perpendicular from one vertex to the opposite side, forming a height.

The task is to find the area of the parallelogram. The formula for the area of a parallelogram is:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
We will use the given side lengths and angle to calculate the height.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Identify the base and height**
- The base of the parallelogram can be taken as the side of length 13 yd.
- To find the height, we use the right triangle formed by dropping a perpendicular from one vertex to the opposite side. The height is the side opposite the 45° angle in this right triangle.

#### **Step 2.2: Calculate the height using trigonometry**
The height \( h \) can be found using the sine function in the right triangle:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, the hypotenuse is the side of length 10 yd, and the angle \( \theta \) is 45°. Thus:
\[
\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{h}{10}
\]
We know that:
\[
\sin(45^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
So:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{h}{10}
\]
Solving for \( h \):
\[
h = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 10 \cdot 0.7071 \approx 7.071 \, \text{yd}
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Calculate the area of the parallelogram**
Using the formula for the area of a parallelogram:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is 13 yd and the height is approximately 7.071 yd:
\[
\text{Area} = 13 \times 7.071 \approx 91.923 \, \text{yd}^2
\]
Rounding to the nearest tenth:
\[
\text{Area} \approx 91.9 \, \text{yd}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The calculated area of the parallelogram is approximately 91.9 square yards. Therefore, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{B}
\]
