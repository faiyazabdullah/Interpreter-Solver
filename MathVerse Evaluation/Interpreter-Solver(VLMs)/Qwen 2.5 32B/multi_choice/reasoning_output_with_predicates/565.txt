QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a quadratic function \( y = g(x) \).
- The function passes through the points:
  - \( (-2, 4) \)
  - \( (-1, 0) \)
  - \( (0, -2) \)
  - \( (2, 0) \)
  - \( (3, 4) \)

#### From Predicates:
- The points \( A, B, C, D, E \) lie on the curve \( g(x) \):
  - \( A = (-2, 4) \)
  - \( B = (-1, 0) \)
  - \( C = (0, -2) \)
  - \( D = (2, 0) \)
  - \( E = (3, 4) \)
- The function \( f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 \) is given.

#### Key Observations:
- The function \( g(x) \) is quadratic, as indicated by its parabolic shape.
- The roots of \( g(x) \) are the \( x \)-coordinates where the curve intersects the \( x \)-axis. From the image, these roots are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 2 \).

#### Question:
We need to determine how many roots the functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) have in common.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Roots of \( g(x) \)
- From the image, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 2 \). These are the points where \( g(x) = 0 \).

#### Step 2.2: Roots of \( f(x) \)
- The function \( f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 \) is also quadratic. To find its roots, solve the equation:
  \[
  f(x) = x^2 + x - 6 = 0
  \]
- Factorize the quadratic equation:
  \[
  x^2 + x - 6 = (x + 3)(x - 2) = 0
  \]
- The roots are:
  \[
  x = -3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = 2
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Common Roots
- Compare the roots of \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \):
  - Roots of \( g(x) \): \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 2 \)
  - Roots of \( f(x) \): \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \)
- The common root is \( x = 2 \).

#### Step 2.4: Conclusion
- The functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) share one root in common (\( x = 2 \)).
- Each function has another root that is not shared:
  - \( g(x) \) has \( x = -1 \) as a root, which is not a root of \( f(x) \).
  - \( f(x) \) has \( x = -3 \) as a root, which is not a root of \( g(x) \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The functions \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) share one root in common but each has another root that is not shared. Therefore, the correct choice is:
