QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### From the Image:
- There are four lines: \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).
- Lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel (\(a \parallel b\)).
- Angles are labeled as \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), and \(4\).
- Angle \(1\) is adjacent to angle \(2\) and both are formed by line \(c\) intersecting line \(a\) and line \(b\).
- Angle \(3\) is adjacent to angle \(4\) and both are formed by line \(d\) intersecting line \(a\) and line \(b\).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Angles:**
   - \( \text{Equals(MeasureOf(1), 100.0)} \): Angle \(1 = 100^\circ\).
   - \( \text{Equals(MeasureOf(2), 100.0)} \): Angle \(2 = 100^\circ\).
   - \( \text{Equals(MeasureOf(3), 125.0)} \): Angle \(3 = 125^\circ\).
   - \( \text{SumOf(MeasureOf(3), MeasureOf(4))} \): The sum of angles \(3\) and \(4\) is \(180^\circ\).

2. **Lines:**
   - \( \text{Parallel(a, b)} \): Lines \(a\) and \(b\) are parallel.

#### Key Observations:
- Since \(a \parallel b\), corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific relationships.
- The problem asks us to determine the measure of angle \(4\).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze Angle Relationships Between Parallel Lines
- **Corresponding Angles Theorem:** When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, corresponding angles are equal.
- **Alternate Interior Angles Theorem:** When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, alternate interior angles are equal.
- **Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem:** When a transversal intersects two parallel lines, consecutive interior angles are supplementary (sum to \(180^\circ\)).

#### Step 2.2: Use the Given Angles
- **Angle 1 and Angle 2:**
  - Both angles are given as \(100^\circ\). Since they are corresponding angles formed by the transversal \(c\) intersecting the parallel lines \(a\) and \(b\), this confirms the parallelism of \(a\) and \(b\).

- **Angle 3 and Angle 4:**
  - The predicate states that \( \text{SumOf(MeasureOf(3), MeasureOf(4))} = 180^\circ \). This means angles \(3\) and \(4\) are consecutive interior angles formed by the transversal \(d\) intersecting the parallel lines \(a\) and \(b\).

#### Step 2.3: Calculate Angle 4
- We know:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf(3)} + \text{MeasureOf(4)} = 180^\circ
  \]
  - Substituting the given value of angle \(3\):
    \[
    125^\circ + \text{MeasureOf(4)} = 180^\circ
    \]
  - Solve for \(\text{MeasureOf(4)}\):
    \[
    \text{MeasureOf(4)} = 180^\circ - 125^\circ = 55^\circ
    \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The measure of angle \(4\) is \(55^\circ\).
- The correct choice is \(D\).

Final Answer: D
