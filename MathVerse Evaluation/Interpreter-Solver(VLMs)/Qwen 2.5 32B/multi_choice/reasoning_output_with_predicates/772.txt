### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### Visual and Predicate Information:
1. **Lines and Perpendicularity**:
   - Line \( k \) and line \( l \) are perpendicular (\( \text{Perpendicular}(Line(k), Line(l)) \)).
   - This means the angle between \( k \) and \( l \) is \( 90^\circ \) (\( \text{Equals}(\text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(l, k)), 90) \)).

2. **Intersection Angles**:
   - Line \( k \) intersects line \( m \) at an angle of \( x^\circ \) (\( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(k, m), x) \)).
   - Lines \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel.

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since \( k \) and \( l \) are perpendicular, the angle between them is fixed at \( 90^\circ \).
   - The angle \( x \) is formed between \( k \) and \( m \). Because \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel, \( x \) cannot be equal to the angle between \( l \) and \( m \).

#### Key Question:
We need to determine which value of \( x \) is **not possible** given the constraints.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Angle Between \( k \) and \( l \)
- From the predicate \( \text{Perpendicular}(Line(k), Line(l)) \), we know:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(l, k)) = 90^\circ.
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Relationship Between \( k \), \( l \), and \( m \)
- Since \( k \) is perpendicular to \( l \), the angle between \( k \) and \( l \) is fixed at \( 90^\circ \).
- Line \( m \) intersects \( k \) at an angle \( x \). Because \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel, the angle \( x \) must differ from the angle between \( l \) and \( m \).

#### Step 2.3: Analyze Possible Values of \( x \)
- The angle \( x \) is measured between \( k \) and \( m \). Since \( k \) is perpendicular to \( l \), the angle \( x \) can take any value except those that would imply \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel.
- If \( x = 90^\circ \), then \( m \) would be parallel to \( l \) because \( k \) is perpendicular to both \( l \) and \( m \). However, the problem states that \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel. Therefore, \( x \) cannot be \( 90^\circ \).

#### Step 2.4: Verify Other Choices
- For \( x = 89^\circ \), \( 91^\circ \), \( 92^\circ \), or \( 93^\circ \):
  - These values do not imply that \( l \) and \( m \) are parallel. They represent slight deviations from the perpendicular relationship, which is consistent with the condition that \( l \) and \( m \) are not parallel.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The only value of \( x \) that cannot occur is \( 90^\circ \), because it would make \( l \) and \( m \) parallel, contradicting the given condition.
