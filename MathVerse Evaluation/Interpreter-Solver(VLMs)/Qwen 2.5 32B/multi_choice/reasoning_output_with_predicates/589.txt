### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Image Analysis:
1. **Graph Description**:
   - The gray curve represents the function \( f(x) = \ln x \).
   - The black curve represents the function \( g(x) \), which is a transformation of \( f(x) \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Both curves have the same general shape, indicating that \( g(x) \) is a transformed version of \( f(x) \).
   - The black curve (\( g(x) \)) appears to be shifted vertically upward compared to the gray curve (\( f(x) \)).
   - There is no horizontal shift, reflection, or change in the steepness of the curve.

#### Predicates Analysis:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0), Line(x))**:
   - This indicates that the point (0, 0) lies on the x-axis.
   - Since the domain of \( \ln x \) starts at \( x > 0 \), this predicate does not directly affect the analysis of transformations.

2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0), Line(y))**:
   - This indicates that the point (0, 0) lies on the y-axis.
   - Again, this does not directly affect the analysis since the domain of \( \ln x \) excludes \( x = 0 \).

3. **Perpendicular(Line(x), Line(y))**:
   - This confirms that the x-axis and y-axis are perpendicular, which is standard for Cartesian coordinates.

#### Question Focus:
The task is to determine the type of transformation applied to \( f(x) = \ln x \) to obtain \( g(x) \). Based on the visual evidence, we need to identify whether the transformation is a vertical dilation, vertical translation, reflection, or horizontal translation.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Type of Transformation
1. **Vertical Dilation**:
   - A vertical dilation would stretch or compress the graph of \( f(x) \) vertically, changing its steepness.
   - From the graph, the shape of \( g(x) \) is identical to \( f(x) \), so there is no vertical dilation.

2. **Vertical Translation**:
   - A vertical translation shifts the entire graph up or down without changing its shape.
   - The black curve (\( g(x) \)) is clearly shifted upward compared to the gray curve (\( f(x) \)), but it retains the same shape.
   - This suggests a vertical translation.

3. **Reflection**:
   - A reflection would flip the graph across either the x-axis or y-axis.
   - The black curve (\( g(x) \)) is not flipped relative to the gray curve (\( f(x) \)), so there is no reflection.

4. **Horizontal Translation**:
   - A horizontal translation would shift the graph left or right.
   - The black curve (\( g(x) \)) does not appear to be shifted horizontally; it maintains the same x-intercept structure as \( f(x) \).

#### Step 2.2: Confirm the Vertical Translation
- The black curve (\( g(x) \)) is uniformly shifted upward compared to the gray curve (\( f(x) \)).
- This behavior is characteristic of a vertical translation, where \( g(x) = f(x) + k \) for some constant \( k > 0 \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the analysis:
- The black curve (\( g(x) \)) is a vertical translation of the gray curve (\( f(x) \)).
- There is no evidence of vertical dilation, reflection, or horizontal translation.

Thus, the correct answer is:
