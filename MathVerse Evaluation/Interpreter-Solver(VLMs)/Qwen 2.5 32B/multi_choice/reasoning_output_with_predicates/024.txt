QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

From the given predicates and the image:
1. **Lines and Points**:
   - Line \( a \) and Line \( b \) are parallel (\( \text{Parallel}(a, b) \)).
   - Line \( c \) intersects Line \( a \) at some point and Line \( b \) at another point.
   - Angle \( 1 \) is formed between Line \( c \) and Line \( a \).
   - Angle \( 2 \) is formed between Line \( c \) and Line \( b \).

2. **Measurements**:
   - The measure of Angle \( 1 \) is given as \( 50^\circ \) (\( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(1), 50.0) \)).

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since Line \( a \) and Line \( b \) are parallel, and Line \( c \) is a transversal, the angles formed by the transversal with the parallel lines have specific relationships:
     - Corresponding angles are equal.
     - Alternate interior angles are equal.
     - Consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles) are supplementary (sum to \( 180^\circ \)).

4. **Question**:
   - We need to determine the measure of Angle \( 2 \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Relationship Between Angles
- Since Line \( a \) and Line \( b \) are parallel, and Line \( c \) is a transversal:
  - Angle \( 1 \) and Angle \( 2 \) are consecutive interior angles (also called same-side interior angles). These angles lie on the same side of the transversal and between the two parallel lines.
  - By the **Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem**, consecutive interior angles are supplementary. That is:
    \[
    \text{Measure of Angle } 1 + \text{Measure of Angle } 2 = 180^\circ
    \]

#### Step 2.2: Substitute the Given Value
- The measure of Angle \( 1 \) is given as \( 50^\circ \):
  \[
  50^\circ + \text{Measure of Angle } 2 = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for the Measure of Angle \( 2 \)
- Rearrange the equation to solve for the measure of Angle \( 2 \):
  \[
  \text{Measure of Angle } 2 = 180^\circ - 50^\circ = 130^\circ
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The measure of Angle \( 2 \) is \( 130^\circ \).
- From the given choices:
  - A: \( 150^\circ \)
  - B: \( 130^\circ \)
  - C: \( 100^\circ \)
  - D: \( 50^\circ \)

The correct answer is \( \text{B} \).

### Final Answer: B
