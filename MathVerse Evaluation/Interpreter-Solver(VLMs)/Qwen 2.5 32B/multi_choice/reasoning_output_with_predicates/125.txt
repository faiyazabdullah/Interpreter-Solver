### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the problem and the given predicates, we extract the following key information:
1. **Sector OAB**:
   - Point \( O \) is the center of the sector.
   - Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the circumference of the sector.
   - \( \text{Angle } \angle AOB = 120^\circ \).
   - \( OA = OB = 30.0 \) cm (both are radii of the sector).

2. **Combining OA and OB**:
   - The sector is folded into a cone, where \( OA \) and \( OB \) become the slant height of the cone.
   - The arc \( AB \) forms the circumference of the base of the cone.

3. **Goal**:
   - Find the radius of the bottom circle of the chimney cap (the base of the cone).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Arc Length \( AB \)
The arc length \( AB \) of the sector can be calculated using the formula for the arc length of a sector:
\[
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi r
\]
where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees, and \( r \) is the radius of the sector.

Here:
- \( \theta = 120^\circ \)
- \( r = 30.0 \) cm

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi \times 30 = \frac{1}{3} \times 2\pi \times 30 = 20\pi \text{ cm}
\]

Thus, the arc length \( AB \) is \( 20\pi \) cm.

#### Step 2.2: Relate the Arc Length to the Cone's Base Circumference
When the sector is folded into a cone, the arc \( AB \) becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let \( R \) be the radius of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base of the cone is given by:
\[
\text{Circumference of the base} = 2\pi R
\]
Since the arc length \( AB \) is equal to the circumference of the base of the cone:
\[
2\pi R = 20\pi
\]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for the Radius \( R \)
Divide both sides of the equation by \( 2\pi \):
\[
R = \frac{20\pi}{2\pi} = 10 \text{ cm}
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The radius of the bottom circle of the chimney cap is \( 10 \) cm. Therefore, the correct choice is:
\[
\boxed{C}
\]
