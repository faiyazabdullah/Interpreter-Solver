QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### From the Image:
- The image shows two parallel lines \( m \) and \( n \).
- Four angles are labeled as \( \text{Angle}(1) \), \( \text{Angle}(2) \), \( \text{Angle}(3) \), and \( \text{Angle}(4) \).
- Angle 2 is marked as \( 60^\circ \).

#### From Predicates:
1. **Parallel Lines**: Parallel(Line(m), Line(n)).
2. **Equal Angles**: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(1)), MeasureOf(Angle(3))).
3. **Given Angle**: Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(2)), 60.0).

#### Key Observations:
- Since \( m \) and \( n \) are parallel, corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific properties.
- Angle 1 and Angle 3 are equal by the given predicate.
- Angle 2 is explicitly given as \( 60^\circ \).

#### Question:
We need to determine the measure of Angle 4.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify Relationships Between Angles
1. **Corresponding Angles**:
   - Since \( m \parallel n \), Angle 2 and its corresponding angle on line \( n \) are congruent. However, Angle 2 is not directly adjacent to Angle 4, so we focus on other relationships.

2. **Alternate Interior Angles**:
   - Angle 1 and Angle 2 are alternate interior angles because they are formed by the transversal intersecting the parallel lines \( m \) and \( n \). Therefore:
     \[
     \text{MeasureOf(Angle(1))} = \text{MeasureOf(Angle(2))} = 60^\circ.
     \]

3. **Equal Angles**:
   - By the given predicate, Angle 1 and Angle 3 are equal:
     \[
     \text{MeasureOf(Angle(1))} = \text{MeasureOf(Angle(3))}.
     \]
   - Since \( \text{MeasureOf(Angle(1))} = 60^\circ \):
     \[
     \text{MeasureOf(Angle(3))} = 60^\circ.
     \]

4. **Consecutive Interior Angles**:
   - Angle 3 and Angle 4 are consecutive interior angles (also known as same-side interior angles) because they are on the same side of the transversal and between the parallel lines \( m \) and \( n \). Consecutive interior angles are supplementary, meaning their measures add up to \( 180^\circ \):
     \[
     \text{MeasureOf(Angle(3))} + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(4))} = 180^\circ.
     \]

5. **Calculate Angle 4**:
   - Substitute \( \text{MeasureOf(Angle(3))} = 60^\circ \) into the equation:
     \[
     60^\circ + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(4))} = 180^\circ.
     \]
   - Solve for \( \text{MeasureOf(Angle(4))} \):
     \[
     \text{MeasureOf(Angle(4))} = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ.
     \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The measure of Angle 4 is \( 120^\circ \). This corresponds to choice C.
