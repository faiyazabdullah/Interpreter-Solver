QUESTION:
Kai is swinging on a trapeze in a circus show. The horizontal distance between Kai and the edge of the stage, in meters, is modeled by $D(t)$ where $t$ is the time in seconds. The function is graphed below, along with one segment highlighted, a red double arrow from (5,21) to (15,21). What is the meaning of the highlighted segment?

CHOICES:
A:Kai completes 10 swing cycles per second.
B:The trapeze is hung $\mathbf{1 0}$ meters from the edge of the stage.
C:Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds.
D:The trapeze is $\mathbf{1 0}$ meters long.

====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### Visual Information:
- The graph shows a periodic function \( D(t) \), which models the horizontal distance between Kai and the edge of the stage over time \( t \).
- The highlighted segment is a horizontal line segment from \( (5, 21) \) to \( (15, 21) \). This segment is parallel to the \( t \)-axis, indicating that the horizontal distance \( y \) remains constant at 21 meters during this interval.
- The time interval for this segment is from \( t = 5 \) to \( t = 15 \) seconds.

#### Predicates:
- **Point(A)** and **Point(B)** are defined such that:
  - \( y(A) = 21 \) and \( y(B) = 21 \).
  - \( t(A) = 5 \) and \( t(B) = 15 \).
  - The length of the segment \( \text{Line}(A, B) \) is 10 units.
- **Function(D)** represents the distance function \( D(t) \).
- The highlighted segment corresponds to the points \( A \) and \( B \).

#### Key Observations:
- The highlighted segment indicates a constant horizontal distance of 21 meters between \( t = 5 \) and \( t = 15 \) seconds.
- The length of the segment \( \text{Line}(A, B) \) is 10 units, which corresponds to the time interval \( t(B) - t(A) = 15 - 5 = 10 \) seconds.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Inference 1: Interpretation of the Highlighted Segment
- The highlighted segment lies on the graph of \( D(t) \), where the function value \( D(t) = 21 \) meters for \( t \) in the interval \([5, 15]\).
- Since the segment is horizontal, it implies that the horizontal distance from Kai to the edge of the stage does not change during this time interval.

#### Inference 2: Time Interval and Swing Cycle
- The time interval of the highlighted segment is 10 seconds (\( t(B) - t(A) = 15 - 5 = 10 \)).
- In the context of a trapeze swing, a single swing cycle typically involves moving away from and returning to the starting point. The constant distance of 21 meters suggests that Kai is at the farthest point of his swing during this interval.
- Therefore, the 10-second interval likely corresponds to the duration of a single swing cycle.

#### Inference 3: Elimination of Incorrect Choices
- **Choice A**: "Kai completes 10 swing cycles per second."  
  - This is incorrect because the highlighted segment represents a single swing cycle lasting 10 seconds, not 10 cycles per second.
- **Choice B**: "The trapeze is hung 10 meters from the edge of the stage."  
  - This is incorrect because the highlighted segment does not provide information about the trapeze's height or distance from the stage; it only indicates the horizontal distance during a specific time interval.
- **Choice D**: "The trapeze is 10 meters long."  
  - This is incorrect for the same reason as Choice B. The highlighted segment pertains to the horizontal distance, not the length of the trapeze.

#### Inference 4: Correct Interpretation
- The highlighted segment indicates that Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds. This aligns with the time interval of the segment and the periodic nature of the swing motion.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The highlighted segment signifies that Kai completes a single swing cycle in 10 seconds. Therefore, the correct interpretation is:
