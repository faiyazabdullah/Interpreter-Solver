QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given image and predicates:
1. **Lines and Points**:
   - Line \( c \) intersects lines \( a \) and \( b \).
   - Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) lie on line \( c \).
   - Line \( a \) passes through point \( C \).
   - Line \( b \) is parallel to line \( a \).

2. **Angles**:
   - Angle 1 is formed between line \( c \) and line \( a \).
   - Angle 2 is formed between line \( c \) and line \( b \).
   - The measure of Angle 1 is given as \( 50^\circ \).

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since \( a \parallel b \), the corresponding angles formed by the transversal \( c \) are equal.
   - The question asks for the measure of Angle 2.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify Corresponding Angles
- By the **Corresponding Angles Postulate**, when two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, the corresponding angles are congruent.
- In this case, Angle 1 and Angle 2 are corresponding angles because:
  - Angle 1 is formed by the intersection of line \( c \) and line \( a \).
  - Angle 2 is formed by the intersection of line \( c \) and line \( b \).
  - Since \( a \parallel b \), Angle 1 and Angle 2 are corresponding angles.

#### Step 2.2: Apply the Corresponding Angles Postulate
- According to the Corresponding Angles Postulate:
  \[
  \text{If } a \parallel b \text{ and } c \text{ is a transversal, then } \text{Measure of Angle 1} = \text{Measure of Angle 2}.
  \]
- Given that the measure of Angle 1 is \( 50^\circ \):
  \[
  \text{Measure of Angle 2} = 50^\circ.
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The measure of Angle 2 is \( 50^\circ \).
- Therefore, the correct choice is:
  \[
  \text{Final Answer: A}
  \]

Final Answer: A
