QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a parabola labeled \( y = g(x) \).
- Key points on the graph:
  - Vertex at \( (-2, 3) \).
  - Points \( (0, 7) \) and \( (-4, 7) \) lie on the parabola.
- The parabola opens upwards, indicating that \( g(x) \) is a quadratic function with a minimum value at its vertex.

#### From the Predicates:
- \( \text{PointLiesOnLine}(Point(0,7), Line(y, g(x))) \): The point \( (0, 7) \) lies on \( y = g(x) \).
- \( \text{PointLiesOnLine}(Point(-4,7), Line(y, g(x))) \): The point \( (-4, 7) \) lies on \( y = g(x) \).
- \( \text{PointLiesOnLine}(Point(-2,3), Line(y, g(x))) \): The point \( (-2, 3) \) lies on \( y = g(x) \).
- \( \text{Equals}(3, 3) \), \( \text{Equals}(7, 7) \), \( \text{Equals}(-4, -4) \), \( \text{Equals}(-2, -2) \): These indicate that the coordinates of the points are consistent with their labels.

#### Key Observations:
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \( (-2, 3) \), so the minimum value of \( g(x) \) is 3.
- The given function \( f(x) = 4(x-5)^2 + 2 \) is also a quadratic function in vertex form, with the vertex at \( (5, 2) \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Analyze \( g(x) \):
- The vertex form of a quadratic function is \( y = a(x-h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex.
- For \( g(x) \), the vertex is \( (-2, 3) \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( g(x) \) is the \( y \)-coordinate of the vertex, which is 3.

#### Analyze \( f(x) \):
- The function \( f(x) = 4(x-5)^2 + 2 \) is already in vertex form.
- The vertex of \( f(x) \) is \( (5, 2) \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is the \( y \)-coordinate of the vertex, which is 2.

#### Compare the Minimum Values:
- The minimum value of \( g(x) \) is 3.
- The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 2.
- Since 2 < 3, \( f(x) \) has a smaller minimum value than \( g(x) \).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The function \( f(x) \) has a greater minimum than \( g(x) \). Therefore, the correct choice is:
