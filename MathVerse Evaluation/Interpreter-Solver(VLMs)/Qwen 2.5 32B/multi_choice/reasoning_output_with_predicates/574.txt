QUESTION:
Simon has a certain length of fencing to enclose a rectangular area. The quadratic function A with a vertec of (10, 100) models the rectangle's area (in square meters) as a function of its width (in meters). It intersects with x-axis at (0,0) and (20,0). Which of these statements are true?

CHOICES:
A:Greater width always relates to smaller area.
B:Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than $10 \mathrm{~m}$.
C:When there is no width, the area is $20 \mathrm{~m}^2$.
D:When there is no width, the area is $0 \mathrm{~m}^2$.

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a quadratic function \( A(w) \) representing the area of a rectangle as a function of its width \( w \).
- The vertex of the parabola is at \( (10, 100) \), indicating the maximum area occurs when the width is 10 meters.
- The parabola intersects the x-axis at \( (0, 0) \) and \( (20, 0) \), meaning the width cannot exceed 20 meters.
- The y-axis represents the area in square meters, and the x-axis represents the width in meters.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Vertex of the Parabola**: 
   - The vertex is at \( (10, 100) \), which means the maximum area is 100 square meters when the width is 10 meters.
   - By definition, the vertex is the midpoint of the x-intercepts, confirming the symmetry of the parabola.

2. **X-Intercepts**:
   - The parabola intersects the x-axis at \( (0, 0) \) and \( (20, 0) \). These points represent scenarios where the width is 0 meters or 20 meters, resulting in zero area.

3. **Relationship Between Width and Area**:
   - The quadratic function \( A(w) \) opens downwards because it has a maximum value at the vertex.
   - The width \( w \) is a variable that determines the area, and the function is symmetric about the vertical line through the vertex.

#### Key Question:
We need to analyze the relationship between the width and the area, and evaluate the truth of the given statements.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Statement A: "Greater width always relates to smaller area."
- **Analysis**:
  - The parabola opens downwards, meaning the area decreases as the width moves away from the vertex (10 meters).
  - However, this relationship only holds for widths greater than 10 meters. For widths less than 10 meters, the area increases as the width increases.
  - Therefore, this statement is **not always true**.

#### Statement B: "Greater width relates to smaller area as long as the width is less than \( 10 \mathrm{~m} \)."
- **Analysis**:
  - This statement is incorrect because, for widths less than 10 meters, the area actually increases as the width increases. The area decreases only for widths greater than 10 meters.
  - Therefore, this statement is **false**.

#### Statement C: "When there is no width, the area is \( 20 \mathrm{~m}^2 \)."
- **Analysis**:
  - When the width is 0 meters, the corresponding point on the graph is \( (0, 0) \). This means the area is 0 square meters, not 20 square meters.
  - Therefore, this statement is **false**.

#### Statement D: "When there is no width, the area is \( 0 \mathrm{~m}^2 \)."
- **Analysis**:
  - When the width is 0 meters, the corresponding point on the graph is \( (0, 0) \). This means the area is indeed 0 square meters.
  - Therefore, this statement is **true**.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the analysis, the only true statement is D.

Final Answer: D
