QUESTION:
In a memory study, subjects are asked to memorize some content and recall as much as they can remember each day thereafter. Each day, Maximilian finds that he has forgotten $15 \%$ of what he could recount the day before. Lucy also took part in the study. The given graphs represent the percentage of content that Maximilian (gray) and Lucy (black) could remember after $t$ days. y-axis labels "days" and x-axis labels "recall percentage"

Which of the following could model the percentage that Lucy can still recall after $t$ days?

CHOICES:
A:$Q=(0.85)^{t}$
B:$Q=(0.83)^{t}$
C:$Q=(0.87)^{t}$

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows two curves representing the percentage of content recalled over time (days).
- The black curve represents Lucy's recall percentage.
- The gray curve represents Maximilian's recall percentage.
- Maximilian forgets 15% of what he could recall the day before. This implies his recall percentage decreases by a factor of \( 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \) each day.
- Lucy's recall percentage (black curve) appears to decay more slowly than Maximilian's, indicating her forgetting rate is less than 15%.

#### From the Predicates:
- **PointLiesOnLine(Point(100), Line(0,100))**: This indicates that at \( t = 0 \) days, both subjects start with 100% recall.
- **Perpendicular(Line(days), Line(recall percentage))**: This confirms that the axes are orthogonal, ensuring proper interpretation of the graph.

#### Key Observations:
- Both curves start at 100% recall when \( t = 0 \).
- The black curve (Lucy's recall) decays more gradually than the gray curve (Maximilian's recall).

#### Question:
We need to determine which function could model Lucy's recall percentage \( Q \) after \( t \) days. The choices are:
- A: \( Q = (0.85)^t \)
- B: \( Q = (0.83)^t \)
- C: \( Q = (0.87)^t \)

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Decay Model
The general form of exponential decay is:
\[
Q(t) = Q_0 \cdot r^t
\]
where:
- \( Q_0 \) is the initial recall percentage (100% at \( t = 0 \)).
- \( r \) is the decay factor, representing the fraction of recall retained each day.
- \( t \) is the number of days.

For Maximilian, the decay factor is \( r = 0.85 \) because he forgets 15% each day. His recall is modeled by:
\[
Q_{\text{Maximilian}}(t) = 100 \cdot (0.85)^t
\]

For Lucy, the decay factor \( r \) must be greater than 0.85 (since her recall decays more slowly than Maximilian's). Therefore, \( r > 0.85 \).

#### Step 2.2: Analyzing the Choices
- **Choice A: \( Q = (0.85)^t \)**  
  This corresponds to Maximilian's decay factor. Since Lucy's recall decays more slowly, this cannot model Lucy's recall.

- **Choice B: \( Q = (0.83)^t \)**  
  This decay factor \( r = 0.83 \) is less than 0.85. This would imply that Lucy's recall decays faster than Maximilian's, which contradicts the graph. Therefore, this is incorrect.

- **Choice C: \( Q = (0.87)^t \)**  
  This decay factor \( r = 0.87 \) is greater than 0.85. This means Lucy retains more of her recall each day compared to Maximilian, consistent with the slower decay observed in the black curve.

#### Step 2.3: Verifying the Slow Decay
The black curve (Lucy's recall) clearly decays more slowly than the gray curve (Maximilian's recall). Since Maximilian's decay factor is 0.85, Lucy's decay factor must be greater than 0.85. Among the choices, only \( r = 0.87 \) satisfies this condition.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The function that could model Lucy's recall percentage after \( t \) days is:
\[
Q = (0.87)^t
\]
