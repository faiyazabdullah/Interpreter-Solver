QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a quadratic function \( y = g(x) \) that opens upwards.
- The vertex of the parabola is at \( (3, -8) \).
- The function \( g(x) \) passes through the point \( (6, 1) \).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Vertex of \( g(x) \)**:
   - The vertex of \( g(x) \) is given as \( V = (3, -8) \).
   - The equation of \( g(x) \) is \( g(x) = (x - 3)^2 - 8 \).

2. **\( g(0) \)**:
   - It is given that \( g(0) = 1 \).

3. **Function \( f(x) \)**:
   - The equation of \( f(x) \) is \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 \).
   - It is given that \( f(0) = 1 \).

4. **Comparison**:
   - We need to compare the \( y \)-intercepts of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).
   - The \( y \)-intercept of a function is the value of the function when \( x = 0 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the \( y \)-intercept of \( g(x) \)
- The \( y \)-intercept occurs when \( x = 0 \).
- Using the given equation \( g(x) = (x - 3)^2 - 8 \):
  \[
  g(0) = (0 - 3)^2 - 8 = 9 - 8 = 1
  \]
- Therefore, the \( y \)-intercept of \( g(x) \) is \( 1 \).

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the \( y \)-intercept of \( f(x) \)
- The \( y \)-intercept occurs when \( x = 0 \).
- Using the given equation \( f(x) = x^2 - 2x + 1 \):
  \[
  f(0) = 0^2 - 2(0) + 1 = 1
  \]
- Therefore, the \( y \)-intercept of \( f(x) \) is \( 1 \).

#### Step 2.3: Compare the \( y \)-intercepts
- From the calculations:
  - The \( y \)-intercept of \( g(x) \) is \( 1 \).
  - The \( y \)-intercept of \( f(x) \) is \( 1 \).
- Both functions have the same \( y \)-intercept.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Since both \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \) have the same \( y \)-intercept of \( 1 \), the correct choice is:
\[
\text{Final Answer: C}
\]
