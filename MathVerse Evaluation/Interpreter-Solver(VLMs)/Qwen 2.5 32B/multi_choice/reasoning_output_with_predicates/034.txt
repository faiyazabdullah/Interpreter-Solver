QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
1. **Lines and Points**:
   - Line \(AB\) and line \(CD\) are parallel (\(AB \parallel CD\)).
   - Line \(EF\) intersects both \(AB\) and \(CD\) at points labeled as intersections.
   - The intersection of \(EF\) with \(AB\) creates angle 1, which is given as 100°.
   - The intersection of \(EF\) with \(CD\) creates angle 2, which we need to determine.

2. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since \(AB \parallel CD\), corresponding angles, alternate interior angles, and consecutive interior angles have specific properties.
   - Angle 1 is formed by the transversal \(EF\) intersecting the parallel lines \(AB\) and \(CD\).

3. **Specific Values**:
   - Measure of angle 1 (\(\text{MeasureOf(Angle(1))}\)) is 100°.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify Angle Types
- Angle 1 is an interior angle on the same side of the transversal \(EF\) as angle 2. These angles are **consecutive interior angles** because they lie between the parallel lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) on the same side of the transversal.

#### Step 2.2: Use the Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem
- The Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem states that if two parallel lines are cut by a transversal, then the consecutive interior angles are supplementary. That is, their measures add up to 180°.
- Let angle 2 be denoted as \(\text{MeasureOf(Angle(2))}\).
- According to the theorem:
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf(Angle(1))} + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(2))} = 180^\circ
  \]
- Substituting the given value of angle 1:
  \[
  100^\circ + \text{MeasureOf(Angle(2))} = 180^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for Angle 2
- Rearrange the equation to solve for \(\text{MeasureOf(Angle(2))}\):
  \[
  \text{MeasureOf(Angle(2))} = 180^\circ - 100^\circ = 80^\circ
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
- The measure of angle 2 is 80°.
- From the given choices:
  - A: 10°
  - B: 50°
  - C: 80°
  - D: 100°

The correct answer is C.
