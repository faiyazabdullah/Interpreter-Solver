QUESTION:
The graph, which is a piecewise function and passes through the origin, shows John's speed while he is competing in a walking race, the x-axis representing Time and the y-axis representing Speed. Which situation corresponds to the graph?

CHOICES:
A:John increases his speed for the first half of the race and then decreases his speed in the second half
B:John increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race
C:John starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then stops as he trips over a stick, but then recovers and is able to increase his speed steadily until the end of the race
D:John starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then continues to steadily increase his pace at a faster rate

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### Visual Observations:
- The graph is a piecewise function, meaning it consists of multiple segments with different slopes.
- The graph starts at the origin \((0, 0)\), indicating that John's initial speed is zero.
- The graph has three distinct segments:
  1. A straight line with a positive slope, indicating John's speed increases linearly over time.
  2. A horizontal segment, indicating John's speed remains constant for a period.
  3. Another straight line with a steeper positive slope, indicating John's speed increases again, but at a faster rate than before.

#### Predicates:
- **Point(Origin)**: There is a point at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- **Line(TimeAxis)** and **Line(SpeedAxis)**: The axes represent time and speed, respectively.
- **Perpendicular(TimeAxis, SpeedAxis)**: The axes are perpendicular.
- **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, TimeAxis)** and **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, SpeedAxis)**: The origin lies on both axes.
- **Shape(Graph)**: The graph is a piecewise function.

#### Key Measurements and Relationships:
- The graph shows a gradual increase in speed initially, followed by a plateau, and then a steeper increase.
- The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents speed.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Segment 1: Initial Increase in Speed
- The first segment of the graph is a straight line with a positive slope. This indicates that John's speed increases at a constant rate during this period. By the definition of slope, the rate of change of speed with respect to time is constant.
  - **Justification**: The slope of a line represents the rate of change. Since the line is straight, the rate of change is uniform.

#### Segment 2: Constant Speed
- The second segment of the graph is horizontal. This indicates that John's speed does not change during this period; it remains constant.
  - **Justification**: A horizontal line on a speed-time graph implies zero acceleration, meaning the speed is constant.

#### Segment 3: Steeper Increase in Speed
- The third segment of the graph is another straight line with a steeper positive slope than the first segment. This indicates that John's speed increases again, but at a faster rate than in the initial phase.
  - **Justification**: The steeper slope means the rate of change of speed with respect to time is greater than in the first segment.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
#### Matching the Graph to the Situations:
- **Choice A**: John increases his speed for the first half of the race and then decreases his speed in the second half.
  - This does not match the graph because there is no segment where John's speed decreases.

- **Choice B**: John increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race.
  - This does not match the graph because the speed does not increase at a constant rate throughout; there is a period of constant speed and a later period of increased acceleration.

- **Choice C**: John starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then stops as he trips over a stick, but then recovers and is able to increase his speed steadily until the end of the race.
  - This does not match the graph because there is no indication of John stopping (speed dropping to zero) and then recovering.

- **Choice D**: John starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then continues to steadily increase his pace at a faster rate.
  - This matches the graph perfectly. The first segment shows a gradual increase in speed, the second segment shows a period of constant speed, and the third segment shows a steeper increase in speed, indicating a faster rate of acceleration.
