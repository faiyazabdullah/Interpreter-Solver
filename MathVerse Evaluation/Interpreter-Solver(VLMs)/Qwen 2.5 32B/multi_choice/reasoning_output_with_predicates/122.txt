### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given predicates and the image:
1. **Shape(Sector(O,A,B))**: The figure includes a sector with center \( O \) and radii \( OA \) and \( OB \).
2. **MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,B), 120.0)**: The central angle of the sector is \( 120^\circ \).
3. **LengthOf(Line(O,A), 6.0)** and **LengthOf(Line(O,B), 6.0)**: Both radii \( OA \) and \( OB \) have a length of 6.
4. **IsRadiusOf(Line(O,A), Sector(O,A,B))** and **IsRadiusOf(Line(O,B), Sector(O,A,B))**: \( OA \) and \( OB \) are the radii of the sector.
5. **IsSideOf(Line(O,A), Cone(C))** and **IsSideOf(Line(O,B), Cone(C))**: The radii \( OA \) and \( OB \) form the slant height of the cone when the sector is folded into a cone.
6. **Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,A)), LengthOf(Line(O,B))**: The radii \( OA \) and \( OB \) are equal, confirming the symmetry of the sector.

The problem states that the sector is folded into a cone, meaning the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone, and the radius of the sector becomes the slant height of the cone. We need to find the height of the cone.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Determine the Arc Length of the Sector**
The arc length \( L \) of a sector with central angle \( \theta \) (in degrees) and radius \( r \) is given by:
\[
L = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi r
\]
Here, \( \theta = 120^\circ \) and \( r = 6 \):
\[
L = \frac{120^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot 2\pi \cdot 6 = \frac{1}{3} \cdot 12\pi = 4\pi
\]
So, the arc length of the sector is \( 4\pi \).

#### **Step 2.2: Relate the Arc Length to the Base Circumference of the Cone**
When the sector is folded into a cone, the arc length of the sector becomes the circumference of the base of the cone. Let \( r_c \) be the radius of the base of the cone. The circumference of the base is:
\[
2\pi r_c = 4\pi
\]
Solving for \( r_c \):
\[
r_c = \frac{4\pi}{2\pi} = 2
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Use the Slant Height and Radius to Find the Height of the Cone**
The slant height of the cone is the radius of the sector, which is 6. Let \( h \) be the height of the cone. The radius of the base \( r_c = 2 \), the slant height \( l = 6 \), and the height \( h \) form a right triangle. By the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
l^2 = r_c^2 + h^2
\]
Substitute \( l = 6 \) and \( r_c = 2 \):
\[
6^2 = 2^2 + h^2
\]
\[
36 = 4 + h^2
\]
\[
h^2 = 32
\]
\[
h = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The height of the cone is \( 4\sqrt{2} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{D}
\]
