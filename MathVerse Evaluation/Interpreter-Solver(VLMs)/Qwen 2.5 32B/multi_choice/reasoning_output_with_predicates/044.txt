QUESTION:
As shown in the figure, the two street lamps A and B are separated by 30.0. One night, when Xiaogang went straight 25.0 from the bottom of street lamp A to the bottom of street lamp B, he found that the top of his figure just touched the bottom of street lamp B. It is known that Xiaogang's height is 1.5, then the height of the street lamp is ()

CHOICES:
A:9米
B:8米
C:7米
D:6米

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

From the problem and the given predicates, we can extract the following critical information:

1. **Street Lamps and Distances:**
   - Street lamp A and street lamp B are separated by a distance of 30.0 meters.
   - Xiaogang walks 25.0 meters from the base of street lamp A to the base of street lamp B.

2. **Xiaogang's Height:**
   - Xiaogang's height is 1.5 meters.

3. **Geometric Relationships:**
   - The top of Xiaogang's head touches the bottom of street lamp B when he is 25.0 meters away from the base of street lamp A.
   - The street lamps are vertical, meaning they form right angles with the ground.
   - The problem involves similar triangles due to the proportional nature of the shadows and heights.

4. **Key Question:**
   - We need to find the height of the street lamp.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Define Variables and Known Quantities
- Let the height of the street lamp be \( H \).
- Xiaogang's height is 1.5 meters.
- The distance between the bases of the street lamps is 30.0 meters.
- Xiaogang walks 25.0 meters from the base of street lamp A to the base of street lamp B.
- Therefore, the remaining distance from Xiaogang's position to the base of street lamp B is \( 30.0 - 25.0 = 5.0 \) meters.

#### Step 2.2: Similar Triangles
The situation forms two similar triangles:
1. The larger triangle formed by the street lamp A, its shadow, and the ground.
2. The smaller triangle formed by Xiaogang, his "shadow" (the part of the street lamp B that he touches), and the ground.

- The height of the street lamp is \( H \).
- The height of the segment of the street lamp that Xiaogang touches is \( H - 1.5 \) (since his head reaches up to this point).
- The base of the larger triangle is 30.0 meters.
- The base of the smaller triangle is 5.0 meters (the remaining distance from Xiaogang to the base of street lamp B).

By the property of similar triangles, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of street lamp}}{\text{Height of segment touched by Xiaogang}} = \frac{\text{Base of larger triangle}}{\text{Base of smaller triangle}}
\]
\[
\frac{H}{H - 1.5} = \frac{30.0}{5.0}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Solve the Proportion
Simplify the right-hand side of the equation:
\[
\frac{H}{H - 1.5} = 6
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( H \):
\[
H = 6(H - 1.5)
\]
\[
H = 6H - 9
\]

Rearrange the equation to isolate \( H \):
\[
H - 6H = -9
\]
\[
-5H = -9
\]
\[
H = \frac{9}{5} = 1.8
\]

However, this result does not seem reasonable given the context. Let us re-evaluate the setup. The correct interpretation should consider the full height of the street lamp and the proportionality of the entire structure.

Revisiting the similar triangles:
\[
\frac{H}{1.5} = \frac{30.0}{5.0}
\]
\[
\frac{H}{1.5} = 6
\]
\[
H = 6 \times 1.5 = 9
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify the Solution
The height of the street lamp is 9 meters. This satisfies the condition that the top of Xiaogang's head touches the bottom of street lamp B when he is 25.0 meters away from street lamp A.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The height of the street lamp is 9 meters.

Final Answer: A
