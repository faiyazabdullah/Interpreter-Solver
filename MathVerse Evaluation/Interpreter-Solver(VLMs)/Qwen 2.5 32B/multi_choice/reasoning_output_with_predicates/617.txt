QUESTION:
The graph, which is a piecewise function and passes through the origin, shows Frank's speed while he is competing in a walking race, the x-axis representing Time and the y-axis representing Speed. Which situation corresponds to the graph?

CHOICES:
A:Frank starts off at a constant speed and then increases his speed at a steady rate
B:Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed
C:Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually, then increases his pace at a faster rate as he sees his arch rival beside him and finally increases his pace at a more gradual pace
D:Frank increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race

====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph is a piecewise linear function, meaning it consists of straight-line segments.
- The graph starts at the origin \((0, 0)\), indicating that at time \(t = 0\), the speed is 0.
- Initially, the graph rises steeply, suggesting an increase in speed over time.
- After a certain point, the graph becomes a horizontal line, indicating that the speed remains constant.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Point(Origin)**: There is a point labeled as the origin.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, Line(Time, Speed))**: The origin lies on the axes defined by the \(x\)-axis (Time) and \(y\)-axis (Speed).
3. **Axis(Time)** and **Axis(Speed)**: These define the coordinate system with Time on the \(x\)-axis and Speed on the \(y\)-axis.
4. **Perpendicular(Axis(Time), Axis(Speed))**: The axes are perpendicular to each other, forming a standard Cartesian coordinate system.
5. **Shape(Graph)** and **Shape(PiecewiseLinearFunction)**: The graph is a piecewise linear function.
6. **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, Graph)**: The graph passes through the origin.

#### Key Observations:
- The graph starts at the origin \((0, 0)\), meaning Frank's initial speed is 0.
- The graph initially rises steeply, indicating an increase in speed over time.
- Eventually, the graph becomes horizontal, meaning Frank's speed stabilizes at a constant value.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Interpret the Initial Segment
- The graph begins at the origin \((0, 0)\) and rises steeply. This indicates that Frank starts with an initial speed of 0 and increases his speed over time.
- Since the segment is linear, the rate of increase in speed is constant during this phase.

#### Step 2.2: Interpret the Horizontal Segment
- After a certain point, the graph becomes horizontal. This means that Frank's speed stops increasing and remains constant.
- A horizontal line in a speed-time graph represents constant velocity.

#### Step 2.3: Match the Graph to the Situations
- **Choice A**: "Frank starts off at a constant speed and then increases his speed at a steady rate."
  - This does not match the graph because the graph starts at 0 speed and increases gradually, not starting at a constant speed.
  
- **Choice B**: "Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually and then maintains a constant speed."
  - This matches the graph perfectly. The initial steep rise indicates an increase in speed, and the horizontal segment indicates that Frank maintains a constant speed afterward.
  
- **Choice C**: "Frank starts off by increasing his pace gradually, then increases his pace at a faster rate as he sees his arch rival beside him and finally increases his pace at a more gradual pace."
  - This does not match the graph because the graph does not show any change in the rate of increase after the initial phase; it simply levels off into a constant speed.
  
- **Choice D**: "Frank increases his speed at a constant rate throughout the entire race."
  - This does not match the graph because the graph shows a transition from increasing speed to maintaining a constant speed.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The graph shows that Frank starts with an initial speed of 0, increases his speed at a steady rate, and then maintains a constant speed. This corresponds to Choice B.
