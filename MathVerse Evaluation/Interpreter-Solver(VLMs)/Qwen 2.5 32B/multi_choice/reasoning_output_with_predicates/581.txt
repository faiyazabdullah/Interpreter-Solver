QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph is a smooth curve that passes through the points \((0, -2)\), \((3, 0)\), and starts from \((-1, -5)\).
- The curve appears to be strictly increasing, meaning as \(x\) increases, \(y\) also increases.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Point Lies on Line**: The points \((0, -2)\), \((3, 0)\), and \((-1, -5)\) lie on the curve.
2. **Shape**: The shape is described as a curve, not a straight line.

#### Key Observations:
- The curve is continuous and smooth.
- The function appears to be one-to-one because it does not show any horizontal lines intersecting the curve more than once (this is visually confirmed from the graph).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Understanding Inverse Functions**
A function \(f(x)\) has an inverse if and only if it is **one-to-one**. This means:
1. For every \(y\) in the range of \(f\), there is exactly one \(x\) such that \(f(x) = y\).
2. Visually, this can be checked using the **Horizontal Line Test**: If any horizontal line intersects the graph of the function at most once, then the function is one-to-one and has an inverse.

#### **Step 2.2: Applying the Horizontal Line Test**
- From the graph, observe that no horizontal line intersects the curve more than once. This is evident because the curve is strictly increasing.
- A strictly increasing function is always one-to-one.

#### **Step 2.3: Verifying One-to-One Property**
- The points \((0, -2)\), \((3, 0)\), and \((-1, -5)\) are distinct, and the curve does not loop back or intersect itself horizontally.
- Since the function is strictly increasing, it satisfies the one-to-one condition.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the analysis:
- The function is strictly increasing.
- The function passes the Horizontal Line Test.
- Therefore, the function is one-to-one and has an inverse.
