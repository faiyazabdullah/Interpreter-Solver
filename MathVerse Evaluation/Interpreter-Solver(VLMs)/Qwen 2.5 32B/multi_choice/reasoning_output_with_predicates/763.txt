A.1:2
B.1:4
C.3:5
D.3:7
E.5:7

QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and the given predicates, we observe the following:
1. There are four concentric circles centered at point \( O \).
2. The radii of the circles are:
   - Circle(1): Radius = 1
   - Circle(2): Radius = 2
   - Circle(3): Radius = 3
   - Circle(4): Radius = 4
3. The circles form two shaded rings:
   - Small shaded ring: Between Circle(2) and Circle(1) (radii 2 and 1).
   - Large shaded ring: Between Circle(4) and Circle(3) (radii 4 and 3).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Area of a Circle
The area \( A \) of a circle with radius \( r \) is given by:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Area of the Small Shaded Ring
The small shaded ring lies between Circle(2) and Circle(1). Its area is the difference in the areas of these two circles:
- Area of Circle(2): \( \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi \)
- Area of Circle(1): \( \pi \times 1^2 = \pi \)
- Area of the small shaded ring:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = 4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
\]

#### Step 2.3: Area of the Large Shaded Ring
The large shaded ring lies between Circle(4) and Circle(3). Its area is the difference in the areas of these two circles:
- Area of Circle(4): \( \pi \times 4^2 = 16\pi \)
- Area of Circle(3): \( \pi \times 3^2 = 9\pi \)
- Area of the large shaded ring:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{large}} = 16\pi - 9\pi = 7\pi
\]

#### Step 2.4: Ratio of the Areas
The ratio of the area of the small shaded ring to the area of the large shaded ring is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{large}}} = \frac{3\pi}{7\pi} = \frac{3}{7}
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The ratio of the area of the small shaded ring to the area of the large shaded ring is \( \frac{3}{7} \). This corresponds to choice D.
