QWEN2.5-VL MODEL RESPONSE (WITH IMAGE + PREDICATES):
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The graph shows a curve with two asymptotes:
   - The horizontal asymptote is the \(x\)-axis (\(y = 0\)).
   - The vertical asymptote is the line \(x = 4\).
2. The curve approaches but never touches these asymptotes.
3. The curve is symmetric about the origin, indicating it may be an odd function.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Line(x-axis)**: This represents the horizontal line \(y = 0\).
2. **Line(A,B)**: A line segment defined by points \(A\) and \(B\). However, the specific details of \(A\) and \(B\) are not relevant here.
3. **Line(m)**: A line perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis, with a measure of 4.
4. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(A), Line(x-axis))**: Point \(A\) lies on the \(x\)-axis.
5. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(B), Line(x-axis))**: Point \(B\) lies on the \(x\)-axis.
6. **Perpendicular(Line(x-axis), Line(m))**: Line \(m\) is perpendicular to the \(x\)-axis.
7. **Equals(4, MeasureOf(m))**: The length or position associated with line \(m\) is 4.
8. **Equals(0, MeasureOf(x-axis))**: The measure of the \(x\)-axis is 0 (indicating it is the reference line).

#### Key Observations:
- The curve approaches the \(x\)-axis as \(x \to \pm\infty\), confirming the horizontal asymptote.
- The curve approaches infinity as \(x \to 4^-\) and \(-\infty\) as \(x \to 4^+\), confirming the vertical asymptote at \(x = 4\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Question: Does the function have an inverse?
To determine if a function has an inverse, we need to check if it is one-to-one (injective). A function is one-to-one if it passes the **horizontal line test**: No horizontal line intersects the graph more than once.

1. **Horizontal Line Test**:
   - Observe the graph: For any horizontal line \(y = c\) (where \(c\) is a constant), the line intersects the curve at most once.
   - This is because the curve does not repeat any \(y\)-values. As \(x\) varies, \(y\) changes monotonically except near the vertical asymptote.

2. **Vertical Asymptote Impact**:
   - The vertical asymptote at \(x = 4\) means the function is undefined at \(x = 4\). However, this does not affect the one-to-one nature of the function elsewhere.
   - The function is still injective because no two distinct \(x\)-values map to the same \(y\)-value.

3. **Behavior Near Asymptotes**:
   - As \(x \to 4^-\), \(y \to +\infty\).
   - As \(x \to 4^+\), \(y \to -\infty\).
   - These behaviors ensure that the function does not repeat any \(y\)-values and remains one-to-one.

4. **Symmetry and Monotonicity**:
   - The curve appears symmetric about the origin, suggesting it is an odd function. Odd functions are typically one-to-one unless they are periodic or have repeated values, which is not the case here.

#### Conclusion from Horizontal Line Test:
The function passes the horizontal line test, meaning it is one-to-one and thus has an inverse.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the above reasoning, the function has an inverse.
