====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image and Predicates:
1. **Points**: \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are given.
2. **Triangle**: \( \triangle ABC \) is formed by the dashed lines connecting points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
3. **Angles**:
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(B, A, C)) = 49^\circ \): This means \( \angle BAC = 49^\circ \).
   - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(A, B, C)) = 41^\circ \): This means \( \angle ABC = 41^\circ \).
4. **Sides**:
   - \( \text{IsSideOf}(Line(A, B), \triangle ABC) \): Line \( AB \) is a side of \( \triangle ABC \).
   - \( \text{IsSideOf}(Line(B, C), \triangle ABC) \): Line \( BC \) is a side of \( \triangle ABC \).
   - \( \text{IsSideOf}(Line(A, C), \triangle ABC) \): Line \( AC \) is a side of \( \triangle ABC \).
5. **Directional Information**:
   - Point \( B \) is due East of point \( A \). This implies that the line \( AB \) lies along the 090° true bearing direction.

#### Key Question:
We need to find the **true bearing of point \( B \) from point \( A \)**. Since \( B \) is due East of \( A \), the true bearing is already known to be \( 090^\circ \). However, we will confirm this using the given angle information and geometric reasoning.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the True Bearing of \( B \) from \( A \)
- The problem states that point \( B \) is due East of point \( A \). In compass directions, "due East" corresponds to a true bearing of \( 090^\circ \). This is a standard convention in navigation and geometry.

#### Step 2.2: Confirm Using Angle Information
- The angle \( \angle BAC = 49^\circ \) is the angle between the line \( AB \) and the line \( AC \). However, this angle does not affect the true bearing of \( B \) from \( A \) because the true bearing is determined by the direction of \( AB \), not its relationship with \( AC \).
- Similarly, the angle \( \angle ABC = 41^\circ \) is the angle between the lines \( AB \) and \( BC \). Again, this angle does not influence the true bearing of \( B \) from \( A \).

#### Step 2.3: Conclude the True Bearing
- Since point \( B \) is explicitly stated to be due East of point \( A \), the true bearing of \( B \) from \( A \) is \( 090^\circ \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The true bearing of point \( B \) from point \( A \) is \( 090^\circ \). This matches choice A.
