QUESTION:
The production process of paper umbrellas in our country is very ingenious. As shown in the figure, whether the umbrella is opened or closed, the handle AP always bisects the angle angle BAC formed by the two ribs in the same plane, and AE = AF, DE = DF, so as to ensure that the umbrella ring can slide along the handle. When a toy umbrella is opened, the BDC is on the same straight line. If AB = 50.0, AD = 14.0, then the area of ​​oil paper required to make such a paper umbrella is (don't remember the seam) ()

CHOICES:
A:48cm^{2}
B:70πcm^{2}
C:2400πcm^{2}
D:2500πcm^{2}

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Visual and Predicate Observations:
1. **Points and Lines:**
   - Points $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, $F$, and $P$ are given.
   - Lines include $AB$, $AC$, $AD$, $AP$, $BE$, $CF$, $DE$, and $DF$.
   - $AP$ is the handle of the umbrella, and it bisects $\angle BAC$.
   - $B$, $D$, and $C$ lie on the same straight line when the umbrella is open.

2. **Geometric Relationships:**
   - $AE = AF$ and $DE = DF$: This implies that $\triangle ADE \cong \triangle ADF$ by SSS congruence.
   - $AP$ bisects $\angle BAC$: By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $AP$ divides $\angle BAC$ into two equal angles.
   - $\triangle ADE$ and $\triangle ADF$ are isosceles triangles.

3. **Measurements:**
   - $AB = 50.0$
   - $AD = 14.0$

4. **Objective:**
   - Calculate the area of the oil paper required for the umbrella. Since the umbrella is symmetric and $AP$ bisects $\angle BAC$, the area will be determined by the sector formed by one half of the umbrella.

#### Spatial Interpretation:
- The umbrella forms a symmetric structure with $AP$ as the axis of symmetry.
- The length $AB$ represents the radius of the circular arc formed by the ribs $AB$ and $AC$ when the umbrella is fully opened.
- The area of the oil paper corresponds to the area of a sector of a circle with radius $AB = 50.0$.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Symmetry and Geometry
- Since $AP$ bisects $\angle BAC$, the angle $\angle BAC$ is split into two equal parts, $\angle BAD$ and $\angle CAD$.
- The congruence $AE = AF$ and $DE = DF$ ensures that the umbrella's structure is symmetric about the line $AP$.
- The point $D$ lies on the line $BDC$, which means $D$ is the point where the umbrella's ribs intersect the handle.

#### Step 2.2: Calculating the Area of the Sector
- The area of the oil paper corresponds to the area of a full circle (since the umbrella is symmetrical and covers a full $360^\circ$ when opened).
- The radius of the circle is given as $AB = 50.0$.
- The formula for the area of a circle is:
  $$
  \text{Area} = \pi r^2
  $$
  Substituting $r = 50.0$:
  $$
  \text{Area} = \pi (50.0)^2 = 2500\pi
  $$

#### Step 2.3: Verifying the Structure
- The symmetry and congruence conditions ($AE = AF$ and $DE = DF$) ensure that the umbrella's shape is consistent with a full circular sector.
- The fact that $D$ lies on $BDC$ confirms that the umbrella's ribs form a straight line when fully opened, supporting the circular structure.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The area of the oil paper required to make the paper umbrella is $2500\pi$. Therefore, the correct choice is:

$$
\boxed{D}
$$
