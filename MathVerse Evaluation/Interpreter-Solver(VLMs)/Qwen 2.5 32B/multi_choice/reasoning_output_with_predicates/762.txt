### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the problem statement and the given predicates, we can extract the following key information:
1. **Geometric Shapes and Relationships**:
   - $ CDEF $ is a rectangle.
   - $ \triangle CAF $ is a right triangle with $ \angle ACF = 90^\circ $.
   - $ AD \perp DC $, $ DC \perp CF $, $ CF \perp FE $, and $ ED \perp DF $.
   - $ DE \parallel CF $ and $ DC \parallel EF $.

2. **Measurements**:
   - $ LengthOf(Line(C,D)) = 7 $ (i.e., $ CD = 7 $).
   - $ LengthOf(Line(C,F)) = 15 $ (i.e., $ CF = 15 $).

3. **Key Condition**:
   - The area of $ \triangle CAF $ is equal to the area of rectangle $ CDEF $.

4. **What We Need to Find**:
   - The length of segment $ AD $.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Calculate the Area of Rectangle $ CDEF $**
The area of rectangle $ CDEF $ is given by:
$$
\text{Area of } CDEF = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = CD \times CF = 7 \times 15 = 105.
$$

#### **Step 2.2: Express the Area of Triangle $ \triangle CAF $**
The area of $ \triangle CAF $ is given by:
$$
\text{Area of } \triangle CAF = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}.
$$
Here, the base of the triangle is $ CF = 15 $, and the height is the vertical distance from point $ A $ to line $ CF $, which is the length of $ AD $. Let $ AD = h $. Then:
$$
\text{Area of } \triangle CAF = \frac{1}{2} \times CF \times AD = \frac{1}{2} \times 15 \times h = \frac{15h}{2}.
$$

#### **Step 2.3: Equate the Areas**
According to the problem, the area of $ \triangle CAF $ is equal to the area of rectangle $ CDEF $. Therefore:
$$
\frac{15h}{2} = 105.
$$

#### **Step 2.4: Solve for $ h $**
To find $ h $, solve the equation:
$$
\frac{15h}{2} = 105.
$$
Multiply both sides by 2:
$$
15h = 210.
$$
Divide both sides by 15:
$$
h = \frac{210}{15} = 14.
$$

Thus, the length of segment $ AD $ is $ 14 $.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The length of segment $ AD $ is $ 14 $. However, this value does not match any of the given choices. Upon re-evaluating the problem and ensuring all steps are correct, it appears there may be a discrepancy between the derived solution and the provided options. Since the problem specifies that the area of the triangle equals the area of the rectangle, and the calculations are consistent with this condition, the correct answer should align with the derived value.

Given the options:
- A. $ 7/2 $
- B. $ 5 $
- C. $ 7 $
- D. $ 15/2 $
- E. $ 15 $

None of these match $ 14 $. However, if we consider possible rounding or interpretation errors, the closest option to $ 14 $ is not listed. Thus, the problem may contain an error in the choices provided.

Final Answer: None of the provided choices match the correct answer $ 14 $. However, if forced to select from the given options, none are correct. 

Since the problem requires a selection from the given choices, and none are valid, I will conclude based on the closest logical interpretation or re-evaluation of the problem's constraints. If the problem's constraints are strictly followed, the answer is not among the choices. 

Final Answer: None of the provided choices are correct. If forced to select, the problem may need reevaluation.
