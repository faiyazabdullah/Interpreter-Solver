FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The figure consists of a sector of a circle and a square.
- The sector is formed by two radii of a circle and an arc.
- The square is inscribed such that one of its sides lies along one of the radii of the sector.

#### Predicates:
1. **Circle(C)**: There is a circle centered at point \( C \).
2. **IsRadiusOf(Line(A,C), Circle(C))**: Line \( AC \) is a radius of the circle.
3. **IsRadiusOf(Line(B,C), Circle(C))**: Line \( BC \) is a radius of the circle.
4. **LengthOf(Line(A,C), 11)**: The length of radius \( AC \) is 11 meters.
5. **LengthOf(Line(B,C), 11)**: The length of radius \( BC \) is 11 meters.
6. **Equals(LengthOf(Line(A,C)), LengthOf(Line(B,C)))**: Both radii have equal lengths.
7. **Perpendicular(Line(A,C), Line(B,C))**: Radii \( AC \) and \( BC \) are perpendicular to each other.
8. **RightAngle(Angle(A,C,B))**: The angle between radii \( AC \) and \( BC \) is a right angle (\( 90^\circ \)).
9. **Arc(A,B)**: There is an arc connecting points \( A \) and \( B \).
10. **Sector(C,A,B)**: The figure includes a sector of the circle with center \( C \) and radii \( AC \) and \( BC \).
11. **Square(S)**: There is a square inscribed in the sector.
12. **AreaOf(S)**: We need to calculate the area of the square.
13. **AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B))**: We need to calculate the area of the sector.
14. **Sub(AreaOf(Sector(C,A,B)), AreaOf(S))**: The area of the shaded region is the difference between the area of the sector and the area of the square.

#### Key Measurements and Relationships:
- Radius of the circle: \( r = 11 \) meters.
- Angle subtended by the sector: \( \theta = 90^\circ \).
- The square is inscribed such that one of its sides lies along radius \( AC \).

#### Goal:
Find the area of the shaded region, which is the difference between the area of the sector and the area of the square.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Area of the Sector
The formula for the area of a sector is:
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi r^2
\]
Here, \( \theta = 90^\circ \) and \( r = 11 \):
\[
\text{Area of sector} = \frac{90^\circ}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi \cdot 11^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \pi \cdot 121 = \frac{121\pi}{4}
\]

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Side Length of the Square
The square is inscribed such that one of its sides lies along radius \( AC \). Let the side length of the square be \( s \). Since the square is inscribed and one of its vertices lies on the arc, the diagonal of the square will be equal to the radius of the circle.

The diagonal of a square with side length \( s \) is given by:
\[
\text{Diagonal} = s\sqrt{2}
\]
Since the diagonal is equal to the radius of the circle:
\[
s\sqrt{2} = 11 \implies s = \frac{11}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{11\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Area of the Square
The area of the square is:
\[
\text{Area of square} = s^2 = \left( \frac{11\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{121 \cdot 2}{4} = \frac{242}{4} = 60.5
\]

#### Step 2.4: Calculate the Area of the Shaded Region
The area of the shaded region is the difference between the area of the sector and the area of the square:
\[
\text{Area of shaded region} = \text{Area of sector} - \text{Area of square} = \frac{121\pi}{4} - 60.5
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The area of the shaded region is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{121\pi}{4} - 60.5}
\]
