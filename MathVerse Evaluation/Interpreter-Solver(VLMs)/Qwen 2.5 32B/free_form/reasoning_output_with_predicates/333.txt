### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Elements:
1. **Points**: \( P \), \( M \), \( S \).
2. **Lines**: Line \( MP \) and line \( MS \).
3. **Angles**: Angle \( \angle PMS \) is labeled as \( 37^\circ \).
4. **Special Construction**: Circle centered at \( M \) with \( M \) lying on it.
5. **Cardinal Point**: \( S \) is denoted as the south cardinal point.

#### Formal Predicates:
- **Points**: \( \text{Point}(P) \), \( \text{Point}(M) \), \( \text{Point}(S) \).
- **Lines**: \( \text{Line}(M, P) \), \( \text{Line}(M, S) \).
- **Angle Measures**:
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(P, M, S)) = 37^\circ \).
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(S, M, P)) = 37^\circ \).
  - \( \text{MeasureOf}(\text{Angle}(PMS)) = 37^\circ \).
- **Circle**: \( \text{Red}(\text{Circle}(M)) \), \( \text{PointLiesOnCircle}(M, \text{Circle}(M)) \).

#### Key Observations:
- The angle \( \angle PMS = 37^\circ \) is given.
- \( S \) is the south cardinal point, meaning the line \( MS \) points directly south.
- The problem asks for the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding Bearings
- **True Bearing**: True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.
- Since \( S \) is the south cardinal point, the line \( MS \) is aligned with the south direction.
- The angle \( \angle PMS = 37^\circ \) indicates that the line \( MP \) is rotated \( 37^\circ \) counterclockwise from the south direction.

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Direction of \( MP \)
- If \( MS \) is south, then moving counterclockwise from south means moving toward the west.
- Therefore, the line \( MP \) is \( 37^\circ \) west of south.

#### Step 2.3: Convert to True Bearing
- True bearing is measured clockwise from north.
- Starting from north:
  1. Move \( 90^\circ \) clockwise to reach east.
  2. Move an additional \( 90^\circ \) clockwise to reach south.
  3. From south, move \( 37^\circ \) counterclockwise to reach the direction of \( MP \).

Thus, the total clockwise rotation from north is:
\[
90^\circ + 90^\circ - 37^\circ = 143^\circ
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify Consistency
- The angle \( \angle PMS = 37^\circ \) is consistent with the geometric configuration.
- The true bearing calculation aligns with the given angle and the direction of \( S \).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \) is \( 143^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{143^\circ}
\]
