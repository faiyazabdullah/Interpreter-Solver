QUESTION:

Hence state the equation of $g(x)$.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are given two logarithmic functions:
1. \( f(x) = \ln x \), which passes through the point \((1, 0)\).
2. \( g(x) \), which is a transformation of \( f(x) \) and passes through the point \((1, 4)\).

The task is to determine the equation of \( g(x) \).

#### Key Observations:
- The function \( f(x) = \ln x \) is a standard logarithmic function.
- The function \( g(x) \) is described as a transformation of \( f(x) \). Since \( g(x) \) passes through \((1, 4)\) while \( f(x) \) passes through \((1, 0)\), this suggests a vertical shift.
- From the given predicates, we know that \( g(x) = \ln x + 3 \).

#### Step-by-Step Deduction:

1. **Identify the form of \( g(x) \):**
   - The general form of a transformed logarithmic function is \( g(x) = \ln x + c \), where \( c \) is a constant representing a vertical shift.
   - We need to determine the value of \( c \).

2. **Use the point \((1, 4)\) to find \( c \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 4 \) into the equation \( g(x) = \ln x + c \):
     \[
     g(1) = \ln(1) + c
     \]
   - Since \( \ln(1) = 0 \):
     \[
     g(1) = 0 + c = c
     \]
   - Given that \( g(1) = 4 \):
     \[
     c = 4
     \]

3. **Write the equation of \( g(x) \):**
   - Substituting \( c = 4 \) into the general form \( g(x) = \ln x + c \):
     \[
     g(x) = \ln x + 4
     \]

4. **Verify the result:**
   - Check if \( g(x) = \ln x + 4 \) satisfies the condition \( g(1) = 4 \):
     \[
     g(1) = \ln(1) + 4 = 0 + 4 = 4
     \]
   - This confirms that the equation is correct.

### Conclusion:
The equation of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
\boxed{g(x) = \ln x + 4}
\]
