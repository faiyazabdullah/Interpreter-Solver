QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The blue curve \( f(x) \) is a parabola given by \( y = x^2 \).
- The red curve \( g(x) \) is a transformed version of \( f(x) \). It appears to be shifted vertically downward.
- The vertex of \( f(x) \) is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \((0, -2)\).

#### From Predicates:
1. **Shape(f)** and **Parabola(f)** indicate that \( f(x) \) is a parabola.
2. **Shape(g)** and **Parabola(g)** indicate that \( g(x) \) is also a parabola.
3. **Equals(f, Pow(x,2))** specifies that \( f(x) = x^2 \).
4. **VerticalTranslation(g, f)** indicates that \( g(x) \) is a vertical translation of \( f(x) \).
5. **IsVertexOf(Point(A), f)** and **Equals(A, (0, 0))** confirm that the vertex of \( f(x) \) is at \((0, 0)\).
6. **IsVertexOf(Point(B), g)** and **Equals(B, (0, -2))** confirm that the vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \((0, -2)\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Equation of \( f(x) \)
From the predicate **Equals(f, Pow(x,2))**, we know:
\[
f(x) = x^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Understanding Vertical Translation
A vertical translation of a function \( f(x) \) by \( k \) units downward is given by:
\[
g(x) = f(x) - k
\]
Here, \( k \) is the vertical distance between the vertices of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

#### Step 2.3: Determining the Vertical Shift
- The vertex of \( f(x) \) is at \((0, 0)\).
- The vertex of \( g(x) \) is at \((0, -2)\).
- The vertical distance between these vertices is:
\[
k = 0 - (-2) = 2
\]
Thus, \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) downward by 2 units.

#### Step 2.4: Equation of \( g(x) \)
Using the vertical translation formula:
\[
g(x) = f(x) - 2
\]
Substitute \( f(x) = x^2 \):
\[
g(x) = x^2 - 2
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The equation for \( g(x) \) is:
\[
g(x) = x^2 - 2
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{g(x) = x^2 - 2}
\]
