### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The geometric figure is a cone.
- The base of the cone is a circle.
- The slant height of the cone is labeled as \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
- The radius of the circular base is labeled as \(3 \, \text{cm}\).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Shape(Cone(1))**: The figure is a cone.
2. **Circle(2)**: There is a circle involved.
3. **IsBaseOf(Circle(2), Cone(1))**: The circle serves as the base of the cone.
4. **LengthOf(radius) = 3**: The radius of the base circle is \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
5. **IsRadiusOf(radius, Circle(2))**: The radius belongs to the base circle.
6. **LengthOf(slantHeight) = 10**: The slant height of the cone is \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
7. **IsSlantHeightOf(slantHeight, Cone(1))**: The slant height is associated with the cone.

#### Key Measurements:
- Radius (\(r\)) of the base circle: \(3 \, \text{cm}\).
- Slant height (\(l\)) of the cone: \(10 \, \text{cm}\).

#### What We Need to Find:
The surface area of the cone. The surface area of a cone consists of two parts:
1. **Lateral Surface Area**: The curved surface area of the cone.
2. **Base Area**: The area of the circular base.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Formula for the Surface Area of a Cone:
The total surface area \(A\) of a cone is given by:
\[
A = \text{Lateral Surface Area} + \text{Base Area}
\]
where:
1. **Lateral Surface Area**: \( \pi r l \)
2. **Base Area**: \( \pi r^2 \)

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Lateral Surface Area
The lateral surface area of a cone is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi r l
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
r = 3 \, \text{cm}, \quad l = 10 \, \text{cm}
\]
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = \pi (3)(10) = 30\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Base Area
The base area of the cone is the area of the circular base, given by:
\[
\text{Base Area} = \pi r^2
\]
Substitute the given value:
\[
r = 3 \, \text{cm}
\]
\[
\text{Base Area} = \pi (3)^2 = 9\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Total Surface Area
The total surface area is the sum of the lateral surface area and the base area:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area} + \text{Base Area}
\]
Substitute the calculated values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 30\pi + 9\pi = 39\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 2.4: Approximate the Numerical Value
Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 39 \times 3.14159 = 122.52301 \, \text{cm}^2
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 122.52 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the cone is:
\[
\boxed{122.52 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
