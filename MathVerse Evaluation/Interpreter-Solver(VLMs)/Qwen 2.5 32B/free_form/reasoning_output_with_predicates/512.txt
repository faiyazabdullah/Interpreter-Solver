### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the inequality that describes the shaded region in the given Cartesian coordinate plane. Here's the systematic breakdown:

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
1. **Image Observations:**
   - The image shows a dashed line passing through the origin.
   - The line appears to have a negative slope.
   - The shaded region lies **above** the dashed line (in the upper-left quadrant relative to the line).

2. **Predicates Analysis:**
   - **Point(Origin):** The origin is at \((0, 0)\).
   - **PointLiesOnLine(Origin, Line):** The line passes through the origin.
   - **Shaded(Region):** The shaded region is above the line.
   - **Line(Line):** The line has a specific equation.
   - **PointLiesOnLine(Point1, Line):** Points on the line satisfy the line's equation.
   - **Perpendicular(Xaxis, Yaxis):** The axes are perpendicular.
   - **IsOriginOf(Origin, Xaxis, Yaxis):** The origin is the intersection of the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis.

3. **Key Relationships:**
   - The line passes through the origin, so its equation can be written as \(y = mx\), where \(m\) is the slope.
   - The shaded region lies above the line, meaning all points \((x, y)\) in the shaded region satisfy \(y > mx\).

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Substep 2.1: Determine the Slope of the Line**
- From the image, the line passes through the origin and another point approximately at \((-4, 2)\).
- The slope \(m\) of the line is given by:
  \[
  m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{2 - 0}{-4 - 0} = \frac{2}{-4} = -\frac{1}{2}
  \]
- Therefore, the equation of the line is:
  \[
  y = -\frac{1}{2}x
  \]

##### **Substep 2.2: Define the Shaded Region**
- The shaded region lies **above** the line \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x\). This means that for any point \((x, y)\) in the shaded region, the \(y\)-coordinate must be greater than the \(y\)-coordinate on the line at the same \(x\)-value.
- Mathematically, this is expressed as:
  \[
  y > -\frac{1}{2}x
  \]

##### **Substep 2.3: Verify the Inequality**
- The shaded region does not include the line itself (since it is a dashed line), confirming that the inequality is strict (\(>\)) rather than non-strict (\(\geq\)).
- The inequality \(y > -\frac{1}{2}x\) correctly describes all points above the line.

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
The inequality that describes the shaded region is:
\[
y > -\frac{1}{2}x
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y > -\frac{1}{2}x}
\]
