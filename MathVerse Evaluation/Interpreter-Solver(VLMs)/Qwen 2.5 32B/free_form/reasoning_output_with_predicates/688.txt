FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Inspection of the Image:
- The image depicts a half-cylinder.
- The base of the half-cylinder is a semicircle.
- The height of the half-cylinder is given as 9 cm.
- The diameter of the base is given as 6 cm.

#### Key Measurements and Predicates:
From the given predicates:
1. **Shape**: HalfCylinder
2. **Diameter of Base**: 6 cm
3. **Height of HalfCylinder**: 9 cm
4. **Radius of Base**: \( \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) cm

#### Question Requirements:
We are tasked with calculating the volume of the half-cylinder, correct to one decimal place.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Volume of a Full Cylinder:
The formula for the volume of a full cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

#### Volume of a Half-Cylinder:
Since the given shape is a half-cylinder, its volume will be half the volume of a full cylinder with the same base and height. Therefore:
\[
V_{\text{half-cylinder}} = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{cylinder}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 h
\]

#### Substituting Known Values:
From the predicates:
- Radius \( r = 3 \) cm,
- Height \( h = 9 \) cm.

Substitute these values into the formula for the volume of the half-cylinder:
\[
V_{\text{half-cylinder}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (3)^2 (9)
\]

#### Simplify the Expression:
1. Calculate \( r^2 \):
\[
r^2 = 3^2 = 9
\]

2. Multiply by the height \( h \):
\[
r^2 h = 9 \cdot 9 = 81
\]

3. Multiply by \( \frac{1}{2} \pi \):
\[
V_{\text{half-cylinder}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 81 = \frac{81\pi}{2}
\]

#### Numerical Calculation:
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
V_{\text{half-cylinder}} = \frac{81 \cdot 3.14159}{2} = \frac{254.46939}{2} = 127.234695
\]

Round to one decimal place:
\[
V_{\text{half-cylinder}} \approx 127.2 \text{ cm}^3
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of the half-cylinder, correct to one decimal place, is:
\[
\boxed{127.2 \text{ cm}^3}
\]
