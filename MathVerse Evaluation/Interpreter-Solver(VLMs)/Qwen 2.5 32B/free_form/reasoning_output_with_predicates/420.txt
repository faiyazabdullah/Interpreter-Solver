FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the length of the missing side of a trapezium. The given information includes:
1. One base of the trapezium is \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
2. The height (perpendicular distance between the bases) is \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
3. The trapezium has one visible side of \(10 \, \text{cm}\), which is not the height.

We need to determine the length of the other non-parallel side (the missing side).

---

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
- The figure is a trapezium with one base labeled as \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
- The height of the trapezium is \(6 \, \text{cm}\), indicated by the perpendicular line.
- The visible non-parallel side is also \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
- We need to find the length of the other non-parallel side.

Key observations:
- The trapezium has two parallel sides (bases) and two non-parallel sides.
- The height is perpendicular to both bases, forming right triangles when extended.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Define Variables and Known Quantities**
Let the trapezium be denoted as \(ABCD\) where:
- \(AB\) and \(CD\) are the parallel sides (bases), with \(AB = 10 \, \text{cm}\).
- The height is \(EF = 6 \, \text{cm}\), where \(E\) is on \(AB\) and \(F\) is on \(CD\).
- One non-parallel side \(AD = 10 \, \text{cm}\).
- The other non-parallel side \(BC\) is the unknown we need to find.

#### **Step 2.2: Analyze the Right Triangles**
The height \(EF\) divides the trapezium into two right triangles and a rectangle:
1. Right triangle \( \triangle ADE \): With \(AE\) as one leg, \(DE\) as the other leg, and \(AD\) as the hypotenuse.
2. Right triangle \( \triangle BCF \): With \(BF\) as one leg, \(CF\) as the other leg, and \(BC\) as the hypotenuse.

Since \(EF\) is perpendicular to both bases, \(EF = 6 \, \text{cm}\) is the height of both right triangles.

#### **Step 2.3: Determine the Length of \(CF\)**
Let the length of the longer base \(CD\) be \(x \, \text{cm}\). Since \(EF\) is the height, the segment \(CF\) (part of the longer base) can be determined by subtracting the overlapping segment from the total length of \(CD\).

From the image, the trapezium is symmetric about its height, so:
\[ CF = \frac{x - AB}{2} = \frac{x - 10}{2} \]

#### **Step 2.4: Use the Pythagorean Theorem**
In \( \triangle BCF \):
- The height \(BF = 6 \, \text{cm}\).
- The base \(CF = \frac{x - 10}{2}\).
- The hypotenuse \(BC\) is the unknown side we need to find.

By the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
BC^2 = BF^2 + CF^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
BC^2 = 6^2 + \left( \frac{x - 10}{2} \right)^2
\]
\[
BC^2 = 36 + \left( \frac{x - 10}{2} \right)^2
\]

#### **Step 2.5: Use Symmetry and Known Side Length**
Since the trapezium is symmetric and one non-parallel side \(AD = 10 \, \text{cm}\), we can infer that the other non-parallel side \(BC\) will have the same length due to symmetry. Therefore:
\[
BC = 10 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### **Step 2.6: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \(BC = 10 \, \text{cm}\) back into the equation:
\[
10^2 = 6^2 + \left( \frac{x - 10}{2} \right)^2
\]
\[
100 = 36 + \left( \frac{x - 10}{2} \right)^2
\]
\[
64 = \left( \frac{x - 10}{2} \right)^2
\]
\[
\frac{x - 10}{2} = \pm 8
\]
Since \(x\) must be positive:
\[
\frac{x - 10}{2} = 8
\]
\[
x - 10 = 16
\]
\[
x = 26
\]

Thus, the length of the longer base \(CD\) is \(26 \, \text{cm}\), and the missing side \(BC\) is indeed \(10 \, \text{cm}\).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The length of the missing side of the trapezium is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
