QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It intersects its midline at $(-3.5,-0.8)$, and it has a maximum point at $(4.1,0.7)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given image and predicates, we analyze the following key points:
1. **Midline Intersection Point**: The function intersects its midline at the point $(-3.5, -0.8)$. This means that the y-coordinate of this point corresponds to the midline of the function.
   - Predicate: $Equals(A, (-3.5, -0.8))$.
2. **Maximum Point**: The function reaches its maximum at the point $(4.1, 0.7)$. This is the highest point on the graph.
   - Predicate: $Equals(B, (4.1, 0.7))$.
3. **Trigonometric Function**: The graph depicts a sinusoidal function, which oscillates above and below its midline.
4. **Amplitude Definition**: The amplitude of a trigonometric function is the distance from the midline to the maximum (or minimum) point. Mathematically, it is half the vertical distance between the maximum and minimum values of the function.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify the Midline
- The midline is the horizontal line that passes through the midpoint of the maximum and minimum values of the function. Since the function intersects the midline at $(-3.5, -0.8)$, the y-coordinate of the midline is $-0.8$.
  - Midline equation: $y = -0.8$.

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Maximum Point
- The maximum point is given as $(4.1, 0.7)$. The y-coordinate of this point is $0.7$.

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Amplitude
- The amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline to the maximum point. This distance is simply the difference between the y-coordinate of the maximum point and the y-coordinate of the midline.
  - Amplitude = $|0.7 - (-0.8)| = |0.7 + 0.8| = 1.5$.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The amplitude of the function is the distance from the midline to the maximum point, which we have calculated to be $1.5$.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1.5}
\]
