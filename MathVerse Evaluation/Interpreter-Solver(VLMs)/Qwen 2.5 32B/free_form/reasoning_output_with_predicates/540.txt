### Problem Analysis:
We are given a trigonometric function whose graph is shown. The function intersects its midline at the point \( (1.25, -2.75) \) and has a minimum point at \( (4.75, -6.25) \). We need to determine the period of the function.

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
1. **Midline Intersection Point**:
   - The function intersects its midline at \( (1.25, -2.75) \).
   - This means the y-coordinate of the midline is \( -2.75 \).

2. **Minimum Point**:
   - The function has a minimum point at \( (4.75, -6.25) \).
   - The y-coordinate of the minimum point is \( -6.25 \).

3. **Amplitude**:
   - The amplitude is half the vertical distance between the maximum and minimum points.
   - From the midline to the minimum point, the vertical distance is \( |-6.25 - (-2.75)| = |-6.25 + 2.75| = 3.5 \).
   - Therefore, the amplitude is \( \frac{3.5}{2} = 1.75 \).

4. **Period**:
   - The period of a trigonometric function is the horizontal distance between two consecutive identical points (e.g., two consecutive midline intersections or two consecutive maximum points).

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Midline**:
   - The midline is the horizontal line \( y = -2.75 \).

2. **Determine the Phase Shift and Period**:
   - The function intersects the midline at \( (1.25, -2.75) \).
   - The next intersection with the midline occurs after completing one full cycle.
   - Since the function is periodic, the next midline intersection will occur at a horizontal distance equal to the period from the first midline intersection.

3. **Use the Minimum Point to Find the Period**:
   - The minimum point is at \( (4.75, -6.25) \).
   - The minimum point is halfway between two consecutive midline intersections.
   - Therefore, the horizontal distance from \( (1.25, -2.75) \) to \( (4.75, -6.25) \) is half the period.
   - The horizontal distance between these points is:
     \[
     4.75 - 1.25 = 3.5
     \]
   - Since this is half the period, the full period \( T \) is:
     \[
     T = 2 \times 3.5 = 7
     \]

#### Step 3: Conclusion
The period of the function is \( 7 \) units.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
