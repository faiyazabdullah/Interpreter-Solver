QUESTION:
Consider the point A. The angle between line OA and the south direction is 32Â°.

What is the true bearing of A from O?

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The image shows a compass-like structure with cardinal directions (North, South, East, West).
- Point \( O \) is at the origin.
- Point \( A \) lies in the fourth quadrant.
- The angle between the line \( OA \) and the south direction is marked as \( 32^\circ \).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Points and Lines:**
   - Points \( A \) and \( O \) are defined.
   - Lines \( OA \), \( ON \) (North), \( OS \) (South), \( OE \) (East), and \( OW \) (West) are defined.
   - Point \( O \) lies on all these lines (origin).

2. **Angle Measurement:**
   - The angle \( \angle(A, O, \text{South}) \) is given as \( 32^\circ \).

3. **Key Relationships:**
   - The angle \( \angle(A, O, \text{South}) \) indicates the angular deviation of \( OA \) from the south direction.
   - The bearing of \( A \) from \( O \) is measured clockwise from the north direction.

#### Specific Value Requested:
- The question asks for the **true bearing** of point \( A \) from point \( O \). True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Angle \( \angle(A, O, \text{South}) \)
- The angle \( \angle(A, O, \text{South}) = 32^\circ \) means that the line \( OA \) forms a \( 32^\circ \) angle with the south direction, measured counterclockwise from the south direction toward \( OA \).

#### Step 2.2: Converting to Bearing
- True bearing is measured **clockwise** from the north direction.
- To find the true bearing, we need to determine the angle between the north direction and the line \( OA \).

#### Step 2.3: Relating the Angle to the North Direction
- The south direction is directly opposite the north direction, so it is \( 180^\circ \) from the north.
- Since \( \angle(A, O, \text{South}) = 32^\circ \), the angle between the north direction and \( OA \) can be calculated as follows:
  - The total angle from the north to the south is \( 180^\circ \).
  - Moving \( 32^\circ \) counterclockwise from the south corresponds to moving \( 180^\circ - 32^\circ = 148^\circ \) clockwise from the north.

#### Step 2.4: Final Calculation
- Therefore, the true bearing of \( A \) from \( O \) is \( 148^\circ \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( O \) is \( 148^\circ \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{148^\circ}\]
