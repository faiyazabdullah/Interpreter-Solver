QUESTION:
The graph shows the number of earthquakes in a particular country. The x-axis represents years, and the y-axis represents the number of earthquakes.

What is the average rate of change?

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Image:
- The graph shows a horizontal line at \( y = 6 \).
- The x-axis represents the year, ranging from 1 to 4.
- The y-axis represents the number of earthquakes, ranging from 0 to 10.
- The points on the graph are plotted at \((1, 6)\), \((2, 6)\), \((3, 6)\), and \((4, 6)\).

#### Formal Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(1), Line(0,6))**: Point \((1, 6)\) lies on the line \( y = 6 \).
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(2), Line(0,6))**: Point \((2, 6)\) lies on the line \( y = 6 \).
3. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(3), Line(0,6))**: Point \((3, 6)\) lies on the line \( y = 6 \).
4. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(4), Line(0,6))**: Point \((4, 6)\) lies on the line \( y = 6 \).
5. **LengthOf(Line(0,6))**: The length of the line segment from \( (1, 6) \) to \( (4, 6) \) is 6 units.
6. **Equals(LengthOf(Line(0,6)), 6)**: The length of the line segment is equal to 6 units.

#### Key Observations:
- The graph shows a constant value of 6 for the number of earthquakes across all years.
- The line is horizontal, indicating no change in the number of earthquakes over time.

#### Question:
We are asked to find the **average rate of change** of the number of earthquakes over the given years.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Definition of Average Rate of Change:
The average rate of change of a function \( f(x) \) over an interval \([a, b]\) is given by:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a}
\]
Here, \( f(x) \) represents the number of earthquakes, and \( x \) represents the year.

#### Applying the Formula:
From the graph:
- \( f(1) = 6 \) (number of earthquakes in year 1),
- \( f(2) = 6 \) (number of earthquakes in year 2),
- \( f(3) = 6 \) (number of earthquakes in year 3),
- \( f(4) = 6 \) (number of earthquakes in year 4).

We can calculate the average rate of change over any interval. Letâ€™s choose the interval from year 1 to year 4 for completeness:
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{f(4) - f(1)}{4 - 1}
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
f(4) = 6, \quad f(1) = 6, \quad b = 4, \quad a = 1
\]
\[
\text{Average Rate of Change} = \frac{6 - 6}{4 - 1} = \frac{0}{3} = 0
\]

#### Justification:
The function \( f(x) = 6 \) is a constant function, meaning the number of earthquakes does not change over time. Therefore, the numerator \( f(b) - f(a) \) is always zero, resulting in an average rate of change of 0.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The average rate of change of the number of earthquakes over the given years is \( 0 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{0}\]
