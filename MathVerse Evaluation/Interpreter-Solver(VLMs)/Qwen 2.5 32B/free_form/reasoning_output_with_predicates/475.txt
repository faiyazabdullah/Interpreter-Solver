QUESTION:
There is a point at 4 and a blue arrow goes to left from that point. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The image depicts a number line with a point labeled "4".
- There is a blue arrow extending to the left from the point at 4. This indicates that the direction of interest is towards negative infinity, starting from 4.

#### Predicates:
1. **Point(4)**: There is a point on the number line at position 4.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(4), Line($1$, $2$))**: The point at 4 lies on the number line.
3. **Blue(Line($3$, $4$))**: The line segment or arrow extending from the point at 4 is blue.
4. **LengthOf(Line($3$, $4$))**: The length of the blue arrow is unspecified but irrelevant since it extends indefinitely to the left.

#### Key Observations:
- The blue arrow indicates a direction toward negative infinity.
- The point at 4 serves as the endpoint of the arrow's direction.
- The set of numbers represented includes all real numbers less than or equal to 4.

#### Question Restatement:
We need to represent the set of numbers on the number line in interval notation, based on the given visual and predicate information.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Interpret the Blue Arrow
- The blue arrow starts at the point 4 and extends to the left. In the context of a number line:
  - Extending to the left means moving toward smaller numbers.
  - Since the arrow does not have an endpoint (it extends indefinitely), it represents all numbers less than 4.

#### Step 2.2: Include the Point at 4
- The point at 4 is included in the set because the arrow originates from this point. Therefore, the set includes 4 itself.

#### Step 2.3: Represent the Set in Interval Notation
- The set of all real numbers less than or equal to 4 is denoted in interval notation as:
  \[
  (-\infty, 4]
  \]
  - The parenthesis "(" indicates that negative infinity is not included (since it is not a real number).
  - The square bracket "]" indicates that 4 is included in the set.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The set of numbers represented on the number line, based on the given visual and predicate information, is:
\[
(-\infty, 4]
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(-\infty, 4]}
\]
