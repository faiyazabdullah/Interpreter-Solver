QUESTION:
Write an equation for the transformation of f(x)=|x| as shown in the figure, which passes (3, 3) and are piecewise.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The graph shows a V-shaped figure that resembles the absolute value function \( f(x) = |x| \).
- The vertex of the V-shape is at \( (3, 3) \).
- The figure is symmetric about the vertical line \( x = 3 \).
- The points \( (2, -1) \) and \( (4, -1) \) lie on the figure, indicating the endpoints of the V-shape.

#### Predicates:
- **Points and Lines**:
  - Points \( A(2, -1) \), \( B(3, 3) \), and \( C(4, -1) \) are defined.
  - Point \( B \) is the vertex, and it lies on the lines connecting \( A \) and \( C \).
  - The figure is symmetric about \( x = 3 \).

- **Transformations**:
  - The function \( f(x) = |x| \) is transformed to fit the given points.
  - The vertex of the V-shape is at \( (3, 3) \), indicating a horizontal and vertical shift.

#### Key Measurements:
- The vertex of the V-shape is at \( (3, 3) \).
- The figure passes through the points \( (2, -1) \) and \( (4, -1) \).

#### Specific Request:
- Write the equation for the transformation of \( f(x) = |x| \) as shown in the figure, which is piecewise.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understand the Original Function
The original function is \( f(x) = |x| \). This function has a vertex at \( (0, 0) \) and is symmetric about the y-axis. The general form of the absolute value function is:
\[
f(x) = |x|
\]

#### Step 2.2: Identify Horizontal and Vertical Shifts
From the figure, the vertex of the V-shape is at \( (3, 3) \). This indicates two transformations:
1. **Horizontal shift**: The vertex moves from \( (0, 0) \) to \( (3, 0) \), which corresponds to a horizontal shift of 3 units to the right.
   - This is achieved by replacing \( x \) with \( x - 3 \) in the function.
2. **Vertical shift**: The vertex moves from \( (3, 0) \) to \( (3, 3) \), which corresponds to a vertical shift of 3 units up.
   - This is achieved by adding 3 to the function.

Thus, the transformed function before scaling is:
\[
f(x) = |x - 3| + 3
\]

#### Step 2.3: Determine Scaling
The figure shows that the V-shape passes through the points \( (2, -1) \) and \( (4, -1) \). We need to determine if there is any scaling involved.

- At \( x = 2 \):
  \[
  f(2) = |2 - 3| + 3 = |-1| + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \quad \text{(but the figure shows } f(2) = -1\text{)}
  \]
  This indicates that the function is scaled vertically by a factor of \( k \).

- At \( x = 4 \):
  \[
  f(4) = |4 - 3| + 3 = |1| + 3 = 1 + 3 = 4 \quad \text{(but the figure shows } f(4) = -1\text{)}
  \]
  Similarly, this indicates a vertical scaling.

To satisfy the condition \( f(2) = -1 \) and \( f(4) = -1 \), we need to scale the function by a negative factor. Let the scaled function be:
\[
f(x) = k|x - 3| + 3
\]
Substitute \( x = 2 \):
\[
f(2) = k|2 - 3| + 3 = k|-1| + 3 = k + 3 = -1
\]
Solve for \( k \):
\[
k + 3 = -1 \implies k = -4
\]

Thus, the scaled function is:
\[
f(x) = -4|x - 3| + 3
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify Symmetry
The function \( f(x) = -4|x - 3| + 3 \) is symmetric about \( x = 3 \), which matches the figure. Additionally, it passes through the points \( (2, -1) \) and \( (4, -1) \):
- At \( x = 2 \):
  \[
  f(2) = -4|2 - 3| + 3 = -4|-1| + 3 = -4(1) + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1
  \]
- At \( x = 4 \):
  \[
  f(4) = -4|4 - 3| + 3 = -4|1| + 3 = -4(1) + 3 = -4 + 3 = -1
  \]

#### Step 2.5: Write the Piecewise Form
The function \( f(x) = -4|x - 3| + 3 \) can be written in piecewise form:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-4(x - 3) + 3 & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
-4(-(x - 3)) + 3 & \text{if } x < 3
\end{cases}
\]
Simplify each case:
- For \( x \geq 3 \):
  \[
  f(x) = -4(x - 3) + 3 = -4x + 12 + 3 = -4x + 15
  \]
- For \( x < 3 \):
  \[
  f(x) = -4(-(x - 3)) + 3 = 4(x - 3) + 3 = 4x - 12 + 3 = 4x - 9
  \]

Thus, the piecewise function is:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-4x + 15 & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
4x - 9 & \text{if } x < 3
\end{cases}
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The final equation for the transformation of \( f(x) = |x| \) as shown in the figure is:
\[
\boxed{
\begin{cases}
-4x + 15 & \text{if } x \geq 3 \\
4x - 9 & \text{if } x < 3
\end{cases}
}
\]
