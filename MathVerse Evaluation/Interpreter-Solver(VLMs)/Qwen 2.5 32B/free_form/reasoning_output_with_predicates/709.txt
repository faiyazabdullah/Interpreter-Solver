### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the surface area of a square pyramid. The given information includes:
1. The side length of the square base is \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
2. The perpendicular height of the pyramid is \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
3. All four triangular faces are congruent.

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- **Base of the Pyramid**: The base is a square with side length \(10 \, \text{cm}\).
- **Height of the Pyramid**: The perpendicular height from the apex to the center of the base is \(6 \, \text{cm}\).
- **Slant Height**: We need to calculate the slant height of the triangular faces, which is the hypotenuse of a right triangle formed by the height of the pyramid, half the side length of the base, and the slant height itself.
- **Surface Area**: The total surface area of the pyramid includes the area of the base and the areas of the four triangular faces.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Calculate the Slant Height**
The slant height (\(l\)) of the triangular faces can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Consider a right triangle formed by:
- The height of the pyramid (\(h = 6 \, \text{cm}\)),
- Half the side length of the base (\(\frac{10}{2} = 5 \, \text{cm}\)),
- The slant height (\(l\)) as the hypotenuse.

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
l = \sqrt{\left(\frac{10}{2}\right)^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{5^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{25 + 36} = \sqrt{61}
\]
Thus, the slant height is:
\[
l = \sqrt{61} \, \text{cm}
\]

#### **Step 2.2: Calculate the Area of One Triangular Face**
Each triangular face is an isosceles triangle with a base of \(10 \, \text{cm}\) and a slant height of \(\sqrt{61} \, \text{cm}\). The area of one triangular face is given by:
\[
\text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{slant height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times \sqrt{61} = 5\sqrt{61} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Since there are four congruent triangular faces, the total area of the four triangular faces is:
\[
\text{Total area of triangular faces} = 4 \times 5\sqrt{61} = 20\sqrt{61} \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Calculate the Area of the Base**
The base is a square with side length \(10 \, \text{cm}\). The area of the base is:
\[
\text{Area of the base} = 10 \times 10 = 100 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### **Step 2.4: Calculate the Total Surface Area**
The total surface area of the pyramid is the sum of the area of the base and the total area of the four triangular faces:
\[
\text{Total surface area} = \text{Area of the base} + \text{Total area of triangular faces} = 100 + 20\sqrt{61}
\]

#### **Step 2.5: Approximate the Result**
We approximate \(\sqrt{61}\):
\[
\sqrt{61} \approx 7.81
\]
Thus:
\[
20\sqrt{61} \approx 20 \times 7.81 = 156.2
\]
So the total surface area is:
\[
\text{Total surface area} \approx 100 + 156.2 = 256.2 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion
The total surface area of the square pyramid, rounded to one decimal place, is:
\[
\boxed{256.2 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
