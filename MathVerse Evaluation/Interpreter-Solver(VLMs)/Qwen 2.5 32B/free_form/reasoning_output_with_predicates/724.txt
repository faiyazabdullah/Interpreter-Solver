### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Image:
- The image depicts a cube.
- One edge of the cube is labeled as \( x + 4 \).

#### Predicates Provided:
1. **Cube(1)**: Indicates that the geometric figure is a cube.
2. **LengthOf(SideOf(1), SumOf(x, 4))**: The length of each side of the cube is \( x + 4 \).
3. **Equals(LengthOf(SideOf(1)), SumOf(x, 4))**: Confirms that the side length of the cube is \( x + 4 \).
4. **Equals(VolumeOf(1), Pow(SumOf(x, 4), 3))**: The volume of the cube is given by the cube of its side length, i.e., \( (x + 4)^3 \).

#### Key Measurements:
- Side length of the cube: \( x + 4 \).

#### Question Asked:
We are asked to find the polynomial that represents the volume of the cube.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Volume of a Cube
- The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
  \[
  V = s^3
  \]
  where \( s \) is the length of a side of the cube.

#### Step 2.2: Substituting the Side Length
- From the predicates and the image, the side length of the cube is \( x + 4 \).
- Therefore, the volume \( V \) of the cube is:
  \[
  V = (x + 4)^3
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Expanding the Polynomial
- To express the volume as a polynomial, we expand \( (x + 4)^3 \):
  \[
  (x + 4)^3 = (x + 4)(x + 4)(x + 4)
  \]
  First, calculate \( (x + 4)(x + 4) \):
  \[
  (x + 4)(x + 4) = x^2 + 8x + 16
  \]
  Next, multiply the result by \( (x + 4) \):
  \[
  (x^2 + 8x + 16)(x + 4) = x^2(x + 4) + 8x(x + 4) + 16(x + 4)
  \]
  Distribute each term:
  \[
  x^2(x + 4) = x^3 + 4x^2
  \]
  \[
  8x(x + 4) = 8x^2 + 32x
  \]
  \[
  16(x + 4) = 16x + 64
  \]
  Combine all terms:
  \[
  x^3 + 4x^2 + 8x^2 + 32x + 16x + 64 = x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 64
  \]

#### Step 2.4: Final Polynomial Expression
- The expanded polynomial representing the volume of the cube is:
  \[
  V = x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 64
  \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The polynomial that represents the volume of the cube is \( x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 64 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{x^3 + 12x^2 + 48x + 64}\]
