QUESTION:
The linear function is graphed. The x-axis represents Time (minutes) and the y-axis represents Water (liters). The slope is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (5,0) and the y-axis at (0,360). Archimedes drained the water in his tub.
The amount of water left in the tub (in liters) as a function of time (in minutes) is graphed.
How much water was initially in the tub?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the initial amount of water in the tub based on the given graph and predicates. The graph depicts a linear relationship between the amount of water (in liters) and time (in minutes). The slope of the line is negative, indicating that the water level is decreasing over time. The line intersects the y-axis at (0, 360) and the x-axis at (5, 0).

#### Key Observations:
1. The y-intercept of the line is at (0, 360). This means when \( t = 0 \) minutes, the amount of water is 360 liters.
2. The x-intercept of the line is at (5, 0). This means when the tub is completely drained, it takes 5 minutes.
3. The slope of the line is negative, confirming that the water level decreases linearly over time.
4. The question asks for the initial amount of water in the tub, which corresponds to the y-intercept.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Interpret the Graph and Predicates**
- From the graph, the y-intercept is at (0, 360). This is visually confirmed by the point where the line crosses the y-axis.
- The predicate `PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,360), Line(A,B))` confirms that the point (0, 360) lies on the line.
- The predicate `Equals(LengthOf(Point0360), 360)` directly states that the length corresponding to Point0360 is 360 units, which aligns with the y-coordinate of the y-intercept.

#### **Step 2: Determine the Initial Amount of Water**
- The initial amount of water in the tub corresponds to the y-intercept of the line, as this represents the water level at time \( t = 0 \).
- From the graph and the predicates, the y-intercept is clearly (0, 360). Therefore, the initial amount of water is 360 liters.

#### **Step 3: Verify Consistency**
- The x-intercept at (5, 0) indicates that the tub is completely drained after 5 minutes. This is consistent with the slope being negative and the line passing through these points.
- The linear nature of the graph and the given predicates support the interpretation that the y-intercept accurately represents the initial condition.

### Conclusion:
The initial amount of water in the tub is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept, which is 360 liters.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{360}\]
