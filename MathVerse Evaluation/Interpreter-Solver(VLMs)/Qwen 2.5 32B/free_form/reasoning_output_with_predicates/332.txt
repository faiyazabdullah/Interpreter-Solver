### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( P \) from point \( M \). The given information includes:
1. Points \( P \), \( M \), and \( S \).
2. Line segments \( MP \) and \( MS \).
3. \( S \) is denoted as the south cardinal point.
4. The measure of \( \angle PMS = 50^\circ \).

From the problem setup:
- The direction \( MS \) is south, as indicated by the downward arrow labeled \( S \).
- The angle \( \angle PMS \) is measured counterclockwise from \( MS \) to \( MP \).

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Reference System**
- In navigation, bearings are measured clockwise from the north direction.
- Since \( S \) is south, the direction \( MS \) is aligned with the south direction.
- The angle \( \angle PMS = 50^\circ \) is measured counterclockwise from \( MS \) to \( MP \).

#### **Step 2: Determine the True Bearing**
- True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.
- To find the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \):
  1. Start at the north direction.
  2. Rotate clockwise to reach the south direction (\( 180^\circ \)).
  3. Continue rotating clockwise an additional \( 50^\circ \) to align with \( MP \).

Thus, the total rotation from the north direction to \( MP \) is:
\[
180^\circ + 50^\circ = 230^\circ
\]

#### **Step 3: Verify the Calculation**
- The angle \( \angle PMS = 50^\circ \) is measured counterclockwise from \( MS \) to \( MP \).
- Since \( MS \) is south, adding this counterclockwise angle to the south direction results in a clockwise rotation from the north direction.
- Therefore, the true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \) is \( 230^\circ \).

### Conclusion:
The true bearing of \( P \) from \( M \) is \( 230^\circ \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{230^\circ}\]
