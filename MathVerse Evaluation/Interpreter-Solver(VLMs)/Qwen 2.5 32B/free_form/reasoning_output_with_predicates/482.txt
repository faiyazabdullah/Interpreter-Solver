### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the domain and range of the function represented by the line segment that passes through two points: a hollow point at \((2, 8)\) and a solid point at \((8, 6)\). The image shows these points and the line segment connecting them. Let us proceed step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

#### From the Image:
- The hollow point is at \((2, 8)\).
- The solid point is at \((8, 6)\).
- The line segment connects these two points.
- The hollow point indicates the endpoint is **not included** in the domain and range.
- The solid point indicates the endpoint is **included** in the domain and range.

#### From Predicates:
- \( \text{Point}(A) \): Point \( A \) exists.
- \( \text{Point}(B) \): Point \( B \) exists.
- \( \text{PointLiesOnLine}(A, \text{Line}(A, B)) \): Point \( A \) lies on the line.
- \( \text{PointLiesOnLine}(B, \text{Line}(A, B)) \): Point \( B \) lies on the line.
- \( \text{Equals}(2, A) \): The \( x \)-coordinate of \( A \) is 2.
- \( \text{Equals}(8, B) \): The \( y \)-coordinate of \( B \) is 8.
- \( \text{Equals}(8, A) \): The \( y \)-coordinate of \( A \) is 8.
- \( \text{Equals}(6, B) \): The \( y \)-coordinate of \( B \) is 6.
- \( \text{Point}(\text{PointA}) \): Point \( A \) is defined.
- \( \text{Point}(\text{PointB}) \): Point \( B \) is defined.
- \( \text{Equals}(\text{PointA}, 2, 8) \): Point \( A \) has coordinates \((2, 8)\).
- \( \text{Equals}(\text{PointB}, 8, 6) \): Point \( B \) has coordinates \((8, 6)\).
- \( \text{Line}(\text{PointA}, \text{PointB}) \): A line is defined through points \( A \) and \( B \).

#### Key Observations:
- The line segment starts at \((2, 8)\) (hollow point, excluded) and ends at \((8, 6)\) (solid point, included).
- The domain corresponds to the \( x \)-coordinates of the points on the line segment.
- The range corresponds to the \( y \)-coordinates of the points on the line segment.

---

### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

#### 1. Determine the Domain:
- The \( x \)-coordinates of the endpoints are \( x_1 = 2 \) (hollow point, excluded) and \( x_2 = 8 \) (solid point, included).
- Since the hollow point excludes its coordinate, the domain starts just after \( x = 2 \).
- The solid point includes its coordinate, so the domain ends at \( x = 8 \).
- Therefore, the domain is:
  \[
  \text{Domain: } (2, 8].
  \]

#### 2. Determine the Range:
- The \( y \)-coordinates of the endpoints are \( y_1 = 8 \) (hollow point, excluded) and \( y_2 = 6 \) (solid point, included).
- Since the hollow point excludes its coordinate, the range starts just after \( y = 8 \).
- The solid point includes its coordinate, so the range ends at \( y = 6 \).
- Therefore, the range is:
  \[
  \text{Range: } (8, 6].
  \]

#### 3. Verify the Line Segment:
- The line segment is continuous between the points \((2, 8)\) and \((8, 6)\).
- The hollow point ensures the endpoints are not included in the domain and range as specified.

---

### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

The domain and range of the function represented by the line segment are:
- Domain: \( (2, 8] \)
- Range: \( (8, 6] \)

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Domain: } (2, 8], \quad \text{Range: } (8, 6]}
\]
