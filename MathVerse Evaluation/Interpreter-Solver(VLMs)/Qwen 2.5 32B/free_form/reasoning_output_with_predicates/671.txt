### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the surface area of a composite solid consisting of two identical rectangular prisms connected by a cylindrical section. Let us systematically analyze the given information and deduce the solution step by step.

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
From the image and predicates:
1. **Rectangular Prisms**:
   - Dimensions: \(25 \times 20 \times 33\).
   - There are two identical rectangular prisms.
   
2. **Cylindrical Section**:
   - Radius of the circular base: \(6\).
   - Height of the cylinder: \(11\).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The cylindrical section connects the two rectangular prisms.
   - The surface area calculation must account for the overlap where the cylinder meets the prisms.

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Part 1: Surface Area of a Single Rectangular Prism**
The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{prism}} = 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]
where \(l = 25\), \(w = 20\), and \(h = 33\). Substituting these values:
\[
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{prism}} = 2(25 \cdot 20 + 25 \cdot 33 + 20 \cdot 33)
\]
\[
= 2(500 + 825 + 660)
\]
\[
= 2(1985) = 3970
\]

Since there are two identical prisms, the total surface area of both prisms (without considering overlaps) is:
\[
2 \cdot 3970 = 7940
\]

##### **Part 2: Surface Area of the Cylindrical Section**
The surface area of a cylinder consists of:
1. **Curved Surface Area**:
   \[
   \text{Curved Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi rh
   \]
   where \(r = 6\) and \(h = 11\). Substituting these values:
   \[
   \text{Curved Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 2\pi \cdot 6 \cdot 11 = 132\pi
   \]

2. **Base Areas of the Cylinder**:
   The cylinder has two circular bases, but since the bases are embedded within the prisms, they do not contribute to the external surface area.

Thus, the total surface area of the cylindrical section is:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area}_{\text{cylinder}} = 132\pi
\]

##### **Part 3: Adjusting for Overlaps**
When the cylinder is inserted into the prisms, it removes a portion of the surface area from the prisms. Specifically:
1. The cylinder removes a circular region from each prism's surface where it is attached.
   - The area of each circular region is:
     \[
     \text{Area of Circle} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 6^2 = 36\pi
     \]
   - Since the cylinder attaches to two faces of the prisms, it removes a total of:
     \[
     2 \cdot 36\pi = 72\pi
     \]

2. However, the cylinder itself adds its curved surface area to the overall surface area. Therefore, the net adjustment is:
   \[
   \text{Net Adjustment} = 132\pi - 72\pi = 60\pi
   \]

##### **Part 4: Total Surface Area of the Solid**
The total surface area of the solid is the sum of the surface areas of the two prisms plus the net contribution from the cylinder:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Surface Area of Prisms} + \text{Net Adjustment}
\]
\[
= 7940 + 60\pi
\]

Using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
\[
60\pi \approx 60 \cdot 3.14159 = 188.4954
\]
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 7940 + 188.4954 = 8128.4954
\]

Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 8128.50
\]

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
The final surface area of the solid is:
\[
\boxed{8128.50}
\]
