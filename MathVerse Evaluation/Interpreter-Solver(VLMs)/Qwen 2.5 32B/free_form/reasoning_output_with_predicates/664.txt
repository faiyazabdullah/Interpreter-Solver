### Problem Analysis:
The given image shows a sphere with a labeled diameter of \( 11 \, \text{cm} \). The goal is to calculate the surface area of the sphere. Let's proceed step by step.

---

### **STEP 1: CRITICAL INFORMATION ANALYSIS**

#### Visual Cues from the Image:
- The image depicts a sphere with a diameter marked as \( 11 \, \text{cm} \).
- The diameter is indicated by a dotted line passing through the center of the sphere.

#### Formal Predicates:
1. **Circle(C)**: The sphere is represented as a circular cross-section.
2. **RadiusOf(R,C)**: The radius \( R \) is related to the circle/sphere.
3. **LengthOf(R,11)**: The length of the radius is given as \( 11 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Key Measurements:
- Diameter of the sphere: \( 11 \, \text{cm} \).
- Radius of the sphere: Since the radius is half the diameter, \( R = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Question Objective:
The problem asks for the surface area of the sphere. The formula for the surface area \( A \) of a sphere is:
\[
A = 4\pi R^2
\]
where \( R \) is the radius of the sphere.

---

### **STEP 2: DEDUCTIVE REASONING CHAIN**

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Radius
From the given diameter:
\[
\text{Diameter} = 11 \, \text{cm}
\]
The radius \( R \) is half of the diameter:
\[
R = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### Step 2.2: Apply the Surface Area Formula
The surface area \( A \) of a sphere is given by:
\[
A = 4\pi R^2
\]
Substitute \( R = 5.5 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
A = 4\pi (5.5)^2
\]

#### Step 2.3: Perform the Calculations
First, calculate \( (5.5)^2 \):
\[
(5.5)^2 = 5.5 \times 5.5 = 30.25
\]
Next, multiply by \( 4\pi \):
\[
A = 4\pi \times 30.25 = 121\pi
\]

#### Step 2.4: Approximate the Result
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
A \approx 121 \times 3.14159 = 379.94 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### **STEP 3: CONCLUSION AND SELECTION**

The surface area of the sphere is approximately \( 379.94 \, \text{cm}^2 \). Rounded to two decimal places, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{379.94 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
