QUESTION:
A soft drink can has a height of 13 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Find L, the length of the longest straw that can fit into the can (so that the straw is not bent and fits entirely inside the can).

Give your answer rounded down to the nearest cm, to ensure it fits inside the can.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Visual Elements from the Image:
1. The image depicts a cylinder.
2. The diameter of the circular base is labeled as 3 cm.
3. The height of the cylinder is labeled as 13 cm.
4. A diagonal line is drawn from the top edge of the cylinder to the bottom edge, forming a right triangle inside the cylinder.

#### Key Predicates:
- **Shape(cylinder)**: The figure is a cylinder.
- **Circle(base)**: The base of the cylinder is a circle.
- **LengthOf(diameter) = 3**: The diameter of the circular base is 3 cm.
- **HeightOf(cylinder) = 13**: The height of the cylinder is 13 cm.
- **Line(diagonal)**: A diagonal line is present inside the cylinder.
- **LengthOf(diagonal) = L**: The length of the diagonal is denoted as \( L \).
- **Triangle(rightTriangle)**: The diagonal forms a right triangle with the height of the cylinder and the diameter of the base.
- **IsHypotenuseOf(diagonal, rightTriangle)**: The diagonal is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.
- **IsLegOf(height, rightTriangle)**: The height of the cylinder is one leg of the right triangle.
- **IsLegOf(diameter, rightTriangle)**: The diameter of the base is the other leg of the right triangle.
- **RightAngle(Angle(height, diameter, diagonal))**: The right triangle has a right angle at the intersection of the height and the diameter.
- **Perpendicular(height, base)**: The height is perpendicular to the base of the cylinder.

#### Specific Value to Find:
We need to find \( L \), the length of the diagonal (hypotenuse of the right triangle), which is the longest straight straw that can fit inside the cylinder.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Right Triangle
From the predicates and the image, we observe that the diagonal \( L \) forms a right triangle inside the cylinder. The legs of this right triangle are:
1. The height of the cylinder, which is 13 cm.
2. The diameter of the base, which is 3 cm.

By the **Pythagorean Theorem**, the relationship between the hypotenuse \( L \) and the legs of the right triangle is given by:
\[
L^2 = \text{(height)}^2 + \text{(diameter)}^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Substitute Known Values
Substitute the given values for the height and diameter:
\[
L^2 = 13^2 + 3^2
\]

Calculate the squares:
\[
13^2 = 169, \quad 3^2 = 9
\]

Thus:
\[
L^2 = 169 + 9 = 178
\]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for \( L \)
To find \( L \), take the square root of both sides:
\[
L = \sqrt{178}
\]

#### Step 2.4: Approximate \( L \)
Using a calculator, we find:
\[
\sqrt{178} \approx 13.34
\]

#### Step 2.5: Round Down to Ensure Fit
The problem requires rounding down to the nearest whole number to ensure the straw fits entirely inside the can without bending. Therefore:
\[
L = 13
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The length of the longest straw that can fit inside the can, rounded down to the nearest whole number, is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
