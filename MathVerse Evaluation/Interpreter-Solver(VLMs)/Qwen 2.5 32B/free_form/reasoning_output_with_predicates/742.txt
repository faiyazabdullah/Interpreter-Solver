QUESTION:
A wedding cake consists of three cylinders stacked on top of each other. The top layer has a radius and height of 20 cm, the middle layer has a radius double this, and the same height and the bottom layer has a radius three times as big, and is twice as high.

All the sides and top surfaces are to be covered in icing, but not the bottom.

What is the surface area of the cake that needs to be iced?

Give your answer to the nearest cm2.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Top Cylinder**:
   - Radius \( r_1 = 20 \, \text{cm} \)
   - Height \( h_1 = 20 \, \text{cm} \)

2. **Middle Cylinder**:
   - Radius \( r_2 = 2r_1 = 2 \times 20 = 40 \, \text{cm} \)
   - Height \( h_2 = 20 \, \text{cm} \)

3. **Bottom Cylinder**:
   - Radius \( r_3 = 3r_1 = 3 \times 20 = 60 \, \text{cm} \)
   - Height \( h_3 = 2h_1 = 2 \times 20 = 40 \, \text{cm} \)

#### Surface Area Components to Be Iced:
- **Top Surface of Each Cylinder**: Only the top surface of the top cylinder is visible since the others are covered by the layers above.
- **Lateral Surface Area of Each Cylinder**: The curved surface area of all three cylinders must be iced.
- **Bottom Surface of the Bottom Cylinder**: Not to be iced.

#### Required Calculation:
We need to calculate the total surface area that requires icing, which includes:
1. The top surface of the top cylinder.
2. The lateral surface area of all three cylinders.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### 1. Top Surface Area of the Top Cylinder
The top surface of the top cylinder is a circle with radius \( r_1 = 20 \, \text{cm} \). The area of this circle is given by:
\[
\text{Top Surface Area} = \pi r_1^2 = \pi (20)^2 = 400\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### 2. Lateral Surface Area of Each Cylinder
The lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = 2\pi r h
\]

- **Top Cylinder**:
  \[
  \text{Lateral Surface Area}_1 = 2\pi r_1 h_1 = 2\pi (20)(20) = 800\pi \, \text{cm}^2
  \]

- **Middle Cylinder**:
  \[
  \text{Lateral Surface Area}_2 = 2\pi r_2 h_2 = 2\pi (40)(20) = 1600\pi \, \text{cm}^2
  \]

- **Bottom Cylinder**:
  \[
  \text{Lateral Surface Area}_3 = 2\pi r_3 h_3 = 2\pi (60)(40) = 4800\pi \, \text{cm}^2
  \]

#### 3. Total Surface Area to Be Iced
The total surface area to be iced is the sum of:
1. The top surface area of the top cylinder.
2. The lateral surface areas of all three cylinders.

\[
\text{Total Iced Surface Area} = \text{Top Surface Area}_1 + \text{Lateral Surface Area}_1 + \text{Lateral Surface Area}_2 + \text{Lateral Surface Area}_3
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total Iced Surface Area} = 400\pi + 800\pi + 1600\pi + 4800\pi = 7600\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### 4. Numerical Approximation
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Total Iced Surface Area} \approx 7600 \times 3.14159 = 23876.004 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

Rounding to the nearest integer:
\[
\text{Total Iced Surface Area} \approx 23876 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the cake that needs to be iced is approximately \( 23876 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{23876}
\]
