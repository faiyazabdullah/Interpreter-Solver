QUESTION:
Consider the halfpipe with a diameter of 8 cm.

Find its volume, rounding to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given geometric figure is a halfpipe with a semicircular cross-section. We are tasked with finding its volume. The critical information provided includes:
- Diameter of the semicircular cross-section: \( 8 \) cm.
- Radius of the semicircular cross-section: \( 4 \) cm (since radius is half the diameter).
- Length of the halfpipe: \( 20 \) cm.

The volume of a halfpipe can be thought of as the volume of a semi-cylindrical shape. The formula for the volume of a full cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (or length) of the cylinder. Since the halfpipe is a semi-cylinder, its volume will be half of the volume of a full cylinder with the same dimensions.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Identify Key Dimensions**
From the given predicates:
- Diameter of the semicircular cross-section: \( 8 \) cm.
- Radius of the semicircular cross-section: \( r = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) cm.
- Length of the halfpipe: \( h = 20 \) cm.

#### **Step 2: Volume of a Full Cylinder**
The volume of a full cylinder with radius \( r = 4 \) cm and height \( h = 20 \) cm is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4)^2 (20) = \pi (16)(20) = 320\pi \text{ cm}^3
\]

#### **Step 3: Volume of the Halfpipe**
Since the halfpipe is a semi-cylinder, its volume is half of the volume of the full cylinder:
\[
V_{\text{halfpipe}} = \frac{1}{2} V_{\text{cylinder}} = \frac{1}{2} (320\pi) = 160\pi \text{ cm}^3
\]

#### **Step 4: Numerical Approximation**
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
V_{\text{halfpipe}} = 160\pi \approx 160 \times 3.14159 = 502.6544 \text{ cm}^3
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
V_{\text{halfpipe}} \approx 502.65 \text{ cm}^3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{502.65 \text{ cm}^3}
\]
