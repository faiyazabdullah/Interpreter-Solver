### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Analysis:
- The image shows a circle centered at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The circle intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-4, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\).
- The circle intersects the \(y\)-axis at \((0, -4)\) and \((0, 4)\).

#### Predicate Analysis:
1. **Circle(1)**: There is a circle labeled as Circle(1).
2. **Points on the Circle**:
   - Point \((-4, 0)\) lies on Circle(1).
   - Point \((4, 0)\) lies on Circle(1).
   - Point \((0, -4)\) lies on Circle(1).
   - Point \((0, 4)\) lies on Circle(1).
3. **Line Segments**:
   - Line segment joining \((-4, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\) has a length of 8.
   - Line segment joining \((0, -4)\) and \((0, 4)\) has a length of 8.
4. **Diameters**:
   - The line segment joining \((-4, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\) is a diameter of Circle(1).
   - The line segment joining \((0, -4)\) and \((0, 4)\) is a diameter of Circle(1).
5. **Diameter of Circle(1)**:
   - The diameter of Circle(1) is given as 8.

#### Key Observations:
- The circle is symmetric about both the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis.
- The points \((-4, 0)\), \((4, 0)\), \((0, -4)\), and \((0, 4)\) are endpoints of diameters.
- The diameter of the circle is explicitly stated as 8.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Confirm the Diameter Using Points
- From the predicates, the line segment joining \((-4, 0)\) and \((4, 0)\) is a diameter of Circle(1). The length of this line segment is:
  \[
  \text{Length} = |4 - (-4)| = 8.
  \]
- Similarly, the line segment joining \((0, -4)\) and \((0, 4)\) is also a diameter of Circle(1). The length of this line segment is:
  \[
  \text{Length} = |4 - (-4)| = 8.
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Verify the Diameter Using the Circle's Definition
- By definition, the diameter of a circle is the longest chord passing through its center. Both \((-4, 0)\) to \((4, 0)\) and \((0, -4)\) to \((0, 4)\) pass through the center \((0, 0)\) and have a length of 8. Therefore, these are indeed diameters.

#### Step 2.3: Consistency with Predicates
- The predicates state that the diameter of Circle(1) is 8. This is consistent with the lengths of the line segments calculated above.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

From the above deductions, the diameter of the circle is clearly 8.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
