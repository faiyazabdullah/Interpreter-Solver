QUESTION:
Consider the following rectangular prism with length width and height equal to 12 m, 6 m and 4 m respectively.

Find the surface area of the prism.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the surface area of a rectangular prism whose dimensions are given as length \( l = 12 \) m, width \( w = 6 \) m, and height \( h = 4 \) m. The predicates and the image confirm that the figure is a rectangular prism, and the faces are rectangles. The surface area of a rectangular prism is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Surface Area} = 2(lw + lh + wh)
\]

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Length (\( l \)) = 12 m
  - Width (\( w \)) = 6 m
  - Height (\( h \)) = 4 m
- **Predicates Confirm**:
  - Faces are rectangles.
  - Opposite faces are congruent.
  - Dimensions of each face are consistent with the given lengths, widths, and heights.
- **Visual Confirmation**: The image shows a rectangular prism with the specified dimensions.

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Areas of Each Face**:
   - **Face 1 and Face 4**: These are the front and back faces of the prism. Their dimensions are length (\( l \)) and width (\( w \)).
     \[
     \text{Area of Face 1} = lw = 12 \times 6 = 72 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
     Since Face 1 and Face 4 are congruent:
     \[
     \text{Area of Face 4} = 72 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

   - **Face 2 and Face 5**: These are the left and right faces of the prism. Their dimensions are length (\( l \)) and height (\( h \)).
     \[
     \text{Area of Face 2} = lh = 12 \times 4 = 48 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
     Since Face 2 and Face 5 are congruent:
     \[
     \text{Area of Face 5} = 48 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

   - **Face 3 and Face 6**: These are the top and bottom faces of the prism. Their dimensions are width (\( w \)) and height (\( h \)).
     \[
     \text{Area of Face 3} = wh = 6 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
     Since Face 3 and Face 6 are congruent:
     \[
     \text{Area of Face 6} = 24 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Surface Area**:
   - The total surface area is the sum of the areas of all six faces. Since opposite faces are congruent, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Surface Area} = 2(lw + lh + wh)
     \]
   - Substitute the given dimensions:
     \[
     \text{Surface Area} = 2(12 \times 6 + 12 \times 4 + 6 \times 4)
     \]
   - Perform the multiplications:
     \[
     12 \times 6 = 72, \quad 12 \times 4 = 48, \quad 6 \times 4 = 24
     \]
   - Add the products:
     \[
     72 + 48 + 24 = 144
     \]
   - Multiply by 2:
     \[
     2 \times 144 = 288
     \]

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The surface area of the rectangular prism is \( 288 \, \text{m}^2 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{288}
\]
