QUESTION:
For the following exercises, use the graph in Figure 7, which shows the profit, y, in thousands of dollars, of a company in a given year, t, where t represents the number of years since 1980. The line chart is begin from (15,150) and goes to (25,130).

Find the linear function  y,  where  y  depends on  t,  the number of years since 1980.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the linear function \( y \), where \( y \) represents the profit in thousands of dollars and depends on \( t \), the number of years since 1980. The given data points are:
- Point \( A(15, 150) \): This corresponds to the year 1995 (since \( t = 15 \)) and a profit of 150 thousand dollars.
- Point \( B(25, 130) \): This corresponds to the year 2005 (since \( t = 25 \)) and a profit of 130 thousand dollars.

The goal is to determine the equation of the line passing through these two points, which will represent the linear function \( y(t) \).

---

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and the predicates:
1. The line passes through the points \( A(15, 150) \) and \( B(25, 130) \).
2. The coordinates of point \( A \) are \( (15, 150) \).
3. The coordinates of point \( B \) are \( (25, 130) \).
4. The relationship between \( y \) and \( t \) is linear, so the equation of the line can be written in the form:
   \[
   y = mt + b
   \]
   where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Calculate the Slope \( m \)**
The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Substitute the coordinates of points \( A(15, 150) \) and \( B(25, 130) \):
\[
m = \frac{130 - 150}{25 - 15} = \frac{-20}{10} = -2
\]
Thus, the slope \( m \) is:
\[
m = -2
\]

#### **Step 2.2: Use Point-Slope Form to Find the Equation**
The point-slope form of a line is:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
Using point \( A(15, 150) \) and the slope \( m = -2 \):
\[
y - 150 = -2(t - 15)
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
y - 150 = -2t + 30
\]
\[
y = -2t + 30 + 150
\]
\[
y = -2t + 180
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Verify the Equation**
To ensure correctness, substitute the coordinates of point \( B(25, 130) \) into the equation \( y = -2t + 180 \):
\[
y = -2(25) + 180 = -50 + 180 = 130
\]
This matches the given point \( B(25, 130) \), confirming the equation is correct.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The linear function \( y \) that depends on \( t \) is:
\[
y = -2t + 180
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y = -2t + 180}
\]
