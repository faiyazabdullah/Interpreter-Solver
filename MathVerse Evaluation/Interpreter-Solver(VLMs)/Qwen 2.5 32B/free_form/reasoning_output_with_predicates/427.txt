QUESTION:
A boat travels S 14^\circ E for 12 km and then changes direction to S 49^\circ E for another 16 km.

Hence write down the bearing that the boat should travel on to return to the starting point.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the bearing that a boat should take to return to its starting point after traveling two segments:
1. S 14° E for 12 km,
2. S 49° E for 16 km.

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Initial Position (Start)**: The boat starts at a point labeled "Start."
2. **First Segment**: The boat travels 12 km in the direction S 14° E.
   - This means it moves 14° east of south.
3. **Second Segment**: The boat then travels 16 km in the direction S 49° E.
   - This means it moves 49° east of south.
4. **Return Path**: We need to determine the bearing from the current position back to the starting point.

#### Objective:
We need to calculate the bearing of the return path. The bearing is measured clockwise from north.

---

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
- The boat's first segment is 12 km at S 14° E.
- The second segment is 16 km at S 49° E.
- The return path forms a triangle with the starting point, the first position, and the current position.

#### Known Quantities:
1. Length of first segment: \( 12 \) km.
2. Length of second segment: \( 16 \) km.
3. Angles:
   - First segment direction: S 14° E.
   - Second segment direction: S 49° E.
   - Internal angles at the vertices can be determined using these directions.

#### Unknowns:
- The bearing of the return path from the current position to the starting point.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Convert Bearings to Cartesian Coordinates
To simplify calculations, we convert the bearings into Cartesian coordinates. Assume the starting point is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

1. **First Segment (S 14° E, 12 km):**
   - Direction S 14° E means 14° east of south.
   - South corresponds to \(-90^\circ\) from north.
   - Therefore, the angle from north is \(-90^\circ + 14^\circ = -76^\circ\).
   - Using trigonometry:
     \[
     x_1 = 12 \cos(-76^\circ), \quad y_1 = 12 \sin(-76^\circ)
     \]
     \[
     x_1 = 12 \cos(76^\circ), \quad y_1 = -12 \sin(76^\circ)
     \]
     Using approximate values:
     \[
     \cos(76^\circ) \approx 0.2419, \quad \sin(76^\circ) \approx 0.9703
     \]
     \[
     x_1 \approx 12 \cdot 0.2419 = 2.9028, \quad y_1 \approx -12 \cdot 0.9703 = -11.6436
     \]
     So, the endpoint of the first segment is approximately \((2.9028, -11.6436)\).

2. **Second Segment (S 49° E, 16 km):**
   - Direction S 49° E means 49° east of south.
   - The angle from north is \(-90^\circ + 49^\circ = -41^\circ\).
   - Using trigonometry:
     \[
     x_2 = 16 \cos(-41^\circ), \quad y_2 = 16 \sin(-41^\circ)
     \]
     \[
     x_2 = 16 \cos(41^\circ), \quad y_2 = -16 \sin(41^\circ)
     \]
     Using approximate values:
     \[
     \cos(41^\circ) \approx 0.7547, \quad \sin(41^\circ) \approx 0.6561
     \]
     \[
     x_2 \approx 16 \cdot 0.7547 = 12.0752, \quad y_2 \approx -16 \cdot 0.6561 = -10.4976
     \]
     The displacement from the first endpoint is \((x_2, y_2)\). Adding this to the first endpoint:
     \[
     x_{\text{final}} = 2.9028 + 12.0752 = 14.9780, \quad y_{\text{final}} = -11.6436 - 10.4976 = -22.1412
     \]
     So, the final position of the boat is approximately \((14.9780, -22.1412)\).

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Return Bearing
To return to the starting point \((0, 0)\) from \((14.9780, -22.1412)\), we need to calculate the bearing of the vector from \((14.9780, -22.1412)\) to \((0, 0)\).

The vector from \((14.9780, -22.1412)\) to \((0, 0)\) is:
\[
(-14.9780, 22.1412)
\]

The angle \(\theta\) this vector makes with the positive \(x\)-axis (east) is given by:
\[
\tan(\theta) = \frac{22.1412}{-14.9780}
\]
\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{22.1412}{-14.9780}\right)
\]
Using a calculator:
\[
\theta \approx \tan^{-1}(-1.4787) \approx -56.0^\circ
\]
This angle is measured clockwise from the positive \(x\)-axis. Since the vector is in the second quadrant (west of north), we adjust the angle to be measured clockwise from north:
\[
\text{Bearing} = 180^\circ + \theta = 180^\circ - 56.0^\circ = 124.0^\circ
\]

Thus, the bearing to return to the starting point is N 56° W.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The bearing that the boat should travel on to return to the starting point is N 56° W.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{\text{N 56° W}}\]
