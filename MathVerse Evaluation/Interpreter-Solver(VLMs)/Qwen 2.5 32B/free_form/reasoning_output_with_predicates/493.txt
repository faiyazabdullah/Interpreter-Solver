FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the equation of a piecewise linear function \( f(x) \) that is defined by straight lines passing through specific points. The given predicates and the image provide the necessary information about the slopes and points that lie on these lines. Let's break down the problem step by step.

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

From the image and predicates:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Points \((0, 1)\), \((1, 0)\), and \((3, -2)\) lie on the first segment of the function.
   - Points \((3, -2)\) and \((5, 0)\) lie on the second segment of the function.
2. **Slopes**:
   - The slope of the line passing through \((0, 1)\) and \((1, 0)\) is \(-1\) (from Predicate: \( \text{SlopeOf}(Line(0,1,1,0), -1) \)).
   - The slope of the line passing through \((3, -2)\) and \((5, 0)\) is \(1\) (from Predicate: \( \text{SlopeOf}(Line(3,-2,5,0), 1) \)).

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Part 1: Equation of the First Segment**
The first segment passes through the points \((0, 1)\) and \((1, 0)\). We know its slope is \(-1\).

1. **Using the Point-Slope Form**:
   The point-slope form of a line is:
   \[
   y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
   \]
   Using the point \((0, 1)\) and slope \(m = -1\):
   \[
   y - 1 = -1(x - 0) \implies y = -x + 1
   \]
   This equation is valid for the segment connecting \((0, 1)\) and \((1, 0)\), and it continues until \(x = 3\).

2. **Domain of the First Segment**:
   The first segment starts at \(x = 0\) and ends at \(x = 3\). Therefore, the domain is \(0 \leq x \leq 3\).

##### **Part 2: Equation of the Second Segment**
The second segment passes through the points \((3, -2)\) and \((5, 0)\). We know its slope is \(1\).

1. **Using the Point-Slope Form**:
   Using the point \((3, -2)\) and slope \(m = 1\):
   \[
   y - (-2) = 1(x - 3) \implies y + 2 = x - 3 \implies y = x - 5
   \]
   This equation is valid for the segment connecting \((3, -2)\) and \((5, 0)\), and it continues beyond \(x = 5\).

2. **Domain of the Second Segment**:
   The second segment starts at \(x = 3\) and extends to \(x = 5\) and beyond. Therefore, the domain is \(x \geq 3\).

#### **Step 3: Combine the Segments into a Piecewise Function**
The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise as follows:
- For \(0 \leq x \leq 3\), the function is \(y = -x + 1\).
- For \(x \geq 3\), the function is \(y = x - 5\).

Thus, the piecewise function is:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x + 1 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 3, \\
x - 5 & \text{if } x \geq 3.
\end{cases}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x + 1 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 3, \\
x - 5 & \text{if } x \geq 3.
\end{cases}
}
\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x + 1 & \text{if } 0 \leq x \leq 3, \\
x - 5 & \text{if } x \geq 3.
\end{cases}$
