FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### Visual Analysis:
- The image shows a right circular cylinder.
- The radius of the base circle is labeled as \( 6 \, \text{cm} \).
- The height of the cylinder is labeled as \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Predicate Analysis:
- From the predicates:
  - `Circle(1)` indicates there is a circle involved.
  - `LengthOf(radius) = 6` specifies the radius of the circle is \( 6 \, \text{cm} \).
  - `LengthOf(height) = 10` specifies the height of the cylinder is \( 10 \, \text{cm} \).
  - `IsRadiusOf(radius, Circle(1))` confirms that the radius is associated with the base circle of the cylinder.

#### Key Measurements:
- Radius (\( r \)) = \( 6 \, \text{cm} \)
- Height (\( h \)) = \( 10 \, \text{cm} \)

#### Question Objective:
We need to find the surface area of the cylinder. The surface area of a cylinder consists of:
1. The lateral surface area (curved surface area).
2. The areas of the two circular bases.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Formula for Surface Area of a Cylinder:
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]
where:
- \( 2\pi r^2 \) is the combined area of the two circular bases.
- \( 2\pi rh \) is the lateral surface area.

#### Substituting Known Values:
1. **Base Area Calculation:**
   The area of one circular base is:
   \[
   \text{Area of one base} = \pi r^2
   \]
   Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:
   \[
   2\pi r^2
   \]

2. **Lateral Surface Area Calculation:**
   The lateral surface area is:
   \[
   2\pi rh
   \]

3. **Total Surface Area:**
   Combining the areas of the bases and the lateral surface area:
   \[
   A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
   \]

#### Plugging in the Values:
- Radius (\( r \)) = \( 6 \, \text{cm} \)
- Height (\( h \)) = \( 10 \, \text{cm} \)
- Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):

##### Step 1: Calculate \( 2\pi r^2 \):
\[
2\pi r^2 = 2 \pi (6)^2 = 2 \pi (36) = 72\pi
\]
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
72\pi \approx 72 \times 3.14159 = 226.19472
\]

##### Step 2: Calculate \( 2\pi rh \):
\[
2\pi rh = 2 \pi (6)(10) = 2 \pi (60) = 120\pi
\]
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
120\pi \approx 120 \times 3.14159 = 376.99112
\]

##### Step 3: Total Surface Area:
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh = 226.19472 + 376.99112 = 603.18584
\]

Rounding to the nearest two decimal places:
\[
A \approx 603.19
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The total surface area of the cylinder is approximately \( 603.19 \, \text{cm}^2 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{603.19 \text{ cm}^2}\]
