FINAL RESPONSE:

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the domain and range of a function represented by a curve on a coordinate plane. The curve starts at a solid point \((1, 0)\) and ends at an open point \((-4, 4)\), indicated by an arrow. The given predicates provide additional information about the points and the line, which will help us deduce the domain and range.

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
1. **Points**:
   - Point \(A\) is given by \(\text{Equals}(A, (1, 0))\). This means the curve starts at \((1, 0)\).
   - Point \(B\) is given by \(\text{Equals}(B, (-4, 4))\). This means the curve passes through \((-4, 4)\).

2. **Line**:
   - The predicate \(\text{PointLiesOnLine}(B, L)\) indicates that point \(B\) lies on the line \(L\). However, since we are dealing with a curve, this information is less relevant to the domain and range but confirms that \((-4, 4)\) is part of the path.

3. **Curve Characteristics**:
   - The curve starts at \((1, 0)\) and extends leftward, passing through \((-4, 4)\).
   - The arrow at the end of the curve indicates that the curve does not continue beyond \((-4, 4)\).

4. **Domain and Range**:
   - The domain is the set of all \(x\)-values that the curve covers.
   - The range is the set of all \(y\)-values that the curve covers.

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Domain**:
   - From the image, the curve starts at \(x = 1\) and extends leftward to \(x = -4\).
   - Since the curve includes the starting point \((1, 0)\) but does not include the endpoint \((-4, 4)\) (indicated by the open point), the domain is all \(x\)-values from \(-4\) to \(1\), inclusive of \(1\) but exclusive of \(-4\).
   - Therefore, the domain is \([-4, 1)\).

2. **Identify the Range**:
   - From the image, the curve starts at \(y = 0\) and extends upward to \(y = 4\).
   - Since the curve includes the starting point \((1, 0)\) but does not include the endpoint \((-4, 4)\) (indicated by the open point), the range is all \(y\)-values from \(0\) to \(4\), inclusive of \(0\) but exclusive of \(4\).
   - Therefore, the range is \([0, 4)\).

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
Based on the deductions above, the domain and range of the function are:
- Domain: \([-4, 1)\)
- Range: \([0, 4)\)

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Domain: } [-4, 1), \quad \text{Range: } [0, 4)}
\]
