### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Elements from the Image:
1. The figure depicts a **cylinder**.
2. The cylinder has two circular bases (top and bottom) and a curved lateral surface.
3. The **major radius** \( R \) is labeled as the radius of the larger base.
4. The **minor radius** \( r \) is labeled as the radius of the smaller base.
5. The **length** \( L \) is the height of the cylinder, connecting the centers of the two bases.

#### Formal Predicates:
- **Circle(1)**: Represents the top circular base of the cylinder.
- **Circle(2)**: Represents the bottom circular base of the cylinder.
- **LengthOf(L)**: Specifies the height of the cylinder.
- **RadiusOf(R)**: Specifies the radius of the larger base.
- **RadiusOf(r)**: Specifies the radius of the smaller base.

#### Question:
We are tasked with finding the **surface area** of the cylinder. The surface area includes:
1. The areas of the two circular bases.
2. The area of the lateral surface.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Surface Area of the Circular Bases
The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[
\text{Area of a circle} = \pi r^2
\]
- The **larger base** has a radius \( R \). Thus, its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger base} = \pi R^2
\]
- The **smaller base** has a radius \( r \). Thus, its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller base} = \pi r^2
\]
- Since the cylinder has two bases (one top and one bottom), the total area of the bases is:
\[
\text{Total area of the bases} = \pi R^2 + \pi r^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Surface Area of the Lateral Surface
The lateral surface of the cylinder is a rectangle when "unrolled." The dimensions of this rectangle are:
- **Height**: The length of the cylinder \( L \).
- **Width**: The circumference of the circular base. The circumference of a circle is given by \( 2\pi \times \text{radius} \).

Since the cylinder has two radii \( R \) and \( r \), we assume the lateral surface is formed by the average radius. However, if the problem involves a frustum-like structure, we would use the slant height. But here, it is a standard cylinder with consistent radii along the height. Therefore, the lateral surface area is:
\[
\text{Lateral surface area} = 2\pi \cdot \text{average radius} \cdot L
\]
Given that the radii \( R \) and \( r \) are constant along the height, the average radius is simply \( R \) or \( r \). However, if this is a frustum, we would use the slant height. Assuming it is a standard cylinder, the lateral surface area is:
\[
\text{Lateral surface area} = 2\pi R L + 2\pi r L = 2\pi (R + r) L
\]

#### Step 2.3: Total Surface Area
The total surface area of the cylinder is the sum of the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface:
\[
\text{Total surface area} = \text{Area of the bases} + \text{Lateral surface area}
\]
Substituting the expressions derived:
\[
\text{Total surface area} = (\pi R^2 + \pi r^2) + 2\pi (R + r) L
\]
Factorizing the expression:
\[
\text{Total surface area} = \pi (R^2 + r^2) + 2\pi (R + r) L = \pi [(R^2 + r^2) + 2(R + r)L]
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The final expression for the surface area of the cylinder, fully factorized, is:
\[
\text{Surface Area} = \pi [(R^2 + r^2) + 2(R + r)L]
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\pi [(R^2 + r^2) + 2(R + r)L]}
\]
