### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The circle is centered at the origin \( O(0, 0) \).
- The circle intersects the coordinate axes at the points:
  - \( (-5, 0) \) on the negative \( x \)-axis,
  - \( (5, 0) \) on the positive \( x \)-axis,
  - \( (0, 5) \) on the positive \( y \)-axis,
  - \( (0, -5) \) on the negative \( y \)-axis.
- The radius of the circle appears to be 5 units.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Circle(C)**: There is a circle labeled \( C \).
2. **PointLiesOnCircle(Point(-5,0), Circle(C))**: The point \( (-5, 0) \) lies on the circle.
3. **PointLiesOnCircle(Point(5,0), Circle(C))**: The point \( (5, 0) \) lies on the circle.
4. **PointLiesOnCircle(Point(0,5), Circle(C))**: The point \( (0, 5) \) lies on the circle.
5. **PointLiesOnCircle(Point(0,-5), Circle(C))**: The point \( (0, -5) \) lies on the circle.
6. **Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(C)), 5)**: The radius of the circle \( C \) is 5 units.
7. **Point(O)**: There is a point \( O \).
8. **Equals(O, Point(0,0))**: The point \( O \) is at the origin \( (0, 0) \).

#### Key Observations:
- The circle is centered at the origin \( O(0, 0) \).
- The radius of the circle is 5 units.
- Every point on the circle is equidistant from the center \( O(0, 0) \).

#### What the Question Asks:
We need to determine the distance of every point on the circle from a specific point. Based on the given information, this specific point is the center of the circle.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Center of the Circle
From the predicate **Equals(O, Point(0,0))**, we know that the center of the circle is at \( O(0, 0) \).

#### Step 2.2: Use the Definition of a Circle
By definition, a circle is the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point called the center. The distance from the center to any point on the circle is the radius.

#### Step 2.3: Radius of the Circle
From the predicate **Equals(RadiusOf(Circle(C)), 5)**, the radius of the circle is 5 units.

#### Step 2.4: Distance from Any Point on the Circle to the Center
Let \( P(x, y) \) be any point on the circle. By the distance formula, the distance from \( P(x, y) \) to the center \( O(0, 0) \) is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \( P(x, y) \) lies on the circle, this distance is equal to the radius of the circle, which is 5 units. Therefore:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 5
\]
This confirms that every point on the circle is exactly 5 units away from the center \( O(0, 0) \).

#### Step 2.5: Combine Results
From the above deductions, we conclude that every point on the circle is exactly 5 units away from the point \( (0, 0) \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the systematic deduction, the statement can be completed as follows:
Every point on the circle is exactly 5 units away from the point \( (0, 0) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{5 \quad (0, 0)}
\]
