### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Image:
- The image depicts a cylinder.
- The diameter of the circular base is labeled as 98 mm.
- The height of the cylinder is labeled as 80 mm.

#### Predicates Provided:
1. **Shape(Cylinder(1))**: The figure is a cylinder.
2. **DiameterOf(Circle(1), 98)**: The diameter of the circular base is 98 mm.
3. **HeightOf(Cylinder(1), 80)**: The height of the cylinder is 80 mm.
4. **IsRadiusOf(Line(A,B), Circle(1))**: Line \(AB\) is the radius of the circular base.
5. **LengthOf(Line(A,B), 49)**: The length of the radius \(AB\) is 49 mm.

#### Key Observations:
- The diameter of the circular base is 98 mm, so the radius \(r\) is half of the diameter:
  \[
  r = \frac{98}{2} = 49 \text{ mm}
  \]
  This confirms the predicate **LengthOf(Line(A,B), 49)**.
- The height \(h\) of the cylinder is given as 80 mm.
- The task is to find the surface area of the cylinder.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Surface Area Formula for a Cylinder:
The total surface area \(A\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]
where:
- \(r\) is the radius of the circular base,
- \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

#### Substituting Known Values:
From the predicates and the image:
- Radius \(r = 49 \text{ mm}\),
- Height \(h = 80 \text{ mm}\).

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
A = 2\pi (49)^2 + 2\pi (49)(80)
\]

#### Step-by-Step Calculation:
1. Calculate the area of the two circular bases:
   \[
   2\pi r^2 = 2\pi (49)^2 = 2\pi (2401) = 4802\pi
   \]

2. Calculate the lateral surface area:
   \[
   2\pi rh = 2\pi (49)(80) = 2\pi (3920) = 7840\pi
   \]

3. Add the areas together to get the total surface area:
   \[
   A = 4802\pi + 7840\pi = 12642\pi
   \]

4. Approximate the value using \(\pi \approx 3.14159\):
   \[
   A \approx 12642 \times 3.14159 = 39703.14 \text{ mm}^2
   \]

#### Rounding to Two Decimal Places:
The total surface area is approximately:
\[
A \approx 39703.14 \text{ mm}^2
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The final answer, rounded to two decimal places, is:
\[
\boxed{39703.14 \text{ mm}^2}
\]
