### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The image shows a circle centered at a point in the coordinate plane.
2. The center of the circle appears to be located at the point \((-4, -2)\).
3. The circle intersects the axes at two points, but these points are not explicitly labeled or measured in the image.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Predicate**: Point(Center)
   - This indicates that there is a point labeled as the center of the circle.
2. **Predicate**: Circle(C)
   - This indicates the existence of a circle, denoted by \(C\).
3. **Predicate**: IsCentroidOf(Center, C)
   - This confirms that the point labeled as "Center" is indeed the center of the circle \(C\).
4. **Predicate**: Equals(Center, (-4, -2))
   - This specifies that the coordinates of the center of the circle are \((-4, -2)\).

#### Key Observations:
- The center of the circle is explicitly given as \((-4, -2)\) in the predicates.
- The image visually confirms this, showing the center at approximately \((-4, -2)\).
- The question asks us to find the center of the circle, which is already provided in the predicates.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Center of the Circle
- From the predicate **Equals(Center, (-4, -2))**, we know that the center of the circle is at the point \((-4, -2)\).
- This is confirmed by the image, where the center is visually placed at \((-4, -2)\).

#### Step 2.2: Verify Intersection Points with Axes
- The problem mentions that the circle intersects the axes at two points. However, the exact coordinates of these intersection points are not required to determine the center of the circle.
- The center of the circle remains unchanged regardless of its intersections with the axes.

#### Step 2.3: Conclude the Center's Coordinates
- Since the center of the circle is explicitly given as \((-4, -2)\) and visually confirmed, we can directly state the coordinates of the center.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The center of the circle is \((-4, -2)\). This is explicitly stated in the predicates and visually confirmed in the image.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(-4, -2)}
\]
