FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The image shows a U-shaped curve that opens upwards.
- The curve passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The curve is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis.

#### Formal Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x,0))**: The point \((0, 0)\) lies on the \(x\)-axis.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(0,y))**: The point \((0, 0)\) lies on the \(y\)-axis.
3. **Shape(U-shaped curve)**: The shape is described as a U-shaped curve.
4. **Symmetric(U-shaped curve, Line(0,y))**: The U-shaped curve is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis.

#### Key Observations:
- The curve passes through the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The symmetry about the \(y\)-axis implies that for every point \((x, y)\) on the curve, the point \((-x, y)\) is also on the curve.

#### Question:
We need to determine whether the graphed function is even, odd, or neither.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding Even and Odd Functions
- A function \( f(x) \) is **even** if \( f(-x) = f(x) \) for all \( x \) in its domain.
- A function \( f(x) \) is **odd** if \( f(-x) = -f(x) \) for all \( x \) in its domain.
- If neither condition holds, the function is **neither even nor odd**.

#### Step 2.2: Analyzing Symmetry
- The given predicate **Symmetric(U-shaped curve, Line(0,y))** indicates that the curve is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis.
- Symmetry about the \(y\)-axis is a characteristic of **even functions**. This means that for every point \((x, y)\) on the curve, the point \((-x, y)\) is also on the curve. Mathematically, this corresponds to \( f(-x) = f(x) \).

#### Step 2.3: Verifying the Origin
- The curve passes through the origin \((0, 0)\). This is consistent with the general behavior of even functions, as even functions satisfy \( f(0) = 0 \) if the origin is on the graph.

#### Step 2.4: Conclusion Based on Symmetry
- Since the curve is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis, it satisfies the definition of an even function: \( f(-x) = f(x) \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The graphed function is **even** because it is symmetric about the \(y\)-axis.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{\text{even}}\]
