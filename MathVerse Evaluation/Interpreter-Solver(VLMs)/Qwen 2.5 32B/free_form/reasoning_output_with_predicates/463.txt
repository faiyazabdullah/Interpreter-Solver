### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the center of a circle based on the given geometric setup and visual information. Let us systematically analyze the problem step by step.

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
1. **Image Analysis**:
   - The circle is shown in the coordinate plane.
   - The circle intersects the \( x \)-axis at two points.
   - The center of the circle appears to be located near the origin but slightly offset.

2. **Predicates Analysis**:
   - **Circle(1)**: There is a circle denoted as Circle(1).
   - **PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A),Circle(1))**, etc.: Points \( A, B, C, D \) lie on the circle.
   - **Point(O)**: There is a point \( O \), which is the center of the circle.
   - **Circle(O)**: The circle is centered at \( O \).
   - **PointLiesOnCircle(O, Circle(1))**: This predicate seems redundant because the center of a circle does not lie on the circle itself. It may be an error in the problem statement.
   - **IsCentroidOf(O,Circle(1))**: Point \( O \) is the centroid (center) of Circle(1).
   - **Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,A)), LengthOf(Line(O,B)))**, etc.: All radii of the circle are equal.
   - **Perpendicular(Line(OX), Line(OY))**: The lines \( OX \) and \( OY \) are perpendicular, indicating that \( OX \) and \( OY \) represent the \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes, respectively.
   - **Point(OX)** and **Point(OY)**: These points lie on the \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes, respectively.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The circle intersects the \( x \)-axis at two points, which means its center lies vertically above or below the midpoint of these intersection points.
   - The center of the circle is equidistant from all points on the circle, as indicated by the equal radius lengths.

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

1. **Identify Intersection Points with the \( x \)-Axis**:
   - From the image, the circle intersects the \( x \)-axis at two points. Let these points be \( (x_1, 0) \) and \( (x_2, 0) \).
   - The center of the circle lies vertically above or below the midpoint of these two points. The midpoint of the \( x \)-intercepts is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, 0 \right)
     \]

2. **Determine the Center's Vertical Position**:
   - The center of the circle is also equidistant from the \( x \)-axis and the top/bottom of the circle. From the image, the circle appears symmetric about its center.
   - The vertical distance from the center to the \( x \)-axis can be estimated by observing the height of the circle above the \( x \)-axis.

3. **Estimate Coordinates from the Image**:
   - From the image, the circle intersects the \( x \)-axis near \( (-6, 0) \) and \( (-2, 0) \). The midpoint of these points is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{-6 + (-2)}{2}, 0 \right) = (-4, 0)
     \]
   - The center of the circle appears to be vertically above this midpoint. By visually estimating the symmetry, the center is approximately \( (-4, -2) \).

4. **Verify the Center**:
   - The center \( O \) is equidistant from all points on the circle. Since the circle is symmetric and the midpoint of the \( x \)-intercepts is \( (-4, 0) \), the vertical offset (approximately 2 units down) confirms the center as \( (-4, -2) \).

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
Based on the systematic analysis and visual estimation, the center of the circle is \( (-4, -2) \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(-4, -2)}
\]
