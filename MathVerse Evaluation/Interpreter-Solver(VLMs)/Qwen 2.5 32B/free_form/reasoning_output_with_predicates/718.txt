QUESTION:
Consider the two similar spheres shown. The smaller sphere has radius $3$ cm while the larger sphere has a radius of 12 cm.


Find the volume of Sphere A, in simplest exact form.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the volume of Sphere A, given that it is a smaller sphere with a radius of 3 cm. The larger sphere (Sphere B) has a radius of 12 cm, and both spheres are similar. The volume of a sphere is given by the formula:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Since the problem specifies that Sphere A has a radius of 3 cm, we will use this information directly to calculate its volume.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Identify Key Information**
- From the predicates:
  - Circle(A) and Circle(B) represent the spheres.
  - RadiusOf(A) = 3 cm.
  - RadiusOf(B) = 12 cm.
  - Similar(Circle(A), Circle(B)) indicates that the spheres are similar, but this does not affect the calculation of the volume of Sphere A directly since we already know its radius.

#### **Step 2: Apply the Volume Formula**
The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[
V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
For Sphere A, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm. Substituting \( r = 3 \) into the formula:
\[
V_{\text{A}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3
\]

#### **Step 3: Calculate the Cube of the Radius**
First, compute \( 3^3 \):
\[
3^3 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 27
\]

#### **Step 4: Substitute and Simplify**
Now substitute \( 27 \) back into the volume formula:
\[
V_{\text{A}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 27
\]
Simplify the expression:
\[
V_{\text{A}} = \frac{4 \cdot 27}{3} \pi = \frac{108}{3} \pi = 36 \pi
\]

### Conclusion:
The volume of Sphere A is \( 36\pi \) cubic centimeters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{36\pi}
\]
