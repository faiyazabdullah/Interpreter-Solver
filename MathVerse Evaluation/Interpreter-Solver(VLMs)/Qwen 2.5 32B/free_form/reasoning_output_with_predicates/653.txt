====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The image depicts a hemisphere.
- The radius of the hemisphere is shown as a line segment from the center of the base to the edge of the circular base, labeled with a length of 6.

#### Formal Predicates:
1. **Circle(C)**: There is a circle involved in the setup.
2. **IsRadiusOf(L, C)**: Line \( L \) is the radius of Circle \( C \).
3. **LengthOf(L, 6)**: The length of the radius \( L \) is 6.

#### Key Measurements:
- The radius of the hemisphere is given as 6.

#### Question:
We are tasked with finding the volume of the hemisphere. The radius is explicitly stated as 6.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Recall the Formula for the Volume of a Hemisphere
The volume \( V \) of a hemisphere is given by:
\[
V = \frac{2}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the hemisphere.

#### Step 2.2: Substitute the Given Radius
From the image and the predicates, the radius \( r \) is 6. Substituting \( r = 6 \) into the formula:
\[
V = \frac{2}{3} \pi (6)^3
\]

#### Step 2.3: Calculate \( 6^3 \)
\[
6^3 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216
\]

#### Step 2.4: Substitute Back and Simplify
\[
V = \frac{2}{3} \pi (216) = \frac{2 \times 216}{3} \pi = \frac{432}{3} \pi = 144 \pi
\]

#### Step 2.5: Approximate the Value
To find the numerical value, use \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
V \approx 144 \times 3.14159 = 452.389344
\]

#### Step 2.6: Round to Three Decimal Places
Rounding 452.389344 to three decimal places gives:
\[
V \approx 452.389
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of the hemisphere is \( 144\pi \) in exact form, and approximately 452.389 in decimal form. Since the question asks for the volume rounded to three decimal places, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{452.389}
\]
