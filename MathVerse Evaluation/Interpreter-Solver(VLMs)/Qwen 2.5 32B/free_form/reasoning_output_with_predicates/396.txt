### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Cues from the Image:
- The image depicts a circle.
- A line segment is drawn from the center of the circle to a point on its circumference, labeled as \( 11 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Predicates Analysis:
1. **Circle(A)**: There is a circle denoted by \( A \).
2. **IsRadiusOf(Line(B,C), Circle(A))**: The line segment \( \overline{BC} \) is the radius of the circle \( A \).
3. **LengthOf(Line(B,C))**: The length of the radius \( \overline{BC} \) is given as 11 cm.
4. **Equals(LengthOf(Line(B,C)), 11)**: The radius is explicitly stated to be 11 cm.
5. **PointLiesOnCircle(C, Circle(A))**: Point \( C \) lies on the circumference of the circle.
6. **Point(B)**: Point \( B \) is the center of the circle.
7. **AreaOf(A)**: We are tasked with finding the area of the circle \( A \).
8. **RadiusOf(A)**: The radius of the circle is 11 cm.
9. **Equals(RadiusOf(A), 11)**: This confirms that the radius of the circle is 11 cm.

#### Key Information Synthesis:
- The circle has a radius of \( 11 \, \text{cm} \).
- The task is to calculate the area of the circle.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Formula for the Area of a Circle
The area \( A \) of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
A = \pi r^2
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

#### Step 2.2: Substitute the Radius
From the predicates and the image, the radius \( r \) is explicitly given as 11 cm. Substituting \( r = 11 \) into the formula:
\[
A = \pi (11)^2
\]

#### Step 2.3: Simplify the Expression
Calculate \( 11^2 \):
\[
11^2 = 121
\]
Thus, the area becomes:
\[
A = \pi \cdot 121 = 121\pi
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The area of the circle is \( 121\pi \, \text{cm}^2 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{121\pi}
\]
