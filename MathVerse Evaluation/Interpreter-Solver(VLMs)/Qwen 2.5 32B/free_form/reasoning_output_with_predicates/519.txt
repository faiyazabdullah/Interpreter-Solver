QUESTION:
The function $f(x)=5 x-x^2$ in blue gives the number of mosquitos in the forest (in millions), and the function $g(x)=3 x-0.5 x^2$ in red gives the number of bats (in millions). In both equations $x$ represents rainfall (in centimeters). $g(x)$ goes through (0,0), (3,6), (6,0) and opens downward. $f(x)$ in blue goes through (0,0), (2,6), (3,6), (5,0) and opens downsward. When there is $0 \mathrm{~cm}$ of rainfall, the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats. What is another rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos is the same as the number of bats?
Round your answer to the nearest half centimeter.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Functions**:
   - \( f(x) = 5x - x^2 \): Represents the number of mosquitos (in millions).
   - \( g(x) = 3x - 0.5x^2 \): Represents the number of bats (in millions).
   - Both functions are quadratic and open downward.

2. **Points of Intersection**:
   - The image shows that the two curves intersect at two points:
     - At \( x = 0 \): Both \( f(0) = 0 \) and \( g(0) = 0 \).
     - At some other point where the curves cross again.

3. **Key Points**:
   - \( f(x) \) passes through: \((0, 0)\), \((2, 6)\), \((3, 6)\), \((5, 0)\).
   - \( g(x) \) passes through: \((0, 0)\), \((3, 6)\), \((6, 0)\).

4. **Question Goal**:
   - We need to find another rainfall amount \( x \) (besides \( x = 0 \)) where the number of mosquitos equals the number of bats. This corresponds to solving \( f(x) = g(x) \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Set Up the Equation \( f(x) = g(x) \)
From the given functions:
\[
f(x) = 5x - x^2
\]
\[
g(x) = 3x - 0.5x^2
\]
We set \( f(x) = g(x) \):
\[
5x - x^2 = 3x - 0.5x^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Simplify the Equation
Rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:
\[
5x - x^2 - 3x + 0.5x^2 = 0
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
(5x - 3x) + (-x^2 + 0.5x^2) = 0
\]
\[
2x - 0.5x^2 = 0
\]
Factor out \( x \):
\[
x(2 - 0.5x) = 0
\]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for \( x \)
The equation \( x(2 - 0.5x) = 0 \) gives two solutions:
1. \( x = 0 \)
2. \( 2 - 0.5x = 0 \)

Solve the second equation:
\[
2 - 0.5x = 0
\]
\[
0.5x = 2
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify the Solution
- The solution \( x = 0 \) is already given in the problem statement.
- The second solution \( x = 4 \) corresponds to another rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos equals the number of bats.

#### Step 2.5: Round to the Nearest Half Centimeter
The solution \( x = 4 \) is already an integer and does not require rounding.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The rainfall amount where the number of mosquitos equals the number of bats, besides \( x = 0 \), is \( x = 4 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
