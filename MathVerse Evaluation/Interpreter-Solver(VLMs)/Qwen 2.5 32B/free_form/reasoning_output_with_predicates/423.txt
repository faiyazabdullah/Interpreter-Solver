QUESTION:
After two meteoroids collide at point A, one starts travelling in the direction of point B, while the other starts travelling in the direction of point C, with an angle of 53^\circ  between the two directions. The meteoroid projected in the direction of B is moving at a speed of 7860 km/h, while the other is moving at a speed of 10170 km/h.


What distance will the meteoroid travelling towards point B have covered after 29 minutes?

### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves a geometric setup where two meteoroids collide at point \( A \). One meteoroid travels in the direction of point \( B \) with a speed of \( 7860 \, \text{km/h} \), and the other travels in the direction of point \( C \) with a speed of \( 10170 \, \text{km/h} \). The angle between the directions of travel is \( 53^\circ \). We are tasked with determining the distance traveled by the meteoroid moving towards point \( B \) after 29 minutes.

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
1. **Points and Directions**:
   - Point \( A \) is the collision point.
   - Point \( B \) is the direction of one meteoroid.
   - Point \( C \) is the direction of the other meteoroid.
   - The angle between the directions \( AB \) and \( AC \) is \( 53^\circ \).

2. **Speeds**:
   - Speed of the meteoroid traveling towards \( B \): \( 7860 \, \text{km/h} \).
   - Speed of the meteoroid traveling towards \( C \): \( 10170 \, \text{km/h} \).

3. **Time**:
   - Time elapsed: \( 29 \, \text{minutes} \).

4. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the distance traveled by the meteoroid moving towards point \( B \) after 29 minutes.

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Convert Time to Hours**:
   - The time given is \( 29 \, \text{minutes} \). Since speed is in kilometers per hour, we convert minutes to hours:
     \[
     29 \, \text{minutes} = \frac{29}{60} \, \text{hours}.
     \]

2. **Calculate Distance Traveled by Meteoroid Towards \( B \)**:
   - The distance traveled by an object is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}.
     \]
   - For the meteoroid traveling towards \( B \):
     \[
     \text{Speed}_B = 7860 \, \text{km/h}, \quad \text{Time} = \frac{29}{60} \, \text{hours}.
     \]
   - Substituting these values:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_B = 7860 \times \frac{29}{60}.
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   - First, simplify the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Distance}_B = 7860 \times \frac{29}{60} = \frac{7860 \times 29}{60}.
     \]
   - Calculate the numerator:
     \[
     7860 \times 29 = 227940.
     \]
   - Divide by 60:
     \[
     \frac{227940}{60} = 3799.
     \]

4. **Interpret the Result**:
   - The distance traveled by the meteoroid towards point \( B \) after 29 minutes is \( 3799 \, \text{km} \).

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3799 \, \text{km}}
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{3799 \, \text{km}}\]
