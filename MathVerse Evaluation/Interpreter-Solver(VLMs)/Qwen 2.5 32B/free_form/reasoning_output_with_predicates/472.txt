QUESTION:
The following graph shows a semicircle which passes (-7,0), (-5,-5), (0,7), (5,-5), (7,0).

State the centre of the semicircle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The image shows a semicircle in the Cartesian plane.
- The semicircle passes through the points \( (-7, 0) \), \( (-5, -5) \), \( (0, -7) \), \( (5, -5) \), and \( (7, 0) \).
- These points lie on the circumference of the semicircle.

#### Formal Predicates:
1. **Points**:
   - \( A = (-7, 0) \)
   - \( B = (-5, -5) \)
   - \( C = (0, -7) \)
   - \( D = (5, -5) \)
   - \( E = (7, 0) \)

2. **Circle**:
   - Circle \( 1 \) is defined such that points \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \) lie on it.

#### Key Observations:
- The semicircle is symmetric about the vertical axis (\( x \)-axis) because the given points \( A \) and \( E \) are mirror images across the \( y \)-axis, as are \( B \) and \( D \).
- The center of the semicircle must lie on the vertical axis (\( x = 0 \)) due to symmetry.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the radius of the semicircle.
- Since the semicircle passes through \( A = (-7, 0) \) and \( E = (7, 0) \), these points are endpoints of the diameter.
- The distance between \( A \) and \( E \) is the diameter of the semicircle:
  \[
  \text{Diameter} = \sqrt{(7 - (-7))^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{14^2} = 14.
  \]
  Therefore, the radius \( r \) is:
  \[
  r = \frac{\text{Diameter}}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7.
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Identify the center of the semicircle.
- Let the center of the semicircle be \( O = (0, y_c) \). Since the semicircle is symmetric about the vertical axis, the \( x \)-coordinate of the center is \( 0 \).
- To find \( y_c \), we use the fact that the distance from the center \( O \) to any point on the semicircle is equal to the radius \( r = 7 \).

##### Calculate \( y_c \) using point \( A = (-7, 0) \):
- The distance from \( O = (0, y_c) \) to \( A = (-7, 0) \) is the radius:
  \[
  \sqrt{(0 - (-7))^2 + (y_c - 0)^2} = 7.
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  \sqrt{7^2 + y_c^2} = 7 \implies \sqrt{49 + y_c^2} = 7.
  \]
  Square both sides:
  \[
  49 + y_c^2 = 49 \implies y_c^2 = 0 \implies y_c = 0.
  \]

##### Verify using point \( B = (-5, -5) \):
- The distance from \( O = (0, y_c) \) to \( B = (-5, -5) \) is the radius:
  \[
  \sqrt{(0 - (-5))^2 + (y_c - (-5))^2} = 7.
  \]
  Simplify:
  \[
  \sqrt{5^2 + (y_c + 5)^2} = 7 \implies \sqrt{25 + (y_c + 5)^2} = 7.
  \]
  Square both sides:
  \[
  25 + (y_c + 5)^2 = 49 \implies (y_c + 5)^2 = 24 \implies y_c + 5 = \pm \sqrt{24}.
  \]
  Since the semicircle is below the \( x \)-axis, \( y_c \) must be negative:
  \[
  y_c + 5 = -\sqrt{24} \implies y_c = -5 - \sqrt{24}.
  \]

However, we previously found \( y_c = 0 \) using point \( A \). This suggests a re-evaluation is needed. Upon closer inspection, the correct approach is to recognize that the center must satisfy all given points, and the symmetry argument holds true.

#### Step 2.3: Correct the center calculation.
- The center \( O \) must be directly above or below the midpoint of the diameter endpoints \( A \) and \( E \). The midpoint of \( A \) and \( E \) is:
  \[
  \left( \frac{-7 + 7}{2}, \frac{0 + 0}{2} \right) = (0, 0).
  \]
- The radius is 7, and the semicircle is below the \( x \)-axis, so the center is at \( (0, -7) \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The center of the semicircle is \( (0, -7) \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(0, -7)}\]
