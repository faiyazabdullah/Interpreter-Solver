### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Shape Identification**:
   - The figure consists of a **rectangular prism** at the bottom and a **triangular prism** on top.
   - The bottom rectangular prism has dimensions \(6 \, \text{m} \times 5 \, \text{m} \times 10 \, \text{m}\).
   - The top triangular prism has a triangular base and a height of \(3 \, \text{m}\).

2. **Dimensions**:
   - Length of the rectangular prism's base: \(10 \, \text{m}\).
   - Width of the rectangular prism's base: \(5 \, \text{m}\).
   - Height of the rectangular prism: \(6 \, \text{m}\).
   - Height of the triangular prism: \(3 \, \text{m}\).
   - The triangular base of the top prism is isosceles, and its sides are equal to \(3.81 \, \text{m}\).

3. **Geometric Relationships**:
   - The triangular base of the top prism is isosceles, meaning two sides are equal.
   - The third side of the triangle (base) lies along the width of the rectangular prism (\(5 \, \text{m}\)).
   - The marked edges of the triangular prism are congruent, confirming the isosceles nature of the triangle.

4. **Question Objective**:
   - Find the total surface area of the combined prism (rectangular prism + triangular prism).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Part 1: Surface Area of the Rectangular Prism
The surface area of a rectangular prism is given by:
\[
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{Rectangular Prism}} = 2lw + 2lh + 2wh
\]
where \(l = 10 \, \text{m}\), \(w = 5 \, \text{m}\), and \(h = 6 \, \text{m}\).

Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Surface Area}_{\text{Rectangular Prism}} = 2(10 \times 5) + 2(10 \times 6) + 2(5 \times 6)
\]
\[
= 2(50) + 2(60) + 2(30)
\]
\[
= 100 + 120 + 60
\]
\[
= 280 \, \text{m}^2
\]

However, since the top face of the rectangular prism is covered by the triangular prism, we exclude this face from the calculation. The top face area is:
\[
\text{Top Face Area} = l \times w = 10 \times 5 = 50 \, \text{m}^2
\]
Thus, the effective surface area of the rectangular prism is:
\[
\text{Effective Surface Area}_{\text{Rectangular Prism}} = 280 - 50 = 230 \, \text{m}^2
\]

#### Part 2: Surface Area of the Triangular Prism
The triangular prism consists of:
1. Two triangular bases.
2. Three rectangular lateral faces.

##### Step 2.1: Area of One Triangular Base
The triangular base is isosceles with:
- Base \(b = 5 \, \text{m}\).
- Equal sides \(s = 3.81 \, \text{m}\).

To find the area of the triangular base, we first calculate its height using the Pythagorean theorem. The height \(h_{\triangle}\) splits the base into two equal segments of \(2.5 \, \text{m}\) each. Thus:
\[
h_{\triangle} = \sqrt{s^2 - \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{3.81^2 - 2.5^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{14.5161 - 6.25}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{8.2661} \approx 2.88 \, \text{m}
\]
The area of one triangular base is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h_{\triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 \times 2.88 = 7.2 \, \text{m}^2
\]
Since there are two triangular bases, their total area is:
\[
\text{Total Area}_{\triangle} = 2 \times 7.2 = 14.4 \, \text{m}^2
\]

##### Step 2.2: Area of the Lateral Faces
The three lateral faces are rectangles. Their dimensions are:
1. Two lateral faces with dimensions \(3.81 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m}\).
2. One lateral face with dimensions \(5 \, \text{m} \times 3 \, \text{m}\).

The area of each lateral face is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{lateral face 1}} = 3.81 \times 3 = 11.43 \, \text{m}^2
\]
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{lateral face 2}} = 3.81 \times 3 = 11.43 \, \text{m}^2
\]
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{lateral face 3}} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \, \text{m}^2
\]
The total area of the lateral faces is:
\[
\text{Total Area}_{\text{lateral faces}} = 11.43 + 11.43 + 15 = 38.86 \, \text{m}^2
\]

##### Step 2.3: Total Surface Area of the Triangular Prism
The total surface area of the triangular prism is the sum of the areas of the two triangular bases and the three lateral faces:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area}_{\text{Triangular Prism}} = \text{Total Area}_{\triangle} + \text{Total Area}_{\text{lateral faces}}
\]
\[
= 14.4 + 38.86 = 53.26 \, \text{m}^2
\]

#### Part 3: Total Surface Area of the Combined Prism
The total surface area of the combined prism is the sum of the effective surface area of the rectangular prism and the total surface area of the triangular prism:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Effective Surface Area}_{\text{Rectangular Prism}} + \text{Total Surface Area}_{\text{Triangular Prism}}
\]
\[
= 230 + 53.26 = 283.26 \, \text{m}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the combined prism is:
\[
\boxed{283.26 \, \text{m}^2}
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{283.26}\]
