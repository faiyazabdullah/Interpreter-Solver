FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Elements from the Image:
1. The graph shows a Cartesian coordinate system with the origin at $(0, 0)$.
2. A vertical blue line is visible in the graph. This line is parallel to the $y$-axis and passes through a specific point on the $x$-axis.
3. From the visual inspection, the vertical line appears to pass through the point $(0, 0)$.

#### Formal Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(x,0))**: The point $(0, 0)$ lies on the $x$-axis.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,0), Line(0,y))**: The point $(0, 0)$ lies on the $y$-axis.
3. **Line(x,0)**: Represents the $x$-axis.
4. **Line(0,y)**: Represents the $y$-axis.
5. **Perpendicular(Line(x,0), Line(0,y))**: The $x$-axis and $y$-axis are perpendicular.
6. **Equals(0,0)**: Indicates that the coordinates $(0, 0)$ are equal, confirming the origin.

#### Key Observations:
- The vertical blue line in the graph is aligned with the $y$-axis.
- Since it passes through the origin $(0, 0)$, its equation must be of the form $x = c$, where $c$ is a constant.
- From the predicates and the image, the vertical line coincides with the $y$-axis, which has the equation $x = 0$.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

1. **Identify the Type of Line:**
   - The given line is vertical. By definition, a vertical line has a constant $x$-coordinate for all points on the line. Its general equation is $x = c$, where $c$ is a constant.

2. **Determine the Value of $c$:**
   - From the image, the vertical line passes through the origin $(0, 0)$.
   - Since the line is vertical and passes through $(0, 0)$, the $x$-coordinate of every point on the line is $0$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $x = 0$.

3. **Verify Perpendicularity:**
   - The predicate **Perpendicular(Line(x,0), Line(0,y))** confirms that the $x$-axis and $y$-axis are perpendicular. The vertical line coincides with the $y$-axis, so it is indeed perpendicular to the $x$-axis.

4. **Conclusion from Predicates and Geometry:**
   - The vertical line in the graph is the $y$-axis, which is defined by the equation $x = 0$.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The equation of the vertical blue line in the graph is $x = 0$.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{x = 0}\]
