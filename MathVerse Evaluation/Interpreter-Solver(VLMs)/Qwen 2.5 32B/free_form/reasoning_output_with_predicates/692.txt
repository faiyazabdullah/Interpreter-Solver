QUESTION:
A 13 cm concrete cylindrical pipe has an outer radius of 6 cm and an inner radius of 4 cm as shown. Find the volume of concrete required to make the pipe, correct to two decimal places.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Visual Elements and Predicates:
- The image depicts a hollow cylindrical pipe.
- The outer radius of the pipe is given as \( 6 \, \text{cm} \).
- The inner radius of the pipe is given as \( 4 \, \text{cm} \).
- The height (or length) of the cylinder is given as \( 13 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Key Relationships:
- The volume of a hollow cylinder is calculated as the difference between the volume of the outer cylinder and the volume of the inner cylinder.
- Volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:
  \[
  V = \pi r^2 h
  \]
  where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

#### Specific Value Requested:
- We need to find the volume of concrete required to make the pipe, which is the volume of the material forming the shell of the pipe.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Define Variables and Known Values
From the predicates and the image:
- Outer radius (\( R \)) = 6 cm
- Inner radius (\( r \)) = 4 cm
- Height (\( h \)) = 13 cm

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Volume of the Outer Cylinder
The volume of the outer cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{outer}} = \pi R^2 h
\]
Substitute \( R = 6 \) cm and \( h = 13 \) cm:
\[
V_{\text{outer}} = \pi (6)^2 (13) = \pi (36)(13) = 468\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Volume of the Inner Cylinder
The volume of the inner cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{inner}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
Substitute \( r = 4 \) cm and \( h = 13 \) cm:
\[
V_{\text{inner}} = \pi (4)^2 (13) = \pi (16)(13) = 208\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.4: Calculate the Volume of the Hollow Cylinder
The volume of the hollow cylinder (concrete required) is the difference between the volume of the outer cylinder and the volume of the inner cylinder:
\[
V_{\text{hollow}} = V_{\text{outer}} - V_{\text{inner}}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
V_{\text{hollow}} = 468\pi - 208\pi = 260\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.5: Approximate the Volume Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \)
To find the numerical value:
\[
V_{\text{hollow}} = 260\pi \approx 260 \times 3.14159 = 816.8134 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.6: Round to Two Decimal Places
Rounding \( 816.8134 \) to two decimal places gives:
\[
V_{\text{hollow}} \approx 816.81 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of concrete required to make the pipe is:
\[
\boxed{816.81 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
