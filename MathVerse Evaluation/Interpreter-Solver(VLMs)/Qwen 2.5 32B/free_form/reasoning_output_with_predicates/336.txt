### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- Point \( O \) is at the origin of a coordinate system.
- Point \( A \) is positioned such that the angle between the line \( OA \) and the north direction \( N \) is marked as \( 31^\circ \).
- The north direction \( N \) is aligned with the positive y-axis.

#### From Predicates:
1. **Point(A)**: There is a point labeled \( A \).
2. **Point(O)**: There is a point labeled \( O \), which is the origin.
3. **Line(O,A)**: There is a line segment connecting points \( O \) and \( A \).
4. **Angle(A,O,N)**: The angle formed by the line \( OA \) and the north direction \( N \) at point \( O \).
5. **MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,N))**: The measure of the angle \( \angle AON \).
6. **Equals(MeasureOf(Angle(A,O,N)), 31)**: The measure of \( \angle AON \) is \( 31^\circ \).

#### Key Observations:
- The angle \( \angle AON = 31^\circ \) is measured counterclockwise from the north direction \( N \) to the line \( OA \).
- The true bearing of point \( A \) from \( O \) is the clockwise angle measured from the north direction \( N \) to the line \( OA \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding True Bearing
- True bearing is defined as the clockwise angle measured from the north direction to the direction of interest.
- In the given problem, the angle \( \angle AON = 31^\circ \) is measured counterclockwise from the north direction \( N \). To find the true bearing, we need to convert this counterclockwise angle into a clockwise angle.

#### Step 2.2: Converting Counterclockwise Angle to True Bearing
- The total angle around a point is \( 360^\circ \).
- If an angle is measured counterclockwise from the north direction, its equivalent clockwise angle (true bearing) can be found using the formula:
  \[
  \text{True Bearing} = 360^\circ - \text{Counterclockwise Angle}
  \]
- Here, the counterclockwise angle is \( 31^\circ \). Therefore:
  \[
  \text{True Bearing} = 360^\circ - 31^\circ = 329^\circ
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Verifying the Result
- The true bearing \( 329^\circ \) corresponds to a direction that is \( 31^\circ \) west of north, which aligns with the counterclockwise angle given in the problem.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The true bearing of point \( A \) from \( O \) is \( 329^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{329^\circ}
\]
