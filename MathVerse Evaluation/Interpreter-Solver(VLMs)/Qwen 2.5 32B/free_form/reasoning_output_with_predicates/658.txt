QUESTION:
The diagram shows a water trough in the shape of a half cylinder. The height is 2.49 m and radius is 0.92 m.

Find the surface area of the outside of this water trough.

Round your answer to two decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The water trough is in the shape of a half-cylinder.
- The height of the trough corresponds to the length of the cylinder, which is given as \( 2.49 \) meters.
- The radius of the semicircular cross-section is given as \( 0.92 \) meters.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Shape(Trough)**: The trough is a half-cylinder.
2. **RadiusOf(Semicircle, Radius)**: The radius of the semicircle is \( 0.92 \) meters.
3. **LengthOf(Trough, Length)**: The length of the trough is \( 2.49 \) meters.
4. **Equals(Radius, 0.92)**: The radius is \( 0.92 \) meters.
5. **Equals(Length, 2.49)**: The length is \( 2.49 \) meters.
6. **Shape(Semicircle)**: The cross-section is a semicircle.
7. **Shape(Rectangle)**: The rectangular part of the trough contributes to the surface area.
8. **AreaOf(SemicircleArea)**: The curved surface area of the semicircle needs to be calculated.
9. **AreaOf(RectangleArea)**: The area of the rectangular part needs to be calculated.
10. **LengthOf(Rectangle, Length)**: The length of the rectangle is the same as the length of the trough.
11. **WidthOf(Rectangle, Diameter)**: The width of the rectangle is the diameter of the semicircle.
12. **IsRadiusOf(Radius, Semicircle)**: The radius defines the semicircle.
13. **IsDiameterOf(Diameter, Semicircle)**: The diameter is twice the radius.
14. **Equals(Diameter, Mul(2, Radius))**: The diameter is \( 2 \times \text{radius} \).
15. **Mul(Pi, Radius, Length, CurvedSurfaceArea)**: The curved surface area of the semicircle is calculated as \( \pi \times \text{radius} \times \text{length} \).
16. **Mul(Length, Diameter, RectangleArea)**: The area of the rectangle is \( \text{length} \times \text{diameter} \).
17. **Add(CurvedSurfaceArea, RectangleArea, TotalSurfaceArea)**: The total surface area is the sum of the curved surface area and the rectangular area.

#### Key Measurements:
- Radius (\( R \)): \( 0.92 \) meters.
- Length (\( L \)): \( 2.49 \) meters.
- Diameter (\( D \)): \( 2 \times R = 2 \times 0.92 = 1.84 \) meters.

#### What We Need to Find:
The surface area of the outside of the water trough, which includes:
1. The curved surface area of the semicircular part.
2. The rectangular area at the base.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Curved Surface Area
The curved surface area of the half-cylinder is given by:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area} = \pi \times R \times L
\]
Substitute \( R = 0.92 \) meters and \( L = 2.49 \) meters:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area} = \pi \times 0.92 \times 2.49
\]
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area} = 3.14159 \times 0.92 \times 2.49 \approx 7.07 \text{ m}^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Rectangular Area
The rectangular area is given by:
\[
\text{Rectangular Area} = L \times D
\]
The diameter \( D \) is:
\[
D = 2 \times R = 2 \times 0.92 = 1.84 \text{ meters}
\]
Substitute \( L = 2.49 \) meters and \( D = 1.84 \) meters:
\[
\text{Rectangular Area} = 2.49 \times 1.84 \approx 4.58 \text{ m}^2
\]

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Total Surface Area
The total surface area is the sum of the curved surface area and the rectangular area:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area} + \text{Rectangular Area}
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 7.07 + 4.58 = 11.65 \text{ m}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the outside of the water trough is:
\[
\boxed{11.65 \text{ m}^2}
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{11.65 \text{ m}^2}\]
