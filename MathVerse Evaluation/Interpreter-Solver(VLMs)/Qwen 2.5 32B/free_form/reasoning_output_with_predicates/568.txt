QUESTION:
Function f in blue is a parabola as $y=x^2$. Function g in red can be thought of as a translated (shifted) version of f(x)=x^2. Write the equation for g(x).

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the equation of the red parabola \( g(x) \), which is a translation of the blue parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \). The key information provided includes:
1. The blue parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \) has its vertex at \( A(0, 0) \).
2. The red parabola \( g(x) \) has its vertex at \( B(-3, -5) \).
3. Both parabolas are translations of each other, meaning the red parabola is a shifted version of the blue parabola.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the predicates and the image:
- The blue parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \) is given, and its vertex is at \( A(0, 0) \).
- The red parabola \( g(x) \) is a translation of \( f(x) \), and its vertex is at \( B(-3, -5) \).
- Translations of a function \( f(x) \) are represented as \( f(x - h) + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the translation vector.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify the Translation Vector
The vertex of the blue parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \) is at \( (0, 0) \). The vertex of the red parabola \( g(x) \) is at \( (-3, -5) \). Therefore, the translation vector is:
\[
(h, k) = (-3, -5)
\]
This means the red parabola \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the blue parabola \( f(x) = x^2 \) horizontally by \( -3 \) units (leftward) and vertically by \( -5 \) units (downward).

#### Step 2.2: Apply the Translation to the Function
The general form of a translated function is:
\[
g(x) = f(x - h) + k
\]
Here, \( f(x) = x^2 \), \( h = -3 \), and \( k = -5 \). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
g(x) = f(x - (-3)) + (-5) = f(x + 3) - 5
\]
Since \( f(x) = x^2 \), we substitute \( f(x + 3) \) with \( (x + 3)^2 \):
\[
g(x) = (x + 3)^2 - 5
\]

#### Step 2.3: Verify the Vertex of \( g(x) \)
To confirm, we check the vertex of \( g(x) = (x + 3)^2 - 5 \). The vertex form of a parabola \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \) has its vertex at \( (h, k) \). Here, \( g(x) = (x + 3)^2 - 5 \) can be written as:
\[
g(x) = (x - (-3))^2 + (-5)
\]
Thus, the vertex is \( (-3, -5) \), which matches the given vertex of the red parabola.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The equation of the red parabola \( g(x) \) is:
\[
g(x) = (x + 3)^2 - 5
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{g(x) = (x + 3)^2 - 5}
\]
