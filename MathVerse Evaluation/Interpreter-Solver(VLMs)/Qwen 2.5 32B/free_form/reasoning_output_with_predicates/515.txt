QUESTION:
The graph shows the amount of water remaining in a bucket that was initially full before a hole was made in its side. What is the slope of the shown function that passes (0, 30)?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given graph depicts the relationship between the quantity of water remaining in a bucket (in litres) and time (in minutes). The question asks us to determine the slope of the linear function that describes this relationship. The function passes through the points \((0, 30)\) and \((44, 8)\).

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
- **Key Points from the Graph**:
  - The function passes through the point \((0, 30)\), which means at \(t = 0\) minutes, the quantity of water is 30 litres.
  - The function also passes through the point \((44, 8)\), which means at \(t = 44\) minutes, the quantity of water is 8 litres.
  
- **Formal Predicates**:
  - PointLiesOnLine(Point((0,30)), Line(l)): The point \((0, 30)\) lies on the line \(l\).
  - PointLiesOnLine(Point((44,8)), Line(l)): The point \((44, 8)\) lies on the line \(l\).
  
- **Objective**:
  - Calculate the slope of the line \(l\) that passes through the points \((0, 30)\) and \((44, 8)\).

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the General Formula for Slope**:
   The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Here, \((x_1, y_1) = (0, 30)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (44, 8)\).

2. **Substitute the Coordinates**:
   - \(x_1 = 0\), \(y_1 = 30\)
   - \(x_2 = 44\), \(y_2 = 8\)
   Substituting these values into the slope formula:
   \[
   m = \frac{8 - 30}{44 - 0} = \frac{-22}{44}
   \]

3. **Simplify the Expression**:
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   m = \frac{-22}{44} = -\frac{1}{2}
   \]

4. **Interpret the Result**:
   - The negative slope indicates that the quantity of water is decreasing over time, which is consistent with the context of water leaking from a bucket.
   - The magnitude of the slope, \(\frac{1}{2}\), means that the quantity of water decreases by 0.5 litres per minute.

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The slope of the line that passes through the points \((0, 30)\) and \((44, 8)\) is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{1}{2}}
\]
