QUESTION:
In the figure above, the seven small circles, which have equal radii, and the large circle share only those points on the circles that are marked. Point P is the center of the large circle and PA and PB are radii. The area of the shaded portion is how many times the area of one of the small circles?

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining how many times the area of the shaded portion is compared to the area of one of the small circles. The given setup includes:
1. A large circle centered at point \( P \).
2. Seven smaller circles, each congruent to one another, and tangent to the large circle and to their neighboring small circles.
3. Two sectors of the large circle are shaded, specifically the sectors \( \text{Sector}(P, A, \theta) \) and \( \text{Sector}(P, B, \theta) \).

From the predicates:
- All small circles are congruent.
- The large circle's center is \( P \).
- Radii \( PA \) and \( PB \) are radii of the large circle.
- The shaded regions are sectors of the large circle.

### Step 1: Key Observations and Relationships
#### 1. Geometry of the Small Circles
- Let the radius of each small circle be \( r \). Since all small circles are congruent, their radii are equal.
- The centers of the small circles form a regular hexagon around the center \( P \) of the large circle. This is because the small circles are tangent to each other and to the large circle.
- The distance from the center \( P \) of the large circle to the center of any small circle is \( r + r = 2r \) (since the radius of the large circle is the sum of the radius of a small circle and the distance from the center of a small circle to its point of tangency with the large circle).

#### 2. Radius of the Large Circle
- The radius of the large circle is the distance from \( P \) to any point on its circumference. From the configuration, this radius is equal to the distance from \( P \) to the farthest point on the outer edge of the small circles, which is \( 3r \) (the radius of the large circle is the sum of the radius of a small circle and the distance from the center of a small circle to the edge of the large circle, i.e., \( r + 2r = 3r \)).

#### 3. Shaded Sectors
- The shaded regions are two sectors of the large circle. Each sector has a central angle of \( 60^\circ \) (since the centers of the small circles form a regular hexagon, and each internal angle of a regular hexagon is \( 120^\circ \), making each sector \( 60^\circ \)).
- The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of these two sectors.

### Step 2: Calculations
#### 1. Area of One Small Circle
The area of one small circle is:
\[
\text{Area of one small circle} = \pi r^2
\]

#### 2. Area of the Large Circle
The radius of the large circle is \( 3r \). Therefore, the area of the large circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the large circle} = \pi (3r)^2 = 9\pi r^2
\]

#### 3. Area of Each Shaded Sector
Each shaded sector has a central angle of \( 60^\circ \). The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of a sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \text{Area of the circle}
\]
For each \( 60^\circ \) sector of the large circle:
\[
\text{Area of one sector} = \frac{60^\circ}{360^\circ} \times 9\pi r^2 = \frac{1}{6} \times 9\pi r^2 = \frac{3\pi r^2}{2}
\]
Since there are two such sectors, the total shaded area is:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = 2 \times \frac{3\pi r^2}{2} = 3\pi r^2
\]

#### 4. Comparison of Areas
The area of the shaded portion is \( 3\pi r^2 \), and the area of one small circle is \( \pi r^2 \). Therefore, the shaded area is:
\[
\frac{\text{Shaded area}}{\text{Area of one small circle}} = \frac{3\pi r^2}{\pi r^2} = 3
\]

### Final Answer:
The area of the shaded portion is 3 times the area of one of the small circles.

\[
\boxed{3}
\]
