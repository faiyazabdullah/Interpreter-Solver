QUESTION:
There are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Elements from the Image:
- The image shows a number line with two labeled points: one at $-2$ and another at $-1$.
- Both points are open circles, indicating that these points are not included in the set of numbers being represented.

#### Formal Predicates:
1. **Point(-2)**: There is a point at $-2$ on the number line.
2. **Point(1)**: There is a point at $1$ on the number line.
3. **Line(-2,1)**: There is a line segment connecting the points $-2$ and $1$.

#### Key Observations:
- The open circles at $-2$ and $-1$ indicate that the set of numbers does not include these endpoints.
- The line segment between $-2$ and $-1$ suggests that the set includes all numbers strictly between $-2$ and $-1$.

#### Specific Question:
We are asked to write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation. Based on the open circles, the set excludes the endpoints $-2$ and $-1$.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Interpret Open Circles
- An open circle at a point on a number line indicates that the point is not included in the set.
- Since there are open circles at $-2$ and $-1$, the set of numbers does not include $-2$ or $-1$.

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Interval
- The line segment connects $-2$ and $-1$, which means the set includes all real numbers strictly between $-2$ and $-1$.
- In interval notation, excluding the endpoints is represented using parentheses: $(a, b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are the endpoints.

#### Step 2.3: Combine Observations
- The set of numbers represented on the number line is all real numbers strictly greater than $-2$ and strictly less than $-1$.
- This is expressed in interval notation as $( -2, -1 )$.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The set of numbers represented on the number line, based on the given predicates and visual information, is the interval $( -2, -1 )$.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(-2, -1)}
\]
