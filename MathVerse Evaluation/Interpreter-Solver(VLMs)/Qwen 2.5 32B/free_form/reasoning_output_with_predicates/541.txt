QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $(1,1.5)$ and an amplitude of 1.5. What is the midline equation of the function?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The graph depicts a trigonometric function with a periodic nature.
2. The function has a minimum point at \((1, 1.5)\).
3. The amplitude of the function is given as \(1.5\).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Point \(A\)** is defined such that:
   - \(A = (1, 1.5)\)
   - \(ValueYof(A) = 1.5\)
   - \(ValueXof(A) = 1\)

#### Key Observations:
- The minimum point of the function is \((1, 1.5)\).
- The amplitude of the function is \(1.5\), which means the maximum deviation from the midline is \(1.5\) units.
- The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that lies halfway between its maximum and minimum values.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Midline
The midline of a trigonometric function is the horizontal line that passes through the center of the oscillation. It is the average of the maximum and minimum values of the function.

Let:
- \(M_{\text{max}}\) be the maximum value of the function.
- \(M_{\text{min}}\) be the minimum value of the function.
- The midline is given by:
  \[
  y = \frac{M_{\text{max}} + M_{\text{min}}}{2}
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Identifying the Minimum Value
From the problem, the minimum value of the function is given by the \(y\)-coordinate of the minimum point:
\[
M_{\text{min}} = 1.5
\]

#### Step 2.3: Determining the Maximum Value
The amplitude of the function is \(1.5\). The amplitude is the distance from the midline to either the maximum or minimum value. Since the minimum value is \(1.5\), the maximum value can be calculated as:
\[
M_{\text{max}} = M_{\text{min}} + 2 \times \text{Amplitude}
\]
However, in this case, the amplitude is the vertical distance from the midline to the minimum or maximum. Thus:
\[
M_{\text{max}} = M_{\text{min}} + \text{Amplitude}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
M_{\text{max}} = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3
\]

#### Step 2.4: Calculating the Midline
The midline is the average of the maximum and minimum values:
\[
y = \frac{M_{\text{max}} + M_{\text{min}}}{2} = \frac{3 + 1.5}{2} = \frac{4.5}{2} = 2.25
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The midline of the function is the horizontal line \(y = 2.25\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y = 2.25}
\]
