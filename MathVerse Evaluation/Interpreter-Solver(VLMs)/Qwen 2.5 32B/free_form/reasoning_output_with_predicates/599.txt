QUESTION:
The graph shows $y_1=x^3$ passing (0,0) and a vertical or horizontal translation $y_2$ passing (-2,0). The blue line is solid while the red line is dotted. Write an equation for $y_2$ as shown in the graph.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. The blue line represents the function \( y_1 = x^3 \).
2. The red line represents a transformation of \( y_1 \), specifically a horizontal shift.
3. The red line passes through the point \((-2, 0)\), which is a key feature of the transformation.

#### Formal Predicates:
- \( y_1 = x^3 \): This is the base cubic function.
- \( y_2 = \text{Pow}(x + 2, 3) \): This indicates that \( y_2 \) is a horizontal shift of \( y_1 \) by 2 units to the left.
- The point \((-2, 0)\) lies on the red line \( y_2 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding Horizontal Shifts
A horizontal shift of a function \( f(x) \) by \( h \) units to the left is represented by \( f(x + h) \). In this case:
- The original function is \( y_1 = x^3 \).
- The transformed function \( y_2 \) is given as \( y_2 = \text{Pow}(x + 2, 3) \), which means \( y_2 = (x + 2)^3 \).

#### Step 2.2: Verifying the Point \((-2, 0)\)
To confirm that the red line \( y_2 \) passes through \((-2, 0)\), substitute \( x = -2 \) into \( y_2 = (x + 2)^3 \):
\[
y_2 = ((-2) + 2)^3 = (0)^3 = 0
\]
Thus, the point \((-2, 0)\) satisfies the equation \( y_2 = (x + 2)^3 \).

#### Step 2.3: Confirming the Transformation
The transformation described by \( y_2 = (x + 2)^3 \) is a horizontal shift of the function \( y_1 = x^3 \) to the left by 2 units. This matches the visual representation in the graph, where the red line is shifted left compared to the blue line.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The equation for the red line \( y_2 \) is \( y_2 = (x + 2)^3 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y_2 = (x + 2)^3}
\]
