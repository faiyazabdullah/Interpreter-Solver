### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Analysis:
- The image depicts a rectangular prism.
- The dimensions are labeled:
  - Length of the base: $(x+4) \, \text{m}$.
  - Width of the base: $(x+8) \, \text{m}$.
  - Height of the prism: $12 \, \text{m}$.

#### Predicate Analysis:
1. **Rectangle(Base)**: The base of the prism is a rectangle.
2. **LengthOf(Base, x+4)**: The length of the base is $(x+4) \, \text{m}$.
3. **Rectangle(Side)**: The side of the prism is a rectangle.
4. **LengthOf(Side, x+8)**: The width of the base is $(x+8) \, \text{m}$.
5. **HeightOf(Prism, 12)**: The height of the prism is $12 \, \text{m}$.
6. **Shape(Prism)**: The overall shape is a rectangular prism.
7. **Mul(x+4, x+8, BaseArea)**: The area of the base is given by the product $(x+4)(x+8)$.
8. **Mul(BaseArea, 12, Volume)**: The volume of the prism is the product of the base area and the height.

#### Key Measurements:
- Length of the base: $(x+4) \, \text{m}$.
- Width of the base: $(x+8) \, \text{m}$.
- Height of the prism: $12 \, \text{m}$.

#### Question:
We are asked to write a fully expanded and simplified expression for the volume of the prism.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Calculate the Base Area
The base of the prism is a rectangle with dimensions $(x+4) \, \text{m}$ and $(x+8) \, \text{m}$. The area of the base is given by the product of these two dimensions:
\[
\text{Base Area} = (x+4)(x+8).
\]
Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
\[
(x+4)(x+8) = x^2 + 8x + 4x + 32 = x^2 + 12x + 32.
\]
Thus, the base area is:
\[
\text{Base Area} = x^2 + 12x + 32.
\]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Volume of the Prism
The volume of a rectangular prism is given by the product of the base area and the height. From the predicates, the height of the prism is $12 \, \text{m}$. Therefore:
\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Height}.
\]
Substituting the base area and height:
\[
\text{Volume} = (x^2 + 12x + 32) \times 12.
\]
Distribute $12$ across each term in the polynomial:
\[
\text{Volume} = 12x^2 + 144x + 384.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The fully expanded and simplified expression for the volume of the prism is:
\[
\text{Volume} = 12x^2 + 144x + 384.
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{12x^2 + 144x + 384}
\]
