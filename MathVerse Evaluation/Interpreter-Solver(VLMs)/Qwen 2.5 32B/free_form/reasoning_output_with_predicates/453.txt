### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the coordinates of the center of a circle that intersects the coordinate axes at four points. The given predicates indicate that there are four points lying on the circle, and the image shows a circle centered within the Cartesian plane.

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
1. **Predicates Analysis**:
   - `Circle(1)` indicates the existence of a single circle.
   - `PointLiesOnCircle(Point(A), Circle(1))`, `PointLiesOnCircle(Point(B), Circle(1))`, etc., imply that there are specific points on the circle. However, these points are not explicitly labeled in the image, but their existence is implied.

2. **Visual Cues from the Image**:
   - The circle intersects the coordinate axes at four distinct points.
   - The circle is symmetric about its center.
   - The center of the circle appears to be equidistant from the intersections with the axes.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The circle's symmetry suggests that its center lies at the midpoint of the segments connecting opposite intersection points on the axes.
   - The intersections with the axes provide clues about the radius and the center's position.

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify Intersection Points**:
   - From the image, the circle intersects the x-axis at two points: approximately \((-2, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\).
   - Similarly, the circle intersects the y-axis at two points: approximately \((0, 2)\) and \((0, -2)\).

2. **Determine the Center**:
   - The center of a circle is the midpoint of the line segment joining any two opposite intersection points.
   - Consider the points \((-2, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\) on the x-axis. The midpoint of these points is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{-2 + 2}{2}, \frac{0 + 0}{2} \right) = (0, 0)
     \]
   - Now consider the points \((0, 2)\) and \((0, -2)\) on the y-axis. The midpoint of these points is:
     \[
     \left( \frac{0 + 0}{2}, \frac{2 + (-2)}{2} \right) = (0, 0)
     \]
   - Both calculations confirm that the center of the circle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

3. **Verify Symmetry**:
   - The circle is symmetric about the origin, and the distances from the center to the intersection points on the axes are equal, confirming that the center is indeed \((0, 0)\).

#### Step 3: Conclusion
The center of the circle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{(0, 0)}
\]
