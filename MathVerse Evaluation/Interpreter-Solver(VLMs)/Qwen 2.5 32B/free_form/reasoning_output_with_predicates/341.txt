### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( A \) in the given geometric configuration. The key elements provided are:
1. Triangle \( \triangle ABC \).
2. Angle measures:
   - \( \angle BAC = 42^\circ \).
   - \( \angle ABC = 53^\circ \).
   - \( \angle ACB = 85^\circ \).

The goal is to determine the true bearing of point \( C \) from point \( A \). True bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Analyze the Geometry**
From the image and predicates:
- Points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) form a triangle.
- The angles at points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are given as \( 42^\circ \), \( 53^\circ \), and \( 85^\circ \), respectively.
- The sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \), which is consistent with the given values:
  \[
  42^\circ + 53^\circ + 85^\circ = 180^\circ.
  \]

#### **Step 2: Determine the Orientation**
The problem involves finding the true bearing of \( C \) from \( A \). To do this, we need to consider the direction of \( \overrightarrow{AC} \) relative to the north direction.

- The angle \( \angle BAC = 42^\circ \) is given as the angle between the positive \( x \)-axis (east direction) and the line segment \( \overrightarrow{AB} \).
- Since the bearings are measured clockwise from the north, we need to convert this angle into a bearing.

#### **Step 3: Convert Angles to Bearings**
To find the true bearing of \( C \) from \( A \):
1. The angle \( \angle BAC = 42^\circ \) indicates that \( \overrightarrow{AB} \) is \( 42^\circ \) east of north.
2. The angle \( \angle ACB = 85^\circ \) is the internal angle at \( C \), but it does not directly affect the bearing calculation.
3. The true bearing of \( C \) from \( A \) is determined by the direction of \( \overrightarrow{AC} \).

Since \( \overrightarrow{AC} \) is part of the triangle and \( \angle BAC = 42^\circ \) is the angle between \( \overrightarrow{AB} \) and the positive \( x \)-axis, the true bearing of \( C \) from \( A \) is simply \( 42^\circ \) east of north.

#### **Step 4: Express the Bearing**
True bearings are measured clockwise from the north direction. Therefore:
- The true bearing of \( C \) from \( A \) is \( 90^\circ - 42^\circ = 48^\circ \) east of north.

Thus, the true bearing of \( C \) from \( A \) is \( 48^\circ \) east of north, or simply \( 48^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{48^\circ}
\]
