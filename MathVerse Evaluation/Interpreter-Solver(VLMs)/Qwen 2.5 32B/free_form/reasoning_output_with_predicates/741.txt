QUESTION:
A cylinder has a surface area of 54105 \mathrm{mm}^2 and a radius of 79 mm.

What must the height h mm of the cylinder be?

Round your answer to the nearest whole number.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

From the given predicates and the image:
1. The figure represents a cylinder.
2. The top and bottom faces of the cylinder are circles (denoted as \( C1 \) and \( C2 \)).
3. The radius of both circles is given as 79 mm:  
   \[
   \text{RadiusOf}(C1) = 79 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{RadiusOf}(C2) = 79.
   \]
4. The height of the cylinder is denoted as \( h \):  
   \[
   \text{HeightOf}(R1) = h.
   \]
5. The total surface area of the cylinder is given as 54105 mm²:  
   \[
   \text{AreaOf}(\text{Cylinder}) = 54105.
   \]

The task is to determine the height \( h \) of the cylinder.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### **Step 2.1: Formula for the Surface Area of a Cylinder**
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh,
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the circular bases,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

From the problem:
- The radius \( r = 79 \) mm,
- The total surface area \( A = 54105 \) mm².

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
54105 = 2\pi (79)^2 + 2\pi (79)h.
\]

#### **Step 2.2: Simplify the Equation**
First, calculate \( (79)^2 \):
\[
79^2 = 6241.
\]
Substitute \( 79^2 = 6241 \) into the equation:
\[
54105 = 2\pi (6241) + 2\pi (79)h.
\]
Factor out \( 2\pi \):
\[
54105 = 2\pi (6241 + 79h).
\]

#### **Step 2.3: Solve for \( h \)**
Divide both sides of the equation by \( 2\pi \):
\[
\frac{54105}{2\pi} = 6241 + 79h.
\]
Calculate \( \frac{54105}{2\pi} \). Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\frac{54105}{2\pi} = \frac{54105}{2 \times 3.14159} \approx \frac{54105}{6.28318} \approx 8600.
\]
So:
\[
8600 = 6241 + 79h.
\]
Isolate \( h \) by subtracting 6241 from both sides:
\[
8600 - 6241 = 79h,
\]
\[
2359 = 79h.
\]
Solve for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{2359}{79}.
\]
Perform the division:
\[
h \approx 29.86.
\]

#### **Step 2.4: Round to the Nearest Whole Number**
The height \( h \) is approximately 29.86 mm. Rounding to the nearest whole number:
\[
h \approx 30.
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The height of the cylinder is approximately 30 mm. Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
