QUESTION:
Consider the following figure. The base is a triangle with two side of the same length 10cm and one side of length 12cm. The height of the prism is 16cm.

Use Pythagoras' Theorem to find the unknown height $x$ in the triangular prism shown.

### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the unknown height \( x \) of a right triangle that forms the base of a triangular prism. The given information includes:
- The base of the triangle is 12 cm.
- The two equal sides of the isosceles triangle are each 10 cm.
- The height of the prism is 16 cm (irrelevant for finding \( x \)).
- The triangle is isosceles and contains a right angle at the altitude dropped from the apex to the base.

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
1. The triangle is isosceles with two sides of length 10 cm and a base of 12 cm.
2. The height \( x \) is the altitude of the triangle, which is also the perpendicular distance from the apex to the base.
3. The base is divided into two equal segments of 6 cm each because the altitude of an isosceles triangle bisects the base.
4. We need to use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( x \).

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
1. **Identify the Right Triangle:**
   - The altitude \( x \) forms a right triangle with half of the base (6 cm) and one of the equal sides (10 cm).
   - This right triangle has:
     - One leg = \( x \) (the unknown height),
     - Another leg = 6 cm (half of the base),
     - Hypotenuse = 10 cm (one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle).

2. **Apply the Pythagorean Theorem:**
   - The Pythagorean theorem states: \( \text{Hypotenuse}^2 = \text{Leg}_1^2 + \text{Leg}_2^2 \).
   - Here, the hypotenuse is 10 cm, and the legs are \( x \) and 6 cm.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     10^2 = x^2 + 6^2
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     100 = x^2 + 36
     \]
   - Isolate \( x^2 \):
     \[
     x^2 = 100 - 36
     \]
     \[
     x^2 = 64
     \]
   - Take the square root of both sides:
     \[
     x = \sqrt{64}
     \]
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The unknown height \( x \) of the triangular prism is 8 cm.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
