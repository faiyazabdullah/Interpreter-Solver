QUESTION:
Two linear functions are graphed. The slope of function is less than 0. It intersects the x-axis at (4,0) and the y-axis at (0,4). Consider the graph of $y=4-x$.

If the graph is translated 10 units up, what will be the coordinates of the new $y$-intercept?

State the coordinates in the form $(a, b)$.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information:
- The graph shows a straight line representing the equation \( y = 4 - x \).
- The line intersects the x-axis at the point \( (4, 0) \).
- The line intersects the y-axis at the point \( (0, 4) \).

#### Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point((4,0)), Line($))**: The point \( (4, 0) \) lies on the line.
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point((0,4)), Line($))**: The point \( (0, 4) \) lies on the line.
3. **Line(x, y)**: The line is defined by the equation \( y = 4 - x \).
4. **Equals(y, Sub(4, x))**: The equation of the line is \( y = 4 - x \).
5. **Perpendicular(Line(x, $), Line(y, $))**: This predicate suggests that two lines are perpendicular, but it is not directly relevant to the current problem since we are only dealing with one line.

#### Key Observations:
- The given line has a slope of \(-1\) (since the equation is \( y = 4 - x \)).
- The y-intercept of the original line is \( (0, 4) \).

#### Question:
We need to determine the new y-intercept after translating the graph of \( y = 4 - x \) upward by 10 units.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding Translation
- Translating a graph upward by 10 units means adding 10 to the y-coordinate of every point on the graph.
- The general equation of the line is \( y = 4 - x \).
- After translating the graph upward by 10 units, the new equation becomes:
  \[
  y = (4 - x) + 10
  \]
  Simplifying this, we get:
  \[
  y = 14 - x
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Finding the New Y-Intercept
- The y-intercept occurs where the line crosses the y-axis, i.e., when \( x = 0 \).
- Substitute \( x = 0 \) into the new equation \( y = 14 - x \):
  \[
  y = 14 - 0 = 14
  \]
- Therefore, the new y-intercept is \( (0, 14) \).

#### Step 2.3: Verifying the Translation
- The original y-intercept was \( (0, 4) \).
- Translating this point upward by 10 units results in:
  \[
  (0, 4 + 10) = (0, 14)
  \]
- This confirms that the new y-intercept is indeed \( (0, 14) \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The coordinates of the new y-intercept after translating the graph of \( y = 4 - x \) upward by 10 units are \( (0, 14) \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{(0, 14)}\]
