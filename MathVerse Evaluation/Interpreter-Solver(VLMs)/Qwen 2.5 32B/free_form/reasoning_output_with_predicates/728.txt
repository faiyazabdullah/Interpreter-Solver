### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Shape Identification**: The image depicts a cube, and the predicate `Shape(cube1)` confirms that the figure is indeed a cube.
2. **Side Length**: The image indicates that each side of the cube has a length of 12 cm. This is further confirmed by the predicate `Equals(LengthOf(side1, cube1), 12)`.
3. **Dimensions of the Cube**:
   - The predicate `Equals(HeightOf(cube1), LengthOf(side1, cube1))` states that the height of the cube is equal to the length of its side.
   - Similarly, `Equals(WidthOf(cube1), LengthOf(side1, cube1))` states that the width is also equal to the length of its side.
   - Finally, `Equals(BaseOf(cube1), LengthOf(side1, cube1))` states that the base dimension is equal to the length of its side.
4. **Objective**: The problem asks us to find the volume of the cube. The predicate `VolumeOf(cube1)` indicates that we need to compute the volume.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Understanding the Cube's Dimensions
From the predicates and the image:
- All sides of the cube are equal.
- The side length of the cube is given as 12 cm.
- Therefore, the height, width, and base dimensions of the cube are all 12 cm.

#### Step 2.2: Formula for the Volume of a Cube
The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[
V = \text{side length}^3
\]
Here, the side length is 12 cm.

#### Step 2.3: Substituting the Side Length into the Formula
Using the given side length:
\[
V = 12^3
\]
Calculate \( 12^3 \):
\[
12^3 = 12 \times 12 \times 12 = 144 \times 12 = 1728
\]

#### Step 2.4: Incorporating Units
Since the side length is given in centimeters, the volume will be in cubic centimeters (\(\text{cm}^3\)).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of the cube is:
\[
\boxed{1728 \text{ cm}^3}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{1728 \text{ cm}^3}
\]
