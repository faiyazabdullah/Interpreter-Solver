QUESTION:
The graph shows the cost, in dollars, of a phone call for different call durations. The x-axis represents call length (minutes), and the y-axis represents call cost.

What is the average rate of change?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The given graph depicts the relationship between call length (in minutes) and call cost (in dollars). The x-axis represents call length, and the y-axis represents call cost. Two points are identified on the graph:
- Point \( A \): When the call length is 10 minutes, the call cost is 10 dollars.
- Point \( B \): When the call length is 20 minutes, the call cost is 19 dollars.

The question asks for the **average rate of change** of the call cost with respect to call length. This is equivalent to finding the slope of the line passing through these two points.

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
From the image and predicates:
1. The x-axis represents call length (in minutes).
2. The y-axis represents call cost (in dollars).
3. The line passes through the points:
   - \( A(10, 10) \): Call length = 10 minutes, Call cost = 10 dollars.
   - \( B(20, 19) \): Call length = 20 minutes, Call cost = 19 dollars.
4. The average rate of change is the slope of the line passing through these points.

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**
To find the average rate of change, we use the formula for the slope of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \):
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Here:
- \( (x_1, y_1) = (10, 10) \)
- \( (x_2, y_2) = (20, 19) \)

Substitute the coordinates into the formula:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{19 - 10}{20 - 10}
\]

Calculate the numerator and denominator:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{9}{10}
\]

Thus, the average rate of change is \( \frac{9}{10} \) dollars per minute.

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
The average rate of change of the call cost with respect to call length is \( \frac{9}{10} \) dollars per minute.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{9}{10}}
\]
