QUESTION:
Let us find the surface area of the solid given (constructed by removing a hemisphere from a cylinder). The radius is 15 cm. The height of cylinder is 22 cm.

Hence, find the total surface area of the shape.

Give our answer to two decimal places.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual and Predicate Analysis:
- **Image Description**: The figure shows a cylinder from which a hemisphere has been removed. The cylinder has a base radius of 15 cm and a height of 22 cm. The hemisphere that was removed has the same radius as the cylinder's base (15 cm).
- **Key Predicates**:
  1. **Circle(CylinderBase)**: The base of the cylinder is a circle.
  2. **Shape(Cylinder)**: The overall structure before modification is a cylinder.
  3. **Shape(Hemisphere)**: A hemisphere is removed from the top of the cylinder.
  4. **RadiusOf(CylinderBase, 15)**: The radius of the cylinder's base is 15 cm.
  5. **RadiusOf(Hemisphere, 15)**: The radius of the hemisphere is 15 cm.
  6. **HeightOf(Cylinder, 22)**: The height of the cylinder is 22 cm.
  7. **Equals(RadiusOf(CylinderBase), RadiusOf(Hemisphere))**: The radii of the cylinder's base and the hemisphere are equal.

#### Key Measurements:
- Radius of the cylinder's base (\( r \)): \( 15 \) cm
- Height of the cylinder (\( h \)): \( 22 \) cm
- Radius of the hemisphere (\( r \)): \( 15 \) cm

#### What We Need to Find:
The **total surface area** of the resulting solid after removing the hemisphere from the cylinder.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Surface Area Components:
The total surface area of the modified solid consists of:
1. **Curved surface area of the cylinder**.
2. **Base area of the cylinder** (since the top is removed).
3. **Curved surface area of the hemisphere** (since the flat base of the hemisphere is no longer part of the solid).

##### 1. Curved Surface Area of the Cylinder:
The formula for the curved surface area of a cylinder is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi r h
\]
Substituting \( r = 15 \) cm and \( h = 22 \) cm:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Cylinder} = 2\pi (15)(22) = 660\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### 2. Base Area of the Cylinder:
The base area of the cylinder is the area of a circle:
\[
\text{Base Area of Cylinder} = \pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 15 \) cm:
\[
\text{Base Area of Cylinder} = \pi (15)^2 = 225\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### 3. Curved Surface Area of the Hemisphere:
The formula for the curved surface area of a hemisphere is:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi r^2
\]
Substituting \( r = 15 \) cm:
\[
\text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere} = 2\pi (15)^2 = 450\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Total Surface Area of the Modified Solid:
The total surface area is the sum of the curved surface area of the cylinder, the base area of the cylinder, and the curved surface area of the hemisphere:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Curved Surface Area of Cylinder} + \text{Base Area of Cylinder} + \text{Curved Surface Area of Hemisphere}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 660\pi + 225\pi + 450\pi = 1335\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Numerical Approximation:
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 1335 \times 3.14159 = 4191.97 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total surface area of the modified solid is:
\[
\boxed{4191.97 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
