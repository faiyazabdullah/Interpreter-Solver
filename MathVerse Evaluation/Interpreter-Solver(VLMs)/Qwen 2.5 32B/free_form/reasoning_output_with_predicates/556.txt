### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with evaluating expressions related to a unit circle where the point \( P = (0.2, 0.98) \) lies on the circle. The angle \( \theta \) subtended at the origin \( O \) by the radius \( OP \) satisfies \( \tan(\theta) = 4.9 \). We need to deduce the value of \( \theta \) in radians and other related quantities systematically.

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
1. **Circle Properties:**
   - The circle is centered at the origin \( O = (0, 0) \).
   - The circle has a radius of 1 unit, as indicated by the predicate \( \text{Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,P)), 1)} \).

2. **Point Coordinates:**
   - The point \( P \) has coordinates \( (0.2, 0.98) \).
   - The tangent of the angle \( \theta \) formed by the radius \( OP \) with the positive \( x \)-axis is given as \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{0.98}{0.2} = 4.9 \).

3. **Geometric Relationships:**
   - The radius \( OP \) is a segment connecting the origin \( O \) to the point \( P \).
   - The angle \( \theta \) is measured counterclockwise from the positive \( x \)-axis to the line segment \( OP \).

4. **Key Question:**
   - Evaluate \( \theta \) in radians without a calculator, using the given \( \tan(\theta) = 4.9 \).

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Step 2.1: Understanding the Tangent Value**
- The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. Here, \( \tan(\theta) = \frac{0.98}{0.2} = 4.9 \).
- This implies that if we consider a right triangle formed by the radius \( OP \), the vertical component (opposite side) is 0.98, and the horizontal component (adjacent side) is 0.2.

##### **Step 2.2: Using the Unit Circle**
- Since \( P \) lies on the unit circle, the coordinates \( (0.2, 0.98) \) satisfy the equation of the unit circle:
  \[
  x^2 + y^2 = 1.
  \]
  Substituting \( x = 0.2 \) and \( y = 0.98 \):
  \[
  (0.2)^2 + (0.98)^2 = 0.04 + 0.9604 = 1.
  \]
  This confirms that \( P \) lies on the unit circle.

##### **Step 2.3: Relating \( \tan(\theta) \) to \( \theta \)**
- The angle \( \theta \) is such that \( \tan(\theta) = 4.9 \). To find \( \theta \) in radians, we use the arctangent function:
  \[
  \theta = \arctan(4.9).
  \]
- Although we cannot compute \( \arctan(4.9) \) exactly without a calculator, we can approximate it using known trigonometric values and properties.

##### **Step 2.4: Approximation of \( \theta \)**
- The value \( \tan(\theta) = 4.9 \) suggests that \( \theta \) is relatively large, but less than \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians (since \( \tan(\frac{\pi}{2}) \) is undefined).
- From trigonometric tables or known approximations:
  - \( \tan(\frac{\pi}{4}) = 1 \).
  - \( \tan(\frac{\pi}{3}) \approx 1.732 \).
  - \( \tan(\frac{5\pi}{12}) \approx 4.7046 \).
- Since \( 4.9 \) is close to \( 4.7046 \), we estimate \( \theta \approx \frac{5\pi}{12} \).

##### **Step 2.5: Verifying the Estimate**
- The exact value of \( \theta \) is not required for the problem, but we can use the approximation \( \theta \approx \frac{5\pi}{12} \) for further deductions.

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
- The angle \( \theta \) in radians is approximately \( \frac{5\pi}{12} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{5\pi}{12}}
\]
