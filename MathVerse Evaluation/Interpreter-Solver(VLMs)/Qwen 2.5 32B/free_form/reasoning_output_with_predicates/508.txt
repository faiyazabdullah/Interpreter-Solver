QUESTION:
Consider the graph of the line whose x-intercept is 0.5 and y-intercept is 2. What is the slope of the line?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with determining the slope of a line given its x-intercept and y-intercept. The x-intercept is at \( (0.5, 0) \), and the y-intercept is at \( (0, 2) \). The line passes through these two points, and we need to calculate the slope using the formula for the slope between two points.

#### Key Information:
1. **Points**:
   - Point \( A \): \( (0.5, 0) \) (x-intercept)
   - Point \( B \): \( (0, 2) \) (y-intercept)

2. **Line**:
   - The line passes through points \( A \) and \( B \).

3. **Slope Formula**:
   The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \( (x_1, y_1) \) and \( (x_2, y_2) \) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]

### Step-by-Step Deductive Reasoning:

#### Step 1: Identify the Coordinates
From the problem statement and the predicates:
- Point \( A \) has coordinates \( (0.5, 0) \).
- Point \( B \) has coordinates \( (0, 2) \).

#### Step 2: Apply the Slope Formula
Using the coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \):
- \( (x_1, y_1) = (0.5, 0) \)
- \( (x_2, y_2) = (0, 2) \)

Substitute these into the slope formula:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{2 - 0}{0 - 0.5} = \frac{2}{-0.5}
\]

#### Step 3: Simplify the Expression
Simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{2}{-0.5} = 2 \div -0.5 = 2 \times -2 = -4
\]

#### Step 4: Verify the Result
The slope \( m \) is consistent with the geometric interpretation of the line in the image. The line is decreasing (negative slope), and the calculated value matches the steepness observed.

### Conclusion:
The slope of the line is \(-4\).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{-4}\]
