QUESTION:
Takoda is watching the tides off the coast of Cape Cod. For two days, Takoda records the height of the water, $h$, in feet. His results are shown in the graph below, where $t$ corresponds to the number of hours after 12:00 a.m. According to Takoda's research, approximately how much time passes between two consecutive high tides?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
To solve the problem systematically, let us analyze the given graph and deduce the required information step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**

#### **Examine the Image:**
The graph shows a periodic function \( h(t) \), which represents the height of the water in feet as a function of time \( t \) (in hours). Key observations from the graph:
1. The graph is periodic, indicating that the tide heights repeat at regular intervals.
2. The peaks of the graph represent high tides, and the troughs represent low tides.
3. The horizontal axis (\( t \)) corresponds to time in hours since 12:00 a.m.
4. The vertical axis (\( h \)) represents the height of the water in feet.

#### **Key Measurements and Relationships:**
- The graph shows multiple cycles of the tide, with clear peaks and troughs.
- We need to determine the time difference between two consecutive high tides.

#### **Formal Predicates and Visual Integration:**
The points on the graph can be thought of as specific instances in time where the height \( h \) is measured. While the predicates (e.g., Point(A), Point(B)) are provided, they are not directly labeled on the graph. Instead, we will identify key points on the graph (e.g., peaks and troughs) and use their coordinates to reason about the period of the tide.

---

### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

#### **1. Identify High Tides:**
From the graph, the high tides occur at the peaks of the waveform. Let us identify the times corresponding to these peaks:
- The first high tide occurs near \( t = 0 \).
- The next high tide occurs near \( t = 12 \).
- Another high tide occurs near \( t = 24 \).
- Yet another high tide occurs near \( t = 36 \).

#### **2. Calculate the Time Difference Between Consecutive High Tides:**
To find the time difference between two consecutive high tides, we calculate the difference in \( t \)-values between successive peaks:
- The time difference between the first and second high tides is:
  \[
  t_2 - t_1 = 12 - 0 = 12 \text{ hours}
  \]
- The time difference between the second and third high tides is:
  \[
  t_3 - t_2 = 24 - 12 = 12 \text{ hours}
  \]
- The time difference between the third and fourth high tides is:
  \[
  t_4 - t_3 = 36 - 24 = 12 \text{ hours}
  \]

#### **3. Confirm Periodicity:**
The consistent time difference of 12 hours between consecutive high tides confirms that the tide cycle is periodic with a period of 12 hours.

#### **4. Relate to the Question:**
The question asks for the time that passes between two consecutive high tides. From our analysis, this time is consistently 12 hours.

---

### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**

Based on the deductive reasoning chain, the time that passes between two consecutive high tides is **12 hours**.

---

### **Final Answer:**
\[
\boxed{12 \text{ hours}}
\]
