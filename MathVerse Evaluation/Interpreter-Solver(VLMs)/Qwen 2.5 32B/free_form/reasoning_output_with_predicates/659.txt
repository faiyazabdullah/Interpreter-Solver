FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Circle(1)**: The circular bases of the cylinder.
2. **RadiusOf(Line(A,B), Circle(1))**: The radius of the circular base is given as \( r = 43 \, \text{mm} \).
3. **HeightOf(Circle(1), h)**: The height of the cylinder is denoted as \( h \, \text{mm} \).
4. **AreaOf(Circle(1), 27288)**: The total surface area of the cylinder is given as \( S = 27288 \, \text{mm}^2 \).

#### Known Relationships:
- The formula for the total surface area \( S \) of a closed cylinder is:
  \[
  S = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
  \]
  where:
  - \( r \) is the radius of the circular base,
  - \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

#### Goal:
We need to find the height \( h \) of the cylinder, given:
- \( r = 43 \, \text{mm} \),
- \( S = 27288 \, \text{mm}^2 \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Substitute Known Values into the Surface Area Formula
The total surface area \( S \) of the cylinder is given by:
\[
S = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]
Substitute \( r = 43 \) and \( S = 27288 \):
\[
27288 = 2\pi (43)^2 + 2\pi (43)h
\]

#### Step 2.2: Simplify the Equation
First, calculate \( 43^2 \):
\[
43^2 = 1849
\]
Thus:
\[
27288 = 2\pi (1849) + 2\pi (43)h
\]
Simplify further:
\[
27288 = 2\pi \cdot 1849 + 2\pi \cdot 43h
\]
\[
27288 = 3698\pi + 86\pi h
\]

#### Step 2.3: Isolate \( h \)
Factor out \( \pi \) from the terms involving \( h \):
\[
27288 = \pi (3698 + 86h)
\]
Divide both sides by \( \pi \):
\[
\frac{27288}{\pi} = 3698 + 86h
\]
Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
\[
\frac{27288}{3.14159} \approx 8685.99
\]
So:
\[
8685.99 = 3698 + 86h
\]

#### Step 2.4: Solve for \( h \)
Subtract 3698 from both sides:
\[
8685.99 - 3698 = 86h
\]
\[
4987.99 = 86h
\]
Divide both sides by 86:
\[
h \approx \frac{4987.99}{86}
\]
\[
h \approx 57.9999 \approx 58
\]

#### Step 2.5: Round to the Nearest Whole Number
The height \( h \) is approximately 58 mm.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The height \( h \) of the cylinder, rounded to the nearest whole number, is:
\[
\boxed{58}
\]
