QUESTION:
The graph shows an angle $a$ in standard position with its terminal side intersecting the circle at $P\left(-\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29}\right)$. The center of the circle is the origin and the radius of the circle is 1.

Find the value of $\cos a$.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual and Predicate Analysis:
1. **Circle Properties**:
   - The circle has its center at the origin \( O \), i.e., \( O = (0, 0) \).
   - The radius of the circle is given as 1.
   - The circle's equation is \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

2. **Point \( P \)**:
   - The point \( P \) lies on the circle, so it satisfies the circle's equation.
   - Coordinates of \( P \) are given as \( P = \left( -\frac{21}{29}, \frac{20}{29} \right) \).

3. **Angle \( a \)**:
   - The angle \( a \) is formed by the positive \( x \)-axis and the line segment \( OP \), where \( O \) is the origin and \( P \) is the point on the circle.
   - The cosine of angle \( a \) is defined as the \( x \)-coordinate of the point \( P \) divided by the radius of the circle.

4. **Key Relationships**:
   - Since \( P \) lies on the unit circle, the radius \( OP = 1 \).
   - The cosine of the angle \( a \) is given by \( \cos a = \frac{x}{r} \), where \( x \) is the \( x \)-coordinate of \( P \) and \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

#### Specific Question:
We need to find the value of \( \cos a \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Verify that \( P \) Lies on the Circle
The equation of the circle is \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Substituting the coordinates of \( P \):
\[
x = -\frac{21}{29}, \quad y = \frac{20}{29}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = \left( -\frac{21}{29} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{20}{29} \right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{441}{841} + \frac{400}{841}
\]
\[
= \frac{441 + 400}{841} = \frac{841}{841} = 1
\]
Thus, \( P \) satisfies the equation of the circle, confirming that \( P \) lies on the circle.

#### Step 2.2: Use the Definition of Cosine
The cosine of the angle \( a \) is given by:
\[
\cos a = \frac{x}{r}
\]
where \( x \) is the \( x \)-coordinate of \( P \) and \( r \) is the radius of the circle. Here:
\[
x = -\frac{21}{29}, \quad r = 1
\]
\[
\cos a = \frac{-\frac{21}{29}}{1} = -\frac{21}{29}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Confirm the Result
The value of \( \cos a \) is directly determined by the \( x \)-coordinate of the point \( P \) because the radius \( r = 1 \). Therefore, no further calculations are needed.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The value of \( \cos a \) is:
\[
\cos a = -\frac{21}{29}
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{-\frac{21}{29}}
\]
