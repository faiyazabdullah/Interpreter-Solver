QUESTION:
A square pyramid is shown with the following dimensions, splitted by a middle base. Length of middle base is 8, height of upper square pyramid is 2x+3, height of whole square pyramid is 6x+9.

Find an expression for the length L of the base of the pyramid in terms of the variable, x.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Shape**: The figure is a truncated square pyramid.
2. **Dimensions**:
   - Length of the middle base: \( 8 \).
   - Height of the upper pyramid: \( 2x + 3 \).
   - Total height of the whole pyramid: \( 6x + 9 \).
   - Length of the base of the whole pyramid: \( L \).
3. **Relationships**:
   - The upper pyramid and the whole pyramid are similar.
   - The ratio of corresponding heights is equal to the ratio of corresponding base lengths.

#### Visual Cues:
- The middle base separates the whole pyramid into two parts: the upper pyramid and the frustum.
- The bases of the upper pyramid and the whole pyramid are squares.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Similarity of Pyramids
From the predicate `Similar(UpperPyramid, WholePyramid)`, the upper pyramid and the whole pyramid are similar. This implies that the ratios of their corresponding linear dimensions (heights and base side lengths) are equal.

#### Step 2.2: Ratio of Heights
The height of the upper pyramid is given as \( 2x + 3 \), and the total height of the whole pyramid is \( 6x + 9 \). Therefore, the ratio of the heights is:
\[
\frac{\text{Height of Upper Pyramid}}{\text{Height of Whole Pyramid}} = \frac{2x + 3}{6x + 9}.
\]

#### Step 2.3: Ratio of Bases
The base of the upper pyramid is the middle base, which has a side length of \( 8 \). Let the side length of the base of the whole pyramid be \( L \). Since the pyramids are similar, the ratio of the base side lengths is equal to the ratio of the heights:
\[
\frac{\text{Base of Upper Pyramid}}{\text{Base of Whole Pyramid}} = \frac{8}{L}.
\]

#### Step 2.4: Equating Ratios
By the property of similar figures, the ratio of the heights is equal to the ratio of the base side lengths:
\[
\frac{2x + 3}{6x + 9} = \frac{8}{L}.
\]

#### Step 2.5: Solving for \( L \)
Cross-multiply to solve for \( L \):
\[
(2x + 3)L = 8(6x + 9).
\]
Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
(2x + 3)L = 48x + 72.
\]
Divide both sides by \( 2x + 3 \) to isolate \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{48x + 72}{2x + 3}.
\]

#### Step 2.6: Simplify the Expression
Factor the numerator \( 48x + 72 \):
\[
48x + 72 = 24(2x + 3).
\]
Thus, the expression for \( L \) becomes:
\[
L = \frac{24(2x + 3)}{2x + 3}.
\]
Cancel \( 2x + 3 \) (assuming \( 2x + 3 \neq 0 \)):
\[
L = 24.
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The length \( L \) of the base of the pyramid is:
\[
\boxed{24}.
\]
