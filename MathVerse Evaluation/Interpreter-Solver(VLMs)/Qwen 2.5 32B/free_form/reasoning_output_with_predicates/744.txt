QUESTION:
The volume of a cylinder that fits exactly into a sphere is given by the formula:

V=\frac{1}{4}\pi h\left(4r^2-h^2\right)

where r is the radius of the sphere and h is the height of the cylinder.

What is the radius of the sphere if the volume of the cylinder is 13.75\pi cm3 and the height of the cylinder is 5 cm?

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image and Predicates:
1. **Image Description**:
   - A cylinder is inscribed in a sphere.
   - The height of the cylinder is labeled as \( h = 5 \) cm.
   - The radius of the sphere is denoted as \( r \).

2. **Predicates**:
   - **Point($1)**: Represents a point in the geometric figure.
   - **Circle($1)**: Represents the sphere (as a 2D projection).
   - **Shape($2)**: Represents the cylinder.
   - **InscribedIn(Shape($2), Circle($1))**: The cylinder is inscribed in the sphere.
   - **HeightOf(Shape($2), 5)**: The height of the cylinder is 5 cm.
   - **IsRadiusOf(Line($1, $2), Circle($1))**: The line segment connecting two points is the radius of the sphere.
   - **LengthOf(Line($1, $2), Var)**: The length of the radius is a variable \( r \).
   - **Equals(HeightOf(Shape($2)), 5)**: Confirms the height of the cylinder is 5 cm.
   - **IsMidpointOf($1, Line($1, $2))**: The midpoint of the radius line is relevant for the cylinder's placement.

3. **Key Measurements**:
   - Height of the cylinder, \( h = 5 \) cm.
   - Volume of the cylinder, \( V = 13.75\pi \) cm³.
   - Radius of the sphere, \( r \) (to be determined).

4. **Question Objective**:
   - Find the radius \( r \) of the sphere.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Use the Volume Formula for the Cylinder
The volume of the cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
V = \frac{1}{4}\pi h \left( 4r^2 - h^2 \right)
\]
We are given:
- \( V = 13.75\pi \) cm³,
- \( h = 5 \) cm.

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
13.75\pi = \frac{1}{4}\pi (5) \left( 4r^2 - 5^2 \right)
\]

#### Step 2.2: Simplify the Equation
First, cancel out \( \pi \) on both sides:
\[
13.75 = \frac{1}{4} (5) \left( 4r^2 - 25 \right)
\]

Next, simplify the right-hand side:
\[
13.75 = \frac{5}{4} \left( 4r^2 - 25 \right)
\]

Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
55 = 5 \left( 4r^2 - 25 \right)
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
11 = 4r^2 - 25
\]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for \( r^2 \)
Add 25 to both sides:
\[
36 = 4r^2
\]

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
r^2 = 9
\]

Take the square root of both sides:
\[
r = 3
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify the Solution
The radius \( r = 3 \) cm satisfies the volume formula:
\[
V = \frac{1}{4}\pi (5) \left( 4(3)^2 - 5^2 \right) = \frac{1}{4}\pi (5) \left( 36 - 25 \right) = \frac{1}{4}\pi (5) (11) = 13.75\pi
\]
This matches the given volume, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The radius of the sphere is \( r = 3 \) cm.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{3}\]
