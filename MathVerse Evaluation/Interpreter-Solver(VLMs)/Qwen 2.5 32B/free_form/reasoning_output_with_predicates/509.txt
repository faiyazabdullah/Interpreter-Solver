### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Elements:
- The image shows a horizontal line at \( y = 5 \).
- The shaded region is above this line.

#### Predicates:
1. **Line(l)**: There is a line labeled \( l \).
2. **Parallel(l, Line(x))**: The line \( l \) is parallel to the \( x \)-axis.
3. **Equals(5, y)**: The line \( l \) is located at \( y = 5 \).
4. **Shaded(Shape(1))**: There is a shaded region in the figure.
5. **IsBaseOf(Line(l), Shape(1))**: The line \( l \) serves as the base of the shaded region.
6. **AreaOf(Shape(1))**: The area of the shaded region is relevant, though not directly needed for the inequality.

#### Key Observations:
- The line \( l \) is parallel to the \( x \)-axis and lies at \( y = 5 \).
- The shaded region is above this line, indicating all points in the shaded region have \( y \)-coordinates greater than 5.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the equation of the line
- From the predicate **Equals(5, y)**, the equation of the line \( l \) is:
  \[
  y = 5
  \]

#### Step 2.2: Determine the relationship between the shaded region and the line
- The predicate **IsBaseOf(Line(l), Shape(1))** indicates that the line \( l \) acts as the base of the shaded region.
- Since the shaded region is above the line \( y = 5 \), all points in the shaded region satisfy:
  \[
  y > 5
  \]

#### Step 2.3: Formulate the inequality
- The inequality describing the points in the shaded region is:
  \[
  y > 5
  \]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The inequality that describes the points in the shaded region is \( y > 5 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y > 5}
\]
