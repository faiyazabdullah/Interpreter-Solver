FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the surface area of a three-quarter cylinder. The given dimensions are:
- Radius \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \)
- Height \( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \)
- The figure is three-quarters of a full cylinder.

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the problem and the image:
1. The figure is a three-quarter cylinder, meaning it includes:
   - Three-quarters of the lateral surface area of the cylinder.
   - Three-quarters of the top circular face.
   - The bottom circular face (full).
   - Two quarter-circular arc segments at the ends of the cylinder.

2. Key measurements:
   - Radius \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \)
   - Height \( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \)

3. The question asks for the total surface area of this three-quarter cylinder.

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

##### Part 1: Lateral Surface Area
The lateral surface area of a full cylinder is given by:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area (Full Cylinder)} = 2\pi r h
\]
For a three-quarter cylinder, the lateral surface area is:
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area (Three-Quarter Cylinder)} = \frac{3}{4} \times 2\pi r h = \frac{3}{2} \pi r h
\]
Substitute \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \) and \( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Lateral Surface Area} = \frac{3}{2} \pi (5)(12) = \frac{3}{2} \pi \cdot 60 = 90\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### Part 2: Top Circular Face
The area of the full top circular face is:
\[
\text{Area of Full Circle} = \pi r^2
\]
For a three-quarter cylinder, only three-quarters of the top circular face is included:
\[
\text{Top Circular Face Area} = \frac{3}{4} \pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Top Circular Face Area} = \frac{3}{4} \pi (5)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \pi \cdot 25 = \frac{75}{4} \pi = 18.75\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### Part 3: Bottom Circular Face
The bottom circular face is a full circle:
\[
\text{Bottom Circular Face Area} = \pi r^2
\]
Substitute \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Bottom Circular Face Area} = \pi (5)^2 = 25\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### Part 4: Quarter-Circular Arc Segments
At each end of the cylinder, there are two quarter-circular arcs. These arcs form the straight edges of the three-quarter cylinder. The length of each arc is:
\[
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{1}{4} \times 2\pi r = \frac{\pi r}{2}
\]
For \( r = 5 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Arc Length} = \frac{\pi (5)}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{2} \, \text{cm}
\]
There are two such arcs, so the total arc length is:
\[
2 \times \frac{5\pi}{2} = 5\pi \, \text{cm}
\]
These arcs contribute to the surface area as rectangles with height \( h = 12 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
\text{Area of Arc Rectangles} = 2 \times \left( \frac{5\pi}{2} \right) \cdot 12 = 5\pi \cdot 12 = 60\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### Total Surface Area
Now, sum all the components:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = \text{Lateral Surface Area} + \text{Top Circular Face Area} + \text{Bottom Circular Face Area} + \text{Arc Rectangle Area}
\]
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = 90\pi + 18.75\pi + 25\pi + 60\pi
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} = (90 + 18.75 + 25 + 60)\pi = 193.75\pi \, \text{cm}^2
\]

##### Numerical Evaluation
Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
\[
\text{Total Surface Area} \approx 193.75 \times 3.1416 \approx 608.74 \, \text{cm}^2
\]

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The total surface area of the three-quarter cylinder, rounded to two decimal places, is:
\[
\boxed{608.74 \, \text{cm}^2}
\]
