FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Analysis:
- The graph shows a curve with specific points marked.
- The points provided in the predicates are plotted on the graph:
  - \( (-2, -4) \)
  - \( (-1, -2) \)
  - \( (0, 0) \)
  - \( (1, -4) \)
- There is a hollow point at \( (-3, 0) \), indicating that the function does not include this point.
- The curve appears to be smooth and continuous within the given domain.

#### Predicate Analysis:
- The predicates confirm that the points \( (-2, -4) \), \( (-1, -2) \), \( (0, 0) \), and \( (1, -4) \) lie on the function \( f(x) \).
- The hollow point at \( (-3, 0) \) indicates that \( (-3, 0) \) is not included in the function's domain.

#### Key Observations:
- The domain is restricted to the interval \( (-3, 1] \) because:
  - The hollow point at \( (-3, 0) \) excludes \( x = -3 \).
  - The curve extends up to and including \( x = 1 \).
- The range is restricted to the interval \( [-4, 0] \) because:
  - The lowest point on the curve is \( (1, -4) \), giving a minimum value of \( -4 \).
  - The highest point on the curve is \( (0, 0) \), giving a maximum value of \( 0 \).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Domain
- The domain of a function is the set of all possible input values (\( x \)-values) for which the function is defined.
- From the graph:
  - The curve starts just after \( x = -3 \) (hollow point at \( (-3, 0) \)).
  - The curve continues up to and includes \( x = 1 \).
- Therefore, the domain is \( (-3, 1] \).

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Range
- The range of a function is the set of all possible output values (\( y \)-values) that the function can produce.
- From the graph:
  - The lowest point on the curve is \( (1, -4) \), so the minimum value of \( y \) is \( -4 \).
  - The highest point on the curve is \( (0, 0) \), so the maximum value of \( y \) is \( 0 \).
- Therefore, the range is \( [-4, 0] \).

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the systematic deduction from the visual information and the given predicates, the domain and range of the function \( f \) are:

- **Domain**: \( (-3, 1] \)
- **Range**: \( [-4, 0] \)

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Domain: } (-3, 1], \quad \text{Range: } [-4, 0]}
\]
