FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a straight line passing through two points:
  - One point is labeled at $(0, 3)$, which is the y-intercept.
  - Another point is labeled at $(2, 0)$, which is the x-intercept.
- The line is decreasing, indicating a negative slope.

#### From the Predicates:
- **Point(A)**: Represents the point $(0, 3)$.
- **Point(B)**: Represents the point $(2, 0)$.
- **Line(A,B)**: The line passing through points $A$ and $B$.
- **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(A,B))** and **PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,B))**: Confirm that points $A$ and $B$ lie on the line.

#### Key Observations:
- The y-intercept is given as $3$, which corresponds to the point $(0, 3)$.
- The x-intercept is given as $2$, which corresponds to the point $(2, 0)$.
- The task is to determine the equation of the linear function $f(x)$.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: General Form of a Linear Function
The general form of a linear function is:
\[
f(x) = mx + b
\]
where:
- $m$ is the slope of the line.
- $b$ is the y-intercept.

From the problem, the y-intercept $b$ is given as $3$. Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
f(x) = mx + 3
\]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate the Slope ($m$)
The slope $m$ of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Using the points $A(0, 3)$ and $B(2, 0)$:
- $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 3)$
- $(x_2, y_2) = (2, 0)$

Substitute these values into the slope formula:
\[
m = \frac{0 - 3}{2 - 0} = \frac{-3}{2} = -\frac{3}{2}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Substitute the Slope into the Equation
Now that we have the slope $m = -\frac{3}{2}$ and the y-intercept $b = 3$, substitute these into the linear function:
\[
f(x) = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3
\]

#### Step 2.4: Verify the Function
To ensure the function is correct, check if it passes through the given points:
1. At $x = 0$:
   \[
   f(0) = -\frac{3}{2}(0) + 3 = 3
   \]
   This matches the y-intercept $(0, 3)$.

2. At $x = 2$:
   \[
   f(2) = -\frac{3}{2}(2) + 3 = -3 + 3 = 0
   \]
   This matches the x-intercept $(2, 0)$.

Thus, the function correctly passes through both points.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The linear function $f(x)$ is:
\[
f(x) = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{f(x) = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3}
\]
