QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{1}{4} \pi,-2.2\right)$ and a minimum point at $\left(\frac{3}{4} \pi,-8.5\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Function Shape**: The graph depicts a periodic trigonometric function with a sinusoidal pattern.
2. **Maximum Point**: The function reaches its maximum at \( C = \left( \frac{1}{4}\pi, -2.2 \right) \).
3. **Minimum Point**: The function reaches its minimum at \( D = \left( \frac{3}{4}\pi, -8.5 \right) \).
4. **Periodicity**: The function is periodic, meaning it repeats itself over regular intervals.
5. **Axes**: The \( x \)-axis and \( y \)-axis are perpendicular, intersecting at the origin. Points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on these axes but are not directly relevant to the problem.

#### Specific Value to Find:
The **period** of the trigonometric function. The period is the length of one complete cycle of the function.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Identify the Period Definition
The period of a periodic function is the smallest positive value \( T \) such that:
\[ f(x + T) = f(x) \quad \text{for all } x. \]
For trigonometric functions like sine or cosine, the period is determined by the horizontal distance between two consecutive maximum points or two consecutive minimum points.

#### Step 2.2: Analyze the Maximum and Minimum Points
From the given points:
- Maximum point: \( C = \left( \frac{1}{4}\pi, -2.2 \right) \)
- Minimum point: \( D = \left( \frac{3}{4}\pi, -8.5 \right) \)

The horizontal distance between \( C \) and \( D \) is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{3}{4}\pi - \frac{1}{4}\pi = \frac{2}{4}\pi = \frac{\pi}{2}. \]

This distance represents half the period because the function transitions from a maximum to a minimum, completing half a cycle.

#### Step 2.3: Determine the Full Period
Since the distance between the maximum and minimum points is half the period, the full period \( T \) is:
\[ T = 2 \times \frac{\pi}{2} = \pi. \]

#### Step 2.4: Verify Consistency with the Graph
The graph shows a sinusoidal pattern that repeats every \( \pi \) units along the \( x \)-axis, confirming that the period is indeed \( \pi \).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The period of the function is \( \pi \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{\pi}\]
