### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Base of the Prism**:
   - The base is a pentagon (as indicated by the predicate `Pentagon(Base)`).
   - The area of the base is given as \( 30 \, \text{cm}^2 \) (predicate: `Equals(AreaOf(Base), 30)`).

2. **Height of the Prism**:
   - The height of the prism is given as \( 9 \, \text{cm} \) (predicate: `Equals(LengthOf(HeightOf(Prism)), 9)`).

3. **Relationships**:
   - The base is a part of the prism (`IsBaseOf(Base, Prism)`).
   - The prism is a three-dimensional geometric figure (`Prism(Prism)`).

#### Question:
The problem asks us to find the **volume** of the prism. The volume of a prism is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Area of Base} \times \text{Height}
\]

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify Known Quantities
From the given information:
- The area of the base (\(\text{AreaOf(Base)}\)) is \( 30 \, \text{cm}^2 \).
- The height of the prism (\(\text{LengthOf(HeightOf(Prism))}\)) is \( 9 \, \text{cm} \).

#### Step 2.2: Apply the Volume Formula
The volume \( V \) of a prism is given by:
\[
V = \text{Area of Base} \times \text{Height}
\]
Substitute the known values into the formula:
\[
V = 30 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 9 \, \text{cm}
\]

#### Step 2.3: Perform the Calculation
\[
V = 30 \times 9 = 270 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of the prism is \( 270 \, \text{cm}^3 \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{270 \, \text{cm}^3}
\]
