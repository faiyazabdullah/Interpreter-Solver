QUESTION:
Consider the circle on the graph. Its center at the origin and its radius is 7. State the equation of the circle.

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The circle is centered at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The circle appears to have a radius of 7 units (as indicated by the scale on the axes).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Point(O)**: There is a point \( O \) which is the center of the circle.
2. **Circle(O)**: The circle is centered at \( O \).
3. **Equals(0,0)**: The coordinates of \( O \) are \((0, 0)\).
4. **IsRadiusOf(Line(O,A), Circle(O))**: The line segment from \( O \) to \( A \) is a radius of the circle.
5. **LengthOf(Line(O,A))**: The length of the radius is given.
6. **Equals(LengthOf(Line(O,A)), 7)**: The length of the radius is 7 units.
7. **PointLiesOnCircle(A, Circle(O))**: Point \( A \) lies on the circle.

#### Key Information Summarized:
- The center of the circle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).
- The radius of the circle is 7 units.

#### What We Need to Find:
The equation of the circle.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: General Equation of a Circle
The standard form of the equation of a circle with center \((h, k)\) and radius \( r \) is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Substitute Known Values
From the predicates and the image:
- The center \((h, k)\) is \((0, 0)\).
- The radius \( r \) is 7.

Substitute these values into the general equation:
\[
(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2 = 7^2
\]

Simplify:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 49
\]

#### Step 2.3: Verify the Equation
The equation \( x^2 + y^2 = 49 \) represents a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 7, which matches the description from both the image and the predicates.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The equation of the circle is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 49
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{x^2 + y^2 = 49}
\]
