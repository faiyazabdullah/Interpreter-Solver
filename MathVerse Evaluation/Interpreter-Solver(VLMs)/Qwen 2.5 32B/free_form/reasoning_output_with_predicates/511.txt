FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The graph shows a dashed line passing through two points: \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, 6)\).
2. The shaded region is above the dashed line, indicating it represents the solution set of an inequality.
3. The dashed line suggests that the inequality is non-inclusive (i.e., it does not include the line itself).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(-3,0), Line(m))**: The point \((-3, 0)\) lies on the line \(m\).
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,6), Line(m))**: The point \((0, 6)\) lies on the line \(m\).
3. **Line(m)**: The line \(m\) is defined by these points.
4. **Shaded(Shape(1))**: The shaded region is a shape (likely a half-plane).
5. **IsSideOf(Line(m), Shape(1))**: The shaded region is one side of the line \(m\).

#### Key Observations:
- The line \(m\) passes through the points \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, 6)\).
- The shaded region is above the line \(m\), indicating the inequality involves \(y > mx + b\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Equation of the Line \(m\)
The equation of a line can be determined using the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\), where:
- \(m\) is the slope.
- \(b\) is the y-intercept.

##### Calculate the Slope (\(m\)):
The slope \(m\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
\]
Using the points \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, 6)\):
\[
m = \frac{6 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

##### Find the Y-Intercept (\(b\)):
The y-intercept \(b\) is the y-coordinate of the point where the line crosses the y-axis. From the predicate **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,6), Line(m))**, we know the y-intercept is \(6\).

Thus, the equation of the line \(m\) is:
\[
y = 2x + 6
\]

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Inequality
The shaded region is above the line \(y = 2x + 6\). This means the inequality is:
\[
y > 2x + 6
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane is:
\[
y > 2x + 6
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y > 2x + 6}
\]
