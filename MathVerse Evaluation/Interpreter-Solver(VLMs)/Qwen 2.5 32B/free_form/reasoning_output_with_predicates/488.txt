QUESTION:
There is a curve goes through (-4,1), (-1,3), and (0,0). Estimate the intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image:
1. The given curve passes through the points \((-4, 1)\), \((-1, 3)\), and \((0, 0)\).
2. The curve appears to be a polynomial function, likely a cubic polynomial due to its shape and behavior.
3. The curve has a local maximum around \(x = -2\) and a local minimum around \(x = 1\).
4. The function increases on certain intervals and decreases on others.

#### Key Observations from Predicates:
- The predicates confirm that the points \((-4, 1)\), \((-1, 3)\), and \((0, 0)\) lie on the curve described by the function \(y = f(x)\).

#### Goal:
Estimate the intervals on which the function \(f(x)\) is increasing or decreasing.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze the Behavior of the Function
From the image:
- The function is increasing on the left side of the local maximum (around \(x = -2\)).
- The function is decreasing between the local maximum (around \(x = -2\)) and the local minimum (around \(x = 1\)).
- The function is increasing on the right side of the local minimum (around \(x = 1\)).

#### Step 2.2: Identify Key Points
- The local maximum occurs at approximately \(x = -2\).
- The local minimum occurs at approximately \(x = 1\).

#### Step 2.3: Determine Intervals of Increase and Decrease
To determine the intervals of increase and decrease:
1. **Interval \((-\infty, -2)\):** The function is increasing because the curve is rising as \(x\) moves from left to right.
2. **Interval \((-2, 1)\):** The function is decreasing because the curve is falling as \(x\) moves from left to right.
3. **Interval \((1, \infty)\):** The function is increasing because the curve is rising again as \(x\) moves from left to right.

#### Step 2.4: Verify with Given Points
- The point \((-4, 1)\) lies on the increasing portion of the curve.
- The point \((-1, 3)\) lies on the decreasing portion of the curve.
- The point \((0, 0)\) lies on the decreasing portion of the curve, closer to the local minimum.

These observations are consistent with the intervals determined above.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

Based on the analysis:
- The function is increasing on \((-\infty, -2)\) and \((1, \infty)\).
- The function is decreasing on \((-2, 1)\).

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\text{Increasing on } (-\infty, -2) \cup (1, \infty), \text{ Decreasing on } (-2, 1)}
\]
