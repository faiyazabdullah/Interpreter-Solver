QUESTION:
The x-intercept of the line is -1.5 and the y-intercept is 3. State the inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the given image and predicates:
1. The line passes through the points \((-1.5, 0)\) and \((0, 3)\).
   - These are the x-intercept and y-intercept of the line, respectively.
2. The shaded region is above the line, indicating that the inequality involves a "greater than" relationship.
3. The equation of the line can be determined using the intercept form or slope-intercept form.
4. The question asks for the inequality that describes the shaded region.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain
#### Step 2.1: Determine the equation of the line
The line passes through the points \((-1.5, 0)\) and \((0, 3)\). Using the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\):
- The y-intercept \(b\) is given as 3.
- The slope \(m\) is calculated as:
  \[
  m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{3 - 0}{0 - (-1.5)} = \frac{3}{1.5} = 2
  \]
Thus, the equation of the line is:
\[
y = 2x + 3
\]

#### Step 2.2: Analyze the shaded region
The shaded region is above the line \(y = 2x + 3\). This means that for any point \((x, y)\) in the shaded region, the y-coordinate is greater than the y-coordinate on the line at the same x-value. Therefore, the inequality describing the shaded region is:
\[
y > 2x + 3
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The inequality that describes the region drawn in the number plane is:
\[
y > 2x + 3
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y > 2x + 3}
\]
