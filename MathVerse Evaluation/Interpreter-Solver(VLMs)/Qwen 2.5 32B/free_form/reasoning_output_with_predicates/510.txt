QUESTION:

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The image shows a coordinate plane with a shaded region.
2. The boundary of the shaded region is a straight line.
3. The line intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-3, 0)\) and the \(y\)-axis at \((0, -6)\).

#### From the Predicates:
1. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(-3,0), Line(m))**: The point \((-3, 0)\) lies on the line \(m\).
2. **PointLiesOnLine(Point(0,-6), Line(m))**: The point \((0, -6)\) lies on the line \(m\).
3. **Shaded(Region(1))**: The shaded region is the area above the line \(m\).

#### Key Observations:
- The \(x\)-intercept of the line is \(-3\) and the \(y\)-intercept is \(-6\).
- The shaded region is above the line, indicating the inequality will involve the line's equation with a "greater than or equal to" (\(\geq\)) relation.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Equation of the Line
The general form of a line is \(y = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the \(y\)-intercept.

1. **Calculate the Slope (\(m\))**:
   The slope \(m\) is given by:
   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
   \]
   Using the points \((-3, 0)\) and \((0, -6)\):
   \[
   m = \frac{-6 - 0}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{-6}{3} = -2
   \]

2. **Determine the Equation of the Line**:
   The \(y\)-intercept \(b\) is \(-6\). Substituting \(m = -2\) and \(b = -6\) into the slope-intercept form \(y = mx + b\):
   \[
   y = -2x - 6
   \]

#### Step 2.2: Analyze the Shaded Region
The shaded region is above the line \(y = -2x - 6\). This means the inequality describing the shaded region is:
\[
y \geq -2x - 6
\]

#### Step 2.3: Verify the Inequality
- The line \(y = -2x - 6\) divides the plane into two regions: above and below.
- The shaded region is above the line, so the inequality must include all points \((x, y)\) such that \(y \geq -2x - 6\).

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The inequality that describes the shaded region in the coordinate plane is:
\[
y \geq -2x - 6
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{y \geq -2x - 6}
\]
