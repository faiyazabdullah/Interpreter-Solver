### Problem Analysis:
The problem involves determining the remaining area in a larger rectangle after subtracting the area of a smaller rectangle. Here's a breakdown of the given information:

1. **Total Area of the Larger Rectangle (Rectangle 1)**:
   - Predicated as: \( \text{AreaOf}(1) = 6096 \).

2. **Area of the Smaller Orange Rectangle (Rectangle 2)**:
   - Predicated as: \( \text{AreaOf}(2) = 6000 \).

3. **Relationship Between Areas**:
   - The question asks for the remaining area, which is the difference between the total area of the larger rectangle and the area of the smaller orange rectangle.
   - This relationship is predicated as: \( \text{Sub}(\text{AreaOf}(1), \text{AreaOf}(2)) \).

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Understand the Geometric Setup**
- The image shows a larger rectangle divided into two sections: an orange section and a white section.
- The orange section has an area of 6000, and the total area of the larger rectangle is 6096.
- The white section represents the remaining area, which we need to calculate.

#### **Step 2: Apply the Subtraction Predicate**
- The predicate \( \text{Sub}(\text{AreaOf}(1), \text{AreaOf}(2)) \) indicates that we need to subtract the area of the smaller rectangle (orange section) from the total area of the larger rectangle.
- Mathematically, this is expressed as:
  \[
  \text{Remaining Area} = \text{AreaOf}(1) - \text{AreaOf}(2)
  \]

#### **Step 3: Perform the Calculation**
- Substitute the given values:
  \[
  \text{Remaining Area} = 6096 - 6000
  \]
- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  \text{Remaining Area} = 96
  \]

#### **Step 4: Verify the Result**
- The total area of the larger rectangle is 6096.
- The area of the orange section is 6000.
- Subtracting these gives 96, which matches the remaining white section in the image.

### Conclusion:
The remaining area is the difference between the total area of the larger rectangle and the area of the orange rectangle. Based on the deduction, the remaining area is 96.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{96}\]
