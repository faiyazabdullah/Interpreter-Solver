QUESTION:
An empty glass jar weighing 250g is in the shape of a cylinder which has a radius (r) of 15 cm and a height (h) of 26 cm.

Calculate its total weight when it is filled with water, correct to 2 decimal places.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with calculating the total weight of a cylindrical glass jar when it is filled with water. The given information includes:
- The shape of the jar is a cylinder.
- The radius \( r \) of the cylinder is 15 cm.
- The height \( h \) of the cylinder is 26 cm.
- The empty glass jar weighs 250 g.
- The density of water is approximately \( 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \).

### Step-by-Step Deductive Reasoning:

#### **Step 1: Critical Information Analysis**
From the image and predicates:
1. The shape is a cylinder.
2. The radius \( r = 15 \, \text{cm} \).
3. The height \( h = 26 \, \text{cm} \).
4. The empty jar weighs \( 250 \, \text{g} \).
5. Water's density is \( 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \).

The goal is to calculate the total weight of the jar when it is filled with water. This involves:
- Calculating the volume of the cylinder.
- Using the density of water to find the mass of the water.
- Adding the mass of the water to the weight of the empty jar.

#### **Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain**

##### **Substep 2.1: Calculate the Volume of the Cylinder**
The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius,
- \( h \) is the height.

Substitute the given values \( r = 15 \, \text{cm} \) and \( h = 26 \, \text{cm} \):
\[
V = \pi (15)^2 (26)
\]
\[
V = \pi (225)(26)
\]
\[
V = 5850\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
\[
V \approx 5850 \times 3.1416
\]
\[
V \approx 18377.16 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

##### **Substep 2.2: Calculate the Mass of the Water**
The density of water is \( 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \). The mass \( m \) of the water is given by:
\[
m = \text{density} \times \text{volume}
\]
\[
m = 1 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \times 18377.16 \, \text{cm}^3
\]
\[
m \approx 18377.16 \, \text{g}
\]

##### **Substep 2.3: Calculate the Total Weight of the Jar When Filled with Water**
The total weight is the sum of the weight of the empty jar and the mass of the water:
\[
\text{Total Weight} = \text{Weight of Empty Jar} + \text{Mass of Water}
\]
\[
\text{Total Weight} = 250 \, \text{g} + 18377.16 \, \text{g}
\]
\[
\text{Total Weight} \approx 18627.16 \, \text{g}
\]

#### **Step 3: Conclusion and Selection**
The total weight of the jar when it is filled with water is approximately \( 18627.16 \, \text{g} \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{18627.16 \, \text{g}}
\]
