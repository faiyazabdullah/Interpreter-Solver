QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the amplitude of the function?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph depicts a trigonometric function.
- The function has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$.
- The function has a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$.
- The vertical distance between the minimum and maximum points is the total variation in the function's values.

#### From the Predicates:
- Point $A$ lies on the graph at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$.
- Point $B$ lies on the graph at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$.
- These points represent the minimum and maximum values of the function, respectively.

#### Key Measurements:
- Minimum point: $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$.
- Maximum point: $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$.
- Vertical distance between the minimum and maximum points: $13 - 2.4 = 10.6$.

#### Specific Value Asked:
The question asks for the amplitude of the function. The amplitude of a trigonometric function is half the distance between its maximum and minimum values.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Vertical Distance Between Maximum and Minimum
The maximum value of the function is $13$, and the minimum value is $2.4$. The total vertical distance between these two points is:
\[
\text{Vertical distance} = 13 - 2.4 = 10.6
\]

#### Step 2.2: Relate the Vertical Distance to Amplitude
The amplitude of a trigonometric function is defined as half the distance between its maximum and minimum values. Therefore:
\[
\text{Amplitude} = \frac{\text{Vertical distance}}{2} = \frac{10.6}{2} = 5.3
\]

#### Step 2.3: Verify Consistency with the Graph
From the graph, the function oscillates symmetrically around its midline. The midline is the average of the maximum and minimum values:
\[
\text{Midline} = \frac{\text{Maximum} + \text{Minimum}}{2} = \frac{13 + 2.4}{2} = \frac{15.4}{2} = 7.7
\]
The distance from the midline to the maximum or minimum is indeed $5.3$, confirming the amplitude calculation.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The amplitude of the function is:
\[
\boxed{5.3}
\]
