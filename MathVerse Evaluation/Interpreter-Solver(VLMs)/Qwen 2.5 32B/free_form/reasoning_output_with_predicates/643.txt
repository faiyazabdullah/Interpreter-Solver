### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The figure depicts a cone.
2. The base of the cone is a circle.
3. A vertical line segment represents the height of the cone, which is perpendicular to the base.
4. The radius of the circular base is labeled as 2 cm.
5. The height of the cone is labeled as 6 cm.

#### From the Predicates:
1. **Point(A)**: A point that may be part of the geometry but does not directly affect the calculation here.
2. **Circle(A)**: Describes the circular base of the cone.
3. **IsRadiusOf(Line(A), Circle(A))**: Indicates that the line representing the radius of the circle is related to the circle's center.
4. **LengthOf(Line(A))**: The length of the radius line is given as 2 cm.
5. **LengthOf(Line($))**: The length of the height line is given as 6 cm.
6. **Perpendicular(Line(A), Line($))**: The height is perpendicular to the base.
7. **RightAngle(Angle(A))**: Confirms the right angle formed by the height and the base.

#### Key Measurements:
- Radius of the base ($r$) = 2 cm.
- Height of the cone ($h$) = 6 cm.

#### Question:
We are tasked with finding the volume of the cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]
where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cone.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Required Formula
The volume of a cone is given by:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]
This formula is derived from the fact that a cone is a solid of revolution obtained by rotating a right triangle about one of its legs. The volume is one-third the product of the base area ($\pi r^2$) and the height ($h$).

#### Step 2.2: Substitute Known Values
From the problem:
- $r = 2$ cm
- $h = 6$ cm

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (2)^2 (6)
\]

#### Step 2.3: Simplify the Expression
First, calculate $r^2$:
\[
r^2 = 2^2 = 4
\]
Next, multiply $r^2$ by $h$:
\[
r^2 \cdot h = 4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
Now, multiply by $\frac{1}{3}$:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi \cdot 24 = 8\pi
\]

#### Step 2.4: Approximate the Value
Using $\pi \approx 3.14159$, we calculate:
\[
V \approx 8 \cdot 3.14159 = 25.13272
\]
Rounding to two decimal places:
\[
V \approx 25.13
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The volume of the cone is approximately $25.13$ cubic centimeters.

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{25.13 \text{ cm}^3}
\]
