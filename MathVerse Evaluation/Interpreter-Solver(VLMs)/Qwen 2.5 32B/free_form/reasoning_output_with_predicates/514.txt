QUESTION:
The graph shows the temperature of a room after the heater has been turned on. What is the slope of the shown function that passes the point (0, 1)?

====================================================================================================
FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Visual Information from the Graph:
- The graph shows a straight line representing the temperature of a room over time.
- The temperature is measured in degrees Celsius on the vertical axis.
- Time is measured in minutes on the horizontal axis.
- The line passes through the point \((0, 1)\).
- The line appears to have a constant slope, indicating a linear relationship between temperature and time.

#### Key Points from the Graph:
- At \( t = 0 \) minutes, the temperature is \( T = 1 \) degree Celsius.
- At \( t = 20 \) minutes, the temperature is approximately \( T = 5.5 \) degrees Celsius.

#### Formal Predicates:
- **Point(A)** and **Point(B)**: These represent points on the graph.
- **Line(A,B)**: The line passing through points \( A \) and \( B \).
- **PointLiesOnLine(A, Line(A,B))** and **PointLiesOnLine(B, Line(A,B))**: Confirm that points \( A \) and \( B \) lie on the line.
- **Perpendicular(Line(A), Line(B))**: Not relevant here since we are dealing with a single line.

#### Question:
We need to determine the slope of the linear function represented by the graph, given that it passes through the point \((0, 1)\).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the General Form of a Linear Function
The general form of a linear function is:
\[
T(t) = mt + b
\]
where:
- \( m \) is the slope of the line,
- \( b \) is the y-intercept (the value of \( T \) when \( t = 0 \)).

From the graph, the line passes through the point \((0, 1)\). Therefore, the y-intercept \( b \) is:
\[
b = 1
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
T(t) = mt + 1
\]

#### Step 2.2: Use Another Point to Find the Slope
The graph also shows that at \( t = 20 \) minutes, the temperature is approximately \( T = 5.5 \) degrees Celsius. This gives us another point \((20, 5.5)\).

The slope \( m \) of a line passing through two points \((t_1, T_1)\) and \((t_2, T_2)\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{T_2 - T_1}{t_2 - t_1}
\]
Substituting the points \((0, 1)\) and \((20, 5.5)\):
\[
m = \frac{5.5 - 1}{20 - 0} = \frac{4.5}{20} = 0.225
\]

#### Step 2.3: Verify the Slope
The slope \( m = 0.225 \) indicates that the temperature increases by 0.225 degrees Celsius per minute. This matches the linear trend observed in the graph.

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The slope of the linear function that passes through the point \((0, 1)\) is \( 0.225 \).

Final Answer: \[\boxed{0.225}\]
