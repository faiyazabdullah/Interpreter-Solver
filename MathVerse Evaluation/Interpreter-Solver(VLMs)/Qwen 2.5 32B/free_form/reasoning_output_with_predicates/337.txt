### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with finding the true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( B \). The given information includes:
- Triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with vertices \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
- \( \angle A = 37^\circ \) and \( \angle B = 48^\circ \).

#### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the predicates and the image:
1. **Points**: \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).
2. **Lines**: \( AB \), \( AC \), and \( BC \).
3. **Triangle**: \( \triangle ABC \).
4. **Angles**: \( \angle A = 37^\circ \) and \( \angle B = 48^\circ \).

The goal is to determine the true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( B \). True bearing refers to the direction measured clockwise from the north direction.

#### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

##### Step 2.1: Determine \( \angle C \)
In any triangle, the sum of the interior angles is \( 180^\circ \). Using this property:
\[
\angle A + \angle B + \angle C = 180^\circ
\]
Substitute the given values:
\[
37^\circ + 48^\circ + \angle C = 180^\circ
\]
\[
85^\circ + \angle C = 180^\circ
\]
\[
\angle C = 180^\circ - 85^\circ = 95^\circ
\]

Thus, \( \angle C = 95^\circ \).

##### Step 2.2: Interpret the Bearings
The problem asks for the true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( B \). To determine this, we need to analyze the orientation of the triangle relative to the cardinal directions (north, south, east, west).

- The dashed lines in the image suggest that the directions of \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are oriented such that \( B \) is directly to the east of \( A \). This implies that the line \( AB \) is horizontal, pointing eastward.
- The true bearing is measured clockwise from the north direction.

Given that \( B \) is directly east of \( A \), the true bearing of \( A \) from \( B \) is simply the reverse direction: west. In terms of true bearings, west corresponds to \( 270^\circ \) (measured clockwise from north).

##### Step 2.3: Verify Consistency
The angles \( \angle A = 37^\circ \) and \( \angle B = 48^\circ \) are internal angles of the triangle and do not affect the true bearing calculation directly. The true bearing is determined solely by the orientation of points \( A \) and \( B \) relative to the cardinal directions, which is explicitly indicated in the image.

#### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The true bearing of point \( A \) from point \( B \) is \( 270^\circ \).

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{270^\circ}
\]
