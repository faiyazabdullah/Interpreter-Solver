QUESTION:
In remote locations, photographers must keep track of their position from their base. One morning a photographer sets out from base, represented by point B, to the edge of an ice shelf at point S on a bearing of 055°. She then walked on a bearing of 145° to point P, which is 916 metres due east of base.

If the photographer were to walk back to her base from point P, what is the total distance she would have travelled? Round your answer to one decimal place.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Points and Lines**:
   - Points: \( B \), \( S \), \( P \), \( N \).
   - Lines: \( \overline{NB} \), \( \overline{BS} \), \( \overline{SP} \), \( \overline{BP} \).

2. **Angles**:
   - \( \angle PBN = 90^\circ \) (Right angle).
   - \( \angle NBS = 55^\circ \).
   - \( \angle NSP = 145^\circ \).
   - \( \angle SBP = 35^\circ \).
   - \( \angle BSP = 35^\circ \).
   - \( \angle SPB = 110^\circ \).

3. **Distances**:
   - \( BP = 916 \) meters.

4. **Bearing Relationships**:
   - The photographer walks from \( B \) to \( S \) on a bearing of \( 055^\circ \).
   - From \( S \) to \( P \) on a bearing of \( 145^\circ \).
   - Point \( P \) is 916 meters due east of \( B \).

#### Specific Question:
We need to calculate the total distance the photographer would travel if she walks back from point \( P \) to her base \( B \). This involves determining the distances \( BS \) and \( SP \).

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Analyze Triangle \( BSP \)
From the given information:
- \( \angle SBP = 35^\circ \).
- \( \angle BSP = 35^\circ \).
- \( \angle SPB = 110^\circ \).

This makes \( \triangle BSP \) an isosceles triangle with \( BS = SP \).

#### Step 2.2: Use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BSP \)
The Law of Sines states:
\[
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
\]
Here, let:
- \( a = BP = 916 \) meters,
- \( b = BS \),
- \( c = SP \),
- \( \angle SBP = 35^\circ \),
- \( \angle BSP = 35^\circ \),
- \( \angle SPB = 110^\circ \).

Since \( BS = SP \), we can use the Law of Sines to find \( BS \):
\[
\frac{BP}{\sin \angle BSP} = \frac{BS}{\sin \angle SPB}
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\frac{916}{\sin 35^\circ} = \frac{BS}{\sin 110^\circ}
\]
Using \( \sin 110^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \sin 70^\circ \):
\[
\frac{916}{\sin 35^\circ} = \frac{BS}{\sin 70^\circ}
\]
Calculate \( \sin 35^\circ \approx 0.5736 \) and \( \sin 70^\circ \approx 0.9397 \):
\[
\frac{916}{0.5736} = \frac{BS}{0.9397}
\]
\[
1596.74 = \frac{BS}{0.9397}
\]
Solve for \( BS \):
\[
BS = 1596.74 \times 0.9397 \approx 1500.00 \text{ meters}
\]
Thus, \( BS = SP = 1500 \) meters.

#### Step 2.3: Calculate the Total Distance Traveled
The total distance traveled by the photographer is the sum of the distances:
- From \( B \) to \( S \): \( BS = 1500 \) meters.
- From \( S \) to \( P \): \( SP = 1500 \) meters.
- From \( P \) back to \( B \): \( BP = 916 \) meters.

Total distance:
\[
BS + SP + BP = 1500 + 1500 + 916 = 3916 \text{ meters}
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The total distance the photographer would have traveled is:
\[
\boxed{3916}
\]
