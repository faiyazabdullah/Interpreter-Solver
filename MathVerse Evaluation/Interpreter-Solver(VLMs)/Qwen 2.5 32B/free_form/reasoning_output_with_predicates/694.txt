QUESTION:
Xavier's mother told him to drink 4 glasses of water each day. She gave him a cylindrical glass with radius 4 cm.

If Xavier follows this drinking routine for a week, how many litres of water would he drink altogether?

Round your answer to one decimal place.

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
We are tasked with calculating the total volume of water Xavier drinks in a week if he follows his mother's advice to drink 4 glasses of water each day. The dimensions of the cylindrical glass are given:
- Radius of the base of the cylinder: \(4 \, \text{cm}\)
- Height of the cylinder: \(11 \, \text{cm}\)

Using these dimensions, we will calculate the volume of one glass of water, then determine the total volume Xavier drinks in a week.

---

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis
From the image and predicates:
1. The geometric figure is a **cylinder**.
2. The **radius** of the circular base is given as \(4 \, \text{cm}\).
3. The **height** of the cylinder is given as \(11 \, \text{cm}\).

Key measurements:
- Radius (\(r\)): \(4 \, \text{cm}\)
- Height (\(h\)): \(11 \, \text{cm}\)

The question asks for the total volume of water Xavier drinks in a week. To solve this, we need:
1. Calculate the volume of one glass of water.
2. Multiply the volume of one glass by the number of glasses Xavier drinks per day (4).
3. Multiply the result by the number of days in a week (7).
4. Convert the final volume from cubic centimeters (\(\text{cm}^3\)) to liters (\(\text{L}\)).

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Volume of One Glass of Water
The formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where:
- \(r\) is the radius of the base,
- \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

Substitute the given values:
\[
r = 4 \, \text{cm}, \quad h = 11 \, \text{cm}
\]
\[
V = \pi (4)^2 (11) = \pi (16) (11) = 176\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.2: Total Volume Drunk per Day
Xavier drinks 4 glasses of water per day. Therefore, the total volume of water he drinks in one day is:
\[
V_{\text{daily}} = 4 \times 176\pi = 704\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.3: Total Volume Drunk in a Week
There are 7 days in a week. Thus, the total volume of water Xavier drinks in a week is:
\[
V_{\text{weekly}} = 7 \times 704\pi = 4928\pi \, \text{cm}^3
\]

#### Step 2.4: Conversion to Liters
Since \(1 \, \text{L} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3\), we convert the total volume from \(\text{cm}^3\) to \(\text{L}\):
\[
V_{\text{weekly}} = \frac{4928\pi}{1000} \, \text{L}
\]
Using \(\pi \approx 3.1416\):
\[
V_{\text{weekly}} \approx \frac{4928 \times 3.1416}{1000} = \frac{15477.1248}{1000} \approx 15.4771248 \, \text{L}
\]

Rounding to one decimal place:
\[
V_{\text{weekly}} \approx 15.5 \, \text{L}
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection
The total volume of water Xavier drinks in a week, rounded to one decimal place, is:
\[
\boxed{15.5 \, \text{L}}
\]

Final Answer: \[\boxed{15.5 \, \text{L}}\]
