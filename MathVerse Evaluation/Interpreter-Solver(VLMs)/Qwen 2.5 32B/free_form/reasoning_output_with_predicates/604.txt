QUESTION:
The graph with 2 linear functions shows the progress of two competitors in a cycling race. In the graph, the x-axis represents Time and the y-axis represents Distance.

How much faster is Oliver traveling?

FINAL RESPONSE:
====================================================================================================
### Problem Analysis:
The graph shows two linear functions representing the progress of two cyclists, Oliver and Justin, in a race. The x-axis represents time (in hours), and the y-axis represents distance (in kilometers). We need to determine how much faster Oliver is traveling compared to Justin.

#### Key Information from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Oliver's Line**:
   - Passes through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((5, 175)\).
   - This indicates Oliver starts at \(0\) km at \(t = 0\) and reaches \(175\) km at \(t = 5\) hours.

2. **Justin's Line**:
   - Passes through the points \((1, 25)\) and \((5, 125)\).
   - This indicates Justin starts at \(25\) km at \(t = 1\) hour and reaches \(125\) km at \(t = 5\) hours.

3. **Objective**:
   - Calculate the speeds of Oliver and Justin.
   - Determine the difference in their speeds to find how much faster Oliver is traveling.

---

### Step-by-Step Deduction:

#### **Step 1: Calculate Oliver's Speed**
Oliver's line passes through the points \((0, 0)\) and \((5, 175)\).

- **Speed** is defined as the rate of change of distance with respect to time, i.e., the slope of the line.
- The formula for the slope \(m\) between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
  \[
  m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}
  \]

- Applying this to Oliver's line:
  \[
  m_{\text{Oliver}} = \frac{175 - 0}{5 - 0} = \frac{175}{5} = 35 \text{ km/h}
  \]

Thus, Oliver's speed is \(35\) km/h.

#### **Step 2: Calculate Justin's Speed**
Justin's line passes through the points \((1, 25)\) and \((5, 125)\).

- Using the same slope formula:
  \[
  m_{\text{Justin}} = \frac{125 - 25}{5 - 1} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ km/h}
  \]

Thus, Justin's speed is \(25\) km/h.

#### **Step 3: Determine How Much Faster Oliver Is**
To find how much faster Oliver is traveling compared to Justin, subtract Justin's speed from Oliver's speed:
\[
\text{Difference in speed} = m_{\text{Oliver}} - m_{\text{Justin}} = 35 - 25 = 10 \text{ km/h}
\]

---

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{10 \text{ km/h}}
\]
