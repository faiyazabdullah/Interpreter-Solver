QUESTION:
Below is the graph of a trigonometric function. It has a minimum point at $\left(-\frac{1}{2} \pi, 2.4\right)$ and a maximum point at $\left(\frac{3}{2} \pi, 13\right)$. What is the period of the function? Give an exact value.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
- The graph shows a trigonometric function with a smooth, periodic nature.
- Key points identified:
  - Minimum point: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 2.4\right)$
  - Maximum point: $\left(\frac{3}{2}\pi, 13\right)$
- The function appears to oscillate symmetrically around a horizontal axis, suggesting it could be a sine or cosine function.

#### From the Predicates:
- **Minimum Point:**
  - Coordinates: $\left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi, 2.4\right)$
  - This corresponds to the given predicate:
    - $A = -\frac{1}{2}$, $A \cdot \pi = -\frac{1}{2}\pi$, and $A = 2.4$.
- **Maximum Point:**
  - Coordinates: $\left(\frac{3}{2}\pi, 13\right)$
  - This corresponds to the given predicate:
    - $B = \frac{3}{2}$, $B \cdot \pi = \frac{3}{2}\pi$, and $B = 13$.

#### Key Measurements:
- The minimum point is at $x = -\frac{1}{2}\pi$.
- The maximum point is at $x = \frac{3}{2}\pi$.
- These points are critical for determining the period of the function.

#### Question:
We are asked to find the period of the trigonometric function. The period is the horizontal distance over which the function repeats itself.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Identify the Periodic Nature
- The function is periodic, meaning it repeats its values over regular intervals.
- The period is the smallest positive value $P$ such that the function satisfies $f(x + P) = f(x)$ for all $x$.

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Horizontal Distance Between Key Points
- The minimum point occurs at $x = -\frac{1}{2}\pi$.
- The maximum point occurs at $x = \frac{3}{2}\pi$.
- The horizontal distance between these two points is:
  $$
  \text{Distance} = \frac{3}{2}\pi - \left(-\frac{1}{2}\pi\right) = \frac{3}{2}\pi + \frac{1}{2}\pi = 2\pi.
  $$

#### Step 2.3: Analyze the Symmetry of the Function
- Trigonometric functions like sine and cosine are symmetric and oscillate between their maximum and minimum values.
- The distance between the minimum point and the maximum point ($2\pi$) represents half the period of the function. This is because the function must continue to repeat its pattern symmetrically after reaching the next minimum or maximum point.

#### Step 2.4: Calculate the Full Period
- Since the distance between the minimum and maximum points is $2\pi$, the full period $P$ of the function is twice this distance:
  $$
  P = 2 \times 2\pi = 4\pi.
  $$

#### Step 2.5: Verify the Period
- The period of a standard sine or cosine function is $2\pi$. However, the given function has been horizontally stretched or compressed. The observed period of $4\pi$ confirms this stretching.

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The period of the trigonometric function is $4\pi$.

Final Answer: \[\boxed{4\pi}\]
