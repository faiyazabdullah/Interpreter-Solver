QUESTION:
Given the graph of the ellipse that intersects with x-axis at -0.5 and -3.5 and with y-axis at 2, determine its equation.

FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### From the Image:
1. The given figure is an ellipse centered at the origin.
2. The ellipse intersects the **x-axis** at points \((-0.5, 0)\) and \((-3.5, 0)\).
3. The ellipse intersects the **y-axis** at points \((0, 2)\) and \((0, -2)\).

#### From the Predicates:
- The points \((-0.5, 0)\), \((-3.5, 0)\), and \((0, 2)\) lie on the ellipse, which aligns with the observations from the image.
- These points provide critical information about the dimensions of the ellipse.

#### Key Observations:
- The ellipse is symmetric about both the \(x\)-axis and \(y\)-axis.
- The **major axis** of the ellipse lies along the \(x\)-axis because the distance between the intersections on the \(x\)-axis (\(-0.5\) and \(-3.5\)) is greater than the distance between the intersections on the \(y\)-axis (\(2\) and \(-2\)).
- The **semi-major axis** (\(a\)) is half the distance between the \(x\)-intercepts.
- The **semi-minor axis** (\(b\)) is half the distance between the \(y\)-intercepts.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Determine the Semi-Major Axis (\(a\))
The ellipse intersects the \(x\)-axis at \((-0.5, 0)\) and \((-3.5, 0)\). The length of the major axis is the distance between these two points:
\[
\text{Length of major axis} = |-0.5 - (-3.5)| = |-0.5 + 3.5| = 3
\]
The semi-major axis \(a\) is half of this length:
\[
a = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5
\]

#### Step 2.2: Determine the Semi-Minor Axis (\(b\))
The ellipse intersects the \(y\)-axis at \((0, 2)\) and \((0, -2)\). The length of the minor axis is the distance between these two points:
\[
\text{Length of minor axis} = |2 - (-2)| = |2 + 2| = 4
\]
The semi-minor axis \(b\) is half of this length:
\[
b = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

#### Step 2.3: Write the Equation of the Ellipse
The standard form of the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin \((0, 0)\) with a horizontal major axis is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
Substitute \(a = 1.5\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
a^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25, \quad b^2 = (2)^2 = 4
\]
Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{x^2}{2.25} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1
\]

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The equation of the ellipse is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{2.25} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1
\]

### Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{\frac{x^2}{2.25} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1}
\]

EXTRACTED MATHEMATICAL ANSWER: $\frac{x^2}{2.25} + \frac{y^2}{4} = 1$
