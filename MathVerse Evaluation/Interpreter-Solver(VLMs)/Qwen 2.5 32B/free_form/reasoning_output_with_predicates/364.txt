QUESTION:
A suspension bridge is being built. The top of the concrete tower is 35.5 metres above the bridge and the connection point for the main cable is 65.9 metres from the tower.

Assume that the concrete tower and the bridge are perpendicular to each other.

If the length of the cable is h metres, find h to two decimal places.

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Information from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Geometric Configuration**:
   - The concrete tower is perpendicular to the bridge, forming a right angle at the base.
   - The main cable forms the hypotenuse of a right triangle, where the tower and half of the base form the legs.

2. **Measurements**:
   - Height of the tower: \( \text{LengthOf}(Tower) = 35.5 \) meters.
   - Length of the base (distance from the tower to the connection point): \( \text{LengthOf(Base)} = 65.9 \) meters.
   - Half of the base: \( \text{LengthOf(BaseHalf)} = \frac{\text{LengthOf(Base)}}{2} = \frac{65.9}{2} = 32.95 \) meters.

3. **Key Relationships**:
   - The cable is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the tower, half the base, and the cable.
   - By the Pythagorean theorem: 
     \[
     \text{LengthOf}(Cable)^2 = \text{LengthOf}(Tower)^2 + \text{LengthOf}(BaseHalf)^2
     \]

4. **What We Need to Find**:
   - The length of the cable (\( h \)) to two decimal places.

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Step 2.1: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem
From the predicates, we know:
\[
\text{LengthOf}(Cable)^2 = \text{LengthOf}(Tower)^2 + \text{LengthOf}(BaseHalf)^2
\]
Substitute the known values:
\[
\text{LengthOf}(Tower) = 35.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \text{LengthOf}(BaseHalf) = 32.95
\]
Thus:
\[
\text{LengthOf}(Cable)^2 = 35.5^2 + 32.95^2
\]

#### Step 2.2: Calculate Each Term
1. Calculate \( 35.5^2 \):
   \[
   35.5^2 = 1260.25
   \]

2. Calculate \( 32.95^2 \):
   \[
   32.95^2 = 1085.7025
   \]

3. Add the results:
   \[
   \text{LengthOf}(Cable)^2 = 1260.25 + 1085.7025 = 2345.9525
   \]

#### Step 2.3: Solve for \( \text{LengthOf}(Cable) \)
Take the square root of both sides to find the length of the cable:
\[
\text{LengthOf}(Cable) = \sqrt{2345.9525}
\]
Using a calculator:
\[
\text{LengthOf}(Cable) \approx 48.43
\]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The length of the cable is approximately \( 48.43 \) meters. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{48.43}
\]
