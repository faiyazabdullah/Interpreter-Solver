FINAL RESPONSE:

### Step 1: Critical Information Analysis

#### Key Observations from the Image and Predicates:
1. **Shape**: The figure is a cylinder.
2. **Base Circle**: The base of the cylinder is a circle with a given radius.
3. **Dimensions**:
   - Radius of the base circle: \( r = 10 \) cm (from `Equals(LengthOf(radius), 10)`).
   - Height of the cylinder: \( h = 35 \) cm (from `Equals(LengthOf(height), 35)`).

#### Specific Value Asked For:
The problem asks for the **surface area** of the cylinder.

#### Visual and Predicate Integration:
- The base circle has a radius of 10 cm, which means the diameter is \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) cm.
- The height of the cylinder is 35 cm.
- The surface area of a cylinder includes:
  1. The lateral surface area.
  2. The areas of the two circular bases.

---

### Step 2: Deductive Reasoning Chain

#### Formula for Surface Area of a Cylinder:
The total surface area \( A \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh
\]
where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base circle,
- \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

#### Substituting Known Values:
From the predicates:
- \( r = 10 \) cm,
- \( h = 35 \) cm.

1. **Area of the Two Circular Bases**:
   The area of one circular base is:
   \[
   \pi r^2 = \pi (10)^2 = 100\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
   \]
   Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:
   \[
   2 \pi r^2 = 2 \times 100\pi = 200\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
   \]

2. **Lateral Surface Area**:
   The lateral surface area is the area of the curved surface, which is given by:
   \[
   2\pi rh = 2\pi (10)(35) = 700\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
   \]

3. **Total Surface Area**:
   Adding the areas of the two bases and the lateral surface area:
   \[
   A = 2\pi r^2 + 2\pi rh = 200\pi + 700\pi = 900\pi \quad \text{cm}^2
   \]

4. **Numerical Approximation**:
   Using \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \):
   \[
   A \approx 900 \times 3.14159 = 2827.431 \quad \text{cm}^2
   \]
   Rounding to two decimal places:
   \[
   A \approx 2827.43 \quad \text{cm}^2
   \]

---

### Step 3: Conclusion and Selection

The surface area of the cylinder is:
\[
\boxed{2827.43 \text{ cm}^2}
\]
